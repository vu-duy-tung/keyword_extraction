    "text": "Went here on Tuesday night with my boyfriend and roommate and had AYCE. The restaurant looked clean and for a sushi joint it had really bright lighting. They have all you can drink Bud Light and House Sake Sunday through Wednesday which is nice. The rolls were pretty basic nothing really stood out, the sauces on the rolls were placed on the rolls kind of on the sloppy side. My Philadelphia Roll came with cucumber instead of avocado like they usually do. But the fish is extremely fresh!  Our waitress was nice but unfortunately never refilled my water. Everytime she would drop an order off at our table she would run off so fast that it was extremely difficult to continue ordering or ask for refills. Although it says that they have frequent buyer cards we were not offered one. I gave them 3 stars because their ingredients are good quality and maybe we came in on an off night. I would consider going back but I'm definitely going to scope out other sushi joints in the area.",

I must say I'm very happy I did so. Staff there always makes you feel welcome, and service is consistently very good. They have fresh nigiris and the all you can drink bud light and saki from Sun - We. I'm glad we decided to give this place another chance, they will see us more often in there now.  We were just so done with sushi WOW and how they sometimes treated us. Would rather spend my money somewhere where they appreciate us.",

A friend of ours told us to try Sushi Tachi and we've been going ever since.  We do the all you can eat and start off by ordering tuna, salmon, and yellow tail nigiri to see which fish is the best that day.  Typically two of the three are fresh and mouth watering.  We then continue ordering those and a few rolls which vary depending on our mood.  We always order the veggie tempura (which are amazing), gyoza, and calamari from the kitchen.  Put those orders in right away because they sometimes take awhile especially if they are busy.   If you are looking for authentic sushi, this is the place to go!  It's our go to sushi restaurant.",

It seemed like it was all the workers that night...  Just few things that happened with customer service during our last visit that I don't think we'll go back.   It's too bad cause they are close to our home but if we're going to drop close to a Bill at this place they need to be a little more excited & on top of their game with their service to their guests.    Sushi gave the extra star or I would have kept this at a 1 star.   Oh on side note: our son is 3.5yrs but he's big for his age. Looks like he can be 5. They use height to determine if they charge kids.  Needless to say he was slightly above height so they charged us. He barely eats... maybe few pieces of a roll & eats edamames. I tried to plea with them about that issue but they didn't bug.  Too bad. So many sushi places in town. Little more of a drive but worth us driving to feel comfortable & happy customers.   Show your guests you care & we'd consider coming back.",

The meal was fabulous - the appetizers (I love green oysters), the rolls, the sake - everything was worth every penny.  My new \"go to\" rolls - Ay chi chi (this roll has habanero sauce on it!) and any of the rolls w/ sliced lemon on them.  They do an incredibly thin slice of lemon - the slight hint of citrus really add something special that I haven't experienced at other sushi restaurants.  This is a bit out of the way for us, but again, we enjoyed the food so much we will definitely be back again...I'm not sure you can beat the value anywhere else in Vegas.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the service could have been a little more attentive.  All of the servers seem to share all of the tables - which I guess in theory is great, but in practice I think they lose track of what tables they've attended to and which ones they haven't.  We did have to flag them down a few times to fill waters, sakes, and order more rolls.",

I've never ventured into the ayce realm so I can't speak about that.  The special roll listed at the bar is always good and interesting. My favorite part is that this place let's you order half rolls, which is awesome for me. I get a bigger variety with less waste! The miso soup is nothing special, vegetable tempura is good. I love their steamed shrimp shumai. Delicious.  The service here is hit or miss. Some of the servers seem confused most of the time. I've had many items forgotten and wrong items brought.

We ordered more rolls and 2 orders of shrimp tempura. At 6:45 we saw a man who just sat down being served 2 orders of shrimp tempura. We asked our server about it (since clearly they were ours) and he claimed to remember us ordering them and offered to put in an order then. We decided to leave. We spent $66 and left hungry.

We got there disappointed and explained our situation and that the information on yelp was incorrect. They showed no sympathy at all to make an exception and honor the deal. It is also sad that I, the customer, has to inform the people that the address is incorrect.

They have nice lunch specials, and the All You Can Eat is a good time too for when you really feel like stuffing your face hard. :)  I wish they had a little more variety with their rolls, though. It feels like half the menu involved spicy tuna and there's only so much spicy tuna this girl can take.",

Their tuna, salmon, and yellow tail were all very fresh. We tried the 911 spicy tuna roll and it literally made us cry. Keep in mind, we're no whimps when it comes to spice. FYI, free all you can drink beer and sake on Mondays and Tuesdays with an AYCE purchase.  Make sure the waitress gets the order right, or else they bring you more food than you can eat ... which they will charge you for (they have a sign for that).",

Secondly, the food was disgusting! Skimpy rolls with nothing in them. My sushi was literally room temperature because it had been sitting on the counter for 25 minutes!!! I saw our server twice the entire meal, and both times, get this!!! BROUGHT US SOMEONE ELSE'S FOOD! I never saw half of the food that I ordered. I would have paid 62$ to take this whole experience back. Overall the worst experience for sushi I've ever had. I eat sushi 3-5 times a week and I doubt I will eat sushi again for a month. I'm completely disgusted. On my way out, excited to finally get my check, I noticed a HUGE chunk of hair covered in dust on the top of my booth... PUKE . Save yourselves from the worst experience of your life and avoid this place AT ALL COSTS!!!!! ( I wish yelp had negative stars ) PS yelp makes me give a star to post my review, like I said.... NEGATIVE",

    "text": "Horrible customer service! Me and my best friend decided to give this place a try since our usual sushi place had a 30 minute wait time. Big mistake next time I will wait the 30 minutes.  First the host/waiter had horrible customer service. He was not friendly at all. We still decided to stay and put our first order in off the all you can eat menu. We ordered 6 things. The first 3 arrived and we started to eat. We ordered a roll called the chubby boy. It was not supposed to be spicy or have spicy tuna in it, but it did. When we asked the waiter about it he was unsure so called 2 other gentlemen to the table to stand and stare at it. After about 5 minutes they came to the conclusion that it wasn't spicy tuna and said it was crab meat mixed in yum yum sauce (still doesn't explain the spice and that roll wasn't supposed to have crab meat either)  Next our original waiter pretty much abandoned us so now we had a new waiter. He asked us if we wanted to order more and we told him we were still waiting for our other 3 items, but also ordered 2 more rolls. He said okay left and was back with the 2 new rolls. At this point we had already waited 40 minutes. We again asked him where our other items were and this time he asked us what the items were. We told him and he says \"Oh we gave those to another table because I wasn't sure who they belonged to. Do you want me to put the order in again?\" We told him no we just wanted the check. 15 minutes pass and no check. Then our original waiter comes back and ask if we wanted to order more. We told him no we just want our check then he says \"do you want some ice cream\" so we tell him no again.  This was the worst service I have ever had not to mention they did nothing to rectify their acknowledged mistakes. I understand things happen but at least try to correct them.",

Plus they take your order and make it for you fresh . The only catch is you have one hour to eat everything you ordered .. Anything left over they will charge you for. Since we went in a group of two females that was a bit intimidating and the only reason I didn't give five stars. I understand the desire to not waste food but without a actual timer you're on the edge of your table the whole meal. It seems to me they may be a bit relaxed about it.  Our service was Awesome.. Our server was helpful and friendly but everyone working was really nice . A server named David really stood out. He was engaging and friendly and very happy to help!! He even gave me the kiddie chopstick helpers since I'm fail.   For the money spent we got tons of food from Tempura, Gyoza to Sushi rolls and even delicious green tea ice cream at the end. It was a really good time !",

I read in a lot of the reviews that the service was kinda slow so we ordered everything at once. 1.5 hours later we were still waiting for some of the rolls.   Waitress with short hair (she didn't have a nametag) was nice, but odd. Soy sauce on the table was empty the whole time we were there despite two requests.   Ordered the \"baked scallop shell\" twice because they forgot it the first time. What they brought me was almost comical...it was like they mixed up fake crab meat with the world's tiniest scallops and put it in a rammekin with mayo on top. When I bit into this hot mess the scallops were still frozen but the fake crab meat was hot. I almost tossed my cookies right there on the table.  It almost makes me wonder if the reason they didn't bring it out the first time i asked is because they were out of it so they tried to make something up. Here, feed this to the white girl....she won't know the difference!  Uni was completely melted and turning brown which tells me it is old.   Gross. Go somewhere else.",

The rules are the same as every where else as far as no left overs unless you would like to be charged no sharing unless the other person has AYCE as well. The time limit of 1 hour isn't the longest I've seen but it was enough for us. On to the food. There were rolls that were very delicious and then some that were not. I personally did not like their garlic ponzu sauce however their spicy mayo was the opposite. I overall enjoyed the visit and unlike a few places I have been I was happy to taste their fresh ingredients. Some places give you old shrimp tempura in the roll and it is obvious and decreases the taste value of the roll by a lot. Well 4 stars from me which is as good as you can get unless i loved every flavor and taste from my favorite rolls.",

The ocean roll,  sunset roll,  and the yellowtail mambo all are exactly the same,  yet the descriptions are all different.  The garlic ponzu tastes like soy sauce.  The deep fried Shrimp heads tasted of old frying oil.   This place is crowded, we waited for a spot at the bar.  I thought crowded restaurant meant that people really like it.  Maybe they like the all you can drink Bud Light.  I looked around the restaurant, and  everyone was Caucasian.    Anyway I noticed that all the rolls coming out looked exactly the same.   Why would anyone give this place anything higher than  2 stars?  Have they not had proper sushi before?  Does this place not know what sashimi is?  Has the world gone mad?",

Everything, from the nigiri to the hand rolls to the long rolls, were served with way too much rice.  And they specifically state on the menu that you'll be charged for any food leftover on your plate.  The Cajun albacore was so not edible that I hid the other nigiri piece in a napkin for fear of being charged for it.  The spicy scallop yum yum hand roll was not yummy at all and only had a few pieces of scallop tucked inside.  When I saw it, I thought they had mistakenly given me a California hand roll.  My dad really liked his tempura udon so we may go back for the non-sushi food items.",

    "text": "When I lived in Aliante for five years, this was my go to spot for AYCE. Every year I always came close to letting my frequent card for a free meal expire. So doing the gorilla math, I was averaging just under a visit per month at Sushi Tachi. This place always had me coming back for more. The occasion for my most recent visit was to have dinner with my family that lives on the north side of town.  We actually waited 30 minutes at 7:30 to be seated on a Wednesday night, so the place does get pretty busy. Ten minutes of the wait we were just waiting for the table to be bused. I would always recommend sitting at the sushi bar because the chefs are friendly and give you good service but since we had a party of five we wanted a table. We had an enjoyable visit once we were sat.  I had the AYCE of course and had no complaints except for the uni. It was on the brownish side. The value comes with the Bud Light and sake. I also always down a sake shooter and have an order of amaebi with every visit. One bonus is they have halibut which is not guaranteed to be found on every sushi menu.  A couple dinner boxes of chicken teriyaki were also ordered at the table and for around $11, you get your money's worth: miso soup, salad, chicken, full California roll, and large size order of tempura.  Although I don't come often enough to fill a frequent card anymore, Sushi Tachi still remains a reliable place to have AYCE.",

Maybe they speak no English?!?  and didn't even give us our sushi.   Waited around. Called another worker over and we asked him to give us our sushi that's 2 feet away. I guess he became our waiter. The hubby asked for ice cream. It never came. Had to ask again. Note-there was barely anybody there.  FOOD: Meh. Not as flavorful sushi as the ones I've had in San Diego. The 'finish-every-grain-of-rice-else-you're-buying-the-whole-roll' is quite intimidating. They try to get you full off their rice so you want to order more cause your full of rice!  The mussels and seared fish were good.   Mochi for dessert is awesome except you only get ONE even though it's an AYCE. Lame.   They lag and suck at customer service(waiters that is). Quality mediocre.  No thanks for $60 between us.",

Very tasty sushi, miso soup, cucumber salad & beer!!

I went with three friends from work, and we all ordered the AYCE lunch at $24.95 (dinner is $26.95, with only a few items available only at dinner).    The sushi itself was pretty good, despite the non-Asians behind the bar.  Its just sushi after all.  The fish seemed fresh, although the octopus was a little rubbery compared to a couple of other spots I've been to.  The rolls were rushed through and falling apart a little, but that wasn't a big deal at all.  A few of the specialty rolls were really good, including the Valentines roll.  Since we all bought the lunch special, we could all share, and good times were had.  The ginger was particularly good here too.  It was light yellow in color, and sweeter with a less pickled flavor.  I am not a big fan of ginger in general, but this ginger was really tasty.  The one thing that was offsetting was the abundance of signs explaining the rules of the all you can eat... rules like eating all of the rice or paying full price.  I didn't feel like the place was very hospitable when we sat down at first.  Even my friend said jokingly, \"Feels like a dictatorship in here.\"  That feeling changed though because the service was really nice.        Overall, while I would say there is better sushi in Vegas, the AYCE aspect scores this spot an easy 4 stars.  I would love to go back when I am in the mood for a quick, yet thorough stuffing of sushi!",

    "text": "One of my managers recommended this place and ever since I've been coming back. It's pretty cool that on certain days not only it's ayce but it's aycd bud light and sake. Compared to the other ayce sushi places here in Vegas, this is the best one so far. My favorite is the volcano roll because it reminds me of my favorite sushi back in California that I would always get called, \"lion king\". It's not the same but it's close enough. They don't have any sort of roll like that here in Vegas and when I describe them what it is they just tell me to get a baked salmon roll but it's really not it. But anyways, they also have ramen here but I wouldn't really recommend it. I mean it's alright nothing special. I honestly feel like the only good thing here is just in their ayce sushi. However, you don't need to just get an ayce you can just do individual rolls. Oh and another thing I like about this place imo is that they have half rolls you can order so you don't get overwhelmed with getting a bigger/normal rolls. Service here is really friendly.. Or at least most of the time. I would have to say my favorite one is the girl with really short hair in sort of a pixie cut or boyish cut (sorry I didn't catch your name). I enjoy her the most just because she's really nice and I don't know I just get good vibes from her and I also like the way she talks lol. But one time I came there's this other girl who took our orders and I felt like she was being rude and so monotoned and just straight up giving me attitude as if she hated her job or something. Such bad vibes she was giving me to the point it kinda got me irritated lol. Well I'm going off on a tangent.. Anyways I would still come here regardless every time I'm in the mood for sushi or need to get my sushi fix on (which is probably once every week or two).",

One of the benefits of eating here was the made-to-order, all you can eat sushi specials during lunch time. I wonder if they still have this going but if you were looking for a cheap sushi meal, then go no further. However, I've definitely had better sushi in my life before (I've been to Japan twice, and there is a great sushi bar in Kansas City, MO which is excellent.)",

I was craving sushi so I got the ayce and really wish I hadn't. The sushi wasn't fresh at all. The pieces were fairly small and tasteless. The rolls were really rice heavy with barely any fish in them. My boyfriend got a chicken teriyaki bowl and it was awful. He didn't even eat half of it. The service was not so great either. My cup sat empty for most my meal as the waitress just walked back and forth. On top of that they brought me out an extra plate stacked on top of dirty ones. So not impressed with this place.",

They do have an AYCE and its in line with most AYCE sushi. The sushi here is really honestly bad. I had the all you can eat here (for the last time) the other day. Every roll that they brought was warm (and not on purpose) the fish was disgusting. Even the edamame was gross! The service was also bad it literally took the server 20 minutes to come over and ask what we wanted to drink and then another 10 minutes to get our drinks and put our sushi orders in we waited over an hour to get any food at all! And when they brought our first couple of rolls half of them were not what we ordered! Then the lady argued that we did order it. Finally she took the food back and brought us what we wanted, which still tasted bad.  I think they've had a change of staff or something but regardless your employees should be properly trained. The two tables next to us also had issues with their food. I wish I could say anything good about this place but if I were you I'd stay away.",

If you're going to bash a sushi restaurant over their dessert menu, then take your a** over to Baskin-Robbins. You act like you're paying a lot for an all-you-can-eat joint, bud. I wonder if you know you'd be paying more if you ate a la carte at any other restaurant. You're lucky they serve dessert at all. Green tea ice cream is enough for me considering the amount of sushi I'm eating.   In any case, this place is still one of my go-to sushi spots and I'm glad every time I come in that the staff always remains so friendly.

I've been coming to Tachi for years since this place is close to home. The quality has declined over the years. We would normally do AYCE but they also have a regular menu to order from.  Miso Soup: This is not the version that's made with love.  The soup is pre-made and the tofu pieces are so tiny. 1/5  Sushi/Sashimi: Sashimi isn't included in AYCE. AYCE is about $24-26/person. Or you can get sushi/sashimi combo starting at $10. The quality of fish is inconsistent. Sometimes the fish looks like it was cut using a butter knife. Sometimes the fish is ice-cold. 2.5/5  Shumai: You can get these balls fried or steamed. Shumai is meant to be dipped in soy/ponzu sauce but they don't give you sauce here. 3/5  Donburi: Katsudon, raw egg on top of rice with hot broth. The hot broth cooks the raw egg so mix it all up as soon as the bowl touches your table. This is a good dish, however, when my sister ordered this the last time, it lacked flavor. They were not busy at all the last time we went so there's no excuse. Another inconsistency? 3/5  Since the location is convenient and sometimes we just don't want to drive 10 miles to get good AYCE, I guess we will continue to come here and keep hoping we catch them on a good day.",

    "text": "So this may sound a little exaggerated however it is not. We went out to eat at Sushi Tachi tonight and my husband went against his better judgement. We (daughter and I) love this restaurant and hubby just doesn't care for Sushi like we do so he planned to have something different. We were all happy.  When we arrive, the restaurant is full and there are several people waiting for tables. We decided we would sit at the bar because we have never sat at the bar before. Everything is going well and my daughter and I ordered our second roll and my hubby is eating his teriyaki chicken bowl. The Chef hands me my 2nd roll and my husband taps me on the arm and shows me a screw he had in his mouth after a bite of his food. It looked like a screw from the wok handle. So we call the waitress over and she takes the food away and gets her manager. Now my stomach is upset and I delayed starting on my roll. My daughter asked the chef for something else and he looked up at us and snot dripped from his nose down to the Sushi prep board where he was making rolls. I about died right there. My daughter and I looked at each other in shock and I said \"aw hell nah\" and stood up walked to the front and told the cashier we are not eating the sushi or paying for the food my husband didn't get to eat. Then I told him about the snotty chef. He apologized profusely and still charged me $35. I will never eat there again and it will be a loooooong time before I have sushi or food that others prepare for that matter.",

They have great Monday and Tuesday deals and a decent selection of rolls. All-you-can-eat is the way to go!   The only thing I don't like is once we were given lots of grief for bringing in a few chicken nuggets for my four-year-old (who doesn't like sushi or anything else the place offers). They almost didn't let us stay to eat! The next week - they had a sign up saying \"no outside food\". While I understand the rule, it's disappointing that I cant visit unless I don't have my kids with me.   Note to self: teach my kids to like sushi. Until then, I will not have many chances to visit Sushi Tachi! Beware parents - don't bring (outside) food for your kids in. They will turn you away. But if it's date night - I recommend this place!

He cut some gloriously thick slices for the Nigiri, Maguro, Salmon & Yellow tail! The food that comes out of the kitchen is all well prepared, and I recommend the tasty green mussels but I go for the sushi For an all-you-can-eat-in-under-an-hour kind of place, the fish is always fresh.  Chatting w/ Harold he asked me what I liked and how spicy I like my food & after 2 of the menu rolls he asked if he could make me something off the menu I told him cool do your thing. it was AMAZING!!!! He calls it a mother w/ child (salmon on the outside w/ salmon roe a delicately sliced lil piece of lemon) after that he was free to make me what he wanted and after that decision I have never had so many total melt-in-my-mouth moments. Considering the quality of Harold's work, the A.Y.C.E. hour is the way to go.   But be careful.  By the time I was ready to leave, I thought I was going to burst because i could not stop eating and when i finally did I remembered that rice expands in your stomach.......SO AGAIN BEWARE!!!  The only thing bad I can say about Sushi Tachi is don't go on Wed or Thurs (Harold's nights off)",

    "text": "I went here with my boyfriend after reading all the nice reviews here on Yelp. I didn't have high expectations, but I did expect some level of tasty sushi expectation. Wanting to satisfy our sushi cravings and for a close to home spot to eat it, we ventured out to this little place on a Friday night around 7pm. Unfortunately, yelpers totally missed the mark this time. Don't worry I still rely on and like you fellow yelpers.   Service was good. They were attentive for when my glass was  empty and refilled it quickly. Clean and spacious place. Even had a TV mounted on the wall. Normally I'm used to the loud, crowded, sometimes chaotic sushi joints where the bar is filled up and everyone's having a good time. Chopsticks clacking, glasses hitting the table lightly. It was really quiet for a spacious place with no real energy or atmosphere. Not too big a deal.  When I went, there were sports jerseys on the walls. The walls were largely empty save for the jersey decor, there wasn't exactly any charm to the place. A little silly, but again definitely not a big deal, after all, we were here for the food.   We were the only ones at the bar despite the fact that it did have other groups there at the tables. It was a little awkward sitting there with people staring at us and with murmurs of conversation.   The sushi didn't taste fresh. Exactly as how another reviewer said, this might be the \"fast food\" of sushi. It was okay. Dry. Bland taste. Not all that delicious. Had most of the rolls. Salmon, yellowtail, eel, California roll etc. In no way am I picky eater at all. Far from it! I'm not one of those sushi-purists that are finicky eaters who crave fine dining. Lol I'm not a sushi snob. Just a sushi lover and not too hard to please. But really, this place was mediocre even for an AYCE choice. Nothing to rave about, much less recommend.   I'm happy this place seems to  have a good following. I'm all for a  local business thriving especially for a sushi place you don't have to drive miles and miles for. Unfortunately, Sushi Tachi won't be my sushi paradise.",

    "text": "The continuous quest for decent sushi in the desert brought me here.  Located on the SE corner of Simmons and Centennial, the location is convenient for me, so I just had to try it.  Sushi Tachi has the standard tonkatsu, teriyaki, tempura, sushi, and udon.  They also have an AYCE menu, for $25.95 for 1 hour.  I am very skeptical of AYCE sushi, but surprisingly this place is a solid 3.5 stars!  The sumeshi was on the mushy side, maybe they put a little too much water in the rice cooker today.  But, the portions were surprisingly generous, especially for AYCE!  (I was expecting monsterous-sized nigiri, topped with a wafer-thin slice of fish.)  Our waitress was Thai and a little slow, but one of the Japanese waitresses took our second round order, when I jokingly said I wanted uni and amaebi (the limited sushi menu did not list these items), she asked the Japanese sushi chef if they had uni and amaebi, and he responded with a, \"Hai! Motteru!\" Wow. I asked if they had otoro, and the sushi chef said, \"mottenai\".  Too bad, I guess you can't win them all!  She then asked if we wanted the amaebi heads fried...I jokingly looked at her like, \"duh!\" and she laughed and wrote my order down LOL. Yay!  Now I knew I was going to get my money's worth!  This place is actually not bad for the price, much better than Sushi Wow on Simmons and Ann.  They do, however limit the uni, amaebi, sake shooter, and fried oyster to one order per customer.  (I guess that's fair, because people like me will just place an order for 20 Uni sushis LOL)  They also have a stamper card, so when you buy 10 AYCE meals, the 11th one is free!  I will definitely be coming back when I feel like pigging out!  Update 5/15: I have been going to Sushi Tachi pretty regularly, and this place still is a solid 3.5 stars in my book!  They didn't have Uni the last time I was there, but they had toro and kobe beef!  Yum!  Don't mind the cheezy 80's rock music they play there LOL!",

    "text": "I was a US Marine stationed in mainland Japan for 3 years. I swore if i ever went to a Japanese restaurant i'd either REALLY want it or it'd better be some of the best stuff ever.  This place...WOW  The size of the place is just perfect it's not too big but it's big enough to hold a good crowd, it's small enough to look crowded or semi crowded when it's not up to full capacity.   The pricing is very unique, you can either go by the cost of individual pieces or go for the 45min all u can eat set price for lunch or the 60min all u can eat set price for dinner. The price is okay considering that's how much a high end buffet costs anyway.  The thing that changed my opinion about this place is that the menu is very creative you can get standard stuff like every place has, i made the mistake of getting a California roll for a start before my buddy told me i can get anything i want because it's already paid for. HIGHLY recommend the Mahi Mahi...thingie...it's on the specialties part of the menu bottom left corner. The leaf they put on the roll makes biting into it so refreshing and the tartness of the sauce they drizzle over just ties everything together. Simply amazing  I give this place 5 stars because of the creativity of some of the things on the menu. There are things i didn't like and some faults i noticed  MAYONNAISE oh god i hate how the Japanese love squirting the stuff on everything. The baked muscle and scallop shell are just covered and baked in mayonnaise, completely killed the sweet natural seafood flavors of the muscle and scallop.   In conclusion i will be returning to this restaurant when ever I'm in the rare mood for sushi",

    "text": "I've been to this restaurant a few times now and it has been great each time.   They have an All You Can Eat (AYCE) menu available for lunch and dinner that is pretty great for the price.  The quality of the Nigiri is very good, with the fish large enough to cover both ends of the rice, which is something you don't expect with AYCE.  The menu also has a very large and elaborate selection of hand and specialty rolls.  The AYCE menu also has things like miso soup, chicken teriyaki, tempura, desert, etc...  all for $20 per person for lunch and ~$26 for dinner.  As others have mentioned there is a time limit listed for the AYCE menu, we actually asked the owner about this the first time we visited and he said it's just there to prevent abuse. I'd recommend the AYCE menu for groups who like sushi and want to try all the different nigiri and specialty rolls.  As others have mentioned they have some great lunch specials.  This place is definitely worth a visit if you want some quality sushi for a price that won't break the bank.",

It's really not that big of a deal but it was a little issue. Other than that the food was OK. Nothing spectacular but just a little better than average.

The AYCE menu has plenty of options and you can order things not on the menus for the chefs (like yellowtail belly) & if they have it on hand, they'll give it to you too. The AYCE dinner price also includes hot sake and budlignt on certain nights which is an awesome deal!   The service is always good and the sushi fresh (although I received some questionable uni once, but they took it back without issue). They provide AYCE stamp cards so you can work your way up to a free meal which is always nice too.",

It's just not much to look at, that's all.  \"All you can eat\" prices are fair--$26 for lunch and $29 for dinner and that includes all the Bud Light and sake you can drink. I've run up on the time limit and the staff was very polite by letting me know I'm getting close and they would take any additional orders I had cause they didn't want to charge me extra.

I had been here once for their lunch special, so I decided to give it a try for dinner.  The value for food is good, for $10.95 you get teriyaki chicken, shrimp/vegetable tempura, california roll, miso soup, rice, cucumber salad, green salad.  This isn't the best food, but probably the best in this area.  I left extremely full and satisfied.  This place was relatively packed on a Friday night, so I'm guessing it's the go to spot for a lot of AYCE fans up north.  I would definitely return here for cheap meal, especially with the limited options in Aliante.",

The garlic tuna nigiri, salmon nigiri and lisa lisa are a few of my top picks and I recommend you to try them. The calamari and shrimp tempura here is also pretty good. And the chocolate tempura ice cream here is one of my all time favorites. If you do ayce make sure you ask for a stamp card because the 11th one free! Also i noticed that the weekends always tend to be more busy, so if you're looking to avoid the wait i'd say go in during the week! aside from that 10/10 would recommend this place!",

So disappointing. Horrible service from the moment we walked in. The rolls were not as memorable or unique as before, the execution of the rolls was not as beautiful or out of the ordinary. Was embarrassed we brought our friends to this place because the service was so bad... and we drove up from the strip. The shadiest part of our experience was the server adding her 18% gratuity on the post tax total. Will never go back.",

Fish is fresh, well as fresh as you can get for being in the desert, and the service is good. Prices are on par with many other sushi spots around town. My kids like the food here and it's convient to the Aliante area so we usually go here. If you have a large party you can call and make a reservation so that you don't have to wait for a table.",

    "text": "We used to come here a bit when they first joined the neighborood. As th le family grew, we kinda stopped coming. I will say, however, I would still get something to-go a few times during each pregnancy for these specific items: mixed green salad, oh! Philly roll, and their vegetable tempura. DONE. Made the belly happy.  I always loved their Oh! Philly roll. It is basically a cut roll of seaweed and rice, with salmon and cream cheese in the middle, then tempura fried.   The dressing they use for the mixed green salad is something I wish I had a big tub of because I would gladly drench, scoop, dip, my salad into it without regret. I also love their vegetable tempura because the veggies aren't over nor undercooked. It is cooked perfectly to compliment the crunch to the tempura batter.  With all that said, that's all I can say about Sushi Tachi in recent times. Today, we decided, more like I decided...let's go to Sushi Tachi for their AYCE. The last couple.times we had gone for actual sushi, we always left disappointed in the overall quality of their sushi. But, I'm pretty fair. It has been awhile, we've never gone for their AYCE, let's indulge...annnnd it's nearby so why not.  Service, the waitress was great! There werent too many people in there. Perhaps because tis a Tuesday around 1pm. Perfect! Lots of seating, not noisy, the babies can continue their sleep in peace.   I noticed they had revamped the look of their menu, cool. Also, their AYCE is now 60 mins lunch or dinner.  I was excited to dig in, but when I started looking thru the menu, I instantly felt bored. I don't know why. Maybe twas the sushi gods giving me the forewarning.  Anyhow, I got the Hawaiian roll (spicy tuna inside, tuna on top with spicy mayo drizzled on top of that topper), oh! Philly, spicy tuna cut roll, salmon skin roll, garlic tuna, and a seared tuna.   The only two that didn't disappointment, just happened to be the two that have been fried in some way (oh!philly and salmon skin incase I lost you there). Safe to say. Most things fried are usually oh so badly good, cant really fail on that end. All the ones which truly mattered, just disappointing. Sadly, Sushi Tachi just drizzle happy their sushis. Even a simple tuna nigiri is masked by some soy sauce base concoction. There was nothing garlic <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fabout.my&s=0ea9d148140529845e0c94b23c104d64bde97a9dbed1e8e23144ee920d9d5caf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">about.my</a> garlic tuna, and certainly nothing seared about my seared tuna.   The only freshness about the tunas in my opinion, is that all my tuna dishes tasted like they came straight out of the fridge....Nothing like tasting the coldness to your fish. Literally, from fridge to cutting board. Don't like that. It's how I felt about my macaron experience. The Hawaiian roll was.unmemorable.   24.95 for an AYCE there literally made me say, man...I wish we went to Kaizen. Whaaaaa?!?! (In minion voice). I literally felt like I needed to change my Kaizen star rating after today's experience. I don't think they're worth 24.95 in my opinion. Sure you get some alcohol, but, I come for sushi. I got the alcohol, I got the sushi, but I also got disappointed with the overall quality and cleanliness may I add.  I have to give them 3 stars from the 3 items I love from here, and the service from our waitress. So, we will only return for my pregnancy craves minus the pregnant part. Officially done coming here for sushi.we were done along time ago...but this was the grand finale.   Definitely kid and stroller friendly (just don't bring in those side-by-side kind of strollers). Don't know if the buckles to their high chairs work as we didn't need it today.",

They serve AYCE and all you can drink beer and Sake but the alcohol is only Sunday- Thursday.   The Poke is delicious and very fresh.   The service was good but a bit slow as we had a party of 16. The servers were very patient and friendly.  Food came out and everyone was happy.   The location is a bit of a drive from the strip bit well worth the visit.   Fortunately my friends were staying at the Santa Fe so it wasn't even a ten minute drive.   Parking is easy to find so I'd probably return here again if back in Vegas.   Next time ill drop in on a Sunday to enjoy the beer and sake.   If you really want to enjoy this place, be sure to come with a small party.   That way you can order what you want and get it quickly as there is a time limit on the AYCE.",

    "text": "Shame on you Sushi Tachi for charging my 68 lb 10 year old the same price you charged me for AYCE sushi. Nevermind the fact that $24.95 for lunch is by far the highest priced AYCE in the valley, how can you legitimately charge children prices based on their height? My 10 year old is tall for her age but she's very thin and eats like a bird. My 8 year old out-weighs her by 7 lbs. Unfortunately the pricing wasn't the only issue with our lunch here this past Sunday. For starters the service was sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooww. By slow I mean we ordered 4 rolls as soon as we sat down and didn't get one of the rolls til literally 45 minutes later. We ordered 2 volcano rolls (the kids love them), the waiter held up 2 fingers and verified we wanted 2 volcano rolls, yet we received a Volcano Roll #2 which is practically nothing like the regular volcano roll and has cooked salmon on the inside and outside. Some rolls we had to order twice because they simply never came. This is unacceptable service for a $25 pp meal. They seriously need to hire more people, 2 servers and 2 sushi chefs is clearly not enough for the small crowd on a Sunday afternoon. I overheard one server apologizing to the table beside us when we walked in so I'm sure we weren't the only disgruntled patrons. Good bye Sushi Tachi!",

    "text": "More of a 2.5 in my opinion. Just got home from this restaurant. Ate during lunch time.  The two waiters i had were very nice and helpful when i asked questions. It was my first time eating there. I decided to go with my brother since the place is near my house. We got AYCE sushi. The inside looked really nice and clean.  The lunch was $24.95 (45 mins) Dinner is $26.95 (60 mins)  I really didn't like their price for the lunch and their time limit. There are so many other places that have their AYCE lunch cheaper and with 60 mins, not 45 mins :P  The sushi was good though. Fish tasted fresh enough for my taste. Their baked sushi's tasted really good also. Since i'm a HUGE baked muscle fanatic, i tried their's and it was only \"bleh, ok.\" I was realy disappointed at that.  My brother ordered his last roll and he had to wait for a long time because the chief's didn't make it for some reason. So he asked our waiter what happened and she went to go make sure that he got it as soon as possible. So we were glad at how nice and apologentic they were.   For dessert, they only offer the normal ice cream for lunch. Therefore, the mochi and tempura ice cream is only for dinner. I was disappointed about that as well :P  ~Overall: the place was \"ok.\" Great service.  Good food, but definitely had better with a cheaper price. Horibble price for lunch, considering the time limit all the things that are not available.",

The sushi is always great and the staff is super friendly.  The service is excellent.  Their rolls are excellent and they give you a good portion on the Nigiri sushi.  If you do the all you can eat meal be sure to order some of the hot items from the kitchen - my favorites are tempura, shumai, calamari, fired oyster, edamame, and gyoza.  The lunch specials are filling an all under $10.  Update:  Service has gone downhill.  Fish is not as fresh as it once was.

If I were the kind of person who'd consider panda express to have the best Chinese food or olive garden to have the best Italian food then I'd prolly consider this place to have the best sushi.  That's the only way I can describe it.  It's like the panda express of sushi.   We didn't get the AYCE cuz, well, we don't do AYCE sushi.  Tried to order some nigiri but they didn't have any really good types of fish.  Just the standards: tuna, salmon, yellowtail.  So ordered a couple of rolls with various fish selections.   Nothing was remarkable and the salmon was slimy.  the service was all but non-existent. we sat at the sushi bar and were ignored by all 4 sushi chefs which would be forgivable if the bar was full but there was only 1 other customer there. 4 chefs to 3 people. hm.  it seems as though they have quite a loyal following which is fantastic for them and i hope that those patrons continue to be just that, loyal.",

It was really good and perfect for me since I'm pregnant and can't/won't eat real sushi. I then ordered the dinner special which is like a bento box. This is my review of the items in that dinner special:  miso soup - pretty good but a little saltier than I'm used to salad w/ house dressing - it was ok  teriyaki chicken - I did not like this white rice - average shrimp/vegetable tempura - pretty good california roll - delicious and it comes with 8 huge pieces  My husband and I also ordered the tempura fried chocolate ice cream which was delicious. I also have to rave about the price. My dinner special was only $10 and my 1/2 roll was around $4. These are great prices and I was beyond stuffed when we left!! I'll definitely go back!",

    "text": "Came back again to celebrate V-Day because we had such a good experience the first time we came. This time was a total disappointment. First off was the service they have signs all over putting a 60 minute time limit on the all you can eat. We waited 20 minutes just to order apperizers. Finally were served because the busser asked how we were. In all honesty she (the busser) had the best service in the place. Several things we ordered were forgotten and we had to ask where they were and were told they were still being cooked. (sure they were) As if the service wasn't a bad enough experience the sushi itself was nothing special.  I really wanted to tell management because this experience was not worth the $100 we are about to spend, but my husband does not like to cause any problems. We will just never be back. Please save yourself an expensive poor experience and go somewhere else.",

    "text": "Every time my sister comes to visit, we hit up a AYCE sushi joint. Last monday, this was the spot. It was $26.95 which comes w/bud light and the house sake for 60 mins.   Here is what we had:  3 buds and 2 large sakes spicy tuna hand roll w/masago and a quail egg (me only) 2 orders of ahi poke 1 order of raw tofu 2 orders of salmon and 2 orders hamachi 2 orders of amaebi w/deep fried heads 1/2 of a roll that i forget the name 1 sake shooter (me only) 2 baked scallops 1 salmon collar 1 order of the cajun albacore and 1 order of tako 1/2 roll of new york girl in vegas 1 green tea ice cream 1 pink colored ice cream which i forget the flavor  The food was very good. The fish was fresh. Our sushi chef was the older japanese man. He was great. The waitresses were nice. The place was clean. I'll probably come by myself next time I'm craving sushi when my sister isn't in town. We came here for an early dinner so I was disappointed that I wasn't able to eat more. Great AYCE spot hidden in North Las Vegas.  My sister's one complaint was that the bar stools were too low. Yeah they were a little low.",

    "text": "It's Friday night, and I was craving some sushi but I didn't feel like driving all the way to Yama for some nommy sushi.  I then decided that I was going to try something new since it's been awhile I tried a new sushi joint. I did some research on here nearest to the house and this place came up first. (for all you stalkers, yes I live in North Las Vegas).  Gives you an idea how much I love YAMA.. 20 miles away and been there over 30 times!!! I think I got Duchess status on there =P Anywho, back to my point..   So this place is located on the corner of Centennial parkway and Simmons, right across from Fresh and Easy, Southeast corner of simmons where the Starbucks is at.  The AYCE sushi is $26.95pp. Which I thought a bit pricey for something I am trying new. I was thinking of going down the street to Sage Sushi for couple bucks less, but i went here for the adventure with my daughter. So we get there at about 1010pm. The YELP ad says, they close at 1130 so I thought, \"Cool, we got time\".. Soon as we sat down, server asked us for our drinks and the sushi bar chef asked for my order. 19 minutes later, tells me that I have 1 more minute to order,mind you I only have ordered the following: Spicy Tuna roll, and rainbow roll, edamame. I asked why he's giving me \"last call\" he said that he has to close his section by 1030. I told him I just got there! So he told me order more, so I just picked random ones I dont normally order, a lasagna roll, cream cheese based baked roll with scallops and ahi poke.. tuna salad..   How was it? None of the fishes (tuna) used in my rolls smelled or tasted fresh.. It was \"fishy\" and fish isn't supposed to smell and taste \"fishy\" if it's FRESH.. so yeah, it was gross... I had to wash down my food with red bean ice cream and diet coke!!! And i never drink soda at an AYCE joint, I usually drink water with lemon.. but that was too harsh, the lemon brought out the staleness of the fish even more when I went ahead and chased my stale sushi fish with water..YUK  Verdict.. $62 later, plus 20% tip (because i just do 20% as rule of thumb) I was out of there by merely 11pm.. total of 45mins, $75 less in my pocket, and not very happy... since It  had left a funny taste in my mouth.. LITERALLY! I Aint never gonna come back!! psshhhhh!!  This is what I get for cheating on YAMA.. (I love you YAMA)",

They offer all you can eat sushi and beer when you get the beer it's room temperature and the waiter doesn't care. After waiting 10 mins I asked where my other order was and he says ok and walked away and wondered around for another 15 mins avoiding my table instead of asking where my order was and letting my know what's going on. Then when you ask for a manager they tell you they don't really have one but the owner will be there in an hour and there's no one in charge I was extremely upset with the service with this place and the staff didn't care enough to apologize or ever try to make it right.",

The waiter ( forgot his name, sorry ) was wonderful, always with a smile and always making sure we were doing ok, very polite and always asking if we needed anything else plus he laughed at my brothers jokes (that's definitely a plus).

The sushi chefs know him the moment he walks through the door and remember his order every time for all you can eat. They have amazing service and so personalized.   I don't like sushi because I don't like raw fish. However, their menu has a lot of options for cooked rolls and you even have the option to order a half a roll. This is great for me! I order the rock n roll, jj roll, and lisa lisa and I love them! Each filled with different things like tempura shrimp, crab, cream cheese, asparagus, etc. The cooked mussels are my favorite so flavorful and fresh! They also have plenty of options from the kitchen such as edamame, calamari, teriyaki chicken, etc.   The pricing is reasonable, $26 for lunch or $29 for dinner. The restaurant is tiny and is somewhat hidden next to an EOS Gym but it is very popular. There is one large table you can fit up to about 20 but the remaining tables seat about 4 people. I highly suggest stopping in for AYCE!",

It was busy so we put our names down on the list. Sadly there were two chairs to be considered the waiting area and there was already a group of people so we had to wait outside in order not to get in the way of the entrance. The hostess barely looked us in the eye. I understand being busy but she could've taken a minute to compose herself.  We were seated after 20 minutes and the service was fairly quick. They took our drink orders and check in after 10 minutes to see if we were ready to order. I got the salmon dinner. It had Salmon filet with teriyaki sauce, 8 pieces of California roll, vegetable tempura, shrimp tempura, salad, and rice. The portions were big but there are some critiques I could give. The salmon was a bit dry, the seaweed on the California roll made it more chewy than one would want and the salad barely had any dressing. But other than those critiques the service was good and the food wasn't bad.",

    "text": "Been coming here for about 4 years steadily. But the past 2 visits has been trash. Starting off with service. Please inform your staff that carrying drinks against your body is just disgusting. Young server has done every time in my last 2 visits and it's just gross. Specially when the cup is against his armpit. Secondly I shouldnt  have to ask for ginger and wasabi at my table and if I do at least bring it. Last nights visit I asked 2 different servers and nothing. And finally down to the food, oh boy last night was the worst ever. The tempura crumbs on my sushi was stale and tasted old. I cant be the only one thought it. And certainly hope I'm not the only to mention it in the reviews. Most of of the rolls were dry and just didnt have some of the ingredients that it has in the past, not sure if it was a new cook or something but my last 2 visits have been a horrible experience. Service sucks and now the food is tasting to take a hit. I will be back one last time in hope that they change it up, if not I will sadly end this 4 to 5 years relationship. At the end of the day theres a sushi spot in just about every other corner and one of the reasons I came here was for their service and distance from home. But if the food sucks and service sucks I will gladly make the drive to other places.",

    "text": "I've been a regular here for years now and with good reason. The fish is always fresh and of high quality, as are all of the other ingredients. Even the sushi rice is on point in terms of taste and texture. My favorite rolls are the vegetarian roll, the New York Girl in Vegas sans cream cheese and light mayo and the Gone With the Wind has crispy salmon skin (which I love). Hand rolls and nigiri are also fantastic- I love the tuna, salmon, red snapper and uni... Although you really can't go wrong with anything you choose. Sunday through Wednesday is also all you can drink Bud Light and House sake with regular AYCE sushi. It's been 5+ years since my first trip here. I've tried other places around the valley, but this is it for me on the Northside!   PRO TIP: The 911 roll is actually extremely hot; they are not over-exaggerating!   PRO TIP 2: ALWAYS TRY THE EVER-CHANGING MONTHLY SPECIAL!   PRO TIP 3: Don't forget to grab a stamp card if you're a first timer- I promise, you will be back. And if you forget yours, they will start you a new one and combine it with the other.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "I love sushi and have tried many different sushi places but decided to give this place a shot, WORST mistake. I was really disappointed with not only the quality but the plating. I do believe people overhype this place a little too much or have just never tried GOOD sushi before. I usually don't post how bad the food is I just don't bother to go again, but not only was I upset at the food but the fact that I tried to beat it on time for lunch which still costs more than some better sushi spots on the strip which is 24.95 for lunch. First of all, the rolls had too much rice! The fish was unevenly cut, the rolls had no sauce nor garnishes that made it taste bland and look boring. The nigiri was the worst! The fish was too thick and chewy and had no flavor. I ordered the calamari and definitely was not what I expected. It was like three shrimp tempura looking things with terrible batter mix they used, they were not even crunchy but soggy. It made me not want to try any fried rolls since I'd probably lose my appetite even more. They didn't offer a variety of sushi bar sides but they did have a good variety of appetizers which my friend did enjoy since he doesn't like fish. Lastly, the dessert was only a choice of green tea ice cream or cookies and cream. For the price and quality I was paying I was definitely expecting something better like their special desserts which is only for dinner but should be offered all the time since better sushi spots like yama, gorilla, or goyeman have a better variety and quality for better or same price. Moral of the story, if it's gonna be your first time trying sushi, pick a different spot so you're not disappointed and never want to eat sushi again",

But on this visit, I was the sushi master!! Everything from tuna to soft shell crab, salmon to eel, and even a bit of yellowtail. I swear the menu had about 100 different sushi items to choose from and I've probably made it through 20 so I'll be back to claim my crown and throne from this sushi warrior challooonge (challenge)!  To get the bang for ya buck, you have to go for the All You Can Eat sushi deal for $24.99. That includes unlimited sushi and bud light or sake. Let's just say we indulged ourselves into pure bliss. Baked salmon hand wraps, spicy tuna tempura rolls, and deep fried eel rolls are <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>! The only downer about this place is that its small. The sushi bar area can sit maybe 10 people and the dinning area is decent. The tv's stay on ESPN but no.volume just closed caption.  The only way to enjoy this review to its perfect extent is to put on those lose jeans/gym shorts, prepare your appetite, and get your fanny down to Sushi Tachi and get your grub on! Lol.",

Portion size was just right. The chicken teriyaki wasn't dry but the flavor was somewhat bland. The miso soup was somewhat bland as well.  One thing that I was taken aback on was the rips and tears in the seat cushion at the booth I was seated in. It didn't help with the presentation of the restaurant. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant due to the worn furniture made this restaurant a borderline causal/divey place to me. This is not a place I would take a date to. Pricing for their entrees were reasonable. So if you are hungry and you don't care about the looks of a restaurant, this place would be suitable for a quick lunch.   Service was fine and they were able to serve the combination box to me in a timely manner. So the wait time to serve you food was quick. If you are short on time, you may want to try this place.    Parking at this restaurant is very easy. It is in a strip mall with ample parking. If I were short on time, and just wanted to eat something that was average, then you should give this place a try. But if you want to impress a date, you should look elsewhere.",

    "text": "I ventured all the way up here from Henderson to meet a friend for dinner. The restaurant is on the small side (but about average for a sushi place) and doesn't have the best decor. The booths are ripped and worn and there isn't really any unifying decor theme to speak of.   They offer both a la carte and AYCE options (AYCE is $27 per person for 60 minutes). We ate glutton-style. The menu is huge and the waitstaff definitely doesn't give you enough time to look over the whole thing before they're standing over you, ready for your order. You are able to order more than one item at a time, which is nice. The sushi bar is quick, while the kitchen is a bit on the slow side.   The sushi was fine. The fish was good-quality, but none of the rolls I sampled really wowed me. They are a bit rice-heavy and every single roll has sauce, which can be dangerous. None of the flavors really melded or set each other off in a delicious way. This restaurant seems to be an excellent example of doing a lot not that well, rather than doing a little bit extremely well. I think if they pared the menu down by half (seriously, it's that huge) and created a handful of well thought-out, complementary rolls, the experience would be much more enjoyable.  Food to dollars ratio: unimpressive, might be worth it if you're in the neighborhood.",

The salmon was fine. The hamachi was good. The eel tasted old. The snow crab (did you mean no crab?) was mostly Panko (Bread crumbs) and WAS NOT nigiri, it was a poorly wrapped Gunkan roll. It was just so off in execution I was really put off. The fish was not fresh. I did get a couple rolls and they were okay. They didn't overdo it on the rice ratio which is a common tactic but I just really was disappointed in general and frankly if I get sick I'm not going to be all that shocked.",

To me food is visual, especially sushi so in my mind, it didn't taste as great as it once did when they payed attention to details.   I still love all their little small plates that come with the AYCE menu; especially the poke salad, seaweed salad, gyoza, shumai, fried oysters, shrimp tempura.   I really hope that it was just a bad day the last time I was here and not the standard of what this place has come to these days. It'll take me a while to make it back there to find out.",

MOST of the workers here are very nice and professional. There is one taller server guy who always looks pissed off when he's serving food. He's short-tempered and rude. Don't you dare ask him to confirm what roll he just set down because he'll look at you like you're dumb. Idk his name but he's the only reason this review lost a star.  Oh yeah, back to the amazing things about this place. They do AYCE stamp cards. We filled our card and got a BOGO. This should tell you how much I frequent this restaurant.",

The service has always been consistently good; I would rate it 8/10. The chefs are nice and friendly. The lunch specials here are affordable. The sushi quality is good compared to the cost. I hate it when people complain about quality if it is cheap. People have to run a business and make money. I am always aware of that fact. Overall, this place is a great little sushi restaurant near Aliante. The ama ebi is always fresh here. Don't forget the fried shrimp heads! The sashimi dinner plate is what I always order. Just the right amount of sashimi. I don't really order rolls just nigiri on all you can eat.   Great place for the local area. I highly recommend this place.",

This used to be our favorite spot since it was the only good sushi restaurant in the neighborhood. Now 10 years later we still go here, but the menus and everything is exactly the same. After 10 years you would think they would update something. That is the reason I'm giving 3 stars. I wish they had some different options like the rest of sushi places around, more sides, rice less rolls, more dessert options, and more options without seafood in it. It would help with people with seafood allergies like my daughter. Other than that, this place has pretty good staff and is clean with a very low menu option.",

I've been to this restaurant multiple times over the past 5 years since I was first introduced to it and I feel like this establishment has gotten better. My particular dining experience with the staff on Saturday, 5/24/19 was so great that I wanted to write a review about them. Everyone was very attentive and friendly. My fiance and I came in at about 6pm and were seated right away. Since we already know our usual orders, our waitress took our drink and food orders pretty quickly. We didn't have to wait too long until our food started coming out. Their fried shumai and fried gyoza are 2 of my favorite appetizers. I also really enjoyed the Gone With the Wind roll because I love salmon/salmon skin. Throughout our dinner, multiple people were checking on us and refilling my water. Even though all their tables were occupied at the time, it's nice to see that they had an adequate number of staff to check and cater to their customers. Yeah, Sushi Tachi isn't the most fancy or nicest looking sushi restaurant in town, but it's a north side gem that has been here for a while and one that I hope will stay for much longer.",

    "text": "This is a quaint all you can eat sushi restaurant in North Las Vegas. They have football jerseys displayed on the walls and very fast service once you order your food. During the 3 times I came here, the servers didn't refill my empty water glass until I asked them. Even if it may say there is a time limit on the all you can eat option, I was never rushed. Furthermore, they will not charge you for a few pieces of leftover sushi if you eat most of the food you order. There is a punch card similar to most boba places. If you get 10 all you can eat order stamps, then you get 1 free all you can eat dinner.  As pictured, I have tried a lot of dishes from Sushi Tachi. Some dishes are a hit or miss, and unfortunately, the quality of the seafood depends on how old it is when you are served the sushi. Also, some items on the all you can eat menu have limits on how much you can order e.g. there is a limit of 2 uni nigiri and 2 amaebi nigiri per person.  The seaweed salad is a little vinegary. Do not order anything with imitation crab because those dishes aren't worth the money e.g. I got a scallop hand roll. There was barely any scallop, it was mostly dry imitation crab, yum yum sauce, and a bunch of rice.  I ordered fried salmon collar, and the 1st time I dined in, they gave me a different body part. The 2nd time I dined in, they gave me fleshy, fatty salmon collar. The fried oysters had a soft inner texture and buttery crisp exterior. The shrimp heads (which you have to ask them to fry if you order amaebi nigiri) were delicious and tasted better than their tempura! Tempura was just okay. The raw tofu was soft and had freshly grated ginger and chopped green onion sprinkled on top. The agadashi tofu was one of my favorites here too.  As for the nigiri, some of it was flavorful with good texture, but some fish tasted old. The albacore tuna already had soy sauce and a hint of sourness. The salmon was also soft, but had a slightly chewy consistency. The seared tuna had hints of pepper with green onion, but was nothing like fresh tuna in Japan. The seared salmon tasted sour and smoky. The amaebi (sweet raw shrimp) was nasty. A bitter, slimy aftertaste filled my mouth and made me gag. Thankfully, the eel nigiri wasn't slimy (that amaebi was slimier than even the worst eel nigiri I've eaten). The uni tasted pretty bad too, so don't get that.  Overall, Sushi Tachi is fast in delivering all you can eat orders but slow in refilling drinks. The quality of the sushi and cooked food is half good/half bad. I am gonna try to find better sushi places in the area.",

    "text": "Not a Sushi guy so this review is focused on service, and the interior cleanliness/feel.  I went to Sushi Tachi around 930pm on a Saturday. It was relatively empty. Though it was empty the staff seemed overwhelmed and stressed.  It took an awkwardly long time to have our order taken as our waitress paced by multiple times doing something at the register, or she would roll the dish cart around grabbing dishes. I don't care nor should I give in because you happen to be under staffed for whatever reason. It's not me as the customer that is supposed to be your friend out of nowhere and to have some kind of understanding as to why your service sucks.  If you want to be a legit restaurant then please straighten out your service. I should not come in and give into whatever it is that is wrong your business.      Second the Pork, and Chicken Cutllet's were tiny and not very filling!! The curry sauce was on point and the rice was good.      Third, this place was dirty and the interior is beyond it's life time of use, the booths look to be a 50's diner theme, the window blinds were out of position, wall color is odd, and yes the football jerseys are cool but way out of place,   If you have made tons of profit then it's time to renovate, your customers deserve it.     Make that cutlet larger and I might come back. Keep in mind Zen's Curry House will be opening soon on Centennial.",

First, I want to say I've been coming here for at least 5 year.  They are close to home and they have a great deal with AYCE sushi, you also have free beer or sake from Sunday-Thursday.  This is my favorite sushi spot close to home with quality fish.  I've recently gone to another AYCE sushi place near my sister's house that she frequents when it snowed here recently.  We got fish and uni that was old, browning in color and smelly.  I can't believe they served it.  She had been raving about this place for years.  I told her it was awful and she needed to come to my neighborhood and go to SUSHI TACHI.  Everyone that I have brought have always raved about the quality fish and seafood!!  In addition, they have since become frequent visitors as well.   SUSHI TACHI IS AWESOME!  Thank you Sushi Tachi for the great food, service, and sake!!!  Wishing you many years of success and staying in our neighborhood!   Btw... I am not related or connected to the owners or employees of this store.  This is an honest review of my opinion based on my experiences at this establishment!!",

I guess it a fine place if you live up in the area but nothing really to come out of your way for.  Mostly stuff you will see anywhere else and amazingly.  desserts are served with dinner only unless you want to pay extra for a dish of ice cream or one mochi.  We will go to our other places that do it right.",

    "text": "Been eating at Sushi Tach since the last review in 2012 and recently they have replace the menu's that I notice some reviewers were complaining about well used dirty menu's. Me I never had a problem with the menu being dirty but to put your mind at ease I noticed they have replaced them with new ones. As always AYCE was wonderful. clean facility and friendly staff. I tried the Sake Shooter and OMG I had 2 of them. Ahe Poke is out of this world. Oh and if there is something you don't want, like light on the sauce just ask. When trying a Roll, order a half roll and if you like it order a whole one. Ask and Ye Shall receive, stay silent and get average menu items. everything is as advertised but communication as with anything will make your meal much better. If you want a 911 and tell the chef you want it hotter he will make your toes curl up, be careful what you ask for you might get it :)",

Nothing really compares to Sushi Tachi in quality, presentation, and value.  As a sushi lover for 25 years, in addition to freshness and cleanliness, I look for simplicity.  Many sushi restaurants now mask their sushi (especially rolls) by using too much sauce on top or bottom of the rolls.    If you want simple, good nigiri sushi, this is still the best sushi place in the north/northwest part of Las Vegas.  All you can eat deal, which includes pretty much everything they make in the restaurant, is hard to beat.",

The fried oysters were not fresh, you could tell they were mass produced and came frozen. The shrimp tempura was delicious.The service was lacking. I did not get a refill on my drink, with all the rice I was very thirsty. My daughter was sick to her stomach for a couple hours after.

Ate here twice already, once with just my boyfriend & I then the second time with his whole family. Both occasions were different servers & both were not attentive, nice or friendly.

I was also unimpressed that they only offer frequent buyers club stamps to customers purchasing their all-you-can-eat option. I paid twice as much, and they wouldn't even offer one stamp. Four stars for food. Two stars for pleasing the customer. Sadly, that makes it a 3.",

To be honest, the fish didn't taste as fresh as it should.  I was underwhelmed by the quality, and the speed of service definitely left something to be desired.  We were seated at 5pm, decided on AYCE, and we weren't served our first roll until 530!  On top of that, we had to pester the waitress to even get our place settings.  Because we didn't get the wasabi, ginger, and soy sauce until after the first roll was brought out, we didn't actually start eating until 545.  Luckily, they were lax on their 60 minute time limit, otherwise, we may have only eaten two rolls between all four of us.  Unless the service and quality see a marked change, I most likely won't be frequenting this place.",

All of us ordered all you can eat, a total of 6.  We asked for a seperate check my husband and I.  After our meal, they charged us 18% gratuity because we came in all together.  I complained about it because we did ask for seperate checks in the beginning.  Then the waitress said \" but I didn't charge you for your daugther\"...Oh that got me upset because her including the gratuity on my tab shouldn't have to justify my daughter not being charged.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cheap person, I would've tipped but for her to include my daughter in the situation was wrong.  I felt like they weren't trying to resolve the situation but only make it worst.  I replied back by saying \"go ahead charge my daughter then\"....They changed the bill & charged me for my daughter $7.95.  I looked at the kid's menu and it was the most expensive item on there.  My daughter ate 2 sushi's & green tee ice cream.  I've eaten at other sushi restaurants and NOT ONE OF THEM charged me for my 2 year old daughter.  Very disappointed!!!!

For some reason, we weren't feeling much love from the staff, even though we were the only ones seated at the theretofore empty counter/bar and the tables were only half filled.  Believe me, we're definitely not a bunch of jerks that might elicit such a reception, which maybe means we tend to be a bit too sensitive about such things as attentive, friendly service.  But it's also a bit ironic that the all-Japanese staff should also know that they wouldn't be forgiven for such shabby service, say, in Tokyo.  The young sushi chef who was serving us for some reason seemed to be in an especially unpleasant mood--almost as if he was doing us a big favor by taking our orders (Itamaesan no taido wa mazukatta!).  Nonetheless, the sushi itself was not half bad.  Perhaps for many people food quality mitigates poor service but I have to question whether it was worth driving up to the edge of nowhere for such a chilly reception, especially when you've already traveled 2,800 miles to Vegas from Honolulu!  A bit disappointing as this was our second visit with more or less the same group and we had been looking forward to dining there based on our initial, more positive experience at the restaurant.",

My family and I went to Sushi Tachi a few months ago and it has taken me this long to calm the rage from the experience to write my review.  One evening my husband,  daughter and I went out to AYCE at Sushi Tachi. We walked in, sat down and began ordering. My daughter had brought in a Disney Princess doll to keep her occupied. Dinner went on and we were getting odd service from one of the waitresses. My husband and I simply thought she was just a naturally unhappy person and that is simply \"how her face always looked.\"  The odd unhappy waitress came over at one point and asked my daughter to see her doll. The waitress said, \"that is a pretty doll, is it Cinderella? .\" My daughter corrected her and said, \"no it is Sophia the First.\" The waitresses response, \"oh, well she is white just like every Disney Princess.\" She then walked away from the table. My husband and I looked at each other in shock. We finally arrived at dessert. I ordered green tea ice cream and my husband ordered a tempura vanilla ice cream. When the waitress brought our order she gave me my green tea ice cream and as she placed my husband's order down she said and I quote, \"here is your vanilla, vanilla.\" My husband a little confused asked her what she said. The odd, unhappy, smug waitress repeated, \"here is your vanilla, VANILLA!\"  Well, as you can imagine we will never be back.",

    "text": "It's not the best sushi place, but for North Las Vegas, it's pretty good. You can't check in using your iphone yelp, because the address it maps is way off base. It's actually located on the corner of Centennial and Simmons/Aliante. If we didn't live in Aliante, we probably wouldn't make a special trip to come here. There was a sign that they will have all you can eat and drink (bud light and sake) starting in May, which is a big draw for my husband.  The menu has a good variety and I'm able to get udon for my daughter while my husband and I enjoy the all you can eat sushi. The hamachi collar and amaebi are really good. I loved the Salmon Skin hand roll too. The uni was gross, but that's what's expected from all you can eat places I guess. The service was fine and they seemed to keep a good pace even though it was pretty busy. We went about 6:30pm and it was packed, but at 7:30pm, it was dead.",

This place offers AYCE at strip prices but not at strip quality. I came with friends on a Friday night, my second visit only because a friend likes their half orders. I was leary because of the slooooooooow service before but decided it could deserve another chance. BAD IDEA!!!  It was very busy and the wait was long. Once seated the waiter was attentive and suggested we place an order straight away, after looking at the full restaurant we decided it was a good suggestion. We should have researched and placed our entire order for the night because it took over an hour to get half an order in and received!! They had very few staff which makes no sense on a busy Friday night! Half our table was already eating dessert by the time the other half of the table had received their main sushi course! Our party had to leave and I had to leave with them even though I didn't get my order at all. AYCE here not worth another visit and the food quality is not worth the money.",

    "text": "Sushi Tachi is a great place, they are my favorite place not only for sushi, but my favorite restaurant in general. They are also a great value $26 for all you can eat for dinner plus $2 for a drink including refills, I always eat a ton, their sushi is delicious.  I've been to other sushi places that have similar offers around Las Vegas, but their sushi isn't as good as the sushi you get at Sushi Tachi. Something else I would add is that when you're in a group you can share only if you all order all you can eat.   When I arrived at the parking lot I heard Katy Perry playing, they have speakers that play music outside of their restaurant, I found this welcoming. At the front I was greeted and quickly seated with a party I was meeting, a waiter asked me for my drink and brought it to me very quickly. A waitress then took my order, I started off with Uni, I found it pleasing, it tastes a bit like oyster, but pasty instead of slimy in case you've never had it before. After I ate my Uni, I ordered the Lisa Lisa roll, it has hot tempura shrimp next to cream cheese on the inside which warms it up, which is then complimented with the cold, sticky, sweet sushi rice on the outside, dip it in soy sauce to add that extra salty element that dances on your taste buds. I also tried something new, I didn't know what it was at first, a friend of mine ordered it. It turns out it was the New York Girl in Vegas, it was amazing. As I chewed into it, I felt the sticky, the firm salmon, the creamy avocado and the creamy and spicy mayo. I swallowed and something hit me, something citrusy, I was caught off guard, it adds a lot of bright notes to the roll, I loved it and will order it next time I go.  I love this place overall, one complaint would be that I wish the waitress would walk by more often so that we could order more food, the food can also take a while to all come out, but it's worth the wait. I strongly recommend checking this place out if you haven't. Try the Lisa Lisa roll, the Tachi #2, a lot of my friends favorite, and the New York Girl you'll love them.",

The Kassandra roll is a particular highlight if you enjoy yellowtail, and if you like a nice seafood medley I recommend the Sunrise roll. The all-you-can-drink hot sake or Bud Light (Sunday - Wednesday) is a perfect counterpoint to the fish.   Service is generally quick, though if the house is full you may experience a brief wait for your first set of rolls. Our server Jamie was attentive, polite, and pleasant.

Furthermore, it has always been ready by the time they have promised, even on the busiest of nights and weekends.  My only gripe is that we usually bring our kids.  Last summer we brought our 3 year old who can obviously barely finish two pieces of sushi if he's really hungry.  We told our server that he was 3 and usually just grazes off of our plate.  She said they had a rule where he had to be a certain height against one of their counters.  I cringed because my son is in size 5 clothes and is always mistaken for being much older, but you can tell by his language that he is definitely not that age.  Well, he of course measured higher than the counter.  I offered to show his birth certificate that I had coincidentally had on hand after registering him for school and they said it didn't matter, they had to do a height test.  So bizarre lol!  So we paid for him to eat a two piece of the sashimi.  Didn't seem right at all, but we have still continued to order.",

Most of the nigiri was good, but there were some cuts that were boring and slightly stale, and others that were completely falling apart! Some of the cuts were so thin that they were literally ripping apart off the rice without me touching it! Maybe it is a newer chef, or maybe they need to sharpen their knives....Pic : <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-tachi-north-las-vegas?select=oMnMM29bSkwcsK7hv_PCPQ#oMnMM29bSkwcsK7hv_PCPQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sush...</a>  I didn't even take a pic of the Unagi because I was embarrassed for them...presentation wise, and the flavor and consistency was not there. I would say it was the worst Unagi I've had, and I am fairly easy to please.  Not all of it was bad though.  The salmon rolls and sake nigiri tasted good, as well as a few other cuts of fish.  But nothing really stood out or made a statement.

We came in and were sat in a comfortable booth.  The ambience isn't awesome.  It definitely doesn't give you a cool vibe, but is a standard restaurant feel.  We had the AYCE option on the dinner menu that is $26.95 per person.  The appetizers are all really good and come in super small portions so that you are able to order several.  All of the rolls that we tried were great.  I recommend the Volcano #2 roll and the Black Jack roll.  We also saw that you could order sake shooters.  BEWARE--these are actually a shot with sake, quail eggs and orange fish eggs.  I was not able to eat it.  I guess I should have asked what this was, but it doesn't specify on the  menu.  Overall a pretty good place.  You only have a 60 minute time limit at dinner with AYCE and I was worried the whole time about being rushed.  The waiters didn't seem to push us, but I did see that they noted our arrival time on our receipt.  I think it is a decent place to grab some sushi.",

Most all you can eat places ensure to keep coming back knowing you want to keep ordering as you go. But I waited forever to get refills and order! I was more annoyed than anything. Our server kept going to the hostess stand to talk to the employees... While I'm waiting! Too bad this place has great food but not worth the customer service.",

    "text": "Friendly staff. Service was good (sushi bar and from the wait staff). Brightly lit and spacious dining area.  Good food, great AYCE value if you take advantage of the unlimited Bud Lite and House sake promo.  And the ability to order just about all the rolls in 1/2 portion size.  I ended up at Tachi because I was turned away by the overwhelming response to Sushi Mon's 10year anniversary promotion (Maryland Pkwy location) and was in the vacinity running some errands.  When I arrived at 5:15pm, the place was still fairly empty, but was close to 75% capacity when I left at 6:30pm.  The restaurant definitely has a good following in the NW.  The food was good, I enjoyed most of the items I ordered (san the Spider Roll I ordered at the end, which I thought was bland and the sushi rice didn't taste right - maybe it was a new batch or the end of one).  Anyway, here is my review of the items I also ordered: * Fried Calamari appetizer from the kitchen was excellent.  Just dried perfectly, with a light batter coating.  * N.Y. Girl In Vegas Roll - Pretty good, I enjoyed it overall, but would have like less mayo on it. * Dragon Roll - good stuff,great if you like eel. * One More Time Roll - Pretty good, but would be super if the mango used was more tasty and ripe (but we know mangos are not in season in the fall/winter). * Uni/Ikura/Garlic Tuna and all the nigiri I ordered were all good.  Very satisfied!  I skipped the dessert due to time constraint, but the restaurant offers the usual ice cream (green tea, red bean and plum) and during dinner one order of mochi ice cream (mango, strawberry or vanilla).  Price:  $24.95 (45 minutes) 11:30AM - 4:00PM $26.95 (60 minutes) 4:00PM - 10:30PM  Misc comments: 1. The chair at the sushi bar is maybe 6 inches too low.  It felt awkward sitting there at first, but the padding on the chair was comfortable. 2. Waitresses were on top of refills, I didn't have to ask for hot tea once and the used plates were cleared quickly. 3. The young Japanese waitress is cute. 4. There are off menu items (specialty rolls) that you can order, but the names and images of it are hanging as pictures on the back wall.  You can totally miss it, if you are seated in the wrong part of the restaurant. 5. Anthony, the Mexican Sushi Chef, was great.  Made the rolls quickly and profeciently.  Location:  NW Las Vegas. Perfect for those living in the Aliante area.  Service:  4.5/5  No complaints here.  Food: 4/5  The fish are fresh.  Good selection overall.  No daily specials like at some other sushi bars (not a negative, just pointing out a fact).  Price:  3/5  In line with other AYCE sushi bars in Las Vegas.  Parking:  3/5  In the same strip mall with a gym, parking wasn't a problem for me, but it was pretty full when I left.  I would definitely go back if I am in the area.",

That wasn't the case.  We walked in and we're immediately greeted pleasantly. The girl had us seated quickly, it was quiet and slow with baseball on the TV behind the bar. She took our drinks and we signed up for AYCE. While waiting for our food, glancing around, the decorations are nice, it's pretty casual, seats aren't uncomfortable, and it's got a nice set up. Cosy but not cramped.   Boyfriend has devoured so much food. Nothing was bad. Although, I should have been more careful with my dairy intake. =P silly me.   The other waitress girl was super pleasant and very chatty with us. Boyfriend likes to chat, so that was a plus.   They weren't too pressuring about a time limit, possibly because it wasn't busy.",

I won't give up on this place it has so much potential i'll give it another go. Also if it's convenient i recommend sitting at the bar there is this sushi chef there who is simply just delightful to talk with if you are by yourself and he will take care of you, because of him this place gets 4 stars instead of 3",

A gem that has strayed from the inner city and traveled along to make it's own way into our hearts... err, stomachs that is! ;) I can speak for many sushi lovers out there that love and enjoy the comforts and different tastes that a lot of sushi bars and restaurants offer to their patrons.  A comfortable and home-like setting provides the city and part of Aliante a place to make their own and enjoy great eats without the rage and rush of middle aged adults. Sometimes, a quiet place is in order to enjoy great company and conversation. And upon reading that semi-theatre-esque introduction, Sushi Tachi is that hidden gem in Aliante.  The menu is pretty similar to the Sushimon chain, but what really makes this place stick out is their outstanding service and polite manners. 3 stars for the similar menus to Sushimon but location and service give Sishi Tachi a generous!  Baked green mussels and cajun albacore nigiri FTW! Happy eating :)",

We always get the AYCE and then a separate dinner for our youngest son.  One night he was feeling a little \"sad\" that he was not eating a roll, and they took some chicken katsu, carrot, cucumber and rice and rolled it up in soy paper for him.  Now, that is service! Unless we are in a larger group than 4, we always sit at the bar. Don't forget when you are there, to ask your chef what HIS specialty is!",

We actually went around lunch and dinner time (got there at 3:45 dinner starts at 4).  They gave us the option to do AYCE lunch $23.95 or dinner $26.95.  I wanted to do dinner so I could order Uni but we opted for lunch and I'm so glad we did.  Since it was our first time there I wanted to scope it out and see how fresh their fish were.  Not so fresh!  I thought the nigiri was below average... the rice was undercooked and the fish smelled fishy and was cut horribly.  For example, the salmon nigiri we ordered was huge but not in a good way.  The texture of it was like biting into flesh or something, yuck.  It was definitely not melt in your mouth sushi.    The rolls were alright (then again the fish is smothered with sauce but we could still taste a little fishiness).  They made a roll for us they didn't have on the menu which was nice of them.  Poke was alright, although they gave only a few chunks of Ahi and lots of onion (I'm assuming it is Ahi).  The only rolls I enjoyed were the avocado roll and natto roll.  My husband wants to go back for their all you can drink night, I'm not sure if I will be joining him.  If I do I will be ordering ala carte (avocado and natto roll).",

They give you 60 minutes to order whatever you want on their AYCE sushi menu, which is almost everything.  They don't really time you though.  My cousin and I were there for over an hour and no one said a word  He even told me that he and his family were there once for over three hours and they kept on serving them.  Sunday-Thursday are also all-you-can-drink Bud Light and sake nights included in the $26.95 price.  The fish is very good quality and they don't skimp on the amount of fish in the nigiri or the rolls, which is awesome.  The sushi chefs and waiters are friendly although a little slow.  It's a good thing that they're not sticklers on the 60-minute time limit.  I'm definitely hitting this place up again during my next visit.

After sitting down we noticed the other sushi rolls that were being served, they didnt look all that delicious, so we decided to play it safe and order two half rolls to see if we even would like it. We ordered the 911 roll, which made us both want to call 911. Was SPICY as advertised but presentation was horrible, the roll looked more like a square and was squished at the ends. WTH? The only thing that stood out about that roll was that it set our mouth on fire. Nothing else signficant about it, was not \"tasty\" at all. I should have just took a shot of Siracha hot sauce instead. We also ordered one of the Tachi rolls. It was okay. Better than the 911 roll, it had some taste. Lastly we ordered garlic tuna sushi...which was missing the key ingredient...the GARLIC sauce! It had just a minute drizzle on each piece. FAIL. We ended up leaving and going to our regular sushi spot.   That staff however was very polite, quick service, and all smiles.   Lesson learned, the grass was not greener on the other side for us.

    "text": "10-4-2013 1700 (5pm) Friday 8 people in the restaurant. Was placed at a table and immediately noticed the table was filthy, look around and others in the same shape. Not dishes, food residue on the table. Ask busboy to clean uses a very wet cloth a couple of swipes and leaves the table wet. Mad because he had to do his job. Ordered Calamari fish was not cooked. Ordered sashimi dinner salmon was very old tried to cover it up with lemon slices. While I was eating the chef started some fish in the salamander about two minutes, then was told wrong order so he pulled out laid it on the back counter. A little later chef put it back in salamander and served it to someone else. There is food on walls, food on chairs, fish not stored at proper temperatures. Pre made starters wrapped in Saran Wrap about ten out in the open on the back of counter. I was up half the night with bowl problems.  The worst thing about this experience, I have been going there since it opened. This OWNER takes, but doesn't put anything back into the business. It is very popular, but someone is going to get very sick. City and county FOOD inspectors  need to come inspect now.",

It is also a very clean restuarant. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect score was because the bathroom is in a odd area of the resturant. You have to actually walk into the kitchen to reach the restroom. Other than that, it is awesome!",

    "text": "Well, several months ago my rating would have been much higher, but the last time we went, the service was much slower and the sushi not as good.  We do like the AYCE days, and we take advantage of it.  Even with slow service, it is worth it, because we EAT SUSHI - a lot of it, and everything on their menu, even the $15 special rolls are included with the AYCE.  We usually go on the days when it includes wine or beer, and it is definitely worth the price.  We are traditionalists and therefore don't usually eat the Americanized cream cheese and avocado stuffed rolls, and it's harder to ruin the standard fish and rice sushi.  But some of the rolls being served are gorgeous.  All the cooked things I have had, yakitori, hamachi kama, etc. have been very good!  I have to say that every time we have been there, the fish has been fresh, but the care going into it and the little touches (like making it pretty) just haven't been there.  They don't use wasabi in their sushi either, which is strange.  I guess I could ask them to do, but we just put it into our soy sauce and dip the sushi in it.  Needless to say, we will be going back.",

We went on a Saturday and therefore they didn't have their all you can drink, which if you drink seems like an excellent value.  Now the sushi is very mediocre in my opinion.  Would probably go back one more time to try the all you can eat and drink special.  Hopefully the sushi is better.  I think that you don't get the same portion for an all u can eat vs a regular a la carte portion?  I don't think this place merits 4.5 stars though for sure!!  3 seems right, 4 is pushing it.....",

The friendly staff were still there and they had different chefs but i felt like they were going slow on purpose. I ordered side dishes and two of them were forgotten and the other arrived 20 minutes later. I used to love this place but it was just blahh. The quality of the fish is still one of the freshest i just dont feel its the same experience anymore and im saddened. Maybe it was just a slow lazy dayyyy.",

We always opt to do AYCE, so I can't really say much about the a la carte menu, except that you, obviously, probably get more bang for your buck with AYCE. We like to get the usual favs, seaweed salad, miso soup, green mussels, and shrimp tempura (always hot, fresh, and crispy). They have a monthly special roll as well, which is nice if you're wanting to venture off the usual fare. If you're not sure about a particular roll, you can order half a roll to lessen any waste. Service is nice and friendly and is always ready to take orders. If it's a busy night and you have a large group, do expect to wait because this restaurant isn't that huge. If you become a fan of this place, they have a stamp card for every time you do AYCE. If you happen to come in for AYCE lunch, there are a few selections on the AYCE dinner menu that aren't available during lunchtime, but you can do the AYCE dinner menu for a few dollars more. Like to have beer or sake with your sushi? Well, Bud Light and sake are included with AYCE from Sunday through Wednesday. You're welcome.",

The one thing that I didn't love was that I found the service kind of sloppy... although we did arrive just after a dinner rush on a Friday night, so I'll give them that.  Just to note, I'm not a local N. Las Vegas-er, I'm originally for Toronto and now live in NYC, so I'm also a bit spoiled when it comes to Japanese.  We were on vacation, staying in the area, so we decided to check it out based on Yelp reviews.  I would 100% go back and recommend it others looking for decent Japanese in N. Las Vegas.",

Greatly appreciated: Sushi Tachi gives you the choice of soy paper wrappers instead of seaweed for sushi.
