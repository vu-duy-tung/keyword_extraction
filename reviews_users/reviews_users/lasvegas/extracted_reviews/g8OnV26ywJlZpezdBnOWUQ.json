    "text": "I recently moved just down the street from what will certainly kill me, Hash House a Go Go. I say kill me because it is very likely I will eat here 2-3 times a day until I literally explode. It's really good. But if I could Tarantino this review and skip backwards in time...  Chapter 1: The terrible Advice When I first moved to Vegas in a discussion about food two people who's opinions I value warned me against going to Hash House. Its overrated they said, the food is really bad they said, chicken and waffles is gross they said. Like an IDIOT I listened to them and didnt go to Hash House until my 4th year living here.  Chapter 2: The house that hash built  Once I moved to Sahara I thought to myself, \"Self, what if they are wrong? What if Hash House is as good as yelpers say? I mean, my friends are idiots, I don't know why I listen to them about anything...\". So I decided to try it on a Saturday afternoon. When I walked in the place was packed and I was told at least a 20 minute wait. We were seated in about 5 minutes which is good because after a mere 5 minutes I was ready to murder several customers to eat the food I had seen recently delivered to them.   Chapter 3: That's a big flapjack A lot of the reviews discuss portion size, and I'll admit the portions are bonkers- I am a warm blooded American who doesn't quit anything from war to to tee ball games where I'm down 20 runs, but even I had to tap out after eating only 5lbs of my 10lb flapjack. The side of potatoes went largely untouched. All in all I felt a great deal of post eating shame at how much food I had left over, maybe that's just cause I was raised Catholic.  I will say I found it a bit preposterous that when they delivered this 20 inch in diameter flapjack that they gave me approx 1/2 a tea spoon of butter and like 4 ml of syrup. After explaining to the waitress that I was a human man and would be requiring more they brought 2 more little cups... Come on Hash House get it together- the only people who eat pancakes without drowning them in syrup are masochists and the criminally insane. A pancake isn't even really a food- its just a utensil designed to ferry butter and syrup from the plate into my gullet.   Chapter 4: The Menu  This was tough. There were at least 10 things i wanted to immediately order but having seen the size of the portions I knew getting 10 entrees would be a tad excessive. This will require future visits to try everything and answer some philosophical questions like what is the difference between a hash and a scramble? How much can I eat before I die like that guy in Seven? How drunk can I get at 10AM on a Tuesday?",

I got the hash with roasted rosemary chicken.  I asked the waitress what type of chicken it came with since I only eat breast meat and she said it was all breast.  Well I got the food and it was mostly breast but there were quite a few pieces of thigh in there.  Not a huge deal as it is too much food anyway but the chicken was so dry that I needed a drink of water after each bite.  Who cares if the portions are big if the food sucks?  I won't be going back there again.",

They are all super friendly and will work to make sure you are taken care of.    My eggs were delicious, the fruit fresh and sweet and the potatoes (non-hash) were just okay.  My daughter had the bacon waffle and ended up picking the bacon out of the sides.  She said the waffle itself was just a little too thick for her.  My mom had the normal breakfast plate (scram eggs, toast, potatoes & bacon), my aunt had the bacon scramble and I had the spinach/ham scramble.  I can see what other reviewers mean when they mention that the food is just okay.  The flavor doesnt knock you out of your seat but it is still a fun place to enjoy a meal.   The best part of the meal was our fabulous waitress, Tiffany who should be delievering her son any day now.  Too cute!",

    "text": "This is a review for breakfast.  The Skinny: extreme portion sizes but hit-or-miss execution (3) service: not bad however we usually get there when it opens to beat the rush (3) value: pricing is a little pricy however you will for sure have leftovers unless you order 1 entree/2 people (3).  We come here for breakfast whenever we feel like a) we can get here early enough to beat the rush, b) we have to take the car in for service, c) we feel like pigging out in the morning.  By far, the best dish here is Andy's Fried Chicken Eggs Benny. It sounds kinda gross - fried chicken, bacon, mashed potatoes, biscuit and gravy - but it's kind of a guilty pleasure. It's a total heart attack on a plate but very flavourful - sweet, crunchy, buttery goodness.  Their biscuits are great with their homemade strawberry jam. Delish.  Now for the bad news.  The pancakes here aren't bad either however their batter lacks the mild crispiness likely due to their size. Blueberry pecan is better than Blackberry granola in IMHO.   French toast is okay but a little too sweet.  Their chicken 'n waffles were not that good - the waffles were too saturated in syrup and were soggy. The chicken was fine though.  You need to bring a crew with you when you come here to eat because of the large portion sizes. I would suggest ordering maybe 1 entree per 2 people and then order the minimum amount for the second (such as a biscuit with butter). Seriously - one entree will keep you nibbling for at least 2 days.  Overall, some good stuff, some not so good stuff. 3 star review.",

    "text": "Wow what the hell happened here?  It's been a long time since I've been to this spot (well before we moved to Vegas) but man, the difference between then and now was night and day.  I'll start by saying the bulk of this one star review is for the service, which was abominable.  Right after our food was dropped off, our waiter buzzed by  to see if we needed anything and that was it.  We didn't need anything at the time, but half way through our meal my wife and I would have both liked a drink refill and my wife wanted some butter or jam for her biscuit, which the restaurant offered up dry.  Despite several efforts to flag this guy (or anyone else) down, we were ignored.  He finally popped over once we were well done and had been waiting for the check for about 10 minutes, and asked \"do you need anything.\" I said \"just the check at this point\" and, seeing I was pissed, he didn't even bother to ask how everything was.   So how WAS the food? Well my wife had a salmon scramble, which was just ok.  It was supposed to have brie cheese in it, but she was given one extremely tiny blob of brie and that was it.  The rest was eggs and fish.  It came with the aforementioned dry biscuit (seriously who serves a dry biscuit when there is no gravy or sauce and provides no butter or jam) and some terrible home fry style potatoes (our waiter's recommendation for the best potatoes on offer).  I had the pounded pork sandwich with salad.  The salad was middling, with just about past its prime veggies and an overly sweet cucumber dressing.  The pork sandwich was good though, I've liked it in the past and liked it here. I also had the Hash House Bloody Mary, which was disgusting. Easily the worst bloody mary I've ever had. The bloody mary you get on an airplane, with the from-a-can spicy tomato juice and little bottle of booze is far superior.   Overall, this was a terrible experience.  I doubt we'll ever be back.  I'm not sure what happened here - we liked this place a lot on our first few visits - but ugh.",

In fact, when we cant afford a hotel room during a turn around trip we order one of these and camp out under the potatoes for warmth and sustenance.  We came here on a long road trip to Sundance/Slamdance film festival and piled into the booth with a caravan full of hungry crew members. Not a single meal was finished, and no that wasn't a lack of valiant effort. I actually shared my plate of food with 6 people and there were still left overs. The potatoes were creamy, the fried chicken was crisp, the sauce was decadent, the biscuit may have been the lightest part.   Was it an experience everyone should have? Absolutely.  Will I order it again?? Probably not in this lifetime.  We have been back for the incredible pancakes, specifically the brown sugar banana, which requires no accoutrements and is freaking amazing about two hours later when you're on the road in the middle of nowhere.",

We had 7 of our 8 person party and they still made us wait for an hour and a half even though there were tables open.  I was patient with this until we overheard a comment from the hostess that indicated she was making us wait longer on purpose. At this point we waited so long we were not going to get up and start all over and we actually wanted to try the amazing looking food.  4 of our orders were wrong. I  personally had asked for no onions and had onions cooked in and liberally used as a garnish.  When I asked the waiter about it she looked at me blankly and said \"what would you like me to do?\" Um.. Apologize, fix it, get manager involved.... Something. We felt like they had a vendetta against us and we were not unruly in any way.  I cannot remember if the food was good.",

The food is delicious, and not too expensive, but not \"Hash House\" priced either.  In fact, hash house is redolent of greasy spoons and truck stop diners, but the prices and quantity here are outside that measure..    If I could recommend anything, fried chicken and waffles is AWESOME and if you just pop in and get dessert, sharing the bread pudding with a friend is heaven.

    "text": "So, consider this My Big Fat First Official Las Vegas Yelp Review since moving here to Sin City.  My partner, Bear, strongly recommended this place after having lunch here with his cousin, who's a 'local'.  And I can see why...HHAGG takes their \"twisted farm-fresh\" sensibility really seriously, all the way down to the rust-covered \"Green Acres\"-era tractor perched out front near the parking lot.   But all else you could notice about the place - even the Wall of Fame at the entrance, that contains the autographed photos of dozens of celebrity past-diners - falls away once the food takes front-and-center stage.  It is no surprise that MAN VS. FOOD's Adam Richman considers this one of his all-time favorite places to eat.  The portions are HUGE.  And I mean so big, even ravenous farmhands just in from a full day in the fields might have to step off a bit.   Our friendly, animated waiter warned us away from having individual side orders of fries with our sandwiches, having us opt instead to share just one order between us. WISE call.  The Stuffed One-Pound Burger that I had (with the incredible applewood- smoked bacon and melted cheddar), was cooked to perfection, but more like a TWO-pounder than just a single.  And I was HUNGRY.  If you are gorge-a-phobic, I would strongly suggest that you bring a friend, order one entree and split it.  Uhh, actually, you might even want to make it a couple of friends....  The amazing thing here, though, is that the food doesn't sacrifice the quality for the quantity, which is nothing short of amazing. I do plan on coming back and trying more of the scrumptious-looking items on the menu...just probably not until Thanksgiving!",

    "text": "Our party of 6 finally got our act together to grab brunch around 1:30pm on Saturday (though I suppose by then it was actually lunch ;) We waited patiently for 30 minutes as our empty stomachs growled from an early dinner and light night the evening prior. By the time we were seated we were ravenous. Everything on the menu looked good.   When we walked in we eyed the other patron's dishes, unless you're competing in Man vs. Food, those portions are not for regular human consumption. We opted to order 3 dishes to share. Instead of paying the $2 per plate surcharge you're allowed to add on a side to waive the fee - might as well get something if you have to pay anyway! We opted for sides of fruit, scrambled eggs, and bacon.   We wanted to diversify our selections so we ordered: the sundried tomato, basil & goat cheese Farm Scramble which is served with potatoes and a biscuit (this was the vegetarian selection for me which included all of my favorite ingredients!), some bacon stuffed waffle thing topped with sage fried chicken, and finally, a farmed benedict.  I can only speak to the sundried tomato, basil & goat cheese farm scramble since the others had meat in them - the scramble was delicious!!  The portion size was smaller than the other dishes we ordered but still plenty to share. The service here was good, we were inhaling the food just 15 minutes after we ordered it and had our waters refilled frequently.   Bottom line, Hash House A Go Go is definitely worth the trip from the strip, just be sure to bring a big appetite along with you and be prepared for at least a 30 minute wait at all times of the day!",

I've only been successful with that one time.  Every time I call someone picks up right away, but then when I say I need to place an order for carry out I'm put on hold for at least 7 minutes.  That's the quickest that anyone has ever picked up to take my order.  All other times I've waited as long as 12 minutes before I disconnect and try again (doesn't matter if I'm trying to order breakfast or lunch - and I try to call at \"non peak\" times).  Every time I end up calling back a second time I ask whomever answers first not to be kept on hold so long to place my order.   If I walk in to place a \"to go\" order (which is usually just a lunch salad) I wait a minimum of 20 minutes for my order.  That seems like a long time to wait for a salad - and I always tell them that I need it sort of quickly because I have to get back to work.  Food is decent, but overpriced anyway, so I will no longer be doing business with this location.",

I got the Andy's sage fried chicken salad and it was just spectacular. Words really can't describe it honestly. My husband got the fried chicken benedict and he was just as amazed. Not only was our chicken cooked to crispy perfection, the portion sizes are ginormous! Making the price of the food super affordable.  The wait staff? All of them make sure you're comfortable and your drinks get about halfway and BAM! They're there to refill quickly. This place is just perfection, we're going to come back one more time before we leave!",

Visiting here wasn't my pick. But it wasn't nearly as bad as reviews here led me to expect.  20 minute wait for lunch on a Saturday around 11AM, pretty standard. We were seated at a cocktail table in the bar area and I really liked our server- Kelli?, lady with spiky hair and friendly, casual demeanor like a female Guy Fieri.  BF ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles, and highly suggested that I order the Kokomo meatloaf sandwich- so I did, with the house salad for the side instead of fries.  Portions for both are enormous and we could have easily shared just one dish, but wanted to try more than one dish. And now my guy has dinner to take with him to work tonight, so it all works out. $30 and change before tip.  Fried chicken and waffles- chicken is actually pretty moist and flavorful, waffles weren't bad but also weren't my thing. Accents of fried leeks and some roasted peppers made this better than I expected. Didn't go overboard with the maple syrup. Meatloaf sandwich is hefty- ate about a third of it and had my fill of the flavors. Liked the tomato sauce, felt the mozzarella taste was masked by stronger flavors but the texture broke up the meat and bread a bit. Heavy and rich, even if you're hungry, split it.  Ultimately, my careful picking at each dish and my hungry guy eating what he wanted (damn his metabolism!) only made half of each meal disappear. While many reviews here indicate that the kitchen is more focused on quantity than quality, the flavors weren't bad but given the gigantic portions, easily get redundant.  Best to come with a group and share a few dishes.",

Seasoning and taste of the chicken was good--breaded and fried well, moist chicken breast. ***My only CON is I wish the waffles were a cooked longer/made a little crispier. I'll have to ask for that if there's a next time.   O had the kid's Bacon Waffle which was bigger than her head--they use a 4-square waffle iron!  She only finished one square which is probably a typical kid size serving. She started \"digging for gold\"=bacon when I stopped her. Hahaha!    H had the kid's Griddled Meatloaf served with mashed potatoes. The meatloaf obviously was precooked and just fried up on the grill to get it warm on the inside and crisp on the outside. It was very dense and average tasting, she claims my meatloaf tastes better.  The mashed potatoes were seasoned well and had good flavor. Not just a starchy scoop of potatoes.   Talk about ginormous portions--Leftovers galore to take home for lunch or a snack!",

They also seem to love cramming giant branches of rosemary in everything, just to add height to the plate. The food itself is average at that. I tried a breakfast scramble and a stuffed cheeseburger. Both lacked seasoning and really didn't stand out with me or my partner.   Don't get me wrong, it is a fun experience to go with friends. Service is fun and usually pretty good. Drinks are poured strong and are as ridiculous as their plates of food. At the Hash House..bigger is better I guess.",

    "text": "I've been to this location twice. Both times exceeded my expectations. I've learned the quickest way to get a seat, is to go to the bar. I probably shouldn't tell you that secret, but it's not like I go there everyday so, I'm fine with that.   Anyway, I had a scramble the first time I was there. Their breakfast potatoes (crispy) are great. The eggs are the usual and I had sausage and spinach in my scramble. While I was eating I noticed this monstrosity of goodness going by me twice. I decided the next time I go here, I will eat this.   It turns out, it was the dish that was featured on the Man Vs. Food show. It's the Andy's sage fried chicken benedict with fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs This thing is monstrous. I, being a big dude, was able to finish it all because my friend challenged me to do so (prick). I was also hungover and wanted something to soak up all the booze from the night before.   This thing was tasty and took quite a bit to eat. The only thing I would change, and which I will ask of next time I get this, is to have it with the crispy potatoes. I love mashed potatoes, but for breakfast I prefer the crunchy hash potato browns.  The service was great. The bartender was very attentive. She got everything out quick, made a damn good iced coffee, and I didn't have to worry about going empty.   Another cool thing, I saw Dee Snider, lead singer of Twisted Sister, at the restaurant. Nice guy. Didn't bother him for a picture, but I did shake his hand.   Overall, very good restaurant. Definitely a fan. The only reason I gave one star is because it could be pricey. Breakfast shouldn't be that expensive, but then again, the portions are HUGGGGGEEEEE.",

The portions are huge, the prices are high, and the quality is mediocre  I've tried a few different dishes here, for breakfast and dinner.  For the dinner dishes we've had the pot pie, which is an interesting twist on the norm. It can best be described as a soup poured over mashed potatoes with the crust on top.  The meatloaf with pasta is served with linguine pasta.  When I tried to order with speghetti pasta instead of linguine pasta, I was told by the bartender (our server) that the chef doesn't like to do special orders. Seriously?  Throw a different style of noodle in the boiling water and make your customer happy, it's not difficult. As for the flavor, I didn't care for it.  The burgers are huge and can be ordered stuffed. Again, they are huge portions. But the meat was greasy and didn't sit well in the stomach.   As for the bar, they can make a mean BLT Bloody Mary. It's a 5/5 star drink served with bacon, lettuce, tomato, bacon, a slice of crunchy bread, and a packet of mayo.  Occasionally we will come for the drinks at HH, but go elsewhere for food later in the evening.",

    "text": "Ohhh Hash House, this place is a must-stop every time I'm in Vegas. I wish they had locations closer to me, I would go ALL THE TIME! They have a good variety of food and HUGE portions. Seriously, do not underestimate their portion sizes! One of my friends and I shared one of the meals here and not only were we both stuffed, but we also had enough leftovers to eat as another meal later on!   Things my group got: - Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict This thing is delicious and has a little bit of everything, mashed potatoes, chicken, eggs, tomatoes, spinach, bacon, mozzarella, biscuits, and chipotle cream sauce all over it. YUM!  - Chicken & Waffles My friends got this and liked it a LOT. I tried a bite and since I'm not a chicken & waffles fan, I wasn't too into it. I think that's just me though. Everyone else at my table disagreed and said it was really good!  - Mushroom & Swiss Burger My friend who got this was a little disappointed that it wasn't a 1 lb patty, but instead divided into 2 patties. He said it was good/okay, and I tried the fries which were seasoned well and tasty. He wishes he had gotten something that Hash House is more known for (like the two dishes above).  - Watermelon kiwi lemonade Wow this drink was BOMB! Apparently, our server told us that it was voted \"best drink in Vegas,\" at which point, my friends and I all turned to each other and were like, isn't that the Fat Tuesday??? Anyways, he totally sold us on the drink and we got three of them. Wow, he was not kidding, it was soooo good. The drink comes in a glass which has the flavors layered, with the red watermelon on the top, yellow lemonade in the middle, and green kiwi on the bottom. It's also garnished with a slice of watermelon on the rim of the glass. Definitely looked really pretty and Instagram-worthy, if you want to take pictures. ;) When you're ready to drink, make sure to mix it up first. It tasted really refreshing and everyone in my group really liked it!  This place is not the best for large groups. We had a group of 19 and they said their largest table held 15. We agreed to be split up into different tables then, but somehow, they still saw it as being fit to charge us gratuity??? I was at a table of 5, seated so far away from the rest of my group that there were several tables in between us and I could barely see them. Not sure where they got off justifying that but whatever. That's the only reason I'm docking a star, but everything else was great.  TL; DR: - Portion sizes are huge, split with a friend. Trust me, you'll still be stuffed. - Try what Hash House is known for: fried chicken benedict, chicken & waffles, & the watermelon kiwi lemonade. - Not good for large groups (15+) and even if you split into different tables, they'll still tack on gratuity.  - DELICIOUS food, and if you've never been here before, you must try it!",

Been here a few times before and the family has always enjoyed it but this time my daughter ordered the BBBlt (I think that's how they describe it on the menu), & I couldn't have been more disappointed for her. Unlike the description, there were only 6 pieces of bacon which didn't come close to comparing to the size of the bread or the huge amounts of lettuce & tomato they used. And if you're still thinking it sounds good, the bacon was not the bacon we eat everyday. I'm not sure if it was from a different animal, that or very bad grease/gasoline flavoring, but I didn't want to eat it let alone have my 15 yr old finish the sandwich. 3 day old bacon would have been better!Anyway... I did like the fried green tomatoes!",

She would not honor a coupon because she said it was going to be valid on the next visit. It didn't say that on the coupon. When we first walked in the greeter told us we could use these coupons. I explain that to her but she still would not honor the two coupons that we wanted to use for two separate tables. We had 10 people all together in our two parties. She was rude, argumentative,  condescending and lacked the essential people skills that are required of somebody in her position. All together our bill was over $250 and she would not honor the $10 coupons that were displayed at the front when we first got there. She would only on her one of them. To put a cherry on top of all of this when we got to the front after paying the coupons were gone all of them! I asked to speak with the manager one more time to ask her where the coupons were and when she came out she said she had removed them I asked her why and she said that she was going to change the rules. Okay really. That tells you everything. She should have honored our coupons because the verbiage did not indicate to use on your next visit. We will never go to that Hash Hash a Go Go restaurant again. And believe me it was not the $10 it was the principle of the thing. It's appalling how these people can get away with the bait and switch.",

We went before noon and it got busy after we came. Very sticky menus and smelly table (assuming from a dirty rag) made it difficult to completely enjoy my meal. We had 5 children and 4 adults. The chicken tender kid's meal was not popular. The kids did not like the breading and it came with no sauce. The butter penne pasta was more popular with a generous portion. I didn't try any of the breakfast items that were ordered. Nothing spectacular. My chicken and waffle was actually better than expected. I'm not a chicken breast sort of person but I finished my shared portion of the chicken (waffles had baked in bacon) and my sister also liked it. As you can tell from the photo, portions are huge. The pancake was at least 6 to 7 inches in diameter (bigger than a basketball). I think this is the main draw to this place. I don't think I would go again. The smelly table and very sticky menus were complete turn offs for me as these things are very basic things that restaurant can do well.",

    "text": "Everything about Vegas is over the top.  One of the most over the top breakfasts can be had at Hash House a Go Go.  They are known for their crazy concoctions of burgers stacked high, pancakes larger than pizzas, and breakfast plates big enough for three, four maybe. I have been to the one in San Diego, and the long wait was rewarded with plates of impossible to finish food.  Delicious at that.  Going to Vegas, knowing there was a Hash House off the strip and on the strip, my breakfast was set.  We ordered the iced pistachio mocha to start things off.  It was milky and ice cold.  The pistachio taste was subtle, but there.  It was similar to the Nutella shake at Burger Bar. The chocolate was a nice background flavor.  Imagine chocolate hazelnut (nutella) but then replace the hazelnut with pistachio. It worked!  Tasty!  The craziest dish I have ever seen was the sausage gravy pot pie.  It had scrambled egg and mashed potatoes which was normal.  This was I guess their version of sausage and biscuits, but mutated to a giant monster.  The bottom was a bowl formed by an upside down hat made of a biscuit type bread.  Inside the bowl was massive amounts of mashed potatoes which kind of sucked. There was even a bunch underneath the makeshift bowl.    I was looking for more sausage pieces, though there were some.  After a few bites of this dish, it was a bit tiring.  I don't see how anyone can finish this dish.  Carb overload is an understatement.  My chorizo hash was sensible, but still came in a skillet.  It had jalapeno, red onion, cheddar cheese, and fresh tomatoes.  The kick from the jalapeno was a wake up call, especially compared to the monotone of the pot pie.  Chorizo is spicy as well, so this dish had a lot of flavor. The eggs were perfectly cooked over easy.  Though there was nothing special about this one, it at least kept me interested.  Hash House a Go Go is a place to go eat.  They make sure you are full, and you leave with a doggy bag every time. This is the opposite of tapas small plates.  You get one big plate, and a lot of it.  The food isn't boring for sure.  They try to keep it interesting with interesting combinations and portions that are too big to make sense. I guess that is the fun of it all.  Vegas is all about buffets, but with Hash House, you will get enough -- don't worry.",

Burgers served very nicely but lacked flavor. Margarita was SWEEEET and very little alcohol. For eight dollars I expected better.Fries were delicious...and I don't usually like fries.Crisp and hot.I'll go back to try the breakfast but have had better burgers.",

It's 109 out and they didn't even bring us water. So we left and went to the egg and I down the street. Muck better service and better food anyways. Here's a big blank blank blank to the  hash house a go go  Last Friday morning.  About 30 minutes before I posted this review. Maybe 9 to 10 am. Some girl come out and checked to make sure our puppy was a service dog. And then went back inside. And a few minutes later a short guy with ash or light brown hair early to mid 20's came peeked out the door. Looked at us. Then went back inside and then we waited another 15 minutes then we left.",

    "text": "Yes, it is possible to eat too much Vegas buffet and eat too many pieces of sushi and literally whatever healthy options you can find.  That's when I decided I needed some good ole fashioned breaky to slow down the good stuff that I had stuffed myself with at the buffet.  Holy mother of all that is holy!!1!  The portions here are astounding!  From the monstrous hot chocolate to the chicken and waffle platter, I felt like a tiny little man in front of these gargantuan plates of \"twisted farm food\".    On my first trip (to Vegas and HHAGG) I noticed a sign that asked me to tweet my presence at this funky eatery to receive a special surprise.  Special surprise is right, I was given a PBR in a paper sack!  Quite the shift in gears from free cabernet at the roulette table, and might I add, welcomed.  I ordered one of the hashes which was brought promptly in a ten inch cast iron skillet.    \"Was this heaven?\" I had to pinch myself.  So much for dieting.    It was our second trip to Vegas that sealed it for me.  I ordered the scrambles with sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and goat cheese.  This is one of my all time favorites, I will eat sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese on anything, but it felt special mixed into my egg plate that was complete with a biscuit and home fried potatoes.  As a side I had to have their bacon.  The word straight from the owner's mouth was that it comes from a company that has been in business at least a hundred years and was chosen on its merit of being some of the nicest honey cured bacon in the land.  I'm sold.    Did I mention you could wear one of their flapjacks as a helmet and tie it under your chin?  Yep, they are as big as your fat head.    Hash House a Go Go has hundreds of reviews but I'm fairly certain I am the first to suggest wearing their food as protective gear.  Somebody make a Hash House a Ga Ga reference before I blow a gasket, I am in need of some good jokes.  This restaurant, however, is no joke when it comes to serving hearty portions of delicious breakfast food, and this foody is a slave to the twisted farm food frenzy for life!",

I have to confess, I had never had chorizo, but I really liked it. It was sauteed so it was slightly crispy and paired with jalapenos which made it really spicy. I really liked it though. My friends had the pancakes and I thought that they were awesome! Not only were they massive, but they were really soft.  I took some of my breakfast home and I ate it for a few days. Thus this place definitely gives you bang for your buck!   I did think that their service was exceptionally slow, thus I would rate them 3 out of 5.",

    "text": "I must say, with all the hype about this place, I was really expecting more, to say the least!  We came here on a Wednesday morning around 11:30, and growing up in the center of PA around farms, I was looking for a good old fashion, mans breakfast. What I found was over sized, over priced and overly hyped food that cost a lot more than it was worth (unless you can eat a pancake the size of a basketball in one sitting).  I had The Tractor Driver Combo with sausage and a water and my lovely girlfriend had the Red Leaf Salad with a water. When our waters came out, her's tasted like the last occupations of the glass was milk and it had no been properly washed, but mine was OK. The food came relatively quick, but the portion sizes were just ridiculous!   Now, I know this is america and we have to super size everything just to stuff our faces with it, but I mean come on, who REALLY needs a pancake that size, with a side of eggs the size of small fist and two little sausage links? The eggs and sausage were VERY good, I would have easily sacrificed my flying saucer sized pancake for more of the other 2! Plus, the pancake itself was kind of stiff... Almost like it had been pre-made and sat under a heating lamp.  On the bright side, my girlfriend said her salad was delicious, but again, she could only eat about half of it because, well, she is 5'4 - 100 lbs... Not a 300 lb. grazing cow in the middle of a pasture!  For these two meals, waters, with tip, the total was29$, which isn't really a BAD price per say, but 1/2 of all our food was throw out because of the size portions. Why don't we cut the sizes in half, and charge me, lets say 20$ total with tip... Makes sense to me!!  All-in-all, A Denny's Grand Slam Breakfast which has 2 regular sized pancakes, double the meat and more eggs for about 8$ is MUCH better than this meal for $14...   We will probably not return here, but my girlfriend is the boss, so, it's really not my call : )",

It sounds like quantity over quality but the food taste was decent. We ordered:  Salmon hash - salmon and veggies over a mountain of mashed potatoes  vegetarian quesadilla - huge quesadilla with spicy sauce on top  sage fried chicken - fried chicken covered in a layer of melted cheese, on top of open biscuits, on top of a mountain of mashed potatoes  It wasn't the best breakfast food I ever had, but maybe a little better than average. We enjoyed the novelty of such ridiculous portion sizes, but this isn't somewhere I could be a regular of, it would ruin anyone's diet. I think they have normal breakfast options on their menu as well, but as a first time, we had to try the popular stuff.",

I am a huge fan of Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles in Southern California, and this restaurant gives me a placebo for Roscoe's when I need it.  I have also tried the popular dish that was featured on Man vs. Food (I forget the name). Again, I enjoyed it, but it was not anything special either.  During busy times, the line to get a seat can be VERY long. Plan ahead of time or prepare to wait (sometimes outside).

Video games destracted me, you know.  Seriously though, this place is delightful. There are so many great \"country\" food items. And the portions are freaking gigantic. Like, if I stacked every part of the plate up like a Lego tower, I'm pretty sure it would be as tall as me or at least close to me. I kid you not. But oh my heavens it's delightful. I don't mind eating my height in that food.   My brother and I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and a side of sweet potato fries and decided we were going to share it so we could both watch our delicate figure, ya know. The freaking waffles had bacon in it!! The waffles...had bacon....made inside them. Oh my goodness I was in love.   Now, with saying how good this place was, I'm sure you can imagine it was pretty busy. Surprisingly busy. Saying this, however, our wait for a table was only about 20 minutes and once we were seated, we were never hurting for a refill or anything. They were really good about coming over to check if everything was good with us. Almost felt famous for a bit there. Seriously though, you guys should definately check this place out.

I eyed the pancakes, chicken and waffles, and other dishes coming out... and there's no way I could finish any of them.  Presentation of the food is what pushes it into the five star range. They do a great job.  I've had two of the skillet plates and a pork tenderloin sandwich, and every time the food was delicious. The BLT Bloody Mary is a special treat.  If you go at peak hours, you're probably going to have a long wait for a table. That's why I try to never go to any popular eatery during peak hours if I can help it.",

    "text": "Hash House A Go Go is a place that you might both fear and love. It's like a roller coaster or a hot temptress. You know it's bad for you, but you still want it. Hash is definitely a True battle of Man verse food. They contribute to our the great over-sized nation of ours. Please check your diets at the door.   I was extremely excited to try out Hash House, because all the reviews I read made it sound so amazing. It is very hard to find a great place for breakfast in Vegas. I was tired of waiting in a huge line at Paris Buffet, so I thought it's time to go on a Man vs. Food trip. Most of the time, I cannot stand places that have too much hype. Most things that are over hyped usually suck like the Crapple iphone and Verizon's I CAN'T hear you now network. Also, In-N-Out... It's good, but not crack like most people say it is.. (I don't endorse or use crack). Even though, I tried to come here without the high expectations, it was unavoidable. I felt like a little kid on Christmas morning. First off I am not a idiot! A lot of the bad reviews I read were from people that waited 2 hours and didn't like their food. I'm sorry, but if you waited 2 hours to eat anywhere I would be bitter too! I only waited 5 minutes maybe 10 minutes max, so suck on that! Haha. I went on a weekday around 9am. Brilliant!!!!  I know the portions are big, but how's the quality? Did you finish dish by yourself? I don't like pigging out should I still go?  The key is bring a friend and share. The quality is good! Don't expect a 5 star restaurant or a new cuisine from a top chef. This is simple breakfast food on steroids. I highly recommend having 2 stomachs and consulting with a doctor before coming here. To my surprise the customer base was a lot smaller than I expected. The restaurant was packed shortly after I arrived, but there were no Plus sized models here. I saw some normal sized patrons and a few gorgeous model types. I really was set on trying the Sage Chicken Benedict, but since my friend was not a fan of hollandaise sauce I went with the Chicken and Waffles of course! Let's just say Roscoe's has nothing on Hash House! I thought Roscoe's clogged arteries, but Hash made Roscoe's look like a Diet Soda verses a Milk Shake. The Chicken was very juicy and extremely crispy! I really like the corn flake batter, although the spices were a bit lacking, but nothing hot sauce can't fix. The chicken cannot beat Roscoe's, but that's not a fair comparison. You definitely get 4 times the food of Roscoe's for the same price. I am very picky Fried Chicken eater, so I wish they would find some Grandma's secret recipe for Chicken so this dish could become 10 instead of a 7. The waffles with bacon inside.... Wow. A tear came to my eyes... you had me at bacon. I thought that waffles couldn't be any better, but you took my fork away! If I was lucky enough to have the genetics of Brad Pitt or LL Cool J, I would eat these waffles everyday.  Should you try Hash House a Go Go? YES! Unfortunately, I only have one stomach and I could not finish half of a dish by myself. If you are a picky eater, you may want to take your snobby as$ else where. If you are a huge breakfast fan, like me, give Hash a try. Bring a huge appetite and go early. Note to self, don't order the large Orange Juice next time, it was so large I did not finish it. Fresh OJ with out much water, it was like trying to drink a huge carton of concentrate. I will go for a tasty small next time. Stop staring at the pictures and go try it already!!! COME Onnnnnn. :)",

When it came back the dish was much smaller and no one even came to check further.  Didn't even comp the soda for giving me raw chicken!

This time instead of getting a hash I got Andy's sage fried chicken which came with garlic mashed potatoes, two biscuits, scamble eggs and smothered with this Chipotle gravy type sauce. Delicious! My friend and husband got the breakfast special which came with a huge pancake, eggs and meat. The pancakes were super fluffy and delicious! I love how everything comes in huge portions :) The only downside from the experience is our waitress was barely attentive to us. My friend said she was busy flirting with a guy at the bar instead of checking up on our meals. The food at least is as delicious as I remembered :)",

THE BAD: Our first server Lupe was not only awwwwfullllll, but not welcoming at all!!! Kind of made for an awkward lunch. She had an attitude like no other and made it apparent that she did not want to wait on our party. She made comments and had a tone that really should have been up to the managers attention, it was that bad. However, the members in our large party chose other wise.   OH, OH!!! LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT THE NASTY HAIR found IN OUR FOOD!!! Nasty, gross, and unpleasant!!!Our server had the audacity to try to charge us for it!!!   THE (LUPE) ATTITUDE:      We ordered three coffees, four were brought out, we told her there were only three ordered and her response was,  \"there were two orders of one decaf and one regular,\" so we apologized any way and said we only needed three, at which she repeated that we had ordered two and two. Oh my gosh was she adamant until she realized we were NOT going to take the extra coffee so she threw in  \"There were two orders, but I'll take it back.\"     When we tried to double check our order to make sure we didn't have a coffee incident again she replied, ( in a tone a teenager would use with their parents) \"Yeah. I got it.\"     She finally brought out our food and we hadn't even started to eat before she had brought out the tabs! Not ONCE did she bother to come and check on us. Coffee cups went empty without a fill and so did our water cups.      After all was said and done, we noticed there was a name Jess on our bill. It turns out that the unpleasant LUPE was helping out Jess, but no one seemed to inform us before hand. It was unfortunate that LUPE could altar our dining experience because my family and I were hoping to add this place as a dining spot to our yearly Vegas family trip.  MY ADVICE...DON'T GO IF YOU'RE IN A LARGE PARTY & if LUPE is your server, request some one else!!! It might make a difference in your dining experience!!!",

    "text": "OVERALL: 9.4/10 (Yelp conversion: 4.7/5). This place has the homely vibe with the portion sizes perfect for families. A definite recommendation for brunch or breakfast.   Showed up at exactly 730am (when it opened) to beat the rush, since it's off the strip and somewhat off the beaten path (especially for a Saturday morning).   Ordered a nitro coffee and the tractor combo (2 eggs, sausage/bacon/potatoes and choice of flap jack, waffle, or French toast), with poached eggs, sausage, and French toast. From the initial conversation, they don't have many things with peanuts, but do have some menu items with pecans and cashews (which is fine for me, but those with severe nut allergies should bring this up ASAP so the staff can best help you). I was somewhat torn between the Chicken and waffles (at $18.99 it's pricey, but apparently a New York Times favourite) and the Tractor combo (cheaper, at $13.99, but also, customizability is king), but ultimately customizing my experience won out. If I come here tomorrow morning I'll definitely order the Chicken & Waffles.   Decor is quite nice; quite homely feel with plenty of variable-sized booths (2 sized, 4 sized, and 6 sized at a quick glance).   Nitro coffee and water arrived after only 5 minutes (ordered at the same time as food); the coffee was great tasting - not too bitter, but a good amount of flavour - a welcome wake-up coffee to start the day. Food arrived after 18 minutes.  Some quick ratings, based on my usual template:  1) VARIETY/SELECTION: 9/10. Lots of selection, but the menu was all over the place in terms of what went where. It was difficult to follow the process of what you received with what item, since all of the sections were different font sizes, in different shapes, with different prices.   2) FRESHNESS: 9/10. The poached eggs and French toast were fine; sausage seemed reheated, banana peel was too chewy for me (either too ripe or stale, unsure which at this point).   3) VALUE FOR MONEY: 10/10. Portion sizes are extremely generous; I didn't end up finishing all of the French toast but I was able to eat everything else.   4) SERVICE: 10/10. Fast, attentive service. Drink and food came within 20 minutes and all questions were answered promptly.   5) PRICE: 9/10. It's a little on the higher side, but given what you get, I'm not necessarily complaining.",

I never caught before the full slices of bacon in the waffles.  Be sure to share an item by having the second person order a side (maybe bacon or sausage) and avoid the split charge.  Our group had some hash, meat loaf, the 1 lb burger and more.  Plenty of happy diners in our group.  No crowd at lunchtime on a weekday and no wait for party of 10.",

(plus weekend brunch specials are paired with domestic beer choices.)  This time the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict is awesome and was recommended on \"Man vs. Food.\" I ended up taking more than half of it home for breakfast the next day.  My wife had the bacon and avocado scramble. It was good - get it with the grilled mashed potatoes instead of the fried potatoes.   My children had the kids French toast. It comes with a fried banana and is sprinkled with pecans and cinnamon. It is a large portion and can be split between two kids.  Coffee is good and hot. Service is prompt. Portions are large. Hash House is a definite Vegas favorite.",

    "text": "I actually like it here, but I'm not going crazy on the stars because I agree with the gist of some other reviews: the food is big, and the menu is interesting, but the food just doesn't taste as good as it sounds. There is always a long list of ingredients in the description, and while you are promised what sounds like an orgy of chipotle cream, smoked mozzarella, caramelized onions, basil pesto, and other tastebud stimulators that sound great on paper, what you get seems a little more like a pile of somewhat dry mashed potatoes, tasting more like the paper than what you imagined. There are dishes I enjoy- the sage fried chicken is consistently good, though the waffles are not crispy and deteriorate too fast, and, number one complaint, the huge portion is accompanied by a thimble-sized pitcher of syrup. What the hell? Same for those hubcap-sized pancakes(which come in various flavor combos but with very little flavor, and with insufficient syrup to wet them down, it's like trying to eat a blanket). And how about those giant biscuits they serve before dinner? I'm a fan, but they went from supplying one Barbie-sized pitcher of honey to the whole table, to skipping that entirely and just drizzling on a little (very little) before serving them. For a place that's so generous with the portions, and that must plow through a field of rosemary daily, garnishing even the plates that have nothing to do with said herb, why are they so reluctant to part with the condiments? Maybe they could save a couple of bucks by ditching their other inexplicable practice of adding what can only be described as french-fried broom straws to all their dishes. You spend the first few minutes just picking weeds from your plate.  The meatloaf is quite good, as is the grilled cheese, and Baby girl loves the salmon. The side vegetables are usually well cooked and seasoned. I've never tried dessert, because I can't fathom ever getting that far, and I've been tempted to try  one of those giant burgers, but never do because I know I can't finish it and re-heated burgers are just not good. Strangely, though, the leftovers we do bring home (which is always), seem to taste better than the original did. Who can explain it? But the HH brown bags are always seized upon by the family vultures with midnight munchies. Yes, I'll keep coming here to dine, but I will never again make the mistake of ordering the Thanksgiving dinner to go. The fried turkey was ok, the veggies were raw, the dressing was dry and flavored only with salt, the portions of potatoes were shockingly small- less than they serve on a single dinner in the restaurant, and the Snickers bread pudding dessert wound up in the trash. Unprecedented. Oh, and the number one reason I will keep coming back? You can almost always get your hands on a half off coupon. Then it's REALLY a bargain!",

They are know for there big food and awesome hashes.  The restaurant's one-pound stuffed burger is a prime example of the gut-busting gourmet comfort food menu. The dinning room is very comfortable with booths and tables with stainless steel tabletops fill the warm and inviting space. Very Urban Farm is the best way to describe the setting. Music was very interesting, was not what I expected. A mix of down tempo beats, chill-out tunes and a mix of sing-a- long hip hop favorites. Totally loved it. (Jamming Out to OPP with Lunch rocked my world)  The Chicken and Waffles was a rock star item on the menu. Also very good where the Meatloaf sandwich and the Hammered porkloin sandwich. Service was good and friendly.  *** UPDATE******  Hash House now has a location located on the strip in the Imperial Palace Hotel.  So if you are in the area stop by.",

The chicken was moist, but the breading had absolutely no taste. Salt & pepper was missing. The waffle was creative, but very chewy. The dried grass (leeks) didn't belong.

Then we realized some of us had different menus BUT most of us made our food choices. We asked the waiter who seemed to be annoyed by our presence, and he hastily snagged the menus from our hands... minus one star.   Lunch started at 11:30 - I was willing to wait but again he seemed annoyed and having to ask if that was OK - minus one star.   Food came out in HUGE portions. Chicken house hash was yummy! I got the stuffed burger w/ bacon and mashed potatoes - yummy less the spicy funky sauce that was drizzled all over it... I had to ask what the spices were 3 times bc I'm allergic to certain ones and the waiter kept coming back but w/ no answer. minus another star. My food was cool by the time i dove into it. The chicken and waffles was HUGE - like 4 ppl couldn't finish. waffles were dense w/ slices of bacon laid across the middle... eh, nothing special.   all in all cool restaurant, good music, hearty portions, but you get a low rating bc your waiter was a jerk, and didn't care about food allergies at the table... not cool.",

The portion was huge and tasty, but the service was slow and just seemed like they were more in the back then on the floor. It took about 7 minutes after giving our drink order to actually receive a root beer and a tangerine juice and only 4 tables in the main dining room were sat and that included my table. then another 5 minutes went by before were figured out who our actual server was when she actually took our order. The food came out in a timely manner, but half way through eating, the server dropped off the check as if she was was in a rush to get us cashed out. Not happy with the amateur service, but the food was great.",

Oh and did I mention, these portions a freakin' HUGE.  My friends and I came here for breakfast after a long drive from the Bay Area. We knew we needed a big breakfast to give us some energy for the day and for EDC.  We arrived around 9:45am or so and was promptly seated. The place was already super packed. As we walked by the tables, I took a peek at what other people were eating and wow. I don't know how people can finish an entire portion. (Maybe this is why America is so fat...although...the food was bomb).  My girlfriend and I shared the signature sage chicken and waffles ($18). If you look at the pictures, you can see that the plate comes with two large pieces of fried chicken, 4-6 pieces of bacon infused waffles and a lot of onions and sage. I was pleasantly surprised. Everything tasted really good. The chicken was soft and tender on the inside and the Bacon/Waffle combination was amazing. Forreal though, it was more than enough food for 2 people. One of my friends, did however, finished his entire meal...  Our server was amazing. He kept coming back to check up on us and made sure we were good. He encouraged me to eat my greens as well!!   Overall, great food, huge portions, great to split! Come if you're on a date or hungry enough to eat for 2!",

We went to this location on Saturday, Dec 10 around 1:00 p.m. ish. No lines and were seated immediately.   Service was friendly and portions are large. Not sure if the deejay is there all the time, but he was there Saturday, and boy was it annoying. There didn't seem to be a place in the restaurant where the music was quieter. We could not have a conversation for the entire meal. If this is a technique to insure quick turnover of tables they succeeded on our table. I think we were in and out in less than 30 minutes.   We ordered a scramble with sundried tomatoes (me) and the grilled cheese sandwich for my friend. Both seemed more manageable than the massive portions of the waffles and chicken, or the wheel-sized pancakes. My scramble was OK, the grilled potatoes got cold halfway through the meal. Best part of the meal was the biscuit. My friend appreciated the grilled cheese sandwich but could only eat half and took the rest home in a box.   With tip this meal was about $40. I guess you got to go here at least once to see if all of the hubbub from TV is worth it for you. Perhaps without the loud music I may have enjoyed it more. For me, the deejay and heavy base ruined the experience. I like to enjoy my food not having to feel the base of the music in my chest. The place is located in a rather depressing shopping mall and it feels all a bit dingy and dirty.",

Now chicken is soggy and except for the bacon, the waffles were flavorless. Maple syrup was artificial. I recall multiple pieces of chicken but now there's only on in the signature chicken and waffles.  Mashed potatoes still rocked. Biscuits were better than yardbirds but a bit on the dry side for me.   Service was awesome.

I'm going with the 4 stars as the food we ordered was good, though I personally don't believe that anyone can really mess up breakfast food... and they didn't.  My family really enjoyed their potatoes, both the mashed and breakfast style. My daughter LOVED her biscuit and took mine to go!  The portions large and the presentation were on point.   The service was basic, not good not bad.  Our server appeared pretty busy, but didn't seem slammed.  I guess she just didn't care to go out of her way to provide quality service.  She stopped at the table twice after we received our food, once immediately after, but upon receiving a head nod from only one of our four she quickly darted away before anyone else could respond; when there was actually a need.  It took another several mins, before we could wave her down again.   I'd go back, but likely to only take a visiting guest for the novelty of it.  There are just so many other breakfast places to try!  $70+ for breakfast for 4",

You definitely should split with someone else though.. especially for the budget conscious.   I got the Chicken and Waffles, and it was pretty dry. I guess I was expecting too much?   My cousin tried the Milfried Chicken Sandwich... meh. the bread was so thick and it actually hurt his jaw to chew it.   My other cousin got the salmon... big mistake. This was the one thing that they skimped out on..  My uncle got the Chicken Benedict, and this was honestly my favorite dish. I was almost gonna get it, but i always try to get different dishes from others (that way I could try theirs... :D)  Oh, and Idk what i was thinking getting a caramel mocha. I must've been tired? but it was hot, and I didn't read the menu right.. so my cousin who ordered the salmon took it along with several bites of all our meals.  Don't get the salmon. The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict is your best bet, everything else is just ok.  Oh, and my cousin also got a Mojito... sucks. I had the best one i'd ever tasted in Korea, and this one let me down.  3 stars. Womp womp..",

I caught this on the TV a few days before I went to Vegas but only a few highlights - about how it's a must visit when in Vegas.   The chicken was partially soggy and a bit on the dry side inside.

This place was visited by Man vs. Food so I thought I give it a try . . . bad idea! The service was deplorable; even the water was luke warm and tasted rancid. My food was thrown together with no thought and piled high to compensate for lack of flavor, taste, and creativity. Chipotle has better ingredients than this place. I/we will NEVER return! Anyone who praises this restaurant is either an employee, related to the owners, or watches too much Beverly Hillbillies!",

Andy's Sage Chicken with Waffles was bland (3 stars, at least it fed 2 people!).  The Boston Hash (crabcakes with hash) rated 4 stars because the salsa was divine and the lump crab did taste fresh.  Busy even on a Monday morning.  The servers were very helpful and steered us towards ordering any of their benedict plates (what HHAGG is known for).  Excellent coffee service, my cup was always topped off.  The fresh strawberry preserve that is available on all tables is worth a taste (3 stars).  The apple juice was fresh and unsweetened (tasted yummy!) but their milk container had a piece of splenda wrapper floating in it.  Ewww ... that alone should give them a rating of 1 star.  Plus, there are no teaspoons or stirrers so how the heck do I mix my coffee?  Add $2.50 for a split plate charge, or treat yourself to 3 strips of bacon for an extra $2.99.

    "text": "Short: Sub-par food in large proportions dressed up for no reason with a loud atmosphere.   Visited this place with a friend after we've been curious of it after a long time. Disappointed, big time. Food was decent, service was decent, place the decent, atmosphere was loud.  I ordered some chorizo hash, and my friend had french toast. The hash had deep-friend potatoes (probably from frozen), with some sauce and cheese on top. The chorizo was the soft type that just turned into liquid after it was cooked so there was only a few chunks left. It was alright, not mind blowing. My friend's french toast was worse. It was made of thick slabs of bread (good, right?) that had barely touched egg before they were fried--it was pretty much bread with a egg coating on the outside. If you didn't know: French toast is bread SOAKED in egg, and fried. But this was barely touched, so it was like eating hot bread rather than eggy goodness. The toppings were a bit bland as well.  Bottom line: If you want to go to a place that puts more priority on decorating, than actually making your food taste good, go here. Big proportions that don't need to be that big, dressed up for no reason, decent food.  Next time, we're probably going to head to Ihop or Denny's. Same food quality, better service, cheaper, and they don't play with our food.",

We went to the branch that just recently opened in the Imperial Palace rather than the original one on Sahara Blvd.  They call it \"Twisted Farm Food.\"  I call it \"Mutant Meals.\"  Everything is so out of proportion that you would swear it was injected with steroids.  My son ordered the fried chicken and waffle combo.  My wife and I had the Banana-Cinnamon waffle with grilled mash potatoes (our ten year old daughter opted for a bowl of Frosted Flakes--oh well). We really enjoyed our fare.  The pancake was outstanding and the grilled mashed very good.  Needless to say, we couldn't finish it (just barely half).  My son ate most of his chicken and waffle duo but said the chicken was dry.  The service is very friendly but not very swift (they make everything to order and it is quite likely that the size of the portions restricts what they can cook at one time.)  We liked the atmosphere and would definitely go back.  Enjoy but don't expect any diet plates.  In summary, when in Vegas, I i recommend that you \"go go\" to this place.",

I probably built it up too much in my head, I'll admit, but the food, while unique and different, is average overall. The best meal I had was the linguini with pesto sauce topped with a slab of meatloaf. The pasta portion was good but the meatloaf was very dry and gave me heartburn for hours afterwards. The meatloaf sandwich? Meh. And standard burger and fries was dry and bad as well.   I have never tried anything from the breakfast portion of the menu so I will give it one more try and see if they redeem themselves.",

    "text": "I saw Rachael Ray go and visit this place on her best of Vegas show and not the $40 a day show.  I was intrigued with how cool the place seemed overall but a bit apprehensive since she has steered me down the wrong path once.  At this place, they offered a bunch of typical breakfast fare with a sort of a modern fusion twist.  That is the best that I can describe it.  Be prepared, the portions are HUGE!  I like to think that I have a hearty appetite, but this is enough to share for two--at least for breakfast.  Dinner or lunch might be a bit different.  SERVICE We showed up on a Monday morning and the place was hopping at 10:30.  We didn't have to wait too long before our table became readily available.  Overall, the service was great and friendly.  We were checked upon often and coffee cups were always refilled.  FOOD The food was really good and impressed with how fresh things tasted.  No Krusteaz Costco pancake mix here!  Here is a breakdown of what we ordered. - Banana Brown Sugar Pancake: Holy moly!  They serve up a whopping huge pancake that is almost served up on a serving platter.  I would say that the pancake is about 1.5 feet in diameter.  My husband could only tear through about half of it.  The brown sugar was a nice touch as it was added to the top of the pancake and then browned to almost caramel.  OH!  They also have different flavors of pancakes, different fruits, coconut mango, snickers and more! - Bacon Waffle: If you are a fan of the salty sweet.  This is a must try.  When I ordered it, I thought that there would be sprinkles of bacon throughout the waffle.  Instead, there were actual strips which crisscrossed throughout the waffle.  Fancy.  TIP #1: Come hungry.  Do not order any sides since all portions are literally super sized.  TIP #2: If you can, come on a weekday vs. a weekend.  This place gets ridiculously crazy busy.",

I can't wait to go back and try the BBBLT (I think it's all the bacon that you can get from one pig) which looks amazing.

Just take the wait time to check out the menu and make your choices ahead of time. (We also scoped out the trays of food being delivered to tables as they walked by).

Then it got extended to a hour because the people at our supposed booth wouldn't leave. The thing that kept us from leaving? The huge platters of food being brought out.  Shared the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken with Maple Reduction. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=dbftVwJt5k64QnewOJUXLA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/g8On...</a>) It comes with 2 eggs, bacon, tomatoes, mashed potato, biscuit and fruit.

Why not serve excellent food in reasonable portions.  Even sharing an entree, my husband and I couldn't get through the amazing pork tenderloin.  I'm not sure I will go back.   That, and the next charge on the credit card I used there was fraudulent. Perhaps not related, but hard to ignore the timing.  It is definitely an experience, especially with the kiwi, watermelon lemonade enhanced with a shot of Don Eduardo reposado to hone down the sweet edge.    But if ridiculous food waste is an issue for you, plan to share or be able to take it home.  (note:  I used a credit card here and immediately after had several fraudulent transactions in Las Vegas.  Probably not a coincidence.)",

Sage Fried chicken and waffles were AMAZING! The biscuits and house-made strawberry preserves were delicious too. My only complaint - and it's not really a compliant, so much as the ONLY issue I had with our visit - the regular Bloody Mary was a little too spicy for an early afternoon visit. Maybe my hungover taste buds hadn't woken up just yet, or were too sensitive from all the drinking the night before (what? It's Vegas!), or it was just too darn spicy, but I just couldn't finish it. And for me saying that, the girl who orders jalapenos on pizza AND adds crushed red pepper flakes, that has to say something. Other than that...this place has definitely won a place in my heart. :)  p.s. My visit was on October 8th. I can't freakin' figure out how to change the date...I thought it would use my \"check-in\" date, but no. Whatever. You get the idea. ;)",

It's like they are afraid of using salt or actually flavoring the food. Bland doesn't begin to cover it.   Once you are seated, the service is good, fast, and generally friendly, though some of the staff members seem a little stressed or annoyed at times. My largest issue with this place is the food. Massive quantities with a rosemary sprig only go so far when it's not followed up with delicious flavor.   I have had their skillets, pancakes, and even a burger. None of them stood out as being something I would have again.  Yet every time I'm hosting a friend from out if town, I am dragged there because of the hype and publicity.   I just don't get it.",

    "text": "My friends and I stopped by here before making our long drive back to California. We got there around 12pm and people were waiting everywhere (good sign!!). We waited around 20 minutes before we got called. My friend and I shared the Fried Chicken & Waffles and ordered a side of crispy potatoes. When it came out, we sat there in shock...it was HUGE! We didn't know where to start. The description said tower of bacon waffles, and sure enough, there were 4 waffles on top of one another and 2 fried chicken breasts on top of that. The fried chicken was a little dry, but nothing a little dunk in ketchup or syrup can't fix. I could see the pieces of bacon in the waffles, which was a little overwhelming. The waffles were crunchy and pretty good; the crispy potatoes were nicely seasoned too.   One of my other friends ordered a breakfast combo and the other one ordered just the fried chicken. Both of them had mashed potatoes w/bacon, some of the heaviest mashed potatoes ever, but it was really creamy, buttery and good. The total wasn't bad either; I can't remember the exact number but I remember thinking it wasn't so bad. My friend and I who shared the chicken/waffles paid around $12 including tax and tip. We left overly stuffed and very happy.",

Let's go straight to the point:  - MORE THAN ENOUGH portions and FULL of flavour - Excellent service: prompt, polite, and accommodating  - Clean inside and outside of restaurant  American classics with a twist. They're a bit pricey but it's so worth it! There's also a 24/7 location inside The Quad to satisfy your late-night munchies. The top item in the menu is the 'Sage Fried Chicken Benedict' and is highly recommended for you first-timers and the hollandaise sauce is the star of the dish. A good place to bring a date and pig out, feed each other, or share one item since the portions are huge.   COME HERE.",

They have the very best biscuits and sausage gravy! You must try their homemade jam!  Their vanilla waffles are outstanding and they serve them with warmed syrup, which is really nice. Excellent service!!!!  Cons: IF you prefer mild, medium coffee, the coffee SUCKS!!! (My take on it) Thought that the bacon and eggs breakfast should come with more than two wimpy pieces of bacon. Thought it was outrageous that our breakfast came with a biscuit but to add a side of gravy was almost 3 dollars! I mean it's good gravy but is it made of gold? The woman's bathroom was not nicely maintained and the handicapped stall would not lock.  Bottom line: The food IS very good and we will definitely come back.",

I got super excited when I saw the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaraunt.com&s=76748a9d229d46000e00baa8f02ce36f742a35e2ebc9fa48519ecb77420af335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaraunt.com</a> coupons out there for them and even plotted a time that I figured they wouldn't be too busy so that I could sneak in with my family and get a nice dinner.   So we show up at 530p on Saturday and the place was absolutely empty.  Sat down and were promptly waited upon.  Made my selection of the tenderloin at the top of the menu and my wife had the butternut squash (she's nutso for squash).  Waiter arrives about 5 minutes later with HUGE biscuits with honey.  Great!!  It went downhill from there. When the entrees arrived, all I can say is HOLY &%^$, those are huge portions.  But what they make up for in volume is the huge blandness and poor flavoring.  The tenderloin had an orangish/brown sauce that had zero redeeming value and it was rather thick and gloppy.  There was melted cheese in the mashed potatoes that was like a nasty skin.  The tenderloin was a little overcooked.  My wife said her squash had no real interesting flavor, just seemed baked and the risotto inside was just very average.  However, we did have enough to take home to feed a small family. Nice people, huge portions, but nothing really great.",

    "text": "This place is like the white guy in \"The Great White Hope\" all hype but it can't deliver.  The girl who seated us was friendly and the tables were a good size, but it pretty much went downhill from there.  Our waitress was abrupt and they have a lot of hidden policies.  When I asked if I could make substitute the side on the dish I wanted from one potato product to another I was told \"no substitutions.\"  This is crazy.  I know what the kitchen looks like, it has a bunch of containers full of potato products next to each other.  I was just asking them to scoop the potato from the container next to it, not rework the main part of the dish.  If no substitutions are allowed, you should put that on your  menu.  So, instead of the mix grill, I ordered the Chicken and Waffles.  One friend ordered their signature dish, the Fried Chicken Benedict, and another also got the Chicken and Waffles to split with his wife.  Then we were told that there is a $2.50 extra plate charge, unless we wanted to order another side for a few bucks, which just so happens to come with an extra plate.  Which would be fine, except they don't have this policy listed anywhere on the menu.    So we wait and she plops some biscuits on the table, which were pretty good, but still just biscuits.  Then our main dishes arrive.  Disgusting is the only word I can use to describe this meal.  Everything is coated in syrup, but not enough to taste any syrup, just enough to make everything sticky and they don't give you more syrup so you can add more if you wish.  The breading on the chicken is thick and completely flavourless (it took me quite a while to find even a hint of sage in the breading).  The waffles were alright, but tasted like they come from a box mix.  The worst part is not a single one of us got a dish that had any seasoning.  Out of three dishes and a side, not a single one had a speck of salt or pepper on it that we did not add ourselves with the shakers.  Not the chicken, not the potatoes, not the egg on the benedict.    Food NEEDS seasoning.  To completely leave it out of everything you make is an insult not only to your customers but the food itself.  Word of advice, save your money and go to any one of the other, cheaper, breakfast places.  You'll be much happier.",

Had to keep flagging her down for napkins, refills, all while the owner Mary walked by.  Food finally came and was decent, but the service killed it.  Had to flag Mary the owner down again to come and run our card.  Didn't ask how or food was, just cold and stoic.  Guess we were the wrong skin tone for her liking.

The service staff all looked like they came out of punk rock band or belong in West Hollyweird. Guess the freakier you are, the better, for this place. The food made us so sick that both my husband and I suffered from the worse case of heartburn that we had to cancel my romantic Birthday dinner that night. I ordered the eggs scrambled and I asked if they sauteed the onions and our server said they could not for us. I was shock that she could not accommodate my needs. So I had order it without the onion. The Biscuit was dry and tasted like chalk; the garnish honey dew melon was not ripe and should not have been on the plate. The potatoes were liked twice deep fried and they were not hot, my eggs were not so hot either. I got the feeling that my food sat for a while. My husband ordered the Chicken and waffles. Ok people but sticking a spring of Rosemary in everything does not classy things up. The service was lousy. Out server did not anticipate any of our needs. For example filling up our beverages and all the things that should have come with our meal like syrup, butter, and more napkins. We had to ask her for everything. She kept pulling disappearing acts as if she went out back to smoke a cigarette.  The music was so loud it made the whole experience even worse.

Pancakes, bacon, omlettes, hash browns, crepes, the whole breakfast menu I love.  And I'm here to tell you this place served me the single best breakfast I've had in my life so far.  I didn't even want to go here.  We were in Vegas checking out the new \"M\" casino and my wife said her old boss recommended this place for breakfast.  I heard the name of it, and just thought ok another hip diner joint trying to make a buck off their decor and loud music rather than the food itself.  Boy was I wrong.  I think I got the Country Hash Breakfast (?), and my wife got the Eggs Benedict something or other.  The meal names are long and not typical.  To drink they give you option of fresh squeezed orange juice and tangerine juice.  Never saw Tangerine juice on a menu before, so I got that.  Our food was so damn good I was so suprised.  My wife's eggs benedict were piled high on delicious mashed potatoes.  They give you a ton of coffee related drink options (lattes, cappicinos, etc.).  Please do yourself a favor and go to this place if you like breakfast like I do.  5-star hands down, best breakfast I ever had (so far).  Its kinda far down the strip at the beginning, like 2 miles before you get to Mandalay Bay, but the M casino is upscale and cool to check out.  Just a warning, there was a 45 minute wait on Sunday morning at like 11 am.  But they give you a beeper and you can cruise the casino while waiting.",

The service is always good. The servers all seem to work together as a team and they seem to have a really well organized system. The food comes out fairly quickly once you order and people are always checking up on your drinks or whether or not you need something. I have been here more than a handful of times and even though it's not my thing to try different menu items at places I go to, I almost always do here because you almost can't go wrong.  Our favorites are Sage chicken and waffles Bacon waffle-personal favorite Skillets and scrambles-you can't go wrong! And don't forget to get a bite of someone's biscuit and fresh jam if yours doesn't come with one!  One thing to be said, while I see their pancakes are popular, I personally do not care for the very thick style pancakes. These pancakes are almost 3 times as thick as a regular pancake and about 4 times as large area wise. But again, that's more of a personal preference, not a negative review.",

Even with the two of us sharing the plate, we couldn't finish it.  It was just waay to much but it was very good.  The reason for the 2 stars was our server, he straight ignored us 3 times so for every time he ignored us I took off a star.  I was the first one who tried to call him over after we ordered 10 minutes ago and I was still waiting for my ice tea, I looked him dead in the eyes and waved him over and he turned around and walked into the back.  Then he repeated that twice with my boyfriend.  How f***ing rude!  Good food, I would love to come back and try some more of the dishes but our server ruined our experience.",

They kept bringing the wrong orders to the tables all around us.  I guess the upside to it was that we got to see what all the other food on the menu looked like.  They definitely don't kid around when it comes to portions .. they're HUGE!  The beautiful thing is that once our food did arrive, the explosion of flavor was well worth the madness.

    "text": "I think if you're the average overweight American, then this place would be nice for you.  It's huge portion for the average price restaurant with food that will surely get you on the obese side fairly quickly.  My family and I went here because of the Yelp review, but I guess some reviews are not really helpful.  We ordered two dishes to share to see how good it is, but it was terrible.  The \"scramble eggs\" are pre-made; yellow and dry and on the cold side for scramble eggs.  The scramble eggs with salmon was scramble, but they added the cold salmon and didn't really cook it anymore serving it on the cold side.  Also the salmon smells really \"fresh\".  You can smell the fish smell and it was really bad; cold salmon.  Not to mentioned their \"abundant mix fruits\" came only with 3 small slices of pineapple and 2 tiny pieces of oranges.  Serious now.  Most of the dishes you can tell are pre-made, hence you will get your dishes fairly quick.  I did mentioned to the waitress about the disappointment and she did offer to make a new one, but I just wanted to finish and move on.  One thing I don't trust is complaining to your server and mechanic and have the same people who originally jacked up their service to try and redo the same service.  You might get a surprise flavor in your scramble eggs or a loose bolt in your engine.  I rather just Yelp about it and eat somewhere else.  If you think about eating here, just go to a Dennys, unless you're weight challenge, you can get full here.",

This will never happen to you here. The portions are huge, you always have a doggie bag, and they make your favorite menu item so well that you'll find it hard to try some of the other menu items (but you should, I have yet to try anything here that isn't first rate). the Roasted Chicken hash is my favorite (for the moment).  One thing I particularly enjoy about HHAGG is the excellent micro-brew choices they have. It's not a massive list, but it's an excellent, rotating list, and it complements a lot of the meals really well.    There is always a wait at this place, so plan accordingly. But you know when you see a big line in front of any restaurant, it's usually for the right reasons, and that is certainly True of HHAGG.",

I usually get the same thing every time 'cuz it's so darn good.  I get the omelet or I think they refer to it as a \"scramble\"  but it has eggs, feta cheese and sun-dried tomatoes.  Never had a breakfast that was better than this place.   I am always surprised when I am looking around and I see people ordering cocktails at 10 am but it definitely is happening at the Hash House.   One weird thing is I don't think they bring butter with those huge fluffy biscuits.   No big deal for me as I usually save the biscuit for last and then am too full to eat it.  It's kinda on the pricey side but it is so good that it's worth it.   If you get a chance to order the au-gratin potatoes instead of fries, DO IT.

I uploaded a few pics on FB and got many positive comments on the plating alone!   I had my usual: chicken and waffles. It was definitely not your \"Roscoe's\" variety, but very tasty. Hickory smoked bacon was baked right into waffle, with breaded chicken piled high, stabbed with a steak knife to hold the mountain together,  topped and their signature rosemary leaf.   My husband had the chicken pot-pie; talk about another awe-inspired creation on a plate. It tasted as good as it looked! My brother had their burger. He ate about 1/2 of it, before giving up - it was gigantic!   We all took leftovers home and had them for dinner the next night!  And for you bargain hunters, save yourself $25 with a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon ($25 off of $50 meal)   For more info - check out Travel Channel's 'Man v Food\" (aired 8/12/09) that features the restaurant.",

Banana cinnamon French Toast $11.95 - Not bad and good sized.  Coffee was way strong. I don't mind coffee with a kick, but this was just too much.  The main server was so-so at best. However, the coffee/bus boy was very nice.  Raspberry jam was Fantastic!  Biscuits were dry and chewy.  By the time you add in coffee, tax and a tip we spent just under $60 for a breakfast that just wasn't worth it. I'd rather go to the Egg & I or the Black Bear any day.",

    "text": "So it was my niece's b-Day this last week and i invited her, my sis and my other local niece to Caesar's for some swimming, then brunch followed by a visit to Popcorn Girl and Rocket Fizz.   My sis was worried about the high winds at the pool might make her girls sick - not sure how exactly ; but the bottom line, first on the list is immediately checked off. I know my niece, Lizzie, Loves a good pancake or a good waffle - so ok, back to HHAGG ... please no wait...please good service ... please hot food ... well i'll be damned - 3 for 3 .   Since we've seen a million reviews - i'll keep it short - the highlights:   Bacon Waffles ( pic added ) - i kept staring at Lizzie's plate - 4 large waffles ... please don't eat them all - 1st went down fast , 2nd one almost as quick ...oh-oh ...3rd ...she's starting to slow down ...she's gotta be full after that huge hot chocolate with all those marshmallow's ...whew ...she's done .   But wait, my sis had her eyes on them too ( she had a so-so stuffed burger, i had a so-so hash special - but the biscuit was awesome ! )   we agree to share the last of the bacon waffles - fluffy, nice pieces of bacon in the mix, some whipped butter and syrup - exceptional !!   Highlight #2 - Hamms Beer ( pic added ) - with my special i saw at the bottom of the description - add a Hamm's beer for $1.25 - really ? Hamm's, my beloved college beer of choice ?!? Oh yeah - i'll take that !   Overall, decent service, got seated quickly, and the food - above average - when they say twisted farm food, for me , this place gets me twisted - it's really getting to be a love-hate relationship, today, it was love.",

That hurt but there were 5 of us and only 2 of us were there so we didn't mind getting a head start before they arrived. They called us after 45 minutes.   The novelty wore off when the food didn't deliver. Extra large portions of mediocre food.   *Chicken Salad Sandwich - 3 inch bread with a huge scoop of chicken salad (average) and two huge tomato slices and 2 strips of bacon with a knife and 2 huge sprigs of rosemary sticking out.  It would have been about 7 inches thick if I ate it like a regular sandwich.  The side salad that came with it (or you can get fries) had a really good dressing and after adding salt it was pretty good.   We had people visiting from out of town and thought they would like it because it was on Man vs. Food. But besides oversized portions this place is all hype. The staff is dressed in tin foil and have tin colored paint on some of their faces. That didn't make any sense to me but someone at the table thought maybe because the place had a lot of metal and tin in the decor?   I probably won't return and will NEVER wait 45 minutes (or any time at all) to be seated there.",

We both ordered the specials - mine was a banana, brown sugar & pumpkin pancake.  Every bite was exquisite.  I was soooo happy while eating it!  My husband had something with scrambled eggs, mushrooms, tomato... whatever it was, it was delish and it came with a biscuit that was the best darn biscuit I've ever had.  When it appeared to our very attentive waitress that we weren't going to eat the biscuit, she brought over a peach preserve and butter.  Am I ever glad that she did!

Temperature of food slightly cold.The portions are deceptively big due to breading, fried leaks and overall plating. Sandwiches are piled on thick bread but the protein is not more than standard portion of meats in deli style menus.        Cleanliness: Restrooms had overwhelming odor upon entry, our table was not wiped clean. But we were seated anyway.                                          Service: Server was very attentive. Friendly. Maybe the table touches were a bit much. I suggest determining the guests needs by body language, facial expressions to allow for a dining experience with less interruptions.                                          Value: Expensive. Consider alternatives. $12 sandwiches and entress are $16 or more. About $40 for 2.

Prices were also reasonable to the portion sizes, but I find that to be a draw-back, as I really don't want THAT much food, especially for breakfast/brunch!  Also, now that I am thinking of it, the food was actually somewhat bland  - most notably, the gravy and the potatoes.  I had a scramble which was pretty good though, its just that all the sides went to a waste.  Drinks were good - I had the champagne supernova, which is like a mojito made with prosecco rather than rum, which was good!    Service was friendly when it was there, but the server wasn't at our table very often and we couldn't really figure out WHO was our server - perhaps this is because we were seating in the bar area (about a 20 min F/A wait), I'm not sure.  We were also charged the wrong price for an entree, and decided to speak with the manager - who, sadly, argued with us rather than just talking care of the problem.  Disappointing.  Overall it was decent, but nothing special to make me want to return.",

I do appreciate a restaurant with a drink menu at breakfast, but it doesn't overcome the negatives.  And giant sprigs of rosemary don't make the food haute...it's just an inedible stick on the plate.",

Not familiar with Vegas, we ended up at the M Hotel specifically to eat at the Hash House...of course it had closed 2 days prior...you'd think they'd update their website. So, we drive back 20 minutes to arrive at the one on the strip. Greeted (if you can call it that) by a young man, a host, who looked miserable to be there. Slumped over in a stool at the host stand. Not very welcoming and took our name.   We were seated after a 30 minute wait. Service was rather slow. My husband ordered the sage chicken Benedict which he said was ok. The potatoes on it were amazing. I ordered a bacon waffle which was a sad sad waffle indeed. Not very flavorful...compare to something you'd get at Denny's or norms. :-/   Portions are enormous. I'd rather have a smaller portion if higher quality food. Won't be back.",

Chicks can easily split an order.   \"Twisted Farm Food\" is exactly what this place serves.  Biscuits and gravy: lots of sausage, gravy is smooth and thick. YAY FOR NO LUMPS! Oh yeah, that's served on mashed potatoes!  Hash House Original Benedict: No hollandaise sauce here! Instead topped with a roasted red pepper cream sauce. Yum.   Waffles and French Toast: about 1.5\" - 2\" thick. Serious carb action going on here.   Pancakes: Good luck finishing ONE.   Hash skillets: The guys at my table finished theirs, so yeah, they were pleased.   All fruit is purchased through different distributors only when ripe and in season. Yes, I asked. :-)  Servers have their shit together. They close at 2:30 and re-open for dinner around 5-6pm.   It's worth the 15 min. trip off the strip.",

The hot maple caramel reduction was very tasty and worked surprisingly well with the crispy fried leaks.  Make sure to come hungry and plan to share!",

    "text": "Muslims have Mecca. Surfers have the North Shore. Hillbillys have NASCAR tracks. Everyone has their own personal Holy Land. Mine is Hash House A Go Go.   I started writing yelp reviews because I love breakfast. Now that I have been to Hash House A Go Go I might weep like Alexander the Great because there are no more worthy breakfast places to conquer.  We arrived to a packed house on a thursday mid morning to a packed house. It is always busy. We sat at the bar and introduced ourselves to Randy the bartender, who was cool as hell. While he was super busy, he didn't give a hurry up vibe.   My buddy Bear, (who has eaten Sayler's 72oz steak and fixings, making him my personal hero) stated he was hungry and order the fried chix eggs benedict and an additional waffle. Randy asked him if he was sure because that was going to be a lot of food.  Bear said 'I'm hungry\".  Randy said \"If you finish it all I will buy the waffle\"  Line in the sand drawn, challenge accepted.   The fried chick benny is awesome. Fried cheese. Biscuits. Mashed taters. Eggs. Something green. Heaven. I couldn't finish mine.  One of the guys, Steve, had the most delecious smelling and looking plates of french toast I have ever witnessed complete with fried bananas on top. Indeed it was the Best French Toast Ever because we went back the next morning and I had it.   Back to the Challenge. Bear gave it it a mighty attempt, eventually mixing all the waffle and benedict together and shoveling it in. In the end the waffle got the better of him. Randy said it is the farthest he has seen someone get. He asked Bear who should take the ticket for the Waffle. Like a trooper Bear said \"Right here. I couldn't do it\"  I think Randy appreciated Bear's stand and bought the waffle anyway. It was awesome.    If you go to Las Vegas, get off the strip and try this place. I am looking for a vacation condo near it, so I can live near the Holy Land.",

My husband and I shared the Cobb salad, and the Indiana style pounded pork tenderloin. The salad was literally the best Cobb I've ever had. Adding balsamic and avocado takes it to a whole other level, who knew? HH did! The salad came in a bowl the size of a basketball, which more than compensated for the $14 price tag. The pork tenderloin was to die for. First, the plate was the size of a man hole cover. We are not talking small portions here. The sauce is an amazing mix of tomatoes,cream, and love. It is magical. I could eat a shoe covered in that sauce. The pork was so tender I could cut it with a spoon. (Not that I did, mind you, but I could've.) Our total bill for the 2 of us sharing these two items and a soda pop each was a reasonable $41, and we each had a to go box for lunch the next day left. I desperately wanted to try the cheesecake for dessert but I literally could not eat one more bite. The only criticism I have is that there is not one close to Seattle. I hope they get on that soon.",

After an extended wait to be seated (the hostess wrote my name down wrong) we get to the table and no waiter, finally after about 5 min. Our waiter came by and showed us two plates of chicken and waffles and said he would be back to take our order. He then went on a chicken and waffles tour around the restaurant he came back to take our order. Approximately 3 minutes after placing our order I had chicken and waffles in front of me, wow.  No water, no drinks, and no food for my wife I checked the chicken and it was cold, because it was one of the chicken and waffles that was on tour around the restaurant! After complaining that the chicken was cold the waiter took the ate back. After and additional 20 minutes to get all of our food and drinks out my chicken was over cooked and dry and my wife's chorizo hash was barely passable. I then asked to talk to the manager who when she to the table she informed us that she knew all about what happened and she told the waiter not to do it again. She never once approached us to offer an apology  even tho she was aware of the problem   On top of all that we ordered two BLT Bloody Mary 's in which you are supposed to \" keep the glass\" they said that they ran out of the glasses that we could take home and still charged us full price for the drinks. And all this was on a Tuesday at 11:00 I would hate to see the service on a busy day. Never again",

I saw the other tables with biscuits and when I asked the waiter where mine were at it took fifteen minutes for them to come. Biscuits were nasty and stale. I ordered the chicken and waffles and that to was nit that good. Chicken dry and tasted like it had no seasoning. Waffles had to be drenched in syrup. Wifes meal was bad and my daughters chicken breast was horrible. Again they must have just cook the chicken breast with no seasoning. The only thing that was actually really good was the bread pudding. I will never go back to this place even if it's free it was that bad. The portions are big but if it does not taste good what can you do with it.",

We waited an hour+ to be seated but it was so worth the wait!!!  It was the best breakfast ever and not to mention huge!!! We first heard about this place on the tv show \"Man vs. Food.\" I hear it's a pretty famous place they have lots of pictures of celebrities even Martha Stuart not that's a big deal but it was impressive to see her sign that she enjoyed the food.  After waiting for an hour we were seated and it took a while to decide what to eat there was just so much to choose from and it all looked soo good. On the bottom of the menu it says, \"None of their food is pre-prepared so you wouldn't rush your mom to cook, would you?\" So after ordering it takes another 20 minutes til we got our food, once again it was well worth the wait!! I ordered the mango coconut pancake it was enormous!! It was the size of a large dinner plate and it came w/ potatoes and sausage. My bf ordered the breakfast plate also but w/ a plain pancake, my cousin ordered the skillet hash and my other cousin ordered a stuffed hamburger. All the plates were huge we were in a normal booth and it was covered with food there was hardly any room for our drinks. We could have eaten all this food for breakfast lunch and dinner!! The mango coconut pancake was so delicious they didn't skimp on the mango or coconut and the pancake mix was light and delicious. My cousin's stuffed hamburger looked amazing it was speared with a rosemary twig it looked just those burgers in those gourmet magazines and I hear it was really good also. I had too much on my plate to want more from my cousins. My cousin loved his skillet thing also.   We LOVED this place and will be going back when we're back in Vegas. I highly recommend going just don't go when it's obviously a busy time like we did. When we left around 1:30pm there was still a few people waiting it was that good!! The prices were decent also I think each breakfast place was around $12-15 a person not bad for the quality of the ingredients and the quantity of the food. We went home w/ 3 to-go boxes and ate it later that day.",

One dish is definitely enough for two. My only complaint is that the bloody mary's don't have enough alcohol in them, but that's why you can go and fill up with spirits at the casinos later on.",

I tried a few of their meal options like, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower, which was pretty delicious but it is so huge that the same taste can get a little boring on the taste buds. I've tried the Famous Meatloaf I was not that impressed, I guess you just have to love meatloaf. Indiana Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin, this half a pig steak is a delicious, many flavors that work together defiantly a must try. I also tried a dish with duck breast I don't recall the name of it but I was disappointed the flavors did not work for me. The best and ultimate favorite of mine(and Adam Richman Man v Food) is Andy's sage fried chicken benedict. The perfect juicy crispy fried chicken and is covered by this \"chipotle crack cream\" that I can eat a bucket of. Also all the other food groups are present like spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, tomato, griddled mozzarella and scrambled eggs, and a biscuit, all you need after this meal is a bed. Yes you will keep your cardiologist at his job but once in a while you have to experience a breakfast with a twist and HHAGG is the place for that.",

It was late-night, but the restaurant wasn't busy and this time I was sober and unfortunately recommended it to my group.  Our server was neither good at her job nor friendly.  I had to get up and get ketchup from another table myself just to enjoy my bland breakfast potatoes.  I got a scramble with sundried tomatoes, basil and goat cheese and the eggs weren't tasty and there wasn't enough of the compliments to compensate.  They served me a huge biscuit with my meal, but there was no honey, jam or jelly to be found and I even overheard another customer asking for SOMETHING to go with his biscuit and there was just nothing.  The server made no effort to serve the right food or drinks to the person who ordered, just handed it to us and walked off and then we sorted it out, of course the bills were also a mess.  I won't return on my next visit.",

We ordered the veggie hash, the crispy salmon, chicken and waffles, and the banana French toast. The French toast and the crispy salmon were literally heaven on earth. Everything was so mouth-wateringly wonderful. The portions are also extremely generous.  The reason that this review is four stars and not five is because of the appalling service. Our table was completely ignored by our server to the point where my friend had to get up and ask the front for more iced tea. Lets just say it continued to go down hill from there. I immediately spoke to the manager, Thyrin, to explain my disappointment. He apologized profusely for the servers and appreciated the candor and worked immediately to remedy the situation. As always for me, great customer service is something I always look for, being a manager of a very customer service oriented business as well.   We will be trying Hash House again and hopefully have a better experience.",

We got there about noon and it was packed but still only waited 5 minutes for a table.

I ordered the chicken sage waffles and my girlfriend ordered the banana cinnamon french toast. They were both absolutely to die for.   This is a must for any local or tourist. They have a wide variety of things on the menu and they're not overly expensive. I would definitely give it an 8 out of 10.",

Two people ordered the meatloaf sandwich and they liked that a lot.  Maybe next time I'll go for that.  I have NO idea why it took us THREE hours to eat and pay the bill but it was ridiculous!!!  We called ahead so they knew that we had a large party...why not assign another waiter to our table because one was not enough.  The best part of the meal was the honey biscuits.  But I think they only come when you have a large party because I didn't see them on any other table.  I would come again and try something different.  Maybe a breakfast item would be better.",

However, the line is something atrocious, and I would probably not be likely wait in it again.  Instead, I'd prefer to visit at a less busy time - visiting during Sunday brunch was, in retrospect, not the smartest of ideas.    I did really enjoy my humongous, towering Chicken n Waffles.  I've had large portions of chicken n waffles before, but the monstrosity (based on sheer size) they serve at Hash House A Go Go is really something else.  A big bonus was the fact that my waffles had pieces of bacon interweaved in them.  And of course, I loved that stalk of rosemary that accompanied my waffle tower - it was very much appreciated, since rosemary (even in raw herb form) was perfect with that chicken.  The chicken was good, though a bit more on the dry side than I would have liked.  Other than that, I really enjoyed my meal and I had plenty of leftovers!  My one other qualm with this place - service was slow and our waiter was sort of strange.  We really did not understand his jokes at all, though I'm sure he had good intentions.",

Our son took us there for the first time and we decided to order the Chicken Benedict and the brown sugar banana pancake. The Chicken Benedict was huge and it came with a creamy chipotle sauce which my son loved! The banana brown sugar pancake was literally one of the biggest pancakes I've ever seen in my life. It was covered in cooked bananas and melted brown sugar and deep-fried around the edges but wonderful and pancakey in the center.  I was only able to eat about a quarter of it because it was so big.  I've honestly never had a pancake that good before. When we got there, the wait was about 20 minutes.But by the time we left at 10:30 in the morning, it was a two and a half hour wait. I definitely recommend the Hash House A Go Go restaurant. Just get there early so you don't have such a long wait.",

I like the food, but I don't think it is super special.    Yes, you get huge servings and will almost always have leftovers to bring home, which is a plus, but not enough to make me a diehard HH fan.  My complaint would be that the food doesn't have a ton of flavor.  I have had a lot of different items that always sound good, look beautiful, and have great presentation, but almost always the food is lacking flavor.  Everything is bland to me.  I always have to add a ton of salt, pepper, hot sauce, syrup, or something to add some flavor.  I love chicken and waffles in general, but the chicken here is always lacking seasoning. I do think the Kokomo sandwich is quite tasty though!  I will probably keep ending up at HH occasionally because so many friends are in love with this place.  I will keep giving it a chance when I am there because I like the concept and the idea of the place.  And like I said, I think it is ok, just nothing amazing.",

Even with the obnoxiously long wait, there was no explanation given to our table why it took so long.

Ordered the chicken and waffles and it was massive. My friends ordered their meals and none of them can finish. A returns ordered pot pie and I could have written it as a hat. And my head is pretty big. The waffles came with maple syrup on the side which I didn't need with two large breast cut breaded chicken. The waffles was good but to soft for my liking. I like a little crunchiness in my waffles. The the chicken was really good. Considering it was breast it was very moist and the bragging had some sage seasoning which just elevated it. It's the best chicken waffles I've had. The place itself was pretty cool. It has a unique interior. Somewhat rustic. It was a good way to start our day of drinking.",

    "text": "Bookmarked the Strip location for ages, but every time we attempted at it it was always crowded as shit when we found out they had other locations outside the Strip. AWESOME. LEGGO. It was our final day at Vegas and we wanted to hit up one more joint that's not accessible back home. We decided on this place to end our trip.  We got here and it wasn't too crowded yet, empty tables here and there so I thought the wait time wouldn't be too bad. They offer indoor and outdoor seating and inquired whether I had a preference. Told them whatever was free first (assumed inside since it was open) and jotted my name down and told me 30 minutes, W H A T. Your patio is clearly empty and so is the back of the restaurant. After waiting 30-40 minutes, the hostess and another wait staff placed together two tables in the patio (took you guys 40 minutes to place two tables together outside?) which was confusing seeing as there were tables inside. Mind you, it's 110+ degrees outside.  We walked out and assumed they were going to turn on the misters at least, NOPE. With no misters, the heat got pretty unbearable HELLA fast. We ended up asking if we can sit inside, was told by the hostess it'll be a longer wait (we didn't mind), but deeeng, no need for that exasperated sigh, attitude and look of irritation on your face. We get it, it's THAT MUCH of a hassle to add our name back to the wait list.  Thankfully, we were seated 10 minutes later and got our order taken down. Our waiter was really friendly and VERY efficient. Took our large order like a champ very methodically so that we were served in the fastest way they could. I ordered their \"Healthy Selection\" which was a egg white scramble with choice of two toppings (additional add-ons $1.95) with a side of \"A TON OF\" fruits as advertised on their menu. I got tomatoes, mushrooms and added spinach. The scramble was bland and watery, no flavor whatsoever- It was like eating water. The \"TON OF\" fruits they so wholeheartedly described was just a few thin slices of oranges and 3 pieces of thin apples. The boyfriend got their famous Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and will admit their chicken meat was very delicious, juicy and tender to the taste. Their fresh made red skin mashed potato was a huge hit. Not to mention the portion was INSANEEE. One dish could easily feed 2-3 people.  That being said, 8-10 minutes after we were served, for some godforsaken reason our check was served to us. Our waiter was asking how we would like to pay, we just all stared. Um, W H A T. We barely started eating and you're already rushing us out? We had to double check the front door to see if there was some kind of huge wait, nope. No one at the front. What's with the rush, yo?  I don't know, we wanted to love this place, but taking so long to seat us when there were clearly tables open inside (then placing us outside in the 100+ degree weather), the attitude of the hostess, and the sudden need to rush us out just left a bad taste in our mouth.",

The niche this restaurant has is fresh food in huge portions for a reasonable price. I always order the hot chocolate because it comes in a soup bowl with a monster marshmallow. The pancakes hardly fit on the plate and the biscuits are to die for!   One Saturday we stopped in and there was a theme \"Robot Love\" and all the staff had homemade costumes! It was a fun and comfortable atmosphere.   Try the Sage Chicken & Waffles, it's what they're know for from Man vs Food. You'll never forget it!",

    "text": "So my friend (bachelor) wanted to come out to Hash House A Go Go...he said that this was the original spot...the guys and I were like...ok. hop into a cab and rode all the way over for breakfast.  The taxi driver dropped us off and we went in. There wasn't a long wait in line. We got seated and the waitress took our orders.   The portions are huge. I had the Corn Beef Hash with eggs over easy. It was really big and really good. I didn't eat the biscuit because I was really full. Maybe I nibbled on it...not sure really...One of the guys ordered a Chorizo Hash that looked really good.   The server we had was ok. She was nice but she did miss a few things. She forgot the tangerine juice and my brother got potato wedges instead of the grilled mash potatoes. When we mentioned about the potatoes she admitted quickly that it was already wrong. Makes me feel that she knew already the order was wrong when she took it out but didn't make an attempt to correct it with the kitchen. When she was asked about the mistake it was like catching a kid red handed. Nevertheless she brought out the grilled mash potatoes in a separate plate. So that was nice of her.   Overall I thought the place was pretty good. Yeah it's way off the stripe but it wasn't bad at all.   Here's a tip for tourist that want to go there...either bring a rental car, have a driver's number or take the bus. After we were done we called for a cab and nobody would take the call to come out. We were stuck there for three hours...at least we were at Count Vamp's bar.  Wait...there's a HHAGG at the LINQ? Doh!",

    "text": "This place is sick.  That said, it's sick in the most delicious way possible.  Okay, y'all know me, constantly griping about how many new things I want to try but it's all too far, it's such a chore to get around this city without a car, yada yada, well this is something which I haven't tried yet which isn't all that far out of the way from where I live. I was having Yelp withdrawls, instead of hitting up a usual suspect for the weekend like I have for the past several months, this time I needed to try something new so I had reason to post a new review. I am an aspiring writer you know.   I've heard horror stories about the waits to get seated, but when we came in there was no wait at all. I'm guessing that must be during the breakfast rush, since we came in for dinner.   The ambiance is not what I was expecting based on what I've heard. Outside, it does indeed look \"farm-like\", but the inside is a different story. The front half of the room was very ~hip~, the back half had a more intimate feel. I always thought the interior would match the exterior with the farm theme, but, like the tagline says, this is TWISTED farm food so that could be part of the point for all I know.   And now, I will tell you all why this place is so \"sick.\"  As we were reading over our menus, we were given these gargantuan biscuits smothered in honey. They looked delish, but they were a tad disappointing. They were crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside....until you get closer to the middle. At that point the biscuit gets quite dry, thank god for the whipped butter they give you on the side and all that honey residue on the plate.   My mom ordered the Bacon Garlic-Mashed Potato burger with bacon cheddar mashed potatoes. Although she couldn't finish it, the burger wasn't too insane. The bacon mashed potatoes were AMAZING. They didn't give us any gravy though, but that was good enough by itself, I definitely know what I'm getting next time I go there. The burger was an unusual taste sensation, having mashed potatoes on it. It is quite tasty once you get used to it however.   I ordered brinner: Eggs, smothered in cheese with sausage and crispy potatoes, on top of the Flapjack. Now THIS was sick. So sick. The pancake was the size of a SKILLET, and the waitress even had to hold my plate with two hands. Like I said earlier though, the pancake was sick in the most delicious way possible. I had about 3 bites of it before cutting it up into seven pieces to take it to go for the next day (which would be today. And I still haven't finished it). I was shocked about the potatoes. I figured they would be like hash browns, but they were hefty wedges sprinkled with onions and peppers. Salt and pepper did the trick to make them less bland, but they didn't work all that well as I tried to mix them up with the eggs and sausage. It still made for a tasty meal, and I was almost full after finishing up that.   We were in and out of there in a little over an hour. Talk about swift service. The portion sizes may scare me a little bit, but they are a steal at these prices, and it's always nice to be able to make another meal out of restaurant leftovers.  Delicious food? Great service? Leftovers that are basically guaranteed? I'll be back alright.",

How I sooooo wanted to like this place, but alas... it was not meant to be. The portions are huge, everything LOOKS delicious, but the TASTE of the food itself?? Soooo bland. I ordered the house smoked salmon hash with cream cheese and scallions. My hubby ordered the sage fried chicken with bacon waffles. Everything looked amazing when it came out. Then we tasted the food, then we salted and peppered... and salted and peppered again... then salted again... and salted a little more. Then the food became alright... just alright. Darn! My son ordered the french toast and ate it all, so maybe that's a hopeful sign... although he is into pretty bland foods so I'm not sure. The one highlight was the caramel mocha. That was delicious - thick with whipped cream and heavy with mocha flavor! Yummy!  Would I try this place again? Maybe... the menu is extensive, so there are many new things to check out. I just hope my next experience, if there is one, has more flavor than this visit!",

    "text": "Pretentious.  I have tried to find a better way to describe the restaurant in one word, but that keeps coming to mind.  I liked the ambiance of the restaurant and the menu is definitely interesting, but I was put off by the staff.    In particular, I strongly disliked my server.  I'm trying not to be overly critical out of spite, but sometimes it's difficult to disassociate a restaurant from the people they employ.  For starters, I get it they are going for a particular \"vibe\" with their front of the house staff, hiring people with an edgy look - but my guy gave me pause to wonder if he even cared about his hygiene.    He struck me as snooty, which strikes me as ironic given the identity of the restaurant.  One thing that stuck out for me is two out of our four received our food, then a third came a couple minutes later, then the fourth in our party received his food seven minutes after the original drop off.  I actually looked at my watch and timed it.   When questioned why the food didn't arrive all at the same time, our server let us know with a huff that they don't use heat lamps.  Like, how stupid am I?  I should be grateful that our food is coming out like this because they are way too clever to use a fundamental kitchen appliance that almost every other restaurant utilizes to ensure even service.    So, while it might be nice that my food didn't get a bit dried out under the heat lamp, it wasn't so great that it got cold because I didn't want to be rude and eat while a member of my party had not received his food yet.    As for the food, everyone did enjoy what they received.  Portions are generous, presentation is nice, and the prices are reasonable given the quantity you receive.",

    "text": "When you first walk in, the ambiance was nice..........high open ceilings painted black with lotsa ceiling fans going. The hostess didn't come off as very friendly when they greeted us.  I didn't get a sense of friendly welcome.  We were told it would be about 10 minutes, and the entire front section were all empty tables (10 tables).    I figured out after we were sitted that that section just opened up during the time we were dining, so that's why we had to wait.  and their waiters were very nice, friendly and they were always filling our water up.  It was one of the best ice cold water we had.  The coffee was very good too, and they were always refilling that too.  Everything is made to order and served when it's done.  I ordered the corn beef with crispy potates and sunny side up eggs.  It was a large portion and served with fresh slice cantaloup and pineapple which was very good.  The corn beef were shreded and mixed with cheese over crispy potatoes.  It was A+, the only thing I would have liked was that the potatoes could be cut a little smaller, otherwise it would be perfect for me.  The biscuit was large and flaky and I spread their fresh homemade strawberry jam on it.    My dining partner ordered the vanilla waffle...................it was about 12\" x 12\" and was very good.  I make waffles at home and I thought mine were the best, but this is right there too.  The portions are large and everything is freshly made to order and it's one of the best breakfasts to go to.       We went on a weekday around 9am, so it was too crowded, but the place was full by 10am.  I would recommend this restaurant.",

If i was voting for service i vote 5 stars for the manager chris, but 3 1/2 stars for the bartender who made the lattes.  We ordered carmel lattes, being that we are spoiled san francisco latte drinkers we are desperately looking some place who makes good lattes. (Las vegas is over satuated with starbucks and once you have REAL coffee SB doesnt cut it any more...dont get me wrong SB has its place aka fraps). Well the lattes here to be warn makes you feel that you didnt get your cups worth. Its $7.50 for a carmel latte, and trust me if it was awesome I would gladly pay AND come back often, but the espresso beans here is not yummy.  The cup is filled to about a bit less than 3/4 which instantly makes you feel cheated. Not sure if its their practice, but just a warning of feelings.  And the Plus the amount of carmel and milk this bartender combined did not make it a creamy just well not sure how to describe.  However after mentioning this to the manager chris, we were immeadiately taken care of. We were not made to feel guilty one bit . In fact his customer service was perfect  ! He's a real asset to the company! Now I havent tried the bartenders alcohol drinks, but shes definately not a latte maker. Her personality made you feel if you questioned her about her drink making skills she would instantly tell you to f$@& off hahaha! So overall come for the food, skip the lattes.",

Enormous portions of amazingly awesome food for pretty darn reasonable prices.  2 issues I have though - 1 there is no cell service up there at The Quad location.  That made it very difficult to communicate with our party and we kept having to run all the way out to the Strip just to get a signal.  I think they should invest in a cell service booster.  Service was pretty slow too, but it was understandable because it was soooo jammed, because of the awesomeness.",

Our waiter recommended the Sage Fried Chicken with biscuits and cream chipotle sauce - need I say more? We also shared the biscuits and gravy. The gravy had golf ball sized chunks of sausage in it!!! It was absolutely to die for. I ate it for breakfast, lunch & dinner that day and again the next day for breakfast & lunch & I STILL had left overs. Definitely worth the price for the amount of food you get. I will definitely be returning to Hash House!",

    "text": "While we were disappointed we trekked all the way out here ($15 cab from strip) and it wasn't a strip joint meets Amsterdam coffee house, the brunch was memorable.  We ordered a fried chicken eggs benedict and a banana cinnamon french toast.  My friend had seen a Man vs. Food episode here so we were expecting the dishes to be on the large side.  We revised those portion estimates upward when we saw a flap jack the size of a small pizza go by our table.  The fried chicken eggs benedict was massive and interesting to say the least.  They've taken a lot of liberties in calling this an eggs benedict.  The eggs are scrambled instead of poached.  The hollandaise sauce is replaced with a delicious chipotle cream sauce.  The English muffin is replaced with a massive (and fairly tasteless) biscuit.    The fried chicken (perhaps 2-3 pieces worth) under this heap of toppings was delicious.  Also loved the garlic potatoes and apple-smoked bacon that was in there.  The eggs were just so-so but at least they made it feel like brunch instead of some gluttonous hangover binge.  The french toast was just so-so.  It's huge but size doesn't help when you order something that sweet.  I wouldn't recommend it.  The wait on a Saturday morning was 45 minutes.  Pretty impressive (and annoying) given that it's not on the strip.  Not sure I'd make the trek out here again but it was worth a one-time visit.",

    "text": "Having seen the restaurant on MVF, I knew I had to make it a stop if I ever got to Vegas.  I spent the last week there for a family gathering, and kept trying to find some time to break away to get there.  I told my wife that we WOULD be going on our way out of town.  We got there at about 10 am on a Thursday.  We walked right in and there was no wait to be seated.  The ambiance is cool, and everything seems like it was well thought out.  It was clean, and the staff was very friendly.  I ordered the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict.  All I can really say is, do it.  Eat this magnificent blend of flavors and textures.  Come hungry, it's a beast... but you will leave with a smile.  The fried chicken is juicy, firm, and the breading is light and subtle.  The hint of sage really adds a lot.  It might be the best fried chicken I've ever eaten... but that's a tough call.  The griddle mashed potatoes are excellent.  They get the texture perfect, and they are just the right amount of salt.  The chipotle sauce on the top is great also.  My wife had the meatloaf and eggs breakfast.  The meatloaf was delicious.  It was not mushy or runny or falling apart.  It was a firm patty, neatly grilled to a delicious brown crust.  Served with the griddle mashed potatoes, she really enjoyed it.  (And I enjoyed the leftovers.)  What really speaks to the level of service at this place is the experience my mother in law had.  She has celiac, and cannot eat any gluten.  She made her allergy known to our waiter, who took the time to double-check with the chef about what dishes had flour.  She settled on a scramble that had asparagus, pot roast, cheese, tomato, and obviously, egg.  She remarked that the vegetables were very fresh and everything was cooked to perfection.  Other recommendation:  Get a S'Mores Mocha.  Wow.  Overall - it was worth the wait.  And given that I paid with my craps winnings, it was the right price.  Stop by if you're in Vegas, San Diego, Chicago, or anywhere else they open one of these.  It's worth the time.",

    "text": "Rickilane's thread has reminded me that I have in fact been back for breakfast and I'd say it's just \"A-OK\". It's not worth the wait. It doesn't live up the hype (ok portion sizes do!). Service blows, but overall the food is decent and if you're a quantity over quality type person this should be right up your alley (sadly I'm not!)  Let's start with what they do right - the DRINKS! The coffee drinks. The mimosas, the bloody mary's, OMG. Divine. We had a sickenly sweet smores coffee drink with flipping marshmallows melted on the cup.. bonus points for creativity. I have yet to try a drink here that isn't scrumptious!!  We ordered one of the egg platters. It was decent. Nothing memorable, but nothing wrong with it.   The chicken and waffles is where this place goes incredibly downhill. For those that say the chicken is flavorful, I think you don't have tastebuds. The chicken is so bland, dry, and awful. The waffle was somehow also bad. I love bacon waffles, it's not like this place is the first place to have them (get them all the time at Original Pancake House), but the execution here was WAY off. The bacon wasn't small enough so you have major texture issues giong on. The waffle overall lacked that yummy sweetness you get from most waffles. It wasn't soft, it wasn't sweet, it basically tasted like dry white bread with huge pieces of extremely thick flavorless bacon in it. HUGE disappointment. We kept covering the plate with more and more syrup but there was no rescuing this pitiful excuse for chicken and waffles.   My hubbie is from Georgia, I'm from TX. We eat chicken and waffles in the south all the time. We're familiar with how they should taste. Roscoe's in LA does an excellent freaking job. This my friends was the worst chicken and waffle execution I've ever encountered.. Crappy chicken and a crappy waffle?? WTF Hash House.",

Everybody knows that waffles and bacon has got to be the most amazing combination ever haha! The waffles were fluffy and moist. Their chicken was fried but not greasy. It was tender on the inside and it goes great with the whole meal. Definitely a sweet & savory meal for sure!  They don't take reservations during the weekends so there is typically a 10-20 min wait around breakfast time which is not bad at all. It's definitely worth the short wait. The servers get pretty busy so you might not get your drink refill instantaneously. Parking is also a pain sometimes. I suggest one person to get out of the car and put your name on the list while somebody finds parking ;)  Oh their watermelon lemonade is pretty good but I don't think it's worth the $5 honestly. It's not refillable and there's more lemonade taste than watermelon so just a heads up.",

I ate a gargantuan Pepper Jack Twisted Burger and I don't have any regrets. The burger was loaded with the aforementioned pepper jack, tons of guacamole, Hungarian wax pepper, jalapeno bacon, and queso cheese sauce. The combination was hearty, distinctive, delicious and spicy. My only quibble would be a less well done patty, but that didn't stop me from devouring the whole thing.   It was happy hour so of course I had to have Cuba Libres, they were perfectly mixed, not too strong, delicious with a solid kick.  The decor is stylish, modern, and hip in a rock n roll way. The service was friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable. They anticipated my wants to perfection. Wonderful afternoon snack!",

You have a pick of covered outdoor seating with fans, indoor tables, or extra large super comfy booths.   Staff-Our waitress was knowledgeable and extremely helpful with the vast menu selection.  Now I love country homestyle chicken salad(the kind you can only find at church pot-lucks and 4th of July BBQ's. in the south) I rarely order chicken salad from restaurants because it's never seasoned quite right.... When I saw they had  Fried Green tomato & Chicken I decided to put HH to the test making a traditionally southern dish that is best made at home. I was blown away! The presentation was stunning. Chicken salad and fried green tomatoes layered a mile high on top a juicy slice of watermelon !! It was plated like fine dining and taste like your gram-gram made it. HH is really on another level you have to experience for yourself!   Hats off to the entire staff!!",

It was a mountainous portion of food so I didn't finish, but it sure was tasty. We haven't visited in a long time but this food is great. You get a lot of food for what you pay for. Funny thing happened... My father-in-law got mad at the size of his plate though and asked the waitress why she delivered his food on a ridiculously sized plate. He still ate and enjoyed his breakfast.  There is plenty of free parking at this location and it's off the strip so it's a little slower pace.",

The combo was chicken, eggs, bacon,  creamy potatoes, tomato, biscuit, chipotle sauce on the side, and a slice of melon. Both were equally delicious and very very filling. One plate could easily feed two people. This place is quite popular so expect a wait, and being that it is usually packed the service can be a little slow.

I figure I'd give this place another chance, but the food was just okay once again.   I ordered the fried chicken penne pasta since I had already tried the fried chicken and waffles. Highlight of the dish was definitely the chicken. They got the batter, seasoning, and juicy chicken down. The downside was how the pasta was overcooked and you don't get much of it. It turns out that they placed half an apple in my dish since it was the base to hold up the chicken. So at first it looked like a good amount of food for $18.99, but that illusion quickly gets dispelled once you dig into your dish. The sauce of the dish was okay, nothing too special about it.   If I ever go back to a Hash House, I'll probably try another dish with the fried chicken. So far the waffles and pasta has been a miss in my book.",

Ridiculous doesn't even begin to describe Hash House A Go Go.  Adam Richman, of Man vs. Food fame, has been here. That should tell you plenty.  We came on our way to Zion. I'd heard of HHAGG but never experienced it. And I'm not sure if I need to come back.  We were seated immediately near the bar by the patio.  Our server, Izzy, was great.  We all started with waters and drinks: screwdriver and chardonnays for the drinkers, iced tea and soda for us non-drinkers.  The cups are huge so you shouldn't run out of drinks the first go around, unless you are really thirsty.  Ok, so the meals. We walked by a plate with the tractor driver combo (2 eggs, bacon, flapjack)l, and that pancake was HUGE. The burgers were so big, the bun looks like it was minaturized.  Since we didn't want to be big blobs while driving, we all chose the smallest menu items available. I chose to have the basic which was 2 eggs (overhard for me), crispy potatoes, a biscuit and bacon.  My fiance had the baby burger as it was the smallest burger on the menu and he loved it.  Our other dining companions had the basic with smashed potatoes and over easy eggs and a fitness scramble. All of our food came with random rosemary.  We were full from even that! Everything was delicious and big so come here hungry or when you want a cheat day.",

Plus we waited a long time to get through the payment process after we finished. The food was good but really not that tasty which was a surprise for corned beef. The best part was the carrots and potatoes. I have had better experiences and food at other Hash Houses.",

It seemed like the perfect time or the perfect location since we sat right down and our food came out very quickly.   Before we ordered our waitress had warned us that the portions are HUGE and she was not exaggerating. Everything that came to our table was beyond gigantic.   I split my order with my coworker and we ordered the Sage Chicken Eggs Benedict. I have never really had Eggs Benedict so I don't have much to compare it to. It came out on the most giant plate and even splitting it, we could not finish the whole thing. The bottom was their famous mashed potatoes which were to die for, layered on top was a row of biscuits, on top of that was a mix of fried chicken, bacon, tomatoes, and some greens, all ok top of that was scrambled eggs and their amazingly delicious holindase sauce. The sauce had a spicy kick to it making it the best sauce on a breakfast concoction I have ever had. The rest of the menu didn't seem too adventurous for me, but I am in no way a breakfast person, so I might not be the one to trust on this one. But what I had, I was very pleased with.",

It's like comfort food on steroids! The staff was peppy and bubbly, it helped create the whole experience; however, my last visit was quite different.       The place was very empty, not jam packed and hopping like I had remembered. The staff seemed very uninterested in any incoming patrons, standing about gossiping, it seemed. Our waitress was very unenthusiastic and delivered very lackluster service. She may as well have been asleep. My husband, sneakily, mentioned to our waitress it was my birthday... She stuck a candle in my entree. Ummm..??? It was odd to say the least. It was definitely not the same upbeat hustle and bustle place I recalled.      Our first visit, every staff member that interacted with us was so full of life and seemed excited to make sure patrons had a amazing experience. They seemed genuinely passionate about the customer experience. They definitely got you pumped up about the huge, amazingly prepared & visually astounding, portions of fatty food you were about to consume. The second visit lacked all of this. Our waitress probably would not have cared of we walked out... That stale.       The food was okay, not as good I remembered. Honestly I would probably not return. It is an experience of you have not dined with them at least once. It is huge portions of comfort type foods with a twist, very cleverly crafted, like you have never seen. Your first trip, you will be wowed just by presentation. Hopefully the staff at this location will spunk things up a bit, not so walking dead.",

However, I recently had mouth surgery and asked the hostess if it was okay if I ordered from the kid's menu since I couldn't really eat much and didn't want to waste food.   She said no problem and gave me the menu. I ordered my food from the waiter and again, no problem. Then, moments later, I was told I could not order from the kid's menu and that I need to pay full price. It was as if I was trying to cheat the system - clearly not - I've never ordered from a kid's menu in my life... not even when I was a kid!   I felt like I was going through an interrogation as I was pushing the issue from ordering from the kid's menu. (\"Who told you it was okay?\" \"What did they look like?\" \"Can you point them out?\")   I could have easily said 'fine' and just ordered from the normal menu, but it was the principle. A few minutes later the hostess came over and profusely apologized as if she got reprimanded and told me that \"just this one time it was okay.\" I said the as fine as I don't plan to have routine mouth surgery and them dine out - but it was Easter so I met my family on my lunch from work.   Again, good food, but this was poorly handled and a little embarrassing.",

Service is good by the servers. However, the reception/host people aren't very nice nor helpful. I've been to this location a few times & have received snobbish treatment by the hosts.  Despite this, I'd still come back here since I love their food so much. They can get busy & wait can be long. So, either avoid peak times or wait! It's definitely worth it!",

Make sure you mix the drink or you'll get a big gulp of kiwi flavor and its pretty sour! Once mixed together, it wasn't as sweet as expected. My sisters ordered a non-alcoholic version of this drink and it tasted much sweeter   Huckleberry Sin: not super sweet, can't taste the alcohol much but I definitely felt it!  Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles: Looks really impressive but the taste didn't live up to the hype. The chicken was alright but the skin kept falling off and wasn't very flavorful. The waffles had bacon inside and those were yummy! Shared between 2 people and still had leftovers.  Griddled Portabello Mushroom: the top bun was too hard so I ended up eating it open faced w/a fork & knife. The mushroom acted as a patty and came w/roasted red peppers, spinach, basil pesto & goat cheese. A great vegetarian option but not as satisfying as an actual burger.   Overall, the serving sizes are generous and we all left with stuffed tummies. All the food is picture worthy but there was a pro & con to each item ordered.",

Good - The breakfast food is great with gigantic portions, good food, and a myriad of choices to suit your cravings.  The service every time I've been here has been excellent. They have always strived to make the dining experience shine. Their knowledge of their products and their friendly yet professional demeanor are very high pluses. Edmund, our waiter, was great at explaining everything and keeping us happy.  Okay- the dinner menu isn't the shining star of the restaurant. I feel as they go for quantity but in doing so the quality of the food is shot, not greatly but still noticeably.   Bad- there want anything I found bad.

We of course ordered the gigantic Benedict and I must say 4 people can share one, be full, and still have leftovers. It was amazing. Not only was it huge but it was delicious. My favorite part of that meal was the burnt cheese they put as one layer of it. It's amazing and their mashed potatoes makes me want to lick my fingers.  We also ordered their brown sugar hot cakes and that was the biggest pancake I have ever seen int entire life. It was soooooo good too. So flavorful. She brought it with bananas on accident and although I don't like bananas they tasted great. The only one complain I had about this was our server. I don't remember her name but excuse my language she was very bitchy. She made it sound like she was doing us a favor by bringing our food out with is odd because usually Vegas restaurants have the best service ever. I think u should totally make this someone u should try next time you're in Vegas",

    "text": "I love this place, but I don't like it. It wreaks havoc with all my good intentions to eat little, and eat healthy. There's not a dietitian alive who'd condone a dinner of mounds of deep-fried chicken piled atop FOUR, count 'em four Belgian waffles, garnished with more than a few strands of fried leeks, unless you count the sprig of fresh rosemary as a green vegetable.  That's hubby's favorite dish at this spot, which bills itself as \"Twisted Farm Food.\"  The best I can do in my Perpetual Diet World is the Stuffed Meatloaf, and I love it. Two slabs of meatloaf, with cheese, fresh spinach, and tomato stuffed inside, atop a mound of mashed potatoes.  The bonus is fresh green beans, which have the cooked-but-crisp quality I love at Chinese restaurants, and carrots.  I can continue to be delusional as I dig in!  I always order this dish without the marsala cream sauce, but whichever server I have always brings it on the side anyway.  The dish doesn't need it, and I sure don't need the calories.  My cousin dipped a pinkie in the sauce and pronounced it bland, so I'm sure I'm not missing anything.  And the double bonus is that I have enough of the meat loaf left over for a substantial dinner the next night!  We usually come to Hash House when we have out-of-town guests, because it something our [East Coast] visitors can't get at home.  This time was no exception, and it's a hoot to watch their reactions when the food is brought out, either to our table or surrounding ones.  Even we gaped at a foot-high dish at a nearby table, and couldn't figure out what that pile on top of a slab of watermelon was.  We found out later that it's the Fried Green Tomato appetizer, and we marveled at that couple's ability to polish that off and continue on to main courses.  It looked fabulous, but I don't think we'll ever be ordering it.  One thing I take exception to here is the wine list.  They've crossed the $7 line as their least expensive glass of wine, and at $10 and $12 a glass for my coveted Rieslings, I vote with my wallet.  As non-Strip eaters, we're not used to paying these prices, and I missed my customary wine with dinner.  Still, HHAGG will stay on my bucket list for our visitors, and we sure get enough of 'em.",

The wait was very short we waited less than 5 minutes before being seated.The food was so delicious! I ordered Banana and Pecan French toast with scramble eggs and amazing breakfast potatoes (yummy). Everyone was pleased with their food no complaints!",

    "text": "\"Farm food with a twist\"...that's right!   It's like, wow. I am speechless cause I'm too busy stuffing my mouth with amazing goodness! My oh my, the food here is delicious and the servings are huge! I can see why the servings are big because when you work on the farm, you're gonna need a lot of energy to burn. However, when in Vegas, you'll need the food to feed that hangover!   Came here on our last day in Vegas (and no, we were not hung over) to experience all the buzz everyone is talking about. Ladies and gentlemen, you were all right! We got here a few minutes right when it opened so we didn't wait long and were seated immediately. They don't take reservations, but it seems that on Sundays at 8am, there is no line! Anyway, the hostess was friendly and the place looked clean. Our server was friendly and gave great recommendations. She was honest about how much food there was and she also informed us about plate serving and local faves. Great customer service!  I got the HH Original Benedict and loved it! It's Eggs Benedict on top of mashed potatoes filled with bacon! It's a dream come True (fluffy potatoes with bacon)! And the red sauce was sweet with a touch of hot sauce. I only finished half of my meal and took the rest home. We shared a side of gravy and it is just as amazing! It was warm, creamy, and had sausage chunks! It complimented the bread & biscuits we ordered. I love the coffee here! Our server told us it comes from California but forgot to write it down. Oh well.   I was stuffed by the end of the meal! I had to walk around for a bit to make sure digestion was happening and to ensure I make room for the second half later! Definitely a place to try farm food that is twisted!",

    "text": "After reading so many positive reviews, we decided stop here after the mall. I had read some reviews at the mall of so the hype was definitely set. When looking at the picture this place for me seem like \"comfort food\" with a twist. When we pulled up to a near empty parking lot we knew we did not have to to wait for a table. The hostess quickly seated us. The menu was massive and t took me a good 2 or 3 minutes to figure out where to start. Our server according to our receipt was Jay. He quickly took our drinking order and was prompt on service this evening this is a bonus. Our waiter brought out the drinks and offered us complementary biscuits big portions. For Hash House A Go Go \"big portions\" is a complete and total understatement. WARNING this place has monster size plates of food leaving the kitchen! This is not the restaurant to be eating with your eyes.   Now, let's move onto the food quality. We had a total of four dishes the first  is the Hash House Meat Loaf Pasta. It had charred tomato, basil pesto and crispy parmesan cheese. This pasta was an a decent dish but my taste for pasta has changed since I went to Italy. Pasta in the United States is unable to compete with it. The Slow Grilled BBQ Pork Ribs was amazing. I highly recommend this dish. The ribs are braised with a house soy BBQ sauce and served with mashed potatoes. The ribs was tender and the meat just fell off the bone.The potatoes was the only disappoint on this dish since is was dry. The Kokokmo, is meatloaf with tomato and griddled smooth mozzarella cheese on milk bread. Reminded me a lot of a mozzarella grilled cheese sandwich with meatloft. It took an extra couple of minutes for the last dish to arrival comared to the other dishes for some reason. The last dish was the Famous One Pound Stuffed Burger. We had the hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar it comes with two patties with lettuce tomato and red onion. The prices were a little higher than I usually like to pay, but once we saw the plates of food coming out it didn't matter anymore. The presentation of all the dishes was well done (picture will be posted soon).  Highly Recommend the Kokokmo and Slow Grilled BBQ Pork Ribs. So if you are planning to eat here Get hungry and make sure to wear some sweatpants!",

    "text": "Hash House A Go Go was another restaurant my sister really liked, but she had tried the one in San Diego.  Being buffeted out, we wanted to grab breakfast somewhere different, the mister and I decided to try Hash House A Go Go.  They have several locations in Vegas, but we decided on the one on Sahara since it got the better reviews.    This location is a few miles away from the strip, but the place was packed on Sunday at 9:30A with both locals and Californians.  Must be a good sign.    Our party was 4 + a baby, so 5 in total.  They said that it would take about 20-25 minutes and I was prepared to wait, but the mister was antsy and wasn't really feeling the wait.  He was set to leave, when low and behold, they called our name.  That was only about 10 minutes.  It was our lucky day!  The food gods wanted us to try the joint.    We were seated at the booth, which fit the carseat w/ my baby, me, and the mister on one side and the in-laws on the other side.    Looking over the menu, there were some very interesting selections.  Although I knew I should try the hash since it is part of their name, I went with the Snickers Flapjacks...I've never seen that as a pancake choice before.  The mister ended up getting the chicken hash w/ asparagus and the in-laws shared the salmon hash.  I order my mister the watermelon kiwi lemonade.  According to the waitress, it was the most popular non-alcoholic drink.    Our food arrived pretty quickly and our waitress was friendly and checked on us frequently.  My flapjack was HUGE!  It was very yummy.  The Snickers were melted throughout the pancake, it was better than a chocolate chip pancake and it wasn't too sweet either.  My mister's chicken hash tasted very fresh....much better tasting than the hash at Hash at the Hotel Erwin in Venice.  The salmon hash was pretty good too.  Even the watermelon kiwi lemonade was awesome.  The drink is in three layers...top layer is the kiwi, middle is the lemonade, and the bottom is the watermelon.  Very creative and so refreshing!  I was impressed with Hash House A Go Go.  Yes, I am a fan!",

Something that caught  my attention was the decor, as it matches the theme of the restaurant. The staff is friendly, but should try accommodating guest better. They have these fans on at all times plus the AC, so even in Vegas weather, it is really cold in the dining area. We asked if we could change tables and it was like if we asked if we could leave without paying. So we just decided to stay were we were, and even though our food got cold due to this we enjoy our meal and took the leftovers.  Overall, make sure to come hungry and ready to take a bag with you.",

Their servers are tatted up & also express themselves through friendly conversations. However, I dont recommend their chicken & waffles or going to the Imperial Palace location. Hash house offers alcoholic drinks & plenty room for your group, so why not try this featured Food Network joint?",

I ordered a cappuccino,  2 eggs over medium, bacon, and their HH special pancake that had banana and pecans.  The cappuccino took about 20 minutes to come out so I finally asked for some coffee - this is the sole reason this review isn't a 5 star.  That long for a cappuccino is a bit silly - it was early and not at all too busy yet.  My waitress was cool and gave me a quick cup of coffee on the house to tide me over until my original drink order came.  Once I got it I was thrilled with it.  The food came and it was a wow moment as the pancake is pretty spectacular.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, bacon too was spot on but it was the pancake that was the star.  The banana in the pancake was caramelized and unbelievably delicious.  I just think about it and start to drool.  So, so, so good.  Probably also about 3000 calories but it is so good it is worth it once in a while.  I know I said I would eat there every weekend - good thing I don't live there!  Husband loved his perfectly cooked scrambled eggs, bacon, and buttermilk pancake.  Yum!  Would definitely recommend and would definitely return.",

For all you \"What Would You Do?\" fans, the Hash House served as a backdrop for many of their scenarios. More famously, they are known for being on Man vs. Food. And unless you have an appetite like Adam Richman, I suggest you bring a friend to help you eat the madness that is \"Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict.\" It is to die for! Chipotle cream with peppers, scrambled eggs, griddled mozzarella, fried chicken, bacon, market tomato, spinach, and biscuit on top of griddled potatoes. This is literally the best breakfast I ate in Vegas. If you're a fan of country fried chicken, this is right up your alley. MUST. EAT. NOW. Check out my photos if you need inspiration.",

Just like the other location in SD, the staffs are very nice and friendly people! It must run throughout the Hash House chain eh? Awesomeeee. Love our waiter! We came after 11:30AM and it was a tad crowded but they seated us maybe after 15 mins or so? It would have been 45 mins if you were in SD so I'm grateful for that!  Since we loveeeee our dish so much from the last time, we ordered it again this time. Andy Sage Fried Chicken ($16). It turns out it's the guy's favorite dish also from Man vs Food. Must I warn you that this dish can fill up two people? Even then, we couldn't finish it, yet we were STUFFED till maybe for another week or so!  The dish was very very similar to the one in SD, but not quite! I like it but I could tell there was something different about it. Instead of bacon bitz, they placed the whole bacon with it, which didn't taste so good. The grilled mozzarella and fried chicken were both delicious! I'm not sure what else to it but overall, it was good! With that said, it was nice to have Hash House again though! Great place for breakfast when you're in Vegas! It IS off the strip but I can't imagine how other places would taste like with the 3.5 stars, when this has 4 already.",

I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit dish and it was soooo good.  Real bacon, tasty sticky maple syrup, and juicy fried chicken...also, they throw in a few crispy bacon strips on top of the fried chicken.  The kid's chocolate pancake was ridiculously huge...probably 12 inches in diameter.  My 6 year old and 2 year old barely could eat a quarter of it.  It was nice they gave them plastic water cups and crayons/paper to keep them occupied until the food came.  Husband ordered the corned beef hash and it came out in a skillet.  He said it was delicious too.  The only thing that I didn't like was the coffee.  It tasted pretty bitter but the waitress told me they brew their coffee strong.

    "text": "Twisted Farm Food....that's pretty accurate  My only regret is I am not actually a cow, with the four compartment stomach and the ability to ingest 2.5% of my own body weight, which for me would be 4.2 pounds. If you do the math, you can figure out how much I weigh!  I couldn't finish my brunch here.  I was defeated by a loaf of meat and mashed potatoes.  I'm actually somewhat glad I didn't attempt the chicken and waffles, because my wife did, and she ate exactly half, so we decided the next time we come here, we would just split one, that way we can both feel accomplished in our eating endeavors.  Gargantuan proportions...Just look at those pictures!  The food doesn't come on plates; here, they come on PLATTERS.  Seriously consider whether you should donate a portion of your meal to charity.  Sage fried chicken and bacon waffle tower.  It wasn't that architecturally sound, but at least it looked and tasted great.  Bacon baked into the waffles, 2 pieces of crispy and NOT greasy chicken breasts on top of the waffles, with delicate fried leeks strewn about the plate, and a giant sprig of rosemary holding it all together.  Usually comes drizzled with syrup, but we asked for it on the side and they were happy to do that.   HH meatloaf with mashed potatoes.  Pretty much like normal meatloaf, but crispier and meatier(not meteor).  You know how meatloaf usually comes with either gravy or ketchup on top?  Hash house does it with BBQ sauce!  They are seriously changing the meatloaf game...The dish also came with the biggest biscuit I have ever seen in my life.  It was about 4 and a half fingerbreadths tall and about 7 inches around, and perfectly \"biscuit-y\".  You know what I mean?  A good balance of flakiness with fluffiness cut with a pinch of butteriness and saltiness, all in equal proportions.  I kind of love biscuits.  I had a bloody mary to accompany my mini smorgasborg of a healthy brunch.  It was well made, as far as bloody marys go, and came with a garnish of a petite dill pickle and 2 jalapeno stuffed olives.  Props - Great food, tip-top service, good bloody mary  Negative props - SERIOUS FOOD COMA.  We'd planned to partake in all manner of adventure after brunch, but Hash House decided to ruin our plans by knocking us out with the force of a cast iron pan a la Tom & Jerry for about 4 hours.  We woke up and the sun was gone.  Does that properly demonstrate the power of Hash House a Go Go?",

This place is always high on our lists of places to hit up every time we head to Las Vegas. Usually there is a long wait, but that usually gets erased by the great service and food. Well... this location needs some major help.   I ordered Andy's Sage Chicken, and my wife had French Toast.   We arrived around 1200 so we expected a slight wait which would be normal. Well we ended up watching 2 groups of people, with the same number in their party as us, get seated before us.   After we got seated we waited about 15 minutes for our server to come over. She seemed bothered by simple menu questions we had about the special items. Then wanted to rush us into ordering and we had yet to be asked what we would like to drink. We then asked for a Diet Pepsi and a Mountain Dew. Well she retuned with 2 Pepsis and we kindly asked for what we ordered and she seem disturbed by this. She brings us the drinks and then vanishes to other tables and stops servicing our table. We sit with empty glasses and no service. After a few minutes a different server tops off our drinks and then my food comes out 10 minutes before my wife's. So my food is getting cold. Finally my wife's French toast comes out (I guess that's a difficult dish to make). So nobody checks on us to see how we like the food. We got just 1 refill. The front of the house lady dropped off our bill and we payed and left.",

It can get pretty packed with people who saw it on TV, so a wait is something to consider.   It's fun to check out once, but I would rather have a normal portion of a really good dish, than a giant portion of something that's more around a B- or B.",

    "text": "What an utter disappointment!   My friends and I drove over to this joint on a recent trip, excited about the prospect of a delicious breakfast. We should have saved ourselves the time and stayed at the casino buffet!  First off, the lunch items we saw being delivered did look good. And by good, I mean tall. They stack all of the food really high here, with a big sprig of rosemary inexplicably stuck in the top of everything. It's so impressive that my friend asked a neighboring table if she could photograph their burger. Anyway, we didn't order lunch, but maybe we should have. Maybe that's their specialty. Because it sure ain't breakfast!  My friend and I each got a different kind of Eggs Benedict. Hers came doused in marinara sauce for some reason. Wtf? I ordered the smoked salmon florentine and they chose to smother this one in something that looked and tasted like Thousand Island dressing. The salmon was not like any kind of \"smoked salmon\" you are imagining. It was dry and clumpy, with a texture like it had been served three days prior as an entree and then nuked and reconstituted for this dish. There were also long twigs in the potatoes - what? I am not making this up. Look at some of the photos on this page! They put twigs in it on purpose! And the whole thing was topped off with that giant rosemary sprig, sticking out of the top like a g*d*amn Christmas tree.  I love breakfast. Fancy breakfasts, greasy diner breakfasts, you name it. But this...this was disgusting. It is rare that I can't find something on my plate to eat, but this was simply inedible garbage food. I don't think I've ever given a 1 star before, not even in Edinburgh!  To cap it all off, we had to wait about a half hour to get our check, even though we were all prairie-doggin it hard.  On the plus side, they played great 80s and 90s music, and my friend liked her mocha, hence the 1 star.  If you MUST come here, try the lunch?",

Since I like to take the red eye from Honolulu, I am often on the hunt for a nice breakfast when I land in Vegas. My usual stop is Bouchon, but I thought I would try something different on my most recent trip.  I'm an Eggs Benedict kind of gal, but when I go to a restaurant, I like to try what they're known for, so I opted for the Sage Fried Chicken on the Bacon Waffles. My mom ordered a Crab Cake Benedict, which was a special, so I figured I could steal some bites from her plate.  The presentation of the chicken and waffles is impressive. However, it looks a lot better than it tastes. The chicken was quite bland. And although I tend to like my pancakes and waffles on the dry side,  the syrup container seemed really tiny to me. I considered asking for more, but I felt a little ashamed. :p The idea of bacon in waffles is a good one, but the execution was lacking. I think maybe the waffles were not crispy enough.  My mom's dish was a lot better, and I sort of kicked myself for straying from my usual. The portion sizes for both dishes were gigantic, so if you have a big appetite, this is a great place for you. Service was friendly and efficient. Overall, I'm glad I went once to cross it off my list, but I am not eager to go again.",

I wasn't impressed, but it's a chain so it's what you get. The service on the strip in 100x better. I really do like the sage fried chicken and waffles and the corned beef hash.

    "text": "Wow...where do I start with this one!!!!  My friends & I went to Vegas to celebrate my birthday and had a list of food places to hit...Hash House A Go Go was definitely #1 for Breakfast.  We rounded up everyone and headed over at 10:00 am.  For Vegas, we were shocked to see there were so many \"Early Birds\" waiting for their tables.  We had a big group of 10, the wait time was just under 15 minutes.  As we were waiting to be seated, we kept seeing the servers bring out MOUNTAINS of the same stuff.  What caught our eyes were the amount of food on one plate!  Wholey Moley....if you thought Large meant LARGE....you'll change your mind when you come here!  We got seated and ordered the following:  01.  Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles ($14.95) - 5 Stars Two sage fried chicken breasts w/ hardwood smoked bacon, waffle tower, hot maple reduction & fried leeks. (surprising the BEST & YUMMIEST part of the dish)  02.  The Tractor Driver Combo w/ Blueberry Flapjacks ($11.95) - 4 Stars Two eggs w/ bacon (Simple but \"Out of this World!!!)  03.  Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese Scrambles ($10.25) - 5 Stars All served with griddled mashed or crispy potatoes, fruit & fresh biscuit. This dish was so delish, we were quite \"melted\" by the flavor the Goat Cheese had on the eggs and Basil.    04.  Indiana Favorites ($12.50) - 4 Stars   Griddled HH Meatloaf & 2 Eggs served w/ mashed potatoes, fruit & biscuit.  05.  Hash House Farm Beneficts ($12.25) - 3 Stars HH Original w/ smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, roasted re pepper cream & topped w/ 2 basted eggs.  06.  The Tractor Driver Combo w/ Brown Sugar Banana w/ French  Toast ($11.25) -   4 Stars Two eggs w/ bacon, Griddled French Toast dipped in a banana  cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup.  07.  Mango Coconut Flapjacks ($7.25) - 2 Stars Pieces of Mangos & Sprinkled Coconut Shavings served with Maple Syrup.  08. Griddled Cheese Sandwich ($10.95) - 3 Stars Cheddar Cheese served with a choice of fries....Such a great comfort food.  09.  Fresh Squeeze Tangerine Juice ($3.00) - 5 Stars Excellent Squeeze!!!!  10.  Whipped Cream Hot Chocolate (6.00) - 5 Stars This is the \"Mother\" of all Hot Chocolates...simply will put you in a \"COMA STATE\".  So worth it but NO refills.  11.  Cafe Latte ($3.00) - 5 Stars One of the BEST I've ever tasted...SO HEAVENLY!  All 10 of us left SUPER FULL, SUPER HAPPY & SUPER SHOCKED WE ATE EVERY ON OUR PLATES!!!  I'm making sure I go there every time I'm in VEGAS.    NOTE TO THE WISE - Get there before 11:00 am or the wait time averages 1 hour.  But even then, it's so worth the WAIT.",

    "text": "After having ate at this restaurant at the M Hotel and Casino yesterday and sharing the experience with my girlfriend she was anxious to give it a try.  Rather than drive all the way across town we opted to visit the one a little closer to us.  My girlfriends review is right below mine. Her name is Karen. Although it is very detailed and accurate. I'll add a few things.   She gave it four stars so apparently she was a little more impressed than I was.  We each ordered one of their fancy drinks off of their drink menu. Both drinks were overly sweet and really just not that tasty. I do admit they both looked great and we did keep the souvenir glasses as they looked pretty cool.  I felt that the wait time for our food order was longer than needed. Strange as this is the same complaint I had about the one I visited yesterday.  I ordered the blackened chicken and she ordered the pot pie. As usual the portions are humongous.   Both items arrived piping hot. All of this is good but again I found the food to be only satisfactory. It'll definitely fill you up and it was tasty enough. The presentation is terrific. ....... but again I just don't fell the urge to have to visit this place again.  I'd recommend other places before recommending this place.  The check was around $60.00..  Again we had a overall satisfactory experience. Good and hot food. Friendly staff. Clean environment.  Something just keeps me from giving this place more than 3 stars.",

The eggs were cooked as I ordered, the potatoes were over cooked and tasteless. The pancake was huge and cooked well, but average in taste.  All in all my meal was average.  Hubby got chicken and waffles.  The onions and sage and thyme all combines with the waffles and syrup and it was interesting and good.  The fried chicken was good too.  Although he enjoyed his meal, at the end his option was still \"meh\".  Izzy at the car helped us and she was nice and fun and gave good service.  There was a male manager (I forgot his name) he was really nice too.  Other employees- not so impressive, like the young complaining about Melissa or Marisa who no longer worked there.    All in all this is just one of those places that try to win with quantity because the food just isn't all that good.",

The huge portions are overwhelming and you really don't want to eat more.  I had the fried chicken benedict.  It was ok, but nothing to write home about.  The chicken was good, but the rest (aside from the bacon), really didn't work well for me.  I didn't like the chipotle cream sauce they used either, country gravy would have been awesome.  In sum, it's good to try, but I really wouldn't go back.",

Nice work Tommy!   So apparently Adam Richman from Man V Food was here and ate their Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict!!! And of course he won, Adam can eat anything!! So Andy's Fried Chicken Benedict here we come.. this thing is delicious! The hollandaise is beyond creamy and rich in texture. The Fried Chicken is well done, but still juicy. Then there's a layer of spinach, tomato and bacon, biscuit, then home made mashed potatoes. It's totally worth the try. Huge portion but you can always share.  The bacon bacon bacon is so candied and sweet! It's a perfect marriage of sweet and salty!   Drinks: of their best seller is the Johnny's Famous BLT Mary. To keep the souvenir glass it's $17.99. I got the Deep Eddy Mimosa $6.99. This thing is good; it has a bit of cranberry vodka, tangerine juice and champagne. Imagine that a mimosa with a shot of vodka! Only in Vegas right.   There's parking right out front especially at this location. Restrooms available.",

There seemed to be some type of car show going on in their parking lot and you had to squeeze your way through a big group of guys blocking the pathway and entrance to even get in.(We debated even going in at all.) The food ended up being pretty good and our waiter was awesome. The portions are huge so we were too full for dessert and decided to take a $10.00 slice of their banana cheesecake to go. When we got home and decided to eat it we were surprised to find that the cheesecake tasted like onions or garlic or possibly even meat? We ended up throwing the whole thing out. I'm not sure if the cake was spoiled or had just been stored uncovered with food that it shouldn't be stored with, but it made me question everything I had just eaten there.",

We got the chicken and waffles (of course), the chicken fried steak and the chicken pot pie.   The chicken and waffles was .... OK. I liked that the waffles were stuffed with bacon (husband didn't), but the fried chicken part was... just OK. They use chicken breast (versus thigh) and the breading didn't have much flavor.   I don't know about the chicken fried steak, because my husband loved it and ate it all (in 2 sittings, as we brought it back home). I tried the biscuit and gravy it came with and it was very very good.  Bacon-y gravy, by the way. Not that anything is wrong with that.  The chicken pot pie, in my view, was a fail. It has.. broccoli and spinach. And the sauce was just downright runny and weird. Nothing about it tasted like chicken pot pie. Cute \"presentation\" but that was the best part.   We'll give it another chance and some other stuff, hoping our first visit was an off day.",

A friend of his told him about it and how big the portions were.  The initial service when we went to put our name with the hostess was barely worth 2 stars. They were pretty busy so granted the girl may have been stressed but nonetheless she was rude, short & frankly put a sour taste in my mouth. Not a very good first impression. We were told it would be 45 min because we were a larger party bit we only ended up waiting around 25 so we were quite pleased.   Our server introduced himself to us fairly quickly and took our drink order.  As for the service overall, he did a good job in flipping our annoyance into a good time. He was attentive, informative and friendly.   Our food came out quickly as well. All I can say is once we saw the food, we understood the meaning of \"huge\" portions. The food looked like artistic work, we didn't even know where to start on some dishes.   The Benedics are overly large, but we found that it was all really just a bunch of carbs layering the whole bottom. Most of the good stuff was on the top And the sauce didn't even go to the bottom so needless to say we didn't really eat it.   Waffles were delicious! I want to try the bacon waffle next time.

Then I ordered a side of the fried potatoes, thinking that they would come out like the same potatoes that were on my friend's plate, potatoes came out nothing like my friend's plate. They were dry and over-cooked and didn't come with any scallions/onions or anything. The bacon bacon bacon appetizer would've been good if it were hot or even warm but no they serve the bacon cold/room temp.  The fried green tomatoes were good though. This was my 1st time coming to this location and I will not be returning. I suggest that if you want to go to a \"Hash house\" go to the Henderson location. I've never had problems with the food being prepared properly at the Henderson location.",

Both were pretty good. My husband ordered the salmon egg scramble and a burger which were both delicious! We had come in during the busy brunch time on Saturday but our waitress was wonderful! Got our drinks and orders put in quickly and checked on us to make sure we were doing well.  Second time, I went with my mom and brother. Again, we were seated right away but no one came to our table for a good 10 minutes. The woman who was supposed to help us didn't acknowledge or even look our way once even though she was serving the table right next to us. The gentlemen who did end up helping us after seeing me get a little impatient was very kind and quickly got us our drinks and our order. Although we were there around almost 3pm and there was only 4 other tables with customers, they seemed understaffed still. It was our waiter and the other waitress but they seemed to be all over the place.  Our food was still very delicious and although this visit wasn't as amazing as the first, our waiter still do a good job and definitely saved the day.",

Our server was friendly, attentive, and had a nice sense of humor. It didn't take long for our food to be served.   Looking at the menu, it seems like it's a bit pricey.. But when the food comes out, you'll see that the servings are HUGE. Like, not even kidding. I forgot what it's called exactly, but I got a single party burger with cheddar cheese and bacon cheddar mash potatoes. Everything was cooked well and tasted good. But I was a little full having just snacked a little while earlier. Before our food came out, they gave us HUGE biscuits with honey butter and and some kind of peach jam. OoOh carbs. The honey butter created a yummy glaze, I asked for more on the side!...   The hash house in my hometown is crazy busy.. So it's cool to eat here without getting stuck in an 1hr + wait list...",

It was post lunch time and the place was not busy yet we waited 15 minutes for a coffee and hot chocolate and only received the cold hot chocolate. Had to send back to be heated. My coffee was lost in the shuffle and had to be brought out later. The food arrived in a timely fashion and was hot and tasty. We ordered the menu staples of Fried Chicken Benedict and the pork tenderloin sandwich. Both were phenomenal and with a great sized portion. I just wish the service was more attentive and efficient. The employee sweeping asked if we needed anything and I asked for the check. He apologized and explained that our server was really overwhelmed with tables. I looked around and did not see that many occupied booths or tables so I didn't understand his explanation. All in all, food was great and highly recommended for hose looking to try something different but hopefully you will have a better experience than we did.",

We ordered the traditional bacon and eggs with a choice of french toast or waffles, and meatloaf...food was okay. French toast was drench in syrup and a grilled banana on top which made it soggy. Next time, I'll stick with my chicken and waffles.

Oh my gosh... their servings are HUGE but definitely worth it. One plate can definitely be shared and I highly recommend sharing one!   I ended up order the crab cake Benedict I believe and my boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles. Both plates were amazing but sadly they were both too big for us to each finish our own. This waffles were lightly crisp and the chicken was very juicy and wet and not dry at all! My crab cakes Benedict was amazing, the eggs were poached perfectly where the yolk would still be runny.   Only downfall was that our sever took awhile to do refills on our drinks and check up on us if we were okay.  Other than that, I'm actually really glad that we tried this place out because next time we head to Vegas for vacation again, we're most likely going to come back here for their chicken and waffles again. So if you're looking for a nice place to eat with big portions, come here, it's worth the price you're going to pay!",

There were three other people waiting on tables who kept looking at us but kept turning away and acting like we weren't there. Our waiter was polite and helpful and checked on us after taking our order from time to time (another star). Food portion was huge as always and delicious (another star). Our waiter was still the only one to acknowledge us as we walked out of the restaurant. It felt like they didn't want us there. Maybe because we didn't look like we had money or maybe because we are a blended family. Whatever reason it was, I'm not eating here again at least at this location. Someone told me that the staff here are racist. I didn't believe them. Now I have to re-evaluate that.",

I also tried the meatloaf which was really good, even though i am not one for meatloaf.   lastly, but certainly not least, the FRESH MADE peach cobbler was to die for. its worth the wait.  i'll be back!",

    "text": "Well, I broke my own rule and tried this place again. I am so angry at myself for doing it. I could have gone to The Peppermill and really enjoyed the fantastic food and the whole Vegas feel of the place. But I didn't. I went here instead and got the same thing I got last time I was here. Pre-made warmed over tasteless mush.           It shocks me that they tell me i can't substitute anything because it will compromise there dishes. Now, how the hell do you tell someone that and then refuse to allow eggs over easy after 11am? Completely ruins some of the dishes that need the yoke to make the taste and keep it moist. Scrambled eggs in the salmon Benedict turns it to dried out crap. Just floors me every time i think about it.          I ordered what used to be my favorite, the Andy's sage fried chicken eggs Benedict. This is a rather complicated dish to make and it took them less than 5 minutes to bring it to my table. Can you say pre-made? No way are they cooking this to order. The chicken is a full breast of chicken with Corn flakes and a few other things on the outside then deep fried. This takes much longer to fully cook than about 3 minutes.           When I took the first bite it was just how I remembered it the last time I was there. Luke warm, mushy, rather tasteless crap. This place has literally dropped right off the scale as far as I'm concerned. It used to be absolutely fantastic and now I would rather microwave a frozen low cal dinner than to eat here.             I was with my mother and she ordered the biscuits and gravy. What the hell happened here? This used to be excellent and now it actually tastes synthetic and rubbery. My mom only finished about half of it and could not stand anymore. This WILL be my last time eating at Hash House. The Peppermill is absolutely fantastic every single time and they don't skimp on anything. That is where you will find me at breakfast time from now on. Really to bad how they ruined such a good thing.",

Once we arrived there was a mob scene of about 30 people waiting outside and the wait was an hour. No biggie, I'm a patient person and I'll wait for food if it really good. Luckily, the wait went by fast so we got a table and ordered away. I went with their infamous chicken and waffles while my brother and dad went with the french toast and brown sugar banana flapjacks. It's safe to say we all Loved our food. The chicken and waffles were very different, a lot different then what I'm used to(Roscoes) but it was equally as delicious. The dish came with two giant pieces of juicy fried chicken and four waffles with bacon baked inside???  The waffles were good, but when combined with the chicken it was perfect. I also really really liked the french toast. If you like bananas, I suggest that dish because it is amazing. The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that. Luckily I am a big eater so I was able to finish my dish and sample everyone else's to get the full experience. Now Hash House a GO GO will be a definite stop everytime I come to vegas.",

The wait for a table was about 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad.  Our waitress was very attentive and took good care of us.  I started with a blood mary (YUM!) and my hubby had the mocha latte - both drinks were very good! The bloody mary was spicy and adorned with jalapeno stuffed green olives.  I ordered the sage fried chicken benedict and my hubby ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich.    To say the portions were obscene is an understatement.  The portions were ridunculous!!!!  Mine was less ridunculous than my hubby's - the pork tenderloin was three times the size of the bun!  Why add the bun?  Seriously.  There was no way in hell that anyone could have picked that thing up and ate it.  At any rate, the chicken breast on mine was delicious, tender and juicy.  It was a mountain of food, to put it mildly.  I ate the chicken breast, cheese, eggs and bacon - I had no room at all for the biscuits, spinach and mashed potatoes underneath it all.  I believe mine came with a side of shame and guilt because I felt like crap the rest of the day.  While our food was very tasty and worth the wait (they do make everything to order, so be patient), it was too much food for 4 people, let alone 2.  For the love of God, if you go, order one meal and share it!! Yes, they charge you $2.50 for a split plate, but who cares?!  It's a small price to pay to be able to enjoy the rest of your day and not be in a vegetative state!!",

    "text": "Yea, we basically only knew about this place, and came here because it was on Man vs. Food, and it looked good... so one Wednesday morning, me and my boyfriend decided to try it.   I got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, and it was freakin HUGE. I mean it looked big on the show, but it also looked GOOD... and it was. Definitely no disappointment, but bring your appetite. It was a little overwhelming, and maybe a tad bit too much chipotle cream sauce,   My boyfriend got their pancake breakfast, and that was huge was well. The thing that knocked off their star was that it was raw in the middle. Don't get me wrong, there was still PLENTY to eat even after he picked around the raw part, and they were really nice about it, asking if he wanted another one (like I said, still plenty to eat), so they just took off $7 from the bill. The thing that gets me is that if your going to make gigantic pancakes, make them right, or make them smaller.  I don't think we would go back together, but I'd probably bring my family or friends here when they come into town, cause the service was great, and friendly, and it is kind of a novelty since it's been on national TV.",

Good place to go to once in a while, but nothing I would crave often. Overall, a good dining experience and good food. Would definitely recommend everyone try this place out at least once.",

The quesadilla is loaded with cheese, eggs, mashed potatoes, jalapenos and other yummy stuff. They have an amazing creamy-chili cheese sauce to dip your quesadilla in. It was sooooo good. So good that I honestly didnt even want to try anyone elses dishes... but, I couldn't resist, and Im so glad I didnt resist!  My husband ordered the Griddle French Toast. It was to die for...to die for. Definitely will order this again!  My girlfriend ordered the Andy's sage fried chicken salad. She really liked it. I tried a piece of her chicken and it was crispy and flavorful on the outside, and the inside was juicy and delicious.  Her husband had the grilled portobello mushroom sandwich. It was also really good.   We ordered all kinds of alcoholic beverages which were really good, but unfortunately I can't remember what I ordered.   I was really pleased with everything we ordered here. The portions are so huge that its probably a good thing that its located in Vegas, although there is one here in San Diego...hmm.",

    "text": "If you've never been to Hash House a Go Go, you have to go.  It will flabbergast you and fits in with excessiveness in keeping with the Vegas tradition.    I've been to the San Diego location many times, and on a recent group trip to Vegas, knew my LA friends would get a kick out of coming.  This location differs in from their SD location in that there is way more parking available and the restaurant is much bigger offering more seating.  Other than that, everything else is the same.  Humongous portions, special entree and drinks menu, cool bar area to sit and enjoy some drinks, friendly servers, etc.  Everyone in our party was extremely satisfied with their experience hear and I heard a few of them returned back the next day.  You would do very well to share one meal for two people, especially if you're visiting Vegas and don't have a fridge for leftovers.  If you don't share, things can turn south if you're like me and hate to leave uneaten food on your plate.  Of course I overate, but it's Vegas!  The standout seemed to be the pork sandwich, although I thought my sage fried chicken was really enjoyable.  Their \"special\" mocha was really really good, but only if you're a sweet tooth person and prefer your mocha to be more hot chocolate with a dash of coffee.  If you're a person that upholds the standard of coffee, it would be best to stay away from that mocha.  Service was friendly and fairly fast for the most part.  The wait is the worst part and unfortunately it's no better than the SD location.  They don't take reservations and if you have a large party, you better be ok with sitting at separate tables if you want to have any chance of eating.  They broke us up into 2 tables for a party of 16 and we still had to wait about 45 minutes.  We got here around 11AM, but come at 10AM I think they didn't have a wait at all.  So if you can manage to drag you butt out of bed early, it'd save you some time.  The food is usually very good, but in my experience can sometimes be hit or miss.  Sometimes meat is overcooked and if I want to get picky, the amount of carbs they give you is just plain ridiculous.    Overall I was very pleased with the meal and the fact that everyone in my party enjoyed themselves really confirms that Hash House a Go Go is a place we'll probably stop on by every Vegas trip.  Price: $15 - $20 per person depending on what you order and drinks. Food: Very Good Service: Very Good Ambiance: Very Good Location: Very Good",

And she did not leave any of us disappointed at all.  Any who we walked in without making any reservations, waited about 10-15 minutes to get seated which I didn't mind at all because we were a party of ten.  Food was honestly really good but I wanted to try there chicken and waffles. Ended up going with the corn beef and Swiss cheese hash (about $15.00) because me and my other half wanted to share. Portion was huge and more than enough for the both of us to finish so we had leftovers to take home. Corn beef tasted really fresh and of course I had to have my potatoes extra crispy and eggs over easy. Nothing to complain about.  Overall place is pretty big inside, the menu has a huge selection/variety of dishes, service was great for a party of ten, but if I'm ever in Vegas again and I end up here I will most definitely have to try there famous chicken and waffles.",

I received my order a full 15 minutes after everyone else despite having ordered the simplest thing on the menu (sausage, egg, potatoes). My eggs were overcooked and pathetic. See picture.  My friends were not impressed with their orders, either. Pancakes were overcooked and tasteless. Waffles were not crisp and were soggy in the middle. And all of our potatoes were rock hard.

Each meal is big enough to feed 2 or more people do go hungry and don't go if you're on a diet!   On my visit I got the mixed berry with granola pancake. It was amazing.

First and foremost we did not get offered a booster or high chair when we had a party of 5 with an obvious toddler.   I had to go find a high seat for myself and on bringing the seat over, the front of the house staff \"girl\" walked up and said \"Sorry you cannot have a seat here it is a fire hazard\" and just stood there staring at me. I had to ask if there was something else for the child. She said a booster and still staring at me I then had to say \"Ok go get a booster seat and you can have the high chair\" before she left to go get one.  I mean seriously why seat people at a table knowing they cannot have a high chair when you can clearly see the toddler in the party. Why not inquire from the group before hand if they will require a high chair or booster and seat appropriately. She however stopped to pickup two kid menus for the kids. Does Hash House A Go Go not cater to kids or this was just an unmotivated front house staff? Or did she have a problem with my family? Who knows and who cares. But dear readers with families please consider this when you plan on visiting this establishment.  Cheers...",

It was sprinkled with cinnamon which put it over the top! Didn't leave hungry that's for sure!!",

The hot chocolate is the kind you buy at Walmart and mix with water. Everyone knows a good hot chocolate needs to be mixed with milk. The topping though was really good - melted marshmallows, a graham crackers and some extra chocolate drizzle and powder. Sweet.  I ordered the Apple cinnamon pancake (huge! The photos are legit). However, there was barely any flavor. Even the apples didn't hold a lot of oomph behind them.  The bacon is good - not cheap bacon. And the eggs weren't watery - so that was a plus. But again, stuff I could easily make at home.  Missed the mark unfortunately. 3 stars because while not bad... nothing was \"good\". Average.",

Food was definitely what I would call edible. Not bad in any way. For me, not enough for me to return. Lots to choose from off the menu. Ambiance was similar to bar.  Big tables available for groups.   Good service, clean place, fun looking food. Flavors nothing to write home about or return for.  Wouldn't go out of my way to return.",

Even though I don't like waffles at all, the presentation and reputation of the chicken made me want to go. In fact I've been twice - once in Florida and once in Vegas.  I am definitely done trying this restaurant/dish. The chicken is bland and has too much breading. I love leeks, but the fried leaks come out dry and don't add much. I skip the waffles. As someone who loves fried chicken, this is a disappointment.  Restaurant/service were fine, friendly. Menu diversity seems good, but none of the dishes I had were. My appetizers were ok but nothing to write home about.  Maybe you will like, but this is not a place I can recommend.",

My scrambles was okay, I can do the same at home but I didn't want to do anything different for that reason of me not liking it. It also smelled like sweaty armpits throughout the whole restaurant which was a turn off. I wouldn't go back, and as in recommending - I don't know to each is own.",

It was very tasty and it was my 1st exp. with chicken and waffles which i missed out on when I was in LA b/c i stood for 3 hrs in line for Pink's. argh. Anyway everything on the menu sounded so good. i havent been back b/c i'm trying to trim down and let's face it going to hash house is kinda counterproductive to that goal! but oh so good!.  One thing i thought was the strangest thing. they have the smallest shortest water glasses I've ever seen, but they consistently came by to refill them so it was ok. I just thought to myself...why not invest in taller glasses?",

What about quality? While I wasn't wowed by the taste, I won't turn my nose up at it. It definitely did not leave me wanting.   The service was some of the best I've experienced.  Thanks Kelli B!

    "text": "Was on another Vegas adventure and wanted to meet up with some friends for lunch.  They said, \"Let's go to Hash House.\" Of course, I am not one to say no to a place I've never heard of, so we went. :]   When we arrived during the lunch hours on that hot July Saturday, they said it would take up to 45 minutes for four people to be seated. RIDICULOUS! But, I was told it was worth the wait.  About a half hour later, we were seated and the menu was... insane.  I honestly had no idea what to select because everything sounded so...heavy.  I decided to go with one of their Saturday lunch specials - the Fisherman's Lunch.  It was a calamari steak sandwich and seafood sounded much lighter than double patties or chicken wrapped in eggs wrapped in only they know what!  When the food arrived, I was in shock.  The servings are HUGEEEE.  I would recommend that people who are faint of heart to try and split something with another person.  Not a single person at my table cleaned off their entire plate; there was just too much!  The calamari steak was DELICIOUS.  I've never had anything like it before and it tasted WONDERFUL! The only problem was that the sandwich was so huge I had to take it apart just to eat it...which ended up being messy and leaving me with a calamari steak salad with very fresh croutons. :] As good as it tasted, I could not finish the entire plate! I even came in quite hungry!   Additionally, I had a taste of Andy N.'s chicken and I must admit... that was some pretty damn good chicken.  Our server was a bit...eh. Nothing too exciting there.  He wasn't terrible, but he wasn't spectacular either.  Overall, GREAT FOOD with HUGE PORTIONS! They have so many twists to classic favorites, and it's an adventure for you mouth! (Who wouldn't love that?) It's definitely a place to try out, and I'll definitely be heading back another time to tackle (try to tackle) something else! :]  *side note: I found out later that this place was also one that was featured on Man v. Food.*",

Anyway, my boyfriend and I came here on our laziest Monday morning to my recent memory, which is kind of the only mood to be in to eat stuff like this. I ordered the HH Original, and he got...some things in a skillet (meaning, usual eggs, etc.). First of all, the portions frightened me before they delighted me. The presentation of the food was  not bad per se, but made everything look sort of \"hodgepodge-y,\" like, \"Hey, let's see how we can make all these different shapes and textures lay on top of each other.\"  That aside, the food was good, for me. My suddenly-a-food-critic date said his order turned out to be a pile of potatoes--of course not literally.   I think it's definitely worth a recommendation and visit should you be nearby.   Also had lots of leftovers...a plus or minus depending on how fussy you are.",

The atmosphere is so neat- I love the whole farm to table thing and it has this whole hee haw meets hipster vibe which I dig.  Our waitress didn't have a name tag on. She was attentive, my one complaint being the level of food education she has had. Example: I asked that the eggs be dairy free. She says, \"the eggs have no dairy added but since they are eggs they are dairy. Is that OK? They are dairy\". I think if you make a big deal about your food your wait staff should know a thing or two, amiright? Food came out and we were shocked. Chicken and waffles were HUGE. Pancakes, HUGE. Scramble, pretty big. Lots of food!   Hubby ordered the spinach cheese and ham scramble. It came with a biscuit and honey dew, and he opted for the fried potatoes.  I got the sage chicken and waffles.  Littles got chocolate chip pancakes. The tiny one got the eggs I mentioned above. Hubby: \" the blandest most boring meal I've had in a while. I could have made it at home. The potatoes were just plain. It reminded me of hospital food\" (side note: he is really easy to please breakfast wise) Me: taste. Salt. Taste. Salt again. I dug in. Was it different? Yes. Good? Yes.  At 16.99, though, I would have preferred less food more flavor. It was so bland. I gave hubby a bite. He was like. Wow that's really bland. So it wasnt just me lol.  Kids loved their pancakes. Given. Their favorite pancakes are from IHOP. But no complaints. They were huge! We could have had them split.  The tiny one's eggs were cooked perfectly. No dairy except well.... According to the waitress they are dairy. Hmm..  All in all, this place could have been 5 stars. I just can't because the food was really really bland. I probably would give it another try though, could be just a cook issue.",

    "text": "Wife and I went to the Sahara location this past weekend 6/9/12; I had been to this location several times, this was her first time at any HHaGG.  I have learned to stick with the chicken and waffles, as I always tend to regret ordering other things on the menu.  Not that the other items aren't good, it's just that the sandwiches, skillets, etc. are on par with other breakfast places.  The chicken and waffles here are IMO the best item on the menu, and the best I've had in town (compared to M&M, Gritz).    As previously stated by everyone else, the portions are HUGE. We knew this, and decided to share this dish, and ordered a side of biscuits and gravy (actually, only 1 biscuit). The menu suggests a $2.50 split plate charge, but the waitress just brought us an empty plate, and we did it ourselves for free!  Good times.  The biscuits and gravy are VERY good, but VERY rich, with chunks of meat and creamy goodness that fills the little bowl.  The biscuit is soft, flaky, and resists soaking from the gravy well, giving you a nice consistent texture, without mushiness.  I dare say the FLAVOR of the biscuit and gravy is now my favorite thing at HHaGG. The problem is it so rich, I would find it hard to make a full meal out of it.  Sharing a side is the way to go for this gutbomb!  Even splitting, we still left a waffle (sans bacon, of course) behind.",

The food is great and portions are huge. Odds are you will get two meals out of it. We tried a burger and the chicken and waffles, both I would recommend to anyone. I will definitely be going back for more if this place next time I'm visiting Vegas.",

At first you will say that is not enough food, but boy they do fill up for sure and it is big portions on sme of them. The food is affordable, but wow $6 dollars for orange juice is quite a bit, but worth it. The place was a big cold were we sat however which was not good.  I would come back again.",

    "text": "BREAKFAST ORGY!  Those are the words I use to describe this place to my friends and family...at least the ones that are ok with the word orgy.  I made my first trip here 3 years ago after seeing the man vs food episode and now it is an absolute must on every Vegas trip.  I was there for the week of the 4th and hit it up on the 4th...and the 6th.  Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict is my go to when I have to split with my wife.  When the shackles come off and I can order whatever I want, there's no telling what I'll get.  I'll list a few that I've had:  Chicken and Waffles: SHARE THIS.  It's two big pieces of chicken paired with waffles that have bacon baked into them.  I've never come close to finishing but wished I could.  Blackberry Granola Pancake: I was embracing my inner tree hugger and it was delicious.  The berries explode all over the pancake with patches of granola baked right in.  If you like those flavors, get this into your mouth asap.  Corned Beef Hash: Order this if you like actual corned beef and not the dog food that comes in the Hormel can.  It's served in strips, almost shredded, in a skillet with eggs and potatoes and a buscuit.  Coulda been something I'm missing, but it's all about the corned beef.    Banana Pecan French Toas: Take a big ass banana, split it down the middle and cook that bad boy up.  Now pair it with some of the best french toast you've had with pecans also invited to the party in your mouth.  If you want some serious sweet for breffas, do this.  DRINKS- I've been wanting to order drinks for a while now.  I always fixate on the food and skip the exotic drink menu. NOT THIS LAST TIME THOUGH.  Smores Mocha: Are you F'n kidding me?  First it comes in an oversized mug (surprise). It's a mocha which marshmallow fluff on top that's browned and then garnished with two pieces of graham cracker.  It's very sweet, so I'm not sure if it's an option, but an extra shot would probably be the only recommendation I could give to make this any better.  Caramel Mocha (?)- not sure of the name, but it comes in a tall glass that makes it look like a shake because it's topped with a bunch of whipped cream which is toped with drizzled caramel and chocolate.  Like the above drink, very tasty, but very sweet.  I like my coffee STRONG, so I'd add an extra shot next time if possible.  I believe there are at least 4 locations in vegas, The M, The Plaza, The Imperial Palace and this one.  I like this one because it's a free standing building well off the strip, so I avoid a little of the Vegas madness.  It gets packed pretty early.  If you think you're going to sleep till 9 and show up and get a table at 10 like every other lazy ass, you're mistaken.  You need to COMMIT TO BREAKFAST, wake up early and show up as close to opening (i believe it's 7:30am) as possible.  If you go to Vegas and don't eat breakfast here, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.",

Plate by plate files by you of simply gorgeously displayed craftsmanship on a plate. Does it match up to the visual when it comes down to taste? You betcha! And beyond.  A towering stack of waffles and sagely spiced fried chicken, mounded with fried leeks (Do I eat leeks? I do now!!!). Added an order of scrambled eggs, which it seems silly to say but they were truly the best prepared I can remember. The two of us shared the waffle creation and had more than enough food.  The second Saturday of the month apparently they have this rousing DJ that sets everybody rocking to breakfast. Fun, inventive, artistic food with an attitude and a joint making a statement of swinging for the fences. Loved the experiance and the food!",

Hash House is five star all the way. The food, the ambiance, the servers, the drama! And you guys are reviewing it like it's just some other diner! It's been a few months since my visit, and I am really craving this place.   This location is off the strip, and caters to the locals. I am sure they also see their share of tourists, that like us, rent cars. If you are vacationing without a car, I am sure there are more convienent locations.   My advice if you are eating here? Come very hungry! Bringing a large group will also come in handy so you can try a bunch of stuff. We were a group of 6. This is the kind of place where you end up ordering more from seeing what's coming to other tables, than from the actual menu. First thing to catch my eye was a HUGE mug of hot chocolate! Gotta have it! But will it be good, or is it just razzle dazzle? It was amazing! Next I served myself from a couple of the skillets that arrived at the table. These are one of their specialties, and they were really good. We're talking potatoes, eggs, and then a bunch of different items you could choose to go in there. Honestly, I don't even remember what was in there, because the pancakes came! Once the pancakes came, everything else was history!   These were not your ordinary pancakes. These were OMG, eyes rolling to the back of your head, I'll have what she's having, died and gone to heaven pancakes. Hands-down, the best pancakes anywhere, ever in my life. There were sliced bananas and brown sugar cooked into them. The brown sugar was melted and carmelized with the bananas, and it all came together in one ooey gooey heavenly dish. Now under the influence of these pancakes, I was unable to even try anything else on the table.   I know one thing; my next Vegas trip...it's straight over to Hash House right from the airport!",

The food display is very appealing, the gigantic portions easily adds to the obesity epidemic in America, and the service is fast and friendly!  Andy's Sage Fried Chicken (w/ spinach, bacon, tomato, mozzarella, chipotle cream, and scrambled eggs)-  THIS THING IS A BEAST. Definitely enough for 3 people because everything is so heavy and flavorful. Every component of this dish was quite good on it's own, but once it's all mixed together, it's kind of a big mush of crazy flavors. Pleasing to the taste buds, but you get kind of tired of eating it after 15 minutes, and there seems to be no dent in the pile of food.  Definitely a fun place to try when you're in Vegas, but is it one of those places you MUST go to every time? Nah, just try it once or twice to see how much food your stomach can really hold.",

I went ravenous so I ordered the chicken and waffles AND the snicker pancake. I mistook the look my friends gave each other when I ordered as \"she's really going to like this\" when really it was \"can't wait to see the look on this broad's face when she sees how HUGE everything is.\" My chicken and waffles were served to me on a serving platter. It was big. It was fluffy. THERE WAS BACON COOKED RIGHT INTO THE WAFFLE BATTER! And it's covered with this big, juicy, crispy-battered, fried chicken. And THAT'S covered with syrup! I'm eating...and I'm like....WTF IS GOING ON IN MY MOUTH? EVERYTHING!  *calming down*  The snicker pancake soon followed and I kid you not when I say this thing was the size of a pizza. One big, fluffy, melted snicker-encrusted piece of pure heaven. Between bites, my friends were shoving mounds of house-made strawberry preserves on toast down my throat. If ever I had to describe the taste of diabetes (diabeetus), this would have been it. My friends, diabeetus...tastes.....GREAT. Go to Hash House-a-Go Go. You won't regret it.",

Even at 11 am when we showed up it was packed with a wait of about 40 minutes.   My son had the snickers pancakes and I had the french toast. Both of us were completely satisfied and stuffed when we left. My french toast was sooo good! The bread was thick and then dipped in a banana cinnamon cream with a camelized banana on top.   The food was so good that we continued to talk about how that meal was one of the highlights of the trip (seriously, there's not much else in Nevada, southern Utah, eastern Colorado, and all of Kansas). We were so stoked on the food that we plan to visit the restaurant in San Diego soon. Next up... to try one of the hash dishes!  The service was outstanding even with the long wait. They made sure our order was served up quickly. Loved it and can't wait to go back.",

We got to the restaurant at 3:30, in between lunch and dinner and we were forced to order from the brunch menu. My sister does not eat eggs and asked if she could have the dinner chicken and biscuits. She was told no and that the closest thing was a Benedict dish. She said can I get it without the eggs. The waitress said that their dishes were works of art and nothing could be removed or substituted. My brother in law wanted a biscuit, since we were outside of dinner, he was denied an order of biscuits, even after we offered to pay for them since it was his birthday. Overall, this experience made his birthday one we will always remember due to the unprofessional behavior of its servers, its inflexibility of its chef and the poor times of its menu window. It's such a shame that Hash House has been brought to this level since by the pictures in the lobby, they were amazing!",

I had the sausage gravy pot pie and it was more than enough for two people.  When our server brought it out, my first words were \"holy shit\" that's huge (please refrain from any cheap jokes)!  Rosemarie ordered some eggs and a mango coconut pancake.  The pancake was so big that it came out on a pizza platter. This place is American gluttony in a nutshell.  I almost felt guilty that there was so much food. Bottom line, even though the portions are huge...the food is good.  We will definitely be coming back and definitely be sharing....",

I'll just stick to the Apple Cinnamon for now, but proportions here are huge, I usually like to share anything else that I get, usually their skillets which are very delicious too.",

Probably the best burger Ive eaten next to the one up in Keene NH (which was made from local beef and pannani pressed). We got the cheddar, smoked bacon and avacado burger. HUGE! split it and couldn't finish it! Very friendly service, fun beer selections. Cool decor. Didn't try the hash but looks like everything is freshly made. Stop by, I bet you'll be happy.",

We arrived around 11:30 (peak lunch time).  There were 5 of us and the wait was approximately 45 mins to get seated.  The place is pretty big and the decor is nothing special.  The hubby and I shared a meal since I knew that this place was famous for ginormous proportions.  We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken stacked with bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks ($16.95).  Now I've been to Roscoe's and I guess it wasn't fair that I was comparing Hash House's chicken to Roscoe's.  The chicken just did not meet my standards...not enough flavor.  The bacon waffles, however, were somethin' else!  They were seriously out of this world!  I'm typically not a waffle fan, but the fact that the bacon was fried within the waffle was simply amazing!  :)  The presentation of the dish was pretty cool too (waffles and chicken stacked on top of each other with a knife sticking right in the middle).  I would definitely go back to try some of their breakfast items next time we're in town.",

The price seems kind of expensive for what it is, but i guess the portions make up for it.  It seems that they just pile up a bunch of good together without thinking if it actually works.",

Once we got seated, I expected things to go a bit more smoothly, but unfortunately, it was not to be.  My friend got her food about 10 minutes before mine came out, so hers got cold because she didn't want to start eating before me.  The portions are large, but the food was pretty bland. I had the pecan blueberry pancake, eggs and sausage combination. I got one tiny container of syrup for my monster sized pancake, and there definitely wasn't any warmth to the service- it was obviously \"get em in and out ASAP\" as the mantra. Oh well....",

Thumbs up for Neil Patrick Harris eating here!  I saw the incredibly large portions of food they serve, so I decided to share something with my sister.  We ordered \"Sage Fried Chicken\" - stacked with our famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks for $16.95. I wasn't a fan of the leeks, but those waffles were pretty good. The large portions were what impressed me.  If you're planning on sharing an order, they'll charge you $2.50 for one person not ordering, so they recommend you just get a side of toast or some fries so that way you're not charged for no reason at all.  The waitress was incredibly nice, she made everyone feel comfortable.  I do enjoy my chicken and waffles, but I think I'll stay in California for my Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles next time.",

Our food came out fast BUT the kids meal came out very last & took awhile so my kids were already over it. The atmosphere was just too busy to enjoy a conversation & our food. I don't know if it was where we were sitting but the music was really loud. As for the food, it was just ok. The potatoes on all of our plates, were way over cooked. The seating is what made me not want to go back. After going to the restroom & seeing seating area where it was more calm & empty tables I felt like they just threw us in the traffic area just because, not because there werent any other tables open.",

I was not mentally there to remember all the details or take pictures of food that day but I've had other trips to this place before and after EDC.  The food portions are for giants or about 3 people.  It's supposed to be hangover food but I remember feeling sicker after I ate and took 2/3 of my plate to-go. The food is marginal but thanks to Man vs Food, this place is popular especially with tourists. It's supposed to be food inspired by the MidWest. I'm from the MidWest and we've had better stuff to eat there. The chicken and the tenderloin were so fried, you can hurt your mouth while eating.  I'd like to write descriptions of each dish but thinking about it make me feel woozy. However, they do have a good watermelon drink with alcohol.",

My husband always orders the sage fried chicken & waffle and my usual is the chorizo hash. They're both so delicious but we're never able to finish the plate even on an empty stomach cause the portions are so big. I've also had their salad (I think it was cobb? don't remember), pancakes, and the corn beef hash and they're all equally yummy.   The service was usually good during all of our past visits but on our last, the front staff never put our name down and we ended up waiting much longer than we needed to. We were all hungry and you're not you when you're hungry so when I found out, I was a little upset and for some reason, the service was a bit slow during our whole stay. But to make up for the mistake with the front staff, who turned out to be the manager, gave us free red velvet pancake so we couldn't stay mad.   Couple friends and I are making our way back to vegas for the 4th july weekend and we'll be visiting again to try some new food on their menu.",

Orange juice: definitely fresh and quite delicious!  Chicken and waffles: soft waffle, delicious chicken. Definite recommend along with a side of chipotle cream sauce.   Farm scramble with sun dried tomato and goat cheese: yum, but sun dried tomato was a bit overpowering. Biscuit is nice and buttery. Mashed potatoes were amazing! Very buttery, just the right consistency of chunky to smooth...get this over the bland crispy potatoes.   Cobb salad: gigantic and yum! chicken was dry and oddly sweet, but they sure didn't skimp on the blue cheese and bacon!  Fruit side: small and plain. Not worth it.   I actually felt that I liked the one at imperial palace more, but overall still delicious and worth a try!",

The food was okay... the sushi was good, the sashimi was just ok and in fact, the yellowtail sashimi was very disappointing. I did not eat much as I did not find it all that appetizing, and I love sushi and sashimi.  The ambiance is plain and boring, which would likely have been overlooked if the food was really good.

Unfortunately we had a rude waiter named Robert P.  Some of our party were first time visitors to the restaurant and had a couple of questions.  Robert's response was \"I need you to hurry up!\"  Also, when asking him to repeat the bread options that came with breakfast he got perturbed and was snide when repeating them again.  Unacceptable in my opinion!  The food and drinks that day however were great as usual and other staff in the restaurant were very kind and accommodating towards us.  We won't let this one waiter ruin our opinion of the restaurant, perhaps he was having a bad day.",

    "text": "Came here for Christmas brunch and the place was PACKED. We basically waited for 1 1/2 hours, just enough time for my stomach to eat itself. For such a popular and busy restaurant, the waiting area should really have more benches to sit at. With that said, the servers were really cool even though they were running around trying to tend to all the tables. They were all dressed in Christmas sweaters and jammies, one guy even topped his mohawk spikes with little Christmas hats. I can't even.  The Sage Fried Chicken with maple syrup is simply amazing. My mouth is watering just thinking about the crispy skin and juicy meat. Just looking at the Pork Tenderloin Sandwich makes you want to laugh, it's so big (twss). My brothers got burgers and those portions were almost overwhelming. It's nice to get a choice of sides (fries, salad, or mac and cheese). My mom's friend ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad Sandwich. The milk bread was very soft.   The total meal was under $100 for 6 people! Not something you'd expect in Vegas. Not only that, we had two boxes of leftovers to take back.",

The environment is hip and comfortable. The servers and staff are all friendly and knowledgable about the food and restaurant's history. Definitely worth a stop.

My guy ordered a 2 pattied burger that had roasted red peppers & mozzarella stuffed between with a side of fries. I on the other hand ordered the biscuits & gravy.  Though we were expecting the portions to be big it still took us by surprise when the food was brought out.  Each item was very tasty; I couldn't help but take a few bites here and there from the burger then go back tot he biscuits & gravy. ( I know I sound like a pig here) Needless to say I got full pretty fast.  I was surprised that the check for the meals accompanied with the cocktails we had was cheaper compared to some of the other meals we had while in Vegas. I would definitely go back once I have the chance.",

I love savory breakfasts and definitely recommend getting that.    The plates are huge so come with empty stomachs. We ordered 3 dishes for 4 people and ended up taking a lot of food to go. I would definitely recommend sharing plates.   I don't know how people gave low ratings on food and customer service. Our waitress was awesome and the food was definitely great.

The place was packed and we waited about 20 minutes for the table that was empty when we got there. (That always makes me crazy!)  Waitress had room for improvment, but the bus boys more than made up for her.  I had corn beef hash, of course and it was good. It defiantly had some twists, like cheese and the corn beef was definaly not chopped up much. My favorite was the busicut, so yummy and fresh.  My sister had the hamburger, it was huge. She said it was good but not as fabulous as everyone says it is.   Her boyfriend had french toast, I had a bite it was good. Crunchy on the outside and warm and soft inside. Very Good.  Overall it is an experience but might have had a 4 or 5 star experience at a less busy time.  Oh and do not forget the bloody mary, it was GREAT and chunky.",

    "text": "Thank you Adam Richman and Guy Fiere for featuring this gem on your show so out of town foodies - like me - know where to go for some fabulous grub! This was one of a few restaurants that I would see featured on food shows and bookmark on Yelp to try whenever I'm in the area.   I wish I heeded fellow yelpers advice about the ginormous portions at Hash House. My bf and I were hungry so we decided to get the sage infused chicken & waffles AND the hot granola with fruit to share. Our jaws dropped at the enormity of the dishes when it came to the table. It was enough to fees 2 more people.  The sage infused chicken and waffles was amazing. The chicken is so crisp, light and tasty. The waffles were a plenty and had strips of bacon baked inside them. My fave part of the dish was the deep fried green onion shavings. Ingenious touch - complimenting taste and excellent texture. My only (minor) issue with the dish is that I prefer my waffles a darker golden brown and crispy but it was still damn good.  The hot granola with fruit was nothing close to what I had expected. I ordered it thinking it would be a nice healthy compliment to the chicken and waffle dish but i was wrong. I can best describe it as sweet, gooey goodness with berries and sliced peaches mixed into it. It was also topped with big sliced of bananas, strawberries, watermelon, etc. It was really good but so bad for you. I felt like eating the whole bowl would give me enough energy to run a full marathon. I LOVED it but it's definitely something that needs to be shared with 2-3 people.   I'm definitely coming back here the next time I'm in the Vegas area. There were other items on the menu that I'd love to try.",

    "text": "this was a mind-numbingly good meal.  It's rare to see a restaurant be innovative with breakfast--rare to see them break out of the eggs-1000-different-ways mentality. But Hash House does so, and succeeds.  They have a wide variety of unique breakfast fare, as well as traditional fare stepped-up a notch in quality.  The portions are absurdly large, which is probably why the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict was featured on Man Vs. Food. The pancakes are superb, as was the Sage Benny which is bacon, fried chicken and eggs atop a biscuit atop mashed potatoes, all smothered in a chipotle cream sauce.  Additionally, the cast of Pawn Stars was seated next to us. But expect a wait for a table, this place is hopping.",

I wanted to preface this review by giving an overall positive comment despite my somewhat low rating.  Today was my first trip. I ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken with bacon mashed potatoes, eggs, and a biscuit. The biscuit was decent, the eggs were pretty standard, the potatoes were ok, and the chicken was absolutely mind-blowing. If you like fried chicken, your only complaint might be that it was a boneless breast, but otherwise it was amazing. There was also a lot of fluff on the plate - a big watermelon wedge, an unripe strawberry, and some thin crunchy straw-like things that really did nothing but get in the way.  Epic portions, lots of dishes I want to try, and apparently since I didn't get the bacon waffles, I missed out. I'm going back, but if this place didn't get so many other positive reviews, I wouldn't go back to give it another try.",

It wasn't cozy and I don't remember the service if it was good or bad, so I'm just going to say it wasn't remarkable (being that I can't remember)  I chose to go here a second time only because my friend LOVES this place and wanted to meet up for breakfast.  I agreed because I'm not one to argue.  I don't remember what she ordered but it looked okay.  I think it was a massive omelet with avocado.  I ordered a pancake :) Yes just a pancake because after my first experience I didn't trust any of the other weird creations on the menu.  To my surprise the massive pancake tasted just fine, but honestly how do you screw up a pancake.  I was pleasantly surprised my second time so I may consider going again IF it's not my choice.     On a side note I took my family to M Resort because I thought they had a coffee shop, and to my disappointment their \"coffee shop\" was Hash house a go go...I left the resort without even eating and going elsewhere!

Don't get me wrong, everything was edible, but I felt the combination of the Sage Fried Chicken w/ Waffles could have been executed better.  I think the Maple flavored bacon inside the Waffle was a great idea. Trying to achieve that Sweet and Salty flavor some people crave, but this could have been accomplished with smaller bits of bacon within the Waffle. Instead you have large pieces of bacon stuck in between each waffle, I ended up avoiding the bacon all together.  The caramel for this dish actually ruined my Fried Chicken. I prefer my Fried Chicken, untouched with any condiments, this is just a personal preference, but it may apply to those who are considering this dish.  The Fried Chicken itself was crispy, tender, but lacked some unique flavors. I didn't taste any spice or herbs that may have been used in this dish.  FYI: Because their portions are fairly large, there is ~$2.50 surcharge for splitting a dish. The server recommended I order french fries on the side, instead of paying for the surcharge.",

    "text": "The menu here is really unique... This is not an IHOP!   The first time I went was for breakfast and I had the corned beef hash. It was pretty really good because it was \"real\" corned beef hash. (You will see what I mean.) There was so much of it that I had to take it home. It was a complete meal though because it also included eggs and fruit. I did not like the lemonade they served. It tasted gross, but oddly, I think it was supposed to taste that way...  My most recent visit was for dinner. I had the sage chicken with the penne pasta. I did not like the pasta, but the chicken was pretty good. My boyfriend got the sage fried chicken and waffles. He thought it was amazing and so did I!   As far as food presentation goes, they do that very well. The food (during breakfast) is served on these large, heavy skillets. Dinner is served on large (and I mean large) plates.  I adore Hash House. They not only make food good, they make it fun. I love this \"twisted\" farm food.",

Food but doesn't live up to the hype. I am pleased to report that this place definitely lives up to expectations.  First, if you're looking at this review I'm guessing it probably won't be news to you that the portions are HUGE. Seriously, HUGE. The plates are more like dinner platters that you'd see in a buffet. Lots of people seem to order the MvF featured item: Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. I did not indulge, but my buddies did. Let me tell you, this thing was impressive. It's a sky high platter filled with mashed potatoes, homemade biscuits, fired chicken, eggs, and chipotle cream sauce. They bury a knife in it for scale.  I opted for the mushroom, artichoke heart, sundried tomato hash for a healthier option and it was really well done. Flavorful and served with perfectly crispy potatoes and one of their flaky homemade biscuits.   If you're into bloody mary's, they make a really great one. Spicy and tangy, exactly how it should be. The double double lattes are also really great.  This place is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area (go here and NOT to the one on the Strip). Next time I'm planning to try one of the burgers, they looked incredible.",

I'm not a big egg lover but I'll order the one with bacon, avocado and onion even for a late lunch.  With griddled mashed potatoes, of course. You can't go wrong with anything they serve - just be prepared to take a box of leftovers home for a second, maybe even a third meal.   The atmosphere is fun and sort of down home Midwestern (where I'm originally from) but with a sleek, urban flair.",

The portions are just insanely huge, and could even be intimidating for some people. It has a biscuit, eggs, cheese, chicken, all topped with their hollandaise sauce. Overall it was pretty good, though the chicken was a bit dry. I failed in finishing my order but according to our server, he's only seen one person finish the whole order in one sitting.  I actually thought the staff was pretty friendly. Our server was fairly quick and wasn't being a douche. He was helpful in answering our questions and whatnot. Overall, I think I would've enjoyed this place even more after a long night of drinking, but I still enjoyed it nonetheless.  p.s.: They serve beer in a paper bag. How cool is that?!?!?",

Went here for Sunday brunch, it was crowded but got in after a short wait, maybe 15 minutes or so.  Got the Hash House Quesadilla stuffed w/potatoes, jalapenos, eggs & tomato w/chili cream with a side of mashed potatoes.  Service was efficient, friendly, warm and simply amazing.  When the food arrived at the table, wow!  Really big portions, got a sprig of rosemary.  Just a wonderful presentation.  The aroma was awesome!  I've been overwhelmed before with presentation (oh, it looks too wonderful to eat!) but never the presentation and the aroma!  I mean, it was so fresh, so vivid, the jalapenos were bright green, the potatoes so wonderfully mixed, the egg just done to perfection, the chili cream just right....mmmmmm....gotta tell ya I had my first foodgasm ever eating this very breakfast brunch at this very Hash House A Go Go.  My wife, who hates melon and citrus, couldn't believe how wonderful the melon slice was that came with our breakfasts.  Ate the whole thing.  The orange slice too!  Got so addicted we went back every other day while on vacation, trying other places then going back to Hash House A Go Go for some real food.  The freshness, the variety, the aroma, the taste, it was fantastic.  Gotta warn you, though, after coming back from vacation we've been dining out from time to time here, and it's just awful.  Even places we liked back home don't compare.  Too salty, no flavor, no aroma, not fresh enough, etc. etc.  We keep yearning for Hash House, I guess our next vacation will be planned near one of their restaurants.  It's like buying clothes all your life at Target and then discovering Armani Express or AG.  Except Armani Express and AG for the same price as Target.  You gotta wonder, WTF.",

I ordered The Tractor Driver Combo with French Toast. It came with two eggs and bacon. The eggs were on the cold side and the bacon was crisp as ordered. The French Toast was good and had a cut banana on top. The banana would of been better without the skin. I also ordered coffee, which I drink black. The coffee was fairly strong. Overall, I thought the food was good, but overpriced. In my opinion, IHOP is good and a much better value for the money. The coffee is also better. The server was nice and attentive. Thank you Brannon for your quick response. I have been involved with the Restaurant Industry since 1972 and have eaten at many restaurants. I am just giving you my honest opinion on my experience.

Ham, fresh spinach, smoked bacon, grilled mozzarella, scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes...all covered in chipotle cream.  Only the unripe hothouse tomato disappointed.

These are some of the sights you will see and experience when dining at Hash House a Go Go.  Wait till you see the food when brought to other patrons... you WILL be intimidated.... I guarantee it! The farm people from Indiana must be related to Paul Bunyan in some respects.... serving sizes are double, no... triple that of other restaurants. I exaggerate NOT!  On the menu today....  Buttermilk Biscuits (*** 1/2) with a shiny Honey-Glaze on the outside are a complimentary precursor to your meal. Do not, I repeat DO NOT consume these Biscuits! The restaurant will try to tempt you with small Stainless Steel cups of Butter and Honey... but don't do it! The second problem is that you can't take 'em home... they'll be hard as a rock the next day. They're about three inches across by another three inches high. They'll just ruin your dinner. I've warned you...  Boston Hash (*** $14.95) Crispy Potatoes in two inch chunks, mixed onions, fresh tomatoes crowned with Hash House a Go Go's famous all blue Crab Cake drizzled with Horseradish Cream and served with probably a four-egg mixture of Scrambled Eggs with stalks of Asparagus and strings of Fried Pasta as Garnish. And all served on a three inch deep by eight inch square Iron Skillet. Opinion - I like the humongous serving sizes... but did anyone from the restaurant perform taste testing? The Crab would have been better served within the Egg Scramble mixture. The Country Potato concoction was barely surviving bland in flavor.... Add some Green or Red Peppers, FGS. Despite the presence of Horseradish... could not provide enough flavor contrast to save the entree.  Chicken & Waffles (****-Kathy's rating... she's pretty easy. $12.95) On Friday Nights - the Chicken and Waffles are ONLY $12.95! This is an unbelievable BARGAIN! Huge, and I mean HUGE pieces of Chicken... white Chicken pieces resting on top of four Bacon-infused Waffle Squares topped with some fancy-schmancy Onion Rings with some fried Green Onions thrown in which gave it an Oriental flavor. I'm not kidding... the Waffles are embedded with BACON! Looked like Mt Everest when brought to the table. Kathy, my daughter, let me try some of the Sage rubbed herb Chicken... super, super tender pieces of meat. My own opinion... dump the Sage herbs when frying the pieces of Chicken. Maybe I'm just used to plain ol' Fried Chicken with just Salt & Pepper when consuming with Waffles.  Lemonade (****)  Iced Tea  Total: $35.99  Service (****) Server was on top of everything, always topped our drinks on time. Very talkative.... despite not knowing very much about the restaurant management. In fact, she admitted, before working at Hash House, she NEVER heard of or tasted Chicken & Waffles or even had Meat Loaf. Now, that's a different kind of virgin that I've heard of!  Dessert - You've got to be kidding! If you finish the Biscuits and whatever you ordered for Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner.... there will be NO room for Dessert!  Virtually everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, had their leftovers bagged in plain brown Grocery Bags to be taken home. Does the presence of leftovers translate into a 5-star rating? No, I don't think so.",

After never visiting before the server seated us and took the time to advise on local favorites and specials. After the food was ordered which consists of burgers and breakfast options, the food arrived. I ordered a stack of pancakes and let me say they were huge! If your hungry and you want something under $10 that will fill you then come here! I did and left full. However, once the food arrived to the table the customer went down hill. Server did not visit table frequently and she failed to offer me more water until I asked for more.   Rating is based on good price, large food portions. Not so much for customer service which was below average.",

I happened to be there on the second Saturday of the month, so they had a DJ spinning and had a Hillbilly Hoedown themed party.  It was awesome! Will definitely recommend this to all my friends traveling to Vegas!",

    "text": "I had been here twice years ago. We were meeting family for brunch they selected this establishment. We found out you cannot make reservations. We were a party of 8. The person on the phone suggested coming by 10:30 before the church crowd arrives.  We did arrive at 10:30 and it was crazy busy. We put our name on the list and waited. They seemed to forget about us and gave our table away after having told us they had one just waiting for that party to finish up. After another 10 minutes  we were seated. It is so noisy inside. You cannot even hear yourself think, never mind have a conversation. Not an ideal situation for seeing family from out of town.  Once seated the staff was very accommodating. The service was great.  The food not so much. I found my dish the Indiana favorite sage chicken with eggs very bland. I did not care for the mashed potatoes, again no flavor. The biscuit was good.  And quite frankly it is just too much darn food.",

I could only finish one waffle and chicken.   They have mimosas. That's always a plus.  Hot sauce isn't automatically a condiment that comes with the meal which is a boo but they had sriracha when I asked. So all good.   Had to ask for extra maple syrup. I'm not a syrup whore but for the amount of food, I had to ask for more syrup.   All the people who work there were super chill and nice.",

    "text": "I was looking for a place to have brunch and I had heard from word of mouth that Hash House A Go Go was known for their HUGE portions so I figured it was worth a try. My friends and I arrived around 12:00pm or so and the place was super busy. There was a 30 minute wait which gave me more than enough time to look over the menu so that I could be ready to order once we sat down.  For drinks we ordered the Watermelon Kiwi Limeade and the Smores Espresso. Both drinks were amazing and I would highly recommend both. However, just know that there are no refills on specialty limeades.  For food we ordered the Trucker Combo with the Snickers Flapjack and the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The snickers flapjack was enormous! It was probably larger than my face, it was larger than the plate it was served on. It came with 2 eggs and sausage. Very filling combo with a nice sweet touch added from the snickers. I had a few bites of the Fried Chicken meal. This combo was an enormous serving of fried chicken, bacon, biscuits and mashed potatoes. The meal as a whole tasted pretty good but I would have to say that on an individual level, I was a bit disappointed in the chicken. The chicken was supposed to be the highlight of the dish but it unfortunately tasted the most bland.   All in all, I wouldn't mind going back to Hash House A Go Go but it probably won't always be at the top of my list of choices simply because the type of food served is something that can be found at other establishments and I am just not over my disappointment in the fried chicken. However, the environment was very casual and fun and the price is right considering the amount of food you get. I would be interested to try some other items on their menu as well as enjoy more of their very delicious drinks.",

French Toast is like an explosion of flavor in your mouth :) All cinnaminy and creamy. Eggs Benedict - All the goodness without the chicken.  Prices are unbeatable.

The staff there was very friendly. It was not yet too busy (9AM Sat) and we were seated right away. We got our order in and the food was out in 10 minutes. We looked over at the lobby at that time and it was packed so we just beat the rush. They must be doing something right to have all these people wanting to eat there. The waitress was excellent  Our orders were handled professionally and all throughout our visit the drinks were filled and our needs were met immediately. The food presentation is exceptional. The plated dishes are very appealing and we were watching dishes go by our table with excitement. I have to admit that the food just doesn't blow me away in the taste dept. though. The flavor is good but it just doesn't match the quantity or presentation. I wound up going twice over the weekend and the second trip we had to wait 25 minutes for a party of 13 to be seated. It was packed in there. We still got great service though and I commend the staff there for being well trained and getting everyone in and out as quickly as possible. Overall I would eat there again but won't go out of my way for it.",

As soon as I walked in, the hostess compliments me on my jersey and the bartender asks me if the Lakers are going to win that night.  Right away they got brownie points for being Laker fans and making me and my family feel welcomed.  Since we got there around 11:30AM, we beat the lunch rush and they sat us down in less than 5 minutes.  The place is nice and open with lots of noice and ambiance going on, perfect for a family with small kids.  My sons ordered the kids pancakes and my daughter order the chocolate chip pancakes.  My wife and I shared the Sage fried chicken and waffles, because I read on yelp how huge the order is.  My kids pancakes where huge.  My 6 year old some how managed to finish his pancake, and he's a skinny boy.  Even the waitress was impressed he was able to finish such a large pancake.  I had a taste of the two different pancakes and they were good, were they the best I've ever had, no, but they aren't bad.  As for the Sage fried chicken and waffles, yelpers were not kidding, this is a huge order,  it's definitely perfect for 2 people to eat.  The Sage fried chicken was extremely tasty and the waffles were like heaven, especially with the bacon made into the waffles.  The combination of the Sage friend chicken, waffles, bacon and syrup was delicatable.  I have been to Roscoes Chicken and Waffles in Los Angeles several times, and I have to admit, this place blows away Roscoes for the fried chicken and waffles dish.  Next time I'm in Vegas or San Diego, I will definitely drop on over the Hash House A Go Go to try some of their other tempting dishes.  Make sure to come with a huge appetite, because all their dishes look pretty big.",

I had the famous Andy's sage fried chicken.   It was a gut busting portion, but for $16 it should be.  The menu said \"sage\" right?  I couldn't taste it.  Very bland from top to bottom.  The chipotle cream had the essence of chipotle.  My friend ordered the banana brown sugar flapjacks and was probably the best thing on the table.

The hostess are the snobbiest girls ever and are ridiculous. They are rude and kind of single people out to sit first and they make up policy as they go. I came with my friend we both come a lot this is just one example (the most recent), so she put in the name and when it was time to sit the girl said no because I wasn't here, said you can't sit until your entire party is present, so this is a party of 1 versus a party of 2, it's the same table.  That rule is so that one person cannot reserve a huge table for like 7 people when other people are waiting it is irrelevant in this situation. My friend complained while I was on my way and they sat her, but why did that have to be so hard? I've had hostess answer the phone and refuse to take carry out but they take phone carry out orders regularly.  I've called to ask what time can I come in on Sunday before they close and they said by 2:30 and get there at 2:15 and they are at the door saying they aren't letting anyone else in, and I say I just called a half hour ago to ask, it doesn't make sense? The hostess make policy as they go. And the music sucks always. This place is 5 capable though. Funny thing is I told the manager again about the problem and she was sorry, didn't do anything but said they are aware that they have bad hostesses and continue to tell them to give better service but that they are hard to find, she actually said this.  I was shocked that there wasn't a solution apparent to her, but okay.  Hence my review.",

The initial sticker shock was quickly eased ( about 15 bucks a plate) with the mountain of food that the waiters brought us. I had the sausage gravy pot pie which had many golf ball size sausage balls in a delicious country gravy, a pile of scrambled eggs, and not one, but 2 giant scoops of roughly mashed potatoes. This was so big that I ate my left overs the next day and STILL have another meal. My only complaint on that was that the pot pie crust was pretty hard and cooked separate so not really a compliment to the meal.  The wife got a stuffed quesadilla that hung over the giant plate. it was covered in a delicious queso sauce with just the right amount of kick. My favorite part was that they put fresh jalapeno chunks in the quesadilla.  My mother in law got the salmon scramble which was more salmon than eggs I think. But really delicious.   We all had left overs which were still awesome the next day. Definitely a must do in Vegas.  The only bad part was that they don't have sweet n low for my iced tea.. but I'll live without it.",

    "text": "We recently took a family road trip from San Jose all the fricken way to Las Vegas and it was one of the best road trips I have ever taken.  The desolate scenery was exactly what I needed to get away from the hustle and bustle of the busy city.  Because we came in right before the New Year, everything was packed, and the hotels no longer sold those Buffet of Buffet passes.  But surprisingly, the Imperial Palace, now known as the Quad, was our jewel on the strip.  Because the dining at Hash House is way up at the top of the Quad, it was not swamped with people.  After escaping the mad crowds and taking several escalators to something like the fifth floor, we got to Hash House.  The service is prompt, they seated us quick, and were oh so kind to talk about the menu to let us know what we were getting into.  Hash House's theme is \"freaky farm food\" and it is so True to its nature.  Everything on the menu is some traditional classic like waffles, fried chicken, steak, pork chops, all twisted into some freakish concoction either through sheer size of portion or some twist in the cooking methodology.  We were looking for a dinner for three, and know that because we're small and Asian, we don't eat that much.  A McDonald's chicken patty can be dinner for 2 of us with rice.  We went for the most highly recommended item based on conversations with buddies - FRIED CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.  Holy !$%^.  The stupid thing is gi-normous.  My good buddy who recommended said not to order more than 1 because it would make us feel guilty.  Once you see the thing, you realize you're in trouble.  3 fried chicken breasts over 3 bacon-stuffed waffles, fried herbs on top, and some kind of mash hash thing under it all.  Maple syrups is provided to glaze over the whole mess.  At the top, there is an 8\" jagged blade stuck down the entire stack to keep it in one piece.  We ordered a house garden salad, entree style, to help offset the protein rich platter.    It took 3 of us to down the entire thing.  The way it was fried was beautiful.  Something in the batter just made it all the better.  The waffles were crisp, wholesome, and the bacon was just a nice added bonus.  If any one single person were to finish this on their own, I would congratulate them for setting themselves up for their first heart attach.  I don't even want to know the calorie count on that bad boy.    One of the things I love about the place is that they sell gift cups for their blended drinks.  The hostess was so kind to recommend it.  We ordered a couple drinks, enjoyed them, and they washed, dried, and boxed our cups to go - a great gift.    Bottom line: if you are vegetarian, don't go here.  For everyone else, this is as good as a Vegas buffet at HALF the price.  Because of its separation from the casino part of the hotel, it was a glad reprieve from the madness and second hand smoke.  Nice and tucked away, on a very late evening, it's a great place to eat in peace.  Lunch and dinner rush time though ... I'm sooo soooo sorry for you all...!  Oh yeah, expect to have ZERO cellular signal in this part of the hotel... I love being disconnected from work calls and emails.  Damn you blackberry, damn you!",

    "text": "I came to Las Vegas with my grandmother, father, and my two children to watch the December 4th Rock and Roll Marathon. We asked someone who lives in Los Vegas about restaurants they would recommend and this was the first place they mentioned. In fact, they were emphatic that we had to go there, if only to experience the HUGE portions they serve.  When we arrived, we were told to expect about a half hour wait, and that's about how long we waited. While waiting, we took in our surroundings: it's a warm and inviting restaurant with exposed beam ceilings, which suggest down-home country building. It's December, so they'd decorated for the season, with a HUGE tree in the middle of the room decorated with lights and large ornaments. Stockings were hung here and there, and what looked to be fake poinsettia plants were arranged on dividers between the sections of the restaurant. Normally, I don't like to see phony flowers in a restaurant, but in the case of seasonal ones that are sure to be removed before dust settles, that's fine with me, especially when it's as well-kept a restaurant as this one is.  We were told to arrive HUNGRY, so we did, and we're glad we did! Our friends were not exaggerating when they said the portions were humungous. My children both ordered from the kids menu, both opting for chocolate chip buttermilk pancakes. I promise to swear on a stack of bibles that their eyes were as huge as saucers when their pancakes were brought out to them! The pancakes from the kids menu are nearly as big around as basketballs! WOW! My 8 year old couldn't finish, and the 9 year old finished but didn't want a thing to eat all day after that!  I ordered the Tractor Driver Combo, which is two eggs, made to order, your choice of bacon, sausage or potatoes, with a buttermilk pancake. My eggs were ordered over medium, which should be a firm white with a creamy yet runny yolk, there should be no uncooked egg white at all with over medium eggs, yet that's what I got, and the yolk was watery instead of creamy in texture. If you order over medium or over hard, be certain to specify to the wait staff that you do not want runny whites. I wasn't overly concerned about it, though, because the flavor wasn't bad and the sausage had a really nice flavor. And, besides that, the pancake was clearly the star of the show! The plate all of this was on was an oval shaped one, longer than a football (american) and as wide as a soccer ball. The pancake itself was also wider than a soccer ball! And it was GOOD!!  We all agreed that this was a restaurant to return to. I would have given it 5 stars, but for our eggs (all three adults ordered over medium and they all came out with runny whites and watery yolks) and the fact that the corned beef hash dish my father ordered came out in a skillet that had not been prewarmed, so in the process of transporting it from the kitchen to the table, his eggs were stone cold. I'm hoping this was an oversight, though, so that next time we go and receive it in a warm skillet, we can post a new review with all 5 stars (HINT HINT To any Hash House a Go Go staff that see this review: Warm Your Skillets Before Plating!! LOL)  Would I recommend this restaurant? You Bet!",

The place is decorated in a sort of industrial aluminium motif which you will either like or not. The food is American Country dishes like Pancakes, Farmers Breakfasts, Chicken-Pot pies etc.   The food portions are simply enormous. I ordered a glas of OJ (about a pint arrived) An apple/ cinnamon Pancake (the size of a single Duvet) and a Corned beef hash Breakfast (a mountain of Hash, 3 Eggs 3 Sausages).   I was getting full after the pancake and I would not have ordered so much if I had known how much food they give you.   My Wife had a Combi bacon / Eggs / Pancakes breakfast and couldn't finish hers either.   The service was prompt and friendly.   After having breakfast here we didn't eat again til about 8 that evening and felt well-fed all day.",

It was bizarre how it had no flavor. The bacon in the waffles is an interesting idea but the doughy, undercooked, flavorless waffles didn't seal the deal.  The portion was HUGE but who cares if the food is garbage? It has been a long time since I felt this disgusting after eating. The rather large couple next to us were boxing their leftovers... LEFTOVERS... and it was still enough to feed someone for three days. Looked so gross.  Also got the filet appetizer that is served on polenta with some sort of pesto on it. Again - FLAVORLESS... Unreal!  Unlike some of other reviews, our service was pretty good. The waiter was friendly, our drinks well looked out for. The place is clean and looks nice on the inside. If I didn't have a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon for it I would've been doubly pissed but as it were, even at half price I will never go there again.

    "text": "Mmmmm food! This is a great breakfast eatery to visit when you are famished or waking up with the drunk munchies from tying one on the night before. The portions are ginormous and the presentation is pretty extraordinary too. I don't generally like for my food items to be all loved up to each other like they serve it up here but at Hash House, it works. Everything on the plate is served as though it is one item, if that makes any sense. All I know is, this is some delicious grub.   Andy's sage fried chicken is so warm, juicy and sage-y. So good. But it's hard to make a decision because the smoked salmon benedict is incredible as well. They offer quesadillas with a sriracha garnish that is a favorite of mine too. I have tried most of the menu items at one time or another and the only thing I would not order again is the pot pie. I didn't like the cracker crust. Just a personal preference. Hash House is not a one trick pony either. The lunch and dinner menus have some great dishes. I haven't sampled as many items as I have on the breakfast menu but I definitely recommend the crispy cornmeal salmon sandwich. The wheat bun and chili mayo really make this sandwich sing. Love it.   Besides the pot pie, I also don't like the split plate charge. IMHO it is inappropriate to charge more money for the exact same amount of food just because more people are going to be eating it. I rolled in with a group of four that selected three entrees to share, which would have been more than enough food to feed five people, only to be told that there was something like a $3.00 split plate charge. I'm not sure of the exact amount. And while three bucks isn't that big of deal it still seems unnecessary.   Those few cons won't keep from going back though. The food is just too good.",

My dish came in a skillet which was cool but my eggs looked funny and my food was actually lukewarm...my meatloaf wasnt flavorful at all and there was WAY too many veggies going on and cheese.  Even though it was healthy hearty ingredients, i couldnt enjoy the meal since it was so bland!  I didnt even bother finishing anything, and the biscuit was alright, kinda dry too.  I'm giving it three stars is because i did try the fried chicken sage and the sauce was really good, teh chiptole sauce, you can DEFINITELY taste the chipolte and it was very smooth and creamy and the chicken was juicy....but thats it!

Two breasts with drummies and about two full waffles with the bacon cooked into the waffle. Making this to order took about 20+ minutes for it to get to the table and it was worth it. Gotta say the chicken was good, the waffle was good but as another review said - a little more syrup (okay, \"Maple Syrup Reduction\") would have made it a bit better.

My coworker was first to arrive, and since this was my late birthday lunch, she asked if they could bring out a cheesecake for dessert. We arrived shortly after, ordered drinks and browsed the menu to decide what to have for lunch. While we were trying to narrow our options, out came the cheesecake with a lit candle. It was quite comical as we all looked at each other confused, like isn't this supposed to come out after the meal? We just kept the cake at the table and ordered our food. The wait time was pretty long considering we came in for lunch. The food finally arrived, and was as we expected enormous, but very delicious. Our server was very nice, but the service was definitely lacking.  All in all, the service was mediocre. At one point two of the servers had a small chit chat right in front of our table (and I mean practically standing over us) while they were holding dirty plates from a table they just cleared. Pretty awkward. The whole meal took about an hour and a half, kind of long if you came on your lunch hour, but the quality/quantity of food makes up for the wait.",

The ultimate comfort food. I'd order that, and a side salad, to go and that one meal would be enough to feed myself and my husband for dinner with leftovers. (And we can put away some food!) Everything I've ever had there is amazing, the prices are reasonable, and the ambiance is chic. Now come up with some vegan options so I can go back!",

It has a big hunk of brick-hard, dry toast hanging on the side.  It was nothing like I remembered.  I then jumped into my Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and it too had changed...for the worse.  It was really bland and just a pile of mashed potatoes with a dry biscuit split on top and a fried chicken breast on top of that.  Piled on top of it all was a pile of bland scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and a spicy cream sauce.  The sauce was nice and the chicken breast was flavored well but that was it.  I wished I had gone with my tried and True favorite: the banana and brown sugar flapjack.",

If you can't guess which one, then you're probably taking those long walks by yourself. Did someone say Yelp A-hole of the Day? But I digress...  It seems like the word \"griddled\" is used freely in every entree here. The griddled mash is definitely worth a try, but don't joke about a griddled glass of orange juice...my waitress didn't find it particularly funny...  One of their local favorite dishes is the Sage Chicken Benedict, which combines two of the greatest things eaten by humans, Chicken and Benedict... Ask for the Gravy on the side, as this baby is a messy one.   If your still hungry and you won't be, I'd try their famous Meatloaf House Hash. It's like the meatloaf my Asian mom never made....hmmmmm.  So if you want a breakfast far from the crowds of the Las Vegas Strip, or if your just walking home at 3am with your shoes in your hands...come down to Hash House a Go Go. It's breakfast without judgment!",

I did have two order mishaps, when I was there and is impacting my rate. I ordered a iced soy latte and was given a hot soy latte instead. They fixed the mistake, which ended up not being a big deal. I did get disappointed when they brought me a waffle, when I ordered a pancake. They fixed this mistake as well, but I had to wait a good amount of time while it was fixed. I recommend not ordering the Tractor Trailer special, which is supposed to be a pancake and egg breakfast with bacon, sausage, or potatoes. It is just not worth the money. The meal is basically one giant pancake with egg and whatever side you choose. They tell you the servings are big when you come, but obviously in this case they are only referring to the \"flapjack\". The pancake was good though. The meal wasn't anything amazing. The potatoes weren't very seasoned and the eggs were okay. I would go again to try something else, but am not in a hurry.",

Seated outside and not exactly ideal when you have a hangover and the sun is not your best friend.  Luckily, there are giant umbrellas that save your eyes.  HUGE portions.  HUGE.  Two people can split a meal and be full, trust me.  I literally touched half of my meal (Andy's Sage Fried Chicken with bacon, eggs, and a biscuit) and was full beyond belief.  This place is spot on with their presentation.  Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade garnished with a slice of watermelon.  Burgers topped off with a stick of tarragon to keep the burger together instead of a toothpick.  Lots of fancy food decor.  The meals here look so appealing and appetizing.  Pancakes are HUGE.  Burgers are HUGE.  Everything is in super large portions so make sure to come hungry and leave full.  You really get your money's worth.  Lots of celebrities grace their presence at Hash House so it's nice to eat here at the original location if you're into that tourist sort of thing.",

Go find some stupid spot on the strip to rip you off to the max.  This place is great.  Always good service, and most of the time..you leave with as much food as u stuffed in your face at the table.  This time for me...I came very hungry.  Ordered the chicken and waffles, since I had it before and loved it. The waffles have bacon in them..bacon.  The syrup is sweet enough to offset the saltiness of the chicken.  Perfect pair.  The sage they put on the chicken, gives it such a unique flavor that I just love! When your plate comes...its beautiful.  Very well put together and decorated.  All you can do is stare, take it in, then devise a plan of attack...as I did this day.  I was determined to leave with nothing in my had but my car keys.  The steak knife holding the dish together is needed.  I cut that thing up methodically and devoured it.  Even got a compliment from one of the waitresses who was impressed with how I took down the plate.  I didn't know if I should be completely proud of myself...or run to the gym since I now feel like the fattest person in our universe. All-in all...I didn't have doggy bag.  Mission accomplished.  All the food here is great.  Can't go wrong with anything.  If you want to be prissy and complain about portion size? Go somewhere else.

This place is not close to the strip, so it doesn't hit a lot of people radars when they search Yelp for a great place to eat.  But if you're willing to take a little drive or cab ride off the strip and want a super meal, breakfast-lunch or dinner, this Hash House A Go Go is a fantastic place to go!!  Location~ just a couple of miles off the strip in the Asian Market area.  The restaurant is very clean and inviting and easy to find.  It has a great ambiance that is family friendly.   Food~ it's hard to choose from one of their many hash skillets if you're dining for breakfast or just feel like eating breakfast for dinner.  Their veggie and corn beef hash skillets are two of my faves.  Both are DELISH, served with eggs of your choice, on top of potatoes and with a biscuit (or what ever you would like to eat)!  They also have super burgers and pretty extensive menu with loads of things to choose from.  Yes, their portions are huge, so you may want to share with a friend if you're not hungry :-)  Service~ it's always top notch.  They are very accommodating even for the pickiest of eaters.   They are very friendly and eager to help you.    This is one of the best places to dine in Vegas off the strip.  They offer flavorful food and super service.  I hope to see you there some day soon.",

I'm usually not a big fan of Corned Beef but Man, this was a game changer. It came in a black skillet with biscuits and jam, potatoes and scrambled eggs.

Night after night of going out and what not really drains you and when you wake up, your famished!!! so here i was, FAMISHED. and i think we waited for an hour? hour and a half? but for a party of 8 :\\ so that could have also been a factor... anyways, if your hungry come early is what i learned.  on to the food. there are soooooo many choices to choose from! i love breakfast food and everything sounded so delish! i figured i should split because i heard the portions here were SKDJFSLDKJDLFJ OUTTA THIS WORLD... and they were... but hey - that means i have food to eat when i get drunkchies. I ordered the  Andy's Sage Fried Chicken which came with mash potatoes eggs? a giant biscuit oh it has BACON lol every fat kid's dream. i dont know how to describe this to you but it was just simply amazing. it was even more amazing eating it at 4 am. Each time a plate of food came out my eyes were LITEREALLY like O.O DAYUUMMMMMMM. seriously, the portions here are huge. HUGE. even people who were splitting had a hard time finishing... but yeah place is definitely worth it. it is pricey but for the portion you get, its  pretty cheap.",

I'm not sure if it is the huge portions of food that people take pictures of, or the trendy industrial art-deco motif that makes some yelpers think this place is worth it, but I wasn't impressed at all. In fact, I was really disappointed,  First of all, if I am paying $15 a pop for breakfast, you better wow me.  Second,  the food better be pretty freakin' great. It wasn't - not for $15. (Don't confuse large portions with good cuisine, folks.)  Third, when the service is one bad dropped ball after another, I think i stopped counting at six - no refills, no response to requests, no checking back on if you need anything, no seeing how the food is, no pulling of plates, get the picture yet...?  If you read my other Yelps, I sometimes think I may over-rate some restaurants. This experienced convinced me otherwise. Sorry - NEVER AGAIN!",

    "text": "Vegas gets a lot of international visitors, many of whom are in the U.S. for the first time.  So as a public service, let me explain a vital aspect of American culture: we like things to be big (note the casino-resorts on the Strip, the Grand Canyon and monster trucks).  This goes for food as well--we want it tasty and in massive portions (if it tastes great on the first bite, it'll be excellent on the 2,456th bite).  So, foreign tourists, if you haven't fed at the American food trough, you should, but make sure it's a tasty place.    Enter Hash House A Go Go (\"HHAGG\").  The pancakes come bigger than your head (and in a stack of three).  Prefer eggs?  The omelettes coming out of the kitchen are the size of a chicken.  And, unlike the generic buffets being offered at the casino-resorts, the food at HHAGG has flair.  The plating is creative and the food is simple, but imaginative--picture the classic steak and eggs just back from a European vacation and testing out French fashion on American soil.     So why only four stars?  Well, for all the food's glitz and gigantic size, the taste is relatively straightforward.  HHAGG advertises that it serves \"farm food\" and while they do a good job with the classic tastes, there just isn't anything unique or amazing.    That said, after a rough night on the town, there are few dishes that satisfy as well as the O'Hare of the Dog (24 oz beer in a paper bag and 7 strips of bacon).  Final take: the food is solid and the place offers a great experience.  One of the better breakfast places in Vegas.",

I wanted to eat healthy, so it couldn't be just a fried breakfast joint!  This Hash a go go was perfect.  I could not have found more ideal restaurant.  I ordered the granola cereal, and fruit which turned out to be a very large bowl of fresh granola with great tasting fruit water melon, black berries, blue berries, banana, raspberries, and pineapple all were fresh and quite tasty! I also got my partner the special granola and peach pancake which I tasted and we agreed was fantastic and way too much! The service was excellent and met all my needs without asking! I really like the idea of not only following status quo for the usual routine breakfast food, I like the clever progressive options also on their menu!   Look forward to my next visit!",

This time, there was a 30 minute wait, and it took a while for our orders to come again (but since  I expected that on a Saturday, I wasn't so upset this time). Besides, just order a delicious Blood Mary and you'll be perfectly satiated until the food comes.    We ordered a couple dishes to share, and our friend was skeptical that it would be enough food.  I wish I took a picture of his expression when the Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict was set on the table. I had been raving about this dish, and once again, it did not disappoint.  Three of us polished off this plate easily.  You just can't go wrong with this item.   We also shared the Brown Sugar Banana Flap Jacks which bigger than the actual plate is was served on.  And upon first bite- I was in heaven.  It is sooo delicious.  The crispy brown sugar pieces combined with the ripe banana is a flavor explosion.",

Don't like how we asked for some dipping sauce and they said we would have to pay extra for sauce..... -_- I think we ordered one of the Hash House specials. It had chicken, potatoes, eggs, and biscuits. The food was pretty good.  But that was only in the first 10-15minutes of eating. The mac'n cheese wasn't very good.  I think easy mac would've been better.  The service wasn't bad.. Our waitress was friendly.  Overall, a fun experience and an eye opener.

I like their famous Benedict and the chicken and waffles with the maple sage reduction was also really good. The french toast is really great too - but I'm a sucker for fried bananas - so I feel those make that dish.   The staff is nice - the food came out quickly - the wait wasn't too crazy (and I'm usually there on weekends) - and the prices are more than fair.  This may seem weird but the stainless steel tables are freezing - like 'uncomfortable to put your hands' on freezing. And the decor is okay but I don't know if it's that \"trendy\". The decor reminds me of a barnyard version of Chipotle. But who cares - its about THE FOOD - and the food is really good.   I always have to go to Hash House if I visit Vegas.",

    "text": "\"Beast Warrior Proportions\".  That's the best way to describe the amount of food that you get at Hash House.  A comparable visual would be that scene in the \"Flintstones\" intro where Fred orders the bronto ribs, gets said food, and the car tips over.  That's the experience here.  For that reason, I'm convinced they have steel reinforced tables.  Yesterday was the five year anniversary of this branch.  5 cent beers and free appetizers for their happy hour.  Not thinking, I failed to carry cash with me, and upon realizing this, there was no way I could have purchased a dollar's worth of beer via credit card.  My liver would have exploded.  So in going back to my car, I managed to scrounge about 30 cents out, which either makes me resourceful or a desperate drinker.  Between the five cent beers and tasty appetizers (their fried green tomatoes are wonderful), I was \"good\" for the my visit.  Normal, non-anniversary dining has always been excellent.  The food is good, the portions are stupidly huge, and the atmosphere is fun.  This is more than a \"you get what you pay for\" sort of place.  Their burgers are the size of small throw pillows, and their breakfast fare is tasty (and again, stupidly huge).  Get here early, as the place fills up fast, and they're only open for a few hours at a pop.  Who knows what will happen in \"Year 10\", but I imaging I'll have five years of various dining experiences throughout to figure out what they'll do by then.",

The bread was a milk bread (huge thick slices toasted) with the meatloaf, cooked cheddar cheese, & tomato sauce.  The side of mac & cheese was delicious, but I suggest unless your hungry don't order it.  The sandwich was enough for 3 servings.   We sat at the bar since it was full around1:30p.m..  We noticed how they make an ice coffee while sitting at the bar, and let me say it looked yummy.    The menu is moderate, but I can say this, I will be back for something else from that menu.

It is a split biscuit on top on mashed potatoes. The biscuit is topped with spinach, tomatoes, scrambled eggs, fried chicken breast and topped with a chipotle dressing.   This dish is massive and it looks like everything but the kitchen sink was thrown into this dish, but for all the ingredients that are combine here, it works. The flavors compliment each other very well. It was recommended by Adam Richman, who host Man vs Food on the Travel Channel. A very good recommendation.   My wife asked if I would have the dish again and the answer is \"hell yes!\" I would like to try some of the other dishes on the menu. There is a wide range to choose from.

My honey loved the chicken and waffles and literally feasted on it for an entire week. I had the pork sandwich which I didn't care for but I did love the rib appetizer and biscuits.   We didn't care much for the garnishings which looked like they fell from a pine tree but it was nice to see someone try something truly creative in this town. Just have an open mind and palate.",

Bland waffles, tough tasteless chicken and a strange maple reduction that tastes like a soy sauce mixed with Bar-B-que sauce, at almost 20 dollars a plate I expected better(how could the NY times make this their top pick/ ever had roscoes Ny times?). Their drinks are the only saving grace of this restaurant. I had a very good mocha drink and my friend had the watermelon lemonade, both I would order again. Then there is the wait, we had a big group of 7 people and it took them an hour and a half to seat us. Overall I would avoid this place.",

The cab ride was a bit pricey because the restaurant was far from the airport but a friend wanted to try this place so we gave it a Go Go... Hehe ok that wasn't funny.  It probably sounded more funny when I was typing it out.  We came to Hash House at about 11:00AM on a Saturday and had to wait for about 30 minutes.  The place was busy and did not take reservations on weekends.  I'm not sure if they take it on weekdays.  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  The portions were huge and the chicken was decent.  The dish included four waffles, each with a strip of bacon inside the waffle.  When my dish came out, I looked at it and said, \"Hell no I'm eating this thing...\" but to my surprise, it was actually pretty good.  I never thought  fried chicken, bacon, waffles, and syrup would taste good together.  Service is average so expect to wait a little.  All in all, a good place to have breakfast.  One portion is more than enough for two people.  The price is really good at about 13 bucks for the chicken and waffle, which could feed a family of four without a big appetite.  I finished all of my chicken but only ate one of the waffles.  I did pick out all of the bacon from the other three pieces of waffle though.",

Have been here a few times and  have come for breakfast and dinner. No long lines, comfortable seating. OKAY service. The people in the front aren't that friendly and neither are the servers.   I generally just come here for their amazing food. I've had what Adam ordered on Man vs. Food and it's excellent. Except for this one time when I ordered it for dinner and the mashed potatoes were hard and tasted like paste. So lesson learned don't order breakfast for dinner.   So, atmosphere, service is ok but come here for the food. It's good!",

I order what was the man vs food favorite, the andy's chicken egg benedict. ( i think ) When my order came out, It was a really big plate of egg and chicken with biscuit topped with gravy. I devoured it in a matter of minutes. I thought it was pretty good but not all that great. All my friends love my dish especialy the egg because supposedly they could taste the butter in it. I couldnt taste the butter in the egg and didnt know what they were talking about but maybe that was just me being drunk. The other dishes I tried was the waffle and fried chicken from my friend's plate. I thought the chicken with the syrup was too sweet for me but I like the crunch on the chicken. I also remember eating the grilled potato bits or wedges and it was really crispy and good. The tangerine mimosa that got me even more drunk was a little too tangy for me. I like my mimosa more on the sweet side. Thats all I remember.  Overall it was a good experience and being drunk just made the food taste even better :)",

    "text": "Maybe my expectations were too high but Hash House A Go Go kind of disappointed me on every level.   After months of lusting over the Chicken Benedict after seeing it on Food Network I could hardly wait, Too bad I had to. We got there around 11am on a Thursday and the place was pretty packed inside. The hostess was friendly and quoted the wait around 30 minutes unless we wanted to sit outside. Being hung-over and starved we chose the patio and thats where the experience became unpleasant.   Our waitress was cool but it took her 10-15 minutes to bring us our drinks and being that we hit the sheets around 5 that morning we needed that coffee and water badly. I ended up ordering the Boston Hash because at the time it sounded amazing, and my bro got the Fried Chicken Benedict so I was just gonna steal bites from him. Our friend just got some scrambled eggs and we ordered one of those giant pancakes to split.  After we ordered we got to talking about the night before and kind of lost track of time before I realized our food was taking wayyy too long. I was able to estimate exactly how long from a text my bro sent as we were ordering and it was going on 36 minutes and we still hadn't seen a plate. After I caught up to the waitress she assured me the food was coming and after another 5 minutes it did.  The plates looked delicious! Everything was piled high, too bad the quality didn't match the quantity! My crab cakes just weren't good at all, they had a good amount of crab but just weren't that tasty, and the horseradish cream that came with it didn't help. Plus my potatoes were soggy and burnt tasting! I tasted my bros Benedict and while it was better than my breakfast it wasn't stellar, the pancake was kinda dry and seemed like it was cooked way before it was brought out. The best thing about the meal was the watermelon kiwi lemonade I ordered and to add insult to injury it took us another 20 minutes to catch a cab out of there. I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.",

She was attentive, down to earth, and gave us great suggestions.   Food: HUGE portions. I ordered the HH meatloaf House Hash. I was a great mix of meatloaf, potatoes, eggs, spinach, cheese, etc. I really enjoyed this dish. The meatloaf was well prepared and seasoned perfectly. The biscuits were creamy and fluffy. I couldn't finish the damn thing, so i spent the rest of the day and parts of the next morning eating it. The GF got the sage chicken, which was awesome as well. Juicy and moist. We also tried to share a blue berry walnut pancake, but failed miserably. We finished about 1/3 and gave up. It was very good though.   Overall, it was a great dining experience. The prices were very reasonable, the service was great, and the food was good. I'll be back, but probably only once every 3 months.

Will probably go here every time I'm in Vegas now and I'm really excited to go back and try the chicken and waffles.",

But for some reason, being a huge brunch and breakfast fan I was never WOWed there.   And honestly Not sure why though.  The food is ok, but something is missing.  Maybe the big portions and the cool environment take away the focus from the fact the food is only ok.   I would recommend to stop by for brunch mostly because it is a fun experience! But not much for the food.   Trust me, I know food!",

    "text": "Easily one of my favorite places. The food is delicious! They use quality ingredients, everything is fresh, it's cooked well etc. Just extremely well executed. I've had almost all of the specialty pancakes and they're awesome. I've also had eggs, bacon, sausage, fried potatoes, chicken pot pie... it's all consistently great. This surely is a quality place. I want to specifically point out the biscuits and gravy for being delicious!  Aside from the taste, Hash House is also a very solid value. Considering the quality of the food, $8-14 isn't a bad price at all. But for that price, you get A TON of food. I eat like a pig, and I never finish anything there. Unless you're a 300 pound offensive lineman, you're going to either share, or take half of it home. With that said, the price is effectively cut in half, making it a deal you just have to take advantage of.",

    "text": "I live in Southern California and have been meaning to try the Hash House in San Diego, but I never had the opportunity.  When I arrived in Vegas, I realized that there are a handful of these around, so I had to try it.  I of course got the chicken and waffles.  When my food came out, I was wowed by the presentation.  Looks totally amazing and over the top.  First bites of fried chicken and fried leeks were very tasty.  The first quadrant of the waffle was also pretty good.  But then, it just got overwhelming.  The chicken is unevenly cut, so certain parts of the chicken were overcooked, the center was good, but obviously not as crispy.  The waffles were on the soggier side - I like my waffles crunchy.  The batter was a little too chewy for my taste as well.  And the syrup was just decent.  A nice pat of butter would have helped.  Personally, my favorite part of the dish was the fried leeks.  Coming from Southern California, of course I have had some great chicken and waffles - Roscoe's, hello!  Roscoe's blows Hash House out of the water in terms of the chicken and waffles as separate entities and as an entire well constructed dish as a whole.  I only ate one piece of fried chicken and two squares of the waffle, not because I was full, but because it was just so overwhelming.  The chicken and waffle both sogged up a little too fast and I decided that it would taste pretty similarly if re-heated in the microwave the next day (I was right).  I actually went home and ate a second dinner because this meal left much to be desired.  +1 star for novelty, +1 for huge portions, +1 for the fried leeks.",

Grabbed a late lunch (can it really be lunch at 4:30pm?) and saw HH right by my clients on Sahara... I have dreams of the waffles and chicken, so I ordered up with one exception: swap a pancake for the waffles! The result: instant classic! The pancake was the size of a manhole cover and the chicken perfectly fried... Is this heaven?  Staff was fun/friendly and the location is open until 9:00pm, so I could have grabbed lunch even later if I wanted.  Here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes Return? Yes (uh, I'm free tomorrow!) Advocate?

    "text": "This was my third time visiting Hash House and the 3rd location I've seen. This particular location was off the strip and the outside looks similar to the one I went to near San Diego. Since there is one directly on the strip in a casino, this location appears to be frequented by more locals instead and less obnoxiously crowded. No need to wait over an hour or so for a table which means we were in and out of there before trekking back to Phoenix in 40 minutes total!  The service was awesome and quick! We especially loved our waitress Izzy! The waiters and waitresses were on top of \"question and answer\" sessions with newcomers. Although there was only my hubs and I at our table, there was a group of 8 next to us with one cranky customer. Despite the customer being unreasonable, their waiter handled the situation with such finesse and ease that it really wasn't such a problem anymore. Whew! Mini crisis averted!  Our food was predictably good. I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken with bacon stuffed waffles while Bry ordered the corned beef hash skillet. From the pictures I uploaded, one could tell that these dishes were mighty and grand in stature and had the flavor to match! Anyone who's \"hangry\" can appreciate how this food can quickly cure and almost overwhelm what you thought would be an insatiable hunger. Bravo Hash for you consistency is pleasing your customers on multiple levels! And bravo on the awesome Bloody Mary variations and even classic Bloody Mary!",

The decor was great, plates looked interesting as we were shown our table, and portion size said that we wouldn't be leaving hungry. Until we tried the food.  My wife had the French Toast with ham & eggs over-medium.  They came out over-easy and bleeding onto her toast, making them all soggy.  I had the Sage Chicken Benedict.  Great presentation and oversized portion...to make up for the lack of taste. It's served on a biscuit with gravy on top of mashed potatoes. The biscuit was undercooked (or just extra mushy) to a point that I didn't know where the biscuit ended and the mash potatoes began. I think the chicken started out with a nice crisp finish that was ruined with too much gravy. The tomato slices in the middle next to the sage should have been a nice touch, but were utterly flavorless.  Our server ask once if we'd like more coffee.  I said \"maybe in a few minutes\".  I didn't see her again for at least 15 minutes when she brought our check.",

The plate was taken immediately. Before I could blink, the manager was at my table apologizing. They'd take it off the bill and get us anything we'd like. We opted for the French toast, which turned out amazing. The other three meals were excellent. Huge portions, well-cooked chicken, great presentation and great flavors. These folks handled the undercooked chicken so professionally, it made us forget about the entire situation so we were able to enjoy our food. We'll be back for sure!",

Last week stopped by for breakfast, had the Chorizo hash, was a little surprised that the food came out before the drinks, and I had to ask for some butter for the biscuit that came with the meal, but the food was very good, hot, and very good flavor  In general, good food, and good service, I'ld say it has been 2 out of 10 times a fault in the service - worst case they forgot to have a runner bring out the food, it sat and was cold when it came out (they cooked new food, had it out quick and took some of the items off the bill)  For the food side, one friend who got the burger with bacon and mashed potatoes on the burger was a very strange combo.  I had a Thanksgiving turkey meatloaf that missed the mark for me (way too sweet).    Over all, it has been a good experience, and it's a place that I try to get to when I get to Vegas.  Just be careful on the weekends, it can get rather busy",

Its the type of place you see on The Food Network or Travel Channel with massive portions of delicious, pornographically conceived dishes bursting from the confines of their plates or hot iron skillets.  I don't really need to say more, but I will.  I chose this place randomly and completely forgot I had seen it on Man v. Food, but saw the fried chicken Benedict advertised as such on the menus, which jogged my memory. We ordered that plus the chorizo hash and both were gigantic and delicious.  The fried chicken was juicy, the gravy was tasty, and the veggies were fresh.   I actually liked that chorizo even more, though, as the spicy sausage was perfectly prepared and cooked with the right amount of heat. That mixed with over easy eggs and the jalapenos, cheese, and potatoes ... just ridiculous!   Their banana latte was also VERY good.   Damn, I want to go back right now! Please open a shop in LA!!! Anywhere on Ventura Blvd would be perfect!!! NOW!!!",

Turns out he had missed one of the women sitting next to me's dishes completely and didn't remember to enter mine for 10-minutes after I placed it. There was a huge wait too which I suspect his being in the weeds was accountable for some of.  I am not sure if it was his server skills or the fact that he was also making all the drinks that resulted in the service being a bit weak, but luckily the food was good as usual.  Hey Hash House management, don't let your bar get too far in the weeds!",

Not only was the service terrible, but the food was not up to par either.    The waitress messed up our order by putting in the wrong plate, this after she told my daughter what she ordered was one of her favorites!  Took us about 30 minutes to get the appetizer.  When I saw food going to another party that came in after us(about 15 minutes later), with more people, I asked our waitress why they were getting food before us.  She argued with me that there was no food on or going to that table.  Three times I told her I saw it with my own eyes.  Finally she came back and said it was because we ordered an appetizer.  It was another 10 minutes before our food started coming out.  Once the error was recognized on my daughters plate, it was another 8 or so minutes before hers came out.    We got there at 7:30 but did not walk out the door until 8:50 pm.  We have had problems in the past with the service and still we returned, but this one takes the cake.  Worst part is that they weren't very busy so you can not use that as an excuse.   After 7 years of loyalty I will take my business else where!",

Not horrible, but definitely not good.  The best description I could give would be the 'taco town' commercial from Saturday night live. It seems like they would be happy to quadruple size your order and wrap it in a Parisian crepe if they had the option.  The chicken pot pie looks pretty appetizing in picture, but when it comes out it has a Sombrero shaped crust that taste like it was made a week ago. Kind of feels like a bunch of leftovers dumped in a bowl with garnish on top. Definitely way overhyped and would never come back.",

We were lucky enough to grab seats at the bar, where our amazing bartenders Cherie and Teresa took the best possible care of us. We dine out often at all ranges of restaurants, and I definitely want the management at the Sahara HHAGG to know what valuable employees Cherie & Teresa are! Cherie in particular made such terrific suggestions for our brunch that we wouldn't otherwise have thought of.

Two servers and three bus boys walked past me approximately seven times. After not being helped or spoken to for 13 minutes, I left. Before this isolated incident I was told by others that this location did not have good customer service. After this experience I am persuaded to agree. Do not patronize this location unless you are okay with being ignored.",

I got the avocado toast, my sis got the fried chicken Benedict (also amazing) and my mom got the Belgian waffle. she loved it! And my mom can be a bit extra when it comes to her liking of waffles and what not, but no complaints here at all. Lol Craig our waiter, was very attentive and super sweet! This was our first time here and we had a great experience. (: we'll be back next time we're in town. (We're from LA) also, don't order too much. Their portions are suitable for 2-3 people. if you order just for yourself, expect a food coma to follow! Lol",

    "text": "What a disappointment. I used to come here every time I visited Las Vegas and really enjoyed the food. I'm a Las Vegas local now and came back for the first time in over a year and it was not as good as it once was.  I had the biscuits and gravy and my girlfriend got the basic breakfast. The portions were large and the presentation was fine but both meals were just barely warm. The gravy was sticky and bland and the biscuit was dried out and hard. The mashed potatoes were lukewarm but tasted ok.   My girlfriends eggs were ordered scrambled soft but came out dry.  The breakfast potatoes were cold and gross like they had been sitting for awhile.  The potatoes were cold enough that the grease was solidifying.  Our server was personable but mostly absent. My coffee cup was empty for awhile before he came back to the table so I could get a refill.  I gave 3 stars because this is the first negative experience I've had here.  If this had been my first visit I would have complained to the staff and not returned.  I like the food choices and the feel of the place but it seems like they are counting on their reputation to bring in customers instead of the quality food and service it was built on.",

    "text": "Hash House has been aired on the food network.  So its quite popular and gets super crowded.  There is usually long lines and they don't normally take reservations.   There are a few locations in Vegas and its smart to call before you go.  If you get lucky, you might be able to get a reservation.   We somehow got a reservation for 4 ppl and were thankful we arrived with no wait.     Everything they served here was in large portions to share with 3 ppl.  Even for 2 ppl, you will be stuffed.  I highly recommend sharing your entrees.   The most popular entree is the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles $18.99.  I ordered it but I was so disappointed.   The entree came in a beautiful presentation.  But the chicken was dry and at least cripsy.  The waffles were soggy.   It was actually pretty gross and i wished i ordered something else.   We also ordered a banana french toast.  It was better than the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles.  But it was too sweet for my taste buds.    Overall, it was curiosity that led me here.  But I wouldn't come back anymore after this expereince.  There are many other places to check out in vegas.",

Huge huge plate with lots of food!!!!! Anyway, I got there around 4pm which was pretty empty but I was expecting a huge crowd since it is a famous place. Well maybe I was too early but I was there so mind just sit down and enjoy the food. There are daily special that costs $10 for a huge plate of chicken pot pie. I saw a couple of people got it so I also decide to get that. It turn out many of them are local and eat then take some home. I was upset that I didn't get the chicken waffle but maybe I can go back to Vegas and eat that some other time. The food was good but it was just too much that I was so full and felt like throwing up if I eat anymore. Obviously, I didn't eat half of it. The server was nice and polite. It is worth for a large group of people.",

I was recommended the chicken pot pie (deconstructed), and it just so happened to be on the daily blue plate special starting at 5pm. It was served in a bowled out, overly large \"cracker\" crust. When mine was brought out I touched the crust and it was cool to the touch, cooler than room temperature like freshly removed from a fridge cool. They took it back and brought me a warmed one.   Cons: everything tasted bland and needed a bit of salt, the crust was like hard tack and the butter I requested didn't help, everything was barely warm and made me feel like I was eating leftovers reheated in a microwave, the hashbrowns didn't feel or taste freshly made,  most noticable...it was DRY. If I didn't have a drink of water with each bite I could have choked.  Pros: my son and husband liked what they got, stuffed meatloaf and the BLT. The waiter was very nice and welcoming. If you want quiet, go at 5pm...there was no one there.",

I usually get the Chicken Fried Benedict, their chipotle sauce on top is amazing. I usually ask for a side of it as well. The portions are huge, and most entree could be share between 2 hungry people.  The downside of this place is the service 2/10 times I come here I will get very slow service. Takes forever to try to get a waiter to take your order, and even longer for the food to come out.   Once, we sat at the patio (Entire patio only fits 2 large parties), and no waiter ever bothered going outside to check on us. We sent tributes inside the restaurants to get the waiter's attention. Sometime they come back with the waiter.... sometimes they come back with food... sometimes they don't come back.... wonder what ever happened to Tom.",

Just please don't be the person that destroys a plate that will feed a small family (i.e. Chicken and Waffles). I witnessed this and it was gross.   I'd recommend the Sage Fried Chicken - it comes with a biscuit, some eggs, and a bunch of bacon mashed potatoes, which were rather unremarkable actually. But remember...doggy bags, people!",

Of course had to order it - very tasty!Nice peppery gravy atop a split biscuit that was decent atop grilled mashed potatoes which I didn't even try because there was way too much food. Could barely make a dent - I would suggest you go in groups of twos and split one dish!  My friend had the bacon waffles which she said were okay. Not enough bacon - just two slices over four waffles - she said she had better elsewhere. I didn't even try them. I was too busy digging out the few pieces of sausage in the gravy! I don't even think I got through a third of it.  Why so many stars? Because of how nice our waitress was - everyone working had really good senses of humour - and the sheer fun of watching the huge portions that went by!",

We took her advice and everyone ordered something different so we could try a lot of the menu! Everything about the experience was just great, the parking, service, ambiance, food, prices, just everything. The only negative I have, and it makes me kind of sad is the waste. My mom asked the our server if there was a lot of waste. She said oh yeah! A lot of waste. I hate to hear that because on my drive there alone I saw 3 homeless people. I just thought how much they would appreciate a meal and here is all this food being wasted.",

My wife and her sister each had the \"Kokomo\" , griddled HH famous meatloaf made with a blend of fresh ground beef, sausage & bacon all trimmed with roasted tomato & griddled smoked mozzarella cheese on milk bread, which they found to be a tad on the dry side.   I had The Tractor Driver Combo which included two eggs w/ bacon sausage or potatoes with 1 HH signature flapjack. This was my second time ordering this meal. The first time I ate the entire pancake, it was breakfast time. This time, I took a good half of the pancake home. Dinner time shows I was not able to complete my meal.  The kids, ages 8 and 6 each had a hamburger. They could have split one burger between them it was so large.   Our server was top notch. The was my sister-in-law's first time here, so I asked what she thought. Her reply was \"it's over rated\".   Ah well... I need a nap.",

Once for breakfast with BF... but I never eat breakfast.  I ordered the smores coffee... sugar, caffeine and huge... I didn't even finish it and was wired out of my mind! Ironically, the who schtick, at HH is the portion size and BF ordered something like bacon and eggs... looked like a IHOP plate.  Second visit was ladies dinner group.  It was fun seeing the ridiculously sized portions arrive at the table and of course the selfies and mugging for the camera  with mountains of food.  I had fried green tomato sandwich with got cheese,  Blech.  Sounded good but execution failed.  I don't know about everyone else, but I thing fried green tomatoes should be soft inside and crunchy outside... these were just crunchy and under cooked and although I took most of it home,   That being said, HH is really about the experience of the ridiculously huge portions (gotta feel sorry for the servers!) and it is usually fun.",

I wouldn't bother with other bfast foods you can get elsewhere. The bf wanted to go the healthier route and got waffles with eggs and sausage. It was ok. Get a dish with chicken.   One last thing. The reason I deduct 1 star was that the server yesterday was so slow/inattentive and he only had our table and a small one to attend to. It took forever to get our check and pay.  Didn't fill our waters either. We noticed another server who was much more attentive. So don't let that server stop you from going. I think it is worth trying.",

    "text": "So my husband and I remembered seeing this joint on Man v. Food ages ago.  We decided to come here not only because of that fact, but there were also multiple locations around the city and the reviews convinced us that we should try it out.    There was no wait for us, but we went around noon on St. Patrick's Day, so it wasn't really that busy.  It took a while to slog through the menu - there were an awful lot of choices and I didn't know what to select.  From watching MvF (or, really, anything Adam Richman does), we knew that the portions were going to be insane - and the server even warned us ahead of time that it would happen.  So, yeah.  Come here hungry if you don't want a takeout box, because nearly everyone had them.  I really wanted the chicken and waffles dish that I'd seen, but I KNEW that was going to be too much.  And in light of what I actually ordered, I'm grateful for that decision.  My husband and I ordered the Tractor Driver special - carby item plus eggs plus potatoes.  I ordered a vanilla waffle, he ordered a Snickers pancake.  (Both items incur a slight upcharge.)  And coffee.  Lots of coffee.  When it came.... the look of shock on both of our faces.  We'd been warned, all right, but neither of us actually knew what we were bargaining for.  The attached pictures show the look on my husband's face as he hefts up the SIDE of this gargantuan pancake.  I mean, really.  It was hanging off the edge of the plate.    My vanilla waffle was not much smaller, either.  It came with a small container of sweet syrup and a fresh strawberry.  Nice touch.  The food was pretty good, I will say.  I didn't notice any difference between a waffle and a vanilla waffle, though - unless my palate is so jaded that I can't tell.  The coffee was pretty good.  It was all just so MUCH.  Obscenely so, really.  It's a good thing that I decided I wasn't going to count calories on vacation....  So why only 4 stars instead of 5?  Price was a bit steep, though you do get your money's worth.  And the server was a little on the \"cool\" side for me.  I don't mind people not hovering (in fact, I prefer it), but she was a little TOO standoffish, which can be just as much a turnoff.    The decor (all silvery with a 'metal' theme) was not up my alley, either.  Just very cold and industrial.  Would we come back?  Probably, if we feel the need to eat everything in the entire state of Nevada.  Otherwise, we'll share a plate.",

The service was bad thus when my Benedict showed up with bacon (which I ordered without bacon) & I told our waiter he took it to the back & was back with \"a new plate\"! Far from, all they did was removed the bacon & brought it right back & covered up the finger smudge marks in the decorative sauce around the outside of the plate! When u called them out our waiter lied to my face that that wasn't the case. When I told the manager he was kind enough to make things right. Very disappointed on my second visit ...",

The bartender who was a blonde girl would barely even look at us so we could order, and didn't offer to refill our coffee, yet was refilling the people who sat next to us after we had been sitting there. We could obviously tell she had an attitude with us because she was slamming things around and wouldn't even check on us. Finally another male bartender with glasses stepped in and helped turn our experience around. It was our first time here and we were very excited because we heard so many good things about Hash House. But instead we felt like a nuisance. We called that day, as soon as we got home, and spoke with the manager Donnie. He said whenever we wanted to come back he would take care of us and make it right. Today we called so we could go in, and they told us we could wait until Thursday when he got back in, and to send him an email in the meantime. We're both in the service industry and this whole experience has been very disappointing. We didn't write a Yelp review before because we just wanted to help internally without bringing you guys down, but apparently it doesn't matter either way.",

They brought me half of an avocado basically.   Service was great. I'm pretty upset they charged me 3.99 for half of an avocado. That's pretty ridiculous. I didn't want to take stars away for this....but ouch. Let's be realistic here! Also..maybe since they didn't have the bread I wanted, they could have maybe not charged me for that or something. I know it sounds ridiculous...but I won't be back just based on that overcharge. Food and service are great so you won't be disappointed there..but  that the overcharge is killer. Like going to Buffalo wild wings and getting charged $1 for a side of ranch. Haha how about some customer service.   I'll go spend my money at another delicious breakfast place I went to yesterday!

We have tried the Brown Sugar Banana, Snickers and Chocolate Chip pancakes and they are all fluffy, moist and delicious. My favorite is definitely the Brown Sugar Banana, though, because they make a nice crisp crust on top with the sugar. You don't even really need syrup.  We also had the waffles and French toast. The French toast came with a caramelized split banana on top and was totally amazing.  Of course we also had to try the Chicken and Waffles and the fried chicken Benedict. The waffles literally had bacon cooked inside them. The fried chicken is like one of the best I've ever tasted. It is crispy, flavorful and moist inside. IF YOU GO THERE, YOU MUST TRY IT.  The service was awesome. Very friendly, helpful and quick. Will probably come by here whenever we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "So my friends really wanted to come here so we decided to meet up with them. But when we sat down my friend looked on yelp and found out they close in about 40 minutes. I would have never guessed it tho because there were two big parties and a whole section of guests. But that was our bad, and they allowed us to sit down anyways. The host was really nice bc i told him my phone was dying so he tried finding me a seat with an outlet lol. Anyways we ordered quick and we were served fast. I couldn't believe how quick the food came out. Anyways after we got our food our server was no where to be found. I needed ranch and it took forever for her to come back to the table. I asked for ranch and it did not taste good. We get the check and the ranch is an extra $1.25!!!!! Our server didn't tell me!!!! I was livid. It took her forever to get our checks too. Like i totally understand at closing they have lot of things that need to be done in order for you to go home but still i expect good service all through the day. If they told us they close soon before we sat down i would have gladly went elsewhere. So besides like spotty service everything else was good. The food was so bomb and it was enough for me and my friend to share which i loved.  ~~~Ranch review~~~ Their ranch tasted like it came from a bottle. I usually expect more from restaurants. I could just bring my own bottle of ranch if they want to charge me $1.25... 3/10",

The food was okay but I could tell it had been sitting before our server brought it out to us. (It was rather lukewarm.) We ordered the smoked bacon, avocado, and onion scramble and the smoked salmon Benedict. The food was dropped off at our table...and we had no utensils to eat with! Coffee wasn't refilled very often either. I'd be more understanding if the restaurant was packed and busy but they weren't! Overall, it was a pretty disappointing experience.",

And that's why I'm leaving 4 stars instead of 5. Two tables of three were seated on either side of us about 10 minutes after we were seated and they got their food and were almost finished when we finally got our food. We were told by our server that our order got mixed in with a big tables order so it was taking longer. I could have given 2 stars, but the food was AMAZING as I said before.",

Do not come here if you aren't fairly hungry.  I am a fan of the corned beef hash, which wonderfully enough does not taste, nor look like dog food here. I really appreciate that attention to detail.

Eggs were great, toast was great, potatoes were great.  My only criticism is that the coffee was only ok.  I think I figured out the issue.  There is a portal to Idaho in the kitchen.  They have not been able to stop the flow of potatoes from this portal.  The only choice they have to keep the potatoes in check is to send out every order with 2 pounds of chunk potatoes.",

It's located off The Strip, but it's a great place for breakfast and brunch.  I came here with a fairly large party and we were seated almost immediately. With a table full of foodies, we decided to order several dishes to share. This allowed us to try a little bit of everything, which was fantastic! Some of the dishes that we ordered included the following: HH Famous Meatloaf, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, Corned Beef House Hash, Griddled French Toast, Roasted Pork Tenderloin, and Chicken and Waffles. My favorite was the Griddled French Toast; it was airy and fluffy, with a nice crisp at the edges. It included baked bananas drizzled with banana cinnamon cream and pecan maple syrup. The combination was absolutely orgasmic and I highly recommend it! Another dish that stood out was the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The benedict came with sort of scrambled eggs, versus the typical poached egg that I am used to. It was different, but delicious. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and the sauce was unique and flavorful.  The portions were humungous and very nicely presented. Their drinks are also a hit too--especially their kiwi watermelon lemonade and various mimosas! Our waitress was patient and courteous too, so don't forget to visit this place the next time you're in town!",

It is so good that I don't care for the wait or how many calories is in this food. I've tried their chicken and waffles, a few flapjacks and hashes but eventually decided that Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict is still my favorite. I love taking friends and family here.   The portions here are HUGE! My last time here, I was with a group of friends who are from out of town. I gave the guy friends a challenge to finish the food from their plate. All the guys thought that this could be easily done and happily took the challenge. Of the 5 guys at the table, only 2 where able to finish. The rest almost passed out from trying. The only other girl at the table and I both finished about half and I felt full the rest of the day.",

    "text": "Better known as \"the establishment responsible for robbing me of half a day's worth of tourist time.\"    How, you ask? Well...  (Cue dream harp flashback sequence music.)  We started the day off with every intention of being productive. Woke up at a decent enough time (especially considering that we were on vacation mode), and headed to brunch at the Hash House.   Loved the decor (sleek and modern), and was tickled by their slogan - \"Twisted Farm Food\" (farm fresh food with a 'twist').  After perusing the menu, I knew immediately that I wanted the Fried Chicken & Waffles Tower. How could I not?! I mean, a TOWER of fried goodness! I shot down my hubby's attempt to share an order, determined to take down the tower (and save the princess?) on my own.   My dish arrived, and I was in foodie heaven. Laced with crispy bacon pieces, these waffles were no ordinary Eggos. And the fried chicken. Oh. My. Goodness. Infused with sage and fried to absolute perfection -- I would have no qualms with eating THESE chicken pieces out of a red and white bucket with my bare hands! Thankfully, we were provided with silverware so this was not necessary. I used my knife and fork to tackle my fried food tower like a civilized person thankyouverymuch.  As could have been predicted, I was defeated by the tower of gluttony. Though undoubtedly delicious - I couldn't eat another bite. In hindsight, I probably should have agreed to split an order. Alas, I had once again become a victim of 'eyes bigger than tummy' syndrome.   Here's where the details get sketchy. We headed home (or did we go for Boba first?), and somehow made it to one of the bedrooms. We each felt the need to (Falsely) assure one another that we were not going to fall asleep. I wanna say we put in a DVD. I wanna say my sister and I were even munching on some Swedish Fish as an attempt to further perpetrate our 'we're totally normal' act.   I wanna say we succumbed to food coma pretty instantaneously.   It must have been a pretty sad sight when my mom walked in to find all of us completely unconscious -- my sister and I laid out on the bed (with an, ahem, EMPTY Swedish Fish bag between us), and our respective men sprawled out on the floor (one of them with his belt and pants button undone to accommodate his fullness).   Oh, and I should mention - this was FIVE hours later. We had taken a FIVE HOUR midday siesta, thanks to our Hash House feast. We were forced to throw in the towel on any plans we originally had for the day, and made a pact to one another that we would not let this happen again.  (Music screeches to a halt.)  Until, that is, we met the 30-inch pizza. Alas, a story for another day...",

I back track on the 15 fwy. to Sahara Ave. make a left and begin a long drive down towards the parts of town that did not exist to me since I never really leave the strip. The girls are getting weary of where we're going and keep their eyes peeled for Torrey Pines st. I see the tin looking architecture and pull into the parking lot at 11: 10. The parking lot's full. Don't people in Vegas work on Tuesday's? We walk in and look at the wall of famous people who ate there and the girls call me over and say, \"Hey, Bjork's eaten here, look.\"  I run over and to my pleasant surprise is a menu signed by Bjork and I instantly knew, this place was going to be great.   The food was awesome, big, and one of a kind. Our waiter was cute, knowledgeable, and friendly...and MALE! Hey now! I can't even get that combination in the clubs. He recommended the brown sugar banana pancakes which were delicious, but my Australian cousin ordered the Chicken Benedict because it was on Man vs Food and I got a hit of that and was addicted. The sauce on that is heaven! The only thing that could've made it better was Bjork serving it to me in that ridiculous swan outfit and then singing \"It's Oh So Quiet....shhhh! shhh!\" LOL!    Go there if you're in Vegas. Take your children and tell them this is what they serve in Heaven and if they don't behave they can go to Hells kitchen where everyone yells at them with Brit accents and makes them feel unworthy.

You can get better quality food at other brunch spots for cheaper. Here's a breakdown of our 1st visit: Atmosphere is always crowded & loud! Very loud! They pump up the music so loud that the hostess had to yell at the top of her lungs for parties and if you're seated near her it's all you hear throughout your meal. It ridiculous! Turn the music down a little and people will be able to hear the host and have a nice conversation without yelling over the music! Food, hubby ordered his usual corned beef hash and let me tell u, don't order it if you're a corned beef hash lover! With the name hash house you'd expect their hash to be awesome. But it was just pieces of shredded fresh corned beef on top of seasoned potatoes, topped w/ shredded cheese & green onions. It's not even \"hashed\" together! They serve it with a lame dry biscuit and a piece of watermelon & strawberry. I ordered their popular menu item, banana French toast. Now this dish was good and had 3 big thick slices topped with cooked banana. This is the only reason they get 1star.  So for both dishes & 2 drinks bill was $40 w/tip. Never coming here again, so not worth the $ or the crowd u have to deal with.",

It took more than 15 minutes to get drinks and another 10 before we could order.  The waitress didn't know the kid's menu, so when we asked her a question about it, she said \"ummm\" and then guessed.  Our two year old finally got so hungry we asked for the \"emergency snickers\" that was advertised on the kids menu and was met by blank stairs from three different staff members.  One finally went to see if they could find one.  After 10 minutes I asked if we could just get some crackers or something.  They said they had none, but we could order fruit or a biscuit.  As I am writing this, the manager came over.  When we complained she snickered and asked us if this was our first time here.  She claimed that the food is fresh, so that's why it is taking so long.  Basically, food may be good, but if you never get it, what's the point.  Also, the music was so loud, our twoyear old spent the entire time covering his ears!",

But the most memorable thing about it was the taste.  The chicken tasted like dirty old grease.  When a customer takes a bite or two of a dish and then leaves the rest to be thrown away, shouldn't that send up a red flag that there is something wrong?  Me thinks there is tons of food being thrown in the garbage at this place which makes me dislike it all the more.",

Once to greet and take our drinks, once to drop off our food, once to see how we were doing and once to give us the check. Our drinks sat empty for about 15 minutes as she was no where to be found. Finally the bartenders saw us sitting there and refilled our drinks. We talked to them and saw them more then our own waitress.   Second time, our waitress was a little better. She had quite a few tables so she was busy. Though the Bussers and/or runners aren't the greatest. They drop off the plates in a rude manner and walk away. My girlfriend was talking to the runner as she literally just started walking away. How disrespectful! Food was awesome. Finally gave in and got the Chicken and Waffles. Not as impressed as I was hoping to be. But it wasn't bad.   Overall, the staff needs to take Customer Service 101, ASAP. As much rant as this place gets, you would think the service would be awesome and be proud to work, though unfortunately it's not even close to decent.",

Im not big on texas toast type bread (which is what my sandwich came with) but there definitely is plenty of bacon and the tomatoes were actually good (not like the typical pithy ones you get in a restaurant!). I was only able to eat half of my sandwich, so for $12, I got two meals :) Also.. Love the iced caramel mocha.. HUGE and that in itself is a meal...  Good service as well, attentive but not over the top",

If that kind of shotgun approach to service doesn't bother you, then go for it! Very loud head banging music, too...even at 8 am.",

    "text": "This place just makes me laugh - we had such a ridiculous time here.  The portions are so completely over-the-top, it's great fun and we definitely don't have anything like this up North.    Fried chicken.. with bacon waffles.. drenched with syrup.  I get the same look from everyone when I describe this to them.  It's a cross between absolute revulsion and incredulity - that I LIKED it?!  Yeah, we don't have fried chicken and waffles up here - that's a new combo.  But damn, it was good. It's I'm-on-vacation-and-what-happens-in-Vegas-stays-in-Vegas good.  The green fried tomato is stacked up in a tower, layered with goat cheese.  I have no idea what this is supposed to taste like, but it was just like very firm warm tomatoes, with goat cheese & balsamic.  Not bad, but nothing exciting beyond its portion size.  The crab cakes are more like crab patties.  They are burger sized, the biggest crab cakes I've ever seen.  Taste-wise, nothing to write home about, but not bad in the traditional sense either.  There were decent amounts of real crab meat in there, not just filler.  The hammered pork tenderloin comes served in a plate that is the size of the table-width.  No joke.  It made for a great late night snack.  I really enjoyed the complimentary biscuits - big, buff and buttered with honey.  Just the way I (now) like them.  I had to exercise considerable restrain in eating just one.    Arriving early enough on a Friday night at 6:30, we were able to get  a table right away.  The place was pretty packed by the time we left at 8:30.",

They had a pork roast scramble special once that I still fantasize about, but for me, it's mostly about the breakfast and the PANCAKES.  The blueberry pancakes are good but the banana brown sugar are AMAZING.  If you like pancakes, they are the best and worth every penny.  The vanilla waffle is pretty blah.  The mashed potatoes are crazy good.",

Sage fried chicken and bacon waffles with maple reduction... 2 stars. Roscoe's serves WAAAAAY better chicken and waffles. The chicken was dry and the waffles were too doughy. Where's the sage? The maple reduction was the best part about the plate but it stuck like hot glue so I couldn't get much from it. You absolutely need to ask for more syrup. The fried leeks were bitter.  Fried chicken eggs benedict... 4 stars. Sooo heavy but sinfully good. Very filling. The chipotle cream sauce really makes it. Good thing for the tomato bc it really cuts through the heaviness a bit.  Meatloaf hash... 5 stars! The meatloaf was sooo moist and tender. The biscuit is delicious with the homemade strawberry jam. Even though this place is known for their fried chicken benedict... I HIGHLY recommend the meatloaf hash.  The best thing about our meal? KIWI WATERMELON LEMONADE. It's beautiful and refreshing but too bad there are no refills. The nice waitress gave us refills of regular or strawberry lemonade so that was nice. You can take your lemonade to go!",

Along came a platter (two plates) worth of food presented and built like a house, e.g. bacon mash potatoes provided the foundation, then the biscuits were on-top supporting the Fried Chicken and Chiptole cream with peppers, scrambled eggs, griddled mozzarella.  There was so much flavor yet it all seemed to work out and agree with my palate.  However, I failed the Man vs Food battle, unlike Adam Richman, as I could not finish my plate.    My buddies ordered and enjoyed  the House Hashes with chorizo; however, one of the hashes came with fresh jalapenos, which of course, didn't quite flow well with him a few hours later.  =P",

This place is extremely popular and it does get packed. My friends and I waited a long time before we were seated which was understandable. All the eats are close together and there is outside seating available. It does get noisy so I would not recommend this place if you are looking for a more intimate setting.    I ordered the maple reduction chicken and when it came out I was not expecting how huge the portions would be! Honestly my plate alone was large enough to feed two people! It came with a homemade biscuit and a side of mashed potatoes all of which were delicious. One of my friends ordered the pancakes which was enormous! The prices are very fair considering the extremely large portions. I hear there is a location in San Diego also which I will visit soon!",

If this would've been taken care of in a decent time frame I wouldn't be giving them 2 stars but our waiter didn't check on us until the time for the frickin' check! We ate that huge quesadilla, sat around with no drink refills and then he finally brings the check which I told him to take the bacon off cause I wasn't paying for it.  Quesadilla - Good.

I got there early afternoon around 12 30pm and noticed that it was packed already with people waiting to be seated and some were even baking outside waiting to be seated.  The cute girls up front stated it would take an hour to an hour 15 minutes to be seated so i was like maybe i shouldnt wait but decided to stick around since there isnt much to do in vegas in the morning.  it took about 40 minutes and we were seated.  Ok i am getting to the important part the FOOD.  I ordered hamburgers for kids from the kid's menu and boy i was wrong to get each one their own burgers.  The burgers were so big that kids couldnt even manage to eat half of it.  So my advice get one burger per two children :).. Flapjack i ordered was huge as well i would say 3-4 people could easily eat this and i am a big guy with apetite.  Verdict fun to see such huge portions atmosphere was nice definitely worth going and checking it out.  I cant say the taste of breakfast was the best i have had though, but i enjoyed the experience.",

OK for a bar, not so much for breakfast.  I enjoy an off beat atmosphere as much as anyone.  But don't give me a headache with my breakfast.",

I have to say in my honest opinion i haven't had a breakfast that has ever or will ever compare to it again. I ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles. Huge Portion, enough to fill me up till dinner time! Bacon was cooked finely into the waffles which had carmelized or crystalized maple syrup on top of them, I thought how weird but good lord it was like a symphony of dankness on my palet. The fried chicken was very freshly cooked and on the plate there was a sauce for the chicken of the likes of which i cannot compare with any other. These combinations made for a breakfast I to this day wish i could enjoy over here in California. I heard there is one in San Diego but am unsure if its the same company or not. People rave about Roscoes Chicken and Waffles down here, which i have not had, but given the quality of this food and the way it was prepared i cant imagine that any other breakfast joint has anything on Hash House A Go Go. This is a must people. Manditory for any tourist or local to dine at. Very Original, Very Clean, Very well done! Thnx Hash House!",

    "text": "ive been hearing that this is the breakfast joint to hit up in vegas.  we went to this b/c i was so hungry after completing the first las vegas half marathon.  this place is away from the hustle and bustle of the strip on the west side of town.  it was a very good sign to see how busy this place was and how long the wait was.  just waiting outside and peaking into the heated outdoor eating area, you could see how enormous the plates were.  i should correct myself...they were enormous platters, not plates.  we were told that a party of 4 would be unable to sit in the bar area b/c the platters were huge.   i was impressed with the wide selection of breakfast items.  first off, going against the rules of post workout re hydration, i couldnt resist trying a libation from the mixed drink selection, why?  why not?  check this out...hash house bloody mary...premium vodka, bloody mary mix, fresh lemon juice, celery salt, Worcestershire and hot sauce, spicy pickled green beans (with extras ordered), 2 jalapeno stuffed olives, and a mt olive kosher petite dill pickle, with fresh cracked pepper sprinkled on top...f@ckin hella savory ...that won me there at that point. i ended up choosing the HH Famous Meatloaf with roasted red peppers, fresh spinach, and smoked mozzarella all on big chunks of fried potatoes.  my favorite and lovely dining companion ordered the Farmer's Daughter House Hash that came with two eggs your way, biscuit, watermelon, and portabello mushrooms, cheddar cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, etc. on also...big chunks of fried potatoes.  Both came on a huge skillet (which they called their \"smaller\" dishes...lies...they were huge...i just finished the leftovers 2 days later)  My other dining companion had a decadent omelet filled with smoked salmon and melted brie.  also, all our orders arrived with flaky biscuits, so you get to top it with some their own homemade strawberry jam (we ended up packaging some of the jam up for home...too bad it doesn't last long enough, not from me eating it all, but b/c it has no preservatives!!! this ranks high in my favorite breakfast places to eat.  i will definitely return here with my lovely dining companion to enjoy the other things on the menu, such as the sundried tomato, basil & goat cheese scrambled eggs, or the mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash, or even the roasted pork tenderloin, charred tomato, corn, baby green beans and mozzarella hash, and definitely for that damn bloody mary.",

I was expecting it to be somewhere on the strip, but luckily it was easy to find right off of Sahara. It's a stand alone building with it's own lot. As I was told, the restaurants specializes in breakfast, although you can order lunch or dinner food as well. Breakfast is served all day. Portions are gigantic! I mean, huge, so come hungry. Unfortunately, I didn't come starving. I ordered a some drink called Watermelon-Lemonade, I may have the name wrong, but if you mention it to your server, they'll know what your talking about. It was sooooo good. For my meal, I was plain Jane and ordered a flap jack. It's so big, it hangs over the plate. I literally ate half of the inside of the flap jack. For the service and overall food experience, I'd rate them 3 stars. I would definitely return again and probably order something completely different though. I wasn't too impressed with the flap jack.",

I have only had their breakfast, and I think it's fantastic. There were so many options on the menu, it took us quite some time to finally decide what to order! They also serve beer in a brown paper bag early in the morning, which is something only Vegas could get away with. I'm pretty sure that this will forever be a staple of my Vegas trips from now on. The only bad thing is that it didn't seem like they had a working a/c..so it was extremely stuffy, not to mention all the cigarette smoke from the casino was traveling up into the restaurant as well. There is a really long wait too, so you'll have to mentally prepare yourself to wait it out and practically suffocate before you are seated. I'd say that this restaurant is probably the best thing Imperial Palace has going for them.",

    "text": "Definitely a yummy and unique experience. Ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles plate to share with my wife. Two plump, juicy, flavorful chicken breast fried golden brown were served over 4 Belgian waffles and topped with fried leeks with a maple reduction and spicy chili oil with diced bell peppers. Simply amazing. All of the flavors worked really well together and the portion was more than enough for 2 adults (we could have actually shared the waffles with our 3 year old. We got him a kids lil tractor breakfast: One giant pancake, scrambled eggs, and a slice of bacon. He ate 1/2 of the pancake and the bacon. So the only thing that we didn't love was the price. They kind of gauge you on the drinks and the kids meal prices -- which aren't exactly comparable to  other restaurants. I totally understand, \"you get what you pay for,\" and don't get me wrong, the food was great. But a $40+ bill after tip for one adult meal, one kid meal, and 2 coffees is kind of a bit much. It cheapened the experience. Oh, and even though it doesn't state it on the menu, the waitress said there was a $3 split charge. She  tells us if we order something else that they can count it as a meal and waive the split -- I know, it didn't make sense to me either. So we order a side of scrambled eggs al a carte -- which we didn't eat -- and never got the plate split. I kind of felt tricked into spending a whole $3 more. Again, 3 bucks not a big deal, but it cheapened the experience.",

    "text": "I had heard so much about this place and was extremely excited to go here.  I went on my birthday for brunch and was sadly disappointed.  Now I will admit that this place is probably as amazing as everyone says, but my experience was awful.  First off the waiter gave us a song and dance about the food being fresh and the wait might be longer.  I expect fresh food and don't try and give me an excuse why you are slow.  We waited 50 minutes for our food.  The waiter mixed up all our drinks giving my wife pepsi when she asked for diet three seperate times.  If I wasn't looking so forward to this meal I would have walked out.  My wife ordered the chicken and brie sandwich which was bland and had hardly any brie on it.  Don't bill your sandwich as a chicken and brie and then hold the brie.  I got a meatloaf sandwich and the meatloaf was delicious but the amount of fried cheese on it was absolutely disgusting.  The best choice was my friend who got the Sage chicken and waffles.  Obviously this place has one or two tricks up it's sleeve and it is wise to stick with them.  I should have got the chicken and waffles too.  To top it all off we used a $50 coupon from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhalfoff.com&s=0922705b7543b7ae4e7d0b4e45f8ab6016b94bc4059c8f033ddd18163b63f969\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">halfoff.com</a> and it seem like they had never seen one before.  It took them 15 mintues to figure out our check.  Ridiculous and did not meet all the hype.",

Spot her and remind her about salads and appetizer, and reminded her... don't bring dinner order until we can enjoy salad and appetizer. She acknowledged this. Got salad. When done. Got appetizer. Two bites in and we were served COLD and dry chicken fried steak. Waitress disappears. Asked for more gravy. By the time she came back, asked for to go boxes. Drops check and disappears. This was also the case at two adjacent tables. Finally the guy from another table finds her to ask for a dessert menu. We also wanted dessert, since we didn't have our dinner.  She brought my husbands cheesecake and never returned. Boxed up our food, put my card in the tray with the bill, while holding to go bag. She shows up with my dessert. Asked for to go box... we want to go. TWO HOURS!!!  No apologies. Told the manager... he said it is his fault.  WHATEVER that means. Totally insincere.  All of this in a pretty empty restaurant. Huge section empty.",

Haha, it's been at least a year since the last time! Yep, I am a person of my word. Last time I went here with my son it took about 20 minutes to get greeted and get something to drink! It's like the servers were like \"I ain't taking that table\"....a boring little 2 top and one being a kid. Well I'm glad it finally took that one time to tell me to never return. Last few times the service was crappy as well. Do these servers not like getting good tips? Or do they get paid good hourly that they just don't care? Regardless, this place sucks. Not worth the money.  They over flavor everything! Seriously lay off the Rosemary!",

The Benedict for starters was not a Benedict, I wish it was served with fried eggs instead of scrambled, runny yolk would have been awesome amongst all of the other things. I loved the chipotle cream sauce and fried cheese on it so much that now I'm on a diet trying to work this thing off my waist line.

I didn't want to eat anything heavy because I thought we were going to be at The Hoover Dam for a couple of hours. I ordered the Grilled Portabello sandwich $12.95. It had roasted red peppers, Basil Pesto, griddled goat cheese on a fresh baked bun. It was good but I think I haven't acquired the taste for goat cheese yet. It had an after taste to it. The sandwich was huge but what isn't over here LOL.  My brother, aunt and cousin were really happy with their meals as well!",

Food AND Rachel Ray's Vacations and were really pleased with the results when we stopped for a late breakfast.  They actually have a \"late breakfast\" menu.  Eggs are only served scrambled for late breakfast, but that was fine with us.  They're served a little soft -- \"custard style\" I've heard it called before -- so if you want them firmer, you should probably order them that way.  But they're great as they serve 'em.  Portions are just as huge as you've heard they are.  And the prices are so reasonable it doesn't matter if you don't eat it all and have no refrigerator in your hotel room.  You won't feel like you've spent tons of money on food you couldn't finish.  They charge a split charge ($2.50) and if you're eating with someone who wants the same thing, it's probably worth splitting it.  We ordered a corned beef hash (served on halved potatoes with a biscuit the size of a large orange) and french toast combo (served with eggs, 2 pieces of bacon and a banana sliced in half and roasted, served in the skin), and both were great.  And the service was so friendly and quick!  We went on an off day (Wednesday) and waited just five minutes, but I can imagine a longer wait during busier times.  Still, it's worth a wait and I'm sure we'll be back next time we're in Las Vegas!",

I have been there three times and after the third visit, I was convinced that it was like a game that was played by the servers - as if that was their \"thing\" - to be rude, slow and discourteous.  All in all its a very unpleasant experience and a location I would say NEVER GO TO!  I think that they will have to close down this location at some point because the rude behavior of the servers will alienate 90% of return customers.  The only reason why I went back for a second and third dinner was because the last two times the restaurant was already selected by a group of friends - so I had to go.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

My friends were scared of some of the things they brought to the table because they were so big! Fortunately, I got a scramble which wasn't that big. French toast is HUGE and so are the pancakes! Food is pretty good, but I finish it. I don't think I'll go back because I'll feel bad for wasting so much food.",

I also heard they had a giant pancake there - and we all know that I love a good pancake.  HOLY COW the pancake was the size of a pizza pie! And so good, I might add. My man ordered a steak sandwich. It was so big, it came to the table with a steak knife through it, instead of a toothpick. We had a great time laughing at ourselves for attempting to eat the over-sized food.   The portions may have been enormous, but the prices were surprisingly moderate. Definitely a fun place to check out!",

    "text": "I want to love this place, but in the end I ended up just liking it.   My husband and I went here to try something different from our normal breakfast/brunch haunts like The Coffee Cup in Boulder City or one of the champagne brunches at the Bellagio or Mandalay Bay.   With that said, the place was ok. There was a bit of a wait and for some reason the chef either really likes rosemary or his supplier gave him an excess that was unreasonable that he had to get rid of it somehow.   I ordered the chicken and waffles and my husband ordered the meatloaf hash. For drinks I had the bloody mary and he had the orange juice since he had to go into work in a few hours. You can't really complain about orange juice and the bloody mary was just ok, the whole time I was drinking it I just kept thinking about the bloody mary I had at Rosemary's, which was AWESOME!, and I guess nothing could really compare to that so I can't really complain.   As for the food, the meatloaf hash....well I think they got the order wrong because it actually looked like it was a sausage hash or something like that. My husband gave me a bite and I just couldn't believe that that bite contained anything that would resemble meatloaf. One it was pale, and it was somewhat rounded like it was a chicken sausage. He said that it was meatloaf but honestly, unless it was a chicken or turkey meatloaf I just couldn't understand why the \"meat\" was pale like that. As for my chicken and waffles, it was ok. Maybe i'm used to Roscoe's in LA, but the chicken was dry and the waffles was just too soft for me. The only saving grace was the fried leeks. The long piece of rosemary running through it was just ridiculous! With every bite all I smelled and tasted was the rosemary, I thought it was supposed to be \"sage\" fried chicken? Why not have fresh sage on the dish? The dish was bearable after my husband took that branch of rosemary off my dish and onto his side of the table. I felt bad cause he also had a branch of rosemary on his plate however it would have been considered a \"mini\" compared to the HUGE branch I got on my plate. New York Times Favorite or whatever they claim on their menu?!?...Either I got screwed on the chicken and the extra rosemary order the day before or maybe the New York Times critic was high when he/she decided to make it a favorite. Sorry I'm just not a fan of inedible garnishes that just don't make any sense on a plate.   The ambiance and building itself was pretty cool, the staff was dressed as greasers, you could see their \"real\" hair under thier wigs. haha. For the same price of breakfast for the both of us we could have gotten champagne brunch at either Mandalay Bay or Bellagio and that is with just one of us getting a drink, just one drink!    We want to love this place so we will try it again and order different things, hopefully it won't be as bad as it was our first time.",

The wife had the French Toast w/ Eggs and those are SPECTACULAR! We are super happy we had start the day here, it gave us plenty of energy for the day and we definitely had to skip lunch.

The location does not serve it justice since it is outside of the hustle and bustle of the strip; but it was great overall. The Peach Italian soda was to die for and I was savoring every drop. Hash House's decor was industrial, but quaint at the same time.   The portions are huge!! I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Hardwood Smoked Bacon Waffles, and its not the plain meal you may expect. Three pieces of juicy chicken breasts sitting on top of two Bacon Belgian waffles. All of it is anchored with a steak knife and drizzled with a spicy maple syrup. It was too much for me, but it was delicious overall. The only turnoff where the green onions on top, but they can easily be taken off.   If you are in Las Vegas, you have to come there!! Its the first pit stop to make when you are hungry!!!",

The banana pancakes were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The edges were kind of crispy (probably because it had been soaked and fried in butter... mmm).  If you are visiting Vegas, I would recommend sharing a dish since you WILL have plenty of leftovers... and as much as I try to avoid wasting food, it's hard to eat leftovers when traveling (no fridge, no microwave, etc.).

The wait did take a little bit and for that I assumed it was only because they did not have enough servers but I cannot confirm that.    Like everyone said the portions are huge but my sister and I shared a hash and even got a side of the fried sage chicken which was awesome.   The coffee was very good and didn't require my usual amount of cream and sugar for taste.  I thoroughly enjoyed this meal.",

Fortunately, we were able to try some of the other dishes that our tablemates ordered.  Those were definitely better.  But the $2.50 surcharge for sharing a plate is pretty bullshit if you ask me.

The sage fried chicken and waffles were pretty bomb dot com. (yes, i just used that, don't judge) It was delish. A definite must try! If I come back here this is what i would get. soooo good. my 2 friends shared the fried chicken Benedict but again same complaint... biscuits and mash potatoes a whole mouth of starch=hard to breath. the other 2 friends got a scramble and a hash which is how you wanna go if you want something light...er (ha) Both were very satisfied.   They have pretty stellar drinks. I got the kiwi watermelon lemonade. OMG so good. It comes out pretty at first but then you mix it and it looks like sewer water. SOOO good though...   I'm pretty sure there's ALWAYS a wait so be ready. This location is really far from the strip but I'm assuming less people that the one on the strip.

    "text": "I'm going to round this up to a 3 star rating because I've never really ate at a place quite like this.  They actually have really interesting stuff on the menu that sound really appetizing.  I wish I could've just ordered everything I wanted, but there was no way no how i'd be able to do that.  My BF and I decided to split a plate since it was our first meal of the day.  We had the rosemary fried chicken with bacon waffle and leeks- $14.95.  It's definitely not chicken and roscoes!!!!  The chicken was extremely dry, hard and almost inedible.  Waffle was too thick and not moist and fluffy; it was also dry.  The only saving grace on that plate were the leeks, and I would say it was there more for decorative purpose.  I'd pass on this dish.  We also had two eggs, sunny side up, for an additional $2.95.  This excluded the $2.50 fee they add on for those who split a plate.  The rest of my party enjoyed pancakes and the basics!.  Everything is just ginormous!!!  The pictures posted give a rime example of the sizes/portions.  Even the kids pancake is huge, and definitely not bad for 4.95?  It was cheap!    The restaurant is pretty spacious and I appreciate the big booths they have.  I can't really say the decoration stood out to me though.  I can't pinpoint anything specific about it.  Service was slow and rushed at the same time, if that even makes sense.  She took really long to greet us, but when she finally did she was eager to take our orders.  No \"good morning\", or \"welcome to hash house\".  It was my first time there so it would've been nice to have been greeted with a welcoming hello.  After she took our orders, it was a realllllllly long time before we saw her, or our food.  I flagged someone down inquiring about our food and then they finally came out, cold.  Blah.  Overall, I think I want to give this place another shot, but it will probably be a while before I venture out again.  In the mean time i'll stick to the more \"normal\" breakfast spots out there....  Oh yea, btw, Happy Thanksgiving to all my friends, all the people I've been blessed enough to cross paths with, all the people I have yet to meet, and most importantly my family! Thankful to have everyone of you in my life!  Enjoy",

We drove from Irvine to SD JUST for Hash House! The wait was only 15 minutes long and it was his first time there. He ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and I ordered the Corned Beef. We also had the Blood Orange Soda, which got us so addicted to it that he searched and found it at a store in Orange County. The food was just as good and we picked our bellys up and walked out of the restaurant proudly with a huge grin on our face. We stopped by the SD Wilderness Park after and burnt off our lunch walking and skipping (not really because we were so full we could barely skip) around like little kids.

    "text": "I went to Vegas over Memorial Day weekend. One of my friends mentioned he saw Hash House A Go Go on Man vs. Food and wanted to check it out. Little did we know the entire city of Vegas had the same idea. We went on Sunday at noon. There was an hour wait for a table of five. I was fine with the wait since that probably meant the place was good.   We put our names on the list and went next door to Vamp'd for a drink while we waited. I recommend doing this if the wait is more than an hour. Vamp'd is a rocker bar. Lots of rock memorabilia on the walls, guitars, chopper behind the bar, and a coffin telephone booth (kind of cool, but creepy when you get in it). Very cool place to check out. And it made our wait go by fast. Hash House tells you their pagers sometimes don't work next door, but we didn't have a problem. Our table was ready, but they wouldn't seat us without our entire party. Two of us stayed at Vamp'd to pay our bill, which took 5 minutes. Good thing it didn't take longer because they were ready to give up our table.  Just be ready when your pager goes off!!!   We sat down and it took a few minutes for our waiter to come over. Once he did, he was very helpful. I thought the ambiance was great. Everything that passed our table looked delicious! It was a tough decision on what to get. I ordered the roasted Chicken, garlic, onions, asparagus and rosemary House Hash. Our food took about a half hour. When my food came out barely warm, slightly cold I was a little disappointed. The Manager on duty came over and gladly had the cook make me a new dish. Mine was good, the chicken was a little dry. Could have used some sauce. There is A LOT OF FOOD for one person to eat. I highly recommend sharing a meal if your not a big eater. Or get a to-go box and give it to a bum.   I would definitely go back. I think they have a lot of creative dishes. I will order something different next time. Everyone else liked their meal.  Pros: Atmosphere, food selection, their mango margarita, friendly wait staff  Cons: The wait (even though it is worth it)",

I always share my plate with someone because its way too much food for me. I think for the amount of food the prices are reasonable and the staff is always attentive and friendly. I will keep going to this place whenever I have a chance. Mimosas are always good here but I wish they had bottomless mimosas.",

I believe it's a great Vegas staple as far as good and plenty (huge) plates are concerned.  When I'm famished from a long night out this fresh food restaurant is a great way to replenish your reserves, then take a nap (you'll need one). Breakfast is best deal from the chicken & waffles to their egg specialties. The food has a homemade feel and that's a good thing, however, NO SUBSTITUTIONS!",

Thanks to my handy Yelp app. I easily found Hash House a GoGo and is forever in my app's debt. First of all, this place has moxie. The staff are fun and have character. The menu ranges from run of the mill (eggs, bacon and toast) to original masterpieces (snickers pancakes), of course there is room for plenty of crazy as well (O'Hare of the Dog, which consists of a 24oz Budweiser and a side of bacon). I loved the drink choices, lots of creative mimosas! Hash House will become a new tradition for Saturday morning, I can't wait to return. Word to the wise, show up before you go into starvation mode, you will be waiting for at least 20 minutes.",

Oh, and their waffles. Oh! And their french toast.  Force yourself to go here sparingly, else you will end up with a fat sack around your middle...which might actually be okay considering you acquired it from HH's crazy good food.  P.S.

Those two items are (or should be) considered a HHGG signature dish and drink. The chicken is fried, yet moist, not too salty. The waffle it comes with has a nice crisp texture with a fluffy inside. The Bloody Mary is zesty and well garnished with the RDA of vegetables. It will get you where you want to be.  I'm curious of those who have had less than a stellar experience at this location. I've dined here a few times and have yet to be disappointed. I would consider the wait worth it. The staff is always spot on. Come Hungry, you probably won't need to eat the rest of the day.  For the herbivore, the menu has a far share of salads as well. Two entree's, two adult beverage's and a tip is about $55.   Be careful of the rosemary sprig art piece that garnishes most items, it could poke your eye out.  Regardless of that, a total recommend. 4 stars.",

Thanks Elnino F. for organizing this breakfast and for letting us take advantage of your gift certificate! The other major players at the table were Jieun L., Sun M., and Oliver M. There was only one lucky player who walked away without the Bubble Guts.   I ordered a Farm Benedicts with the Sage Fried Chicken cause I wanted to do it Man v. Food style. There was not enough chicken to go with the amount of eggs, biscuit, and mashed potatoes on the plate. The biscuit was dry. The chicken and spinach was good. The slice of pineapple and orange was probably the best thing on the plate. I had a Fresh Lemonade Mimosa to drink. It was ok.  I guess I will have to come back to give them another try since I also bought a gift certificate from Sunny Dining Deals. I wanted to give 2 stars cause the service was great, but 4 out of 5 got sick so I couldn't do it.",

But it wasn't, it was just...ordinary. Which makes me sad. Maybe I shouldn't have got the scramble, it was just boring and plain, there was no kick to it or anything that made it special. I tried a friends 'Andy's Fried Chicken and Eggs Benedict' and it was also just boring tasting to me.   The portions are huge though, if you are staying at a hotel I would recommend sharing a plate, because you won't have anywhere to put your leftovers. I MAYBE finished half of my food. They do charge a split-plate charge, which is just absolutely ridiculous to me. They should offer lower portions sizes at lower prices, but that's just my opinion.   Also our server was kind of rude. We went with a group of 8 and she brought out one bill. When we told her we needed the bills seperated she got all pissy. Why would you just expect a group of young adults to pay one bill? Give me a break lady.",

Upon arrival...I loved how the place looked...a very Midwest look to it. Bf and I arrived around 10:30 for breakfast and the place was packed. Luckily we were just two people, seated right away.  We ordered the Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict (Man vs. Food favorite) and banana nut flapjacks.   We should have shared but didnt think the flapjacks would be that big. The benedict is enough for two people to finish. First bite of the Benedict was amazing! I especially loved the grilled cheese atop the Benedict.  The banana nut flapjacks were well made. Bf liked how they were crispy and not soft and mushy on the outer layer.   Kimberley was out server. She was pleasant and came by to check on us and refilled our coffee without us having to ask. Oh by the way, coffee was good. Not your usual restaurant coffee. If it was, it was good quality then. :)  Overall great experience and great food. Will return on our next Vegas trip.",

The waitstaff were excellent- they were very attentive and kept our coffee and water refreshed.  The coffee was good.  My brother recommends the bloody marys, but we didn't sample them this trip.  We went for the classic corned beef hash.  The portions were enormous and were really good.  I would have preferred toast instead of the biscuit that it was served with, but this is a small quibble.  There was a lot of humongous plates of stuff being slung around, like chicken and waffles and a pancake big enough to use as a parachute.  The prices were very moderate for the portions and quality.",

Expect to wait as there is always a line, but there are plenty of things on the walls to keep you occupied while waiting to be seated.  Start with the Kiwi-watermelon lemonade, not only is it colorful, but tastes fantastic.  Then again ALL of their specialty drinks rock. This last visit my wife ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and I hand the Snickers Flap Jack with eggs and bacon.  The flap jack was bigger than the plate!

The price was about 15 which is decent for breakfast in vegas.  The only negative about the meal is that i was not abl eto take it to go being that i had not yet checked in.  the only down side is the service was very suspect.  but you are so involved in eat this huge plates of food, that you just seem to nto realize you are out of coffee until...",

    "text": "MY GOODNESS, this place is UBER busy. My friends and I went on a weekend around 12 PM. That was probably a HUGE mistake. There were so many people and they said the wait was well over an hour. I felt a bit sardined in there and the bar area was totally full. We decided to just order our food to go and to eat it in our hotel room.   I really wanted to try this place after it was featured on Man vs. Food, but I did not have high expectations because of the fact that I have been disappointed by many places I have seen on food network/travel channel. To my surprise, I was not disappointed in the food, but I didn't care for the wait. Even though we ordered our food to go, it took a while to get it out, but I guess it is better than waiting for a table, ordering and waiting again for the food.   So, there were 4 of us and we decided to get 2 dishes and split it. Thank goodness we did because those plates were GINORMOUS! We got the Griddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup ($12.95) and Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit ($15.95). Both were really good.   The french toast was surprisingly light and not too sweet, which I liked. it was topped a banana what was sliced in half and grilled. It looked really pretty when we opened up the box. The sage chicken was amazing too. Fried well and really flavorful. It was a very heavy breakfast, but it didn't feel that heavy. I would totally go there again to try other things on the menu.",

Moist, tender waffles with a piece of AMAZING bacon baked right into them. Everything drizzled with a sweet maple syrup, and then stacked high with bamboo skewers.  The presentation is phenomenal and the flavor even better.  I also get their watermelon kiwi lemonade every time, since it's been a special every time I go. Kiwi syrup, housemade lemonade, topped off with watermelon puree and a big ol' slice of ripe, fresh, cold watermelon. Can't beat that in the Vegas heat.  One of just a few Food Network favorite restaurants that really live up to the hype. It's open pretty late, too. Yay!",

My wife got that, and I got the Tractor Driver Combo with French Toast.  Our food came out on plates as big as my upper torso!  The Benedict was like a mountain!  It had a knife stuck in it and you couldn't even see the blade!  As far as flavor and texture, it was a little overwhelming.  Salty, sweet, spicy, oooey, gooey, thick and dry... you name it, it was on there!  The French Toast was good.  I would have appreciated a little syrup on the side.  I finished my french toast and I look over at Maple's dish and she didn't even put a dent in it!  We ended up taking it to go and eating it for lunch on the way home!  Skip the breakfast buffets and come here!",

I had the Roasted Chicken, garlic, onions, asparagus and rosemary hash. It was delicious although the chicken and biscuit was a bit dry. Had to get some water to help it down. I can't believe I finished most of this entree. Boyfriend had Fresh Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash. This one was pretty good, but I'm not a big fan of artichokes. It was definitely flavorful! Next time we will share a hash.  The service was okay. Waters weren't filled as frequently as we would like. Don't they understand we've been walking around in 110 degree weather!? It also took a while for us to get our waiter for the check and to give him the check after. Hopefully this won't be a problem when we come back next time!",

    "text": "Size matters.  But does it matter enough?  The first thing that strikes you about Hash House, even as your hostess walks you to your table, is the size of the breakfasts on the tables you walk past.  Ranging from ample to massive, the breakfasts seem to dare you to finish them.  Eggs Benedicts piled so high you have to peak around them to find your Bloody Mary.  Pancakes the size of a small trampoline.  You're going to need a bigger fork.  But this is Vegas, and there are at least a couple of dozen hotels offering massive breakfast buffets.  Here, eating your fill is not enough to knock your socks off.  So, Hash House, what else you got?  Well, as it turns out, they got pretty good food and a lot of attitude.  By \"attitude,\" I mean a mildly \"holier-than-thou\" approach to their menu, reminiscent of Prius owners' approach to their cars.  Hash House makes it a point of pride that nothing on the menu is quite what you expect.  They offer a variety of Benedicts, but none of them with the traditional hollandaise sauce because that would be so, you know, traditional.  (I know that's the reason, because I asked the waiter.)  Breakfast potatoes are mashed or crispy-roasted, but not hash browns.  \"Favorite\" scrambles (according to the menu) are salmon, chuck roast, and smoked chicken.  And if you're really curious, you can order the \"Old School Fried Mush.\"  (Don't ask me; I didn't order it.)  The service was friendly, but a little slow.  One of our party ordered hash with a poached egg on top.  The hash arrived, without the poached egg.  We asked for the egg.  Five minutes later, the server came over and told us that the chef had broken the egg and would have to cook another one.  Another five minutes, and the egg arrived.  Five minutes?  What, were they waiting on the chicken?  Anyway, the one thing you have to say about Hash House is that if popularity is a metric, they must be doing something right.  Our wait to be seated was only about 15 minutes on a Saturday morning, but judging from the size of the outdoor waiting area there must be times when the line outside is longer than the dining room inside.   Hash House is quirky, but definitely worth a try.",

We were seated immediately (arrived around 9:30am on a weekday). My daughter wanted to order Hash House's world famous Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles (Two sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks) so I knew I had to share it with her since there is no way she could finish it. Even between the two of us, we still had plenty of leftovers! It was the BOMB as how I remembered it! My hubby ordered the House smoked fresh salmon scramble with basil pesto, fresh tomato and melted brie cheese, seasoned crispy potatoes, biscuit, fresh fruit and he loved it (it was the perfect amount for him as he finished it all!). Prices are not cheap but you get tons of food and the quality of ingredients is top notch! Service was friendly and prompt as well. Wish there was a HH in Los Angeles but we'll just have to hit them up the next time we are visiting San Diego or Vegas again!",

The restaurant was really interesting and the atmosphere was great. My boyfriend and I ordered their famous Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade and our friend ordered the Strawberry Lemonade Margarita.  Since it says on the menu that the food might take a bit of time, we were anticipating the wait of our food. My boyfriend and I shared the Chicken & Waffles and Biscuit & Gravy side with our friend getting the Tractor Driver combo with french toast. Servers kept coming back to inform us of the wait times without us asking, which was good.  As our food arrived, we looked in awe at the presentation of the food. They were plated nicely for such humble food. As I took the first bite into the chicken, I knew that it was probably one of the best things I have eaten... IN MY LIFE! Yes a bold statement, but I believe this is True.  So overall, we were incredibly satisfied and my boyfriend and I will be coming back again next time we're in Vegas (probably every month or so). Our friend who went with us lives in Vegas and has already gone back!",

Everything from the short wait time thanks to making a reservation through OpenTable, to the amazing drinks in slanted souvenir glasses, to the largely oversized portions (which Nick gave us the heads up about before ordering)! All in all a great experience! Definitely a must-try if coming to Vegas! More worth it than the newly added location in the Linq ON the actual strip I feel as this one has been here much longer and gives you more of a country, home-town touch. When coming to Vegas, this is a MUST!",

Golden crispy skin and the meat was still moist in the middle. You can taste the hint herbs for added flavor. The waffles are very thick and dense. I had my bacon cooked inside the waffle so every bite was savory with many layers of flavors. I was only able to eat one piece of chicken and one waffle and I was bursting at the belly.   Hubby had a burger...not sure which one but he enjoyed his meal. We came a little before closing so restaurant was empty. No wait, food arrived quickly and server was friendly and attentive.",

    "text": "Well I have been anticipating on visiting Hash House A Go Go for over 3 years now, we do not frequent Las Vegas much since we don't gamble however we recently went for a quick trip.  From what I recall there are two locations in Vegas, one is located inside the LINQ casino but parking is no joke so we decided to hit this location.  When we first arrived there was quite a few people already waiting, I like seeing this, it means the food is pretty damn good.  The wait was not bad at all, possibly 20 minutes and it was a Sunday morning (sort of) so I was surprised it went that fast.  The entire time that I have been waiting to come here I had my mind on the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles, I mean damn everyone and their mama raves about it.  So as you can guess this is what I ordered and I ordered a Nitro Brewed Coffee, I needed the energy to match my hunger.  My wife ordered a breakfast item (I think Red Velvet Waffle though I may be wrong) and my two boys ordered the same thing which was some behemoth of a dish, I will have to get back to you on what it was but that thing was MASSIVE....  Okay SAGE FRIED CHICKEN & WAFFLES, here is the description:   **Two sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks**       To me I was like, Fried Chicken? Mmmm Yes. Bacon? Mmmm Damn right!  Bacon incorporated into the Waffle Tower? HOLY MOLY bring it on!  Oh what a damn disappointment my friends, the breading from the chicken breasts fell off as I tried cutting into it, they didn't coat it correctly and that sage, the flavor was almost invisible to my tastebuds.  The waffles were not crispy, they were super soggy and no it was not due to the maple reduction because it is separate and you pour the amount you want.        I have had Eggo Waffles that had more crunch to them but then again I control the temperature on my toaster.  I felt so let down that I questioned what happened, was it an off day for their cook?  Was the normal cook on vacation and backfilled with the dishwasher?  I tried mustering up excuses so I didn't feel like I lost $18.99 on chicken & waffles, I could've done that at the casino.  Since then I have shared my experience with a few people who adore this dish and they all said the same, it had to have been an off day or cook on vacation....Well I guess I have to chalk it up to that, culinary is not for everyone, you either have the skills that pays the bills or you don't and this time around whoever concocted my food didn't pay any bills.....",

I do enjoy the ambience, and the unique menu, that for sure keeps me coming back!   My husband  and I decided to go in yesterday for an early lunch while we were waiting for my car to be washed. The service was fine, and our waitress was very attentive to our needs. My husband ordered the red velvet pancakes, along  with a side of cheesy eggs, and bacon. I decided to go with the chicken Benedict, this dish is one of the best sellers the waitress said, so why not try something different, right ?   Sadly I was not impressed, I do wish that they would've noted on the menu that the dish was a bit spicy.  By the time the food came I was super hungry, so I did take a few bites, but honestly this dish had way toooooo much going on for me!  The sauce was creamy and spicy, the mashed potatoes on the bottom, the fresh peppers, the eggs, I was all over the plate trying to get a complete bite, but it was basically impossible. That just let me to picking at it, and I hate eating like that ! I did finally end up sending the dish back, not because it did not taste well, it just wasn't to my liking of flavor.  I think I would've enjoyed a  simpler dish. I have had the mashed potatoes before, along with the meatloaf, and that was really great! Guessing this case bigger is not always better.  As for his dish, pancakes were very good, not to sweet but just right! I do wish they were fluffier though! I'm sure I'll be back as this was really an issue with what I ordered! They were nice enough to take it off the check, they did offer me something else, just Had no time!",

With inventive flavors like the blueberry lemon curd pancake, it's hard to go wrong with anything here. If you're in the mood for a decent Bloody Mary, then HHAGG has your back.

I prefer my waffles to be crispy, so they were ok.   I absolutely loved my brown sugar banana flapjacks. If I had a bigger stomach, I would have finished it all. I'm already wanting to go back to eat it again.  The red velvet flapjacks were also delicious! It's a tough choice to pick between these two, and I'd probably stick with the brown sugar banana.",

Sunday's are one of the busiest days here, they now have reservations on line or you can call.  Foods giant sized and delicious.  Reasonably priced at 10 for a giant pancake -15 with the combo (eggs and potatoes). Chicken and waffles I think we're 18ish.   Check them out, it's worth it!!",

We were like okay.... Hi? Table of 5... Then we were told it'll be a few minutes meanwhile the entire dining room was practically empty with 2 active tables. That's a little ridiculous isn't it? We waited at least 15 minutes before being seated and then the waiter came a few minutes after to greet us.  Nick was definitely very good with customer service as he told is the portions are huge and kept coming back to check up on us every few minutes. The food was okay... Not as good as I thought it would be with the thousands of reviews.  - Sage fried chicken and waffles(chicken was dry and flavorless almost) but the waffles were amazing. I had bacon in it. - Sage fried chicken benedict (chicken was even more dry than above dish and scrambled eggs were smacked between everything on a film like layer) - Chicken pot pie (omg... It was so good but it was a little too thick. The sauce needs to be thinned out just a little bit. I hated the \"crust\" as this was like bread and kind of dry rather than the flaky crust) - Waffles with scrambled eggs and ham (standard) - Country fried chicken steak (just a lot of food, not complaining but it was good)  Honestly, this place is good for it's portions.",

    "text": "Opting out of setting the table, doing dishes and worrying about how long the Turkey should be cooked it was as a party of thirteen that Thanksgiving took place at Hash House A Go-Go in 2018, the previous year's menu offered again at the same price and around $20 per person (including drinks, tax and tip) more than enough to send everyone home stuffed.  Selecting the West Sahara location this year instead of Henderson, reservations made several weeks in advance assuring a table at 11:30am with every other seat in the house packed, it was into a side room with other large parties that guests were led, a pre-planned order avoiding indecision and seeing Food delivered in less than twenty minutes.  No stranger to HHaGG or Midwestern Thanksgiving, the Restaurant out of San Diego doing an excellent job at recreating the plates and portion sizes seen back home in Ohio, it was first that six jumbo Biscuits were split and topped in Butter and Jam, the fluffiness improved upon from last time while three \"Big O' Turkey Pot Pies\" took the same Dough and rolled it thin to create a rimmed bowl that was filled with tender Vegetables and roast Turkey plus plenty of Mashed Potatoes and Gravy around the base.   Predictably watching Detroit lose to Chicago while dining, another annual tradition dating back to childhood, it was next that Hash House's Roasted Turkey Dinner took center stage, the $17.99 plate easily enough to feed two adults or more with a variety of Thanksgiving favorites including plenty of dark and light Meat plus grilled Corn and particularly good Stuffing.  Passing on Pumpkin Pie but certainly not ignoring America's favorite Squash it was in two orders of each that lunch concluded with Pumpkin Pancakes and Bread Pudding, the former a fluffy hubcap drizzled in Cream Cheese Frosting with a sidecar of fake Maple Syrup while the Bread Pudding was changed from 2017 and cut into slices before baking which helped make it less dry even before liberally adding warm Caramel Sauce.  ***1/2:  Improved from last year's Henderson experience Thanksgiving at Hash House a Go-Go offers value proportionate to quality and good service plus plenty of specials in addition to their usual menu all while allowing guests to watch the game and forget about doing dishes.",

Perfect to share with people. Definitely in love with  their smoked bacon waffles and fried leeks. The little bit of tiny bites of bacon inside of crispy waffle & fried leeks, and you eat it all together with fried chicken breast (crispy outside and juicy chicken meat inside). What more could you ask for a perfect brunch meal like this? The taste of savory fried chicken & waffle with sweet syrup pouring all over and every bite in my mouth is like heave. It's so delicious yet very filling. This is a highly recommenced item and it definitely hits the spot!",

Easily the size of a large pizza and about 1/2 inch thick. 3 people could easily share it, so order accordingly. I ate as much of it as I could, which was barely 1/4 of it!   For as big as it was, it was cooked perfectly all the way through which is hard to do with thick pancakes! Golden brown and delicious!

Even though their waffles and chicken themselves were good, all that extra stuff they put on top (I think it's herbs or onions) is nasty! I wasn't able to eat it confortably. I jus came to the one here in Vegas and to begin, everyone was soooo nice! A+ for customer service here. The lady in the front with the tattoos was no nice and accommodating, and our waiter was very patient and pleasant! (sorry, didn't catch their names). We were celebrating a birthday and they brought our birthday girl a red velvet waffle with ice cream! It was so delicious! I would for sure buy this next time if they sell it, I didn't see it on the menu, I might've missed it. Now as for the food, my boyfriend got the chicken pot pie, and it was amazingly good! Hands down the best chicken pot pie I have ever had! I highly  recommend it. It is creamy, not dry and has a whole lot of different veggies. I got the eggs Benedict with the chicken and chipotle sauce. I liked it, but I probably wouldn't get it again. It was a bit spicy. Each plate was about $17.",

With their food, they can make the place seem more high scale and still keep a casual vibe (since it's brunch). The portions could be a little smaller.

    "text": "Some people come to Las Vegas to gamble. I come to sample a wide variety of food. Breakfast at Hash House will leave you wanting to come back and try more things on their menu.   I had the sage fried chicken with bacon mashed potatoes and a biscuit. The chicken surprised me because I was expecting the more traditional salty crispy fried chicken (I'm sure that what I got is the same as what they  serve with their famous chicken and waffles). But instead of salty, it had a nice sweetness from a maple reduction. As good as it was, I missed the saltiness. But that's just me. It was crispy and tender and just fine. The mashed potatoes were great, eggs were just ordinary eggs, and I thought the biscuit was a bit heavy but their homemade strawberry jam was yummy.   I also had a Bloody Mary, and there was a flavor in their house made mix that didn't work for me. I did love the pickled green bean served with the cocktail.   So, kind of a mixed review, but I would go back again because the menu is pretty awesome.",

    "text": "I went here for a corporate breakfast on a Friday morning. After we were seated the server took our drink order. My coworker and I ordered a glass of prosecco and a water. It took at least ten minutes just to get our water, and over a half hour to get our glass of prosecco. When we got our waters we did not have any straws, so when we asked one of the buss boys for a straw he quickly replied \"that's not my job, I'll get your server\" and ran off. Of course, our server did not come back and we ended up forgoing the straws. The menu is a healthy eaters worst nightmare (I did not pick this place, someone in our organization did). I ended up ordering a portobello sandwich (without the bread) hoping that it would be palatable. I assumed wrong. The portobello was greasy and oily. It tasted almost like someone tried to fry it. My coworker ordered the chicken and waffles with sugar free syrup. The dish she got had the syrup on it, and it was not sugar free. She's diabetic so she could not eat the dish. When she finally got ahold of our very inattentive server to ask her for a new plate with sugar free syrup the server snapped back at her \"it's already being fixed!\" grabbed her plate and walked away briskly. She was hands down the rudest server I have ever encountered, she should not be working front of house anywhere. She clearly is not a people person. At any rate, shortly after leaving I developed a stomachache from the greasy mushroom cap and vowed that I would never return to a Hash House A Go Go establishment. I can't think of anything positive to say about my experience here.",

    "text": "I really appreciate the cleanliness of the restaurant. The staff is very professional and so kind! This review comes from a couple with very high standards. I pride myself on my cooking. However, sometimes this tired wife and mommy wants someone to cook for her. My husband has tried this place before and he enjoyed it, so naturally I was really excited to try it out. We went for breakfast. The food is good. Our two kids split a kid plate and that was plenty. The single pancake they received was HUGE. pretty tasty too, but it was a little rubbery. My husband had the chicken and waffles and I had the chicken Benedict. Both were good. The sauce on the Benedict was just the right amount of spicy, but too savory for me. When I take a bite of something I like to taste every single component on my plate in that bite. I had to search for items on my plate without sauce to taste them. The sauce is very over powering so you don't really get to appreciate the flavor of the chicken, biscuits, or anything else. I didn't even know it had egg. Benedict- duh, but I completely forgot to look for it until my husband asked about the eggs. They looked scrambled. I guess that's how the dish is prepared? I really do love poached eggs though. No big deal, as I said before, I forgot all about the eggs. My only complaint is that the chicken was dry. Oh, but the coffee was nice and strong! Yay!  I want to come back to try a Bloody Mary (I saw one at another table and it looked soooooooo good), not sure what I would eat... But don't get me wrong the flavors are good! I just left underwhelmed. It was very close to perfect here, but I don't like dry chicken. So far Metro Diner has been the best place for breakfast. Vegas has many breakfast options, so I will keep searching. I have to be able to find more than one perfect breakfast spot in this busy city.",

My boyfriend, his sister and I came for a late lunch around 1 pm on Memorial Day and there was a 30 min wait. The last time I tried to come here it was an hour wait so I decided to stick it out  and deal.   Once seated our waitress didn't come by for about 15 mins to take our drink order. Really during the whole meal she was super inattentive and had her runners doing most of the work. She wasn't very friendly or inviting either.  I thought maybe the food would make up for the shotty service but nope. I had the smoked salmon hash which was just alright. I felt like it needed some type of sauce or more spice to it since it seemed super bland to me. The only good thing was the pineapple mimosa which was almost more champagne then pineapple but that's always aright.  Overall I was just very disappointed by this place. Glad to cross it off my list, but I definitely will not be back.",

Too bad we couldn't get here before everyone slept off the alcohol and partying from the night before...maybe if there was no remnants of leprechaun piss in my own bloodstream...  Long wait, but the food is worth it. I don't usually order pancakes when I'm out, but blueberry and white chocolate is a seductive combo. My dining companion had the sage fried chicken benedict with a nice chipotle kick to it. Portion sizes are ridiculously huge...the Benedict could have served 3 or 4 people and the pancake extended over two opposite edges of the giant plate. Plan to share or doggie bag! Good food, expertly seasoned, and prices are a value taking into account the amount of food served. Kiwi watermelon lemonade was tangy, refreshing and pretty to look at with the three layers before I swirled them all together. Casual farm ambience with enough stainless steel worked in to not feel cheesy and decent service considering how packed it was. I was elated to learn they have a location back home I can check out after I leave fabulous Las Vegas ^.^",

Everyone in our group loved their food, and there were certainly left overs when we were done!  The ingredients used in the food are such good quality, that you can really taste the freshness. The prices aren't too bad (most plates under $15), which is a great perk! Most trendy/high quality meals are much more expensive.  There is another restaurant location on the strip, but that wait is even worse than this one. It would be worth the drive into the surburbs of Vegas for a visit here!",

When I first received it, I didn't know whether to dig a fork in or adopt it and name it something clever, like, Eggy. This dish was ginormous is what I'm trying to say and extremely palatable. I came up with that word by googling 'tasty.'  Forreal though, if you are fortunate enough to find yourself the wonderful land of Las Vegas stop here for a brunch in (or out (believe you me there was leftovers)). Yelpper!",

The wait to get in was fair considering the popularity of the restaurant. For 2, we waited about 12-15 minutes.  The environment was enjoyable; the music was in good taste (indie/alternative rock), the customer service was enthusiastic, and the walls were filled with celebrity-signed menus.  The food was amazing! The portions were behemoth and one plate is more than enough for two people. The alcoholic drinks are served in quirky slanted cups and they can be taken home as a souvenir.   Overall this was an awesome first experience!",

If you're not much of an eater, you'll want to share with a friend. I've come to this location during lunch and dinner and its typicaly packed during the meal rush hours. Wait times can be around 15-20 min sometimes, but you can always opt to sit in the bar area and not have to wait at all. Service is decent here even when it's completely packed and it's better than some of their other locations",

I really could use that 1/2 star right about now!   Everyone seems to love to come here. My first encounter with HHAGG was in San Diego, about 5 or 6 years ago. I was impressed by the portions, decor and service, but not the flavors. I hate to say it, but that trend has continued since going to the one here in Vegas as well.   I understand the appeal and I don't hate the fact that everyone I know likes to frequent this place for special occasions or lunch. There are definitely some appetizing things on the menu, I'm just not a devotee. Although I won't put up a fight if my friends want to go. Most of the food is just ok. I think the problem I have with most of their dishes is that there are just too many flavors going on. You can't taste the actual food. Also, a lot of their proteins (chicken, pork, beef) are overcooked and dry.  It's all concept and no execution as far as most of the dishes go. The food is just very regular, despite the enormous portions and spectacular presentation.   One thing I enjoy at HHAGG is the breakfasts. I enjoy the hashes and scrambles quite a bit, so if you're going to come, come for breakfast or brunch. There drinks are quite good and pretty as well.   At the very least, the food is very photogenic!",

I thought this place was supposed to be good. The building, chairs, and staff seemed a little run down. It was sad. The dinner menu is limited and doesn't have scrambles or omelets. I ordered the Meatloaf Pasta because it sounded interesting but I ended up getting the spaghetti and meatballs. I didn't know it was the wrong thing until my final bill confirmed it. It was spicy, had a bunch of sticks on top of it, and had no flavor. I don't know what my wife bought but it looked like a pile of random crap in a skillet.    My waitress put in less than the bare minimum effort. She seemed to be hiding the whole time and had some kinda hearing problem. She fluttered away as we brought up missing items and inaccuracies on the final bill without response. It's worse when you see the only other waiter in the room working his ass off and treating his customers well (you know, checking on everyone, getting their orders right, listening...that sort of thing). Chances are if he was my waiter I wouldn't have written this, I still would never go back there, but I wouldn't have written this review.....",

    "text": "My husband and I had gone to Hash House once in CT. I really liked it then so for Mother's Day we decided to give it another try now that we live in Las Vegas. I was not impressed in the slightest. Neither the hostess nor the server seem very interested in doing their jobs and no one was smiling. The server even decided to stop listening to me and would walk away while I was talking like mid-sentence. I ordered the Boston Hash, which is a dry over-salted crab mush atop a bed of burned potatoes. I had ordered it for the fruit side so that I could feed that to my son, but ended up with soggy carrots and green beans. Toddlers don't enjoy that as much. I'm cool if you run out of something and let me know but the server, in her continuing vow of silence, didn't say anything.   The general look of the place was run down. They seated us in the middle of the room on very wobbly chairs. For a place with fat people portions, they sure don't have fat people furniture. I was certain that I was going to break that chair like in the movie Shallow Hal. It would be fitting because that character's name is Rosemary and this restaurant likes to garnish everything a giant branch of rosemary.   As an aside our receipt said biscuit on it but there were no biscuits any where on our table. We weren't charged for it but it seemed to be the only thing that looked really good. I tried to ask about it but the server walked away before I could finish my question. I wish I was joking.",

    "text": "I kept hearing about this establishment as a great breakfast spot, and didn't want to go to a watered down version of it with locations located throughout various casinos on the strip. So, we opted for the one about 6 miles off the strip. Don't let the drive to it scare ya, as it's lined with a lot of vacant businesses. You will reach the location as it's across a CarMax and it's next to some Vampire themed club (no, I'm not joking).  We got here around 8:30am Saturday and the place was pretty vacant. We took the tip from others stating to get here before 10am. Loved the mellow ambiance of the place and the staff was super friendly and got seated with our menus asap.   Their menu was no joke and goes way beyond the standard breakfast options. Some things made myself and the hubby go ooo and ahhh, but since we didn't want to try anything too crazy as we were heading to Utah for an long day of being outdoors, we opted for something that would sustain us for a long day ahead. I opted for the original HH benedicts while the hubby got the Tractor Driver combo. We looked around the other tables with the huge portions, so we knew what to expect.  Here's the breakdown:  Original HH benedict- Crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin w/ market yellow tomato, spinach, bar b' que cream and topped w/ scrambled eggs, --oh, and this in top of a huge biscuit and mashed potatoes!!!! Holy moly, when they brought it out, it was like a diorama of the Red Rock canyon, with a sprig of rosemary as a miniature tree on top of the mountains! I swear, cutting into it was cutting through 5-6 layers of food! One bite and man oh man...so gooooooood!!!! The BBQ cream gave it a different flavor because I'm a hollandaise type of gal, but it worked for this dish! Seriously, 2 people could have split this entree, but I got through about 75% on my own (hey, needed the carbs for the hiking!). Definite try if you're an eggs benedict person like me.   As for the Tractor Driver combo, it was a borderline pothole sized pancake with eggs and bacon. The hubby can eat pancakes, but even he only ate about 1/2 of the pancake in order to eat the eggs and bacon as well. Goodness!   So yea...the portions here flat out represents why people think people in America are fatties. And if an episode of \"Man vs. Food\" had to prove how ginormous their portions are...yea, come here with an appetite.  I won't lie...I secretly would like to return to try to chicken and waffles breakfast I saw others eating at the place, but again, will have to share that monstrocity with someone because I may get a heart attack if I ate it myself.   Prices justify the portions and the taste. Yea, get here early! It's legit",

My first experience here was just ok. Today was awesome. The chicken was so flavorful and moist and my bacon waffles were incredible. The sage chicken benedict was just as good. The Chipotle sauce with the benedict was a great touch.  I have no complaints other than my pants feel tight.",

There was a few people who got there 20mins after us and were seated the same time as we were... that kind of annoyed me especially since our \"party\" was 2 adults and 1 child compared to others who were 4 or more. At the beginning I was asked if my son who is 5 wanted a high chair or booster I said no he could sit in a normal seat... he's not a baby and is old enough and tall enough to sit in a regular chair. Well low and behold when our thing rang the host tells us she though I wanted a high chair and if I didn't there would be more of a wait. WTF?! After waiting 50mins (which was only supposed to be 30) you want me to wait longer because the host doesn't listen?  We just went with the highchair which my son DOES NOT fit in... but do you think they offered a normal chair? NO. Ugh. So the server comes and takes our order and we see the bigger parties get seated 2mins after we were... now I'm like super irritated... but I'm still super nice and what not.  I understand there is a wait for food, but ONCE AGAIN the parties who ordered AFTER we did got their food first... ours came 10 mins later. Wait, my friends got here then 10mins after that I got mine. Seriously? Who wants to sit there and eat after everyone on your table get their food?  He ordered chicken and waffles and I ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich. His food looked good, and finally after my food came I was wayyyy too irritated to even try it. Instead I pulled out my phone and typed this long rant/review. The chicken and waffles were ok, nothing orgasmic and the sandwich was horrible and tasteless. I had to add hella salt and cut the piece of pork into 4's. Some people like the \"huge\" portions, but I dont. Why are you going to give me a huge oily breaded piece of pork and a standard sized bun? What am I supposed to eat the rest of the sandwich with? Ugh.  The waitress was wayy nicer to my guy friend than she was to me, even though I was the nice one. Beesh!   This place is nothing great, the food is over priced and oily and isn't worth the freakin wait. I wouldve rather spent the 40$ some place else.",

A friend told me about wanting to go to Hash House and only being here once which was in San Diego, I was not familiar with their menu. She told me about their Chicken and Waffles and suddenly a craving for it I just couldn't resist finally made me try out this place again.  I was not disappointed! Chicken was tender and the flavor was slighty better than Roscoes. The only thing better at roscoes is that they drown their waffles in butter, haha but not so better health wise. Now just thinking about it, I forgot to order mash potatoes and gravy on the side.  Roscoes is cheaper too, so even if I remembered, hash house might have charged me another $10 just for those sides.  The 4 fat waffles it comes with also has bacon it.  I was only able to finish 2 which was beyond filling.  I also tried their snickers pancake. Snickers in a pancake huh? Why didn't I think of that!? Damn that genius!  Felt so bad stacking up those calories.    This place is a must try, especially for breakfast.  And oh, don't come here without an appetite because they offer a fair amount of serving in their plates.",

(Sorry Mom!) The mashed potatoes are STUPID GOOD too. My son ordered a pancake (either blueberry or cranberry & walnut) that was as big as a Domino's medium-sized pizza. JUST WAY BETTER! The look on his face when it was brought to the table said it all.  YES IT'S CROWDED PEOPLE!!! When something is this GOOD, people tend to show up in large numbers and then they want to stick around to enjoy all that buttery goodness. THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS. SOME THINGS WILL NEVER CHANGE. When the food stops being good and the service turns for the worse, there won't be as many people in front of you. Then there won't be as many good reviews because bad service & good food rarely coexist anwyere in the world.  Thanks Bin Laden! :-P  I've never had any issues. Probably because I'm a fan of the food. If I know we're going there, I'm prepared to wait because it's well worth it. I've been to this location as well as the one inside the Golden Nugget downtown and the food and service were both excellent, although I enjoyed the vibe at this location better than at the Golden Nugget.  If you're not a fan of the SUPER-SIZED & DELICIOUS, this is NOT the place for YOU. I promise I won't complain if you're not there because it'll only mean that I'll get to my table faster if you ain't all up in the way!  MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THERE ISN'T A HASH HOUSE IN LOS ANGELES (MESSAGE!!!)",

We first heard of this place when a local roulette dealer told us good brunch places to eat that does not have long lines like the Wynn brunch.  We got seated immediately since we went to this location before it was on the TV show Man vs Food and the Imperial Palace location.  Fresh juice:  lemonade, watermelon, and OJ.  All juices were freshly made, without any additives.  The portions are large, so order 1 entree of each type of food you want to try and share!    Food:  Sage fried chicken benedict massive strips of chicken strips on top of eggs that had a chipotle cream sauce rather than the typical hollandaise sauce.  A side of yellow watermelon was served with this as well.  I guess fruit can be seasonal so who knows what you will get when.  Chicken and waffles:  3-4 pieces of waffles with additional 3-4 pieces of sage chicken strips, that is topped off with syrup, and fried scallions  Banana pancake:  the size of this pancake is as twice as big as your head.  Pretty fluffy, but nothing too different about this dish.  I would have preferred ordering something else that was more unique to the place.",

Super huge and we all shared it because apparently it was the homies appetizer. -The Trucker Something- It came with French Toast, eggs, and sausage. OMG the french toast was AMAZING!!! It had walnuts (or pecans) and bananas on top. The SAUSAGE was delicious and very flavorful!!  -Biscuit & Gravy: Best I have ever had... definitley had a twist of flavor but it was great! -Sage Chicken and Waffles- I did not have any but it was a masterpiece of food!! It looke delicious and smelled amazing -Eggs Benedict - GIGANTIC protions and the boys smashed their food!! -Corn Beef Hash - I didn't eat this but it looked great!!  -Snicker Pancake : If I ate peanuts I would have devoured the pancake because it looked so good!!!

I dunno if Snoop Dogs ever been here but I'm sure he'd agree that the chicken n waffles are BOMB DIGITY.  The portions are a bit ridiculous but it goes with their theme.  I ate half the meal and it still looked like it was untouched.  Service was good and quick, all the staff was very friendly.

My friend tried to call yesterday to make a reservation because our party was large and they told us they couldn't make reservations until 5pm.  Then when we got there the hostess told my party that we could not make a reservation for a party of ten because the entire party was not present.  But they were waiting for a party of ten to be seated and for all of them to show up... Then she had to make the hostess write her name done because she told her that the name couldn't be on the list till our whole part was there... again...  The hostess then told us that she could not and would not give us a time because we had to wait for the other party of ten to be done eating after they are seated (who knows how long that would have taken). We then decided to leave.",

But now, after eating hash house, I need to go on another walk cause I'm full as Hell! Only because they give you starch after starch and it gets kinda old fast. Enough about me,on to the orders.      So, I ordered the chorizo hash with fresh jalapeno and a big ass biscuit which comes with the second best thing in the building, the strawberry jam. very yummy, so refreshing. Now theoverall chorizo hash dish was ok it could have been a Lil more flavorful. My wife ordered the fried chicken Benedict with the best thing in  the whole building the Chipotle cream sauce. The chicken Benedict is ok but it would be better first if they put the veggies on a Lil heat so they were more flavorful against the other parts of the dish (mashed potato, biscuit, chicken, etc.  I liked the flavor of the chipotle cream sauce though. Daughter got the chicken fried steak, needs seasoning badly. The chicken and waffles were very fluffy, I like mine very crispy, so I wasn't a fan. The chicken isn't very well seasoned either so it needs all thw sauces and syrup and stuff to improve the taste.   I don't know if I would go back to this place? Probably if somebody suggest it but if not I'm cool.  The service was excellent.",

I've personally tried the other location in Henderson and it was not impressive . I'll always come back to the Sahara location.

Thank you Vegas foodies for rating this spot so high and posting so many foodgasm shots of their popular Fried Chicken & Waffles plate. You guys led us here. And surprisingly, this place was packed on a random weekday during the daytime. We sat at the bar since there was no wait for the seating there.   I ordered myself a monstrous hot chocolate to start. I seriously probably took about 3 sips of that thing. I felt so bad wasting all that warm, chocolatey goodness in that huge mug.  For grub I ordered one of their farm benedicts, hoping it wouldn't come out as huge as the the fried chicken and waffles plate. Boy was I wrong! My benedict came with smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, this roasted red pepper cream and topped w/ two basted eggs. What makes these benedicts so special is that they serve it on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes. Talk about CARB overload! Since I don't have a binge-eating disorder anymore, I barely made a dent even into this plate. Boo!  The bf ordered an actual plate that didn't come out monstrous. I believe it was just a simple breakfast plate with eggs, meat and some potatoes. If he ordered a flapjack (which are the size of a Thanksgiving turkey serving tray) he would have been screwed for sure.  Even if you plan to swing into this restaurant hungover, I suggest sharing a plate with 1 or even 2 other people! Portions are more than plentiful.",

We had to wait 20 minutes to get a seat but it was so busy, you'd be thinking more like an hour plus.  Our server was excellent and handled the busy morning well.  As stated in other reviews, the service was a little slow once we were seated but nothing a polite question to your server couldn't fix.     We ordered fabulous Bloody Mary's, chicken fried steak, an egg scramble, and the ultimate.....sage chicken and bacon stuffed waffles. Everything was truly outstanding and flavorful.  The portions were very large so all plates are enough to share.    Great family place, the day after a long night place, or fun place just to eat good food.  We are looking to go back soon to try the dinner menu.  4/5 for slower table service but not a reason to skip it.  Polite staff!",

But I was in Vegas and a friend had suggested we go there for brunch. It was a weekday and it was pretty crowded but we only had to wait ~15 minutes for a table for three. Hash house a go go is a really fun place to eat, the portions here are ridiculously huge.   I've had their slapjacks and smoked salmon benedict before but was feeling a little adventurous and wanted to try something new. Staying in the smoked salmon realm, we got the smokes salmon scramble (with no cheese) and it was really good. I love smoked salmon for brunch. I was sharing with my boyfriend and we decided to get another plate, so he picked the roasted chicken house hash. The chicken in the hash was kind of dry, which made it really difficult to finish. Our friend who was eating with us had the meatloaf hash, I had a few bite of that and wished we ordered that instead...   The drinks here were really good, we had the whole of the moon which is basically an espresso affogato and the kiwi watermelon lemonade. Definitely recommend getting!!",

If you can't accommodate a guests seating request while the restaurant is empty how can I be assured I'll get what I really want for breakfast.  Update:  Management has replied to this review by stating this is company policy and that they were undoubtedly preparing for a \"busier time.\"  I understand company policies and procedures but to tie your employees hands by not letting them make simple decisions (restaurant is not busy, this customer wants to sit here, he won't be more than 1/2 hour, what the heck let's make him happy) is a policy that will keep this potential customer from ever stepping one foot in the doors of this establishment.  Way too many choices to be limited by \"Corporate policies.\"  No thank you.",

Once we got the food 2 of the chicken fried steaks were burnt on the bottom way over cooked also the twisted burger was over Cooked. The waiter was able to get a new plate of the chicken fried steak but plate seemed a smaller portion and had to wait another 10 minutes for it. Ketchup on the table was completely empty had to borrow from another table. Once we complained about the food, we didn't see the waiter until it was time for the check which took forever to even see us about that about 10 minutes of just waiting after we were done eating. We paid cash and didn't get correct change back. Us and the couple we were eating with the food was $35.70 paid $40 only got $4 back and the couples food was $37.30 and paid $100 and only got $62 back she didn't give us our cents back? Overall it was an unpleasant experience and ripoff never coming here again especially being a local.",

We walk in and first thing I noticed was that it has a private parking lot and outdoor seating! We went inside and it was so cute and southern looking. We got sat immediately.   Our server Jessica has to be one of the best servers I've had. Ever. She was fast with getting to us, getting out drinks, and she knew the menu like the back of her hand! She knew prices and what drinks were really good. She helped recommend popular dishes and checked up on us through out the meal. She was just great. Fun and outgoing! We'll ask for her next time we go in! She's perfect if you've never been there before! Amazing customer service.   Now for the actual food/drinks. The kiwi watermelon lemonade is worth every penny! It comes in a beautiful three layer setting with a watermelon slice on top! Just mix it and it's so good. Not too sour and not too sweet. I got the chicken fried steak, of course. Typical! It's my favorite breakfast meal. It came with some string beans which aren't my favorite but they were cooked and seasoned perfectly! I actually enjoyed it! The mashed potatoes had bacon bits in it. How much better could it get? Oh yeah! The chicken fried steak! It was so big! At least 9 inches big. The breading was coming off every time I cut into it because of how crispy it was. That's a good thing. Just mix it with the gravy and you're good! The gravy was perfectly seasoned as well. I don't know about you, but the gravy can either make it or break it! The man got Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. It's a little spicy which is amazing! The sauce made the dish.The chicken was so crispy and juicy. It also came with the same mashed potatoes with bacon, scrambled eggs, cantelope, a slice of watermelon, and a biscuit. The biscuits here are huge! The portions here are so big, so don't let the prices scare you. You will have leftovers! Nothing a microwave can't fix though. $16.99 for my country fried steak was beyond reasonable for how good it was and how huge the dish was. At the end, our amazing server Jessica kindly brought out a slice of watermelon and cantelope since Chris wanted more!  All in all I'm so happy with my first visit. We both described it as the best breakfast we've both had. I found our new breakfast place! This place is so amazing. Amazing food, amazing portions, and amazing service!",

We drove to the restaurant and were immediately seated.  It is a fairly large, clean restaurant with stainless steel tables.  The service was excellent and our server was friendly and informative.  We decided on the Blueberry & Pecan flapjack ($7.95 for one 12\" fluffy, flapjack) and the eggs, bacon, biscuit, potatoes, & fruit combo ($8.95) to share.  The flapjack was excellent and one of the best pancakes I've ever had.  It was large, fluffy, light and tasty with all the blueberries.  The server brought me extra syrup when I requested it fairly quickly.  I did see several people order the Man vs Food - Fried chicken eggs benedict $15.95)!

To be honest, I was very overwhelmed by all the food, I really had to think about which tasty meal would service my fast-buds. I believe I ordered something along the lines of eggs Benedict with chicken, and oh my was it good!!! These people are not kidding when the day the portions are large. This is easily splittable! Just berthing about this fish was amazing. The first layer is delicious mashed potatoes followed by the eggs Benedict and some amazingly tender fried chicken. Plus, gravy and I think tomatoes? I don't even know what the heck was entirely in it but it was so good! I think it's very reasonably priced considering all you get. Wow.",

I could not finish my single flapjack filled with blueberries, it was so huge. I can't describe how crazy good this place is. Just check out all the pictures and get over there for one if the best meals you will ever have!",

By the way John the waiter is the best, he is so helpful and friendly, I recommend him as a waiter if he's available. So why four stars? They had no vegetarian options. Luckily I was able to order the crab eggs Benedict, just without the crab and with mushrooms instead. It would be great if they could expand there menu with some vegetarian options to choose from. By the way the eggs Benedict is not your typical kind, it's more of a country eggs Benedict. They lose the English muffin and replace it with a biscuit, and this is all on top of mashed potatoes. The sauce for the eggs Benedict is phenomenal. Oh and the portions are HUGE, they are shareable plates for sure. I had so much left overs. Overall it's pretty good, I would recommend trying it.",

Anyway, I've seen this place featured on those food shows, so I knew I wanted to try it out now that they're in Vegas.  It was around 7:30pm on a Thursday night when we got here.  Not very crowded at all, which was fine.  I knew I wanted to get the MVF featured Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  It didn't disappoint.  It is GINORMOUS!  It is also delicious.  I was afraid the fried chicken breast would be dry, but it is moist and flavorful.  The flavors work well with the rest of the giant mound of food on the plate.    Get this and you won't be disappointed.  You'll have leftovers too.",

When the plate showed up I was glad we decided to share as I wouldn't have eaten half. The chicken was juicy and tender and the breaking was crispy. The waffles were delicious with the pieces of bacon in them. I loved the presentation with the Rosemary skewer sticking out of the top and the big steak knife on the side.",

It was like she personally took offense to it and just gave him the sausages to make a point that she was offended. I could have gone to Denny's, eaten with a reasonable pace and be treated better.

I was confused by the plate that was brought to me because it didn't look the same. The waiter explained that there were 3 other Sage Chicken dishes and explained how each was different. Then he offered to bring me a side of gravy to try to resemble the one I normally get. I appreciated the gesture and accepted, but he failed to tell me it would cost $4.50 to add on the gravy. When we went to pay I was annoyed to see I had been charged for the gravy when the server didn't mention it was an additional charge at the time he offered it to me. I spoke to the manager on the way out to say that while our service good, I would have appreciated if the server had told me I would have to pay more for the gravy. The manager was very polite and after hearing the situation she took the gravy off our bill. This restaurant values customer satisfaction which rates high in my book.  And the candied bacon is heavenly. I was just afraid it was going to pull my crown off. Eat at your own risk, lol.",

This time j got the fried chicken Benedict which was recommended by our awesome waitress.   The meal was sooo delicious! The portion was massive and that is always expected but I sure do try to destroy as much of it as possible. The chipotle sauce is perfectly spicy and the chicken is so tender! The chicken is fried with a maple syrup glaze, wow so yummy! The only part I wasn't huge on is the cheese layer, it's too thick and oddly placed on the meal. I ended up removing it and setting it to the side. My friend however loved the cheese part.  The service here is always awesome and a lot faster than the one at the strip or in San Diego! It's location away from the strip makes it a great choice when you don't wanna wait a long time!",

Very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, made good recommendations and even up sold on some drinks and stuff!   I can appreciate that since I used to server.   I started with the Kiwi watermelon lemonade.  That thing was delicious!  A couple friends got the fresh squeezed tangarine juice.  Good but a little sour for my tastes.  I was happy with my choice.  I ended up going with the famous sage fried chicken benedict.    Delicious!!!  The chipotle cream sauce was AWESOME!  I ordered an extra side of it since I didn't care about my caloric intake that day.    The chicken was nice and moist, flavorful.  Bacon was thick, a little soggy (i like my bacon crispy) but it was under a mountain of food so not the piggies fault...  The spinach and tomato added a nice \"healthy\" touch... lol sorry I have to laugh when i say that...  Then I had the big chunk of watermelon that came on my drink as dessert.    Let's just say, That was my one meal the entire day and I didn't even think about food until passing out when I finally got home back to LA.",

I would still recommend going there just try not to sit on Jess L.'s section. She made it a big bummer",

Plus, I really wanted to order a dessert drink but they were all around $10!!!    Plus, I ordered fries when I went there and they never brought them out.

Everything I've ever had here has been good. I recommend the vanilla waffles for sure! The chicken and waffles are awesome and HUGE! Also, any hash skillet or scramble is good.... What can I say. Pretty much anything made from here is ridiculously yummy! I'm a breakfast person. I can eat breakfast anytime of day. ENJOY!",

This might be my own personal opinion, but I've talk to other locals in Vegas and a lot agree with this statement. Hash House has it's one flaw but everything else is right on.  Very HEALTHY portions, customer service is always right on.  Sometimes you gotta wait but it's never more than 5 to 10 minutes.  I always seem to pick a great time to come as I've only had to wait once and it was a 7 minute wait. Like I said... when you order you always have a hit or miss issue.  When you get something that hits... it is amazing.  I think I'm going to go tomorrow!",

Over all a lot of food for a very reasonable price. Definitely on our list of places to stop at when in Las Vegas.

Without fail, the wee one gets a ginormous chocolate chip pancake  (and manages to finish most of it).  The portions are huge and the food is good.  We've slowly been working our way through the menu, but anything with the sage fried chicken is really good.  The benedicts are good too, but on our last visit they were really busy and some of the food was near cold, which was a little disappointing but I'm not a huge fan of cold smashed taters.    The drinks are good too, bloody marys are great!  We've been here for dinner before too and the meatloaf is pretty darn good (the hubs is not a huge meatloaf fan but enjoyed this one).    They're usually pretty busy around brunch time on the weekends though, so go early if you can!",

When we were ready, we got a booth while we wanted a table, I take the blame for not being more clear but that was an extra 15 minute wait. We ended up being seated outside.  It's Vegas, its friggen hot. With that in mind, I don't know why you had to go back and forth with us with the Misters and Fan when we were the only group outside. When you told us the manager asked you to turn the misters off and we asked to talk to the manager, he never showed up and we ended up leaving the misters on.  There was a very tense and awkward moment with your establishment and us, but once the GIGANTIC (I love you for that) portions came out everyone was gleeful and happy. When my friend ordered a entree and a flapjack (he didn't believe me they were big) he was totally overwhelmed by the food and we had the flapjack served like pizza to the whole table.  Your food is DELICIOUS, I know that for sure. I could eat your fresh made Jelly all day (strawberry peach was what we had that day) on top of the thick moist biscuits we get with our meals.  Suffice to say, we all had take home food which we enjoyed thoroughly. I'll definitely come back to either of your locations, and realistically you're a 4/5 star in my mind, just the sour experience ruined it a bit but not enough for me to stop eating your food.  Also sorry for stealing all the jelly on the table...  -Ed",

If you're working your way through a hangover and you're hangovers aren't made tremendously worse by crowds of people, this is what you need. I'm a fan of their hashes and their burgers are gigantic. Every time I go, I always think I'm just going to share with someone, but I want to try too many things. Food is really rich and I even try to order things with tons of veggies to make it a little healthier, but avoid this place if you're dieting. My qualms with this place (besides the touristy feel now) is that the service is really hit or miss. This seems to be a brand-wide issue because service is the same here and at their location in the M Resort. Hostesses all have attitudes, servers sometimes are completely attentive and sometimes they will drop by the table twice, to take your order and to drop off your bill. There isn't much they can do about being busy, or having an influx of visitors at this location, but they can certainly hold their staff to a high standard.",

I never imagined that a Snicker's bar would taste delicious with maple syrup on it, but, it does! My other half had the obsecenely enormous I Don't Know What It Was plate that he saw Adam Richmond eat on Man V Food. It was piled to the ceiling with a conglomeration of sage chicken, biscuits and gravy, eggs, potatoes, bacon and god knows what else. I never saw anything like it. He loved it. Usually he can and does eat everything on his plate, but nothing doing this time. Even he could not take it down. He was bested by several other big, arm tatted dudes straight from the set of Pawn Stars who I witnessed level the thing in under 30 minutes. It was brunch and entertainment.

The pancake took up the entire place so the potatos and the eggs were placed on top of the pancake...which i thought was weird. The eggs were DIGUSTING...they had no flavor...not even salt or pepper...they were so gross that i place them on my napkin to be thrown away. I thought the potatos were going to be hash browns, but they weren't...they were huge chunks of potatos. I had to get rid of the potatos and eggs in order to FINALLY eat my pancakes...As i was eating my pancakes they started to taste like those nasty eggs and potatos. Since the eggs and potatos were sitting on top of my pancake...it was starting to taste like the nasty eggs and potatos...I couldn't even finish it...I normally eat anything and everything...but that was GROSS...  Another thing is that this restaurant DOES NOT do replacements. All of their entrees have meat in them...but i don't eat meat. I asked my the server if we could replace meat with mashed potatos or something and she said no...so pancakes were the only thing i could order. This place is very high in pricing...My pancakes with the nasty eggs were $14 but they're worth like $5...The service was terrible too. Our server was rude and she would talk over me and she assumed that i was paying for my friend which wasn't the case...so i ended up being charged $28 because she didn't ask if we were paying separate. I was quite upset about that.   Overall I would NOT go to this place...I really didnt not like it. I was quite dissappointed.",

The food taste great as well! Been here a cople of times bringing visiting family and friends and the service is always good. Alot of parking and easy to find, you cant miss the tall sign and old tractor out front. Sometimes theres a wait but thats always a good sign that the place does well. Downside is during the summer when you have to eat outside in the heat so stay hydrated!",

    "text": "I recently saw a cable show where a limousine company turned a Ferrari into a limo.  It had never been done before. Frankly, it was preposterous. One of the guys interviewed said their biggest challenge was finding a way to make the supercar a stretch limo while maintaining the driving characteristics of a Ferrari. And somehow, they did it.  Although a bit less of an engineering challenge, the folks at Hash House A-Go-Go construct entrees that ride this fine line between quality and mega size.  Featured on the Travel Channel's Man v. Food, Hash House specializes in their self-proclaimed \"twisted farm food,\" basically jumbo-sized offerings and off-beat interpretations of traditional American favorites.  While their \"twisted\" fare is available at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, they're probably best known for their breakfast.  We visited the day after Thanksgiving around 10:30a and had a predictably long wait (45-50 mins). Consistent with the rebel streak they're going for, walls at their Sahara Ave. location are adorned with diamond plate textured metal and large nuts and bolts. The industrial look suggests that guys into bikes and hot rods would feel right at home.  We ordered their signature Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and Tractor Driver Special with Mango Coconut Pancakes (and for the record, it was my petite wife who chose to order the benedict). There's no denying the benedict was a monstrosity: a layer of biscuits, mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked bacon, tomato, mozzarella, and spinach TOPPED with fried chicken and generous amounts of their chipotle cream (gravy). And because anything this big merits a tree-topper, they plant a long sprig of fresh sage right on top.  Good grief.  I have to say my initial impression was genuine awe with undertones of mild disgust. This was clearly a dream for anyone who derives regular enjoyment from KFC's \"famous bowls.\" Pushing past our bizarre feelings of hunger laced with nausea, Dorothy and I started picking at the gravy-laden structure. And to our surprise, there were some nice flavor combinations depending on where you chose to bury your fork. The fried chicken itself was done well--crispy with nice chunks of moist white meat. Combined with a bite of potato and gravy, the chicken evoked a holiday meal more than it did breakfast. The chipotle cream had a nice hint of smokiness, but as it cooled down, the self-hatred to taste ratio definitely increased.    Only lacking tomato sauce and the fact it wasn't tossed into the air at any point during its life cycle, my pancake was basically a medium to large-sized pizza. Once again, I was pleasantly surprised, particularly by the lack of any \"doughiness,\" or uncooked batter. The pancake itself wasn't the best I've had, but it was adequately fluffy and a solid effort, bolstered by generous chunks of fresh juicy mango and shredded coconut. Not bland, but not too sweet, some pieces of cake could be eaten without syrup. My eggs were soft scrambled just right, and the sausage links plump and tasty (I've found that a decent test of a cook's competency with eggs is to order them soft scrambled; not having them overcooked or gushing of yolk requires just a bit of care and timing). The Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade was a nice way to top things off--tasty and refreshing, but lacking any heavily-syruped sweetness.                 It goes without saying that visits to these kinds of restaurants require a pre-meal regimen of a week-long fast, meditation, and a check-up with your doctor.  I think a regular visit would risk a gross-out burn-out.  Although, glancing at the scrambles and other egg dishes of our fellow patrons, it seems that slightly more modest meals are possible.  I've noticed a number of folks complaining about the price, which is perplexing. While the benedict cost $15.95 and the pancacke combo $14.95 (both at the top of their breakfast price scale), I'd point out that you're actually getting about $15.95 and $14.95 worth of food when ordering these dishes.  Each dish could easily feed two hungry human beings.  Sure, maybe they could drop a buck or so off the price, but if you're ever in L.A., go somewhere other than Denny's for breakfast. Double-digit fru-fru breakfasts are everywhere here, some with decent quality, but typically with a quarter of Hash House's portion size.  We have ample experience being ripped off at breakfast places, and Hash House isn't one of them.      A lunch at Hash House is probably in store for our next visit to Vegas.  I'll probably try the \"Kokomo,\" the benign moniker for what looks to be another guilt-ridden meal in the form of a meatloaf sandwich. It's probably a good thing we don't get out to Vegas too often these days. Like the city itself, Hash House is a spectacle incompatible with daily living.",

I had the Eggs  Benedict,  it was ok, my hubby had the Pacers Hash which was 80%  potatoes, the pork was tough and with absolutely no taste, he kept salting it, I actually told our waiter how disappointed he was with the Pacers Hash, he apologized and quickly took it off the table but offered nothing in place of it- my husband only ate maybe 30% of his food. My daughter had the #5 burger, I was surprised when she said was she was not happy with her burger either, due to lack of tasted.  Normally she wants her left over for breakfast - well, she wanted no part of it this morning-that is what prompted me to write this review. We must have gone on an off night, would  like to give it another try, but with their prices, we won't be going back.",

I later realized that we had one of them in Las Vegas so I decided to go.   Ordered two appetizers, and two dishes for main course and got a few of their specialty drinks.  Wow, the food came out all together and let me tell you the PORTIONS ARE HUGE. Split dishes, don't bother doing it all by yourself or plan on taking home food with you.   You can feed small countries with the food on these plates. The dishes are unique to themselves, tastes are different. Don't expect the normal eggs Benedict  these are special versions and will be sure to keep you full!  I have been back four times. If your going in a group restaurants website has coupons to save some cash. This is a must go :)",

Their slogan \"Twisted Farm Food\" encapsulates the menu pretty well.  We went to HH for breakfast around 10:30 on Sunday morning and sat down immediately.  Lucky timing -- because when we left about an hour later the line was huge.  Much like the huge portions of food we were served.  My husband had one of the Sunday Specials -- a giant skillet with pork tenderloin, home fried potatoes, green beans, corn, sun dried tomatoes, mozzarella, 2 fried eggs and a huge biscuit.  I had a scramble that consisted of salmon, pesto and brie that was also served with home fries and huge biscuit.  We switched plates half way through and still brought home a (you guessed it) HUGE box of leftovers.  My husband liked the very strong coffee that was refilled often.  I liked the homemade blackberry jam atop the biscuits.  The food was good, but needed a bit more salt then we're used to adding.  The service was top notch, especially considering how busy the place was the entire time.  And the music was all 80s alternative which made my meal that much more enjoyable :)",

The potato's are nice and crispy and they don't skimp on the corn beef.  Also the biscuit is quite good with the homemade jam it becomes quite great.

Plates so big I can't understand how the waiters are able to bring 2 at a time, seriously it's like a platter. They brought dinner biscuits with a nice honey-ish glaze first. I ate about half a biscuit and like, 1/3 of my huge dinner. I went to eat more later at midnight, still only ate like 1/4 of it. Got a full to go container left!  Hubby was able to eat half of his, kiddo ate a kiddo sized portion, and half of that. She got kiwi watermelon lemonade which was really pretty and very good. See pics! SO I think this is our fourth time here-sign up for the mailing list and get a BOGO coupon...last I checked you could only get it by joining their Facebook and signing up,but it could have changed by now. If you have a BIG appetite, this is your place. Man vs. food came here, and I think he ate this huge variety of \"benedict\" which a neighboring table ordered. HUGE.  Of all the places I've eaten, I've never seen such big portions of food. I really wanted to try banana mocha-maybe next time. Happy eating!...stuffing your face :X",

But well worth the visit, the prices are not bad considering what you get. I did go another time and got a burger and it wasn't anything special. So I'd recommend getting what they are famous for, which is their benedicts and sage fried chicken and waffles.

It was crowded and the Host was great and got us in less then 5 min.

Our friend, who's a Las Vegas local was dying to bring us here before we left.. So we gave it a shot.  Out of four people we had the corned beef hash, the basic breakfast, and two different scrambles.. I had the basic breakfast with a side of gravy and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes and biscuits and gravy were exceptional. I was loving that gravy all over my biscuit, but sadly my eggs were undercooked and not satisfying. My friends corned beef hash seemed a bit too cheesy due to the overwhelming chunks that smothered his meat. My friends said their scrambles were good, but one said they didn't like how they didn't allow her to customize it to her liking.  The experience was overall decent. I think if I were to return that I would try their bacon waffle or get some pancakes. They looked soooo good. Wasn't the best place I've had for breakfast in Vegas, but not the worst either, just okay.",

I got a dish with mashed potatoes as the base, biscuit, eggs, and then covered in a red bell pepper cream sauce. Uh-May-Zing.   I also, in my greed, ordered a biscuit on the side and savored it, after slopping butter all over it. I miss that biscuit. I want that biscuit.  The coffee is good, and the waitress was friendly and helpful. Will totally go back next time I'm in vegas.",

I'm not sure why people are raving about a place that services such large portions of less than mediocre food.  My husband is a fan of fried chicken and waffles, but said these were the worst he's had.  The waffle was dense and rubbery, not crisp and fluffy.  I think I had some type of skillet scramble that came with a crab cake on top.  The crab cake was probably 4-5\" in diameter with no crab flavor or visible crab chunks.  It tasted of all bread crumb.  I would prefer a small crab cake with actual crab meat it in.  There was a salsa underneath the crab cake which made the country potatoes soggy.    Huge portions, horrible food and watered down drinks.  There are TONS of places to eat in vegas.  I would definitely skip this place.",

Half way in, it was clear that the burger would win the battle, as I began gasping for air and drinking water to clear my stomach for more. All futile attempts at this point.  Service was ok. Our waitress was awol for several minutes, it was difficult to get her attention as she appeared overwhelmed by the amount of customers in her care at that moment.   Prices are quite reasonable for the amount of food. Definitely an experience that every man/woman should try, at least once.",

    "text": "When you are in Vegas, you want to do things BIG.  Drink hard.  Play hard.  and of course, eat hard... but who really wants to eat hard 'everytime' that they need to spend $40+ on a Vegas buffet?  Fear not- the locals know the best, and thank goodness for my awesome Vegas friends for taking Jaymie Lynn S. and I out for some good eats, because Hash House A Go Go is definitely a spot to remember.  First of, this place was packed when we arrived during lunch hours on a Saturday.  Our wait was about half an hour, which is honestly not that bad if there is a delicious meal at the end of the rainbow.  So be prepared to wait a little.  In the meantime, I highly recommend looking over their menu because it is LONG and full of many options that are going to tease your every cravings.  From breakfast foods to a calamari steak, use your time wisely to choose.  Ambience?  This joint was blasting remixes of Top 40 hits- I LIKE!  It made me wish I had that iPhone application that helps identify tunes you may be unfamiliar with.  We were seated on the right side of the restaurant which made for more room, but less air conditioning because the fans weren't blowing our way.  Onto the menu!  I had a really hard time deciding what I actually wanted to eat here because there were so many.  I was looking favorably at the Chicken & Waffles options, when my friends recommended I try the \"Andy's Sage Fried Chicken\" because it had my name on it.  I figured- why not, and selected that for my lunch date.  I also ordered a lemonade, and was pleased to hear that drinks were bottomless here.  However, the lemonade proved to be a bit too sour, so maybe an iced tea would have been more appropriate.  After waiting for what seemed forever (around thirty minutes... quite a bit of a wait IMO), our food came out.  Mine came out last, but what I saw on my friends' plates was shocking.  PORTIONS DO NOT LIE.  THEY ARE HUGE.  My Fried Chicken meal came with mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon, medley of tomatoes and a side of fresh fruit.  It was big eats here.  The presentation of it was wonderful as well, and upon first glance, I knew I was going to have trouble finishing all of this food.  The chicken breast piece was juicy, and did not feel overwhelming being fried.  Everything on my plate was honestly very tasty... but to nobody's surprise, I could not finish this giant meal.  Check out the size of this plate: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?action_user_photos=1\">yelp.com/biz_photos/g8On...</a>  If you are a light eater, sharing one dish can be your life saver!  Jaymie Lynn S. let me have a taste of her calamari steak, and it was hella good!  It was an interesting take on the traditional calamari style meats, but I very much enjoyed it along with the condiments that came with it.  This was such a great eating experience, and I highly recommend it for any Vegas local or traveler wanting a great meal that is guaranteed to get you full.  Parking is available in a small lot outside of the restaurant, with more on the street once it gets packed.  With that... I've completed the Las Vegas episode of Man v Food!",

    "text": "OMG! omg, omg, omg. Did I say OMG?!    I have to tell you that I am NOT a fan a breakfast. I do eat it though and it's ok. I have never been wowed by breakfast. Let me just tell you that since visiting the Hash House, I have eaten those words. I have never been to a breakfast place where EVERYTHING (and I do mean everything) was delicious.  First let start off with the decor. This is a very nice place. Got a kinda old country/modern type feel. They have an outside patio in the front and also in the rear. The bathrooms are clean and quaint.   Enough of that, on to the grub. I ordered the pancake tractor breakfast with a rudy red mimosa. My hubby ordered the corned beef hask skillet with coffee. I have pictures of the food but the mimosa was so damn good, I finished it before remembering to take pics. (sorry)  My breakfast came with 2 eggs, potatoes and a pancake. Like I mentioned, I'm not a big breakfast eater, so I didn't want any meat. When my platter came (that's right, I said PLATTER), I couldn't do anything but buck my eyes. How big is this pancake, I asked the waitress. And I quote\" 18 inches\". When I tasted the food all I could say was ummm. They eggs tasted like they plucked them from up under a chicken they had out back. (don't know if they have a chicken house out back, but they were just that fresh!) The potatoes were awesome and the pancake tasted like buttermilk.  My hubby food came but before that he couldn't stop talking about the coffee. Now let me tell you, my husband drinks coffee, I don't. All he could talk about before his food came was how good the coffee was. I'm serious, he would not shut up about this coffee. He made me try the coffee. It was ok but like I said, I'm not a coffee drinker.  To quote my hubby, \"This is some damn good hash. The best I ever had\". My plate had so  much food on it 3 people could have ate with me. Even my husband had food left on his plate (and that's a surprise cause he usually don't leave anything!)   The bill came out to $40 but it was well worth it. You will not be sorry. I say go to Hash House on Sahara.",

    "text": "Seriously, this has to be one of the best places i have eaten in Vegas.  Im not one for straying off the strip, but honestly this place was amazing. Less than 5 minutes off the strip, I found Hash House A Go Go. Dipped in for lunch with a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate and the food was AMAZING.  I have been dreaming of their biscuits since I had them. Fresh made with a from scratch strawberry jam that is to die for!  The portions are ridiculously huge for such a small price, you really cant beat it. You get Farm Fresh Organic Food and don't have to blow a budget like most vegas eateries.  I got the chorizzo scramble and the jalapenos and tomato in it were so fresh. Eggs were cooked perfectly and it was served in a big black skillet with a biscuit and two pieces of very fresh fruit including a juicy slice of watermelon. My boyfriend ordered the basic, and although he would have liked a little more bacon he was very happy with his meal.  We ordered the blueberry pecan pancake to share and it was HUGE and sooooo good that I didn't want to stop eating it. The pancake was super large but not heavy...still light and fluffy.  I could go on for days about this place, but all you have to know is that its not that far off the strip, with a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate you will pay so little for the amount of food you get and the quality of food.  So come with an appetite and enjoy!",

    "text": "This is definitely a spot in Las Vegas to come to if you're looking for a famous restaurant that sells quality food that is presented well. I almost want to say that even if you don't have a car in Vegas, it's worth getting a taxi out here even though it might be like $30 to get here. Since I had a car on my last trip, I dropped by here. I'm pretty sure this place gets a lot more attention and fame since Man Vs. Food came here.  I ordered the \"Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit\" and the \"Kiwi Watermelon drink.\" The presentation was amazing and I would recommend getting it especially if you're into Chicken & Waffles. Personally, I am not into that combination but I wanted to try it anyway because of all the recommendations. I don't think anyone puts bacon in the waffle--interesting. I sort of wish I got something else after seeing other peoples' dishes but I still enjoyed what I got.  The service was amazing and the atmosphere was lively. I would come back for sure but maybe at a different location to see how different they all are. I think that this one is the main location. Since it's not on the strip, the street isn't that busy and parking isn't impossible.",

    "text": "This place is actually really good!  Went here once with my girlfriend awhile back.  We both mistakenly ordered two of the scrambles that were on the specials menu.  We were not impressed at all..  I'm glad we gave it a second chance..  We ordered two items and split them.    The first was the French Toast.  It was delicious!  There was nothing simple about this dish.  It is dipped in a banana cream batter.  And topped with fried bananas.  If you don't like bananas, avoid this.  They put the maple syrup on prior to serving, which is fine because it would just make the french toast soggy.  The banana batter helps to keep the french toast from being dry.    We also ordered the fried chicken benedict.  This was great as well.  It's a little messy, but every ingredient was good.  I did not see anything spectacular about the fried part of the chicken.  Not much seasoning in the batter.  But the chicken itself was moist and flavorful.  I would prefer other egg options than just scrambled in this dish.  Overall, the food we ordered was great!  And surprisingly, we ate most of these large portions.  The service was also good for us.    We will definitely go back to try other dishes!",

Omelettes, hash, fried chicken & waffles, burgers, benedicts, pancakes...  They also had good drinks... mimosas, watermelon- kiwi, fresh squeezed juices.     I had the \"hash special of the day\".  This was extremely good and had big chunks of pork.  The pork was tender, not dry at all.  The potatoes were also really good and it was mixed with a great assortment of other vegetables.  My friend had the fried chicken and waffles.  The fried chicken and waffles were piled high on his plate, enough to serve two! Someone else had flapjacks, which is their version of pancakes.  I couldn't believe the size of that thing! And it was extremely tasty too!  I wish there was a Hash House in the Bay Area!! This is a must-go!! You won't regret it!! .. And you'll come home with leftovers for your next meal too! ;)",

I left the Las Vegas strip in search for this place and it didn't disappoint.   Looking over the menu i couldn't decide what to get, eveything looked and sounded good. I ended up with the Sage Fried Chicken which included bacon waffles. As I waited for my meal, I saw other people's orders and was surprised at the huge portions and how the presentation was amazing. As my plate arrived, i knew i was in a little over my head. The two pieces of savory fried chicken and the 4 pieces of bacon waffles all looked tasty. As i started the meal, i knew i made the right choice.   The service was friendly and prompt also. I'll be back there when i visit LV again.  Note: I went during a weekday so there was no wait. Apparently, the wait on the weekends have been around an hour for seating. So plan ahead.",

(Tip: you can add a shot of liquor to make it an adult beverage.) As for the huge wait, well, we went at dinner time, and it was practically empty. Sometimes it pays off to have breakfast for dinner!

I'm a biiiig breakfast person and I pride myself on having a super picky appetite.  I am a flavor snob and Hash House flies with flying colors in my book.   The ingredients they choose for each dish comes together very nicely and the flavors meld into each other in the final dish they present at your table.  They use fresh ingredients and you can definitely taste it in their dishes.    The wait is at least 30 min, so be ready to feed them meters with your  quarters you collected this past week to do your laundry.  The consolation is that they have freshly brewed coffee for you to drink while you wait.    One dish can be shared amongst two people and they don't frown upon sharing dishes amongst a few people.  You'd be wise to keep that in mind when ordering for your group of two or more.",

We arrived at the right time (between 11:30a-12:00p on a Monday) because we were seated almost immediately. Shortly, a crowd of customers were gathering in the waiting area. We ordered our drinks then preceded to take a closer look at the menu.  I was COMPLETELY overwhelmed by the menu because EVERYTHING looked so good! There were four of us total and I didn't want to order the same thing as someone else, so that we could all have a taste of something different, I ordered the House smoked salmon benedict with fresh asparagus, sundried tomatoes, chili cream and two basted eggs. The rest of the table ordered: Andy's Sage Chicken with waffles, Corned Beef hash with red onions and swiss cheese, and Andy's sage fried chicken benedict with fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs.   I totally surprised myself in ordering the salmon benedict. I'm not much of a fish person and the idea of having it for breakfast sort of disturbs me. But I was glad that I ordered it, I really enjoyed the chili cream because it gave the dish a nice kick. We were kind of disappointed in Andy's fried chicken because it didn't have as much flavor as we had expected. It was  TOTALLY under seasoned! Another dish that surprised me was the corned beef hash. I was sort of expecting a pile of hash that looked like something that came out of the can, but it was actual strips of corned beef. They were nicely seasoned and quite tasty! I would have eaten more, but it wasn't the dish that I ordered.   The price for a single dish ranges from $11-15 bucks, which is SUPER reasonable for the amount of food you're served. A single order of food can easily feed two people.   I will definitely visit Hash House A Go Go on my next trip to Vegas because you just don't find that kind of breakfast food anywhere else!!",

After a dismal experience last July at their San Diego location with a breakfast I had, I held my review in hopes they would redeem themselves on a second visit. Didn't happen.   After a morning of driving from L.A. and doing some shopping, I was more than ready for some food. So we hit up the yelp and this place hit our radar.   For a Friday lunch they were kinda slow, but even so the hostess said there'd be a 10-15 minute wait? Odd seeing as we could see empty tables. We opted to do the manly thing and sit in the bar area. Service was great from the bartender.  Ordered was the Ham/Egg Burger $11.95, Spinach salad $8.95 (for some roughage) and the Mac & Cheez $2.95.   The best thing of the lunch was expelling it from my body the next morning. Sorry, but True. Okay, the fries were good. But this place is such a facade. Facade in that the dishes look appealing and are huge portions, but below the service sits mediocre food.   The Spinach Salad was over dressed with the raspberry vinegrette to the point that it was sickening sweet. The burger was just a mess. The ham added nothing to the taste and just added to create an even larger mess amongst all the ingredients. The mac-n-cheese was penne pasta with what seemed like a cheap cheese smothering everything.   So I'm guessing that a lot of the 4 and 5 star reviews are from hungover breakfast patrons who get blinded by the large portions and appealing plating and just are hungry to the point that they really aren't out for flavor and quality.",

    "text": "This was the location I first experienced Hash House after watching Man vs. Food.  Very happy I came. The food is basically on steroids. A plate can feed at least 2 adults. The food is super sized but it doesn't lose it's quality. Amazingly delicious!!!   This last time that I was there. I ordered the chorizo hash and griddled French toast with a refreshing kiwi watermelon lemonade.   What I've had: Andy's sage fried chicken benedict-I've had it several times and I could only eat 1/4 of the dish. It was certainly delicious. The chipotle cream made the dish even more special.  Fried chicken and waffles-it's a tower of chicken on top of a bed of waffles.  chicken pot pie-ginormous like all the other plates. It's a deconstructed pot pie.  corned beef hash (my bf's favorite!!)  caramelized banana pancakes-this is heaven!!! It's the size of a large pizza so be prepare to share with 3 other ppl.  Andy's famous bread pudding-very rich, chocolaty, fluffy and lovely!!!   Won't disappoint!!! You will never walk away hungry. To top it off, every person in your party will walk out with left-overs/an actual meal.",

The only thing I would say for someone trying it out is to stay away from the burgers.  They're HUGE and not that tasty.  My son loved the child's burger, but the adult burgers were a big disappointment.  (not nearly as good as IN n Out). Everything else I've had there has been AWESOME!!!",

We did not have to wait for seating although this place was full of people.  The portions are HUGE.  This is not an exaggeration.  The service we received was rather slow, but maybe because they are very busy, however, our waiter seemed to ignore us.  I had the French Toast, which I never order for breakfast anywhere, but the description, \"griddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup\", made me want to order it.  How could I resist anything dipped in banana cinnamon cream?  My taste buds had such high expectation, but sadly, they were let down.  Where was the creamy taste of banana cinnamon cream?  The french toast was fine, but truly nothing exceptional - in fact, it tasted just like the french toast I've made for myself at home, which is not saying much.  However, if you are in Vegas, I still suggest you visit, especially if big portions are calling your name.  Just order something other than the french toast, in fact, if I ever go back there, I think I would check the place out for lunch or dinner because I've discovered at other eateries that I've visited, that a place can have awesome food, but breakfast tends to be a weak link.  Or maybe I would return because it's just my wishfull thinking that a place with such a cool name surely has to deliver.",

It was packed with mushrooms and no visable other vegetables. She didn't enjoy it and didn't finish it. I had the double meat mashed potato burger with bacon. The bun was huge and looked great but was too hard to even bite into. I had to take the meat off the bun and use a fork. The meat and potatoes worked week and tasted good but all in all I was let down because when you want a burger u want the whole thing and not without the bun. It was over priced and over hyped.",

Since I consider myself more of a connoisseur of \"weird\" foods as well as ethnic cuisines, I am not often excited by American concept foods. I do like uniqueness and thus upon buying a gift certificate to this place wanted to give \"Twisted Farm Food\" a try....and I'm VERY glad I did!!!  First, I am a big atmosphere junkie and Hash House Delivered 5 stars in this category. I liked the contemporary, slightly country decor. I dined here around holiday time, so there was Xmas tree decorated and placed smack in the middle--which added more to the whimsical atmosphere and the modern touches to the place. I liked the huge, modern and slightly utility-like looking tables/chairs and silver metal touches. A++ for decor!  Our appetizers were also rather delicious. Polenta and sirloin dish was extremely appetizing and flavorful! I'm craving it right now! Salad, however, was a bit overpriced and was the only item that was not large in size. I felt that lettuce was a bit wilted and flavors were not as full as they should have been. Very average at best for the salad.  Of course we tried waffles and chicken for dinner!!! This dish was more fun then super delicious, however with the humongous portion sizes and many stalks of sage, I got to love this dish' homey flavors and how can you not like the \"baked in bacon\" in the huge waffle?   Aroma around the place was delicious! Think bacon mixed with sage. Yum. (I liked how all dishes had a similar sage decoration, it was very weird, but in a good, unique way).  Service was superb! Probably the best I've ever had. Not hovering over the table and interrupting, but being sweet and always quick with refills, recommendations and plate service.  I will definitely be back to this place! I do suggest sharing meals, and even with the extra plate fee (often waived), you will leave filled and even have left overs!",

I saw the Hash House a Go-Go featured on one of the Vegas morning shows during a recent business trip and decided we would check it out on our next trip to Vegas... boy we certainly weren't disappointed. This is probably one of my top three places to go for breakfast now.  They describe the menu as 'twisted farm food', which is a good way of describing it. Everything is made fresh and it is all good. You can get a traditional bacon & eggs if you like, but if you want to be more adventurous, you can try something like the Salmon & Brie Scramble with a side of grilled mashed potatoes (yes... MASHED POTATOES FOR BREAKFAST!!! How can you not love that?!)   The various hashes are a specialty. I particularly was taken with the french toast with pecans and grilled banana. YUM! Also, the don't pass up one of their biscuits with homemade jam (they come with most meals).   All the portions were HUGEMONGUS so make sure you're hungry and don't plan on eating for the rest of the day! We barely made a dent in our breakfasts when we went there. This would be a good place to go as a group and get a bunch of different things and eat it all family style.   The service was friendly and attentive which made the experience all the more enjoyable.   This place is quite a bit off the strip on W. SAHARA, so a cab ride would probably cost a bit. Its best if you have your own transportation. I do believe the Deuce Bus goes out there also.   If you're looking for a great place where the locals go, check this place out.We enjoyed it so much we decided to go back one more time before we left town and I'm sure we'll be back again.  If you leave here hungry, you just ain't tryin'.",

Our server took our drink order then brought our drinks, so far so good. He preceeded to walk by us and go to his tables next to us for 15min. Flagged down another server so we could at least pay for our OJ and leave so we could go some place that wanted or business. We've really been wanting to try this place. The menu looked good too. It's not like the guy was busy he was just a jerk who was too cool to be there I guess. What a waste of time that was!",

    "text": "Here's something I've never understood... what's the point of HUGE portions.. if the FOOD TASTES BAD?? Before I went to this place I kept hearing the same thing over and over again. The portions are HUGE! Well, yes, they are. And if that is all you care about you will have a great time at the Hash House A Go Go, but if you're someone who actually likes to eat a meal that tastes good, I'd -a- GO- GO somewhere else. The place does look nice, and the staff are helpful. They made quite a bit of the fact that Man Vs. Food was there filming during their run across Vegas. They serve very unique dishes, which is something I usually respect, but I think about restaurants, and cooking in general, the way i think about comedy. Some people say they don't like comedians who curse, other say they do, I say, as long as you're funny.. it doesn't matter. Same thing with food. You can be unique with your recipes, you can be traditional... so LONG AS THE FOOD TASTES GOOD! I had the corned beef hash with eggs. The eggs were bland, under cooked, and horrible. The corned beef was shredded in long thick strips and seasoned with something that smelled like foot powder. The potatoes were the worst part of the breakfast. Hard, unseasoned, and cold. It looked, and tasted, like they boiled a potato in water, hit it with a hammer, and put it on your plate. Not to judge harshly because of one dish, I went back a 2nd time as I always do before deciding on a place. This time I had the strawberry pancakes. Same story. They were the size of Texas, but they just weren't very good. Boiled cardboard. Sorry folks, this one is a NO GO!   Regards,  CFC",

Chicken Benedict would be the ONLY reason I would ever go back, BUT it's not to hard to mimic an at home version, just use Tabasco Chipotle with a white cream sauce. Brilliant huh? That's all they use, or so the server proceeded to tell us.  I was NOT impressed and have found out they are opening another location inside Union Plaza....hmmm Imperial Palace, Union Plaza, Sounds like they are stepping down not up? What happened they opened in the M resort and that restaurant has tanked? I guess you get what you pay for....crap. I won't go back, and I wouldn't refer it to a frenemy either.",

We waited 15 minutes to get our drinks. -The waitress was a bitch.  There, I said it.  With the breakfast, you get an option of grilled or fried potatoes.  She didn't ask my friend or I which we wanted, and when we requested the grilled, she seemed VERY annoyed.  She actually said, \"Um, this customer has decided now that she wants grilled potatoes, so could you bring those out?\".  I didn't decide then... I was not given the option like I was supposed to have been given. -The food came out at all different times.  My boyfriend didn't get his meal until a good five minutes after everyone else's slowly came trickling out. -The servings were massive.  I like a big serving now and then, but these were a blatant waste of food.  It was almost offensive. -The food wasn't that great.  I got one of the scrambles and it was serviceable.  Was it worth an hour wait?  Absolutely not.  Also, the iced coffee tasted like shit.  Long story short, I will not be coming back here.  I was shocked that it was so well renowned.",

    "text": "If you like your food good and big, then this is the place to go!  A friend took me to the Hash House a Go Go in Vegas on a trip a couple years ago and I have been adicted ever since. The portions are huge and are served on plates so large the waiters and waitresses can only carry one at a time. The cooks actually put a lot of effort in the presentation as well and when you get this huge plate of food sat in front or you it actually looks like the food you would get in a gourmet restaurant, only bigger, MUCH BIGGER.  Then you taste the food and it is just as good as it looks! I have recommended HHAGG to 3 different friends when they were visiting Vegas, and all of them came back full and raving about how much they loved it.  The only negative to this place is everytime I have gone we have had to wait a long time for a table. That one inconvenience aside, this is my favorite place to eat in Vegas. It's is pretty far off the strip, so if you are visiting Vegas and don't have a car, just know that a cab ride will cost you a quite a bit. I can't say how much cause I always have a car in Vegas, but considering the distance, it will be a lot.  If you have your own transportation you owe it to yourself to go here. Just make sure you are hungry!",

Then, when we finally got seated and our orders taken, we had to wait forever for the food, too. Then we finally get our food, which is all very presentable, but not at all very tasty. The quality of the food was somewhere around Denny's, but a lot more expensive. And even though it was a lot of food, it wasn't enough that I could disregard the low quality of it. Fail.

They make one helluva strong Bloody Mary too!   The one thing of note for me was the fact that the ingredients were SUPER fresh, and rivaled anything fresh I could get here in California.

I had high hopes for this place, but it just feel flat. The hostesses were rude and impatient. Service has always been impeccable.  The few things I like are their drink options. Their mimosas are out of this world, the s'mores mocha is genius (how has no major coffee house thought of this concoction?), and in the Summer time a watermelon lemonade hits the spot.  I often wish they had a little walk-up window (ala Serendipity 3) and I could just order a beverage and get food elsewhere.

Also my brother had a small complaint about his cocktail not being strong enough and she immediately grabbed it and had the bar tender make it a little bit stronger with no questions asked! it was great how easily she took care of it. Thanks Merisa!  So on to the food, I got a hash with mushrooms, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, and artichokes. To be honest it was a bit bland until I poured the yolk from my eggs on it. Then it was perfect! the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit. My brother got French toast which came with caramelized bananas on top. He absolutely loved them!

Oh, and a couple pieces of fruit, so you could eat healthy. When the waiter saw the look on my face, he said \"Isn't it great?\" Uh, no. No, actually. And, no.  My mom's brunch was a little less jumbo: meatloaf hash, fried eggs, and a biscuit, served in a full-size cast-iron skillet. It could have fed us both, amply, with leftovers. It was huge, but not disgustingly so.  Great concept, heartland food in a hip setting. But a truly nauseating execution.",

What really displeased me was the lack of service.  The waiter seemed to think that because we weren't ordering any alcohol, that he had better tables to wait on (as in the table next to us, who he was plenty attentive to, as they ordered about 12 drinks between the four of them).  I always tip 20% if it's just a good experience, so never judge a book  by it's cover.  So it took 90 minutes to eat there and never got a refill.  If you're looking for a good breakfast, save your money and go to Dennys... you'll get better service at least.",

The look and interior was a little dated.  The service was friendly and helpful.  I ordered the The Tractor Driver Combo with Two Eggs w/ bacon with 1 HH signature flapjack (it was HUGE).  The eggs came out perfectly scrambled (fluffy), the bacon was thick and perfectly cooked, and the huge flapjack was a little big and ok...not the best I have had.

    "text": "Hash House is a great restaurant to go to for massive portions and delicious food! We had a group of 6 and couldn't finish all of our food for dinner. It was a shame to see the food wasted. We could have ordered 2 dishes and finished everything.  We started off with humongous biscuits. They were the size of my fist! The biscuit was pretty good; it wasn't dry. The honey and butter gave it some better flavor. We also asked if there were any fruit jams available from breakfast. There was strawberry jam in the fridge and it was very fresh tasting. Yum!  Everyone practically ordered from the breakfast menu. Who wouldn't want breakfast for dinner? We had the following dishes:  + Pacers Hash ($12.95) - The potatoes were crispy and the pork as moist. Fresh corn, green beans, asparagus, scrambled eggs, and fruit also came with the dish. One small gripe was the cheese that covered the dish was a bit too heavy for me. Otherwise, great flavors!  + Boston Hash ($14.95) - The crab cake was pretty good, and the horseradish cream was not overpowering. The tomatoes in the hash made the potatoes a little soggy though. Dish came with asparagus, fruit, and scrambled eggs.   + Hammered Pork Tenderloin Benedict ($14.95) - Wow! This dish was awesome! The pork was so moist. I couldn't believe the size of the pork. The creamy sauce was yummy too. Also comes with a biscuit at the bottom.  + Grilled Portabello Mushroom Sandwich ($12.95) - I didn't get to try the sandwich, but I heard that it wasn't bad.   Split charge is $2.50 per person.   I would definitely come back again and try breakfast during the morning/lunch time. The food is very fresh since the restaurant doesn't own any freezers.   You can also visit the Hash House in San Diego. Our waiter told us that there would be another Hash House on the strip in the near future. Yay!  Separate men and women bathrooms are in the back of the restaurant.",

When I bit into the meal I was a little disappointed because it wasn't what I expected it to be.  The bacon waffles was something different, I liked that part.  The chicken on the other hand I wasn't too much of a fan, the breading was a little off to me and the sauce that was on the plate did not go well with the meal, it tasted like soy sauce.  I'd rate it a 3 but I gave it a 4 because you definitely get what you pay for! Roscoe's chicken and waffles in long beach, ca still holds the reigning champ title for chicken and waffles for me.  Girlfriend had the tracker combo with the banana french toast, and she loved it kept raving on about it so I'm sure that was a must :P",

They then brought it out and it was reallly dry. Again, seemed like it could have been better if it had been quicker.

    "text": "This is my second time coming to Hash House a GoGo for brunch, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint.    First off, the pricing:  While none of the food items would be considered cheap, the pricing is slightly less than what you would pay on the strip.    Second of all, portions:  Portions here are meant to probably meant to be served towards farm hands who have just had a full days work of lifting  100's of lbs of hay with no break for meals.  They are gigantic.  Trust me, you will most likely not finish your meal here.  Quality:  Everything we've had here is top notch.  I'm hesitant to say that about any restaurant, however the food is excellent.  The drinks are creative and tasty.  It's hard to go wrong with this place.  That being said, here's what I've tasted thus far:  Mango Coconut Pancake:  This is bigger than your head.  Heck, it's bigger than the plate.  I think it was about the size of my wrist to my elbow... and with soft sweet mangos (must be quality canned mangos, since consistency and flavor were perfect) and shredded coconut throughout.  The thing about their pancakes is, it's made so well that you're pretty much eating cake for breakfast.  Soft, moist, and tender pancake.    Roasted Chicken Hash:  Not sure how they made these potatoes, but they are perfectly crisp and flavorful.  The chicken is roasted well, with a few dry pieces (roasting a whole bird perfectly tender all the way through is near impossible, mind you), but a good dish overall.  This may be the one dish that doesn't stand out from the rest.  I was surprised, however, to see my wife downing the scrambled eggs since she hates eggs... and she loved the way these scrambled eggs were prepared.  Crispy Pork Tenderloin Farm Benedict:  Here's the winner for me.  A gigantic piece of breaded and fried pork, on top of biscuits, mashed potatoes, with a benedict sauce over the top.  Spinach, scrambled eggs... I was happy to just finish 2/3 of this... and the last 1/3 could have been put between two pieces of bread for a significant size portion lunch.  Get this.  If you like fried pork tenderloin, you will LOVE this.  Smores Espresso:  Gigantic cup of coffee, drizzled chocolate all over, torched marshmallows covering the whole top, and a few graham crackers on the side for scooping purposes and eating.  Pricey drink, but beautiful and executed phenomenally.  Smores fan?  You'll be in love.  Hash House Bloody Mary:  I don't like bloody mary's.  But I order this one every time I'm here.  Great condiments, excellent flavor, just enough kick to help jumpstart the day.  (I'm a lightweight drinker, mind you).  Definitely spicy and flavorful, so it's not for those with bland tastes.  Verdict:  While off the strip, very worthwhile to make the trip.  Great quailty, good pricing, huge portions, and friendly service... I've added this to my list of places to go to whenever I visit Vegas.  Followed by a nice 3 hour recovery nap to be scheduled every time.  Protips - From the yelp reviews along with other friends who have been there, go for either breakfast or brunch... that's where they shine.  It sounds like dinner is good here, but not as good as the breakfast items.  Also, while splitting is a great option since portions are huge, unfortunately you'll have to purchase side dishes so that they don't charge the fee for splitting entrees...",

    "text": "Came here as the last great meal to be had in Vegas. Also because my sister saw it on Man Vs. Food.  Came around 1PM, had to wait for 20-30 minutes to be seated. Once we were seated, took about thirty to forty minutes to order our food and have it served; needless to say I was starving by the time the food actually arrived at our table. Shared the HH Meatloaf Hash with my sister while our friend got the famous Chicken & Waffles. They make every single dish completely aesthetically pleasing, but as for the taste, it was lacking.  The meatloaf chunks were a tad spongey, I was disappointed that it didn't have a thicker, tastier gravy. The potatoes were a bit dry but the cheese & spinach they used was really tasty. I only tried a bit of the chicken & waffles. The chicken was good, but again, a bit dry. Same sad story with the waffles. Also found it odd that you had to ask for butter and syrup for the waffles.  I want to try this place again because I believe it could be/is amazing, maybe I just need to order something different. I definitely wanna try their pancakes next time.  Overall, this place is a bit on the expensive side (our friend ordered a large OJ & it was $6) but it's good for splitting something with a friend. Your best bet would probably be to go for a sweeter dish rather than a savory one.  Tips: - If you're splitting a dish with someone, order a side & they won't charge you the extra $2.50 split fee. - They give you a free daily house drink if you tweet \"I'm eating breakfast/lunch/dinner at Hash House\"",

It confirms that my experience was probably on the whole similar to everyone else's, and shows that despite how much I am constantly given anecdotal evidence to the contrary the world has people who are not morons devoid of sophistication and good taste.  I have been to HH for breakfast and dinner, and let me just say save your time and money and only come here for breakfast. Dinner is the exact same things with none of the breakfast meals and an extra two buck minimum sell-up on your items.  Aside from that I must say HH is great. It's not super amazing food. But for how much of it you get and how much you pay for how much you get it's a great value. The best values by far are the hamburgers which are huge and only $8!  But the big thing to get is the Chicken and Waffles. EXCELLENT! Also they make their own jam fresh! But ask if they have the strawberry it's delicious!  So here we are with 4 stars. I'll come here over and over, and yes the food is ok, but not great, but the service is good, and the prices are right, and it's a fun and trendy place. So do your best to avoid weekends it's a night-mare!",

The waffles were very dense and thick and they had strips of bacon baked INSIDE. Wow!! That's a genius idea!! The chicken was so crispy and tender; just perfect. They drizzled syrup over the entire plate which I thought was weird at first since I never thought that syrup and fried chicken would go together, but the pairing of the sweetness of the syprup and the salty chicken was just HEAVEN!

The waiter then said I had to order at least $1.95 (for a biscuit) for the kids or they'll be charged a sharing fee.  Seriously?!  It was only after I made a formal complaint to the manager that they took off this charge.  The manager, Lupe, was a nice lady but give me a break.

I would've given this place 1 star but my meal companions enjoyed their food.  Too bad.  We could've been repeat customers but after this experience and their stupid sharing policy, no way will I ever go back.  There are way too many other choices.",

The portions are HUGE so sharing would be a good option.   We ordered the fried chicken & waffle (the best), the eggs Benedict that had bacon and biscuits and a million other things on it (too much, too heavy), and banana cinnamon french toast (yummy but also a huge portion). Our waitress was super friendly and helpful in making our decision and the food came out really quickly.  I'd recommend this place over a buffet. Can't go wrong with a place that has tons of celebrity pictures on their wall, and they were even on Man vs. Food!",

    "text": "After a long night of taking part in the night life of las vegas, my roommate and i were about as hungry as two young men could be. That morning i could have ate a horse and then still had room for dessert. My roommate said \"it's a bit of a drive from north las vegas, but lets go to Hash House a Go Go\". i told him most breakfast places are the same but i'll try it out. after a 30 minute drive down to Sahara i saw the crowd at 1pm on a saturday....packed to the gills with college students, business people enjoying their day off, and everyone in between trying to recover from the night before. The wait for a larger party would have taken 30-45 minutes but my party was for two so our wait was about 5-10 minutes.   Our waitress came promptly and we were checked on just frequently enough to get any refills or to-go boxes (trust me, you'll need them).   Looking at the prices on the menu, it looks like a trendy breakfast/brunch was about to cost me a pretty penny (12-17 dollars was the range for a meal.)  so i placed my order and started a conversation with my friend. not more than a minute or two later i had to stop and gaze in amazement at the portions coming out of this kitchen! burgers the size of whole melons, stacks of waffles 8 inches high, just an incredible bang for your buck. and if the food tasted anything like it looked i was in for a real experience. the food took a good amount of time to get there. but with how busy it was i really wasn't about to complain as they are only human.    I can safely say that my chorizo hash with biscuit was THE BEST BREAKFAST i've ever had in my life. i've been all over the world and this blows any breakfast out of the water. i finished just over half my portion before i had to tap out. and the quality of everything was amazing. the rolls are massive and to die for.",

    "text": "I came for the sage fried chicken eggs Benedict and the hashes. I was hoping they would have a different type of hash but alas they just serve food. But that's all good because the food I had was delicious. The highlight was definitely the fried chicken eggs Benedict. You have to like chipotle because the entire giant plate is covered with a chipotle cream sauce, luckily I thought it was perfectly spicy and very tasty. Like some ofthe other reviewers have said, the chicken is a bit dry but my piece was not bad at all and nothing that compromised the dish. The grilled mozzarella on the chicken was a perfect addition to the chicken flavor profile. The dish is perfect to split with someone.   The best part for our group was that they have seasonal fresh made jams for the biscuits. Peach was the flavor of the day and it was fantastic. My friend doesn't like jams or jellies but likes peaches so he wanted to give it a try. He loved it and wanted to buy a jar but they didn't sell any. Our waitor saw that my friend was bummed about not getting to bring any jam home, so when he came out with check he brought a huge container half full of the jam. He gave us as much as was on the table for use. Great service. Thank you very much sir it outlasted our trip of 3 days.",

I could not finish a whole order of Biscuits and Gravy...  possibly made a mistake ordering french fries on top of potatoes that came with my oder - but our server said we did a \"great\" job and came closer than most to finishing our dishes.  My friend had a burger with hardwood smoked bacon, avocado and cheddar cheese.. the burger was huge and yummy looking...I snuck a bite....  Nobody left the Hash House hungry...in fact, just as some of the reviews have said, we needed a nap after.... the food was a fun take on breakfast classics and the service was down home friendly...and the atmosphere was pleasant and the decor was Midwest modern and relaxing for the middle of the desert.",

Really? One person who wants a heart attack! It was ginormous. I knew we had made a mistake the moment I got up to go to the restroom and started eyeballing everyone's plates.   Sage fried chicken and waffles - They do their chicken right here! While I'm not a big fan of sage, I do appreciate a good piece of fried chicken that is moist, fried well and not oily. The chicken here was delicious. The waffles had a piece of bacon baked right into it. It tasted ok though, too soggy. I like my waffles crispy.  Chorizo hash - This was yummy, but there was more potato (freaking huge pieces) then chorizo. I wanted to taste more meat. Had a nice spicy kick to it. Wanted to really eat the more of the biscuit on the side, but held off because it was way too much carbs. But overall, a good solid dish.   Snickers pancakes - It was good and of course huge, but I probably wouldn't get it again. Nothing unique about have pieces of snickers embedded into pancake. I really want to try a fruity pancake next time.   I also got to try a watermelon/apple slush drink (good...tasted like a jolly rancher) and a  bloody mary (strong!). Hash house definitely leaves your taste buds with an impression. =P  Came right around 9am on a Sunday morning and got seated right away. When we left an hour later, the waiting area was packed. Get here early or be prepared to wait.   I want to come back and try more!",

It was crowded but the wait wasn't long. It gave us enough time to look at the menu and see what we wanted to devour.   I went with the signature chicken and Waffles and my boo the steak eggs Benedict. The presentation of the food is a work of art. The flavors were bursting in my mouth. The just of right crispness of the waffle and juicy bonesses chicken breast with rosemary seasoning. Ugh I want one now please!  The steak and eggs Benedict was also yummy.

It went like this: I walked in with my boyfriend to escape the god-awful summer heat and I wandered into this gem with pictures hung up of all the celebrities who have visited. I'm interested. We sat down, and our server gave us a plethora of menus. It didn't bother me. I like variety. I quickly scanned for any sign of beverages, because you know how some places take your drink order before your bottom hits the seat? They actually gave us time to decide. I noticed the S'mores mocha and I had to try it. It was so gooey and messy looking, it looked outrageous. I fell in love. It had a thick coating of toasted marshmallow, graham cracker crumbles, and chocolate sauce drizzled all over the cup and saucer. There was a little graham cracker peeking out, and I just died it was that good. By then, I knew what I wanted to eat. I got the Chicken Pot Pie. It's time for a little rant. You think you've had pot pie just from those measly little frozen Marie Calendars wannabes? Yeah, well, you're wrong, because you have never eaten anything as wholesome, flavorful, hearty, and texturally variable in your life. This makes grandma's home cooking taste like dog food. I've made about four meals out of this and it will never get old. The cracker crust does not get soggy. You can taste the sage and rosemary in every bite. And can I get an amen on the presentation of these dishes? They're all so beautiful.",

It's not that far of a drive, and probably a little less crowded and a little tastier.  We got there around 11am on a Thursday & was seated right away.  Without looking at the menu I knew that I was going to share with her the chicken & waffles.  How can you make this dish even more appealing?!  By adding bacon into the waffles, which they did!  There are full strips in and coming out of the waffles!  The chicken breasts were perfectly fried and moist.  The Belgian waffles were crisp on the edges and soft and moist in the middle.  And the crispy bacon strips were a delicious and unusual twist.   Bf got the fried chicken Benedict which was just as huge, creative and tasty as well.  I still enjoyed my dish a lot more but I like how they used a chipotle cream sauce vs. typical hollandaise sauce (this is why I usually don't care for Benedicts).    Prices are fair, portions are huge, and the food is so damn good!   It can be a gamble to find all of those three winning combos in Vegas, but we've found it here at Hash House A Go Go.",

The fried leeks on top complimented the dish so well. They put a strip of bacon in the middle of their waffles!!!! Who does that? IT was amazing.   Their servings are insanely large, the picture doesn't even do it justice. I saw grown big men cutting their burgers in quarters...    You must visit this place when you go to Vegas!",

As for the food, better come hungry because the portion sizes are huge! Everyone raves about the sage chicken & waffles, as they should because it is phenomenal. I usually get the waffles with glazed bananas & pecans on top and it is one of the most delicious breakfast meals I've had to date. Also, their drinks are just as tasty. I'm a big fan of Bloody Mary's and the BLT Bloody Mary doesn't disappoint. Hot chocolate is great too!   Overall, I would say if you are looking for a hearty, delicious breakfast Hash House is a great place to go.",

We ordered a ratio of 8 dishes to 12 people, and we were BEYOND stuffed. Now, I'm able to write this review because we practically tried everything on their menu! :)  Must tries: -Banana maple pancakes (SO FLUFFY, carmelized sugar, and baked in bananas...WOW!) -Corn beef hash (great presentation, liked it way better than the HH Famous Meatloaf one) -Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict - This was AMAZING. the eggs on it were drenched in really interesting sauce. Definitely not your typical eggs benedict. -Kiwi watermelon lemonade. When you order this, and your friends see it, they're going to want one too. fair warning ;)  We also got the chicken and waffles (man vs food), and the porkloin benedict (which was kind of dry). They were all good. but I liked the top 3 i mentioned the best.  Everything was shocking and amazing. The portions were humongous. We all got drinks (mimosas, oj, and kiwi watermelon lemonade) and the bill only came out to about $15-16 a person. Such a great value meal!",

It was priced at $12.95 and the portion was generous. I am in love with this french toast and it will not be the last time I order it!   The plates of food are enormous so you must keep that in mind. Inside is normally packed but they have plenty of people working and keep things running smoothly. I was pleased to see they have a lunch and dinner menu. The breakfast will be hard to live up to but I want to come back and try out some their salads and sandwiches. You wont be disappointed I promise give it a try!",

    "text": "This review is for the restaurant as a whole and not specifically this location. My friends and I were in town for a birthday and on the way back to California, we decided to stop by at the Hash House A GoGo that was at the M Resort. I've always wanted to try this place due to the fact that i'm an avid Man vs. Food watcher.   THE FOOD: the portions are fairly big so i would recommend sharing unless you've got a big appetite and know you are able to consume that much food. I sure wish i had shared my dish with some else.  what we ordered (all very good dishes btw cause we tried each others dish):   - Farm Benedict: House smoked salmon w/ fresh asparagus, sundried tomatoes, chili cream and two basted eggs  - The Basic: Two egg breakfast any style, potatoes, fruit and biscuit (add bacon, sausage or ham)  - French Toast: Griddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup  - Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit   - Famous One Pound Stuffed Burger: Hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar  I thought that the food was pretty rich in the sauces and quite heavy. I'm not much of a breakfast eater but i did enjoy my meal here. Although i did have to take a good amount of it to go.   PRICES: each dish is about 15 dollars ( unless you get the basic breakfast/brunch dishes, which are about 9 dollars) It isn't too bad as compared to the rest of the prices from restaurants on the strip in Vegas.    SERVICE: I have to rate the service at the M Resort location to be a 2.5. Our server/waiter was one of those who you could just tell hated his job and as a result it showed in his performance and the service that was provide to my party of 8 was not that great. He even dropped a fork on my friend as he was clearing the table and said \"shit man i'm sorry\" in my opinion, that is very unprofessional. from my work experience i know the importance of excellent customer service and i definitely did not feel it here. BUT the food was pretty good and I was in good company so i was willing to over look that slight annoyance   OVERALL. i recommend you all to try it at least once. :) Check out the photos i posted too to see the dishes that my table ordered!",

Our waiter apologized, said he'd let the manager know. Finally the food came out, and it wasn't great. It wasn't even good. Chicken....very dry.

    "text": "restaurant has its reputation from travel channel and food network, so do expect the crowds and the long wait. Every time when I visit, it's at least 45 minute wait. You can order from the bar area too if you don't want the wait.  As you sit and wait for your order of food, nothing is more refreshing on a hot summer day is the kiwi watermelon lemonade. Just the look of the drink make you want to dive into it immediately. Easy to make recipe with such great combination. Bottom layer filled with 10 percent kiwi juice (POM carries their own kiwi juice), middle layer with 50 percent lemonade, and top layer with 50 percent watermelon juices (appears to be smash watermelon). Another tempting drink on their menu is the Bloody Mary, and it's not for the fainted heart or airline bloody Mary. For $8, you get a large glass of alcohol goodness. The Sage Chicken and waffles is number one choice for New York time with its reasons, it's layered with 4 bacon waffle. The waffle is perfectly made with its crisp on the outside and still piping hot in the middle with a few crunchy savory bites of bacon insides. These are not bacon bits; it's a large piece of crispy bacon that almost filed the whole waffle. Then we have 2 pieces of crispy chicken breast. From man vs. Food, they first seasoned the breast with garlic, sage, and some secret spice, and then soaked in an egg wash; they then breaded the chicken with corn flakes and flour, and then fry the chicken. My only disappointment is that the breast was a bit dried. But I'm never a fan of chicken breast, I want my dark meat. The chicken is the drizzle with some maple syrup which gives it's sweet and savory combination, and I am a lover for sweet and savory meal. The plate is garnish with a handful of fried leeks, which my husband love very much and hope to incorporates it in his dish someday. I also enjoy their little side dish of biscuit and gravy. This restaurant if definitely worth a return for me to try every dish on their menu. My next must try dish will be the stack fried green tomatoes. I will definitely give their original restaurant in San Diego a try. I've also tried the Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict as mention on man vs. Food, but since the order was a take out, it wasn't memorable. What I enjoy from the take out was the French toast with banana and walnut inside. Their portion is enough to feed two, do expect to walk out with a doggy bag. It's a great value for the dish portion. I consider this good and cheap eats.",

Fair warning though, bring your appetite!  The portions here are huge, feel free to share but you may not want to as this food ROCKS!  We love stopping in here for breakfast.  I highly recommend the Tractor Driver Combo with either the banana and brown sugar pancake or the French toast.  Simply to die for.  A friend of ours ordered the fried chicken and waffles and was in heaven saying it was better than Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.  Her bf ordered the double cheeseburger and loved every bite he could handle.  It's massive and fed 3 people.  This place does get packed so the earlier you eat the easier it is to get in.

We didn't see her for another 40+ minutes until when she came out with our food. I'm sure the kitchen was really backed up. I understand...  So I ordered the stuffed roasted red pepper and griddled smoked mozzarella burger. The portion was big. My eyes were bulging out as if a semi-stuck was coming straight at me. \"Time to dig in!!!

Nah man...my burger was barely lukewarm (my big ass plate was hotter than the burger itself), but the toasted bread was hot. The fries that came with it....burned the roof of my mouth hot!   So what happened?!?!?? =(  Anyway...I was starving so it was good. I know for sure that it would be way better if it came out hot. I'm gonna have to give this another shot in the summer because I believe in second chances and the price is just right for the amount of food you get. Until then...",

They don't use plates here - think PLATTERS, obesity and the answer to why Europeans are more healthy than us!  I ordered the delicious bacon avocado swiss and onion scramble with their crispy potatoes and a biscuit w/freshly made strawberry jam. I recommend forgoing those and trying the griddled mashed potatoes.  I found the crispy potatoes flavorless and boring.  The biscuit and strawberry jam were divine, however.  They have a full bar and feature some Midwestern kitsch - such as Milwaukees Best in a brown bag as one of the menu items.  Love the attitude on the menu.  The server almost messed up the order and gave my scramble to a couple who had just arrived.  It was corrected quickly.   Definitely worth the drive from the Strip, but if you're looking for a good breakfast and looking to get away from the casinos, save your money and try Blueberry Hill.   I think that's a better value.",

The style of food is \"farm fresh food with a twist\". Definitely do not come here alone to eat, since the portions are perhaps the biggest I've come across that literally one flapjack can feed at least 4 kids.   We had breakfast,  1 person had a pork sandwich (which was had the meat size of 3 sandwiches!), 1 person had the salad. Unless you're starving for the whole day, I recommend that you share the entrees or order the simple breakfast entree for yourself.  Everyone enjoyed their food whether it be the flapjacks, eggs benedict, scrambles or salad. The hot drinks whether it be their banana lattes or cappuccino or mocha were all good.  Service was good as well.",

    "text": "Most of the reviews are mention the few things I've noticed with this place.  1) It's not cheap for a breakfast joint.  2) You do get what you pay for.  3) The plates you get will find a family of 4 - off of just one plate.  These have to be some of the largest servings I've ever had for a regular menu item.  Taking a lunch here the other day, I ended up with a 3-5 doggy bag of Chicken Pot Pie.  I could literally wear the rosemary-bread bowl that the pie was in as a hat.  It's a classy joint, ya know, when you can order a beer in the can with a paper bag to cover it up.

I got the Smoked Salmon Hash (~$14?) with a side of bacon (~$3) and shared it with bf. We comfortably finished it.   The salmon was just meh. I always think salmon is over-cooked. Its like the canned stuff. When am I gonna learn my lesson and just stop ordering salmon at diners?   I didn't think there was anything special about this place. Its just basic breakfast foods, in larger portions. Very American.   I was looking at their dinner menu ... looks better than breakfast.   * off the strip, non-casino",

I love taking friends from out of town to Hash House for couple of reasons: its a cool local restaurant, the food is good, the price is fair, and the wow factor of the size of the dishes and they way they present them!  I've been there many times, and most items on the menu taste good except for a couple things that I won't be ordering again knowing something else on the menu taste way better: mango & coconut flapjack - its's kinda weird and flavorless butternut squash risotto - it's kinda greasy and tasteless  For dessert, do try their strawberry cobbler....mmmm soooo gooood!",

    "text": "I wanted to love Hash House a Go Go. It just didn't work out.  I've heard a lot of good things about Hash House, especially from people whose opinions are always right on.  I bought a coupon from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> while I was at work, and for the rest of the day my mouth was watering - the anxiety!  I drove to the other side of the valley to eat here with 3 friends. For some reason, it was almost dead when we entered. I decided this was a good thing, because you usually get better service.  They bring out biscuits that look like they were baked in a cake pan. Whipped butter, honey. The biscuits are amazing, but very filling.  The menu is overwhelming. I was told to order the Sage Chicken and waffles with maple reduction. I decided against it. I ordered the Boston Hash, which was severely disappointing. I love potatoes in any form. I didn't remember seeing \"scrambled eggs\" on the description, but they were on my plate. There was some asparagus, too. The fresh fruit was nowhere near ripe.   My friends ordered the ribs, a huge chicken salad with bacon, and the salmon. They were HUGE (But I felt that the plates used for the ribs and the salad should be switched)! Mine seemed more reasonable, which is what I was going for.  The crab cake was no good. They need to use less bread crumbs and more crab. The potatoes should be cut into smaller pieces. The mixture of the potatoes/tomatoes did not work for me, possibly due to the fact that the potatoes were covered in seasoning and the tomatoes were just plain and unnecessary.  They are famous for their huge portions and odd pairings. One thing I did not understand was the branch of rosemary stuck somewhere on every plate they brought out.  The service was horrible. I was eating with 3 people that have worked in the restaurant/service industry before. One of them for 10 years. We all agree that it was horrible service. He was a jerk. It's called HASH House, you'd think it wouldn't be a problem to substitute one sort of chicken for the other on a SALAD. The waiter was an asshole about it. Very abrupt and never checked on us. I gave him the worst tip I've ever given and didn't feel bad. In addition, I couldn't use my coupon because I was like $3 short of $50. Instead of telling me to order a side to go or put a dessert on the bill in order to use the $25 coupon, he ran my card anyway. A good server would've suggested that.  I'm not sure if I want to come back. I think I'll give the gift certificate to my brother, and he can enjoy it.  3 stars because apparently I ordered the worst thing on the menu and everyone else was happy. Just my luck!  Also, the portions and excellent music. Otherwise, 2 stars.",

It's a more corporate take on a fun place like Jacque-imo's in New Orleans.... in that... it's a local joint with lots of leeway for the waitstaff to be themselves. Good music and a great vibe. It was so refreshing to see men and women of unconventional beauty having fun with their clothes for work. One server looked just like Frieda Kahlo (on purpose) and our server looked straight out of a 50s car hop. The restaurant as a whole, is a feast for the eyes.  And a feast for the stomach too. The portions here are HUGE. I mean... it's like circus freak show huge. I think it's a gimmick and I'm horrified at how much waste must be created each day here.... but the WOW factor when the dish arrives at your table is undeniable.  Quality of the food is very good. It's a cut above your average breakfast restaurant and the menu items are creative and fun. A little hung over from last night's party? No problem. Order the menu item that is basically a very large beer and a side of bacon.  My first breakfast here was bread pudding (Snicker flavor) with ice cream and a cup of coffee. I'll post a pic on Yelp.",

I think, we'll split a meal next time (and will pprobably still leave food nehind).  My one regret was that my chicken and wafles were a little too...pretty?

The seasoning was perfect but if you don't like sweet then I wouldn't order it. The waffles were also cooked well and tastes like they are homemade. I will definitely go back is there were a lot of options on menu. Location was busy but expected on a Saturday Morning around 11-Noon. I sat at bar as I was solo. For groups it was like a 20-30min wait form what I heard. The place is loud but that's something to love as its fun with the hustle and bustle.

I ordered my burger medium but it wasn't more like a juicy well done which it's ok! The juicy-ness its what saved it! Not to mention it is topped with a lot of Mozzarella! My sister is a health freak so she got the Healthy start which had eggwhites, spinach and tomatoes she wanted avocado on the side! It also comes with fruit! We saw a picture of the french toast on yelp, thinking it was going to be only one big french toast but we were wrong its three huge french toast stacked together with fried bananas and walnuts! Great for dessert if you're into that lol! Overall, great atmosphere, cool music and delicious food!",

Finally, a really fun restaurant in Las Vegas that isn't on the strip.  I've been to Hash House a Go Go several times and I have to say, I'm not a fan.  Here's the deal, the food is impressive looking.  Just do an Google image search for Hash House a Go Go to see some of the creations.  The visual wowness of the food is really the only best part about it.  The biscuits are dry, crumbly and tasteless.  The \"homemade\" strawberry preserves tastes just like Smuckers.  The breakfast potatoes are bland and often undercooked.  The food that people rave about is basically food that is pretty hard to mess up, like pancakes, waffles and fried chicken.  Basically, the presentation can be summed up as this:  Stack a bunch of large portions of food on top of each other, throw some fried grass of some kind on top of it or uncooked spaghetti, and shove a large twig of rosemary down the middle to make it look fancy  I can throw food on my plate with some weeds at home.  Thanks.",

I ordered the kiwi watermelon lemonade, it was soo yummy! I wished it was bottomless refills! My cousin and I shared a sage fried chicken with bacon waffles and Andy's sage fried chicken benedict. OMG! it was way too much food! It all tasted awesome, service was good and very helpful. Definitely will be back again and try there breakfast menu.",

    "text": "3.5 STARS   We went around 4:30 pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. Upon arriving we were seated promptly by the hostess. The layout of the restaurant is very open with a bar, many tables and a few booths. Looking around you can see that their theme of \"twisted farm food\" runs consistent throughout the restaurant decor & its menu items. Our server was pretty slow and forgot about several things, granted she was new though.   We ordered a couple Bloody Marys to start out with which were deliciously refreshing. They had the perfect blend of spiciness and tanginess and were garnished with a dill pickle, jalepeno stuffed olive, lemon and a pickled green bean. If you prefer tequila over vodka opt for the Bloody Maria instead.   As entres we got the HashHouse Meatloaf Pasta and the HashHouse Chicken & Waffles. Which are two of their most popular dishes. Oh yea don't forget to ask for some complimentary honey drizzled buttermilk biscuits! The Meatloaf Pasta was in a light pesto sauce with one slice of meatloaf on top and garnished with some sort of cheese basket looking thing. The Chicken and Waffles come with 4 waffles with a slice of bacon cooked right into each one stacked high up with two pieces of fried chicken. It is garnished with fried onion shreds, drizzled with syrup and conveniently has a knife stuck right into the middle of all of it. The waffles were too soft for my liking yet the chicken was nicely fried. But to be honest with you there was nothing too special about both of these dishes.. Because at the end of the day, it's simply just meatloaf, waffles & fried chicken.. So easy to make & hard to mess up.   Yes, the portions are huge but the prices aren't cheap either. So basically what you are paying for is the presentation of the dishes. I'm sure I will be back again to try some other things but not any time soon.",

I got a breakfast omelette and it was acceptable, with nice presentation, but not excellent, and far too much cheese to enjoy.  After my second visit, my impression is now: Cheap food and a lot of it!  All the \"phactory - phood\" you can possibly eat, at above average prices.    Ordered a \"Fresh Mushroom with Swiss Cheese Burger\" at the Sahara Ave Las Vegas store today and it arrived with enormous mounds of meat, over a pound of burger meat, which turned out to be of very poor taste and low quality. If I had to guess the meat, it would has guessed road kill, as it even smelled bad. I took one bite and (almost vomited) immediately ejected the bite from my mouth. I ate half the fries with some ketchup and was done.  $15 down the drain.  Frankly, I will not return to Hash House a Go Go again.  I like a good burger and at half the price, IN-N-OUT gets my vote with much better taste and far better quality.",

On my return trip I wanted to come back to the original location in Vegas. I've seriously dreamed about this place. I have raved to friends that Hash House will ruin breakfast at all other places. The husband and I ordered enough for 4, but I really wanted him to try everything.  Pumpkin Latte - perfect balance of pumpkin flavor.  Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles - still the absolute best Chicken and Waffles! Chicken breast was perfectly fried and moist. Waffles had bacon strips in them!  Snickers Pancakes - love that they are the size of a pizza pie! A little disappointed since I love the mango coconut pancake I had 4 years ago. The husband loves snickers and isn't a fan of coconut, so he picked this one. Good, but a little drier. Pancakes with fruit are the way to go.  Sausage Hash - tasty with peppers, sausage and goat cheese. Potatoes were yummy too!   We finished most of the food as this was our pre-trip home lunch stop before heading to the airport for a 6 hour flight. Staff was friendly. I look forward to coming back the next time we are in town.   *Chicken & Waffles is a MUST!",

Our server was friendly and periodically checked on our satisfaction.  The Pork Tenderloin Sandwich was as large as a 1956 Oldsmobile hubcap. The outside was crispy and inside very tender and juicy. Unless you want a second meal, I suggest that 2 people share one order.  The Meatloaf meal consists of a large layer of mashed potatoes topped by 2 country biscuits followed by a slab of meatloaf and finely covered with crispy onion straws. Way far too much starch for me. The meatloaf was a little on the dry side and could have used some gravy.  The menu is large and varied from breakfast through dinner. You are not likely to leave hungry.",

When we finally got our drinks, our coffee was old and on the burner for way too long. Had to ask for fresher coffee, from someone who wasn't our server. My husband and daughter ordered eggs, fried potatoes, meat, and toast. I ordered Country Fried Steak and eggs.  And as other reviews have pointed out, the service is slow and, the food did not come out at the same time. My husband and daughter both got their food and we had to wait on mine. When my CFS came out it was burned past a crisp. The steak itself was tougher than shoe leather, Also burned. Under the CFS was a growing pile of old used oil. The eggs were swimming in grease. Not just mine but my husband's as well. My daughter stated that hers, that were scrambled, were more rubbery than anything. The bread for all of our meals had a huge sprig of Rosemary speared into it. Which of course, the toast picked up. None was happy about the added flavor of Rosemary. The food was inedible. We had to wait, surprise, for anyone to show up. And the staff, including the manager, was surprised that we were not happy with our food. I had to request that the food be taken off of the bill. Sadly the hype this place has garnered does not live up to the miserable time we had here.",

Service was amazing. Refilled my coffee quickly, brought extra syrup.... attentive without hovering over you!",

Was the wait worth it...yes.   I'm pretty much a traditional boring person when it comes to food. I like the simpler flavor versus the crazy unique flavors. Whenever I am here I order the corned beef hash which is definitely one if my favorites. Tender corned beef with skillet potatoes and Swiss cheese on top. I'm a cheesy girl and that cheese as weird as it may sound actually pairs well with it. I actually have ordered something off the special menu as well.  The crab cake Benedict on Mother's Day was pretty dang tasty. There was real crab and the crab vs. batter/filling ratio was about 2:1. It came with spinach and a spicy sauce (spicy to me) which was delicious.   I've ordered drinks from HHAGG before and although good it's just too much. Their famous hot chocolate is huge! It's awesome but when I eat salty foods I like to drink the plain old H20. Overall I do like this place for brunch/breakfast but service can be a bit on the slow side when they have a full house.",

The service was impeccable. It literally took us 8 min to get seated (with a party of 5) and our waiter was cooooool cool. (and cute to boot!)  In my opinion, there is only 1 place on the planet (I've persoanally tried) that is an equal. SHOPSINS.... in essex street market in New York. (see review)  Today, it was Jen vs Food... Jen won.",

The biscuit was too dry and no where as good as the biscuits at the Pork Store  restaurant in SF.  I liked the mashed potatoes.  Many diners left 1/3 to 1/2 of the food on their plates which would've been more than welcomed by the homeless folks hanging out on the Strip. Service was good and as we were sitting by the kitchen, you'd hear the staff yell as they go in and out to warn others they were on the move.  The place is crowded with a wait of 20 mins for us in the AM.  Hubby says he'd go back to try other things when we return to LV again. The menu is extensive.",

It makes for a good bang for your buck. The food isn't bad. Maybe a glorified 'Denny's' kind of place. But it's definitely not ape-shit worthy. And of course they had that Guy Fieri show playing on their TV. For my most recent visit, I tried their new 'Nappanee Hash' which consisted of two eggs, a huge biscuit, potatoes, beef and veggies all mixed together into one big pile. And some pieces of fruit. I killed it alone but I ended up not eating anything for the rest of the day. I also got unusually sleepy right away. It didn't look all that great, but it tasted ok and really it was like two meals in one.  I also thought the food came out kind of slowly as well which is somewhat disappointing. But the service was outstanding. Each time I've been here, I've had consistently good service.  It's not bad to have a cheat meal here and if you split your meal with someone, then it turns into a very inexpensive outing. Give it a try. There's no reason to stay away if you are curious. Just don't complain about your love handles afterwards! ;)",

Are usually go to the one that is inside of the link, but today went to one off the strip since it was closer to me. The food was amazing as always and the service was great. But... I ordered the meatloaf hash and the tractor combo with giant brown sugar banana pancake.  Both were amazing. But I couldn't help to notice that the pancake was literally 1/3 the size that it used to be a couple years ago.  I don't know if it gradually got smaller over time or it happened in one step because people were wasting and throwing it away so often because it was so big. It used to be so big and almost an inch thick. It took two people to finish it and even that was a huge struggle.   Today I ate my whole tractor combo, as a dessert plate after I finished the hash house meatloaf which was much smaller than it previously was as well. The food is great and the portions are still decent size so I will continue to come here regardless. But I can't be the only one that has noticed the portion size change all across the board.   I did come today at lunch so I don't know if that has any bearing on the size of the portions.",

    "text": "So apparently when I'm in vegas, my diet goes out the window. Rather than doing our usual brunch buffet at the Wynn or other casinos, we opted to get Hash House. I wanted to go to this location off the strip because the wait isn't as long (I get very angry when I'm hungry. The snickers bar commercials where ppl turn into crazy angry hungry monsters definitely applies to me haha). ALSO after we left, we met BJ PENN & GOT A PHOTO W/ HIM!!! :D Being a girl that's into MMA, I was so happy.  There's patio seating outside for those that want to get your tan on in the nevada sun, but we opted for indoor seating. The service was very friendly, no complaints there  FOOD:  Mushroom, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, artichoke scrambled egg white hash & ordered extra side of ham steak - What can I say? I'm a petite girl w/ a big appetite. I devoured this whole cast iron plated meal except for a few pieces of potatoes. You seriously get enough potato wedges to last for days here. Everything was cooked perfectly. Eggs weren't overcooked. There were plenty of mushroom, spinach, etc. The biscuit was warm and flaky, I doused it in butter and honey. I was in heaven! The ham steak was huge, but good and not super salty  Chicken Pot Pie - My friend ordered this dish & I helped him out a little 'cause I was still hungry after eating my dish LOL. I loved how this wasn't just ordinary chicken pot pie. It's served in a cute giant hat w/ gravy oozing everywhere. Dish came out piping hot and fresh! There were plenty of chicken breast pieces throughout each bite and yes...loads of potato wedges. I really like the gravy here, everything tasted so home made. I'd recommend this dish over the fried chicken biscuit benedict  Andy's Fried Chicken Biscuit Benedict - 2 of our friends ordered this and it was just ok to me. I know it's a popular item, but it really did just taste like fried chicken w/ biscuits...nothing too special. At least the fried chicken wasn't too greasy  Watermelon lemonade - IT LOOKED SO AWESOME!! check out my pic <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2F0Eh9jlsKXJIN8N9CuLnIsQ%2Fms.jpg&s=d0e2ee5506486da8fc57a2382332213b9c440eeea06be1f55a830f7bbea32800\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a> Tasted really refreshing and not super sweet. The watermelon wasn't overpowering either.  Caramel Coffee w/ scoop of vanilla ice cream - So my friend ordered this cause we had serendipity the night before. This basically tasted like any other frappe, but great palate cleanser for all that food!  I love the big portions at hash house and the pricing is just right for what you get!! I know they have one back home in CA,but it's all the way in SD :( They're expanding like crazy in vegas, how about building one in Orange County?!",

We were told about the portion after I order their famous Sage Fried Chicken with waffles ($18.99) AND Man Vs Food favorite, Sage fried Chicken Benedict ($15.99). I told her I'm hungry and hey, I'll have the leftovers for breakfast tmr! Win-win!   Our table also got the crispy polenta with melted Brie and grilled portobello mushroom and they hash house salad and chocolate chip pancakes! Not forgetting the pretty kiwi watermelon lemonade!   Food came and True to their words, they stared off with a huge plate of giant biscuits. It was really good! Super soft. But please don't get carried away eating them coz when your delicious giant plates of food come, you might not be able to devour and enjoy it with a stomach full of biscuits. I learnt the hard way. Went back later that night and finished my leftovers! Lol! What breakfast?   Food was delicious by the way. For the price, Totally worth every.single.bite.",

There's tons of brunch options, from creatively made coffees to different kinds of eggs benny to flapjacks. And 1 pancake alone will feed a family of 4. You have been warned. They have a lunch menu as well but their breakfast is where it's at. Get there early on the weekends because this particular location gets packed. Funny and friendly waitstaff, freshly made hot coffee and speedy efficient service. I love that it's off the strip too and away from the hustle and bustle.",

Huge portions!  We went for Easter breakfast - busy but we had a reservation for 10 and sat in the comfiest booth ever. Service took a little while in the beginning but since we had plenty of time to figure out what we wanted food came quickly.  My boyfriend and are are vegetarian - again, not my choice to come to this restaurant being a vegetarian LOL but we chose what we could (healthy + vegetarian = oatmeal .. that's it.) Their oatmeal was TERRIBLE. It was super mushy and not good at all.   However, my mom had the fried green tomato dish w/ chicken salad on top .. she loved it and the fried green tomatoes were DELISH.  Not my favorite spot - but nice atmosphere. Also - I've heard the BLT bloody mary's are to die for!",

We arrived past lunch hour but before happy hour so there was not a wait. The staff was so friendly with everyone greeting us. We explained to our waitress that it was our first time and she took extra time explaining the popular items. I selected a hash with eggs, chicken, asparagus, and potatoes. I mentioned I was gluten sensitive and she said we could substitute the fried potatoes for the mashed.I kept the biscuit for the hubby. I ordered scrambled eggs instead of my usual over easy. The hubby ordered a burger. He could only eat half. He loved the fries too.  My order came out with the fried potatoes and our waitress admitted she forgot to make the change and pleasantly immediately got me the side order of mashed. Best waitress ever. By tge way, the homemade peach jam was amazing. We ate our meal with ohs and ahs as we enjoyed our food and the immense portions. Will we return? Absolutely. Will we take our out of town guests? For sure. Are there healthy options? Yes! The salads looked great.",

They greeted us right away and we chose to sit in the bar. Shane was the bartender and he told us about happy hour and got our drinks ordered right away. We told him we had never been for dinner so he made some suggestions and told us about the blue plate meals for $10. I went with the chicken and biscuits meal on the blue plate menu since that was Wednesday's special. My husband went with Shane's suggestion of the meatloaf. We ordered the fries and cucumber ranch off the happy hour menu. Everything was fantastic. I loved my meal and so did my husband. Hug portions but he did remind us of that. Now we have left overs for today. We will definitely be back to this location for dinner again. Thank you Shane for all your help.   We have been back since and had another amazing bartender as well as fantastic food.",

I ordered the Chorizo Hash (Chorizo, Jalapeno, Cheddar Cheese, Potatoes, Eggs, Biscuit, Peppers & Onions).  TBH ordered the Salmon Benedict.  To wash it down, I had the Mango/Peach Iced Tea.  After a short wait, the food came out.  Since we have been here before, we knew what was in store for us....a massive plate of food.  Adam Richman from Man vs Food picked a great spot to host his show.....portions are LARGE!  You have to bring your A-Game to finish your plate.  My strategy was simple....I will save the Biscuit for the end.  Biscuits are stomach busters.  I added some Tabasco and dove into the Chorizo Hash & Eggs.  It was very good!  The combination of ingredients had a good flavor to it.  The saltiness of the Chorizo combined with the gooey Cheddar Cheese and hot Potatoes made for a huge plate of Awesome!  I wish there were more Jalapenos on it though....it didn't seem to have enough of them.....kind of light.  The Eggs were prepared Over Easy just the way I like it....with the runny Egg Yolk covering the Hash when I broke the seal.  As I said, the Biscuit was last and I ate most of it with the final third of my dish....it was puffy & buttery....delicious and filling.  TBH enjoyed her Salmon Benedict, but could only manage to finish 1/2 the plate.  I packed up the other half for later.  Overall, it was a great experience, just like the first time.  Will I return?  Soon....very soon!",

It was a tough portion of meat (which for brisket means it needed a bit more slow cooking) with some decent potatoes that came on a cold skillet. With the biscuit and side of fruit, it felt like a lot of food but it was overall just....heavy and bland.   Also, will you people stop this bullsh*t of putting bacon into everything?! Bacon mixed into the waffle. Bacon in the mashed potatoes. I don't eat the stuff, but even if I did, bacon is not a cheap substitute for knowing how to season your food.   On the positive side, service was really nice and attentive, and we didn't have to wait too long before being seated.   I don't know if I'd go back, honestly. Its sort of out of the way, a little pricy, and the few things I could eat were more calorie bombs than bombtastic. Maybe if someone else is paying, I'll try it again.",

But, it's not great....Idk it' sort of just trying too hard, in my opinion. I feel like they're trying to stuff too many flavors into one dish.  Iv'e been there about three times and every time I leave super stuffed but kind of disappointed... but that's just me   Sometimes less is more",

    "text": "-WOW!-  Chicken Benedict  and Bloody Mary! The Benedict is sooooooo good two people can eat it, sometimes I wish there was more sauce because the chicken breast is so big, but otherwise this thing is heaven on a plate!  Blood Mary is so good I could drink a gallon of it and pass out. Could be a little stiffer for the price.  My date had bacon waffles, but they forgot to put the bacon in it. Tragic.  They made up for it by giving us a side of bacon but it was not the same. At least they wanted to make us happy, so I cannot complain, but it does get very busy in there and it seems the staff gets a little spread thin.  The chicken and waffles is a huge pile of fantastic food mountain, its crazy. This dish is similar to the Benedict but the waffle and syrup makes it more of a savory sweet plate.  I come here on my days off when I know I have nothing to do after I eat because this food makes me extremely relaxed and lazy.  So many other things on the menu I would like to try.",

Other than that, I don't see what the big deal is.  I ordered the smoked salmon scramble and it was nasty... or shall I say fishy?  Whatever... fishy/nasty/gross, I couldn't eat it.  I never send anything back, but this time I did because I couldn't tolerate another bite and I didn't want to just sit there and watch all my friends eat.  My boyfriend ordered the corned beef and I must say that his dish was DELICIOUS!  Probably the best corned beef I've ever had.  I was going to order that for myself, but my BF was like, \"why don't you share this with me and order something else so we can try something different?\"  Umm okay, what do you want me to order?  I ordered another scramble dish with chorizo in it.  So  yeah, my second attempt?  FAIL!!!  That dish was equally disgusting.  At least I have my BF's corned beef to share right?  WRONG!  He had practically polished off his dish by the time I wanted to dig in to it.  Thanks for sharing hun!  If you're going to eat here because it was on Man vs. Food, order the chicken and waffles or the corned beef.  Everything else is a waste of time!",

Every time I go here I always get good service and nothing bad seems to happen. They have set hours for breakfast/lunch and dinner.

    "text": "Holy Hash House.  Are you aware of how much food you give people?  And how good it is?  I just went here twice in the past 4 days because of how good, and reasonably priced for the Strip it is.    First time I ordered the Pork Tenderloin Benedict.  I thought \"hey, I'm a pretty hungry guy\", I can tackle this mound of delicious potatoes, eggs, fried pork tenderloin with d-licious barbeque cream sauce (say it again, bbq cream sauce.  picture sausage gravy, but bbq style.  mmmm).  It came and my jaw dropped (see picture).  I ate a third of it or less, and I was STARVING, and I am not the skinniest person in the world!  This place should just call itself a man vs food challenge, which actually had an episode here.  It tastes soooo good.  Made me wish I had a fridge in my hotel room  Second time I had the chicken and waffles.  To picture this skyscraper of chicken on top of waffles doesn't do it justice... again see picture!!!  You want a little more info?  Ok, those gigantic waffles on the bottom are STUFFED WITH BACON.  Yes, I didn't stutter.  Incredible.  To my credit I demolished the chicken and a couple of the waffles, but this is truly a gargantuan dish.  I totally get how others might have complained about the wait, since I walked by a couple times and saw a ton of people, but I didn't wait at all both times I went, so no complaints there.  Also have great fresh squeezed OJ tangerine juice (who knew!)  Only question is, when are they going to open one of these places where I live?!",

I found this gem with my fabulous Yelp app.  We love to hit up a delicious place on the drive back to Phoenix and the Hash House did not disappoint.  Before we pulled up, I was expecting to see a hole-in-the-wall type of dive-y place (with a name like \"hash house\" that is what I pictured),  man was I off!  Nice prominent outside and an inside atmosphere that feels modern/industrial and yet cozy/family environment at the same time.    The walk from the door to the hostess stand was a little icy . . . the two girls didn't smile at all, however they did quickly seat us, which was nice.  Our server was great, I forget her name (sorry). She explained that they don't use microwaves or heat lamps; as soon as your food is ready, you get it.  Very cool! She had a nice positive energy, like someone who enjoyed her job.    Like all of the other reviews say, the food is phenomenal!  And the portions are HUGE!!!  Some of the most unique and creative menu items, yet all sound like the most delicious dish ever.  My BF got the fried chicken with mashed potatoes, eggs, and bacon.  I am not a huge fan of fried chicken, but this might have turned me.  Melt in your mouth, moist chicken and a perfect, well-seasoned, light, crispy breading. Yum!  And my breakfast was one of my favorite breakfasts of all time.  A vegetable hash with artichokes, mushrooms, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes . . . you know all the good stuff . . . not the silly filler veggies of normal breakfast places.  Served with potatoes and two eggs (over-medium) so I can spread the runny yolk all over my vegetable goodness.  My mouth is drooling just thinking about you.  Your's will too . . . just check out my pics of this stuff!  Oh, and how could I forget the homemade biscuits and homemade jam (\"strawberry today\" the server told us).  Again, I've never been a huge biscuit fan, but these were by far the best I've ever had.  Huge, softball size, light, flaky, buttery.  And that jam . . . oh, my goodness, I HAVE to go back!!  I almost shed a tear when I couldn't take home my leftovers, there was no where to stash them for the 5 hour drive home.  Whaw, whaw, whaaaaawn.  Next time . . . I will not wait until the last morning of my trip to go back!  As a matter of fact, we may just have to hit Hash House a Go Go on the way into Vegas next time!!",

Well, the chicken was absolutely amazing - juicy and tender. The waffles part of the equation was also good. It was an interesting dynamic to have bacon inside the waffles. I just wish I had more maple sauce (I suppose I should have asked).  Other people at the table had different variations of a hash dish. From what I tried, those were also good. For me though, it's all about the chicken and waffles.",

Wasn't sure whether to go for breakfast or dinner but ended up there for dinner due to poor lack of planning and we only had one more day in Vegas.     We arrived at 7 pm and there  was only a few people in the restaurant.  We were immediately sat down and a nice waitress came over to help.     I ordered one of those kiwi watermelon lemonades spiked.   Very good but not enough liquor!!    Got a chicken sandwich with the recommendation of the bacon cheese mashed potatoes by the waitress.  I asked for the mayonnaise on the side since I wasn't sure how much they would slather on.   Husband ordered the chicken pot pie which the waitress warned came with a cracker style crust.     Food came out very quick and had a dramatic presentation.     Thought the sage fried chicken on the sandwich was soggy and rather bland.   Also the cheese on top of the potatoes was microwaved to the point of being hard.  Peeled it off and the potatoes underneath were fine.  I ate a better part of it and the waitress said I did a great job!   Husband thought the chicken pot pie was different but good.    I think I will try this place for breakfast next time I go and see if the food is any better.   Wonderful service though!",

I just found out I am allergic to sage, but i will risk it for one bite of this yummyness.!  Go here if you like to eat large portions.  If you want to split a meal, go for it. If you just wanna be amazed at how much one person can eat, GO HERE!",

The drinks are overpriced, but they double up on the alcohol, so I couldn't complain. Decent Red Snapper, forgot to ask for it spicy. Went with the Man V Food favorite, Fried Chicken Benedict, and it was HUGE! The biscuits were awesome; tasty, fresh and not dry at all.  The chicken was crisp and moist and the flavors were spot on and balanced out the dish. It was terrifically delicious! The guy next to me got the Chicken and Waffles, which is next on my list when I head back for sure.  5 stars because it lived up to my expectations, and they the Indy MotoGP race on as well!!!! Booze, Breakfast and Bikes! What else could a hungry little racer boy want?!?!?!",

I definitely recommend people to share their dished with the table because the portions are overwhelmingly big. As for the dishes, they are extremely unique in ingredients and they have great culinary presentation......In otherwards, they are a little pricy, but you'll at least get your money worth with the big portion. I'd categorize this place as a casual upperscale diner. Make sure you're prepared for the long wait to be seated because this place is packed!!! But once you're seated, the waiters are quiet to get orders around.",

Awesome things: Got seated quickly (A+)  People who ordered hot coffee thought it was great (A+)  The food was decent (Solid B).   Although it wasn't the best Hash House experience we have had. Food and service-wise it doesn't really live up to the San Diego Location. Generally thought the food was a little more bland (although still good and still giant portions) iced coffee tastes suuuppper watered down (like it was hot coffee over ice, although I can't say that is actually what it was. Just what it reminded me of). Waitress seemed annoyed generally by us and wasn't afraid to say so (although we tried to be polite and friendly as most of us have worked in restaurants before). Also, no soap in the men's bathroom which is pretty gross (since ya know, employees most likely use it as well).  All-in-all is was totally fine. We left not being hungry anymore and got to have a decent breakfast together.",

    "text": "Hash Hash a No-No.   The hubby had been talking about how wonderful this place was so we finally came in for lunch.  We were seated right away, but had the worse table facing the kitchen and a garbage can:( So that doesn't not exactly wet your appetite. I could have waited for a booth, but it's crunch time at lunch time.  Strike 1  We had a very friendly waiter.  He brought out drinks quickly but my Ice-tea was yucky-strike 2-how do you screw up ice-tea.  I asked for a soda in exchange and he promptly exchanged the drink with no problems.  Our waiter was super friendly. So five stars for the service.  Kiddo had a grilled cheese, but the cheese was not melted-(strike 3), we took it back, got it back melted. We split the crab cake salad and it was okay, by that I mean it was edible.  Not digging the decoration on the plate (dried spaghetti sticks?) I didn't get it.  Also on the plate was a hard biscuit that was flavorless-a piece of paper would have tasted better.  Very disappointing.  The stand out was the cup of cream corn chowder-this gets five stars, honestly it was sooooo delish!!  I have to agree with other yelpers, the servings are disgustingly huge and so are many of the customers-there were plenty of linebackers at every table.  So if you've got a big appetite com here.  Another 5-Star was the jamming tunes-the place had awesome music!   Lots of pics on the wall of celebrity guests like Rachel Ray, Martha Stewart, etc. that was cool!  I think I may still come back and give it another try-maybe a new chef is in order.",

    "text": "A friend and I decided to try out Hash House A Go Go for the first time because of rave reviews others have given. Upon receiving the food, I noticed that the presentation was aesthetically pleasing and the portions were (far too) generous. I'm the type of person who would opt out from paying a little more money for a lot more food I don't want to finish.  I had the Big 'Ol Chicken Pot Pie solely because I was craving chicken pot pie while my friend had...the pork tenderloin? I'm not quite sure and never got to try it so I'll skip that in the review. All I remember was that the blue cheese mash it came with was delish.  The pot pie wasn't in the traditional form of a pie but came in a giant hat-shaped bread-crust with chicken pot pie filling piled into a plate. I appreciate the fried garnishes on top and the noticeable amount of rosemary in the crust as well. The filling was hot and soft and well-rounded.   However, the crust was just okay to me and half the reason I get any kind of pie is for a good flaky crust. The crust in this pie was a bit too hard and cold. Maybe I missed some kind of memo that warned customers of the deviation from the norm.  If I were to judge this place on just their Big 'Ol Chicken Pot Pie, I would have rated it a 4/5 but I also had the opportunity to taste their (nonalcoholic) Kiwi-Watermelon Lemonade and Strawberry Lemonade. And for the price, I was definitely unimpressed. They just tasted so ordinary when people had hyped me up beforehand into thinking they would be amazing.  I do want to go back again and try their breakfast sometime in the near future, though.",

There was a whole lot of \"Ohhhh, what is that?!\" going on as we watched plate after plate of giant portions of breakfast food being served with all matter of spiky garnishes.  I had the Hash House salad with chicken breast. Normally not something you can add excitement factor to, but they managed to do just that! Mango vinaigrette was amazing. It also had homemade cornbread croutons.   Portions were gigantic. Atmosphere is also very very cool and hip...you'll almost forget you're in Vegas. It's like the American Southwest meets downtown Seattle. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars and not 5 is the wait time. Please, open another location!",

Let's just say that the food won in this challenge. The second time I had the French Toast. It was just okay... The third time, the ginormous Chicken and Waffles. What a giant tower! I think I had only ate half. Each time we came, the wait was pretty long for any parties larger than 4. I'm glad that more locations opened in Las Vegas over the years, so the wait is not as long any more. If you think you are able to finish massive amounts of food like in these pictures, then this is the place for you! Or... sharing is caring: you can always share a plate ;)",

At the time, it was empty.  Before we knew it, it was filling up quickly.  Fortunately our party showed up and we were seated.    We looked around, the portions are insanely big... even where you can easily share just about anything and leave feeling stuffed.  Someone next to use has a pancake that was literally the size of a pizza and about half an inch thick.  I ordered the french toast and a Diet Coke (the theme of my recent Vegas reviews since I started the weekend on three hours of sleep).  For some reason, this weekend in Vegas, I couldn't, for the life of me, get a Diet Coke.  The waitress served me a water but kept forgetting my Diet Coke throughout the meal.  I literally had to remind her four times and on the fourth time (when I was already done) she brought it out.  Fortunately she comped it.  Good place overall... cool, fun vibe.",

Otherwise everything is pretty yellow due to the light bulbs. There's also a choice between a booth or a table.   Our server was Kyle and he did a great job! He introduced himself and immediately greeted us in a friendly manner, got our drink orders and made some recommendations as to what's popular. I went for the chicken and waffles, my boyfriend got the pork tenderloin and we shared a gigantic red velvet pancake. As soon as I saw all the food, I realized I wasn't as hungry as I thought I was.   I ate as much as I could and took about half of it home. The way they plate and decorate their food is unique, the knife stabbed into it is a real eye catcher.

While my wife was in the bathroom I let our server know we were celebrating her birthday.  He assured me it wouldn't be a problem-the birthday waffle they provide would come out seamlessly after the meal. He said he would order it when we were nearing completion of our meals so it would come out right after dinner.  Well, after our server took our order I really didn't see him.  The other server brought our meals out, and the host cleared the plates.  After our plates were cleared it was 10 minutes before we saw our server (I'm guessing this is when the actual order for the birthday waffle was put in).  I told him we would have to forgo the birthday waffle because it was too long and the 7 year old was getting restless. He told me it was coming right out.  It was another 5 minutes before it arrived.  He dropped it on the table with the check without saying happy birthday or any thanks for coming in tonight.  He did say the waffle was on the house for the birthday celebration but he didn't seem very sincere.  I got the feeling he was a little perturbed that I questioned the length of time it took. And I'm not positive but I thought every table was getting complimentary biscuits except for us. Once again it, as well as the meal, was delicious but the lack of customer service definitely took away from the experience.  I'll still give it 4 stars because that's how good the food is.",

    "text": "First of all, please put up pictures of your more exotic dishes at the restaurant.  Sometimes words can not describe what this dish is supposed to taste like, but pictures speak a thousand words.  Secondly, the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade is a pure stroke of genius.  You have given me an idea for a new party drink creation - KiwiWaterLemon Soju.  Next, let's go on to A_____, your very defensive waiter.  I asked him to describe a \"Scramble\" and he told me what it was.  My response was \"Oh.  Okay,  So it's kinda like a Denny's breakfast skillet.\"  He then got pretty irritated and told me that it's not anything like that.  \"And unlike Denny's, we use fresh ingredients that probably came in from California this morning.\"  Geez.  Okay.  Relax.  So I was fucking wrong.  Excuse me.  Just correct me, don't treat me like an idiot.  I should have walked out at that point.  Lastly, do NOT eat the \"HH Famous Meatloaf, roasted red peppers, fresh spinach and smoked mozzarella\" (House Hash) served with eggs on a bed of crispy potatoes.  The meatloaf is tasteless, dry and gray.  There's a great biscuit, but no country gravy.  I ate the eggs and a little bit of the meatloaf, then let the rest of it rot.  This is a poorly designed dish and it should be removed from the menu.  Would I come back and give Hash House A Go Go another chance?  Of course I would.  But to be fair, except for the great lemonade, my experience was pretty sub-par.  I need to be 'WOW\"ed the next time.",

A whole banana, melon slices, apple slices, berries - and a very small amount of honey to sweeten it all.

I devoured my plate, maple syrup and all. The problem now, is all I want to do is get home to my bed, fast asleep I will fall.   My friends birthday celebration was what got us to go,  No sing along birthday song, but that's okay, we were too far in a coma, to mention that they were wrong.   Luckily the scene was interesting, The waitress was great and the place was really clean.   There was no wait, parking was a breeze,  We got into our table, in the booth, with nothing but ease.  Not sure if it would be the same on a Sunday morning or full moon,  More than likely getting a table would mean sitting in a state of doom.

We waited the 15 minutes, and I have to say, it was well worth it. Lol Snickers Bread Pudding. Anyways...we ordered a house salad with the cucumber dressing, the friend green tomato stack with chicken salad, goat cheese with a balsamic reduction, and the Crispy Fried Fresh Salmon. Omg the flavors of everything were amazing!! The deep fried string beans!!!!! The garlic mashed potatoes!! The salmon with extra crispy corn meal crust!! The fried green tomatoes were pretty awesome  as well. We ended the meal with the Snickers Bread Pudding and as I mentioned before, it's with the 15 min extra wait. Enjoy your meal and company, a little longer here!  Shane was our server and offered suggestions and was attentive and very friendly.  Thank you Hash House A Go-Go!!",

Drink refills were sparse, I asked for extra syrup, it never came.    Waited about another 10 mins for our check.   We were missing silverware.     The food was good.  Giant portions. Everybody could pretty much split a meal. The kids meals or giant as well.    Chicken and Waffles are my favorite. Sage and chicken dish is really delicious. I've had the grilled cheese today and said it was good except the tomatoes made grilled cheese sandwich soggy.   The size of potatoes  I ordered were discusting.  Burnt and dry.      We will be back.   Can't let one  visit keep me from coming back.",

So many great options its hard to decide if youre there to visit. I wish wish I had this place in Florida. Vegas has such amazing places especially off the strip! I could go on amd on about how yumptious this place is and how gigantor the food portions are, but I will let you find out by going there. Servers are super nice and informative as well.",

I'm talking they are as large as your head and basically just as tall.   For this particular visit, my husband and I arrived around 10 a.m. on a Saturday. It wasn't too crazy, and we were sat right away. My one small compliant for this place was it was rather noisy - I think this mainly had to do with being close to the entrance and the kitchen, but it wasn't unbearable. Our intentions for this visit were to enjoy some delicious breakfast foods paired with coffee and of course mimosas. We received our coffee and mimosas quickly (less than 5 minutes after placing our order). The mimosa was an excellent one with plenty of champagne and not drowning in OJ. It even came with a fresh orange slice on the glass. Fresh brewed coffee was also decent (side note here that they also have Nitro Cold Brew and other very fun choices for hot coffee!).   Next came the food. My husband had the Chicken Fried Benedict while I enjoyed their famous Chicken and Waffles. The amount of food that came out was astonishing. We could have easily split a single plate. The cream sauce on the Benedict was absolutely perfect. The chicken and waffles got better as I enjoyed the bacon baked right INTO the waffle! They also provided a small pitcher of warm syrup which always makes waffles better. It also went perfectly with the two very large chicken breasts perched on top. I will absolutely be returning to try more of their menu!   The service throughout our entire visit was quick and very pleasant. I highly recommend this place for any time of the day!",

I went there for breakfast with a colleague. We were seated side-by-side facing a giant TV set playing Food TV scenes I had seen already. I ordered a ham-spinach-and-cheese scramble with crispy fried potatoes.  The scramble was mediocre, the \"crispy\" potatoes had a hard shell, and the biscuit was dry and had some kind of herb sprig incongruously shoved in it.  It wasn't bad, really, it just wasn't very good. The biggest disappointment was the next day, when I was short on time and grabbed myself a McDonald's biscuit sandwich. The McDonald's biscuit was moist, fluffy and tasty -- more so than the one I had had for a higher price the day before.  Disappointing.",

    "text": "* $40 breakfast for two * Peculiar meat loaf * Stale coffee * Watery hot chocolate for $4.50 * Gargantuan portions  This gimmick of this place is comically heaping portions served on platters the size of toilet seats. That makes up for the mediocre food.  The oversized cutlery is another source of amusement. It's like they got a good deal on all this jumbo dinnerware and decided to build a theme around it. Throw in a dorky slogan (\"Twisted Farm Food\") and you have a sure-fire formula.  The popularity of this establishment demonstrates how easily manipulated people are. It was featured on a TV show. It MUST be good, right? I was suckered into having a meal here but I wasn't captivated by the herd instinct that keeps the throngs flocking in.  I had a meat loaf hash. My culinary experience has not encompassed many types and varieties of meat loaf, so for all I know this was a special gourmet meat loaf that I have not been properly schooled to appreciate. To me it was just peculiar. The waitress informed me that it's a combination of pork and beef. The meat seemed overly ripe. It was compressed like salami, not flaky like typical meatloaf. The hash had big hunks of salami-like meat loaf, home fries, spinach and peppers.  The hash is served in a heavy cast iron skillet. The rock-hard biscuit had a sprig of Rosemary poking out of it like a Christmas tree.  There was also a dry Paul Bunyan-sized flapjack accompanied by tiny beaker of syrup not nearly enough to sweeten the flapjack. With the oversized theme, why wouldn't they provide a quart jar of syrup?  The hot chocolate came in a bowl-sized mug with chocolate syrup drizzled on the saucer and sprinkles of cinnamon and syrup on top.  Marshmallows floated in the chocolate. I suppose that makes it worth $4.50 even though it was just an envelope of Nestles mixed with too much lukewarm water.  The music is way too loud. They were out of wheat bread, so we had to take rye toast that was just thick slices of stale bread. The coffee had that acrid, overly cooked, bottom-of-the-pot taste.  The room has a strange industrial decor with panels of diamond-tread aluminum and semi-gloss stainless steel. Pointless steel cables sort of lace the whole place together. I would rather eat in a place that emphasizes good food over an oddball decor.  On top of that we weren't served water.",

Maybe just as big as a table charger.  large orange juice ($5.50)  Smores Mocha($6.25) - It looked so tempting in the picture, but it kinda fell short for me. After sipping/spooning/eating the top of the drink that had the marshmallows floating with drizzles of chocolate syrup and the graham crackers on the side, and all was left was the actual mocha drink, the joy of this drink died out for me.

The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that 1) the bartenders struggled to keep up with the orders of my group (basically a few bloody marys and a few mimosas) and 2) the location is a bit out of the way, about a $20 cab ride from the strip.",

First off its super crowded every time you go there (been there twice) and they don't take reservations. One good thing is they do have a bloody mary bar so at least you can drink while you wait but being severely hungover and standing around for 15+ minutes is never ideal. The portions here are HUGE so make sure to share with a friend or two, even if you normally eat a lot. Me and two others shared the Man V Food Special Benedict, Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. The presentation while huge was nice (and intimidating) but all in all the flavor just wasn't there. This is definitely a cool place to visit once in your life if just for the gigantic porportions and bloody mary bar but not top on my list taste wise.",

    "text": "This is one of those 6 or 8 star reviews . . . I seriously think this is the best breakfast/brunch dining experience I've ever had.  The wait on a Saturday AM for two was supposed to be about 45 minutes according to the server, but it was more like 25, as we arrived just after the breakfast rush.  We had time to have a champagne mint cocktail - the Champagne Supernova - for him, and a bloody mary for her.    I've got to mention the music here - this was better club music than Tao nightclub the night before, I'm not even joking.  What better way to wake up in Vegas than to get some coffee then head on out here and let the generous portions and great dance music give you energy for the day.  And generous portions they were, although I had the sundried tomato, feta, spinach, and basil scramble with crispy fried potatoes, buttermilk biscuit, and watermelon, which was one of their smallest dishes.  The scramble was done just right, just an amazing blend of flavors.  Potatoes were done just right, and the rosemary sprig in the biscuit gave it just the right hint of rosemary without it being overwhelming in every bite.  They have a mister and a fan for the outdoor seating so you can either cool off or have your own wet t-shirt contest outside, depending on your particular level of inhibition at the time . . . .  I could go on about this place, but it's made it to the top of my breakfast pantheon.  A MUST visit if you're in Vegas.  THANK YOU, fellow Yelpers, and the Man v. Food episode on them, for inspiring us to go there.  Did I mention the prices are very reasonable, especially for the quantity of food?  I might never eat breakfast out in the Bay Area again, save my $ for a trip to Vegas, and spend it on airfare and brunch here.  It's that good.  Bay Area breakfast places, visit and take note of the food, the vibe, everything.",

I ordered the BBQ ribs which which came out on a big, giant plate with mashed potatoes covering most of the plate and some green beans & carrots as garnish.  The ribs were placed on top of the potatoes, but the ribs barely had any BBQ sauce on them.  Even worse, the ribs were hard to cut, chewy, and were flavourless.  I only ate one rib and that was enough.  Didn't even want to take the leftovers home.    My wife ordered the signature fried chicken & waffles, and since the portions were so big, I helped her eat her meal, or I would have gone hungry for the rest of the night.  Our kids ordered the meatloaf which was pretty tasty.  A decent offering of kids menu choices.  Service was good, drinks refilled without even asking.    Bottom line, if you just want a lot of food and don't care about flavours, it's your place to be.",

    "text": "I didn't realize this restaurant had been featured on tv when I first visited; a friend from San Diego suggested I try one of the LV locations of his favorite SD hangout when I said I'd be here for a trade show. I'm sure glad I followed through on that suggestion! I had a wonderful dining experience. Excellent service, excellent food, excellent prices. I will definitely go back to any HH location, and recommend any of them without hesitation, just as my friend did.  The morning I visited, the restaurant was quite busy, but the amazing hostess quickly got us seated in a nice booth, and our coffee was brought out promptly. I instantly fell in love with the fun and funky ambiance and the quirky, tatted waitstaff. Our waitress was as fantastic as her tattoos. She was fun, friendly, and so on top of it that we were the ones that had to ask her to wait - we needed some extra time to absorb the incredible menu.   I had a very difficult time deciding, so since my friend had suggested the Sage Fried Chicken Egg Benedict ($15), that's what ended up ordering. I had been warned the portions were big, but until you see it with your own eyes, you cannot believe how gargantuan they truly are. A massive tower of sage fried chicken with fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, tomato, grilled mozzarella, chipotle cream and eggs was deposited in front of me, and I actually gasped out loud, to the amusement of my waitress. Though I instantly realized there was no way I was going to be able to consume all of this feast and still have a functioning heartbeat, I happily gave it a try.   It was an incredible breakfast. Every delicious ingredient tasted farm fresh, hand-prepared, and it was all perfectly cooked and seasoned. And it all tasted ... original! And different! And good! You can tell they make everything from scratch, because it tastes like it. Heck they even have house-made jam on the table... how awesome is that..??  My dining companion had the Meatloaf Hash, which was a huge portion of amazing hash adorned with roasted red peppers, fresh spinach, smoked mozzarella, and 2 perfectly cooked eggs. Rounding out this monster breakfast was a side of crispy potatoes, fruit and biscuit ($13).  Everything on this plate was also exceptionally flavorful and cooked very well.  I've been to other restaurants famous for large portions, but their food always tastes like \"chain\" food, and you can never count on the service because of how busy the restaurant is. Not so with Hash House. These breakfasts are obviously individually prepared with great care and attention to detail, freshness and flavor, and they're served with pride and panache by a very well-trained staff. Every aspect of my breakfast, from the first cup of coffee to the last bite of fruit, was wonderful. I cannot think of one single aspect I would change about this restaurant, the staff, or the food. It was absolutely perfect.  While a person couldn't (and shouldn't) eat a big breakfast or lunch like this all the time, occasionally enjoying one this tasty is a nice treat, especially if you're from out of town. So just like my friend urged me, I urge you to visit any Hash House location and give it a try. I'm sure you'll find, as I did, that you'll be very happy with the service, the prices, and most importantly, the wonderful food.  NOTE:  Apparently, if you have Twitter and you tweet you're @HashHouseLV,  you get a free drink!",

Good thing we decided to go elsewhere because if I waited 1.5 hours to eat Hash House, I would have been even more upset.  The second time I came back, we were seated within 15 minutes.  Outside, you see pictures of celebrities that have eaten at Hash House.  The main reason I decided to visit Hash House was because of the raving reviews Adam Richman gave on Man vs. Food.  Adam, your credibility is seriously on thin ice with me after my experience here.  Hash House is located inside the Imperial Palace hotel along the strip.  Is it just me or does this place feel cold and unclean?    Service here was also iffy.  It took our waitress a while for her to come over and take our drink orders and the restaurant wasn't even full.  She also disappeared at the end of our meal after she dropped off our check.  Then, she charged us an extra $2.50 for a split plate!  Ridiculous.  If I could give a negative star on service, I would.  Hash House is all presentation.  Their dishes come out looking massive!  Andrew D. and I ordered the chicken eggs benedict and I was SERIOUSLY disappointed.  Eggs benedict is my FAVORITE breakfast meal, but the dish SERIOUSLY lacked flavor and kick.  I was waiting for my taste buds to be stimulated, but alas, it was bland.  I ended up having to season the thing to the best of my ability with the tabasco sauce, ketchup and black peppers we had at the table.  Our whole group left feeling unsatisfied and a little bitter for having to waste our money on this place.  IIII felt bad also for making the group come back not ONCE, but TWICE to give it a try.  Do yourself a favor and find another place to have breakfast at.  Hash House is all talk and no flavor.",

I usually don't eat meatloaf at home or anywhere else, but for some reason, I really enjoy Hash House A Go Go's meatloaf.  The place is usually always hopping, so expect large crowds and loud ambiance.  The food portions are HUGE, so bring an appetite or be prepared to bring home lots of food!  I definitely recommend Hash House A Go Go for anyone looking to eat a hearty meal with their friends and family!",

We were served by Monce (sp.) She was amazing! The food was fantastic. I ordered the chilaquiles. After a disappointing chilaquile  experience at another restaurant a few days prior, our server assured us these were different and boy was she right. My husband had the chorizo skillet and by the looks of his cleaned plate it was delicious. My son wanted pancakes, this was his first visit. We told him we would order him just 1 pancake and he would see why! It was bigger than his head. We left full and happy and happy to have had supreme customer service!",

Scrambled eggs on the side. They were not over cooked and the quantity of eggs was very fair for an extra $1. All in all, a solid meal here.

I believed I can finish the plate..I came with big plans...I left  4pounds more and 2 from that was leftover food I clearly lost the battle but gained a great experience The opinions about hash house are very divided. Some says its great some says it is bland, I am team great. We arrived around 8.30, we were greeted and seated immediately. Our server was amazing, make sure we know beforehand that the portions are huge! Our food came out really fast and my personal opinion is that it tasted great. Nothing was overwhelming but every part of the dish was nicely seasoned and made a whole experience together. Ive tried the chicken waffles for the first time. The chicken was crispy, the waffles were fluffy and the fried leeks gave the final touch. It was delicious!  I also ordered tangerine juice what was also really nice and refreshing. Mark ordered the signature man vs food crispy chicken benedict what reminded me my grandmother signature Sunday lunch menu at home, really comforting, and the chipotle sauce is fantastic on the top. It is everything but bland. The only thing I didnt like so much was the biscuit but only because I have different view about how a biscuit should taste like since it is very different in the country where I came from.  Great place to come for celebrations when the whole family has be be fed with tasty food. You need 2 people to finish a dish so it is also great to share. Im really happy that I didnt let myself convinced that the food is not worth it here because it does. Now I am happily stay in bed for the rest of the day with my food baby and binge eating on the leftovers in the middle of the night",

We ordered tons of food and I believe the price is not worth it. I understand you're in Vegas so most of the prices will usually be a bit pricier, but to me... it's not worth it.  Waffles were soggy, chicken was flavorful on the outside, but dry on the inside. They serve big pieces and looks almost too delicious to eat; but once you dig in, it's definitely not what you expect.  I don't know if it was just that time that it was not great, but I really don't see myself coming back. I think I had really high hopes and ended up not meeting my expectations.  I do have to say, the workers were extremely friendly and they are on top of it, it just wasn't my cup of tea. I believe you definitely should check this place out yourself for your own experience because maybe they were just having an off day when I came.",

I have not gone to any of the Hash House a Go Go places because all I've ever heard is, \"The portions are huge.\"  \"It's more than one person can eat.\"  \"You'll need a take out box for sure!\"  Not wanting to eat like this, I have avoided the place.  Enter our Thanksgiving arranger.  How could I say no when there would be 11 other people there to help eat everything.  I'm glad the meal came about.  The arranger ordered for the table--2 orders of pumpkin cinnamon pancakes, 2 orders of cinnamon bread pudding, 2 orders each of their Thanksgiving turkey platters and their HUGE turkey pot pies served in what looked like a giant conch, and enough biscuits for everyone to share with someone sitting by them.  Service was excellent for our large party and all the food was tasty.  The pancake was so large it could have been something that someone with a bit of talent could have tossed like pizza dough it was so large.  My iced tea was not refilled but otherwise, service was good.  I might even come back alone sometime!",

Too many potatoes compared to meat to will fill you up.  Chicken and waffles enough for 2 people and still leftover. Always great flavor and presentation.   Kids French toast with eggs. My daughter who's picky, love it. Maybe sharable but is big for kids.  Will be back like always.",

My husband ordered the meatloaf sandwich with Mac and cheese.  Everything was fresh and delicious. Come hungry because the portions are huge. We asked for take home boxes because we couldn't finish our meals.  It's a little pricey but my husband received a free glass because he joined the over 55 club and I ordered a drink to fulfill the requirements for the glass. The glass is solid and heavy--very nice.

    "text": "Hash House A Go Go, you were more like Hash House A \"NO NO!\" We were visiting Vegas from out of town and a person in my group had heard fabulous things about this location, so we traveled a bit out the way to eat here and were extremely disappointed and underwhelmed.   For starters, why is it so dark in here? I could barely see my menu. Anywho, a couple of us ordered the popular chicken and waffles that our server raved about and when we received our orders they were covered with leeks, tomatoes, and peppers on the plate. We spent so much time getting rid of what seemed to look like \"hay\" off our plates, by the time we got to start eating, it was mainly cold. Our waffles came with bacon inside. It seemed like a good idea, I mean, it's bacon...what's not to like?! Instead of the bacon being chopped up into pieces in the batter, it was placed whole inside the waffle. Every time I cut my waffle, I had to struggle getting to the waffle because the entire strip would come out. It was just a completely messy dish that was difficult to eat and maneuver around. I don't like meals that I have to think strategically about before I make my move and start eating.   Not to mention, the chicken in both meals weren't completely done on the inside. The bright side of the visit was the drink I had, the Champagne Super Nova, it was really delicious. I also felt like the prices were over priced. Yes, they give you a very large quantity of food, that's all well and good, but if you don't actually enjoy the food, who cares about the quantity.   We gave it a try, wasn't a fan and now can cross it off our list of places never to return to in Vegas.",

Complimentary biscuits- Yum, so creamy... Spiked Lemonade- Wowza, I had two! Rosemary Chicken Strips- meh Chicken and Waffles- I know this dish is very popular but I'm just not into the chicken being paired with waffles, sorry.  Chicken Fried Steak- Do I really need to tell you what I thought? You guys know my love for this dish. Excellent!  The boys also ordered Apple Smoked Bacon w/ Mashed Potatoes Burger and Steak & Eggs. We were stuffed and just laughed when Rich asked if we wanted dessert. Next time, we know to share the dishes. Spent $200 for a party of 4 with tip included.",

The location, inside the Imperial Palace, was, well, icky. Even though we had a booth during the meal, I felt like the restaurant was grossly overcrowded, loud, and full of unruly kids.   I split the Sage Fried Chicken and waffles with my date. I'll admit that neither of us are chicken or waffle fans, but we were really, really hoping to be converted. And that just didn't happen. We got a HUGE plate of food and, between the two of us, did not manage to finish it. The chicken was dry and overseasoned and the waffle was VERY dry and the bacon it contained was overcooked. Time to drench the whole thing in syrup, right? Ehhh. Wrong. The syrup was of pretty poor quality and didn't do much.   Pluses: the biscuits were amazing and our server was sweet and quick with refills. I won't be back here if I revisit Vegas.",

It's the only non-all-you-can-eat restaurant that satisfies my appetite. The food is also very appealing to the eye. I had their roast chicken, and it had these very thin, crunchy garnishes on top of it. Even after I ate them I had no idea what they were so I asked the waiter. Turns out that they were deep-fried linguini strands. I never would have guessed that. I smile when I picture the look on first-timers' faces when they get their meals served to them on these humongous plates. I can only assume that they are happily surprised. I don't think I've ever seen meals that large on one plate. No one who has joined me for breakfast, lunch or dinner, has been able to finish their meal (and once I'm done with my plate, I cannot eat the remainder of any other plate). I've had most of their menu, but I'm most impressed with their chicken pot pie. The pastry easily reaches 6 inches above the plate. They're breakfast skillets are great, I've tasted their desserts and they're simply decadent.  The service is good. We've never had to wait to be seated, but they have a bar/waiting room which looks very bright and comfortable. The pictures that I've seen, show the pretty plating, but you really have to go there to fully appreciate the portion size.",

Generally speaking, I'm not a fan of Bloody Mary's. I think the idea of vodka mixed with tomato juice is down right nasty, but after watching Mary after Mary being whipped up behind the bar, I decided that I needed to try one of these amazing looking concoctions. Only problem was, it seriously took us about 15 minutes to grab the attention of a bartender. Not cool. I understand you're extremely busy, but 15 minutes? Absurdly long wait aside, it's served in a huge class and adorned with a variety of pickled veggies and it was hands down, the best Bloody Mary I'd ever had.  We did have a pretty long wait for a table (which I was ready for), because we came late Sunday morning and all the marathoners were slowly gathering in to pig out after their race. My bf ordered the fried chicken benedict that he had been craving since the airing of Man V Food, and I went with the sage fried chicken and waffles that were recommended by the NY Times. Now, I've never had chicken and waffles so I really had no idea what I was in for, and man was I surprised! Two strips of bacon were cooked inside of each waffle! And the fried chicken? Probably one of the best pieces of fried poultry I've ever consumed. The bf reported back that his benedict was everything he had been hoping for and more.   Next trip to Vegas, I'm definitely coming back...just maybe a little bit earlier so we don't have to wait an hour for a table and get ignored by the bartenders.",

    "text": "This place has got some delicious, original food and creative drinks, but our experience was really altered by the hour-and-a-half wait with nowhere to stand except a crowded bar where our party was divided and getting trampled, or the cold, desert winter air.  We arrived on a Sunday after a few friends had run in the Las Vegas marathon.  I didn't run, but had been up early to cheer on friends after a long night at the clubs, therefore, arriving tired and hung over.  We were all hungry, and it was getting too cold to wait outside, but as the place is filled with people waiting for food, they put tables throughout the bar, making almost no indoor waiting area, which is odd as Las Vegas weather is too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter to comfortably wait outside.  But, since we were there we waited....and waited.  Managing to finally maneuver to the bar, my friend got herself a Bloody Mary, which was impressive and looked more like a meal. When we did actually get a table, three different staff members asked if our whole party was there....kind of annoying to have to tell them three times that they were taking care of the bar tab and would be right over.  I really did enjoy the food...but such a long wait does work up an appetite.  I had the Salmon Benedict.  The portion was huge and it was colorful.  Really, I would have like a bit smaller portions, as I'm not sure whoever could finish these, as those who ran the marathon could not.  My friend had hot cocoa with marshmallows which was really cute. Now that they are opening a Hash House on the Strip at the Imperial Palace, I may go back....on a week day when the wait is shorter and so that we can wait in a comfortable hotel, drink in hand.",

If you're dumbfounded why the average cud chewing American women weighs 160lb (men probably put this number to shame), you can thank Hash House a Go Go because this place is all about SIZE. So if you're a size queen, then you'll want to get your big ole' booty down to the Hash House.... oh, and don't expect a Vegas style lounge with \"go go dancers\". It's just a breakfast joint with feed sack sized portions.  I prematurely ordered the chicken and eggs, and I should have read \"Karen Y's\" freak'n review cuz she got it right about the chicken being dry which brought out my \"O\" face! \"Ooooh, wtf! Why did I order the chicken because I can't stand dry overcooked chicken! The chicken was so dry I would have gladly taken some supermarket fried chicken over it any day. Even the side of chipotle sauce couldn't save this overcooked bird.  My other biggest pet peeve is to plate food with huge chunks of herbs if it's not intended to be eaten. Hash House is one of these perverse offenders because they serve up their dishes with a big ole' sprig of sage. Isn't that classy.  This place isn't just a total hog farm cuz even though the interior is awkwardly designed with angled steel/diamond plated elements blended with antique looking wood pieces, they do have some decent mashed potatoes and the bacon was decent. I just highly doubt I'll be going back for seconds..... I'm sure there's some heffers up for thirds.  I didn't see the Man vs. Food episode with Adam Richmond, but I'd just like him to know how it went down for me:  Cows 1 vs Greg 0",

The menu is great /w tons of breakfast options (although they do have lunch as well). I ordered the benedicts which came w/ a chipotle hollandaise AMAZING! The eggs were placed over a freshly baked biscuit which in its self was bomb. They make their own jam and to tell u the truth, i could have just ordered the biscuit and jam and i would have still given them 5 stars! Try the watermelon kiwi lemon aid  which is a tri colored fruity drink with a big watermelon wedge. They do have an outdoor dining patio which looked really nice . I recommend this spot for breakfast. Prices are good as well if you are on a budget. Stray from the strip and check this spot out!",

I picked at it for most of the drive home, ate it for dinner, and still had plenty left over for the next day.  That made the price a value.

The busboy asked me three times if he could clear my plate, while I was obviously still eating.  The volume on the music was so uneven that, for some songs, I could hardly hear my companion.

The evening started out with them forgetting the margarita I ordered even though the waiter asked me what flavor I wanted. By the time he came back to the table for me to ask him about it dinner was half way over. The shrimp appetizer arrived with no plates to eat it with, and the cornmeal breading fell off before you could eat it. The steaks my mother and I ordered were very over cooked and dry. Not only that but the food was only lukewarm almost cold by the time it arrived. They offered us two free desserts for the well cooked steaks and even the desserts were not very good. I've had better desserts at a fast food restaurant. We were a party of eight and all of us went home with shall we say buyers remorse. Breakfast my be a different story, but we will not be returning for dinner ever again.",

First, the service...Tiffany, our waitress, has great personality to match her beguiling eyes...and was on point throughout my pals and mine's breakfast. So many servers say \"no problem\" or something of it's ilk when you ask for something, a MAJOR pet peeve of mine. Tiffany was always positive saying, \"Abosutely\"...the food was as great as the waitress. I had the Boston Hash which has a crabcake served on top...the crabcake had a bunch of crab in it and was moist and tasty. there aren't a lot of breakfasts I can't finish...but this was one of them. BIg portion and well prepared. Well Done!!",

I would return just to have a pancake.  Yup, like everyone else .. the pancake (1) is HUGE.  But, they are also good.  I got to try the banana pancake.  It was cooked well, with a slight crispyness.    The coffee is better than the reviews here.  Our waiter was good, making sure that my coffee cup was full, answering our questions and making it a fun breakfast.  I split the \"tractor driver\" with my wife.  It wasn't as big as I was expecting from the reviews on yelp.  \"Farm food with a twist\"!",

We went to the Las Vegas restaurant, and needless to say we were very  disappointed.  My food was cold My mother asked for coffee, she was delivered coffee and creamer, no spoon I asked for butter for my wife and I, as the ran by she  waitress dropped a cup of butter that was almost empty, barely enough for a  1/2  of a biscuit.  Then to top it off I had bought a coupon from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FResraurant.com&s=678d05e97244e0ad8b7ac9ce2dc0a5b9111af31e0c1ff474e9035d4f4189474b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Resraurant.com</a>,  I failed to notice that that coupon said \"Dinner\" on it, the waitress said that she could not accept it.  She said that there was a different coupon for Breakfast and that I should have used that one.  I asked to talk to the manager, I explained the situation to the manager, she said sorry she could not honor the coupon that \"we lose money on those anyway\"  I found her response to be disturbing, you do not issue coupons to make money, you do it to draw new customers to your establishment.  Although the coupon error was my fault, I thought that maybe she would see fit to offer me some sort of discount, offer me the discount of the \"Breakfast\" coupon or something, you know the old \"the customer is always right\" adage, I have been to dozens of restaurants where they have taken expired coupons, etc, because they want to make the customer happy.  Apparently this manager did not see the need to make the customer feel better, just to make a buck.    I know that this customer will not be back and I will not recommend this place to anyone else either.",

We sat outside which was fine as it was 80 degrees and sunny outside and there's an umbrella over the table to shade us.  I started out with the Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade.  The drink looks awesome as the bottom half of the drink is green and the top half pink.  The drink had the perfect mix of sweetness and tartness and made a perfect compliment to the heavy food.  I decided to go with the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  The fried chicken was tasty and not dry.  You got 2 large chicken breasts along with 3-4 waffles which came pre-syruped and with bacon stuffed in the middle.  The waffles went well with the fried chicken but I wasn't too impressed with them.  Overall I was satisfied and the portions were beyond huge.  I also got to try some of the Pork Tenderloin Benedict which was tender and not overcooked even though the meat was pounded flat.  Our party had a great time here and I would definitely come back here on a future trip.",

By the time we were seated we were starving, but it was hard to get someone to take order as they were so busy. I had the farmhouse Benedict with pork tenderloin with fruit instead of potatoes, which was awful beyond words! It was a fried pork tenderloin still swimming in oil, with a sickly sweet creamy sauce on top, the only edible bit of the meal was the fruit. The portions are massive, enough to feed about 30 people, so if you care for quantity over quality then this is the place for you.",

Our experience this time with a party of eight including two kids sucked. They sat us at a booth that was too small for us.  The server took forever to take our orders and did not come back to our table until he brought the bill towards the end of our meal.  I had to ask different waiters for things that we needed such as napkins.  When we asked for a refill for the kids milk, he charged us $4 more and did not even fill up the kids cup, I was just so pissed off by that point I just wanted to leave.  I asked for a comment card and they wanted me to write on scrap paper, which is bull*#@.  They said that I can call a manager for me to talk to but he was taking forever and I did not want to wait, so I'll just let yelpers know that the service is horrible.",

Seems like the type of place that tries so hard to be non-conformist in their technique/service/menu that they end up coming accross as pretentious - which is laughable for a breakfast place.  i attempted to sub mashed potatoes for crispy potatoes and was told that there were no substitutions because it was a chef inspired menu.. HA!  if i am at Joel Robuchon or any place with a Michelin Star than i understand.. but this was silly.  all in all the food wasnt anything special unless you are impressed by large portions on average food ala claim jumper.

(this way my second visit and the first was to long for the level of hangover I was experiencing) after catching up on my las Vegas dish with a weekly. The group of five of us was sat... Loved the concept of the menu. Service was a tad slow but we were there in the midst of Sunday brunch. Found myself wavering between multiple items to finally deside on the \"Man vs food\" favorite involving fried chicken, scrambled eggs, spinach, cheese, mashed potatos, biskets  and chipoltle cream sauces... Yes, all on one plate! After enjoying what I  thought would be an exotic tangerine juice (tastes just like orange) the  train of food began to arrive.. After a look at a pancake the size of a  spare tire I realized I might be in over my head... My brunch that would  have fed myself along with a small country was laid in front of me large knife handle poking out like it was challenging me. The dish was not easy to eat but very tasty after finishing a tenth of the plate my belly was completely full! I would definately go back to this establishment. Maybe for a burger that can feed a family of 4....",

The only thing cool about it was the size and presentation. The hamburger was devoid of any flavor( hello where was Mr. Salt and mrs.pepper??) The mashed potato's, well we might have just eaten ground up cardboard:-(. Then we order the signature HH bloody Mary, once again huge disappointment I might as well have cracked open a can of tomato soup and put some ice in it. Told the waitress of our issues ( we did have some praise, my BBBLT was good and so were my children's flapjack and quesadillia) but kinda got nowhere with complaint. We were told the manager was checking on it and would be right by. Waited and waited then decided well guess nothing is going to be done. Waitress did a pretty good job of pretending we were invisible at this point. Well f**k it I guess, we walked out. Nothing was offered to be done other then a brush off \" well check on it!\" That does not work in my book at all. Having just moved out to Vegas and a steady stream of family and friends set to be constantly visiting, we are going to avoid this Establishment at all costs. I think I'm done with crap corporations running \" family restaurants\" because there are plenty of real family owned restaurants that truly care about the customers. I would have given a higher rating but being treated like crap was not cool. Bye bye hash house you will not be missed. oh p.s. the bathroom smelt like a sweaty after a hard gym workout  va-hena(ladies you know what I mean!!)

    "text": "Whew what a surprise. I'm in Vegas for a work trip and craving some breakfast at around 1pm and my friend suggests this place. We head on over wouldn't you know it, a stocked bar, friendly staff, and some BUMPN house music full up with a DJ.  (record stopping screech) say what?  Yep a DJ. I asked and every second Saturday they have a theme complete with accompanied music. This weeks happened to be the theme of the EDM festival next weekend.   So we sat down and ordered but not before I grabbed a BLT bloody mary in the souvenir glass that is in fact tilted. Crazy. I ordered the French Toast which could, EASILY, feed two hungry people. Holy portion sizes batman!!  And the food tasted very good! Fast and friendly service. This place is an A+",

    "text": "Came in for an early dinner since on was on this side of town. It was a Monday so the place was not busy.  I ordered the 16 oz bone in rib eye steak from my waitress and requested cheddar bacon mashed instead of the sweet potato mashed. After she left I realized she didn't ask me how I wanted my steak cooked ,so I got up and advised her by the kitchen. When my waitress returned she advised me they weren't going to charge me extra for the change order this time, but in the future it will be $4.95 extra. Overall the food was yummy - steak was cooked medium rare as requested, sides of carrots and asparagus were included and even slices of prosciutto were a added touch. The cheddar covered bacon mashed was delish and included two full size strips of bacon!   After completing my meal my waitress dropped the bill and and I reviewed it but she charged me the $4.95 extra charge for the Cheddar mashed - WTH? What was also disturbing was she didn't ask me if I wanted dessert. I advised her I wanted the banana cheesecake - It was huge but flat tasting. After a few bites I left the balance and advised the waitress. She said she would advise the chef but when she returned with my bill I was charged $2.75 for coffee which I didn't order.  I pointed this out to my waitress and she took the bill and readjusted the tab again.  In closing, the main entree didn't disappoint at this Hash A Go Go but the service from my rookie waitress was horrendous. She never did mention a word with the flat cheesecake!",

I've been coming here for 11 years now and have not only received the best service each and every time, but I have had the most delicious, exceptionally prepared food for breakfast I've ever been exposed to. This place has the best, THE BEST, food, of any place I've ever been willing to drop $50 bucks on. I'm not joking. I'm assuming that if the menu is the same at the Strip locations, it's the same, but I've been coming here without fail to spend about $600 bucks a year on the most delicious breakfast yummies I've ever had the chance to experience. When I come here, it's to basically nut in my pants while eating the best breakfast food ever created.  Biscuits are hand made daily. The jam is made by hand based on the fruits that are in season. The chicken is, no joke, the best you'll have, ever. Presentation is magnifico, towers of food, uncooked pasta and herbs garnished, ginormous plates. I've never had a *meh* or middle of the road entree here, and while the servers aren't looking to stalk me on FB as some people would prefer, they are professional and courteous.  I cannot say enough good things about HHAGG, and will always be a loyal customer of this particular establishment. As I said previously, F anyone in the A that says otherwise. Long and hard.",

Normally there's a pretty stead 45-60 minute wait for a table here, but we walked right in on Friday for brunch - maybe it was in the stars :)  Everything on the menu sounds delicious - I recommend the infamous Chicken & Waffles. You truly can't go wrong. The sage fried chicken is absolutely succulent, and they actually put large pieces of bacon inside the waffles. This will be one of the best meals of your life, hands down. It's fabulous.   The staff are super friendly and tell you up front that the servings are 'generous' which happens to be a gross understatement. The four of us at the table were ravenous and shared two plates, barely finishing them. They also don't have heat lamps in the kitchen, so when your order is hot and ready, it comes right to the table which is how it truly should be.   This will be my #1 destination for all visitors :)",

I ordered the Tractor Driver Combo and a flapjack with Snickers baked inside because I figured I was on vacation and I'd never eat that at home. The flapjack was delicious and I was able to eat most of it along with the sausage but alas, my eyes were too big for my stomach and I didn't have room for much of the scrambled eggs. My dining companion ordered Andy's Famous Sage Fried Chicken Breast which came with a gigantic biscuit, 2 eggs and bacon mashed potatoes. He loved it but was only able to eat about 60% of it and only one bite of that awesome-looking biscuit. Ordinarily I would have helped him but I had no room to even try it. We regretted that we couldn't take the leftovers home because we were traveling but will make a point to visit the Chicago location sometime soon!",

The Food...Very Generous Portions, Which could Easily Feed 2 People! We Ordered Biscuits & Gravy, Man Vs. Food Special, Chicken and Waffles, and I got the Spinach, Ham and Eggs (which was Fine for Me) As you can tell by the Pics I Posted, those are Very Large Portions, but also Very Delish! The Biscuits & Gravy was  a Little on the Heavy Side due to the Creamy Gravy, the Man Vs. Food Special was Out of this World...Not Quite sure what was under the Gravy, but it was Awesome! The Chicken and Waffles were Stacked like a Mini Tower, but Very Tasty as well! My Sister & My Nieces & Nephew All Loved this Place, and So Did I!  The Prices are a Little Pricey, but Well Worth it if you Saw the Serving Sizes Personally!   This Place Can Be a Hit or Miss, as I can see from the other Reviews....I Say Give it a Try, If you don't like it...at least you tried it, right? =)",

Our problem is that we never want to share one thing. There are too many good choices. We have been to hash house a dozen times at least over the last 6 or so years. It never disappoints. That isn't to say everything is perfect. Some menu items are definitely better than others.  On our most recent trip out. We noticed the new menus. Most of the same stuff but there were some new additions. One of which was the crab cake Benedict which my wife got. We have always loved the tried and True fried chicken benedict, but I must say this one may be better. I love them both. But if you like crabcakes, give it a try. Very good. I also got the French toast. See? We can't share one thing. While it was very good. It didn't have enough syrup. Not even close to enough. All they gave was what was already poured on the plate. I had to ask for more after half a piece. Also, I gotta say this is a perfect example of better things to get. The French Toast is good. But that's it, just good. If I had a sweet tooth that day I would recommend the brown sugar banana pancake over this. My sister in law got the pumpkin pancake, big disappointment. Could barely tell it was pumpkin. Mainly by the color, not the flavor.  All in all, hash house is great. Always fun and huge portions of good food.",

Update after 35 minutes and we had gotten our entrees already and began eating this guy walks over stating he was our server.  He served nothing at all.  Not one good item of drink.  He is not getting a tip from me at all.  There are only 4 occupied tables in the whole restaurant.  I can't believe this type of service.  Final update.   Server actually brought me a drink, however I didn't need it or ask for it cause he brought it when I was already done eating.  Sorry a little to late for that.  Server needs to find a new occupation.",

So we got sited, server went to us and said she'll be right with us after a few minutes. Alryt no problem.  Server went back to us and asked for drinks. Said our order and at that moment she changes her facial expression hand when we asked for water with lemon.   Didn't even bother asking us if we're ready to order. Told her anyways we're reading.  We loved the food so much, the portions are huge and the food is amazing. Ordered the famous chicken and waffles and red velvet pancakes with eggs and bacon. Ddnt even bother asking us if what pancake we want until i asked if we get to choose. She's to in hurry to get out of our table.  I must really say that everything goes down to customer service, seeing her by the drinks section talking to her co workers smiling but whenever she comes to our table her mood changes.   I want to try other foods from the menu but from this experience i might go to a different location.",

    "text": "AMBIANCE: 3 - The restaurant is huge with lots of seating. It is very well organized with a lot of space around every table. Also, there is usually a good amount of tourists inside. The decor is kinda hardcore-the metal and bolts on the wall make it look rock n' roll, always a nice touch.  SERVICE: 2 - Our server was funny and sweet. He was quick and attentive and got us what we wanted when we asked. There was only one problem, and it was a big pet peeve: the restaurant was not busy at all, and it really felt like he was rushing us.   First, he came with the bill before we asked for it--which I thought was fine at first. Maybe he was being considerate. But way, way before we were even done eating, he asked us if we needed boxes, and that really irritated me.   Look, not everyone stuffs food down their throats and licks the plates clean like savages *cough* really hungry men *cough*. We were in and out in less than 40 minutes for a huge meal that we weren't even done eating!   FOOD: 3 - I have been here a total of 3 times in the past six years, and I can say with certainty that the drinks are definitely a lot better than the food. That being said, the food also used to be a lot better than it is now.   Unfortunately for the food, when it WAS better, the drinks were STILL better! My favorite is the Kiwi Watermelon drink. And don't miss out on your twisted glass, it's a pretty nice glass!   I have had both Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. Both were in huge portions. I mean huge. But the taste was skating a little above average. The flavors didn't mesh as well as they used to..let's just say it's not my favorite brunch place. I do come back for the drinks, so don't be too sad, it's not a total loss!",

Got the kiwi -watermelon - lemonade. Really good and not overly sweet. Can taste each of the flavors.  Shared Andy's sage fried chicken with biscuits, mashed potatoes, and chipotle sauce and Andy's other version of chicken and waffles. Also, had the portobello sandwich. Waffles trump the biscuits x10. The biscuit version was too much. That fried chicken was dang good and moist. Finger licking good. The waffles with bacon inside.... Damnnnnn good. Add maple syrup, a bloody good day.   Portions are huge. A fatties' paradise.   Service, good.",

I had the sage chicken biscuit eggs chipotle sauce ensemble and it was phenomenal!! Decadent and Delicious. HUGE of course, but that worked out rather nicely when I ate my leftovers as a late lunch.    If you're a foodie like me this place is a MUST. Twisted Farm Food Ya'll!!",

In my True fashion, I typed in \"awesome brunch\" into the Yelp search bar and \"Hash House\" popped up. To be perfectly honest with you all, we choose this place based on the silly name. Any place with \"a Go Go\" at the end of it's title is right up my alley.   Not only was i impressed with the menu itself, but the portions are friggen huge! I tried the salmon hash, which was delicious and the corned beef hash. I prefer the corned beef and the GIANT slice of watermelon that comes out with your meal is pretty awesome too. So if you're in the mood for huge pile of awesome breakfast food, head to Hash House  P.S if you follow \"hashhouselv\" on twitter, you can score some free drinks. Enjoy!",

They are light, fluffy, and delicious, and they have bacon inside!  Amazing. My father-in-law also says that the bread pudding is incredible.    Service was friendly and prompt.

Food when he went here about 7-8 months ago and I told myself that the next time I'm in Vegas, I'm going here!  Well, I did, and it didn't disappoint in the slightest!  My wife and I ordered one pancake, which is basically the size of a manhole cover.  I really wish we hadn't ordered it because there was no way we were going to finish the dish that came next, the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  When the waitress brought the dish, we had people looking and even asking what the heck this thing was.  It was HUGE!  Fortunately, the actual size matched the size of its taste!  I can't say I've ever had fried chicken or chipotle sauce in the morning, but it was very good.  It was a great experience and will most likely become a long-standing tradition every time we visit Vegas!",

    "text": "I agree with the reviews that think this place is totally overrated. Having seen the San Diego version on the Food Network and hearing rave reviews from friends, I decided to finally give Hash House A-Go-Go on Sahara a try to have breakfast with my sister and her two little boys. If you are looking for a brunch place on Saturday where you can actually hear the person sitting next to you, not the place to go.   First, being 10:30am on a Saturday, there was a 30 minute wait for first available (inside or outside). There's minimal spots to sit inside so we had to wait out in the chill. When finally seated inside, a DJ was blasting Lady Gaga so loud, I couldn't hear what my five year old nephew sitting right next to me wanted to order. This \"club-esque\" music lasted most of the breakfast and was a very irritating. Maybe I missed the \"Saturday Brunch Party\" memo.  I split a decent $8.50 Bloody Mary with my sister that came with a green bean, stuffed olive, and sweet pickle. I ordered what I thought was the \"Warsaw Hash\" which was a Brunch special they had for $10.95. After waiting 25 minutes for our food, the portion was pretty sizeable and I ended up taking half of it home. The quality, however, was a little bland. There were big chunks of ground Turkey and pieces of bacon and melted cheese on potatoes. Nothing amazing. I did try my nephew's cinnamon french toast and that was pretty yummy.  Overall I found the place a mix of hipsters, hipster wannabes, and trendy yuppies looking for a place \"cool\" to eat at. The wait was long to sit, get our food, and get boxes and have the check paid. It took us an hour and fifty minutes to eat and get out. Definitely not a place for a relaxing breakfast.",

I like how it is located away from the Vegas strip and separated from all the madness.  I came here for lunch on a Sunday.  There was a wait time of around 15-20 minutes, but well worth the wait.  I wanted to order everything off the menu because it all looked good on paper.   I ordered the fried chicken served on top of bacon waffles, fried leeks to dress the dish, and maple syrup drizzled on top of this giant tower of goodness.  The tower of food was held together with a large steak knife stuck right in the middle of the piled up food.  I felt like I was pulling out the Excalibur sword from the stone when I took out that steak knife and was ready for action!  I demolished the dish with no mercy.  Was a fair fight, but I think the dish won because I was knocked out when I got back to my hotel room.  The food was great.  Chicken was tender.  Perfect amount of seasoning.  Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The bacon waffles was good too.  Didn't know putting bacon in waffles would go so well together.  Also the watermelon lemonade is a refreshing drink.  The servers were very nice and friendly.  Lively atmosphere environment. Staff outfits were pretty cool too because they were dressed in team sports apparel.   If you are in the Vegas neighborhood, Hash House A Go Go is an absolutely must visit destination for all food lovers.  Bon Appetit!",

I had the chorizo hash.. it's made with chorizo so you would think it would have been flavorful and spicy but nope just bland.. meh. I was also told I couldn't add anything into it to protect \"the recipe\".. you know, that bland, zero flavor chorizo recipe. we waited for the server for 10 mins before he came to greet us. got my order wrong then gave us the check before I was even finished eating! I have worked in food service and am usually understanding because I too have been in situations like this but no apology no sincerity no nothing, this place needs to get over itself and focus on the recipes they work so hard to protect.. first and very last time I'll be going to this place.. we should have just waited for Egg & I... it was the same wait time but we decided to go to hash hash because it was so highly recommended.",

They put the sausage gravy first because they name items according to the ingredient it has the most of.  That's what the server said anyway, so not sure it holds True for all their dishes.  It does on this one...  lots of sausage, lots of gravy.  The only caution I would give others is on the 3rd Saturday brunch, they have a live DJ and it's super loud inside.  Some may like it.  I was not a fan.  They always seem to be busy, so expect to wait.  It's worth it though.  The food is great and the portions are massive!",

Well, those are the kinds of plates they use here for just one person's order.  I ordered Andy's Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower drizzled with a hot maple reduction and fried leeks.  Wow.  Visually and taste-wise, this dish had it all.  Upon first sight of this tower, I was reminded of Richard Dreyfus in Close Encounters of the Third Kind when he built that mountain out of mashed potatoes.  The base was four huge waffles with bacon cooked into them.  Then came the fried chicken with a knife and spruce of something on top to hold the mountain together.  The maple reduction was drizzled all over the plate, and the fried leeks were surrounding the mountain.  This dish was really tasty.  It was a perfect balance between the sweet and savory.  The waffles were well prepared, and the bacon was tasty.  The chicken was crisp yet lightly fried and juicy.  And, as if the sweetness of the maple reduction and waffles and the savoriness of the fried chicken weren't enough, the crunchy leeks added another layer of texture and taste that caught me by surprise.  Take heed:  this was a LOT of food...but I ate it all!  And my friends and my server was great!",

I had steak and eggs - steak was typical and the eggs were soaked in the blood of the steak so that wasnt very good.  The biscuit was large as well...and very ok in taste.  The wife had buscuits and gravy - they lopped the eggs on top of everything else - again focusing on large presentation rather than taste",

Actually that should just show it may be all about the hype and not the food.....(and now this makes 1220)  Now, don't get me wrong...the food is pretty good.....I wouldn't call it a gourmet breakfast or anything, it's just not the best place I've been for breakfast food. The portions are HUGE, of course, that's what they are famous for.....you can more than likely share your entree with someone.   Service wasn't so great on the day we went......one of the people at our  table ordered fries, but they came back much later to tell him they had run out (how do you run out of fries?) anyways, they brought him an alternative and said they wouldn't charge anything, but low and behold, the imaginary fries were on the bill. Just kind of annoying, that's all.   I think it's fun to eat here at least once, but not make it your go-to breakfast place in Vegas (the egg and I might be a better option.... )",

Used to be great, but better stuff to be had without the wait.  Good Bloody Mary's though! But pass if you want good food.",

    "text": "This place is the very definition of a gut-buster.   Portions are so huge, it's ridiculous. There's no way you'll be able to finish everything on your plate, unless you stick with a side of toast. Even then, you'll probably end up with an entire loaf. I was drawn here because of Man V. Food, and ended up ordering the dish that Adam made famous: it's advertised as a \"farm benedict,\" but what benedict have you ever seen that included a mound of mashed potatoes? In addition to sage fried chicken, fresh spinach, smoked bacon, tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs? This thing isn't a benedict, it's a HOUSE! A very tasty house, as it turns out, but still. I have a pretty good appetite, but was finished only halfway through. My wife ordered the riddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup, and lest you think her portion was any smaller, you'd be wrong. Like I said, this place thrives on excess! The french toast was chewy and delicious, with a hint of vanilla, and the warm bananas were a divine accompaniment. It all paired perfectly well with smoky bacon. Again though, it was impossible to finish more than half. Because we were on the road, this sadly meant wasting some of that delicious food, as there wasn't really an opportunity to eat the leftovers later.   You've gotta love a place that sells a hangover dish called O'Hare Of The Dog: a 24 oz Budweiser in a bag with a side of bacon.  Classy? Nope. But fun? Absolutely.   No matter how hungry you are, you will leave Hash House A Go Go stuffed to the gills, vowing never to eat another bite of food again for the rest of your life.   And the next morning, you'll be yearning for a return visit...",

I ordered the Pork Benedict $14.95 (Crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin w/ market yellow tomato, spinach, bar b' que cream, topped w/ scrambled eggs) oh and I forgot, it was also piled high on biscuits and mashed potatoes - definitely not your traditional Benedict, but I loved every bit of it. I seriously had food coma after four bites so I recommend sharing if you're not a fat-ass.   I also got the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade $4.50, a very cute and tasty multi-colored drink with a huge piece of watermelon off to the side of the glass. It was nice to have something refreshing after consuming all those carbs. (And BTW, I had the intentions of visiting this place way before Adam from Man Vs. Food did. LOL, I felt like I had to put that in there).",

I had the corned beef hash over crispy potatoes, with 2 poached eggs. I had never had corned beef hash like this before! Rather than the ground and canned corned beef we're all used to, it was stringy pieces of actual corned beef! A shocking yet welcome sight after driving this far from the strip for breakfast. Flabbergasted, I tried a complete bite with some egg, beef, and potato. All the textures and flavors came together like some sort of breakfast Voltron in my mouth! No seasoning was necessary, and yes, mom, I cleaned my plate. A+ dish, without a doubt.  My only complaint are the prices. Breakfast for 2 ran me almost $50 here with tip, a little more that I care to spend, but at least portions are big. I recommend sharing your dishes. Who cares if you get charged $2.50, it'll save you about 10 bucks and you'll both be full.",

I got the goat cheese and sun dried tomato scrambler with crispy potatoes and biscuits and tried some of the chicken and waffle tower. All of these were pure baby trading status. Hands down, one of the best meals I have ever had. The goat cheese complemented the sweetness of the sun dried tomatoes perfectly in the scrambler. The biscuits were thick and doughy and extremely fresh. The waffles, probably accidental, had some bacon cooked into it and i don't care if it was a mistake or not it was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>.

The chipotle cream sauce used for the benedict seemed under seasoned.  Fresh spinach and tomatoes were used....so I'll give them a star for that.  We also had to wait well over an hour for seats....all this combined made for a lack luster eating experience.  On a positive note, the snicker's pancake that we ordered was fluffy and well honestly anything with peanuts and chocolate is a win...and the pancake is about the size of a small pizza.

The kitchen will not allow substitutions because it would change the flavor profile.\"   They serve chicken and waffles.  And pancakes.  And hamburgers.  Seriously.   \"Change the flavor profile\" with _this_ menu.  What colossal ego got put in charge of this place...  They have plain plastic bottles of ketchup on the table, but only have cucumber ranch dressing.  Drinks are good, and come in cool leaning glasses. But don't ask for blended ice; they only use the blender the kitchen.  Decor is stainless steel, bolts and suspension cables, but every dish has a sprig of rosemary.  Music is a strange blend of 80s pop, jazz and reggae.  Often distracting.  Very confused identity.  The food tastes good, and might be worth the price if you like eating leftovers. (The portions _are_ huge.)  It is definitely not worth being insulted and told what you can and cannot order.  Five stars for good flavor and big portions.  Negative three (and I'm being kind) for the attitude.",

As she began taking order she insulted my 10 year old step daughter stating she didn't look ten, immediately we asked for the Manger.  Chris the manager on duty actually stood behind us and watched everything transpire, we again requested to speak with the manager again, when another waitress( very sweet with tattoos) searched for him, when we realized that Chris the manager was right behind us we approached him, he refused to offer assistance when my fiance asked him if he was aware of the situation Chris then stated he was busy and that he didn't care and Merry Christmas.",

    "text": "Hash House a Go Go is one of those places you have to enjoy at least once out of the many trips you'll take to Vegas. You won't regret it. Hash House features American Farmhouse Food with a twist! Portions are huge and the combinations are creative. This place will get you eating outside of your comfort zone, and you'll be okay with it!  SAGE FRIED CHICKEN and BACON WAFFLES We had heard so much about the chicken and waffles, so the bf HAD to get it: Sage Fried Chicken stacked up high atop Hash House's famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction, and fried leeks. Remember that thing I mentioned about the portion sizes being huge?! Yeah, this is the perfect example. One look, and the bf knew he wouldn't be able to finish it by himself. Hah. Good thing I'm always available to pick up the slack. ;) BTW, it was phenomenal. I loved the bacon waffles!  BENEDICT Of course once I saw the word \"Benedict,\" I was already drawn in. But um... be warned, they don't serve \"traditional\" anything at Hash House a Go Go, so don't go in expecting \"traditional\" American Fare. I love to try new things, so I was real excited about their gourmet-sounding Benedict. I chose the HH original w/ smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, roasted red pepper cream, and two basted eggs. Like all Benedicts at HH, it was served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mash. It was excellent. I'm a huge fan of spinach and roasted red peppers, so this was totally right up my alley. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and all the flavors melded together very nicely. And even though I am the biggest fan of Hollandaise, this red pepper cream sauce was a nice complement.   BIG O'CRISPY HAND HAMMERED PORK TENDERLOIN SANDWICH This sandwich is almost as big as it's name! It's like a HUGE pork cutlet served in a whole wheat bun, with onion, pickles, and ketchup. It comes with a choice of side. Hungry people, search no further! This thing is HUGE. This is taking \"huge portion sizes\" to another level. You'll have to see it to believe it. As for the taste, it was good. Almost like any other good, tasty, crispy pork cutlet I've ever had. Just 10x bigger..  VERDICT Overall, if you order the \"right\" things, you won't be disappointed. And of the things I've eaten at Hash House a Go Go, I have yet to be dissatisfied. Try, try, try this place! Especially if you are a big eater, like me. ;)  Yelp 365 - #280/365",

    "text": "Living in Vegas for all these years, it was time to finally come here. They used to have a location at the M, but they closed down so we made the shlep across town in the hopes of experiencing a Vegas icon. Sunday lunch time and line was out the door with the promise of seating after a 45 minute wait. We waited in the car since there wasn't much wait seating. Ok, busy place is always a good sign of good food, right? Well, maybe it's more about the GINORMOUS portions. As you can already tell from the 2 stars, I was not at all impressed. However, I must give props to the friendly and cordial service we received from our server. Clientele that day was mostly tatted up hipster crowd with piercings and stretched out lobes. To each their own. We ordered a spicy Bloody Mary that was very good and perfect for a Sunday afternoon. We've been on a fried chicken & waffles kick as of late and eager to try the sage chicken & waffles. The pictures of it show a tower of chicken stacked high on a huge plate. We thought sharing this enormous entree would be the best option. We were amused at the nearby table of 3 petite diners, each having their own tower of chicken & waffles. How ambitious. We finally got ours and though the presentation looked impressive...it was a huge disappointment. The chicken was soggy and skin was wet and fatty. The overall flavor of the sage and rosemary mixed into the batter was awful. We both choked down a couple bites but hated it. The waffle was ok with the bacon cooked into it, but not enough the redeem this nasty dish. This was the only thing on the menu that made Hash House a remote possibility for us, but after this experience we will definitely not return.",

All of the food was below average and a mess of a glob/mush.

It's a nice drive off the strip.  $5 for a kiwi watermelon lemonade. Pricey but it was well worth it. You get a nice wedge of watermelon with it. Perfect if you're a little parched from the previous crazy night.  Warning! The portions here are massive. It's funny because when I first got seated, I walked by this huge table that were waiting for their tab. Two things I noticed was that everyone had a togo box in front of them. Second, everyone looked like they were sitting in that post-food coma stage mode (waiting to knock the f out!).  I had the fried chicken and waffles of course. I barely put a dent in this plate. Had to box up at least half of it. I don't know if it beats Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles but the amount of food sure was over whelming. Actually, everyone on my table did not finish their food, not even close. I felt like we were wasting so much food and that some poor kid in Mogadishu could've been feasting on our leftovers.  Unless you can chow down like no other, you might want to share a plate with someone rather than all order something individually. BTW, the flapjacks here are a size of an oldskool 99' Acura Integra GS-R stock rim.  It's a little pricey but you do get a lot. I say, try it out one time so you can at least say you have dined at this infamous spot. It doesn't seem like a diet friendly joint.",

It was so huge I think every table around me thought it was some sort of joke. But it was real and it was huge.  I plowed thru the thick suace and it had great flavor and large chunks of broccoli, mushroom, carrots, peas and other tasty treats. While it was not a True pot pie...it was delicious. Enuff food for 4. Lol. But give em a try...it to was well worth it. The only thing lacking was the service. The only thing they weren't lacking was portion sizes.

I had heard that the portions were huge and they didn't disappoint. It's never a problem getting a to go box but how about having a not so big of a serving and drop the price. I would be much happier with that.  I once had a Chicken fried in Texas and it was available in 2 serving sizes, large and Texas large.   At the HHAGG I went for the Eggs Benedict and they were absolutely delicious. My friend Mark Napolitano had the Corn Beef Hash. I tasted the CBH and it was rather good, needless to say that there was far too much.   Overall the HHAGG is a great sensory overload on a Sunday morning. Don't expect a quiet Sunday brunch reading the newspapers and relaxing, it's not going to happen.   Food: Clean, fresh and very tasty.   Decor: Rustic farmhouse full of hanging yard sale items. Lots of wood.   Parking: No problem.   Location: So easy to find.   Cost: Reasonable, good value, I left with breakfast for the following morning.   Is The Hash House A GoGo worth a return visit. Yes, just as soon as I've digested this breakfast .",

We had them take it back and all they did is flip it around and bring it back out. We asked the same rude manager to remove it and she complained about my service dog moving from under the table for a second WHEN OUR WAITOR WAS CALLING HIM AND PLAYING WITH HIM BECAUSE HE \"LOVES DOGS\" this location has gone so downhill.

Fun stuff.  Arriving at 10 am on Saturday was good -  not too long a line.  No reservations.  The presentation of the food was great.  They had very good coffee.  The portions were able to huge.  The biscuits and spinach omlette was good. But the potatoes were bland and lifeless.The sage chicken looked awesome but we didn't try any.  The skillet breakfast at Denny's is just as good or better.  Sorry!",

I went like \"where is the voice coming from!!??\"  Minus 1 star for the service because our server refilled the coffee for the table next to us but not US even though we looked at him like we WANT COFFEE!

We split the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower between two people based on the server's advice.  Service was excellent by the way.  The portion was definitely enough for us and should be enough for two people with regular appetites.  The bacon-stuffed waffle to me wasn't that special, but the syrup was very good.  If you have a craving for fried chicken and waffles, this is a great spot.  Prices are what you'd expect in a Vegas restaurant and splitting an entree brings it down.  Definitely worth checking out.",

The food on the other hand, while eccentric was not full of flavor like I expected.  I ordered a side salad with the cucumber dressing and my lettuce was warm...hmmmm.  Not good lol  Then my mom got the chicken and waffles.  Why so much food? my goodness.    Anyway, the chicken needed salt big time, it tasted like they didn't season the chicken or the flour, I didn't taste any sage.  The waffles were chewy too, eww.  My hubby got the salmon and garlic potatoes, the salmon was fishy and also had no seasoning.  My friend got the sage chicken and penne pasta with the mushroom sauce.  I have made better.  It was just underwhelming.  You think it would be good because of all the celebrity signed menus on the wall but I just wasn't impressed.  Sorry. lol",

    "text": "My husband and I went to this restaurant today (reviewing W.Sahara location only) because I have been dying for some good French toast since we moved here - I have been seriously missing Cracker Barrel!  So after checking out the reviews here on Yelp, we decided to give Hash House a try. And we are very glad we did, it was fantastic!  I love the inside of the place and the vibe: very diner-y and upbeat.  We were seated immediately even tho it was noon on a weekday.  The service was good, we had about 3 different people taking care of us.  I appreciate that when servers are busy and their fellow servers help them out instead of just leaving the patrons hanging.   Anyway, we both ordered the Tractor Driver combo with the Griddled French Toast, eggs, sausage and bacon.  Plus coffee of course.  We both ate almost everything on our huge plates.  So we had lunch there about 12:30 today, it's now almost 6:30 p.m. and neither of us is hungry yet.  Well worth the $13 or so per plate (which I think is perfectly reasonable).  The French Toast was the perfect consistency and I loved it.  Everything else was just as good! I was so-so on the coffee but I prefer my coffee to be weak.  My husband, who likes his coffee to be as strong as possible (when I think it tastes like dirt on the bottom of a used ash-tray, he's happy :)) enjoyed it very much, even asked what the brand is.  Also, other minor points deducted for having to ask (and then wait briefly) for more silverware and napkins, then extra syrup.  Would give a 4.5 stars if Yelp! would let me!  We will be back soon and I am very glad we went.  Highly recommend it!",

They could not even cook an egg properly and we had to send that back.   It also took quite a long time to get our food even though we ordered simple things.  My wife ordered eggs and I got the bread pudding.  The table next to us ordered chicken and they got their food before us.  Not sure how you take more time cooking an egg and heating up bread pudding and then messing up both so badly.  There are a lot better places for breakfast than this one.",

The JOHN GOODMAN-pre-weight loss-sized portions here are insane.  I always order the southern fried-chicken eggs benedict (the dish featured on Man V. Food).  It is rich, heavy, and comforting, just like Oprah.    Typically, be ready to wait when you come here. This place is no secret anymore.  The service has always been good, which is important for a restaurant that generally functions at capacity.    A good way to enjoy this spot is to sit in or at the bar where seats are first come/first served, and split an entree with a friend.  A better way though, is to just go nuts, order everything you're appetite desires, and schedule some time for a nap afterwards.",

    "text": "One of the rare spots I've experienced here in Vegas that totally reminded me of Hollywood/Los Angeles. Came here ona Sunday afternoon/Brunch and this place was Stuffed to the Rim! There was no line out the door but once I opened it, it was like New Year's Eve on the Vegas Strip! Well, it was nothing new to me as this is a common occurence in my  home town.   The hostess tells us that the wait was gonna be around 45min - 1hr. So, I squeezed my  way to the bar and ordered the infamous brunch beverage - Mimosa. About 10 minutes later, I was still thirsty, so I ordered a Tangerine Mimosa. I never tried this combination before and I must say it was Awesome! Finally, get seated, about 40 minutes later, and by  this time I practically  memorized half the menu.   Andy's Sage Fried Chicken..: Served on a Big plate, Stacked architecturally sound and I couldn't wait to have a bite! The chicken, bacon mashed potaotes, eggs, biscuit.. Everything just worked and was more than filling!  French Toast: Another Enormous dish! Extra Thick bread with galloping amounts of pecan maple syrup and pieces of banana. It wasn't Great but not Bad either.  Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade: Awesome combination and  came with a Fat slice of Watermelon as its garnish.  Considering the long wait, the Alright tasting food, the Claim Jumper sized portions and the Great drinks.. I can't say I'd be back for a second round. I can only vouch for the generosity of food and the beverages at most..",

I could suggest more syrup if the portion's that mondo then just a ramekin size of  syrup will not do it justest. The chicken part extremely moist not dry breading very light and falls off and the waffles had a nice texture maybe a suggestion of powdered sugar on top to make cool looking.   group had also fried green tomatoes witch was so dam good that had a chicken something mix on it. The mix was really good however my concern if your vegetarian well obiv not eating at this place that they should mention chicken part on menu maybe they did however I might of missed it but was really great.   The staff seemed to like there job our server was great even the busser's who brought out food where friendly. The server continually asked us if we needed re fills on drinks and seemed not to mind when we asked for coffee, she said let me check and I guessed made a new one with out seeming bothered or traumatized for making us some.   The music volume is kinda loud even for my taste, however service and food made up for it.   Professional staff that makes eating out fun..     Group of 4 guest $95 bill but large portions.",

Chicken was perfectly seasoned and juicy. Waffles had great tasting strips of bacon cooked inside. Service was beyond great. Our waiter Robert was super and gave us re fills on drinks even before we could ask for them. He even gave us to go cup soda refills when he brought us our check. It was a super way to start the day!

    "text": "Not impressed with their service at all. We were told the wait would be 20-25 minutes which was fine, it's a Sunday morning on Father's Day. The problem is that we've been waiting for 45 minutes and were not told when we arrived that guests with reservations would be seated first. We didn't even know you could make a reservation. When my friend went to the front desk about 20 minutes ago, a young woman said that our table was being set. It's now 20 minutes later and still no table. My friend went back to the desk to see what's going on and a manager told him \"I don't know who told you your table was going to be ready. They shouldn't have said that\". Well what kind of establishment doesn't inform their guest about seating policies. It would have made so much more sense to say \"You're on the list but I want you to know that when reservations come in you'll be moved down a spot\" but no, they didn't do that.",

It was pretty slow with not many people when I placed my order, so not sure how my order got messed up, but not a huge deal. When they asked how everyrhing looked I said that I asked for mashed potatoes for my side. A few minutes later they brought me a small plate of mashed potatoes that tasted like they had been sitting around for a while.  Aside from those two things, the food was good, the portions were huge my waitress was pretty nice.",

We went know after work at about 5pm.. Ordered two mushroom Swiss burgers and two fried chicken Eggs Benedict (their man VS food) the cooks today just didn't know how to season anything...  The burgers were bland...  The egg was scrambled rather than Eggs Benedict..  The chicken fried steak was overcooked and under seasoned..  The hollandaise sauce was great, but that was the only seasoned item on the plate...  The strawberry lemonade was shockingly warm.... The hostess was nice, but the waitress  didn't greet us and took others orders who came after us..  Not coming here anymore, for sure",

It was not packed or busy i think she thought she would not get good tips from us cuz we're asians and didnt give a shit about us but im a server too and i tip good if i had good service i get it some asian ppl are super cheap when they tip but treat us like that isn't fair. She did not deserve a penny from me but i ended up leaving her 5bux. Never ever will i go back or recommend to other people. She suck!",

A couple of things to know, be hungry when u go because they have the biggest portions ever. The food is amazing. They are known for their chicken and waffles. I'm not a fan of waffles (more on that in a minute) so our server Angie suggested their version of eggs Benedict. It's  a perfectly prepared fried chicken breast ( and I never eat fried food) on top of mashed potatoes, a biscuit, fresh spinach and bacon all topped with delicious creamy chipotle sauce. Not too spicy just enough. My wife had waffles which I've never liked in my life. I had a bite of hers; good thing waffles like these are hard to find. I'd be a waffle fan.  Our server, Angie was superb. You're experience will be enhanced if you are lucky to have her. Better yet, request her. It's packed on a Sunday morning yet she never made us feel like she needed to turn the table. This in spite of a packed waiting area and people spilling out into the outside waiting. She was so attentive, eye contact and for those moments she was at ur table made u feel like u were the only people there. Never waited for coffee refills, which btw I can only drink decaf was the best decaf ever. Only suggestion would be do offer decaf black tea. But don't let that stop u. And what's amazing is you can make reservations online 7 days a week, any daypart. We arrived at 11:30 for our reservations- no waiting right to a table. Do yourself a favor if you love quality prepared food and different kinds of offerings make the drive off the strip and visit. Ask for Angie. You won't regret it.",

I ordered the BBQ ribs, with mixed veggies and sweet potato fries.  The burger was good, rather thin patties, but plenty of flavor and fillings.  I liked the flavor of the BBQ ribs, and they were tender and meaty, but the rib-count was smaller than I was anticipating (5 or 6 max).  I liked the veggies as well (carrots and green beans), and the sweet potato fries were the highlight of the meal.  For the Vegas strip, it's a reasonably priced place, with plenty of comfort food options, and character.  They're open 24 hours, so it's a good place to stop after a night of drinking.  The Linq and immediately surrounding hotels only offer 1 hour of free parking, two hotels over, you can park free at the Venitian, but it is a ~10 minute walk.",

    "text": "I would recommend this place if you want burnt and tasteless food and horrible service.   Gave a one star because giving a ZERO was not an option  2nd visit with this business at this location and totally ignored the red flag with our first visit.   The first visit was 6 years ago, service was horrible, then as it was last night when we decided to give the food a try, because of bad service on the 1st visit we walked out and didn't eat however because this visit we had our mother and daughter with us we decided to give it a try this 2nd time.....What a BAD decision that was.   It took the server 20 minutes before she took our drink order and was rushing as she was rushing to take our food order as well I understand that it was a Saturday night and Saturday night in Las Vegas is busy however in my opinion she was rude and short.  As for the food that is another story. The cook must not like their job or may need help in the kitchen as the table next to us complained about their food being burnt and the lady had to send her burnt burger back. We thought that was unfortunate although we overheard all that was going on at the table nearby and walked out on our first attempt 6 years ago we still decided to stay and give it a try. Well we did and boy was that the worst decision, McDonalds next door would have been a better choice. My daughter's grilled chicken burger was burnt but she did not mention this to us until we were ready to leave and I asked her why she didn't finish her food.  As for the service, there wasn't any. My 66 year old mother asked where the restroom was and I told her to ask someone in which I witnessed her get ignored by 2 team members. She eventually found it on her own.",

I came here for breakfast and I ordered their famous chicken and waffles and it was so good, make you wanna slap your momma. The waffles were so huge and fluffy and stuffed with whole strips of bacon. Yep, you heard me, they stuff their waffles with bacon!!!! The chicken is well seasoned and very tender and juicy. Their portion sizes are huge too, so you'll be stuffed and you'll have some saved for later.  The atmosphere is pretty fun and they have an assortment of cocktails. They even take reservations now using Open Table. I loved this place so much, that I reserved a table for a staff dinner here tomorrow night.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch prior to going to the 2016 RiSe Lantern Festival this year. Thought to maybe stuff myself a bit more since I heard this place had huge portions. We arrived around 130P on a Saturday afternoon and was told we had to wait about 10 minutes. Honestly I was surprised at the wait time considering it was a weekend ! With a party of 5, we were sat a booth table fairly quick.   I had been wanting to try their Sage Fried Chicken so that's what I got. Fried chicken is stacked with bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and fried leeks. It sounded really good if it was made well. The chicken was a bit dry despite drenching with the maple caramel reduction but was nicely flavored. The leeks looked like fried old green onions than leeks (yes I know how leeks look like, no im not stupid lol) The waffle was the most disappointing part. Yeah its a \"great\" idea to stick a piece of bacon in it but man the waffle is soft. As my friend had said, probably used the same batter as pancake and didn't cook it enough. It was soft and heavy. Not light and crispy like what I think a waffle should be. So sad !   HH Famous Roasted Chicken Pot Pie upside down crust stuffed with house roasted chicken, red potatoes, veggies, and pan gravy served with mashed potatoes. My friend had gotten this. There was a huge \"sombrero\" like crust topped with the insides of a chicken pot pie. Overall it tasted nice, like a chicken pot pie but the crust definitely throws it off. Not the same flaky kind of crust I love to eat with a pot pie.   The Tractor Driver Combo Two Eggs w/ bacon sausage or potatoes with 1 HH signature flapjack. Make it a waffle or french toast for a buck. OH MAN ! this \"flapjack\" was huge ! it was larger than my friend's face who ordered it. It dwarfed the two eggs so easily. LOL   I tried the biscuit from my friend's hash. It was really good. Crispy outside. soft inside. It was served by their house strawberry jam. Pretty good. Wish the biscuit was more buttery or given some butter too. XD   Overall, like my friend said, \"no one needs to eat this much food\" LOL. But that's not the problem. After all these years of people speaking highly of this place, my order was really disappointing. I love a good waffle and that's the one they screwed up the most :( so sad...",

While we've gone here before and experienced broken drink glasses and extremely slow responses, tonight was the last straw. The hostess greeted us and we requested a booth. The restaurant was maybe 30% full, plenty of open booths, but she did not offer to seat us there. I assumed they didn't want to use certain sections. Keep in mind, the place was 70% empty. She didn't offer a drink of water or to look at a menu while we waited. No one working there did.  Other employees, another server and a bartender,  walked by where we were waiting. They actually seemed annoyed by our request.  It just seems like with all the competition for restaurants in Vegas,  somebody there would want to take our money. Or at least be happy someone walked in on a slow midweek evening.    This was the last thing we needed after the broken glass incident. We thought \"Let's give them one more chance. \" So while tonight wasn't the worst ever,  it pissed us off more because the attitudes were so bad.",

    "text": "We saw this  place on Man vs. Food and decided to seek it out on our next LV trip.  Needless to say, we were NOT disappointed with Hash House A Go Go.  I understand that there are some hotel versions of this closer to the Strip, but we trekked out to the original on Sahara Blvd. and it was well worth the drive.  We were seated within 30 mins. on a Saturday, we expected to wait longer, as this place is a magnet for locals and visitors alike - perhaps the Casino versions of the restaurant keep it down to a decent wait if you drive out to the original HHAGG.  Service - probably the only thing that wasn't stellar here.  I won't take a star off for that, but it could have just been when we were there - the servers seemed a little green and the hostess had about as much class as what you might see in a local trailer park, but I digress.   Now, on to the reason to eat at Hash House A Go Go - the food - OMG - some of the biggest portions I've ever seen and not just big but good big food.  I had the Indiana Favorites - Andy's Sage Fried Chicken w/maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon, mashed potatoes & biscuit.  And I ate every single thing on that plate - come hungry.  It was magnificent!  The chicken was tender and crunchy, drizzled with just enough maple reduction (i.e. syrup) to give it such a nice sweet taste to the the coating on the chicken.  More potatoes than you probably eat for a Thanksgiving dinner including 2nds and 3rds but I kept that fork moving through everything, savoring each bite and not wanting this food to end.  The biscuit - oh man- the biscuit - you have to have a biscuit - take an order of those to go...they're that good.  And the whole thing was around $15.  This is now a must visit spot on any trip to Vegas.  We may try the Casino version to compare, but if you are in town and hungry - give the gaming tables and Cicque shows a rest and grab a fork and napkin and dig in - you will  NOT be disappointed.  Save your workout for the next day.",

    "text": "Adam Richman you are an idiot for recommending this place.  I went in with high hopes as I like places with big portions and creative food. We were seated right away on a Friday night, but then sat for the next 20 minutes watching servers walk by when someone finally noticed us. I could tell the server knew we had been waiting a while when she noticed that we didn't even have water. She asked if we wanted to just order as no one had bothered to see if we wanted drinks. I ordered a coke and the chicken and waffles. After another 10 minutes we finally got our drinks. Another 5 minutes later they brought us biscuits which were big and looked good, but ended up being dry and kind of tasteless. They did bring the equivalent of about 1 pat of butter and a tiny bit of honey (imagine a McDonald's honey \"spread\" container). It just wasn't enough for four adults. Then after another pretty decent wait (our server came and reassured us twice that our food was coming up), the food came. I have to say that everyone's entree looked awesome. After we took photos, something I have never done at a restaurant, we dug in.....  My first bite made me gag a little bit. Imagine as a kid experimenting with the food in the door of the refrigerator: maple syrup, soy sauce, garlic powder, green onion? No matter how you combine these things they are not going to mesh well on a waffle with bacon. Ok, I understand the spin on chicken and waffles, but when this is your signature dish and it tastes like shit-something is wrong. The waffles were inedible-thick and doughy. The bacon was limp. The chicken was cold and dry. I basically just picked at the deep fried green onions and spaghetti noodles and took the 1/4\" thick breading off of the chicken and had some protein.   The other diners in our party didn't like their dish either; the pork cutlets. The bastards at HH even charged them $2.50 for splitting a meal that could have fed eight people. Needless to say, we didn't take any leftovers home.  One last warning for good measure: if you are sensitive to MSG, don't order the waffles. The soy sauce in the dish contains MSG. I get a huge headache when I have even little bit and this must have had lots.   I was totally disappointed with the whole experience. I would like to go back and try breakfast, but it was so bad I just can't stomach it.",

I have heard so much about the SD location and always see photos of the food in my FB news feed, so I guess I had higher expectations - or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.  Intimidated by the reviews of the portions, I decided to go with the house smoked salmon scramble (slightly healthier fare) instead of the infamous sage fried chicken/waffle combo.  Friends had the roasted chicken hash and the basic combo.  Each meal was served in a large skillet accompanied by a large, airy biscuit with a couple pieces of fruit.  Even though I wanted healthy, I couldn't help but wish for a saltier salmon scramble, a more buttery biscuit and mashed potatoes, a slice of pineapple that wasn't so sour...  The only thing that saved us all in the end were 2 pots of sausage gravy, strawberry jam, and Tabasco sauce.  Prices are expected -- $13-16 range -- very reasonable for the portions you get.  Next time, stick with the famous items.  And get extra gravy.  Service was great, no issues.  The lines for the hostess should be clearly marked, though -- people were lining up on 2 sides trying to put their reservations down, creating a bit of a mess in the small lobby.  Also - very little to no cell reception throughout the restaurant and much of the casino, so don't let your buddies wander off.",

Portions are maddeningly huge. I ordered the chicken porcini pasta, but because of the creamy richness,  I couldn't taste the signature flavor these mushrooms normally impart.   Brunch is so popular, but worth a try if you can wait about 1 hour or so.  My blueberry pecan pancake was delicious, albeit too loaded with filling. The potatoes are yummy and crispy, eggs and bacon/sausage are standard. The waffles in the chicken and waffles dish were a little dry, bready, and soggy--I prefer waffles on the side so they stay crisp.  They also put weird garnishes (like fried dry spaghetti strands) that don't really anything to the dish.  I will probably come back at some point since there are many good looking items on the menu and the servers have great attitudes despite the chaos on busy weekends.",

For all the criticisms, some deserved, others, well I guess we all have our bad days that we take out on undeserving others:  The corned beef hash doesn't come from a dog food can.  It's real corned beef shredded with potatoes.  My one complaint is they could dice up everything a little finer, it's hardly bite size like hash should be.  I mean with the portions and plate size you get a real Land of the Giants feel.    This place is a great start for a 10 mile (acid head) hike in Red Rocks.    Get off the strip, man.",

Last time I went, I had a Brown Sugar Banana pancake and it was so good.   I would also recommend going on Friday nights to have the Chicken and Waffles! Why Friday? Well, it has a special reduced price only on Friday, which runs about 12.95 and you could definitely share this with someone else. Two chicken breasts and 2 waffles (with bacon inside).   So if you want some good food for a medium price, don't hesitate and get down there and try it out.",

My biggest tip would be to share with another adult, the portion sizes are insane! each couple shared a plate and were still left with a significant amount of food.   We all ordered the fried chicken and waffles, and like many of the other reviews, the chicken was flavorful but a little disappointing. The breading was lightly fried and just falling completely off, it lacked the nice crunch that you want with fried food. This might be due to the chicken being skin on, but the waffle shined thru and made this dish a solid 4/5.",

Go for the chicken and waffles, you will not be disappointed, and may need a to go box.  This place is a must try and next time I'm in Vegas I'll swing through at least once or twice.

As we waited to order the boys went and got some drinks to start at the bar, which is super convenient and fast!   Our server was really friendly, she wore glasses and had short hair. She did a great job always communicating with us on everything. Check backs were prompt and she was just always helpful.   Serving size is HUGE. I didn't finish my plate for sure but I ordered the chicken and waffles and my boyfriend got the corned beef hash.  I've had chicken and waffles before and I think I didn't really enjoy it because of all the fried onions.. chicken was ok and waffle was ok. Both were lacking texture and taste? Both were kind on the soggy side instead of a crispy chicken and a fresh waffle you know?   Corned beef was pretty good. Their signature jam for their biscuit was good as well.   Don't really know if it would be my first place to go for brunch. It is super popular so it just might be my personal preference.",

Knowing that the portions are huge, my wife and I decided to share the mushroom hash with scrambled eggs and a biscuit ($14.50). The size of the portion did not disappoint. The big surprise was how delicious the scrambled egg was. Not sure what they do to make a scrambled egg taste that good but boy was it good. The mushroom hash and the biscuit were also tasty. I also got to taste my daughters French toast. Really really good. Good food, excellent service, fair prices-great value. Definitely will return here when I'm in the mood for a big breakfast.",

In fact, the four of us shared two meals and still had some leftover.  The only real complaint we had was that their \"twisted\" coffee mugs are so unstable (they are designed as leaning to the side) that it was a little concerning every time someone set one down.  They tipped precariously every time.  Honestly, I can't believe the company's lawyers let that one through.  Otherwise, we were quite satisfied with the food and service.",

    "text": "Hash House A Go Go is a Las Vegas staple I quite frankly haven't never been to in the 10+ years living here. This location was close to my wife's business so we decided to catch their Happy Hour which start at 3:00pm daily. Their appetizers start at $5 and beers at $3.    We decided to order one main entree and a couple of appetizers for our meal.   1. Chicken wings (with Teriyaki sauce) : the chicken wings taste like your standard teriyaki chicken wings and came with about 7-8 pieces from what I remember.  Nothing to write home to mom about. ***  2. Chicken tenders : these are made in-house but need to get out of the house. They were thick chunks of meat but the batter was soggy and didn't have much texture to it at all. It was placed on a bed of fries which tasted like it soaked up all the grease. *  3. Fried polenta : this was okay but also tasted like it soaked up a lot of oil from the fryer. I think they need to change the cooking temperature for their fried menu items because it seems to have a consistently oil soaked soggy texture / taste. **  4. Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict : this was probably the best thing we had there. The enormous portion made us full just looking at it. The only qualm I had with the dish was because of it's enormity, it was difficult to taste all the flavors of the dish in one bite. One bite might taste like the dry biscuit and chicken while another bite tastes like the egg and tomato. Breaking down the dish was also an ordeal but to each their own.  ****  The service was on point and the waiter and waitresses were friendly and attentive.   Overall it was an okay experience but probably would not return here. Just not my cup of tea. The portion sizes for one dish are big enough to feed a small family but I think it's more of a gimmick. Not a place to go for great tasting food but a place to visit once to say you've been there.",

    "text": "I thought that the staff here were friendly, attentive, and professional. However, I am not sure how to start this review.   I ordered the fried green tomatoes, the N.Y. steak, the bread pudding, and the beer in a bag.   The restaurant is very nice and clean. I loved the mix between barn and auto zone meets Denny's. Truly speaking, I think I wanted more after seeing the numerous reviews, but, in my mind I kept comparing this restaurant to a Denny's. The fried green tomatoes looked delicious. Yet, they were served with mayo on the side and the tomatoes were bland. I don't know that mayo was the right condiment. The tomatoes were firm and again, appeared to me as savory. Nonetheless, I went over them with the salt and pepper a few times.  Moments later my waiter, tall polite man with goatee and a radio voice, brought me a nice biscuit with a honey butter sauce. It was fantastic. So, I thought, forget about the bland tomatoes.   When my N.Y. steak came it looked amazing. There were so many goodies on the plate: roasted carrots, a roasted onion, green beans, asparagus, delicate onion rings, the steak, and more good stuff under my steak.   Well, the carrots were bland. The green beans and the asparagus were delicious and tender. But, the onion rings were bland too. However, I thought, ignore it and dig into the steak. Well, shoot! At this point, I recalled my nice waiter asking me if I wanted A1 steak sauce. You guessed it, the darn steak was bland too. I loved the roasted onion.   I honestly, never have a problem reaching for the salt shaker. But again, HHaGG (did I get this right?) seemed more like a Denny's. The food and the portions were bigger than life, but, so was the price. The bread pudding was good, the chocolate sauce was yummy.   The staff are amazing, but, the food reminded me of my favorite IHOP which I no longer visit due to same issues. I will return and try the breakfast, but, I honestly don't want to.",

My wife and I weren't super hungry so we often share plates and this was another one of those days.  My 3 kids ordered full plates and WOW, that's a lot of food!     None of the pictures in the menu truly represent the actual plates you get. In reality, you'll get a lot more.  The pancake was about 3/4\" thick and was closer to the size of a pizza.  The burger must have been close to 1 pound and the chicken and waffles should really labeled as \"a meal for two\".  I suppose if your a big eater you could finish one of these full meals, but I didn't even mention the complimentary biscuits yet!   You'll get some biscuits for the table that are the size of an apple and covered in a honey sauce.  Yummy!   We ended up ordering 4 dinner meals for 5 of us with two being 20's men and we still walked away with 3 take home boxes.    Great food.  Fair prices (after seeing the portions) and really pleasant servers.  We found a new \"must stop\" place for sure.    Enjoy!",

I had a cold brew iced coffee with added vanilla syrup as a beverage.  The husband ordered the double cheddar hamburger with a side salad and an iced tea.  Both plates were delicious and eye catching. Our server Jessica was bubbly, enthusiastic and engaging.  At 8:30am, there was no crowd or wait.  I suppose today being a Wednesday helped.

The quality of the food is very decent...not blow-your-mind amazing...but they get major points for originality, and their take on chicken and waffles is one of their must-tries, and for good reason. They also have a full bar and a large drink selection which includes espresso drinks and juices. On my last trip, I had the waffle Tractor Driver Combo while my friend ordered the Chicken Benedict. The waffle was fluffy and perfectly cooked as were the home fries on the side. The Chicken Benedict was even more impressive and might have outdone the chicken and waffles for me with its Chipotle hollandaise sauce. Only minor draw back was the bacon which I thought had a weird, funky aftertaste I could quite pinpoint. Otherwise, Hash House has a well-deserved place on the Las Vegas brunch circuit.",

    "text": "Super fatty, ginormous, American breakfast feast platters. How can you go wrong? You're already at the city of Sin, just add gluttony to the list of vices.  I've seen Hash House A Go Go on the FoodNetwork and have heard great things from friends, so I made it a point to check this place out, and of all days, the morning of my Las Vegas Marathon. I made sure I had enough protein, carbs, and starches in my system to keep me going for the long haul. Boy, did that plan come to fruition.  My family and I showed up around 10am and were seated shortly. We ended up getting the Sage Fried Chicken on top of the Spinach Scramble which also had Biscuits and Gravy. Somewhere in there were slabs of bacon and a whole bunch of country potatoes. zOMG!   I loved how, although the fried chicken was so large, it was juicy and tender and not at all dried out. The eggs were kind of overwhelming, but I love eggs. The biscuits were a little dense and dry, but the fatty and gluttonous gravy helped solve that issue. Every part of that platter was enjoyable. Three adults split that one entree and we barely cleaned it off.  Service was somewhat slow, as our server was conveniently missing in action, while we saw all the other servers zipping by constantly. The line to get a table was pretty long by the time we left. One grip [hence the 4 stars and not 5], was the fact that there was a $2.50 splitting fee. In encouraging each person to perform their own personal episode of Man vs Food, they've enforced a fee on top of splitting the food.  The one way you can waive that splitting fee is by ordering a side: a side of fruit, some bacon, biscuits, or even, yes you guessed it, a bowl of country gravy. We chose that ;D  Even the kids' meal sizes are large. Everything food related here is large! And tasty.   I will likely make this place a tradition - really like the food and can't wait to try all the other tasty items.  There is a parking lot out front and it seemed large enough to satisfy the customer base here.",

We sat in the bar area which had a tv and was separated from some larger groups in the main dining room.  As you can see if you check the menu, they have a wide variety of breakfast/brunch/lunch/dinner options. As it was just barely noon, I was expecting to go for a burger or something, but I was swayed by the lure of some legitimate corned beef hash.  The \"Hash\" options seem to be one of their signature items, as per their name. I went with the Corned Beef which had, obviously, some deliciously prepared corned beef (like, not chopped up pre-packaged frozen stuff - it was as if it had been slow-prepared that day), swiss cheese, red onions (but not too much). The kicker is that it was served over a large amount of delicious oven-fried potato chunks rather than standard hash browns, all in a large square skillet (see picture).  Oh, and it also came with 2 eggs any style, a buttermilk biscuit, and a couple fruit garnishes.  That all was around $13 I think, which might seem like a lot but as I said, it was outrageously proportioned. I didn't even touch the biscuit or the fruit, and it was still very filling.  The taste was great, and I'd recommend it to anyone.",

The presentation is a bit deceiving...you take a bite it's ok, but it progressively becomes a big fat disappointment. If you're really hungry and finish you're entire meal than get ready to feel too fat to do anything. The best thing here was the biscuit and jam. The place has some hope if they revamp the flavors of he dishes, use less oil/butter, and offer a lighter portion option.",

    "text": "\"So, have you guys been to Hash House A Go Go yet?\" asked the young woman at the front desk of the Marriott Grand Chateau timeshare where we were staying in Las Vegas.  (Good place, that Marriott property, but that's a different review.)   We told her that we'd heard of \"Hash House\" and the claim to fame for big portions which was not our thing - we'd rather have a little of something really good than a lot of something mediocre.  \"Ah\", she said, \"the food there IS really good.  But be SURE you split an order..\"  Since she, like my husband, was from Brooklyn and even grew up in the same neighborhood, he was inclined to take her advice.  (\"A girl from the neighborhood can't be wrong\" he said.)  We're' so glad we did because she was right on all counts.   Hash House a Go Go is a great place, the food is really good, and it's wise to split an order!  We stopped for breakfast at about 10:30 on a Wednesday morning.  The place was jumping and  we  had to wait ten minutes for a table. (A good sign at mid week in down economy, we think.)  A few minutes of wait gave us time to look around and we noted how inviting and sparkling clean everything was.  Also from \"meet and seat\" through \"order and eat\" the service was friendly and top notch.    The breakfast menu had lots of options, both more familiar and highly unique.  We opted for more familiar and split a bacon, avocado, cheese and egg scramble that came with delectable pan fried mashed potatoes, there's a novelty for breakfast, and a perfect buttermilk biscuit. Honest to goodness homemade strawberry jam was on the table...none of that \"individual serving container\" corn syrup laden stuff here!.   Breakfast was only about $12.00 and fed us both with more than we could eat.  (Well, OK, I probably could have finished off those great mashed potatoes but...)  If Hash House a Go Go were in our town we'd be regular customers for breakfast and lunch and dinner!  In our opinion, although very different experiences for sure, Hash House is tied with Bouchon at the Ventian for the best breakfast in Las Vegas!",

This dish was good when I had it last year but this time it was awful. The fried chicken was not crispy. The coating was soft & the chicken tasted undercooked. The waffles were just ok & the eggs were over easy & so runny they did not even seem cooked. Had to send them back. There was some kind of onion on top of the chicken that was so hard it did not even taste like real food. Had to take it all off & there was so much of it. My daughter had the same dish & also hated it. The waiter kept forgetting parts of our order had to wait a long time to get served even though the place was not busy. My husband had to send his eggs back as well & said his French toast was not good. His sausage was also undercooked. All in all it was an expensive meal that was just bad. Will not be going back.",

    "text": "Go to Hash House a Go Go if you crave enormous piles of low quality, deep-fried  ingredients served on huge plates.  The presentation of the food is ridiculous.  I believe the goal is to stack the food as high as possible and add a very large rosemary tree (not sprig, but tree) to the top for maximum height.  I saw many dishes being served to others.  If the entree didn't have a rosemary tree sticking out of the top, then it had a steak knife standing straight up from whatever it was stabbing.  Each entree measures about 8\"-11\" high.  I can't even begin to imagine what the calorie count is per dish.  Restaurants like this help me understand why we have an obesity problem in this country.  We ordered the salmon and chicken penne entrees.  The food was completely flavorless.  My salmon was served over a massive glob of potatoes (and adorned with a rosemary tree).  My husband's chicken was stacked on a skewer sticking into a half apple (and topped with a rosemary tree).  Our sodas had no bubbles.  They were like watery syrup.  We switched to water, which we have never done before.  The sodas were really that bad.  The music selection was odd and quite annoying - a slow, sad song, followed by a few head-banger tunes, back to slow, sad, then punk, and then a latin rhythm.  Just weird.  Service was fast but unfriendly.  $66 for two disgusting dinners.   We picked this place because of all the great reviews on yelp.  What a disappointment!  We ate there last night and both my husband and myself still feel sick this morning from the load of garbage still sitting in our stomachs.  I can't wait to take a shit.",

No joke, the pancake was bigger than my head. We seriously had 2 days worth of leftovers. The food was great, but left us wanting a tiny bit more. We liked the atmosphere and the funny thing is, the day we went, there were tons of celeb impersonators from Imperial Palace because they were announcing their new location at the Imperial Palace that day in a sort-of press conference. So it was extremely loud and the entertainers were performing the whole time we ate. That was a fun bonus for me :)  To drink, we had a mint mocha and a Smores mocha...both extremely yummy. I'll miss it when I move but I know it'll be successful enough to still be open anytime I visit :)",

But being the little pigs that we are, we still managed to order three full meals for the two of us.   We started off with the banana brown sugar pancake(enormous) with caramelized sugar on top. What a pancake , it was the size of a throw pillow filled with banana's. Delicious to look at and taste. Next meal for a family of four was the fried chicken benedict. This dish was layered with the following: potatoes home fried, buttermilk biscuits(two),raw spinach and tomatoes,four slices of bacon, giant boneless fried chicken breast (what a breast),three scrambled eggs, deep fried spears of spaghetti, fried cheese, chipolte sauce smothering it all. The plate of food was stacked so high it was a tower.   The third dish was the chicken and waffles, six waffles with the bacon cooked inside the waffle, then two enormous fried and boneless chicken breasts, topped with maple syrup, another towering inferno of calories. Everything was really delicious.   Service was actually pretty good since there were customers all over the place. It took 45 minutes to get a seat, then we ordered and the waitress said the food would be out in another 45 minutes. Surprisingly It didn't effect my mood, I was just giddy with anticipation of the GIANT meal we  would be partaking in. I can't wait to try the one in San Diego.",

Excellent drinks that match the size of their food - BIG.  Came here for brunch and it was fantastico!    I had the sage fried chicken and waffles with maple syrup reduction. My tastebuds were in overload my foodie friends. Imagine bacon strips cooked iNSIDE the waffles- yummy.  The the fried chicken was moist, flavorful and out of this world- and I'm not a fried chicken fan. Nevermind that I could not finish even half of it. My husband had the biscuits and sausage with gravy. That was heavenly with the sausage so tender and delish that you can't resist it. The biscuits did get a little hard after a bit but all is forgiven because of the gravy and eggs sitting in a beautiful cloudy fluff!  The drive off the strip for this place is worth while and the waiter/ bartender Randy is absolutly awesome!!  Place was packed but he made sure to check on us to see if we needed more drinks, update us on the wait for the food and if we needed anything else. Best bargain in town for what you get on your plate. Who needs the buffets in Vegas when you have hash house a go go!!! You must go my friends for a hip foodie experience that will leave your tastebuds in overdrive......",

    "text": "After going to bed around 6am and getting up at noon, and before hitting the road for the long drive back to LA Sunday afternoon, we decided to come here for brunch since our friend that lives there raved about it.  We had to speed there from our friend's house since they stop serving on Sundays at 2:30pm, but thankfully we made it in time.  They serve \"twisted farm food\" and plenty of it.  Their menu is filled with plenty of heavy meat, eggs and potato dishes.  The kind of food you want to eat a lot of and then take a nap.  They have various brunch food including hash dishes, scrambles, flapjacks, French toast, waffles, stuffed burgers, sandwiches, salads and benedicts, as well as a section titled \"Indiana Favorites\".  Being from Indiana, I knew I'd love this place once I saw that.  I decided on the \"Tractors Driver Combo\", which includes 2 eggs with bacon, sausage or potatoes and flapjacks, waffle or griddled French toast.  Since half the items on the menu feature bacon, I decided to get that as the side.  I had to get the griddled French toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup.  The eggs and bacon were good, but the star of the dish was definitely the French toast.  2 pieces of fluffy French toast with pecan maple syrup, whole pecans and a cooked banana sliced in half lengthwise.  Amazing.  Possibly the best French toast I've had.  Maybe not the best thing to eat before having to drive 5 hours since I just wanted to sleep afterwards, but worth it nonetheless.    A couple of interesting dishes on the brunch menu are the \"O'Hare of the dog\", which is a 24 ounce Budweiser with a side of bacon and the chicken and waffles, which unfortunately didn't look as good as chicken and waffles from Roscoe's in LA, but did include a full piece of bacon cooked into each waffle.  The atmosphere was very cool, kind of hip and kind of country, and the service was adequate.  The prices were reasonable, given that you get big plates of food.  I think our bill for 4 people came out to around $80 or so.  In addition to the great food, they were playing a very interesting mix of music.  From REM to Notorious B.I.G. to Sting to the Beatles to Gwen Stefani to Justin Timberlake to Elvis Costello.  Something for everyone I guess, but thankfully no country music.",

    "text": "We went yesterday morning for breakfast. The restaurant was about 1/3 full so we didn't think there would be any issues. Unfortunately, we were wrong. We placed our order with the waiter and my meal came out within 5 minutes with my husband's order no where in sight. My order was not only wrong but also cold.  We let the waiter know. During this he interrupted me multiple times and whisked my plate away. Round two of bad food and service: my husband's meal shows up. It's fine. Mine comes back. Cold again. Let the waiter know, again. More interrupting, more whisking away. The third time is the charm as my food comes out piping hot. But that was mostly because the kitchen staff put the plate in oven so it was too hot to touch. By the way, this is a kitchen trick to teach the customer a lesson. \"You want it hot? You'll get it hot!!\" The manager did comp both meals (not necessary as my husband's was fine). She handled the situation very well. Needless to say, one of our favorite restaurants has fallen to the bottom of our list. Won't be returning. Ever.",

This place has great food and service isnt bad . but they want to give you a small water not a large one .  because they expect the staff to refill all the time now anybody in the f and b knows you cant keep small glasses full when people are thursty. The MOST IMPORTTANT THING I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION IS THAT EVERY PLATE ON ARE TABLE WAS BROKEN AND CRACKS CHIPS SHOULD NEVER BEEN ON A PLATE I WOULD NEVER TAKE MY KIDS THEIR AGAIN DO TO THE LACK OF CONSURN FOR GUEST SAFTY .  side note i told the manager that the first plate i got was broken I dont know if he was being a smart ass by sending my food right after i talked to him about it . SO IF GOING TPO HASH HOUSE A GO GO BRING GLOVES JUST IN CASE",

(comes with 2 olives stuffed w/jalepenos, a pickle and a green bean.)  not sure if it's because they just aired the man vs food episode of this place or not, but it was hella crowded.  an hour wait on a sunday at 11am (but not to worry....have a bloody mary at the bar while you wait).  then another 30-45mins wait for the food.  at least the waitress warned us after taking our order, so that's good.  the menu scared me, so i ordered a simple scramble.  typical eggs scrambled with ham, spinach and cheese.  nothing special.  the banana french toast though.....fantastic!  about all the other food, check out the pics by the other yelpers.  massive portions at not-massive prices.  brunch for 6 was only $110 after tax+tip.",

    "text": "We went there this morning at 8am.  No wait.    The atmosphere is nice.  The music is a little loud and clubbish.  It seriously sounded like house music.  My 3 year old nephew kept \"fist-pumping\" to it.  It didn't bother me, but it did bother others in our group.  Waitress was okay.  I ordered a basic breakfast and wanted my scrambled eggs \"country scramble\".  Most waitresses/waitors know what this means- she didn't.  I told her I wanted fresh eggs cracked then scrambled.  None of that egg from the carton stuff for me.  She said \"oh, we can't do that\".  Fine, but I just kept wondering why?  They don't have fresh eggs?  They'd have to if you wanted a fried egg, right?  Food came- eggs were good, while they were luke-warm(they got cold very fast so I don't think they were too hot to begin with).  They were also runny, which I do not like, so I only ate a few bites.  They were a little runny for all of us.   Pancakes were yummy and so were the potatoes.  Everyone liked their food.  It was good.  Was it worth $100 for 5 people.......not so sure about that.  I'm pretty sure we will not return for breakfast.  My husband would like to try their dinner though, so maybe we'd go back for that.  The waitress also go quite snooty when we asked her to split the bill.  Prior to being seated I asked if it was okay to split the bill and we were told yes, so I didn't think it would be a problem.  I guess it was for the waitress.  Overall I was not as pleased as I thought I'd be.    We eat at Egg Works a lot on Sunset and Eastern.  They have pretty big portions and they are cheaper, and very good.",

    "text": "One night of pure Vegas partying and you will be screaming for a Grade A brunch that will cure you of any sinful activities you've endured the night before.  This place is IT and will provide you the absolute best brunch in town.  Their proportions are ginormous no matter what you order so if you come with a friend, plan to split the plate or you'll be walking around the casinos with a handful of doggy bags. I ordered the HH Original Benedict which was one of MANY styles of benedict they offered on their menu. The red pepper cream sauce was a sensational twist to a brunch time classic while underneath was a heavenly pile of country style biscuits, fresh spinach, tomato, and crispy bacon. They definitely did not skimp out on anything.  The service was friendly and attentive and overall a great experience.  And though I mainly rate restaurants based on service and quality of food,  if you are going for the environment, you will most certainly be puzzled. This place is definitely confused on whether it wants to be a diner or a mod/urban themed restaurant. The music was laughable, jumping from 80's synth pop to 90's rock ballads to early techno and somewhat distracting.  I truly would have given this place 4 stars but there was one minor detail about the menu that left me a little bit disappointed... While they had an extensive brunch menu that was served through lunch, if you do not make it to sit down before they change their breakfast menu, all of their breakfast items are served with scrambled eggs only and the chefs WILL NOT cater to your preference of any other style eggs. That's right, if you are drooling over all those eggs benedict specialties, you will be served your biscuits with SCRAMBLED instead of poached how it's supposed to be. Bad move, HH, but great creativity with the other items on your menu.",

It took a long time to get drink refills, orders taken, and you know somebody f'd up when the manager brings out your breakfast, which has been sitting on the counter for 30 to 45 minutes.  I think the fried sage chicken and waffles would have been delicious, rather than average, if it had been warm, or if we could find somebody to get more maple syrup from.  The waffles, by the time they reached us, were dry and brittle, and the chicken was room temperature and soggy.  We couldn't find anybody to ask if we could somehow get our meal fixed, so we ate it glumly.  It's a huge portion, two of us couldn't finish it.  And it had such potential to be good, there are good flavors and creativity, but the crappy service made it just another lukewarm meal at a crowded place.  However, the coffee is good, I asked what kind it was, and the waitress said she would find out and get back to me.  Given the service issues, is it surprising she never came back?  I may give this place another go-go, but only if I can sit where the real diners are allowed.",

I like to eat, so I also got the bacon, avacado, onion, & swiss scramble. The scramble was made out of, at least 3 or 4 eggs, and came with a large portion of potato chuncks & a huge (and heavy) biscuit.  Note, I was unable to finish all the food I ordered. I think I probably could have eaten it for at least 2 other meals.

Their farm food with a twist is more like farm food is twisted. Ever go to a pancake house and order a stack or even a short stack. Uncle buck would be impressed by their one pancake. Mmmm I had the Pineapple and coconut one. Yum....I've had the corned beef hash there, the chicken and waffles. Ok it's not Roscoe's, but when waffles have bacon sticking out of them....FUN.  I defnitely like the presentation. It's the size of a sushi boat.  I've also had the the Chicken pot pie. Technically I like chicken pot pie as a pie. Not as an upside down pie crust hat with ladles of chicken pot pie innards and a mound of mashed potatoes.  I definitely liked the Flattened piece of fried pork goodness. Hmmm I wish they had rice....You can't give a filipino pork without rice.... Overall the food is good. Just insultingly large. It makes buffets look like 1 trip.  Cocktails inventive.....Bloody Mary with pickled green beans?  NICE! Coffee drinks....just order the coffee with the smore's goodness on there..... Budgetwise - it's reasonable for the amount of food you get. Ok does Idaho have potato shortages from this place. Yea too many little fried spaghetti thingies and those damn leeks. SAVE THE FRIED LEEKS!",

    "text": "Huge freakin' portions! Damn... it's one of the few places that I was challenged to finish all of my plate! I usually have no trouble knocking off \"large\" plates, but this one was definitely a challenge... The steak I had was a good 24 oz. and all the side dishes were enough to feed the starving children in Africa, and then some. I saw so many people sitting around our table, just in awe of the portions that were being served at their (and others') tables... Aside from the huge portions, the variety of dishes here were surprisingly nice. They even offer breakfast dishes during dinner hours, so that's a plus for anyone that craves pancakes at 10pm... Beware of the pancakes though... they are about the size of a pizza, and enough to definitely make the hungriest of people full. So, if you enjoy large portions, and a challenge... or an opportunity to impress your friends by finishing off a freakin' cow-sized steak.... this is the place! The service was also quite nice here the few times I've eaten here... and parking has been no trouble as well... I'm not sure it's all that family-friendly though... the place is set up more like a trendy, late-night place for adults...",

I give it 4 out of 5 only because of it's location and the patio or lack thereof. I wish they had a real cool comfortable patio to enjoy. The service was also a bit off- like the servers disappear from time to time. But again, really good food and unique setting. Well done!",

I had to ask twice just for someone to finally get our order, c'mon \"twice?\"...I hope it was not cuzz we were Asians, cuzz most of the customers were white Anglo's...and I honestly did notice some white customers that came after us getting service before we got ours, and all the workers were white... no matter what race or color u are...U.S dollars comes in the color green, treat all customers the same ...",

We sat at the bar to expedite our experience, and were surprised when the couple next to us (who ordered after us) were served about 20 minutes before our food arrived! The staff was observant enough to detect our dismay, which was appreciated. However, the first guy tells us our food will be out in 2 minutes, that there are three tickets ahead of us. We counted 5 separate dishes leaving the kitchen before someone else tells us our food will be right out, there are two tickets ahead of us (about 10 minutes after the first guy said three). The coffee was dilute, which didn't help the waiting game. Creative atmostphere, and worth going to once just to say you've been there and can see for yourself what the hype is about. NOT worth waiting any amount of time in line for.",

I've been to Hash House a Go Go previously for a business dinner, but it was my husband's first time(and last, unfortunately).  I had the Blue Crab Cakes(which were very good) and my husband ordered the swordfish.  His swordfish was horribly undercooked, it was so rubbery it could not be cut with a knife, so he sent it back.  The second  piece was still undercooked in the center, but by this point, we really just wanted to get our check and go.  Our server let us know the chef would be buying our dessert for the problem with the swordfish.  My husband ordered the cheesecake.  Ten minutes later, we were told they were out of cheesecake.  I don't know if it was an off night in the kitchen or what, so we ordered the cobbler and then 10 minutes later, told it was going to be another 10 minutes while it was heated in the oven. The cobbler was fine, but we felt our dinner out was a huge let down.  We were extremely disappointed, my husband certainly will not give them another try and it's going to be a long time before I will go back.",

Moonwalker Michael was there, Black or White Michael, Jackson 5 afro Michael was there...you get the point. They played all of MJ's hits during brunch and it was a totally fun atmosphere.   On to the food...   When I see the words 'chicken' and 'waffles' on a menu I really don't need to look any further. What arrived was a jaw-dropping, head-turning architectural digest-worthy tower of juicy fried chicken and waffles. Also stunning was the corned beef hash which they served on a massive cast iron skillet and the mouth-stretching double cheese burger.   The food was all very good although the standouts for me were the fries (dipped in the maple glaze!), corned beef, and their bloody marys.",

Hash House a Go Go serves gigantic portions with its unique menu items, from Chicken and Waffles to elegant prepared Mahi Mahi with blue crab cake.  Hubby and others ordered the special for the night, which was the Chicken and Waffles for $12.95 compared to $18 something on other nights. When it came out, it was taller than me (sitting down, of course). I was very surprised that the chicken were 2 thick pieces of huge breast meat. The chicken was crispy and a little sweet from the glaze. I thought the batter may need a little bit more seasoning but still decent.  I ordered the Mahi Mahi with blue crab cake ($27). The presentation looked like I was at a fancy 5 stars restaurant; it was gorgeous. The taste was different but good enough for me to almost finished the entire entree. The dish started out with a bed of two mounds of mashed potatoes, then layered with with two pieces of Mahi Mahi and then the blue crab cake which was covered with the pesto sauce. It also came with a side of carrots.  Over all the experience was enjoyable because the entree were fun to look at and atmosphere was nice.  The service was great. We arrived here 30 minutes before closing, and still sat all seven us down with a friendly smile. They didn't rush or anything even though we felt bad.",

Someone got the pancakes which was the size of a large hubcap. I got the chicken and waffles which featured two chicken breast on top of FOUR bacon stuffed waffles (I know, crazy!). We also had a skillet dish that used a real skillet not a mini or skinny skillet. And finally meatloaf which could have a fed a family of four for days.  As far as taste this place had quality to go with the quantity. The drinks were equally good and generous.  Service was great and very friendly.  The only downside is the location. It's quite a trek from the strip, you definitely have to go there as a destination. It's not something that you can stumble upon.  I'll definitely go there if I ever am in the area.",

We decided to make the cab trip over from the strip(realistically about $35 with to and fees....damn taxi's... But Uber had a 2.8 surge so it probably would've been more). When I got here the wait was about 10 minutes as she told me over the phone and there was actually a place to SIT and wait. Our Server was Izzy! She was SUPERFANTABULOUS. So nice, pleasant, helpful and patient. There was a really annoying customer at the table across from us and she didn't get aggravated at all and served them with a smile. The rest of the staff was really nice in passing and helpful. Frequently asking if we needed anything and making sure everything was perfect. The food was also awesome! Although the taxi ride was more than the food, it was sooooooo worth it! Big kudos to Izzy!!!!!",

This past weekend we were in Vegas for a friend's wedding and were pleasantly surprised to find out the owners opened location in the City of Sin.   After taking a Zantac 75 pill, we headed over to the area to settle in and wait a good 45 minutes for a table for 2. Patience is key here friends; this location apparently has been on Man Vs Food (which I'm not familiar with) and some other food network shows.   I had the Watermelon Kiwi Cooler which was beautiful to behold and deliciously refreshing to drink!  I have a sensitive stomach so I decided to go easy and order the Blueberry Pecan Flapjacks with two bacon strips and eggs over easy. The pancake, as M put it, was bigger than his head! hehe...   Damn was that pancake good although I only finished about 20% of it. M had the Basic or Original Breakfast which consisted of eggs, bacon or ham and potatoes. Still GIGANTIC for a mere $8.95 price tag.   Our server was great if not a bit harried due to the overwhelming crowds due to a biker convention in town! I took my dear Flapjack to go and tore a few pieces off later to munch on before sending the remaining bits into the ye olde hotel room trashcan.   I would recommend going at least ONCE to check this place out. The decor is fun, the servers wearing great outfits and the food spot on. Yes, it is crowded and a bit crazy inside but the experience is worth it to see GIANT food.   This place also reminds me of a now defunct restaurant in New York called Royal Canadian Pancake House that I used to go to in the early early 90's... anyone remember or been there?   Anyways, go check it out!",

They absolutely loved it, and of course none of us could finish our meals.  I love the chicken and waffles, which is big enough for two people to split and have some left over to take home. My second favorite dish is the grilled cheese with avocado, each slice of bread is close to 2 inches thick, and that's amazing in my book.  The second best thing is the drink menu, which has all sorts of amazing drinks that are basically desserts in their own right- hot chocolate, flavored coffee and cappucinos, etc.  I don't drink alcohol, so it's always nice to see a drink menu with special items that I can actually enjoy.",

The service was great, and the food was awesome.  Plus, this place serves tasty bloody marys, and that's not nearly as common as I'd like it to be. I had the Andy's sage fried chicken benedict with the chipotle sauce on the side.  I don't think the dish needed the sauce at all.  It was flavorful enough without it.  The apple pancake was pretty amazing too.   The portion sizes are huge.  The benedict leftovers were enough for about 3 more meals, and the pancake was the size of a medium pizza.  I prefer smaller portions, but I get that that's kind of their thing there. I would give this place 5 stars, but my mashed potatoes came out a little on the cold side, and my eggs were overcooked.",

Food here is good, I wouldn't call it outstanding but you won't be disappointed. Prices may seem a little high, but with how much food you get it is actually not bad at all. 2 people can easily split 1 dish, unless you are really hungry. Serving the scrambles in an iron skillet is a pretty cool little gimmick. All in all a good breakfast and I would return here next time in Vegas.",

I looked around at the plates on the tables that people had in front of them and I couldn't believe it.  Big mountains of food all of them, crowned with foot long branches of rosemary and handfuls of dried pasta.  Blechhhhhh!  So we sat down and the server was very nice.  It took almost an hour for us to get our food, however.  \"We don't use heat lamps or microwaves!\" was her explanation for the wait.  What does that mean?    You don't cook your pancakes and eggs in the microwave?  I should hope not.  Judging by the wait, they were cooking with a magnifying glass and a sunbeam.  Anyways, I ordered a \"Benedict\".  What came out was cold and awful and not anything close to a benedict.  A pound of gluey, cold mashed potatoes (why?), 2 cold and unappetizing bricks of biscuits topped with cold, unseasoned scrambled eggs!  I thought I got the wrong dish.  Nope, said young waitron.  That's our benedict!  I don't care what you call it, if it's supposed to be eggs benedict it's got to at least have poached eggs or even fried, not scrambled.  The worst part of it (besides the prices) was the mashed potato monstrosity!  Literally 2 pounds of cold, congealed potatoes that had already set up like a concrete foundation underneath all of the awful food.  I was angry leaving this restaurant I was so upset.  Waited an hour for a $15 plate of something I didn't order.  It tasted awful and made me sick to look at it it was so gross.  The pancake was just as bad, like 2 feet wide on top of a huge plate.  Disgusting.  And almost 50 bucks for breakfast?   Wow the portions are huge!  But the food sucks and it's super expensive.  You're really paying for two meals and who wants to bring eggs and pancake leftovers home?  We barely touched the food once it finally arrived and were obviously perturbed, but the waitress didn't notice or was used to it.  I couldn't wait to purge on yelp when I got home still starving in spite of the mound of mash.  I'm surprised this place gets such good yelps.  I really hated every inch of this strange place.",

Low point was the hostess telling my friend and I one night that we couldn't be seated (at midnight) because our entire party wasn't present (we were waiting for his girlfriend who was lagging behind 10-15 mins).  The restaurant is mostly empty, and the girl just stares at us and says \"policy.\"  GFY.  We walk.  In terms of the food, the portions are monsters.  The hashes aren't bad, but non traditional. The fresh squeezed OJ is tops.  The ahi-tuna sandwich also pretty good.  If anything, I'd sacrifice portion size for more pleasant service, and less of a loud atmosphere.  can be a sh$t show in there some days.  Would like some more down home cooking options that aren't sandwiches and hash which is 98% of the menu.",

    "text": "I went with three friends to Hash House a Go Go on Sunday.  First we were told that the wait for 4 was no more than 20 minutes.  1 hour later I had to check on our reservation and was told three more people ahead of us.  FINALLY we were seated and ordered.  This is where the disaster started to get worse.    My friend ordered the Waffles and Chicken and a pumpkin pancake and the rest of us ordered the Tractor.  The waffles and chicken arrive with a LONG BLACK HAIR in the food.  We sent it back and by this time lost our appetites.  One person who told us was the manager came over and apologized and did not offer to do anything.  We proceed through our meal and I have to say the pancakes were heavy dough and no taste.  When the bill arrived guess what the waffles and chicken and pumpkin pancake still on the bill.  We call over the \"so called Manager\" who told us she would have to get the Manager.  Lailani came over and said they just forgot to take it off the bill and would fix it.  Then we see the pumpkin pancake is still on there.  We asked why we were not compensated for that since it was part of the meal with the hair in it.  She said they do not give any compensation for food sent back and had a very arrogant attitude. She said corporate does not allow them to even offer a complimentary dessert or drink for any errors.  I don't think a HAIR in the food any just an \"error.\"     We said that the staff did not have their hair covered in the kitchen and she was arguing with us and we had full view of the cooks behind the counter.  We then asked how we could reach the corporate office and who was the owner and \"she didn't know\"  she was argumentative, rude and condescending.  I am in the food and beverage industry and if I treated my customers with the disrespect that Lailani did I am sure I would not have a job.    Two of the three people with me were from out of town and we wanted to have a nice relaxing brunch which turned into a nightmare of an experience.  On the way out we asked who owned the restaurant and how to reach them and the hostess seemed to have full knowledge on how we could reach the person to file a complaint.  A complaint was filed on Monday with corporate but to date nothing received.  This restaurant needs to train their managers in customer server and respect for the customer.  LAILANI is the worst manager I have ever met.  Needless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant.",

So...upon arriving, the host said it would take about 35 min...but it took over an hour for them to seat us, even after asking him 4 times what was taking so long.  Not good.  Finally we got to our seats, and I already knew what to order, since I did some research before going.  I ordered the Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict.  I think almost all of our group ordered it too.  The waiter even said that was his favorite thing, and that we all made a great choice.  It took a long time for the food to arrive, but when it did, it looked amazing.  Almost like a piece of art.  We've all seen the pics.  The only problem is IT HAD NO FLAVOR!!!!!!  Everything tasted the same...the chicken tasted like the eggs, the biscuit tasted like the chipotle sauce...there was no flavor at all...I'm a big guy who loves his food, but I probably had 4 bites before I just gave up hoping that the next bite was going to make it all better...it just wasn't gonna happen.  So...maybe I was just overhyping it in my own mind...or it just really wasn't that good...or maybe I just went on a bad day...but it really wasn't good...I wouldn't waste my time if I were you...",

Awesome drink list and my favorite was the bud heavy in a bag. Get the sage chicken even though you might think it's too heavy (it's not). My personal tip is do not order the bloody mary with stone ale. My girlfriend made the mistake of thinking it was topped with stone ale and it's exactly how the bartender explained it to her just in case, beer with non alcoholic bmary mix and she still ordered it and he still offered to get her another drink! Other big tip is that this is not on the strip and it's about 20 bucks just one way on the cab. If you want to stay on the strip go to the Imperial Palace for their other location.",

    "text": "The food itself is very good if you enjoy the all american southern type of food. I cannot complain about the food because it was large portions, well made, and very unique in itself. I got the corn beef hash and was barely able to finish it. It gives the complete satisfaction of being full.  The service however was absolutely awful. My friends and I came into Las Vegas hoping to visit this place for their breakfast. When we arrived we were seated and ordered from the menu. Right after our food was brought out the checks were brought with them. This is always troubling because when the checks are brought out right away then everyone is concerned about the cost of the meal and not enjoying themselves. It also means we can't order anything else if we want to since it's already been printed.  The next problem was how difficult it is to get water there. I'm not sure if it's a delicacy in the Hash House A Go Go, but the first time we asked the waiter was like \"I'll get that right away.\" He then comes out and starts taking orders from other tables. We then give him a second chance and ask again and he replies \"sorry, ill get that in a second.\" He comes out again without any water and is ready to collect the bill. We then beg him to please get water after all our meals are finished and he finally decides to to come out with the response \"the long awaited water.\" When I go to a restaurant I base my tip solely on how quick they are at refilling my water, how pleasant they are, and if they are checking on our table or not. If these are done I'll give 20-25% tip. It was hard to give a tip at this place because of how poor the service was.",

The wait wasn't as long as we were told ( we told 45 minutes to an hour) and were seated in about 20 minutes. Make no mistake, there were other people waiting for a table at around 1:00 p.m. on a Saturday, but the wait wasn't bad. Bring your appetite because just like other reviewers have said, the portions are HUGE. I suggest sharing or ordering something on the side and taking some from your fellow diners. Don't let the one pancake on your order fool you along with the sides: that one pancake alone almost covers an oval serving plate. I suggest the brown sugar and mango an coconut one. My brother ordered a blue cheese burger and he said it would it order again. However, it was big and the fries were nicely seasoned. The service was always good here and I have no complaints about it compared to other reviewers. My advice? Come here early on weekends and during the weekdays if you don't like to wait too long. Plenty of parking. Next time, I'm trying the burgers.",

    "text": "My friends and I decided to try this place out because we had seen it featured on TV.  Overall, we were pretty satisfied with the meal.  The biscuits and gravy were great.  My corned-beef hash dish came out a tad cold.  But the Hash House is really about quantity over quality, with portions ranging from large to HUGE.  Unfortunately, our entire experience was ruined by a group of douchebags sitting at a nearby table.  It was 10am, and they were clearly drunk, probably having gotten started the night before (It IS Vegas, after all).  They were incredibly loud and disruptive, dropping F-bombs, N-bombs (they were NOT African American, by the way), and other ethnic slurs just to make sure every race was covered.  All the while, the restaurant management did nothing.  We know for a fact that the manager on duty heard all the noise, because serving station was nearby and he actually brought us much of our food.  The wait staff, many of whom must have been insulted by the cussing and racist comments, said nothing.  Despite the fact that families with children, couples, and tables of mixed ethnicity were all sitting nearby, no one from the restaurant staff made any effort to ask these jerks to keep it down or to at least tone down their language.  Was it really up to us to confront these obnoxious people if we wanted to eat in peace?  Was the management going to just stand by and say nothing until someone made a stink about it?  I guess so...  They guys left before anyone confronted them, but the damage was done.  I think a restaurant owner or manager who truly cares about his/her customers would have done something about it rather than let 4 or 5 losers completely ruin a meal for the 20+ people around them.",

It's two big slices of great meatloaf with roasted tomatoes and smoked mozzarella on this great sliced and toasted up milk bread. The crab cake dinner is good too. I like crap cakes but they are always small so I thought I would get it here because I was sure the portion would be generous, boy was I right. Don't quotes me on this but I think they give you TWO six ounce crab cakes with mashers and all other kinds of stuff, I was stuffed and it was delicious.",

I had an omelette with sun dried tomatoes, goat cheese, and herbs. The dish was light, fluffy, flavorful and not greasy. They also offer a thoughtful children's' menu with some non-typical and traditional dishes for variety.   If the portions are too big go to McDonald's!

    "text": "I made the mistake of ordering my food without looking at other peoples' plates. I didn't notice the cyclopean heaps of steaming food on every table - I guess I was too wrapped up in conversation or something. But I doubt that as I rarely have much to say.  I decided on the mashed potato and bacon stuffed hamburger while my girlfriend went with the salmon and a large glass of tangerine juice - a particular favorite of hers and hard to find on many menus. Then a neighboring table received their order - pork chops. Looking past the gargantuan pile featured on the plate I saw that one side dish was an entire ear of corn. I began to panic.  Considering the amount of food served up, our orders came quickly and cheerfully from our server. Regret over my choice immediately consumed me and yet, I was excited by the prospect of attempting to consume approximately fourteen pounds of food in one sitting. The stack of my hamburger stood seven inches off the table's surface. I concluded right away that the fluffy bun on top could not be more than decoration, not intended to be consumed, like a garnish, and so it was discarded.  The menu stated crispy fries came with the burger. I was expecting thin, hard sticks of fried potato, but these fries were among the best I've ever had. Light and crispy on the outside, perfectly chewy on the inside with just enough grease to qualify as a french fry. It's too bad I couldn't finish them since the rest of the meal consisted of a two quarter-acre hamburger patties sandwiching a full liter of mashed potatoes.  It was easily the biggest hamburger I've ever seen that wasn't on TV trying to break a record. Knowing all too well that no human any smaller than Andre the Giant could pick this monstrosity up and take a bite out of it with their mere mortal mouth, Hash House supplied a huge steak knife stuck through the top of the so-called \"sandwich.\" I am more likely to call it what it is - a gastrointestinal assassin, a destroyer of mens' spirits. The taste of the thing should not be in question. I will leave flowery descriptions of its taste and color and texture and the subtle hints of.... whatever to the real foodie types of Yelp. I am here to relate the experience, that is all.  About 1/3 of the way into my behemoth of beef and bacon and mashed potatoes, the waitress asked how we were doing. Words escaped me at first, so I nodded too enthusiastically, trusting her not to think I was choking. Perhaps I was chewing. Maybe I was catching my breath mid-forkful. But then I had to ask, \"Are these supposed to be shared between two people? Have I misunderstood the whole CONCEPT of the restaurant?\" She assured me no, these are meant for individual consumption. It's sort of like Man vs. Food with every item on the menu. I threw my napkin down in defeat. My white flag draped across the seat.  Somehow I kept eating for a long time, as did my date. We both managed to finish about 2/3 of our plates. I'm no competitive eater, but I feel that I can put food away. More than one person has told me I eat like I'm in the Army. Don't think, just keep shoveling it in. But the food won. During my stay at the Hash House, I didn't see anyone clean their plate. The pork chop lady needed more than one box to bring her leftovers home. I would have taken mine back if only my hotel room included a microwave oven in the same drawer as the Gideon Bible.  I left the restaurant broken and slightly limping, but happy, sated. I didn't need breakfast the next day. Though I would have liked to see what kind of flapjacks this joint would turn out.",

The girls just kept talking to each other and walking away from us. After 5-10 minutes of being ignored, a man asked if we've been helped noticing that I looked annoyed and I said no so he finally seated us. Mind you we were the only ones waiting to be seated and they weren't busy. After that the dining experience was fine and he waiter was nice,but I wouldn't go back. I can't stand when the service sucks! Especially when the girls were too busy talking and being rude. Do your job!",

Nothing to rave about.  But my brother had the sage chicken and he could not finish the plate.  He said it was only ok.  My brother-in-law had the meatloaf and complain it was too dry.

We like taking out of town guests here b/c they always get a kick out of the industrial atmosphere and interesting menu choices. We used to eat here more before we evolved our diets to be more plant-based. There are only a few vegetarian options here and no vegan options (last we were there, which was probably over 2 years now). But... we would still recommend it. We've always been happy w/ the food. The service is just ok. We prefer more guinuine personalities and one waiter in particular seems like he's putting on a play.

Not only is there too much on the plate but there are too many items. Goat cheese, prosciutto, cashews, spiced yams, carrots, green beans, and more. But it doesn't all taste good together. They are all great edible items but they aren't really \"ingredients\" to a single cohesive dish. FAIL.  And to top it off, literally, there's an inedible twig of Rosemary and some sort of uncooked pasta noodles sticking up out of the mound of food. Waitwhat? Yeah.   I feel as if somewhere, like at the original HH in San Diego, the food is prepped and cooked the way that it is supposed to be. But here in Vegas, in this chain, it's lost in translation.

The flavor combinations sound amazing in the descriptions and the menu is full of incredible options.  However, the portion sizes, visually impressive as they are, are pretty much the sum total of what is wrong with us in America.  They're like an all-you-can-eat buffet in one dish. The problem with that is: A) you don't have a choice of how much to take and I guarantee you can't reasonably eat much more than half of it, and B) you don't really want to take it home because it's just not that awesome tasting.  The flavors are surprisingly blah, considering the descriptions. It's easy to understand why, when you see the sizes and you realize that not all that much care could possibly go into a dish of that size.  But, I still really liked the place.  Kind of like everything else in Vegas, it's a fun place to visit but you don't want to stay too long!",

We got one of the Farm Benedict entrees. The individual items on the plate were really good, but the way they poured/drenched the plate with hollandaise sauce was a bit nauseating. We'll def order the sauce on the side next time.  Our server was one of the best we'd  had all weekend! She was on top of it like no other and seriously made our morning.  CONS The hostess had her head up her a**. She was rude and lazy. The restaurant was mostly empty and yet somehow she couldn't bother to find us a table. She just glanced behind her into the dining area and made us wait for another 15 minutes.  Eventually what looked to be the the manager offered to seat us. But then on his way over he literally stopped to chit chat & shoot the sh*t with another staff member right in front of us. THEN he moseyed on over to come seat us.  All in all...  The Imperial Palace isn't the prettiest hotel to walk through to get to breakfast & the hostess sucks, but if you love a good bloody mary it might be well worth it.   Extra tip: Consider sharing a plate if you're not a giant eater. lol It's really tempting to want to try as much as you can, but it might be worth it to split one good plate & save a few bucks.",

Hash House a go go is a really fun breakfast brunch kind of joint.  They dont just have your basic continental breakfast.   They'll make you 1 pancake. and that pancake will be HUGE.  I'm 6'9 and i couldnt even fathom trying to eat more than half of my pancake.  Not to mentino the eggs and sausage along with it.  Personally i had the tractor driver combo which was like some eggs served to your liking, sausage/taters/bacon/ and a pancake.  But they're pancakes are lush and big. mine was  brown sugar and banana pancake.    Grandmother had french toast (more like french loaf) with pecan maple syrup.  Everything was delicious.  But beware it's probably a diabetic coma waiting to happen.  A lot of the things they have here are filled with sugar.    The surroundings are kinda Farmhouse meets modern life?   I'm horrible at describing interior designs but the entrance was filled with celebrity headshots with signatures saying how great hash house was.    My only beef with the place is it gets really busy (and loud because of it)  But if you can get beyond that it's a great place to take out of towners to cure a hangover.",

Finally, we get seated, server was rude. Food took another 30 minutes for the food to come out.   I order the sage fried chicken and waffles.. chicken was dry... waffles had barely enough syrup. But it was tasty, but not worth the wait or price. For those of you that have been to Roscoes.... that's the place for chicken and waffles.",

My friend ordered the chicken and waffles (that was featured on Man vs Food) and the 4 of us could have ate that. And us 4 girls love food.   Her chicken and waffles were good. I'm picky with fried chicken and I liked it. Her waffles had a strip of bacon in them. For me that was eh- I'm not a huge bacon fan.  I ordered their breakfast quesadilla. Our server kindly warned me that it would be pretty spicy- I love spicy. It actually wasn't spicy for me, just incredibly ginormous! But the quesadilla was amazing.  The service here was great, their food was fresh as well. Loved it. I would recommend this place greatly.",

    "text": "I came in this morning for the first time and ordered the crabcake hash breakfast plate special. What I received was a lukewarm crab cake that had no flavor, on a bed of what seem like six potatoes chopped up and browned, and a couple of eggs. First of all my son could've made those eggs and potatoes. There was no seasoning on them and nothing to them at all. When I ate the crabcake and got to the middle and found it to be cold, I asked my waiter for help. He was good enough to bring me another plate and that's what I was shocked. There was such a difference between the first place I was served and the second that it really turned me off. The crabcake was hot and even though it tasted basically the same it was freshly cooked. I can't figure out for the life of me why they would serve me that first plate, but I guess since I was by myself and sitting in the bar it wasn't any big deal. I don't have any idea if the other plates of food are better than what I got but I can tell you that I won't be back after this morning's experience.",

    "text": "If you care about value, then this is the place to eat breakfast/brunch when you are in Vegas, at the Imperial Palace.  After hearing about this place on Man vs. Food, my buddy and I came with the intention of eating our one meal of the day here.  We were met with a half-hour long wait, plenty of time to let our appetites work themselves into a tizzy as we decided on what to order.  As the 2 of us sat down, the group of 5 ladies next to us suggested that we split a single dish.  We scoffed at their suggestion and proceeded to order 3 entrees, intent on guaranteeing a heart attack before the age of 50.  The first dish to come out was the biscuits and gravy.  Now, I love biscuits and gravy in a way that is completely unnatural and unhealthy, some might say unholy, and I'm normally left wanting from weakly seasoned gravy with piddling amounts of sausage.  Not here!  There are meaty chunks of pork sausage in a nicely peppered gravy base over a couple hearty and moist biscuits, covered by scrambled eggs and sitting over a mound of mashed potatoes.  Hot damn, this was definitely one of the best breakfast items I've ever had and I will be back for this and only this when I come back to Vegas.  The item that had been featured on Man vs. Food and found its way into my dreams was the fried chicken benedict.  Overall, it was pretty satisfying but here's my beef with the dish. #1, you should call it a benedict if you don't poach the eggs, the yolks need to run all over the place and threaten you with delicious Salmonella, scrambled eggs is simply weak sauce.  #2, the benedict was served on biscuits, which was awesome cuz they were delish, but everything was then surrounded by a wall of mashed potatoes that turned the base into a gloppy mess.  #3, the fried chicken sounded fantastic as described by Adam Richman, but overall the seasoning left me wanting.  #4, I know bacon makes just about everything better, but this was a bit much.  And what's this about tomato slices?  Is this becoming a salad?!  The flavors together would've been better off in some God-forsaken breakfast sandwich but this was just too unwieldy.  Overall, I felt like less would've been more.  Finally, the 3rd item ordered was the Kokomo, aka the meatloaf sandwich.  Whoever their baker is, they deserve a prize, because the milk bread that they grill for this sandwich is simply fantastic, just as good as their biscuits.  The meatloaf was well-seasoned and extremely satisfying with good quality beef.  The only problems were the overload of roasted tomatoes, which gave me immediate heartburn with a single whiff, and the side of mac and cheese that, contrary to what our nice waitress said, was the most pedestrian mac and cheese I have ever eaten (you're better off eating Kraft Easy Mac), unsalted and watery penne in a strange mish-mash of oddly flavored cheeses.  The best part of all of the meal (other than the biscuits and gravy) was that we housed 3 plates of food with people staring at us in awe/fear/shame, and I felt I channeled my inner Adam Richman to successfully defeat our challenge.  For the prices, I'm not sure if any place in Vegas will give you as good a deal as the Hash House.  If you're a sane person, you could probably split a dish or order one and take the remnants home.  If you are looking for a gourmet breakfast, however, you may need to move on.",

They agreed and said they'd be up for the adventure and assist on the reviews.  Our first stop was the Hash House.  It's a little ways down Sahara to the normal part of Vegas.  Ambience is cool with the stainless steel tables and very casual and clean environment.  As we were getting seated, we couldnt' help but notice the portions.  They're gargatuan...almost in the same class as Belisle's in Anaheim for you old timers.   We sat down and ordered our drinks.  The wife had the plain old lemonade which she claims was one of the best she's ever had.  She didn't try the kiwi watermelon which is award winning.  We decided to order 2 meals for 4 peeps and split.  The waitress mentioned a 2.50 charge for the extra plate so she suggested getting a couple of sides so we opted for breakfast sausage. The first platter was their signature corned beef hash.  Made with their corned beef cut into strips and tossed with red onions, brown onions, and green onions, this corned beef hash was excellent. The 2nd platter was a bacon avocado scramble and this was delicious.  These 2 platters and the sides of sausage were more than enough to satiate our morning hunger.   Service was great and this is definitely a local place.  Highly recommend if you're a breakfast lover.",

Not only do they offer hashes, but there's a load of other stuff on the menu here too that I wish I would have been able to sample. But what I did end up tasting was the sage fried chicken and bacon waffle... that was pretty tasty, although I think the waffle would have been better if it was chopped up instead of just put in whole (of all the things I could think was weird, I thought that was weird). I had the roasted chicken house hash with rosemary, garlic, onions, and asparagus. This was all very good along with a fried green tea (I still don't know why it's \"fried\"), due to my previous night of drinking.   Which leads me to my next statement: if there's a hangover cure, it's at Hash House.",

They almost always have a long wait which takes away from the quality of service.  Plus, their food is greasy and not very fresh tasting.  They also don't have good healthy options on their menu.  However, I'm sure most people who are going out to eat in Las Vegas aren't looking for healthy meals so I get why people flock to this spot.",

Portions are generally big enough to feed two medium sized appetites, but be warned they charge for split plates.  The wait is pretty long, especially if you have large parties and if it's the weekend.  We got there at 1:30PM on Sunday and ended up waiting for 45 minutes. If it's summer you'll be forced to wait outside in 100F+ heat.  Andy's Sage Chicken /w maple reduction - The chicken was soggy and tasteless.  The biscuit was overly dry and over baked.   Mango Coconut Pancake - What a poorly designed dish and poorly executed to go with it.  Yes, it's huge but the combination is something left to be desired.  Staff seems to be overworked and over burdened, our waitress didn't really pay that much attention to us except to swing by our table to drop off our food.",

    "text": "I have mixed emotions about this place. First of all, good grief the lines! I must have passed by the restaurant several times during my vacation before I found the place without a line out the door. (Mid-week, 6pm-ish).  The look of the place is cool. I like the rustic, shabby-chic thing they have going on. The staff were great. The hostess was busy seating someone when I came in, but the very nice lady at the bar informed me she'd be right back. I was seated within 5-minutes of walking in the door. A fantastic start.  My server was Tiffany, same woman from the bar when I entered. She was so nice and friendly and has a great sense of humor (as I asked her if she was stalking me). She took my drink order and let me look at the biiig menu. I had gone in to the restaurant craving BBQ, but saw the Chicken and Waffles on the menu and had to have them.   As I waited for my meal to arrive, someone brought me the HHAGG (horrible acronym) version of pre-meal bread. A Big-Ass-Biscuit (no, they didn't call it that). Buttermilk biscuit with honey glaze on it served with whipped honey butter and honey on the side. I only took a couple of bites because I saw the dishes coming out for other diners and I knew I'd better not eat the whole thing. Flavor of the biscuit was good. It was, however, a bit on the dry side.  My meal showed up and I had to bust out laughing. Seriously? That is one giant tower of food. All held together with a giant skewer and a knife stabbed through it. Tiffany said they 'don't mess around'. clearly!  And here's where the mixed emotions come in. The chicken was definitely missing something. I wish I knew what, but it was just so bland. I thought perhaps I was missing some nuance of flavor, so I took a moment to drink some water and pulled a piece of just chicken. The meat was just slightly dry and completely void of flavor. Huh? I tore off some of the fried skin/coating and tired that, which was also bordering on flavorless. How could this be? I can see flecks of .. well .. something in the coating. I don't get it. Bummer.  The Waffles, however, were heaven. Waffles with bacon cooked right inside, covered in syrup. Mmmmm. Sweet and salty heaven. If I could have had just a plate of those waffles, I'd have been a happy soul. Tiffany mentioned that they sometimes have a pancake with bacon AND chocolate chips in it. Holy Cow! I'd love to try that.  I would definitely come here again, preferably with several hungry friends that all order something different and are willing to share tastes. And I'd probably ask to sit in Tiffany's area because she was a real superstar, fun and friendly.",

The pancake was the size of a medium pizza! It could have fed two people.  I also tasted my bf's HH Famous Meatloaf Hash with crispy potatoes, two eggs, a biscuit, and a slice of watermelon. This dish backs up Hash House a go go self-proclaimed \"Twisted Farm Food\" nickname. The meatloaf cubes mixed with roasted red peppers, spinach, and smoked mozzarella was an interesting and unique combination of ingredients. When I think of hash, corn beef hash usually comes to mind, but meatloaf hash?! It was good stuff. The meatloaf cubes may be off putting as it looks pre-made and spam-like, but they tasted soft and meaty as expected.   Wait times vary, but I was there on a Friday morning before noon and waited about 20 minutes for a table. For a quick bite, try sitting at the bar. They also had a patio section, but it was too hot to sit outside even with the misters.  Come hungry for Claim Jumper sized portions!   Next to try: Sage fried chicken with a bacon waffle tower! I also want to check out the San Diego location.",

It was juicy and tender, and the rest of the ingredients definitely went well together with the chicken. The only weird part was the cheese, somehow it took away a little from the rest of the meal. I ended up removing the cheese layer off the top. But this place is a must go to place. If for nothing else, come for the experience. I would recommend sharing as well because the portions are enormous. Anyway, strangely enough, the meal wasn't the best part, it was the JAM. Made every day, there are, I think, 4 types of jam that they serve on different days. I had the strawberry jam and it was perhaps the best part of my meal. It was just that good. TRY THE JAM!",

Bigger does not always mean better as we can attest to when people watching in this town.  Service was rushed and when we placed the order, it came out not even 5 min later which leads me to believe there may be a few vats in the kitchen which are mix and match.   First time had eggs benny w fried chix. Unsure what I was thinking w that one but it had that hospital cafeteria tasteless look and taste. Second time had the scramble with bacon and avocado which was of the same same. Perhaps the lunch and dinner is the way to go go here.",

The benedict had chicken, bacon, tomatoes, mash potatoes, biscuits, and eggs topped with chipotle cream. The chipotle cream was AMAZING! The cream was  so good, I ate it all and realized I still have to eat the chicken, eggs, and biscuits (I guess I ate all the cream with the mash potatoes?). And after that, it was just dry from there. I thought it was just me, but my friends also experienced the same scenario. Delicious at first, but a bit bland at the end. Maybe if there was just a little bit more delicious chipotle cream, I'd be good.   With that aside, the wait can be a bit long so be prepared for that. The portions are HUGE. I suggest sharing. If you do share, I guess you pay a fee, but they waived that fee if you get side orders.",

    "text": "Great food, but terrible service! Called them to alert them that we would be arriving with a large group of 10 of us at 10 am on a Friday morning. Were told that they only take reservations with 24 hours notice. Got there around 9:45 and was told there would be a 40 min wait. No biggie, I thought. I noticed as we were standing outside, patiently waiting our 40 minutes, there was a large, empty table that was set for 12 out on the patio. I went in and asked the hostess if we could sit at this table outside and was told that there were 2 other large groups ahead of us. Again, not a big deal. At the 30 min mark, we were surprised when we were told our table was ready!  YEA! 10 minutes early.  My excitement faded when we were lead straight to the empty table outside we had been staring at for the past 30 minutes!  ARGH!  How frustrating!!  This was our second visit this year to this place and a similar situation happened on our first visit..they had half the place empty but a long wait time?  I don't think they know how to manage their staff very well.   We waited for about 10 min before our waiter (who turned out to be the bartender from inside) came to get out order. He said he was there to take our drink order and I told him we were all ready to order food as well.  I was told \"lets get the drinks out of the way and I will be back for the food orders after\"  We all ordered our drink and I was impressed he didn't write a THING down! Needless to say, our drink order was screwed up. When he came back to take our food order, he wrote it all down this time, but was almost rude as he did so. After about 15 minutes our food arrived. One, plate,  and one person,at, a, time. First the bacon, then the eggs..etc.  it was painful to experience.  We of course waited until the last person was served to start eating and by then the first couple of people's food was cold. No one came to check on us during our breakfast and we had to hunt down our waiter to get the check which took another 10 minutes. Again, the food is awesome and the portions are ridiculously huge but the service is worse than anything.  PS: The \"sound system\" on the outdoor patio sounds like it was coming from a cell phone. TERRIBLE quality.",

    "text": "Another Food Restaurant featured on Man vs Food and Triple D's. This place was recommended to me by my concierge. I gotta say that was a good recommendation. She said to only go to this one which is located on Sahara Ave. I went here, walked in and on the walls in the entrance they have pictures with all kinds of celebs that have been to this location. The decor was nice.   I chose to order the chicken and waffles. One thing I have to say is this place is pricey, so if your not willing to pay almost $20 to eat one of there special dishes per person, then your not going to like this place. But in defense of the price every plate I saw coming out of the kitchen the portions were humongous beyond normal. Even larger than Claim Jumpers portions.  No one person can eat an entire plate alone.   The chicken and waffles I ordered came with two huge chicken breast 4 big waffles with bacon inside with fried leaks, green onions, red, yellow and orange bell peppers with two tomatoes on the side. You get two huge biscuits with the order your as well. I would recommend Hash House A Go Go to anyone that wants to try them out.",

    "text": "Hash House represents one \"reel\" of my foodie jackpot winnings in Vegas. Absolutely love this place!  During a mere 5 minute wait at 9ish am,  I checked out the celeb wall of fame. Man vs. Food's been here.  Impressive but more so, I loved the friendly attitude and commitment to customer service here.  Of course, the food was kickass and doled out in manly man sized servings. There must be a prereq to working here.  You must be fun and ubercool. There was no shortage of interesting tats and off the chart hair color.  Regardless, the hostess and the servers were really nice.   There was a literally a slight \"mixup\" in my oatmeal order but no biggie.  The server and the kitchen manager (?) were very considerate.   Yes, I actually ordered oatmeal despite being surrounded by foodie heavenly delights which were beckoning my name.  However, I resisted.  Well, no, actually, I did succumb to temptation and took a taste or two of hub's Fried Chicken eggs benedict.  Woman vs. food and food won. Now, this is no ordinary or traditional eggs benedict.  This was the kitchen sink gourmet version over yummy biscuits.  Each presented with a nice sharp knife on top of a huge pile of food.  How fitting.  My oatmeal was very satisfying with a pile of beautifully presented fruit on top. Think oatmeal... Carmen Miranda style.  Kiddo's pancake was the size of a Frisbee.  He ate a hole in the middle equivalent to 2 ordinary sized pancakes.   I know it's not \"manly\" to share dishes, but if you come in a group, it's too hard to not want to try someone else's entree, so I would recommend family style ordering.  The ambiance is laid back, modern and all walks of life come here.  Cool.... We'll def be back next time we're in town!!!!",

We like this location because of easy parking and it's mainly filled with locals.  Timing is everything.  Sometimes there is a long wait to be seated.  The last couple of times we've been here they have botched up part of my meal which has been disappointing.  Today, I ordered a scrambled dish and I found raw egg in my food (it looked like snot) which I brought to the Manager's attention.  She offered to replace the meal which was declined but did not give us the option to take a couple of dollars off the meal.  Unfortunately, we will not be back to this location.  We are going to have to suck it up on the Strip with the long walk from the parking station through a smoky casino and line of tourists to get consistent, well cooked meals.  *PS* The Carmel Mocha drink was awesome - hence the 4 stars.",

The children safely chatter as they sit on the long benched seats and enjoy adding color to their personal menus. 80's rock songs keep them humming as I watch Paul, our charming server, fill the stainless steel table with fried green tomatoes, endless refills of lemonade, an Andy's Chowder and a Sage Fried Chicken with Penne.

I don't think I've ever seen this concoction before but it was pretty tasty. We added vodka to ours!  3. Mushroom and artichoke scramble - very plain. It was very simply cooked and not as seasoned as the sage chicken and waffles. It was also on the dry side. If they added some cheese or hollandaise sauce, I think it would make the dish a lot better.   4. BLT Bloody Mary - I've had my fair share of bloody Mary's and I can say that this doesn't make the top 5 on my list.",

I sent it back and was told they would make a fresh one cooked correctly. Of course, by the time I got the second order, my two friends were done with their meals. I cut it in half again, and it was pink. I decided the best bet was just to order something else. I only ate a bit because I felt badly about my friends just sitting there.

I ordered three staples that \"put them on the map\": Bloody Mary Chicken Benedict  Chicken and waffles (wife)  Bloody Mary was ok 3/5. Chicken Benedict was ok as well--chicken was dry as all hell, mashed potatoes were really good, but overall the plate was just decent. My wife had the same issue with her chicken being dry.   The worst part of this experience was getting the bill--WAY OVERPRICED!  Save a ton of money and just go to an Egg Works. Way better food and you'll save money.   2/5 because the food and service were just ok. However, the price was insane for what you get (Hyperbole intended).   Bali Hai Golf Course bar has the earths best Bloody Mary--FYI.  Hash Hash has since responded to my original post--very classy. Because this joint give's a sh*% about their client experience, I added a star. I agree with the responder in regards to splitting meals and their portions being large. With all that being said, the chicken was still dry",

Their portions are large, but their flavor is absent. For just okay food, you will pay more than you should.   I ordered the sage chicken and waffles. The waffle is cooked around slices of bacon, but it's a gross bacon- reminded me of turkey bacon, which isn't bacon at all. There's nothing creative or mind-blowing about this version of chicken and waffles and if I ever get dragged back to HH, I will not be ordering it again.  I'm comparing this (and every other chicken and waffle dish that I try) to Gussie's in San Francisco, where the chicken was juicy and flavorful and they put a creative spin on syrup.",

I'm not sure how anyone can finish a meal here. BELIEVE YOU ME, I eat a lot of food, and after about half a plate of this rich goodness I about wanted to puke so I can eat some more.  The chicken and waffle tower was very delicious.  The other chicken thing I had was tasty also..  And the monster burger we shared was cooked perfectly. I loved the texture of the meat, not ground and smashed to taste like an over processed patty, it was just right.  This is not gourmet food, this is stick to your love handles and double chin home cooking. Don't come expecting anything more than some good ole classic American lovin!  I think this is a place to visit once in a while, or when you are feeling like becoming obese.  With that said, I give it a 4 stars. The creator of this magic put a lot of thought and care into the good stuff and I definitely believe they deserve your business.",

We walked in and were greeted right away. We were told there was a little bit of a wait, but if we wanted to sit in the bar area we could be seated right away. Since we were hungry and didn't mind, we chose the bar. Our server, Robert P., provided great service. He was knowledgeable about the dishes we had questions about, was professional and kind, and not once did we have to look for him for any drink refills. We ordered Andy's sage fried chicken benedict and the roasted chicken house hash. Everything was cooked perfectly and the portions were big, even for my big man. We had plenty of leftovers. We highly recommend this place.",

After a short wait of approximately 25 minutes, my wife and I were seated in the bar area. This location is HUGE with lots of space, and every inch is needed since it gets really busy. The bar area was fine for dining, but the music was a bit too loud for a Saturday morning; I'm usually not one to complain about loud music, but I honestly couldn't hear my wife who was sitting two feet away from me over the blaring music.   The service was pretty decent and our waitress was prompt and attentive considering how busy she was. The folks at Hash House A Go Go definitely have character (and dress up as various characters like Wonder Woman and Superman), but also do their jobs well.   The service gets 4 stars, but I cannot justify giving this place a thumbs up because their food is underwhelming. The food runner needed both arms and a lot of strength to deliver our meatloaf hash. The meatloaf hash along with the chicken and waffles were enough to feed to a family of four...but we both gave it the old college try and dug right in. The chicken and waffles were big, but only in quantity; they certainly were not big in either flavor or taste. Putting two whole chicken breasts and mixing bacon into the waffles sounds nice in theory, but the execution here is poor. The meatloaf hash didn't fare much better, as it tasted like what I would imagine soylent green to taste like; just a blob of flavorless food once you put together all the components.   Considering Vegas is a city with some of the world's finest dining, the food here is the exact opposite of that. Lacking in any sort of complexity, the only reason I would ever go back here is to load up on carbs and salty ass food after a hard night of drinking.",

It's a beautiful presentation with the two fried breasts piled on top of three bacon stuffed waffles, all topped with fried green onions on a very large plate.  This order usually comes with the syrup poured over the order. I asked them not to do that so my waffles don't get too mushy.   Even though it came out as ordered, the waffles were horribly mushy. It seemed like they were made way before my order was taken and sat around in the kitchen for a long time. Then they were just thrown on my plate.   So the waffles were not edible, in fact they were YUKKY! And this is from a food that will eat anything .  The fried chicken was OK. Again, the bottom of the chicken that was touching the waffles were very moist. It did not seem like the chicken was freshly cooked, rather, it sits on top of those very un-crisp waffles for a while before it comes out of the kitchen.  We sat at the counter on a very busy sunday. The service was excellent. Fast, friendly and the coffee always full.",

Once you are inside, the decor is awesome.  This location is all glass and steel mixed with warm inviting colors.  Order one of their signature drinks or a mimosa...  a bit pricey but hey, go for it..  This is Vegas, baby!  Staff is friendly and very attentive...  On my most recent visit, my friend and I ordered the fried chicken Benedict and when they brought it out, we were in complete amazement.  I thought it must be a joke and we were on TV.  This thing is so big and so much food it should be on Epic Meal Time!  We were barely able to finish it with two people and didn't need any lunch that day either.  The size of the dish didn't in any way take away from the quality and flavor or the food.  The sauce they use is so good I can't even describe it.

Meatloaf to die for. And the fried chicken...whoa.

    "text": "The nearly hour and a half wait for food (45 min for table and 45 min after getting a table) was well worth it for a good meal to wash away the stupor from the previous night and fill up for the current day of activities.  The portions definitely are big which, if you do have an average appetite, is best for sharing and makes this place super affordable compared to going to a $20 plus buffet. The wife and I shared the bacon and avocado burger, which is a pretty massive burger with two patties spillilng over the sides of the bun.  The patties are pretty thin though, so they are not as juicy if they actually fit on the bun propertly or were just one single patty.  Still, it made it easier to bite into and was still pretty tasty with plenty of thick bacon and crispy fries. We also shared the biscuits and gravy with some others at the table, which the biscuit was really dry, but you didn't notice it much drowned in a peppery, chunky sausage gravy.  Definitely worth searching through the depths of the Imperial Palace.",

It is too good to order something else, but each time I wait for my food to be delivered, I see awesome dishes going elsewhere that are great temptations.  Sooner or later, I will expand my menu horizon.  Service is 4-star.  Always friendly, never pushy, but once very slow.  All in all, however, I highly recommend hash house.  Tips: On Sunday mornings, get there before 9am to beat the crowd.  If only two of you are dining, consider splitting one enter and ordering a side dish.  Plates are big enough for two, and by adding a side dish, you get around the charge for sharing plates.",

A large fresh squeezed juice was L-A-R-G-E - I like that.  Four of us each had something different and we were each very pleased.  The two things that really shined were the french toast (the best I've ever had anywhere) and that came with broiled bananas (mmm, I gonna make those at home! - thanks to my friend for giving me a bite!) and my husband's corned beef hash.  Oh the other thing was my griddled mashed potatoes - Oh yum!  Since we were traveling we couldn't take the rest of our food home, but we sure would have.  Big portions, as you have already heard, so if you don't want to share then be prepared to take it home and that will give you another meal the next day!  Service was fine and the entire experience was very positive.",

You'd think they'd at least make good hash, considering the name, but it's just some fried potato chunks and meat blobs thrown together (the pork one).  Or just fried potatoes with a crab-flavored bread patty on top.  When you figure what you spent on a too-huge portion of carbs it doesn't add up.  One person can't eat it all, but too often you discover you don't want to eat most of it.  I'd love to have good diner hash....or good diner anything...instead of these supposedly updated versions.  The novelty of huge wears off quickly.  The only thing I like is the Hash House salad which is just lettuce with a light cucumber dressing.",

Instead, we waited over an hour for our food (after we sat down).  After we had waited about 30 minutes we asked our waiter where the food was.  Instead of telling us the truth - the computer broke and orders were not getting to the kitchen correctly - he told us all the food is made fresh.  Wow, like I have never had fresh food at a restaurant in my life.  Thanks for the wonderful explanation waiter!  The manager later told us the truth, but only after I hunted him down.    It was so bad one of my friends walked out and we stiffed the waiter on the tip.  The restaurant made no effort to comp our table (another table basically argued for a comp and got one).      I can understand computer glitches and mishaps, but explain it to me, offer me something while I wait (hey, you guys want a beverage on the house?), or discount our meal.  Instead, you get a waiter who is shafted and an angry Yelp review.",

Everything here looks so good it is tough to decide on what to eat and drink, as you want to try everything.  The spiked Limeade is a perfect morning-after cocktail; tart enough to mask out the taste of vodka and served with a massive oversize straw for big gulping.  The Gin Mary is really good too, and I am not really into Bloody Marys that much.  Portions are huge.  Had the Favorite Scramble with the salmon, pesto, and brie and tomato.  Biscuit the best I've had in a while. Also a great place to people watch, found myself admiring all the ink, piercings, and different hair colors of the fellow clientele.  Wish I lived near this place, but then again it wouldn't be good for my diet. Probably better that's it's a once-a-year visit. Will return.",

    "text": "So, I've eaten at this place off and on for years and in the past they have been good, even with the long waits:  engaging service and good food.  They get rave reviews and tons of publicity on TV, newspapers and weeklies.  I don't have a probelm with a place that tries hard and sucks.  What I do have is a problem with places who act entitled and that long waits for seating, ambivalent service, longer waits for food, and bland meals are ok, because HEY, we're on Man vs. Food.  We were picked best of Las Vegas.  Well, news flash.  You guys have gone down hill.  Your food has become Meh, your customer service (remember us?  your customers?  The reason you have a restaurant?)  sucks.  I went in on Sunday to take my mom and girlfriend to brunch.  We were told an hour wait.  No biggie.  We'll go elsewhere.  Went back Mon at noon with my girl and an old friend.  Our waiter could have given two craps, which is fine, it'll just reflect in the tip.  We then sat and sat and sat waiting on our food.  My girlfriend asked the waiter what the deal was and he lamely stated my pancake was the problem.  As in it took an hour to cook a pancake.  I asked him what the deal was and he meekly stated it will be out soon.  Awesome.  I got the hostess to get a manager who came out and although very nice told me he had a shortage in the kitchen and was doing all he could including helping prep the food himself.  I sympathize bud, but when you've made people wait 1 hour and 17 minutes (no lie ) for lunch, the least you can do is take drinks off the tab or apologize.  This place is now part of Vegas.  In the bad way.  It has picked up the pretentious attitude of so many counterparts and almost says, \"hey you need us more than we need you.\"  I for one will resume going to the Original Pancake House and the ever awesome Bagel Cafe, who have not let success get to their head.  Oh, and I almost forgot about the food, you know why WE went there.  My girlfriend would rather have gone to Capriottis and my buddy In N Out.  Save yourself the wait and the attitude and hit up the Bagel instead.",

Now that it has been featured on a couple of Food Network shows and every Tom, Dick and Harry are coming here from the strip, it has gone way down hill.  The service and management has become just like the strip restaurants, high volume and with no care for customer service.  We decided to give it another chance on 7/5/10.  I will sum this experience up real quick. Horrible!  Got there at 11:00 waited till 12 to sit down because of the wait, no problem, as expected.  Unfortunetely, numerous parties (party of 4) who came in behind us were seated before us (party of 3). Finally we were seated. We placed our order and 35 minutes later we had our order taken again because of \"lost ticket' or \"forgot the order\" whatever.  Had to ask for the manager to come over after they sent over a waiter to apologize.  Finally we got our food, no check back to see how everything was or to apologize and then they lay the check down.  We all have worked in the restaurant industry and never look for a free meal but how bout a little discount or something. NOTHING!  Had to ask for the manager again to come over.  Lets sum this up, none of us will ever come back and we will take our business down the road to a much better breakfast joint on West Flamingo.  If you want a crappy strip experience with huge portions of so so food then this is definetely your place.  We gladly will give this restaurant back to the strip folk.  Enjoy.",

I was nervous to try the chicken and waffles because, well, those aren't supposed to go together. I was further put off by the fact that they make them with sage and leeks here (like wtf? How does that go with maple?!). But it did. It was soooo did.   Sage chicken and waffles with leeks and bacon: A+++  In sum: 1. If you're in Vegas, come here for breakfast. 2. Share. This is far too much food. Seriously. 3. If you think the chicken and waffles sound gross, keep an open mind and get them anyway. YOLO.",

    "text": "Taking a break from traditional Vegas buffets, I decided to give this place a try with friends. They're located about 5 miles west of the strip on Sahara Ave. Although the place was fairly busy for a Monday morning, we only waited about 10 minutes for our seat.   There rustic and casual take on traditional breakfast and comfort food is insanely good. We ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles, smoked salmon scramble and blueberry pecan flapjacks. We were visually wowed when our food arrived.  The sage fried chicken and waffles was massively huge, piled high and beautifully presented. It must have been stacked 8-10 inches high and artistically decorated with huge sprigs of rosemary and sage leaves. I didn't know whether to eat it or pray to the food gods. It was truly amazing and the quality was downright excellent and delicious.The chicken was well seasoned, tender, light crisp on the outside and scrumptious. Inside the waffles were infused with bits and pieces of bacon which caught me off guard and happily surprised. Gratifyingly savory while still sweet, they're definitely better than any chicken and waffles I've tasted before. It makes Rosco's chicken and waffles in LA more like a kid's meal.   For you pancake lovers, their flapjacks are incredibly huge and almost the size of a pizza. Most importantly, it was delicious. They don't skimp on toppings either. Each flapjack was packed and full of blueberries and pecans. Every bite had something in it.   On a more civilized level, the smoked salmon scramble portions were smaller and regular size compared to the other dishes. Both the brie and pesto provided scrumptious fusion of flavor and texture. Accompanied with potato hash and toast, it was tasty and hearty breakfast.  The food here is crazy good and prices are very reasonable (entree $10-$15). Our server was friendly, attentive and refilled our coffee and water promptly. While their over the top presentation and massive portions can be a bit overwhelming and mammoth, they make sure that taste and quality take center stage as well. Enjoyed my first visit and hope to come back many more...",

I think one plate of anything you order is a good amount that can be shared by three people. It's that crazy big! I love their crispy potatoes! The bacon waffle, a must try! Everything here is a heart attack on a plate. But they are all so good.   We attended Flavors of the Heart last Saturday and they were there sampling their crab cakes. I just want to commend their chef because it was good and it was one of my favorites!   Love what you do for the AHA!",

We sat at a high top and were told by our server, who was also the bartender, he would be with us soon. At that point another couple came in, sat at the bar, were engaged in conversation and the same guy who said he'd be with us shortly began making their drinks and taking their order. Our menus had been down for at least a few minutes - a clear sign that we were ready to order. Not well done, at all. Won't be going back to that location.  UPDATE: Since this post, I've been back to this location and I must say the situation was much improved. The service and the food were both excellent!",

I give it 5 stars because of the service.  Very attentive. My husbands order arrive about 15 minutes before mine. The server offered his apologies and stated the first chicken wasn't done. The chicken I received was so dry it was hard to swallow. Since they are famous for their chicken I assume this is not normal and may be the result of over cooking due to the first set being underdone.  I allow this exception because of the great service and attentiveness of the server. Normally this would have been my first and only try. However, because of the server I will most definitely be back. My husbands pork tenderloin was to die for. See you again soon.",

We went on a Sunday at around 11:30 and were told that it would be a 30 minute wait (our fault for not making a reservation). After watching around 15 different groups of people leave because the wait had jumped up to an hour, we ended up only waiting around 20 minutes.   After we got seated however, we waited another 10 minutes for a waitress to even introduce herself and take our drink order. We were ready to order our food, but she walked away so quickly that we couldn't catch her her in time.  After that, another 10 minutes for us to get our drinks and put in our order. I understand that they were busy, but that seamed a little ridiculous. However, our food came out quickly and it was absolutely amazing! The portion sizes were huge and none of us were able to finish.   Overall a great experience.",

    "text": "I'm sorry, but I really don't know why this place is so hyped-up.   My husband and I came here on a Saturday morning for brunch. The wait time was about 20 minutes, which I did not mind and was expecting anyway, seeing how crowded the restaurant was. The waiting area was pretty small, but it was fun looking at the autographed pictures of celebrities that they had on their wall, such as Penn and Teller, Ne-Yo, and Neil Patrick Harris.   Melissa was our server. She was alright, but not the greatest. It took a while for her to greet us and take our orders, but I understand that they were extremely busy. After we got our food, she did check up on us twice, but did not refill our drinks once. The thing that annoyed me was that she seemed extra friendly to the party who sat in back of us. I heard her asking them if this was their first time at the restaurant, and they responded that it was. She gave them a friendly welcome and explained the menu to them. That's funny, it was our first visit here as well and she never bothered to ask us that!  My husband and I decided to share the chicken and waffles. We also ordered two sides - bacon and the biscuits and gravy to avoid the $2.50 split plate charge.  Just an FYI: yes, they charge $2.50 if you are splitting plates, but you can avoid it if you order a side dish. I have to say, the presentation of our food and everyone else's around us was nice and pretty! But, I wasn't impressed. The chicken was dry, and even though the waffles looked awesome because they had strips of bacon cooked into them, it didn't taste that great. Our order got screwed up as well. Apparently our biscuits and gravy = a side of sausage.   I'm willing to give Hash House A Go Go another try in the future. Maybe we just ordered the wrong dish. But it's definitely not somewhere that I am dying to come back to again.",

    "text": "Disappointing! First of all, their claim-to-fame is HUGE portions. If you want a plate of food that will serve a family of four, this is your place. Do not go there unless you are mega-hungry.  A friend and I went for \"linner,\" late lunch/early dinner. I wasn't famished, so had the \"tractor driver's breakfast:\" 2 eggs, 2 sausages and a waffle. No biscuit, no hasbrowns, just eggs, sausage and waffle. $12.99. The sausages were delicious. The waffle was large, but nothing special. The eggs were tiny. Two of them equaled one regular sized egg. Maybe they were pigeon eggs or something.  My friend wanted a hamburger, but all their burgers are \"double\"\" 2 meat patties with stuff in between -- mushrooms, onion, cheese... Again, if you want to eat so much that you are uncomfortable for the next 8 hours, this is your place. She ordered the one single burger -- I think the \"baby burger\". $11.99. She said it was alright -- nothing special.  We both had coffee ($3). So the bill came to nearly $33 for a very ordinary meal. With tip, nearly $40. Coulda got the same thing at Denny's for half that and would've been happy.   IF you go, order one of their signature plates (sage chicken, etc.) and be prepared to take 1/2 home. If you go on a weekend, you will wait a long time to be seated; it will be LOUD. Music blares. Conversation is not possible. This is my third and last visit. (Just say I believe in second and third chances. Or maybe I'm just a slow learner.)   With all the good quality restaurants in Las Vegas, I do not recommend this place except as a \"one-time experience\" so you can waddle away saying \"I'm never going to eat again! I never saw so much food on one plate in my life!\" Not worth it -- really.",

    "text": "After keeping myself alive on a steady diet of strip buffets and large amounts of liquor, I wanted to fill up on something delicious before heading back home.  The last time I came to Vegas, we'd wanted to try this place but the wait was long and we were all cranky and bitchy, so I knew this was the day!  We were determined.  We woke up at 8am feeling like a train had run us over, repeatedly.  Starved, we headed towards Hash House a Go Go, conveniently located about 5 miles from our hotel.  When we got there, there was a fifteen minute wait for a table, or we could sit at the bar right away.  We opted to wait for a table while we looked at the menu.  I was hesitant about ordering the fried chicken Benedict just because it was on man vs food, but it genuinely sounded freaking awesome, so we did.  My friend and I split the damn thing, and we still didn't finish our portion.  I believe it consisted of a biscuit, tomato, fresh spinach, eggs, bacon, fried chicken, griddled cheese (oh my god, griddled cheeeese), topped with chipotle sauce, on a bed of mofuggin potatoes! Shiiiiiiiiiiit.  I think I just came.  From arrival to consumption of said chicken benedict, we were only there for about an hour, which was great considering I was expecting to be waiting for at least one.  When we headed out the door I heard someone say there was an almost hour wait.  So I'd suggest if you're planning on heading home early or managing your time for whatever reason, go early!  The food was delicious (seriously deserving of a five) and everything else on the menu looked just as good.",

I ordered a buttermilk pancake(and believe me one is enough), eggs, sausages and potatoes and everything was very good. The service was good but not great, we had to ask for several things several times- not servers fault I think they're understaffed. I would say the only gripe I have is they give you this humongous pancake a small pat of butter and this little, tiny thimble of syrup! If I'm eating a pancake too big for my plate I want it smothered in butter and syrup pouring over the sides! All in all everyone was happy with what they ordered and I would definitely return next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "At my house we have several names for this place:  Hash House a NO Go, Hash House a No No, and Hash House a No Mo'.  The main problem is that Man vs. Food hyped the place as being excellent with humongous portions. We wanted to experience it just for the novelty.  Amongst the three of us we had the pancakes with hash browns, eggs over easy and chicken sausage; the Apple Smoked Bacon & Mashed Potato Burger with fries and watermelon lemonade, and the Hardwood Smoked Bacon, Avocado & Cheddar Burger with the same fries. We also tried the barbecued ribs appetizer.  First, the lemonade, which was tasty, was $5.00, no refills. That's way overpriced for lemonade that isn't spectacular, but it was attractive looking. Next, we specifically asked for the appetizer to be brought out before the meal (sort of the definition of the term \"appetizer,\" right? We shouldn't have had to say anything) but it came AFTER the meal was brought out. How ridiculous is that? So two disappointments.  When the pancake came out it was large, but it was underwhelming compared to the hype it got on TV.  Yes it was really big- bigger than one outstretched medium sized female hand. It filled up maybe 2/3 of the oval plate it was served on, leaving room for maybe one cup of cubed potatoes (hashbrowns) and 2 eggs over easy. But check out this photo from Man vs. Food: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyhoo.it%2F18O6aVt&s=d9811c4bd5617105cbdeeb114816964c45d093702e6bc244e87b563c725c07bf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">yhoo.it/18O6aVt</a> - this was CLEARLY nothing close to what we got, hence the disappointment.   The seasoned potatoes had no flavor, and the pancake tasted like flour.  No flavor at all.  We asked for chicken sausage and one link arrived, splayed open on a small dish. It was basically a hot dog, not sausage.  On to the Apple Smoked Bacon & Mashed Potato Burger. The teenager enjoyed it greatly, however, the teenager likes just about anything. The burger has one pound of meat divided into two pre-made, pre-seasoned patties that are cooked in a press of some kind so that both sides are cooked simultaneously. This means no way to request medium rare.  Sigh...  The Hardwood Smoked Bacon, Avocado & Cheddar Burger was tasty, although the meat flavor seemed to come from the grill without additional seasoning. Well, let's just say the seasoning was mild. I won't complain too much about the burger- it was satisfying.  The fries serving size was average. I think they were seasoned, and had a nice crunch.   The ribs came in what appeared to be an Asian-inspired sauce, which I liked. One of the  four ribs was perfect, with tender meat falling off the bone. The others were chewy and tough. Hate to speculate on the disparity- I'll leave that to you. They were artfully leaned against a pile of cold, nasty-tasting potatoes.  What a waste of potato. We got the impression that much of the food is pre-packaged, pre-seasoned, so not much creativity happens in the preparation.  The atmosphere was different from what I expected- the dark lighting made a nice ambience even though the food is Denny's quality.  I liked the distressed wood everywhere and the (very) heavy metal chairs.  So, we will chalk this up to experience and probably not come back as a family, although I'd bring the teen here if he wanted the burger again. for $13 it wasn't so awful in my opinion.   Oh- the waitress was EXCELLENT- she got a full 20% tip.",

I ordered the chicken and waffles.  I was kinda expecting to get the Roscoe's style chicken n waffles (which I also love).... but it was totally different.  They brought out my plate with a huge piece of chicken sitting on top of four big bacon waffles... yup that's right, BACON WAFFLES.  They actually had slices of bacon going through the middle of the waffles. I didn't read that part on the menu, so that was the best surprise a chicken n waffles dish could offer.  I mean who doesn't love bacon?!  And the portions were HUGE.  Go to this place hungry.  And if you have Twitter, tweet that your eating there (@HashHouseLV) and you get a free drink!

I had the meatloaf, egg and potatoes meal.  The meatloaf was so dry I almost dosed it with ketchup and I hate ketchup.  Some times it's the little things that set you off.  Biscuits.  We had a choice of rye or wheat bread a biscuit.  Being a die hard sourdough guy I took the biscuit.  Our server did not bring butter, jam or honey and did not ask if we would like any.  My brain usually kicks in about the time a server has just left, but on this occasion I asked after not being offered anything.  Butter and jam where brought back to the table.  No choice of what kind of jam I would prefer.  No mention of honey maybe being available. My requested over medium eggs were of course over easy - nobody gets that right.  The potatoes not very memorable.  So high expectations added to by the crowd of people waiting for a table and a plate with awful meatloaf add up to a ONE STAR I don't know how anybody could call this amazing and I am not inclined to give them a second chance.

However, I could overshadow that with the fact that it was yummy sauce.    Our server was awesome, and a real friendly guy.  He didn't even bat an eyelash when we all used twitter to get a free drink (Mango Iced Tea, that day).  He also encouraged a friend in his Man v. Food challenge.

Other folks in my party had the scrambles, french toast, and the bf had chicken and waffles.  Anytime I'll be in Vegas or SD, I'll be sure to pay Hash House a visit.  Be prepared to wait about an hour or so for a table because patrons will sit forever, and service is slow (due mainly to the preparation of the huge/massive size of food).",

The food is HUGE- quite literally, 1 plate could feed 2-3 people. So, what I would suggest is order a few things with your group and share! My favorite dish is the Grilled French Toast and my hubby loves the Sage Fried Chicken and bacon waffles!",

It presented well but it really is just on a big dish spread out. It has maybe 4 pieces of popcorn shrimp sized bites and was $18.99. Not worth he value. We also ordered the chocolate chocolate waffle. 10 bucks. Its was good. Overall this place is just okay",

    "text": "So I checked this place out last weekend.  It was mad packed with a waitlist and all.  The atmosphere was very boisterous with a full bar , people gathered both inside and outside the door waiting to be seated, as waiters/waitresses zipped through serving patrons.  My wait wasn't that long considering how busy the restaurant was.  I was seated in the bar area at one of the \"high-tops\".  It was fine because I had a great view of the bar, the patio and the front door area.  There wasn't really anything special to see but I still enjoy people watching.  Ok, so I had to order the chicken and waffles everyone raves about.  Must I say, it truly did deliver.  I have to admit that I was a bit awe-struck on just how I was going to attack the towering monstrosity that lay before me.  Needless to say, I had to request a to-go after on eating about 1/3 of my breakfast.    Specifics:   The crunch on the chicken was to die for.  The waffles were very good and I think they would be good with or without being laced with strips of bacon.  The dish comes with a drizzle of syrup which was not enough for me so I requested a side of syrup.  Service was quick and efficient.  Like when asked for a clean fork instead of the one with left over stuck on food that was waiting at the table for me as I sat down.    My order came out way too fast which is always  an eyebrow lifter.  I mean just long was my food sitting under a warming light before it was plated?  Overall, I enjoyed the restaurant and the food (good atmosphere, good food).  I would like to visit again when it is not so busy.",

I wasn't expecting to like it, but I really enjoyed it. The server was friendly and knowledgeable, helping my indecisive a** choose something I would like.  We got a few different things and shared - all were excellent. Massive portions yes, but we took to-go boxes and had food for the next couple of days! Not a downside in my opinion but I do live here - not practical to cart it around if you are vacationing, I'm sure. You could order one appetizer and one entree between two people and it would easily be enough.  Got one of the signature drinks as I have an obsession with collecting souvenir glasses, and this one was awesome - cool, twisted design and good quality REAL glass.   Husband LOVED the place... we will be going back soon.",

    "text": "First off, let me tell you, I have been coming  to Hash House a Go Go for years.  I think their policy on \"no substitutions\" is ridiculous. They will take something out, but will not put anything in, it has to be on the side, with a huge up charge. Supposedly they want to protect their precious recipes. Like adding something the customer wants will make the meal worse? Their portions have gotten smaller, while the prices have gotten bigger.  Our server, Derek L, was the worst server I have ever seen. He was in a rush to get people's orders, and get them out. It's all about turn over for him I guess. Every time we asked for something, it seemed like it was a burden for him to do his job. His personality sucked, he needs better communication and people skills if he wants to make good tips in this business. My water  cup was filled with all ice and never refilled. My mother's endless coffee was also never refilled and when she asked for a to go cup, he responded \"I suppose I can get that for you\" brought it to the table and said \"I am supposed to charge you for that, but since I already dropped off the check...\"  How can you charge again for coffee if it's endless? I hope those that read this realize there are much better restaurants out there that will be more than happy to substitute and give friendly serve with out the high cost.",

    "text": "I'll be honest. While the rest of my party who went here may not have liked what they ordered, I loved the food.   We went here because the driver of the other car, who was the organizer of the trip, saw it on tv on Drivers, Dine-Ins, and Dives, and said it looked good.   We arrived in Vegas and set about finding this restaurant based on general directions from the other driver. Honestly, if you're not paying attention to the signs on the right side of the road (heading eastbound on Sahara) you can easily miss this location. The location opens at 730, and we arrived here at about 6am. We pretty much spent an hour and a half sleeping in the car.   The menu is simple, however it would do good to have photos of all that you would be ordering. What you may not realize when you first come to this restaurant is that the portions are very generous.   What I mean by this is that two of our people ordered a pancake combination. When you order pancakes, you think that they'd be like IHOP pancakes or like McDonald's hotcakes, but this thing, according to the server, was about the size of a medium pizza. He sure as hell wasn't kidding! I mean, that thing was the size of a newborn! Two people shared one of the pancake platters, and the other person gave up on eating the pancake without eating it. (I wolfed the whole thing down in about two minutes for him)   Two other people ordered a Hash House combination plate, which I believe was hashed potatoes and some green pepper and sausage pieces. One ate most of it, the other person finished only a small portion of it, and shared with the rest of the people on our side of the booth.  My coworker ordered a waffle platter, and finished only one corner of a waffle and part of his hashed potatoes. He saved the rest in case we were hungry later on in the day.   The driver of the other car ordered what I believe was Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. When it came out, it looked about the size of a small child's head. The chicken portion that I cut through (to get a bite) was boneless and covered in a delicious sauce. With my help and the help of some of the other people on the table, we finished a little under half of the platter.   The item that I ordered was the One Pound Hash House Mushroom and Swiss Stuffed Burger with a side of Fries. When the burger came out, It was a lot bigger than I thought it would be. The hamburger patties had the swiss/mushroom mixture oozing out of the middle, and it pretty much dwarfed the hamburger bun. It came with the fries, about four fried spaghetti sticks, and around the plate, there was this caramel type texture sauce. Even with the help of three other people, we only managed to eat under half of the burgers.   The restaurant began to get much more busier by the time we left, as more persons were beginning to come in to eat the food. The server was very pleasant and came by pretty often to check up on us.   The next time i go up there, i'm definitely going to stop by here and put myself into another food coma. De Licious!!",

Our dishes came out one by one taking over 15 minutes to get them all.  A drink ordered soon after we sat down came almost 10 minutes after we got our dishes. We had to ask for butter for bread and asked several times for hot sauce before we got it.  The waiter was nice and apologetic, but still it doesn't make up for the forgetfulness and mismanagement of time.    The food is just about being generous, I would rather have quality over big portions.  Don't ask for a substitute you won't get it.  Potatoes and a biscuit is just too much starch for me...an additional slice of melon was denied.  I will no longer take my out of town guest here to give them that \"local dining\" feel.",

    "text": "This was bookmarked on my yelp for a long time and finally had a chance to go this past weekend. We got there and waited about 40 minutes for a table.   We got seated and ordered their specials. I had the Michigan special which was chicken sausage with mixed vegetables and 2 eggs. My friend got the pumpkin-peanut butter flapjack. I also ordered their special cherry lime soda.   I got my soda and it was just okay...it was refreshing, but not worth the money as it just felt like syrup added to it. I thought it be made with bits of lime or cherry or something.   The food finally arrived and it was just ok. My Michigan special was healthy looking, but there was nothing special about it. It was like a fajita with a 2 egg on the side. The flapjack tasted more like pumpkin and not much peanut butter. It was flapjack that covered the whole plate.   The best thing was their home made peach marmilade on the table with their homemade biscuit.  The marmilade was just so great with chucks of peach in it.  I wished they sold it because it was that good.  It was just not memorable to me. I prefer Egg & I - check it out.",

We went on a Sunday Maybe a BIG mistake cause there was sooo many people waiting in line. We didnt wait long which was good. Our Waitress could have used a pick me up because she just was not all there. Bad service. Now on to the food, I had the Apple and Cinnamon Flapjack, WOW it was big and very good, the apples just made the whole thing taste like a piece of apple pie, and I couldn't finish it. The Fiance has the Lumberjack (I think that is what it's called) it came with eggs, potatoes and a buttermilk flapjack. The food was great but the service could use some work. I will definitely come back when I'm in Vegas in a few months.",

    "text": "Just visited Hash House for the fourth time this past Tuesday. Has become one of my favorite restaurants to visit on a regular basis. However, this is my first review. Right away you would think, wow 4 visits must mean that I am going to give it 5 stars. Nope. Sorry to let you down there. So here it goes.  1. Food - Love, love, love the menu! They have a great selection of \"twisted\" farm foods that will have your mouth watering. The presentation of the food, although sometimes a bit over the top, is crazy and interesting and has not heard anything short of \"Wow\" from the people I have gone with. I have tried a few different items from the menu, my favorite so far being the Hash House Meatlof with Pasta. On this most recent visit I had their version of Chicken Pot Pie and it was big on the WOW factor but a bit short on the flavor and taste. The first meal from here I can honestly say I was a bit disappointed in. The veggies needed some seasoning and the weird hat pie crust thing (don't know how else to describe it) was almost a bit stale and really difficult to eat.  2. Service - have had no problems here. Nothing to rave about or complain about.  3. Atmosphere - pretty relaxed and calm nothing too exciting. I did enjoy eating outside on the patio when the weather was nice.  4. Drinks - had to use this just to mention how amazing the Strawberry Lemonade is. I haven't tried anything else because I can't stop drinking this stuff. MMMmmm... I might have to stop in and get a to-go cup now.  To be quite honest, I'm not sure why I keep going back so much. There are places cheaper with just as good quality food. But the portions are HUGE, the prices are fair for a good restaurant and I always am finding coupons to go.",

I had the eggs benedict hash with bacon and spinach.  It also had the red bell pepper cream sauce.  That sauce is just wonderful.  It's a new restaurant so it has a few kinks to work out.  The first time I was there the service was fast and efficient.  The second time I went it was slow and no one took our order or gave us water for 20 mins.  It was affordable and very filling.

    "text": "I don't know what other people are eating here, but this is definitely not a 4* establishment...it was a borderline 2.5* for me and my group...especially after it made us waste 45 mins of our time, which made us sit in horrendous post-Thsnkgiving traffic and we ended us missing our flight. YIKES  Our group of 8 decided to stop by for an early b'fast before hitting the road and driving back to LA where we were to catch an evening flight. I mean, really, we left an 8 hour buffer for a typically 4 hour drive...but alas, it took us 8.5 hours to get to LAX and we missed our flight. And to top that off, the Food @ Hash House was NOT worth missing the flight for.  Because we got there at 8.50a, there was barely a line. In fact, the restaurant was only half filled. Phew.   I was excited to be here since Hash House  has been ALL Over Food Network and my foodie friend liked the Fried Chicken and Waffles (which was kinda a theme for me this weekend)  So i ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles - Fried Chicken- Breast meat only. I was 'assured' by my friend that it was brined and so it should be juicy.  NOT.  The chicken was dry and the skin was tasteless and soggy. It was hard to compare it with Roscoe's, which I happened to have just tasted the day before.  - Waffles- The waffle was WAY too cakey and doughy. It Looked like a waffle but tasted like a fruitcake stuffed with bacon and drenched with some sweet nastiness and bits of fruits. Seriously. Each Large  'quarter' of waffle was stuffed with a strip of bacon, which i normally would have loved...but it didn't add anything to the waffle/ fruitcake.   The presentation was certainly impressive and HUGE. But i don't need a huge serving. I need a TASTY serving.   Our server was very nice though and attentive. The 2 stars were for her...not the food.   I will definitely not be back...the overly huge portions were also a turn-off. That's really saying something for someone like me who actually likes to eat. But a huge portion of nastiness is just a waste of ingredients.",

I found a couple small bones in the salmon which didn't totally put me off, just a little bit. I think it was the lack of flavor that did it, really. Everything tasted bland. The GF wasn't a big fan of her hash. I've seen it mentioned on here a few times, and she agrees, the chicken was very dry.   All in all, we're not fans and I doubt we'll be going back.

I loved that my side of fresh fruit ( I ordered extra because I wanted more than the two pieces) wasn't the ordinary grapes, etc. you'll find at most places. No, here you get fresh pineapple, huge orange slices, strawberries and such that have all been ripened to perfection. :D The staff was friendly, too.

The hash plates are solid and (being I like sweet breakfast) the french toast and pancakes are also good.  Go to Hash House a GoGo for a large breakfast with a large bloody mary and expect to pay a very reasonable bill when you're done.  Is it the best breakfast ever?  no.

I split the banana brown sugar pancake with my husband. HEAVENLY. Nothing compares.  The caramelization on the bananas and the surprising brown sugar bits in the batter were nothing short of spectacular.  Might I say that the batter itself without the bananas and sugar was also delicious. Eat here! You won't regret it.

If you know me you're probably saying to yourself \"Are you kidding me, your the Big Daddy of going big with food\".  If I'm cooking I go big because I want left overs, If I'm paying for it I'd like to feel satisfied without gorging myself.  But this place gets it, I couldn't imagine you doing a Fried Chicken Hash with a wing and tenderloin, it wouldn't work.  I love how there were layers to my breakfast and everything worked together, there wasn't something out of place.  I love the presentation, shows the commitment to quality.  For an off strip location this place just became one of my favorite breakfast spots, can't wait to try it for dinner--Chix and Waffles I hear you calling my name...",

    "text": "Experience:  Came with my friend who has never eaten here. It was a Friday night around 8:30pm.    Facility:  The Hash House restaurants have a cool, country vibe with a modern twist. That is the theme of their food too. The place is always clean and has a spacious feel. They have both tables and chairs and some booth seating. It was only about 30% full since it was a tad late. I like this location, because it's pretty much all locals and not heavy with tourists.   Service:  Shane was our waiter.  He was super nice and very helpful, as it took is entirely too long to decide what we wanted. We probably asked him about 50% of the menu and he never once showed irritation or impatience. Then when I got a bit picky and REALLY wanted corn with my meal, he coordinated a special substitution with the cook.   Food: They switched from Coke products to Pepsi!  Yuck!!!!   Other than that, I really enjoyed the food. They serve hot biscuits with butter and a fantastic house made peach jam.  CHICKEN FRIED STEAK: 4/5 This was on one of their special side flyers. The steak was big, thick, and had a delicious crispy batter. I got the gravy on the side, because I like the crispness of the batter to last. The gravy was good, but a tad bland. I prefer a heavier sausage flavor to my country gravy.  It normally comes with green beans and mashed potatoes, but I asked the sweet corn mashed potatoes that has corn in it instead. I really love corn with my chicken fried steak...this wasn't exactly the same, but it was a nice gesture anyway. The green beans were very good too. They were fresh with a nice seasonings.   Overall:  These restaurants will always be a steady go to for comfort food. They have big portions and great service.  I will be back!!!",

This was a little off the strip but nonetheless was worth NO wait.  I wanted to pack my other half to go, but like I said the boys wanted my meal, so there it went.  Bye, Sage Fried Chicken!  All the meals are too big to fit into my periphery.  For an ant, it would seem like each plate spanned from wall to wall.  Very trendy place, very polite service.",

The coffee is by far, out of this world, no espresso shots needed. The food is in large portions and outstanding in presentation and flavor.  There is a full bar, they have so many drinks to choose from.",

The restaurant has a classic vibe to it, and the service was nice okay, they didn't refill our drinks, until we flagged the waitress down and asked for refills.  The food here is good, unhealthy... But very tasty lol. The start you off with honey biscuits that are really good, but in my opinion too big.  For the entree I got the corned beef hash and my girlfriend got the fried chicken Benedict. The corned beef hash was good! But be prepared for a mountain of potatoes on the side. I liked the fried chicken Benedict more, it was soooo good.  All in all large quantity of comfort style food for very reasonable prices, definitely recommend trying this place out",

On my trip to Vegas, decided to try this place, to see what the buzz was all about.  My husband and I visited on a Wednesday morning, restaurant was partially full, and we were seated right away.  Our server was waiting on a large party, so our service was a bit slow.  The menu is huge, but we each opted for the 2 egg breakfast.  Our food arrived, and I was personally underwhelmed.  The portions are huge, but nothing really stood out for me.  I received 2 pieces of bacon, 2 eggs, potatoes and a huge biscuit.  I really wanted butter for my biscuit, while it was still sorta warm, but our server was attending to the large party and my breakfast grew cold and my coffee cup was empty, while waiting.  When we were finally able to flag her down, I did ask for fresh biscuit and an extra order of bacon, the 2 small pieces included, just didn't cut it.  My husband was undewhelmed as well.  Not sure that I would return.",

There are a few locations around Vegas, and even one that recently opened up in the Rio if that's closer to you. I heard a lot about this place and their portion sizes, that's what everyone always raves about, and that got me interested. When I got there with my family, I could just see the large plates they served their food on. Their food was looking really intimidating before I actually sat down with my food, but I quickly learned it wasn't so bad.  The menu isn't too complicated at all, they have a decent selection of food that can fit the taste of many different people. If you aren't a big eater, I would recommend sharing with someone else, but if you have a big appetite, you should be ok with finishing one dish by yourself.",

Over $64 for breakfast just rubs me the wrong way.  To be fair, you pay for what you get, which is good food, artfully presented, and large portions. Additions like sprigs of rosemary and fried leeks increase the fancy factor of the food, but didn't make me feel better handing over my money and filing a to go container with food that I knew would not be as good the next time I saw it.",

My food great but My wife's food had a pesky fly walk all over, wouldn't fly off. So we told Omar and while we took the plate to replace the food, he wasn't empathetic in the least bit. In fact, approximately 5 minutes after bringing the replacement plate of food he just assumed that we wanted nothing else and brought our bill to the table. So I put my payment card in the bill and tip folder and I handed it to him. When he returned it for my signature he oddly placed the folder on the opposite side of the table at the furthest edge from me. As a waiter or a customer this would seem like customer service 101, perhaps I'm reading too far into it. I'm not going to call and complain I just simply won't be back to any Hash house ago go locations.",

    "text": "This review update is not for the actual restaurant, but for their Thanksgiving Dinner To-Go.  Thanksgiving was held at my house this year.  Instead of spending X amount of hours preparing, cooking, and stressing, I chose to order my turkey from Hash House.  The food here is good so picking the Hash House was a no brainer.   Hash House Thanksgiving Dinner (To-Go):  Cost $98.99.   -Deep Fried Turkey (8-10 lb):  My first deep fried turkey.  Initially thought it was small since I'm use to a 15+ pounder for Thanksgiving.  When it came down to it, it was enough to feed 9.  Turkey was good and surprisingly juicy.  Only issue, no leftovers.  -Garlic Mashed Potatoes (32 oz):  Real stuff, non of that powder Idaho Spuds that you get in the box.    -Pumpkin Mashed Potatoes (32 oz):  Tested by most of us, but we didn't enjoy it as much as the Garlic Mashed Potatoes. My opinion, pumpkin dosen't mix well with traditional mashed potatoes.   -Cornmeal Stuffing (40 oz):  My favorite during Thanksgiving has always been the stuffing.  Throw some gravy on it and it's perfect.  Huge servings.   -Fresh Creamed Corn (16 oz):  So good and wish this was bigger.  Family killed it on the first round.   -Buttermilk Biscuits:  6 huge pcs and I mean huge.  Biscuits on Steroids!!    -Snickers or Pumpkin Pie (6 pcs):  I chose the Snickers, which was a mistake.  Don't get me wrong, it was sweet and delish.  But pumpkin pie shouldn't be replaced during Thanksgiving.  My bad and ended up going to Smiths to get one.    Other trimmings that I didn't include was their baby carrots, cranberry sauce, strawberry jam, and gravy.    Obviously, there's some prep and cook time needed on Thanksgiving day.  Along with the meal comes detailed instructions.  When I say detailed, I mean detailed to the time it takes and what you should cook in order.  If I can follow the instructions, anybody can.   Nothing beats a home cooked meal and I know this.  This year I wanted a stress free Thanksgiving.  You get a lot for $98.99, but most importantly you will be able to spend more time relaxing with family over cooking all night.   Overall, I give Hash House 4 stars for making me look like the Master Chef this Thanksgiving Day.",

The place gets busy, we went on a Sunday so it was packed. The bar (section attached to bar) is first come first serve. Bar tables are not, which is a bummer but it probably because they get so busy. They also won't seat you unless you have your entire party. Go early otherwise wait can be 45-hour. Service is good, they get really busy so everyone is just working and working. I still give it a 5 based on quality of food.",

Order any entree and it will be enough for two.  It is a literal mound of food on a plate.  I love the fried chicken and waffles here.  The chicken is dusted in some rosemary giving it a nice herb flavored crust.  The batter is not to soft or hard, but has just the right crunch to it.  The waffles are bacon waffles.  How can you not love bacon waffles.  They'll also give you a to go cup for your drink if you ask for it.  That was new to me.  I had a nice Arnold Palmer on my drive back to LA.",

    "text": "The success of Hash House may be directly related to the frequency of hangovers in Vegas. Just the sight of their leaning towers of fried chicken and waffles could cure your hangover faster than IV hydration (which, freakishly enough, is a service you can find easily in Vegas).   Opting for a fork & knife remedy over surgical needles, our experience at Hash House was thoroughly therapeutic, and still very Vegas-y. The ambiance is not much different than your local Denny's: big booths, neon colored cocktails in tumbler sized glasses, and smiley waitresses. They do have some outdoor seating and a fun 90s playlist in the background, but the real selling point is the MENU.   It'll be hard to order anything but those famous sage-fried chicken & bacon-stuffed waffles everyone is Yelping about. But in case you're anti-poultry or gluten-free, you'll still find something to drool over on their gigantic menu. Homemade biscuits, big salads, scrambles, benedicts, crab cakes, griddled cheese, and meatloaf are all part of the uber-American offerings. Prices are also huge: $18 chicken & waffles, $15 cocktails, for example. But, be wise and share everything. These are party portions, and you've had enough of that.   Shout out to our waitress who was SO cool, and happily split our check 4 ways without an inkling of annoyance. And hooray for fresh grapefruit & pineapple mimosas for $7... because quitting cold turkey isn't good for anyone.",

Being more of a gourmet eating person, all of my body cells are rejecting the gigantic portion sizes.  Three of us ordered some lunch today. 1.) chicken salad sandwich with house salad/mango dressing.  Tasted very fresh, just the way BF likes it. 2.) corned beef sandwich with house salad/cucumber dressing. Tested great, according to friend. 3.) First I wanted to eat some blueberry pancakes, but smelling good smells from kitchen, I changed my mind. Asked for Classic Eggs Benedicts, but they were out of Hollandise sauce. Well, okay ... then I ordered Corned Beef sandwich with sweet potato fries.  My sweet potato fries were so greasy, I couldn't touch them. Waitress offered to bring me a SURE GOOD  macaroni and cheese side dish.  I really appreciate that she was trying to makeup for the greasy sweet potato fries.  Honestly, I didn't like the macaroni and cheese either. It was not a usual dish. Big penne pasta with so much cheese ... And the cheese kept sticking to my teeth!    Overall I think this place is way over rated. I'm not sure if I want to come back here soon!",

These portion sizes could feed a small village for a week. These portion sizes are so massive that even your southern grandmother wouldn't dare offer seconds. But we can start with the pre breakfast libations. A delicately spiced Bloody Mary with that petite dill pickle everybody loves and a straw the width of my pointer finger just so you can drink it in under 42 seconds flat and get a buzz going before brunch. Oh and I didn't mention the rum Puerto Rican coffee with whipped cream and dulche de leche billowing over the edge of the glass just like the muffin top you're about to have. I got the sage fried chicken eggs Benedict tower. Yep that's right. As seen on Man vs. Food. I had never felt such empathy and jealousy at the same time. It truly was man versus food. It was a trial. I was tested. The food sweats were real. This dish was the worst best thing that has ever happened to me. Did I feel like a quitter? Maybe. But with flavor like that it really was me that came out on top. If you need a hungover brunch in Vegas or you wanna eat until you feel like dying? A must go in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "The food itself was great. It was a late minute decision to come here due to the fact that my favorite restaurant was close on Sunday's.   I ordered the chicken and waffles and ate 2/3 of it. The chicken was very moist to my surprise! And the waffles with bacon went well with the chicken. My friend ordered the Andy's sage fried chicken Benedict. She was nowhere close to finishing!   Reasons for the two star deduction is basically customer service: A) When we entered the young female in the front took a long time to figure out that there were customers waiting on her. And when we asked for an outside seating she said it will take 10 minutes. But her co-worker behind her says a table was ready for us. She seemed confused as we followed the guy to our outdoor seating. So communication on their part needs to be fixed.   B) Our food came out in an orderly time (around 10 minutes) which wasn't bad for the humongous portions we were given. HOWEVER, the servers were sloppy when they handed us our plates. The First Lady brought in my friends plate first and clumsily lays it in front of her. As the plate dropped and the server turned, an orange slice slipped off the plate and landed on my friends lap. I've never seen anyone so careless in putting a plate down a table.   Another different lady came in with my plate minutes after that and the presentation was just not pretty. The fried sage was literally hanging off the plate when I saw it coming. That's my biggest pet peeve because either they don't care about the way it looks (I doubt it since all of their food looks spectacular) or they are just overall clumsy.   C) Lastly, the lack of customer interaction was just not there. I guess that's it's perks of being outside? After I got my check it took them a good 10 minutes to finally come back and check up on us.   Even though my first experience here was rocky, I know I'll be back soon to hopefully redeem this great restaurant. Till next time.",

Sometimes they have great soups and some great dishes.  -Their breakfast is also great.  Again, huge portions.  They also have fresh jam, which I personally appreciate.    -Their dessert is also to die for (try the Snickers bread pudding, the impending diabetic coma will be worth it, I promise).    Cons: -Sometimes, the wait can be a little long.  Beware if you attempt to have breakfast on Sunday.  If you choose to do so, either arrive early or be prepared to wait.    -The service can be a bit inattentive sometimes due to the size of the restaurant.  Our servers have always been friendly, but it can sometimes be hard to get their attention.  I overlook this because the food is so damned good.  If you are visiting, try it!  I always take my friends here that are visiting, and everyone has loved it so far.",

We were a large group of 14 about 11-11:30 on a Sunday with no reservation. LOL  Yeah.... just happened that way. (if my mom organized it, it wouldn't have!)  Well our server totally couldn't handle it!  Now we are not the complaining type and we certainly knew that we had thrown them off on an already busy Sunday Morning and we were having a good time with our Bloody Mary's and Mimosa's and I am sure there were some other drinks in there but anyway....  My feeling on this is If they made room to accommodate us then they probably should have known to give us a server or two that could manage it and have the other servers pick up additional tables. (I have worked in restaurants and this should be a no brainer) especially with the amount of staff that was present!  She was so frazzled that when several of us had requested tortillas instead of muffins or toast and our breakfasts came out with rolls; we reminded her that we had requested tortillas she asked for all of our rolls back! Really?!?!?!? For What?!??! Is she gonna drop them off at another table?????  Not that we wanted the rolls but really, you want it back?!?!?!?  She did either rethink this or was told no because when she came back to the table she didn't want it anymore.  THANK GOODNESS!  Of course we have and will continue to go back. But never as a large party on a Sunday Morning without a reservation! Unless of course we have a few Bloody Marys or Mimosa's before hand!  LOL",

    "text": "Definitely a place to go if you are uber hungry, and with quantity ALSO comes quality at this establishment.  I have gone to the Hash House in San Diego many times, mostly for breakfast and once for lunch, but I gotta say although this one is so distant, it still has the same standard of quality.  It may SEEM pricy, but for the portions you get (enough for maybe 1-2 other meals), it's worth it.  For Dinner our first night on a week long road-trip, we stopped by Vegas to try this place out.  I had the Boston Hash- the crab cakes were pretty tasty- the only other kind I have to compare it to is the one from Rainforest Cafe (EWWWW!!) and Fisherman's wharf in San Francisco (specifically Sabella and Torre- deLish!)  But the breakfast that takes the cake here is the Crispy Hand hammered pork tenderloin benedict.  The pork is just bursting with flavor and the creamy benedict sauce really complements it really well :)    I requested Jam for the huge biscuits that usually come with the entrees, and although they don't have any in the evening, the server was able to find some that was saved from the morning (Thank you!!).  It was strawberry preserves, and although it was really good, the BEST is the fresh fruit one made with blueberry/strawberry/peaches.  I commend them for their excellent service, and hope they perhaps open one in Nor Cal ;)",

    "text": "Well. Where can I start? First let's go with the name of this place. Hash House A Go Go. Just brilliant alliteration. Sounds fun and tasty, but this isn't some regular breakfast type diner. It's a full scale restaurant with clean decor and a wonderful vibe inside. However, be careful what you order because the servings are HUGE! I mean, if you eat a whole plate by yourself you might just turn into a bad after school special and find yourself praying to the porcelain god kinda huge. Then you will start to feel ashamed for how much yummy you just indulged. So good you might as well just show up with a funnel to manage shoving the food into your face faster kinda good. Now, I can't go there too often because there are enough calories in any dish that I have to chain myself outside a city bus and just keep running for the next month. But if you are looking to have a cheat day or cheat meal, check out Hash House a Go Go. Don't eat the day of or the day before because you will want to try everyone's dishes! Oh Tip: Wear loose fitting clothes and 2+ can share a plate easy. Not the best for a date, but you should definitely bring friends and embrace your inner chunky!!",

My wife had the avacado burger. She asked for it without a bun - all that to say the beef patty was 8-9\" wide!  My rib eye special ( came with a stuffed crab cake) was delicious and cooked to perfection as was her burger.  Great staff and a warm apmosphere.",

Which was a good sign, at first. After a brief wait, we sat down and looked at our menus. When the waitress first came over we ordered speciality coffee drinks. In the meantime we continued to look at the menu. Once we were ready we put the menus to the side and started talking. I noticed that people next to us had ordered and just gotten their food while we were sitting there and we had still to order and get our drinks. 15 minutes goes by and our waitress finally takes our orders. Meantime the other couple is finishing up their meal we have still to receive either part of our meal. Another 10 minutes, our waitress comes over to tell us the coffee bar is backed up. 25 minutes? of not receiving our drinks? How hard is it to make a coffee drink and add a little flare on the side? Anyhow, my drink comes first, by itself. Then our food, then 5 minutes into our food, his drink.  Seriously? Maybe you could let us know before we order them that we won't get them for 30 minutes.  No matter how good the food was the service was awful. I don't think we will ever go back. Mid-meal we asked for waters and that took 10 minutes alone, I eventually had to stand up and ask another waitress. No thank you.  Hash House A No No.",

    "text": "A solid 3 but I'm glad I got to experience it. Maybe the food was just ok because we were their last table before they closed before dinner service.   The way Adam on Man vs Food made this place definitely a need to go in my book. There were not enough oh my's or yums coming out of my mouth as I watched the episode. So a few weeks before my trip to Vegas, I bookmarked it on Yelp because it was a must go. I told everyone about it and showed pics from my bro in laws experience. I felt like it was going to be a magical moment.   Michelle L. and I got there at 2:25P.. and we had to wait for our other 2 friends. We were told we couldn't be seated until they arrived AND they were closing the door in 5 minutes. My friends got a few calls asking where they were and I felt like I was going to miss out on my magical eating moment. But luckily they showed up with a minute to spare.   As we scanned the menu, there were many things that made me go oooh. But this is what I went with...  Smores Mocha - Not usually a warm mocha person but it was just ok. If they crumbled up some graham crackers on top it might have made it more memorable.   Andy's Sage Fried Chicken w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit - Tasty but the fried Chicken was a bit dry. I drizzled some of my friends maple syrup on it to give it a little more character.   We didn't wait long for our food as many others said. We were told that their food prep area is as big as their tables that are in the restaurant and after the Man vs Food episode, the restaurant became extremly popular.  Hence the reason for the slow service at the peak hours. I'm just saying what our waiter told us (he was really friendly).  A few tips:  - Don't over hype your expectations before coming  - Our waiter told us that they are opening a location at the Imperial Palace  - Come a little closer to 2:30 in the afternoon - Hey your in Vegas, the town that never sleeps :)  Other than that I have no complaints, just happy that I got to experience it. I really cant be mad with that much food on my plate.  End of story.",

A weekend in Vegas with fellow Yelpers K-Fed and Teem, my good friend who just moved to LV, Cheska took us here. She raved about this place since we got into town late Friday night and we were here for Sunday lunch. I can honestly say, why in the world didn't we come here sooner?!?!   This place is modern, with a little country thrown in. I mean, they even serve beer out of a bag!! The music they play is an interesting mix as well. One second you'll hear No Doubt, another, you're hear some hiphop. I'm liking the mixture!  On to the food, I ordered a apple smoked bacon & mashed potato one pound stuffed burger. They basically sandwich the bacon and mashed potatoes in-between two patties!! This thing was so thick, they had a steak knife stuck in the middle of it with the entire blade unseen!  The burger was surprisingly moist and the bacon and mashed potatoes just put me into an instant (but heavenly) food coma.   I even had some string like fries?, which were OK, but the burger, damn, was a really good burger. My only semi-\"complaint\", how to keep that sucker together. Once I pulled the knife out and took many bites (can't fit it all in my mouth, shut up), the thing fell apart like a stack of dominoes.   My other foodies in tow, decided on breakfast (which looked just as good). The servings are VERY generous and the pricing just right for what you get. Quality AND quantity. The service was right on as well. I can't wait, maybe next time we'll come for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.",

It shouldn't take 45 minutes to bring out a breakfast. The scrambled eggs should be edible. It shouldn't take an act of Congress to get a refill of a cup of coffee. Or some cream. Or some syrup.   And the final straw was the argument with the waiter. I don't eat fruit. It's my quirk. My cross to bear. I get that. That's why I read the menu and order accordingly. So when I order the basic because it is the only thing that doesn't come with fruit, and then it comes out with pineapple on my bacon and biscuit. I'm not happy. The correct response from the waiter is not \"read your menu\" and \"if you aren't allergic what's your problem.\"  If I hadn't been with a group, we would have had a scene and I'd have walked out.",

The concept of the restaurant seems good (looks like a lot of famous people go there by the wall pictures). But the execution lags. I was shocked by the total mess the bathroom was, paper everywhere including random rolls, like an employee left midway. ???",

    "text": "Breakfast on 'roids. Deconstructed food that look like they require psychiatric treatment. Dishes that look like they were plated by a mad scientist. Invariably, these are all sufficient descriptions to add to their self-proclaimed \"Twisted Farm Food\" nickname.  This place is known for their oversized portions and unique interpretations of classic dishes, especially for breakfast or brunch. It's off the beaten path from the bright lights of the Strip, but if you're tired of the same cookie-cutter and overhyped food there, you may want to check this place out.  After the drive into Vegas, we were all starving and we ended up eating here for a late dinner. Plus, we had a $50 gift cert from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> that's only good for dinner, so that helped influence things. At first glance, the menu is mightily expansive. Everyone ordered all types of food, including chicken pot pie, salads, crab cakes and swordfish. The pot pie was especially a sight to behold. The crust resembled a UFO that had just crash landed on a planet full of chopped-up chicken and veggies.   I settled on the sage fried chicken, which was accompanied with a waffle tower that has smoked bacon incorporated inside, drizzled with hot maple caramel syrup. There's something about eating a dish with a huge knife smack dab in the middle, standing upright, holding all of the bits and pieces of your food together.   The dish was flanked by two huge fried chicken breasts, and when I took my first bite, it was nothing I had ever tasted before. Immediately, I tasted the hint of the sage herb throughout the meat, then the sweetness of the maple syrup on the fried outer crust from the skin. I must admit, although the white meat was juicy and tender, I wished I had a dark meat thigh or leg to gnaw on too.  The bacon-infused waffle was delicious, crispy on the outside, warm and fluffy on the inside. After eating two chicken breasts, I could only finish off a couple pieces of the waffle. I was more than stuffed. Plus, my taste buds were getting numb from the sweetness of the dish. It's a good thing I'm in Vegas, there was plenty of night left to burn it off. And if this were a Man vs. Food challenge, I would obviously sigh and agonize in defeat.  But no matter, I know for a fact that I would want a rematch in the near future. A different dish, perhaps one of their signature house hashes or farm scrambles. After all, they do have a location in SD, far closer to me than in Vegas. For now, I can carry out my leftovers in my gigantic doggie bag with my head held high.",

    "text": "It was nice to get away from the bustle of the Vegas strip to come try Hash House a Go Go for brunch. The wait took around an hour for the 5 of us since it was pretty darn busy on a Saturday afternoon. We just sat around and admired all the autographed menus lining the entry way. Their menu had an incredible selection too! I think I would have had trouble deciding if my friend Marti L. hadn't already suggested a dish that sounded delish.  Andy's sage fried chicken meal ($13.95 and $2.50 extra to split the dish) - OMG!! The portions were humongous! No wonder HH was featured on Man vs. Food before. haha The prices are totally worth it if you share the dish with one or 2 other people. My faves were the bacon mashed potatoes and fresh baked biscuit. The chicken didn't taste of sage at all to me and a was a little dry...there wasn't enough maple reduction but was fried to perfection! (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=rOcMiMAsg_K3yC-aOPggPA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/g8On...</a>)  I sampled the kiwi/watermelon lemonade (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=AvvDoT4CdKsnfcCSUuy5vg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/g8On...</a>) which looked pretty and was really tart just the way I like it. I also tried the bacon waffles which were to die for! (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=AvvDoT4CdKsnfcCSUuy5vg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/g8On...</a>) The batter was soft/chewy and the bacon complimented it very well. The food took around 20 min to come out but it was well worth the wait! Our waitress was dressed like the Chiquita banana lady too. lol  Fun meal and great, affordable food!",

    "text": "We joined our out-of-town guests for breakfast this morning, and we figure Hash House A Go Go would be the perfect place.  There was absolutely no wait on a Thursday morning at 8:30 am, but two hours later, there is definitely a wait!  * Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato & fresh spinach Hash ($11.25) - The hashes \"are tossed with crispy potatoes and topped with 2 eggs, served with fresh fruit and biscuit.\" Two sunny side up eggs sat in the corner of my skillet along with a large biscuit and a generous portion of potatoes and other good stuff.  I ate it all up, sadly enough, minus the biscuit.  And yes, I am still full from my breakfast.  It's a hearty portion alright! I even managed a couple of nibbles of the biscuit with the jam provided on the table.  * Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict \"w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream & scrambled eggs\" ($14.95) - The Husband was looking for the item that was featured on the Travel Channel's Man v. Food, and the waitress said it was this one.  All of their benedicts are \"served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes.\"  It was a huge pile of something with creamy sauce dripping all over it.  I took a bite, and in retrospect, I don't think I tasted anything beyond the fried chicken and cream sauce!  I did see the generous scrambled egg resting on top of the chicken though!  The Husband did box up the other half since it is such a generous order though.    * Andy's famous Bread pudding topped w/ ice cream and served w/ a cup of coffee ($7.95) - The waitress said the only bread pudding they offered was the Snickers one.  I don't recall a Snickers bread pudding on the menu, and this one didn't taste like there was any Snickers in it.  No cup of coffee arrived with it either.  It was good though.  Service was okay, water glasses were refilled in a timely manner. We thought she forgot about our dessert since it was taking longer than usual.  But I think that's when it was busy in the kitchen, so that could explain the lag time.  Overall, Hash House A Go Go is the place to be at for big breakfasts.  (Looking back at my other review, I had a much better experience before!)  3.5 stars",

This last visit was for my mother's birthday and I must say that I had no complaints and there was enough leftover for me to take with me for lunch at work.  Pros:   *  Generous portions for the hungry   *  Really good customer service (this is important to me)   *  Quality food and decently priced   *  They quoted me a 30 minute wait, but it was actually quicker than that.  Cons:   *  If you like embarrassing a birthday celebrant, don't bring them here.  No singing.   *  busy busy busy so expect a wait.    Overall:   Okay so there was a wait (there is always a wait), but I guess that's a good sign right?  One thing is for sure, they have some enormous portions.  So big in fact that Man Vs. Food's Vegas episode actually came to this location to feast.  Don't mistake quality for quantity here.  The portions are grand ,but the taste is just as amazing.    Tips:   *  If you share, make sure to order an extra side, otherwise they automatically charge you an extra $2 dollars.  Might as well get something extra since you're going to pay for it either way right?     *  Try some of their specialty drinks.  I forgot the exact name of my favorite, but it comes with a watermelon wedge dangling off the edge of the glass.  Spectacular!  *  Come hungry... Seriously!  And don't come if you are in a rush.  Especially not during Brunch on a weekend",

We didn't wait long to get a drink. After we were served our food no one came back to ask if everything was okay. I had the rancheros dish and my husband the crab cake sandwich. The food was good. However, I had to wait 8 to 10 minutes for the waitress to come back, then I was able to ask for a side of sour cream. She took about 10 minutes to come back. My husband asked for a refill and never got one. When she came back with my sour cream I was already done. It's a shame the service lacks on very important aspects. They need to be more prompt with refills and asking if things are okay. Otherwise you will wait 10 minutes if not more to get a refill or anything you may need. I don't think I will be back. The food doesn't match the service.",

We got here around 11 and it was really crowded. The wait was about 20-30 minutes but we were seated pretty quickly . Me and my family just got two chicken and waffles and shared it between four people because it is WAY too much just to eat by yourself. I got the strawberry lemonade which was really good and our waitress was great . She got everything we asked for super fast. I was kind of mad tho they they didn't have ranch and two of my waffles were gonna burnt but other than that the chicken was really juicy and good . They can cut back on the sage and other garnish on top cuz I just moved it too the side. I will definitely be back.",

I've only had their sage chicken farm benedict but also had a taste of one of their burgers. Both great options for those who love comfort food that's VERY filling. I also love all the drink options!   Only drawback for me was the last visit I made there: the music was way too loud and I couldn't hear my friend speaking.   This is a fun, unique place with a twist on the usual breakfast favorites. You can't go wrong! I will definitely be making more visits!",

    "text": "Good food and good service but maybe not up to a full five stars.  I keep looking for a way to vary my gluten free meals so I ordered the steel cut oatmeal and a side of bacon.  It was sort of a healthy and not-healthy combination I guess.  The oatmeal came with a \"fruit garnish\" which I thought would be a small dish of grapes and melon.  But the presentation was fantastic.  There was a full split banana, four large strawberries, two melon slices, two orange slices, a dash of blueberries and (I think) blackberries on the oatmeal.  The fruit was fresh and tasty and the oatmeal was very good, especially after pouring on the syrup and brown sugar. More of the not so healthy.  Two out of three of the bacon strips were delicious, but one was somewhat overdone.  My wife ate one of the done-right strips and found it good enough to order her own, repaying me with one of them.  Her main order was a sun dried tomato farm scramble.  She liked it a lot and had more than enough to eat.    They were rather busy and the place was full.  It may have been just this one occasion, but we did find it rather noisy.  And while the service was polite and prompt, and we were well attended, it was by a number of different people, which created a sense that something was missing even though we were never left waiting for anything.",

My mom tried the steak,egg, and potato that they had as a special on Valentine's Day. She tried the tangerine mimosa. Both mimosa's seemed to be lacking something. It was almost as if they were watered down or weakened in some fashion (in the flavor department).   The food, on the other hand, was fantastic. Chorizo can be really oily and rich, but the chorizo hash was well balanced in flavor and not greasy at all. My mom's steak was tender and the eggs were fluffy and cooked just right.  Parking downtown has never really been a breeze, but if you use the valet parking on the side of the Plaza building, you should be fine.",

    "text": "Okay, so I guess I should start by saying that we came for breakfast, first time trying their breakfast menu. They had tons of yummy sounding options, but I settled on a blueberry pecan pancake, over medium eggs, and bacon. My boyfriend got the french toast.  His french toast sounded soo good on the menu description, and when it was served, it looked fantastic, except for the griddled bananas (served in the peel, which was black and mushy, tasted good but very unappealing looking) his french toast tasted like nothing, and was mushy and in general, just kind of blah.  My pancake was HUGE, and yummy, but my over medium eggs were basically raw, I mean the yolks were super runny (which is fine, I never, ever send food back) I was going to eat them until I noticed that the whites werent even cooked, I mean, runny whites on an over medium egg? Yuck! I asked the waitress for new ones and she obliged saying, \"oh sure, you might want more of an over medium.\" Um, yeah cause that's what I ordered. She brings the eggs back out and clearly the cook was annoyed that they got sent back, because he cooked the crap out of these eggs, I mean, they were beyond well done. Whatever, I mean the pancake was so huge I didn't even need the eggs at that point.  Fast forward to them picking up the bill, I was paying by credit, they took the card, and then a different person came back and asked for Id, which I accidentally left at home. (If its your policy to get Id for credit cards, that's fine, but maybe ask for the identification before you run the card?) I explained I didn't have it and instead of offering another option he glared at me and asked if it was really my card. I mean, come on. I said that yes it is my card and he just mumbled something under his breath and walked off! We had cash, and would have paid in cash! To top it off we had to wait another few minutes for them to bring me a pen so I could sign the receipt.  Really? I wanted to love this place, again the menu for breakfast is really enticing. But our general experience was way off.  All in all, I've eaten here a few times (other times for dinner) and in general, they definitely wow you with portion sizes but they lack actual flavor. They describe their food as midwestern farm food with a twist. After eating here a handful of times I'm convinced the twist is the portion size and the giant sprig of rosemary they serve with everything.",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars to be more precise.  I'm sure Hash House A Go Go got a nice surge after being featured on Man vs. Food and the gratuitous plug from Adam Richman (who has one of the coolest jobs in the world by the way).  But me?  I dunno, I'm not overly impressed.  It's kind of middle of the road for myself.  I'm a good eater...and at Hash House A Go Go they do serve BIG FOOD!  Portions are ginormous and meals often come out on platters the size of a small hubcap.  You will almost always leave with a little doggie bag of leftovers!  Alas, for me the flavors of the food doesn't particularly sing to my palette.  It just seems like you're going to a chain restaurant with lots of chain restaurant food, and it all just kinda tastes the same.  Not bad, but not standout great.  When you combine the muted flavors with the high prices I have no choice but to knock you down a star or two.  But perhaps this is my fault.  People rave that this place is a great deal for breakfast, when they showcase the best things to have at Hash House.  I ended up going for dinner so maybe my review is somewhat off-kilter.  But I gotta go off of what we ate, and it pains me to say it but it was all average.  We shared Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower ($18).  I saw pics of this platter online and thought we gotta have that.  In all?  It was ok.  The fried chicken was hot and juicy, but I couldn't get into the batter they dip it in.  It was a tad on the thick side and got in the way of the chicken.  Also, the flavor was just bland, bland, bland.  Not spicy, savory, or sweet like a decent fried chicken.  It was very plain.  The waffles stuffed with whole strips of bacon?  Impressive, but again off in it's flavors.  The smoked bacon was delicious on its own, but the waffle needed some seasoning that the hot maple reduction couldn't offer.  The waffle was nice and crisp and chewy on the inside though like a waffle should be.  We also shared one of Andy's Twisted Stuffed Burgers ($15).  The one we got had roasted beef, smoked mozzarella, and charred tomato in it.  It came out in a HUGE stack which of course made it near impossible to eat.  I had to cut it into tinier portions just to pick it up!  Doing this made my stuffed burger very uneven in the tasting.  I had a hard time getting to meld a bite that included all the fixings in the burger.  And by the time I finally got to eat my burger the juices from the patty made my bottom bun extra SOGGY.  I hate that.  And again, the flavors just seemed subdued somehow.  No zip, no zing, no tang, no mas!  It really just struck me as an average burger.  I've honestly had a better one for less money.  Will this be the first place I suggest use a dash of MSG in their food?  However, the fries were crisp and delicious.   Speaking of sharing...there will be none of it had unless you like being charged for it!  Seriously, you get charged a $4-5 fee if you are sharing one plate.  It seems a bit highway robbery if you ask me...serve me a too large portion of so-so food then punish me if I want to share?  I can see why obesity rates are high in the US.  So your best bet here is to order two plates of food (or an entree and a large side) if you're a couple and avoid that dumb fee altogether.  You will just have more leftovers to take home.    Speaking of leftovers...we left Hash House with 3 (yes 3) containers of food for the ride home!  I indeed ate all I could and left full, but not satisfied.  A few hours later I decided on some of the leftovers for a midnight snack but again was met with the mediocre.  My leftovers didn't hold up well at all!  Fried chicken was soggy (and still bland), and the burger had gone on the rubbery side.  I was too disappointed thinking about throwing away all this food so I ended up eating it anyway.  Not one of my finer moments.  The main reason why I still give a 3 1/2 star here was because of the service.  Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant, and kept our drinks filled without much fuss.  She had some mad strong forearms too, defined!  Must be from all the heavy duty platter lifting going on there.  Hate to say it Hash House A Go Go, but I think if I ever try this place again it will be for breakfast or brunch.  Please work on seasoning your food!  Thanks, k bye!",

The portions are huge, far too much food for me to eat. My hubby loves breakfast and he got this spicy breakfast skillet thing. He showed me pictures to show off the portion size and its kind of ridiculous how large it was, he was proud that he consumed the whole thing. I heard they charge to split plates, I don't like that but my husband wasn't sharing so it didn't apply to him. He wants to take me here next time we are in town. I guess a large breakfast might help cure a hangover so I can imagine this would be a great place to try for several visitors.",

    "text": "Seating: This place has an uppity, progressive/hipster environment with a good build-out and a decent seating arrangement.   Environment: This place attempts to create an oxymoron by juxtaposing two seemingly unrelated things: farm food and cool,young,progressive/hipsters. This kinda seems like they are making a stab at country food and county people by making it into a novelty.   Service: The service (after 3 visits) is hit-or-miss. The environment is that of a hipster, \"cool person\" hang out. A lot of the servers have an alternative look with tattoos and piercings and less than everyday hairdos. So, sometimes the servers act cool and laid-back. This leads to them being slow and unattentive at times because they are too busy being laid back and cool. We ordered coffee three times. Refills were slow every time. If you're a morning coffee person and you're paying $2.25+ for coffee, you expect refills. Although I will say, the coffee here is excellent.  Food: Food is pretty good. Good presentation. Large Portions. Cooked well.  Like I said, it seems like they are attempting to create a menu of  totally exaggerated, larger than life dishes. Fattening, full of butter, oil, and starchy carbohydrates, just like you would eat on a farm (so they think.) However, True country people that grew up on a farm needed all the extra calories because they were working their butts off all day outside. This restaurant plays on the idea of being a country, farmer \"hick\" by hyperbolizing and exaggerating the consumption of high fat, high sugar, \"corn fed\" food.   Overall: I would recommend anyone try this at least once. I'm not all about the cool person, tatted-up, slow service environment. But, if you are, you may enjoy it.",

My wife wanted to order hash, which is why we went to HASH House a Go-Go, as hash is traditionally served with poached eggs, and they only serve it with scrambled eggs with dinner. WHAAAA? So it's okay to have poached eggs for breakfast but not for dinner.  Hmmph.   I had the chicken and biscuits. The gravy was schmeh. Yep, just schmeh. The chicken was tougher than a boiled owl. The asparegus was so tough that I couldn't even cut it with a steak knife. The only good thing about the meal were the biscuits. They were very good.  One of the more disappointing dining experiences I've had in a while. With so much talk about how amazing this place was I expected a lot more. Not a very value friendly place either.

I've always wanted to try the one in San Diego, but could never find parking.  As I passed the Vegas location, I saw it had its own parking lot and decided to give it a try.  The food was great  - - we had the Corned Beef Hash and the basic breakfast.  To back my opening statement, whats known as the \"basic\" breakfast was huge!  I don't know how many eggs were used but suffice to say it was a lot, the ham steak was a very thick cut and of great quality, the mashed potatoes and roasted potatoes were plentiful.  All I can say is you won't be disappointed.  I've said the mantra \"I don't mind paying for quality, just don't skimp on the food\" many times.  That said, you'll find the prices \"a bit up there\"  compared to average breakfast, but Hash House is anything but average.  The quality and quantity is great.  Finally, be warned . . . you'll either leave stuffed to brim, or have a hefty take home bag.  Good eating at the Hash House.",

Went for lunch and had the warm spinach salad.  It was good, but I was definitely the odd man out, as all my companions had things like Pot Pie, Corn Beef, Meatloaf, etc.  Down home cooking at its finest.  The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 was that the service was a bit off.  All of our entrees arrived sporadically (there was about a five minute gap between the first and last served) and one of the people in my party didn't get the soup they ordered.    Nevertheless, I will definitely go back, and am eager to try something off the breakfast menu.",

Other times another host just points to bar and says you can sit there or do u want dinning in a very unpleasant voice like she is over it.....then throws our menus on the table and says all your menus are here and walks away....we also had a server that dropped our check in the middle of our meal and said \"just in case you can't find me\".... really????.....Our other experiences here has been fine where we can deal with it....but hopefully they retrain their staff that just doesn't have any customer service personality.....start with the host first cause they are who we see first and if it is a bad experience I will will think the rest of my experience will be as bad.....",

The waiter appeared just three times: to take my order, bring the food, and bring the check.   I had  the Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower. The chicken was moist with a crunchy coating. The waffles stuffed with bacon was a good idea, but weak on the execution - they were rather dry with no extra syrup on the side. I really liked the unusual  garnishes. Fresh lemonade was perfect - not too sweet.  On a previous visit a year or so ago, I enjoyed the pork tenderloin sandwich. I remember the service being much better at that time.",

    "text": "This is one of my \"miss\" food adventure. Too bad because it was a belated Father's Day brunch for my dad. We still enjoyed it in good spirit, as nothing is direly bad - like fly in the food or we came down with food poisoning - none of that.  What we did though, me and my dad, for a good part of the time spent waiting for our orders was discussing how the decor of the restaurant missed the theme by a ten foot pole. My dad is a professional interior consultant for large scale resorts and casinos with experience more than my age. Anyway, that's probably only for the picky eyes.  I mean, the restaurant is clean, well lighted, good circulation and definitely meet the standard for an \"A\" restaurant.   The Food: I will summarize it in 3 letters abbreviation: T.M.E {Too Much of Everything!!!!!}.  If it is to feed a farm worker who tills the field, rolls the hays, stacks pavements stones and whatever hard-manual-calorie-burning labors a farm worker does, then yes the portion is sufficient. But for a paper pusher, computer staring, sitting on your butt all day, going everywhere with cars folks for whom a distance between 1 parking space closer to the storefront is like a matter of life and death, the portion is a little bit much. I'm being sarcastic. Honestly, the portion is waaaaaaaay too much! Hello, people??? Is the coffee they served not thick enough to wake you up that you can see the mound of food in front of you?? Literally the food was stacked up and jabbed through with a big knife. Cool to see, cringe to think that the plate is for one person... ... I can only roll my eyes as people shovel at least half of the plates into their mouths.  Hey, I like to eat and indulge here and there. Regardless of my size. But this is off the chart.  The taste: Double word: \"so-so\"  (is it considered one word?) Nothing special here, folks, Move along! To quote the description of the stars rating \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" And I have. Plenty times different other places. Does it taste bad? To be fair, not really. Was it excellent? I really won't go that far!   My suggestion if you want to eat here: Treat this place like a family style dining, where you share the food. The more people you have in the party the better.   For example: The specialty flapjacks can serve 4-6 easy. The hash can serve 2 if you don't order anything else, and 4 if you order the pancakes or waffles.   We brought home the flapjack that morning, with the toasts, and we were full all the way until 7:30pm (that was a 10 hour filling breakfast!). Perhaps I should add 1 star for it's economical value? .. Nah :p",

It is definitely attracting loads of people (waited about an hour).  I loved the fun drinks and all the menu choices.  It was hard for me to decide what to order as I saw the waiters delivering all the food around me.  I decided to order the vegetarian hash and couldn't wait for it to be delivered.  However, I was disappointed when the food showed up lukewarm.  The biscuit was cold (biscuits aren't good cold - they should be served HOT).  When I tasted some of my brother's pancake, it was also cold (although he said it was hot when it arrived -- I have a hard time believing that it cooled off that quickly).    I would definitely try Hash House again.  The portions are huge and the is something for everyone to eat here.  But I hope the management will fix the operational issues -- make sure that food is being served HOT, please, (at the very least, heat up the plates/skillets in the oven so food doesn't cool off so quickly).",

I was surprised at how big the place was, it is kind of sectioned off into two difference rooms. I had a simple breakfast with eggs, hash browns, and a biscuit and coffee to drink. The biscuit was so buttery and fresh and warm, and like everything here HUGE. I usually love me some carbs, but I could not finish the biscuit or the rest of the meal. The food was great the prices matched the huge portions, not overprices but accordingly to the amount of food you get. My entree was one of the simpler ones and it was 9 bucks, everything else was above that. Only bad experience was someone straight threw up in there. Was walking aND \"bleeaaaaacgh!\" *splaash*. I was confused as to what happened when I heard it and saw a guy running out, until I saw the horrified look on a puke-splattered woman. I am assuming the patron had a rough night of drinking in Vegas and that it wasn't the food there. Still pretty horrific to witness on your first meal of the day. Final thought :This would be a good spot to pig out in...maybe wear rain gear...?",

There is this obsession with quantity in our culture, and Hash House is the epitome of this obsession.  I was awe struck by the mountains of cooked flesh and grease that was being served all around me.  People were taking pictures of their food (no doubt to post on Yelp).  As I waited for my french toast, I wondered how much of this stuff people cram into their bodies every day.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a health nut.  I could care less really, but even I have my limits.  My french toast with bananas on it tasted awesome for the first few bites.  However, after chewing on this thing for a while, I got bored.  That's right... as big and overblown as the food in this place is, I got bored of eating it.  And this, my friends, is the failing of Hash House A Go Go. :-)",

We had 2 other waitresses help us and ask If we needed anything before she ever got there.  I ordered the 2 egg basic breakfast with turkey sausage which end really chicken sausage but the waitress didn't even tell me that. I asked for it to be well done, well...... the sausage came out not well done and the eggs were very wet still and were not fully cooked. When the waitress came back to the table I asked if she could please take it back and have it cooked well done. Her answer was well I told them to make it well done and then she rolled her eyes and took off to get some plates to transfer my undercooked, underwhelming food back. She should have never rolled her eyes, this was extremely unprofessional and she should have just said no problem let me have that fixed for you.  When I was a waitress we never made it the customers fault although sometimes it could have been. We never put blame on our cooks or anything of the sort. We just pleasantly said let me have that corrected for you!  So the moral of the Story is she gas overwhelmed by how many tables she had which was very obvious, and she should choose a new line of work since she is not cut out for that one.  I will never be back and that was not worth $40 without the tip. Oh and did I mention after all that crappy service my boyfriend decided she should still get a tip even though I complained about giving her one.  Good Luck!  Oh I called the manager to let him know what had happened with the waitress. He thanked me and said he would address it with her.",

    "text": "I'm basing my review on a number of things. My meal, my husband's meal, price, etc.  My husband had the sage fried chicken and waffles. He said they were amazing. They were HUGE, however, and he could only eat about 1/3 to 1/2 of it. Being in Vegas, it's not really feasible to take a to-go box with you. So, half his meal was left behind. I hate seeing all that food go to waste, so I wasn't thrilled about this.  I had the chicken and biscuits. It's served over country style mashed potatoes with delicious gravy. The potatoes, biscuits and gravy were all delicious, however my chicken was super dry. I could have used a LOT more gravy to help out with the chicken. Still, I finished most of it. The portion size was a lot better than the chicken and waffles.   Price was average based on the amount of food we received.   We were far too full, and because it was dinner time, we didn't have any of their coffee drinks which I hear are out of this world. Perhaps next year when we're back in Vegas we'll stop in for a late breakfast instead of dinner.",

Its one of the few places I can say that almost every meal I've had here is a hit.  The prices are decent when you discover that the portions are HUGE.  Beware, you might not finish a meal here.  I've been here countless times, and I've yet to manage to avoid having to take out.  My 2 favorites would have to be either the Chicken Pot Pie or the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict.  Both of which are ridiculously awesome, and both are one hell of a twist on a classic dish.  The Chicken Pot Pie is essentially a deep fried sombrero on some mash potatoes with the \"filling\" poured on top.... Its just magical.    The wait usually is pretty long if you go during the peak hours, ie brunch, lunch, dinner, but its totally worth it.  One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, if not my favorite restaurant in Vegas.  A must go.",

    "text": "Oh. My. God....AMAZING! (If you're coming here, try not to eat for the day because the servings are monstrous!)  I have been to both this location as well as the one in Imperial Palace and would definitely recommend this one by far. (Imperial Palace had equally good food, but MUCH lower quality service). The decor is a bit different for both locations, with the Sahara location being much bigger, livelier, and more attentive service.   As soon as we got there, we ordered. My boyfriend got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and I got the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles....sorry, my mouth started watering just thinking about it.... The wait for our food was unbearable, mostly because waiters were walking by with pancake platters  with pancakes that took up the entire plate (about a foot in diameter)! I ordered a mimosa to ease my nerve. It was okay - too much champagne.   Finally, our food came. Two plates of enormous proportions - my chicken and waffles were the size of my head! It looked really good, though: four bacon waffles, topped with perfectly fried chicken topped with a not-too-sweet maple glaze. (They had to drive a steak knife through it to make sure it didn't topple over). The chicken was tender, but fried in a bit of a spicy batter, which paired with the sweetness of the glaze, waffle, and bacon really well.   Looking at his benedict, though, I had to take a sliver....which turned into half of his plate, haha. It was amazing! A perfect biscuit, topped with sage fried chicken, two eggs, bacon mashed potatoes, and hollandaise sauce. (Oh, and a slice of fruit to be healthy). The flavors came together so well!   We ate so much, our stomachs looked like two balloons ready to burst. It was worth it, though. It's been a week, and I'm having withdrawals.   If you're looking for a GOOD meal or want to be filled for days, or both, then go to Hash House - you won't regret it.",

I finally convinced my family to go during a trip to Vegas for a quick fireworks loaded weekend.  Food is presented as 'twisted farm food' and it's no lie.  The food is hardcore, unique, and massively portioned.  If you get one of their benedicts, or even a pancake or two, I recommend to share amongst at least 2 people.  I had their snickers pancake and their kiwi watermelon lemonade to drink.   The pancake was massive and scattered with half melted nougaty peanuty chocolaty mini snickers.  It was extremely filling and quite good.  It was just what you would think it would taste like, and I could barely finish the entire thing.  The lemonade was quite good... sort of a tangy drink with the mellow aftertaste of watermelon.  My mother had the blackberry granola pancake and it was quite tangy, but very good.  I was with my family so nothing too interesting was had... but many people in the place were getting the various benedicts they offer, and they looked amazing.  The place is a tad expensive, but for its unique take on some dishes, and the massive portions they offer, I highly recommend it.  If you want an awesome breakfast, I do recommend skipping the cheap Vegas cafe and coming here for something quite nice.",

My other friends had a Meatloaf sandwich and a Bacon, Cheese and mashed potato burger and they all were huge and yummy looking... The service was really good.

I really enjoyed this dish on every level.  The maple reduction was nice in that you got some sweetness in the dish but the waffles were still able to stay crispy by not being drenched in it.  In addition, the waffles are stuffed with bacon, how can you go wrong with that?!?!  The sage fried chicken had a crispy crust but was moist and tender inside and had very little fat and the fried leeks rounded out the dish nicely.  My wife had one of the scrambles with egg whites avocado and bacon and it was nice to see that a place that is known for unique dishes can execute something simple just as well.  The avocado was fresh and the bacon seemed to be at that perfect in-between state in that it was crispy yet had some chewy texture; not overly well-done that it looks burnt or under cooked and gummy.  The biscuit had a nice crumbly outer texture and the inside was fluffy and moist.  We'll definitely be coming back upon our next return to Vegas.",

If you like American comfort food you will absolutely adore this place. The decor, ambience and service are great! I had a great time meeting a buddy of my BF here and tried some of his pasta dish. The pasta was very, very good. The fried chicken on top of it I avoided. They like to put branches of rosemary on top of their dishes here. We jokingly referred to them as trees. My BF and I shared some BBQ ribs which had a BBQ sauce that tasted more like teriyaki than anything. It would have been good if the meat was not so fall off the bones tender. Plus the meat didn't have a smoky flavor. They call their food \"Twisted Farm Food\" and indeed it is. There are many things you will notice about your plate that will give you that idea. Their biscuits are not bad. They have a sweet sauce drizzled on them but they are a bit too big for your mouth and a little too hard. I had a mango tea. Be warned - refills are $1. Prices are not bad considering they do give you huge portions.We got seated real quick. Parking is not an issue.",

It was slow cooked real corn beef. Cover in gooey goodness. The potatoes were crisp and yummy. It came with a huge biscuit and eggs. I had the tractor combo which was a huge waffle, sausage and eggs. The portions are huge! The orange juice was fresh squeezed. Service was quick, food was hot and the waiter was hot. It was a good day indeed. Granted this was a Tuesday morning. So we were in and out .",

This I would understand if it was busy, or a weekend, or whatever - not a Wednesday morning when more than half the place is empty. So after waiting for our friends we go BACK up and get seated. I was getting the shakes by then bc I needed food so bad and just ordered and waited. Really couldn't care less about the place until I got my food. Ordered an Apple Juice for my drink and it was really good. It tasted like it was freshly pressed. The order came and yes, it was huge, but stop looking at the size people and realize that they put almost 2in high of mashed potatoes under EVERYTHING. Oh, and one thing I wasn't happy about, they don't list what is actually on/in the dish. They didn't mention that it had a type of salsa on top, or that it was on top of mashed potatoes. What if I had an allergy??? Not good!  So anyway, yes portions were HUGE, but frankly I've had better. Maybe it was just what I ordered, but I won't exactly be rushing to this place anytime soon.",

Nicely seasoned crispy crust on the chicken, and they use the little seen banquet cut called an airline breast. Boneless except for the first joint bone of the wing. And the waffles have a full strip of bacon cooked into them, not just bits sprinkled around. The fried leeks didn't really add much to the dish, and just got in the way. But they, along with the rosemary sprig made for a nice presentation, something you don't usually see with this dish. It's a bit pricy at $16, but the portion is adequate for two meals.

    "text": "Hash House A Go Go!    And no....it's not a strip club with go-go dancers that serve you breakfast! (Even though I know it's Vegas and all).  So I've been to the San Diego location and really enjoyed the place.  When I found out there was one out in Vegas, I figured we must check it out. I was not disappointed!  As usual, the portions were humongo-licious! Pictures just can't describe the astonishment you feel when that plate arrives at your table.  I still feel this place is more about \"quantity\" than \"quality\" though.  But even so, HH is really good and a must place to visit. You do get your money's worth with the amount of food you get!  We had a large party and ordered a number of different dishes. There were lots of food, so we shared to try everything. The Andy's Fried Chicken Benedict was awesome and the blueberry pancake was so big it almost fell off the plate. I had the Andy's Chicken and Waffles which I totally enjoyed but what I really liked (and will probably order next time) is the French Toast.  It was topped with banana cinnamon cream and pecan maple syrup.  Aww man, that was bomb-diggy-diggy.  It's not just the size of the food, but the presentation was great too.  Some of the dishes looked so good, you weren't sure if you should eat it or just admire it for a bit. We ended up taking a few pics with our grub.  Props to our server who was awesome and very attentive. Took care of us well and was quick to refill our drinks.  Only thing I found weird was that there's no hash browns on the menu.  With a name like \"Hash\" House you'd think they'd have it.  My bro ordered the crispy potatoes thinking that was the same, but unfortunately it's not. Just crispified blocks of potatoes, which were still good anyway.  I may have the ask our server about the hash brown thing next time(and there will be a next time!)  Overall, I totally recommend coming here if you are in Vegas.  Prices are affordable and its so much better than many of the breakfast buffets in town.  Prepare to move your belt a few notches over when you're done.",

Our server was most helpful, she described how they did things around there: fresh and quality ingredients, super large portions served on platters, and the trick to avoiding the \"share charge.\" The food is too much for one person, so if you share without the other person ordering at least a side, they charge an extra $2.50. Still worth it despite that stipulation.  The flapjcks can be split between a family of four and cut like a pizza, its ridiculous. The smoked salmon hash is the way to go, its an overwhelming first bite. Their house made strawberry jam is delicious on their biscuits.  Its larger than the San Diego location, so luckily on a Friday morning my party of five did not have to wait at all.  They also serve lunch and dinner, check out the website for the menu.",

OJ: can taste the freshness Mango Iced Tea: Not too sweet, just how i like it Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade: pretty & tasty  FOOD:  * Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs : this this was ridiculously big.  High five to my girls who attempted to conquer this mountain  * House smoked fresh salmon, basil pesto, fresh tomato and melted brie cheese:  a perfect blend.  Can't wait to make it at home ;)  * Corned Beef, red onions and swiss cheese: how the white folks like it!!! you can taste all the spices in every bite!! corned beef done well  * Banana Brown Sugar Pancake: 13 inches of HEAVEN!!!  * Vanilla Waffle:  Not a fan of Belgian style, i like mine thin & crispy ... just like an eggo  SERVICE:  The wait was not as long as i thought it would be, maybe because it was too early to be awake in Vegas? :/   The wait staff was nice, friendly, and very helpful.  When your waiter tells you, YOU GUYS MIGHT WANT TO SHARE, listen to them!!!  I will definitely return next time I'm in Vegas.  There's just so much more my taste buds need to explore :)  Expect an Update Review!!",

After we ordered their popular dishes (chicken and waffles, sage fried chicken), the waitress told us that it'll take another 30-40 mins for our food to arrive, since everything is made from scratch. Not really sure if this applies to all guests or just larger groups. We were getting hungrier by the minute waiting and watching all the dishes pass by.   The service was spot on, our waitress was delightful, and the food we ordered surpassed my taste buds/appetites expectations.   The dishes are big enough to be shared, but they'll charge a small fee for sharing, unless you order a side with that meal. It's been a few months since I ate there, so double check the menu or ask about that. I thought this place was a lot tastier than Bouchon at Palazzo.  Mix up your Vegas plans and eat here the next time you're out there. If it's good enough for Adam from Man v Food, it should be more than enough for you.",

If you want to get a coronary after eating this is the place to go as well.  Don't get me wrong though...The dishes are Damn good... But if you feel like eating what is normally an appetizer as a meal (The Crab Cake made dish)...ugh... I personally got the Sage Chicken Benedict....Now that was good stuff!  I got it with Egg Whites only...like that would really help me remove some fat and calories.  Definitely a place to try but I think a bit expensive...",

I ordered the snickers pancake and the pancake itself was not even that tasty. not a delicious pineapple mimosa either.  all in all I am never going back to hash house on Sahara or ANY of their other locations.  if you guys want a delicious breakfast or lunch with AMAZING customer service go to Black Bear Diner on Trop and jones! even blueberry hill is better than this place....",

    "text": "Are You Obese? Do you want to be obese? Do you like getting monstrous portions of slop to eat while looking at other obese people gorge themselves with giant portions of unhealthy food?  Well then Slop House a GoGo is for you.   I read the reviews.  I got personal recommendations.   I have driven by numerous times and have seen all the cars in the parking lot.   And now, I have experienced it first hand.  This place is not for anyone who cares about their health.  We went there today as I had a hangover and heard this was a place to go to sooth my aching body. Well,we got there and were greeted with LOUD music blaring and some not too friendly barstaff that seemed to behave as thought they were doing me a favor getting me a drink.(to bite the dog that bit me)  We were told the wait would be thirty minutes (which the hostess said was not too bad, often you had to wait for an hour or more for a table), so we sat down after I got my drink. My husband was surfing all of the reviews on Yelp. He asked me two or three times if this is what I wanted because most of the reviews mention the huge portions and the \"Man Vs. Food\" show that this was on. By the way, the wait was not that long.  Well, for those of you who are not acquainted with the show, it is a scourge on America, IMHO. The idea it seems, and I have watched it more than once, is for the host of the show to eat enormous portions of challenging food. I wonder why his liver has not enlarged the way Morgan Spurlock's (of the movie \"SuperSize Me\") did. Probably because he must wait and detoxify between shows. I recommend watching it sometime, it is truly disgusting and an example of Gluttony in the worst way. Well, my husband kept giving me hints that the experience may not be what I wanted, since I am interested in quality not quantity, but I was hungover and needed to eat.  We sat down at a table and noticed that almost every fourth person eating at the tables around us was HUGE. Not just a bit overweight, but hearattack just around the corner fat. I mean people approaching or in fact morbidly obese.  And what were they eating? GIANT PILES of DEEP FRIED saucy slop.  My husband stated once again, that this resturant was on the show \"Man Versus Food\". That is it's claim to fame folks. The show that is suggesting that people should try and eat this HUGE portion of food, when really your stomach is only about the size of your fist. Well, onto the meal.  First, I have to say the waitperson was very nice, and that is about all I liked about this place. The food came. We ordered the fried chicken breast benedict and a spinach salad. The spinach salad must have had a half a pound of well cooked, rather tasty bacon on it, but wow, toooo much bacon. And I LOVE bacon. I must say that the salad was tasty.  The other order was also tasty, but it was ENORMOUS and a giant pile of sadness.  Mashed Potatoes, with bacon on top, covered by three deep fried breaded chicken breasts with scrambled eggs and fried cheese on top covered in what must have been a pint of, once again, tasty sauce. Oh, and there were some biscuits strewn about the plate that were the size of two stacked hockey pucks. They were also good. But what they have done, is taken this to an extreme that is just awful. Tone it down a bit, smaller portions, like maybe 10-20% of the size would be fine. The experience was very disheartening, and pretty disgusting. I will only go there as a goof, if I ever go again. Lose weight America. We have an OBESITY and DIABETES EPIDEMIC.  You want QUANTITY. Eat here with all the other Fatties.  Oh and if you want to just order one thing and share it, they charge you $2.50 for the plate. Sheesh.  Yuck.",

I highly recommend the Chicken and Waffles! The chicken was so moist and infused with rosemary, best fry chicken I've ever had. And the waffles are heavenly with a thick cut of bacon right inside! The waffles were substantial but yet fluffy, perfect texture. Everything comes together with a scallion glaze that's both savory and a little sweet, it goes perfectly with the waffle, bacon and fried chicken. No wonder it's the NYTimes favorite.",

They were all shapes and sizes with ink and piercings. That alone made me happy! The wait was about 20min(If you have a large group be ready to wait a while, or be willing to break up into smaller partys) full bar makes the wait easy. The food is Huge, but tasty as hell. I wished there were more people at my table so there were more things to try. Oh well I'll be going back on a regular basis. I won't even get into the food I would just butcher the menu anyway. These guys have set the bar really high and have no competiton outside the casinos. If you are local try going on weekdays for shorter wait and less crowd. I wish there were more spots like this in Vegas! (!!!Don't be fooled into going to Hash House it is not the one!!!)",

    "text": "Okay, I know that all the other reviewers have mentioned the \"huge\" portions that they serve here. I cannot over-emphasize and re-echo this point enough. They are gigantic. And this is coming from someone who is known to have a notoriously large appetite. You know your friend who finishes his plate instead of taking home leftovers? Or your friend who insists he is full after finishing what he ordered and then proceeds to pick everything off your plate plus eat all the remaining bread on the table? Put those two guys together and you get me. Did I mention the portions are astronomically huge? I ordered the \"appetizer\" beef tenderloin over crispy polenta and explicitly asked the waitress if it was especially large. She replied that it was \"appetizer size.\" Was it an appetizer for a giant?!? This thing was a full-on steak on a hearty slice-of-cake size piece of crispy polenta. And it was covered in cheese! I was so full! But dumbly, I had ordered a sandwich on top of that! The sandwich was a \"griddled\" cheese sandwich which was described as cheddar cheese, avocado, tomato and prosciutto. Each slice of bread was an inch thick! I ate a quarter of it and thought I was going to pass out.  The extreme positive out of all this was that the food was actually good. I marvel at the ability to prepare food that good in such massive quantities. The tenderloin was especially tender and the flavors matched well. I simply could not get past the fact that everything was so big though!",

The problem came when we had to wait for the food. We waited close to an hour and half for the chicken benidict and scamble egg.

I felt as though the staff there believed that it was a privilege for us to be eating there, rather then appreciating the business. I ordered the Sage Chicken and Waffles. I was very disappointed. The food was very bland and the leeks were just completely in the way! My waffles were served in a tower that looks like someon had shoved a bunch of leaves in them to look \"gourmet\". Should have gone to Roscoes! They do not cater to young children. The servings are way to big. My 12 year old daughter had to order a burger from the adult menu. The waiter was very upset that he had to make accomondation and changes to her food. He also was not very friendly-he seemed unhappy having to explain the menu. Being that their menu a bit unique you would think that would not be a problem. And really whats' up with shoving a small palm tree in my daughter burger. Really?? I will not return to this restaurant, but my son loved his food- Eggs Benedict with Chipotle or something.  Not sure why but he definitely wants to return.

The wait for the food was more than 30 minutes and the place was half full, they need more staff or a new system-it is just breakfast after all. Again good food but 90 minutes for breakfast--wait for table then the food and the check on a tues at 10:30am is not really acceptable compared to other places.

    "text": "The food and selection were terrific. The place was packed when my group arrived, but we were not disappointed. For four people, each pair shared a dish, and all four shared the pancake special of the day-a banana pumpkin pancake. There was plenty of food to go around. I had the salmon benedict, which was great. There wasn't a ton of salmon, but the asparagus and sun dried tomatos were great touches for the dish. We also ordered one of the special coffees offered for the day. Honestly, it was bland, missing and the rich coffee taste. The syrup added for flavor didn't help. But that's my only complaint. Everything else was great. Great food, great service, great company, I'd definitely come back.",

    "text": "4 stars for the fried chicken.  Anyway, Fried chicken is awesome. Doesn't matter what you get - sage chicken benedict, chicken and waffles, ...at least one person in your group needs to order a chicken dish to share.  Minus 1 star for the dry (bleh, cough) biscuits and burnt 'crispy potatoes'.  Get the mashed potatoes instead.  The homemade berry jam at the table salvaged the biscuit, but how many people stuck their licked on spoon in there?  Prices are around $15 per plate but there's plenty food to take home.  Creative plates.  Be sure to show up the latest at 9:30am if you want over-easy eggs or poached eggs.  After 11am, they only do eggs scrambled-no exceptions.  Got there around 10:15am. Seated by 10:50am.  Food by 11:45am.  Looooooong wait, but worth trying if you've got time to kill.",

    "text": "Breakfast heaven! The portions are large enough to share or for two meals (at least). I ordered the fried chicken breast with egg, mashed potatoes, bacon and a biscuit. The fried chicken has cereal and rosemary coating making it really flavorful and crispy. The chicken breast is thick and moist. Mashed potato is full of flavor and really good. The menu states that there is a maple reduction but it really was a small decorative thing on the plate. I really wish they had a chicken and waffles dish that wasn't with the leeks. My friend ordered their meatloaf hash. It was pretty normal meatloaf but definitely huge. They have homemade marmalade on every table and is different each time. This is great when you're in vegas, hung over and need to really eat.",

    "text": "ugh. came here for breakfast a few days ago. seriously so overrated and unimpressive. it wasn't busy so we got seated right away. i will say the hostess was friendly though. a lot better than our waitress. after looking over our menu and getting some water we decided on some eggs, biscuits, fruit, and potatoes along with a bacon waffle. our waitress wasn't so helpful and was unsure of what a country scramble was. (how does a place that is suppose to be farmers food not know what a country scramble is?!) she also never came by to check back up on us or refill our waters which we downed pretty fast. about 20-25 minutes pass and we finally get our food complete with no refill on our waters. the food was basic and lacked a lot of flavor. the potatoes did not leave me or my boyfriend wanting more. the eggs had no taste to them. the best part of this plate was the biscuit and fruit, or should i say lack there of fruit. the bacon waffle was not that impressive either. i could have made better. in fact i think i have. i shouldn't complain about it though because it did have more flavor than the eggs and potatoes. yes, the food here may be pretty to look at, but they need to work on flavors and making my taste buds yearn for more. i hardly ate any. our waitress was awful. never checked on us and when i asked for a box she brought me back a wet box and plastic bag along with the wrong check. sorry lady, but you are not getting more than you should. i had such better hopes for hash house after everything i have read on them, but i don't think i can come back to this bland food.",

I prefered the Man vs. Food order vs. the chicken and waffles only because some of the chicken was dry. The Fried Chicken Benedict was so yummy. The chicken soaked up the sauce on the plate. There were biscuits, scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and sauce along with the chicken. Really great service! The staff really seems to love their job. Lots of locals there too. Hoping to go back for lunch and dinner too while here on vacation!",

The food HUGE...as I walked to the restroom I saw folks with places bigger than my head and thought \"my gf and I are going to split this meal\". We did. The breakfast was good. Great portions. Ecletic Menu. With Mimosas. Lounge and Bar area you name it. The ambience is very Nascar, manly, \"lets see how much Diamond Metal plate we can put in this place\"-style.",

    "text": "Ambiance - nice. Service - Good to very good Food - I've had better I had the fried chicken and waffles.  For some reason the food was to greasy.  The chicken was over cooked and dry.  I wonder if the chicken is fried beforehand and then re-fried at order.  I like my waffles crunchy on the outside and tender moist in the middle.  The waffles were soggy and pliable.  My buddy tried the waffle and agreed.  I didn't even finish the dinner, which shocked my friends.    It was not the amount of food that stopped me.  It was the grease.  I have been known to power down 2 entrees at restaurants, including soup/salad.  My buddies had chicken pot pie and the meat loaf pasta.  I got to try both of them which were very good.  I would order either of those next time.  The biscuits are very good  The question is... Would I go back again? No.  If a group a friends went, I would go and not order the fried chicken and waffles.  Would I recommend the restaurant to friends.  No.  But since the Hash House has been on TV, they may want to go no matter what.  Just don't order the fried chicken and waffles.",

We orderd of course the sage fried chicken Benedict..l amazing as expected.. Great chipotle cream gravy and biscuits and juicy chicken. Now I was actually not really happy with what I ordered... Wish I would have ordered something else judging from everyone else's food around me. I got a scramble with smoked salmon and cream cheese and it was just like a mushy blob and actually kinda small portion.... Tasted like something I'd whip up with leftover salmon/lox at home.    We sat at the \"bar\" on high top tables which was fine and way better than waiting.  Can't wait to go back to try a different Benedict Nd have another great breakfast cocktail!",

A group of us came here to try this place cause we heard great things about it. It was pack on Saturday and we waited for about 45 Min's and we were starving so we couldn't wait to eat. The drinks are good My OJ was fresh u can taste that they just made it and my cousin had the watermelon kiwi it was sweet but good.   The food took about 25 Min's but they tell u that on the menu because they cook everything fresh so a Lil wait won't hurt. I got the MVF special which is the Andy sage chicken and omg that bad boy was da bomb. I thought the chipotle sauce may ruined it but no it made it better and the griddle mash on the bottom so freaking delicious they kept picking at it. It is a big portion but if u love to eat then get it. My cousin got the Chicken and waffles and since I live in L.A we have Roscoe's and they known for the waffles and chicken. My cousin said wtf is that bacon inside my waffle F***ing hell ya. The plate looks like a freaking sky scrapper when it comes out he said it was the best chicken and waffles he ever had but I still like Roscoe's but the best fried chicken is at HHGG IMO.   My cousin In law got the tractor farm with the banana Cinnamon french toast and holy cow that toast had to be 3 inches thick it was ridiculously but I had a bite and it sent me to the moon it was that good. Overall we paid 63 bucks for 3 people which is cheaper then the buffet and I was the only one to finish my meal. Place is kool portions are big the staff is friendly but the wait sucks but 5 stars all the way.",

The food on the plates were skillfully made into works of art, but not talking about tiny bits of food here...enormous portions that smelled and looked great as they passed by!  Finally decided on the Chicken and Waffles, and was so glad I did! The Fried chicken was perfectly fried with a nice buttery breading, and the waffles - stack on top of them - were light and fluffy. A perfect match. They also sprinkled some toasted coconut on the top of the waffles that just tied in everything nicely.   Took home a little more then half of it, could have easily have shared this with one or two of my friends!!  Very much recommend checking out if your in Vegas - will be back next time we are!!",

    "text": "One of my favorite places to breakfast on the weekends in my hometown of San Diego is Hash House a Go-Go (or just plain Hash House to locals). Being in Las Vegas and knowing that Sin City has its very own Hash House (three in fact), there was no way I was going to miss a taste of home.  Arriving at a time that would cause a 45 to 90 minute wait at the San Diego location, I was surprised to be told that I would be seated in between 15 and 20 minutes. Happily taking my pager, I shuffled off to wait and in due course was buzzed.  Setting my sights on a \"Campfire s'mores\" mocha ($7) which arrived in an over-sized cup (visibly cracked as seen in the picture) topped with gooey, charred marshmallows, chocolate syrup and Graham crackers.  The first spoonful was thick with marshmallowy goodness and its smokey, crunchy crust brought me immediately back to childhood outings in the woods by the campfire, roasting s'mores with family and friends. If the coffee itself had been better, this mocha would have been perfect but it falls just short of the mark.  Having had many of the offerings on the standard menu over the years, I decided I'd order one of the brunch specials. The Nappanee hash ($14.95) with fresh tomatoes, green beans, marinated steak, smoked mozzarella and crispy potatoes was ordered and anticipated.  Things began going pear shaped when I asked my server If I could add fresh roasted corn (available in the other brunch offering), to my hash and was told \"the Chef can't guarantee the flavor profile if changes are made so we don't allow substitutions or additions.\" FAIL!  In due course my server arrived clutching a medium sized cast iron skillet in a heavy oven mitt. What a great idea, the cast iron would keep my food hot and steamy while I enjoyed it...WRONG! The skillet seems to have been used solely for presentation and not preparation, it was stone cold and after a bite, I realized temperature of my meal was not far off. FAIL!  The \"marinated steak\" was a perfectly cooked medium but lacked flavor. The green beans, which I felt were a strange choice for a breakfast dish, were a bit too al dente and the whole skillet lacked seasoning.   Curiously, the server pointed out the days freshly made strawberry citrus jam and asked if I would like butter to go with it and my buttermilk biscuit to which I replied \"yes,\" but somehow said butter never materialized. FAIL!  In all the meal was mediocre, there were several opportunities to meet or exceed expectations but none were taken advantage of.   The server could have noticed the large, clearly visible crack in my coffee mug,  If cast iron was to be used for presentation only, there's no reason it couldn't have been warmed so as to keep its contents at the desired temperature and  finally, when asked to add roasted corn to the dish, the server could have suggested i have it on the side instead of basically telling me the Chef understands my palate better than I do.  I have a warm place in my heart for Hash House a Go Go and have recommended breakfast/brunch there to many friends and acquaintances alike, I can only hope that this particular meal was an aberration.",

The setting is nice enough, but, that's the best part of the whole visit.  I had the Chicken and waffles. I've been looking forward to trying it as it seems to be the hottest \"new\" thing. The chicken was cooked right, but, the breading was tasteless. The waffles were soft, as they'd been cooked hours ago and sat in a warmer. They also had not taste. My wife and cousin had to send their eggs back to get cooked properly. The potatoes were good and hot.   Overall the service was really slow.....and the experience was less then average...thus the two stars.",

    "text": "I actually love Hash House, believe it or not.  But this last experience was pretty horrible.  I went there with my girlfriend and daughter.  All the entrees had problems but I will only review mine.  It took 10 minutes for a server to stop by the table.  When he finally showed up, I showed him the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurants.com&s=8b83bf0ff8b716aae84527dc95577a310f201b166dcca25c8ca3824b15703869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurants.com</a> certificate I had and he took the orders. I don't know if the certificate had anything to do with it, but we didn't see him again until the food arrived 25 minutes later.  This was slightly alarming since I realized in the interim he never asked me how I wanted the meat in my entree done.    Disinterested service aside, when the food arrived, it looked and smelled delicious.  I had the special, which was a mixed grill with duck breast, lamb chops and a boneless ribeye.  I soon realized however, why he didnt ask how I wanted it done.  The lamb chops were just medium, well prepared and tasted good.  However, the ribeye was only about a centimeter thick, and I'm thinking they could have cooked it for a minute on each side and it still would have turned out how I got it, which was well done, dry and flavorless.  Very disappointing for a cut of meat that is pretty easy to get right in my own experience.    The duck had the skin left on which I was excited to see at first, until I realized they made no effort to crisp it at all.  It was so chewy I had to peel it off just to be able to eat the meat, which was now devoid of seasoning.   The best thing about the entree was the mashed potatoes.  Very very disappointing experience considering what I've come to expect from Hash House, which is big, well prepared portions of delicious food.",

    "text": "Oh my gosh, was this an experience....a great one for dinner! We had a variety...hamburgers, chicken, chops, etc.  Absolute fabulous service and  very creative,gigantic servings.....unbelievable!   After hearing all the great reviews, I was dying to try it on my Las Vegas trip. Definately, the place to go when you are famished.  We were so impressed, that we were taking pictures of the food.   So go try it.   Open 7 days a week, breakfast thru dinner.  And I can't wait until next trip to try breakfast.  They have a Tractor Driver Combo if that tells you anything. I think it's two of everything.  Just so you know, Hash House A Go Go, is casual, loud and super busy, but, a large restaurant.  It was no problem for us and were still seated right away.  Great bar.  I ordered a martini, which I seemed to spill immediately.  One waiter brought another right away, as the poor bus boy cleaned my mess. What a way to start the evening!  Another kudos to the manager.  She didn't like the way my entree looked, so she sent it back to be redone, and brought me a comp salad, big enough for two to share.  They were sure on top of things and I didn't mind the wait.  Try it, you'll be happy you did..........",

    "text": "I concede Hash House ONE star because my husband loves their bloody marias and they do a pretty good lime margarita. That's where the good portion of the evening ended for us.  We have been to three of their LV locations. Each time we've gone to the M location, the service has been spot-on, our food has come out at the same time and of course, the food is ginormous and good.  The Sahara location is the pits. We went on a Saturday night and they seemed to be understaffed so we waited about 30 minutes for a table in spite of the dining room being only about half full.  We waited about 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order. As we were waiting, we glanced around at what some of the other diners were enjoying. When the waitress came back with our drinks, I asked her a couple of (I thought) fairly simple questions about the menu. My husband also wanted to know what the people next to us ordered because it looked and smelled delicious.  The waitress walked over to the other table and asked them what it was. We were slightly more than a little embarrassed. The waitress didn't know the answers to the questions I asked, either.  Negative five points for menu knowledge.  Then, when our meals came out, my husband got his first. Being the gentleman he is, he waited for our son and me to get ours. And we waited. And we waited. After about 10 minutes, mine came out. We asked the server, very politely, if the kitchen knew anything about the proper firing of meals because we had never experienced this at another location. The server, while holding my plate in his hand the whole time, proceeds to argue with my husband and tell us that since the kitchen doesn't use any heat lamps, they brought out food whenever it was ready.   Which is all fine except that just the week prior at the M location, I went to lunch with a group of 15 people and our meals all came out within a couple of minutes of each other.  But back to the Sahara location. The server continues to argue with us and finally just stops talking. Standing there. Glaring at us. After a few seconds of this I looked at him and asked, \"May I please have my dinner plate or are you going to continue to hold it hostage?\" At which point, he thumped it down on the table in front of me.  Did I mention that the restaurant manager walked by at least twice during this and didn't say a word? Did I also mention that our son STILL did not have his dinner?  And at this point, both my husband's food and my food are cold. Then comes my son's hamburger.   All told, three meals over the course of about 20 minutes. Without a word from our waitress, drink refills or the manager stopping by.  I will concede that my husband's bloody marys are always good. My grilled cheese sandwich, though cold, was still tasty. And my son said his hamburger was okay but nothing special.  We would much rather take the extra 30-40 minutes out of our lives and go to the one inside M, where they actually appreciate their customers and have common sense when it comes to firing food in the kitchen.",

That's right, the Chicken and Waffles is so hearty that you alone won't finish it.    Hash House is located about 20-30mins away from the strip.  You have ample parking.  I recommend going early because it gets busy but do not fear cause the lines go down pretty fast.  The ambience of the restaurant is very breathtaking.  Once you head inside the atmosphere changes to a farm like feel.  Many famous people walked through those doors as pictures of them bombard you at the front of the door.  I recommend getting anything on the menu.  Don't hesitate to choose because everything of the menu is to die for.  Eat Up!!!",

    "text": "First off--yes, I went because I saw it on Man vs Food.   Now that is out of the way...   There were three of us. I ordered what I saw on TV, the fried chicken benedict. Friend #1 had the french toast. Friend #2 had the chicken salad sandwich.   Fried Chicken Benedict: It was big as my head, without exaggeration. This will server 3 people. I barely ate 1/3rd.. but I am not a huge portion eater anyways. I saw a biker kind of guy next to us eat 3/4 of it, which I though was super impressive. Flavours? A little too much on the plate. You get a mixture of spicy, creamy, zesty, etc.. it's really hard to describe. If you don't know it by now, I'll call it out from bottom up; mashed potatoes, biscuit, tomato slice, spinach, bacon, griddled cheese, fried chicken breast.. and all drizzled with chipole cream sauce. It is definitely a brunch item, not breakfast. I have to say, I saw a someone else order it, but with the sauce on the side. Smart!   French Toast: More like, french loaf. Again, massive insane portions. Only half was eaten. But I sampled this, and it was quite delicious. Probably one of the best french toast that I had.   Chicken Salad Sandwich: By far the best chicken salad sandwich I have ever tried. Nice dill flavour, and moist chicken meat. The multigrain bread was excellent too. Fries were super hot and fresh. They had a bit of coating on them (very very lightly), and helped stay crispy until the end.   You must try the waltermelon-kiwi lemonade. Very delicious, and thirst quenching.   Price-wise, it can be considered as a good value, just because of the portions. I would say, SHARE dish. Do not attempt at it alone.   Service was prompt and friendly, despite the hectic atmosphere.",

    "text": "SCHNIKEYS!! This Hash House A Go Go is not what I was expecting! I've been hearing about a blue collar breakfast greasy spoon country trash diner that serves Budweiser in a paper bag along with a deliciously greasy bacon and omelet hangover cure.  This is the Hash House A Go Go, and yet it isn't.  The modern decor, ultra clean lines, and stainless steel lend a silence and swankiness to a place that should have plastic red and white checkered tableclothes and lots of decorative pigs.   I had the Man vs. Food favorite, the fried chicken benedict with eggs and biscuits and three chicken breasts, some bacon, layers of fried cheese, little baby rosemary trees, 2 inches of mashed potatoes, a lake of delicious sauce, and a watermelon wedge. Really.   All the jazzy stuff stuff was great, but the chicken itself was dryer than Stephen Wright's comedy. And the portions? Yeah, they're huge, but this is America, and it fits right in with our SUV, megashopping, megaconsuming culture.   So twisted farm food that costs 25$ an entree? Meh, take me to a diner, where I can wear my Daisy Dukes and sing along to Hee Haw. Burnt hash browns and a half-gallon of ketchup fit my idea of tasty farm food even better than pate de foie gras (seriously). And if you want it twisted? Well, bring yer sister and make out with her in the parking lot, you sicko.",

    "text": "Call me a food-snob if you must, but when I dine at a 'family-style' restaurant like Hash House A Go-Go, I generally do so with an open mind and without much expectation.  Having dined their before without incident, I would describe my previous experiences as 'benign', and would have gone back without a thought.  However, after my most recent 'late' breakfast there, I will never be back.  A guest's food allergy or dietary restriction should not be considered 'an inconvenience' to any restaurant, especially a family-oriented chain-style restaurant. (I just learned from a friend that HHAGG is NOT a chain.)  My friend and I planned to order 'The Original' Benedict, which features a biscuit, spinach, mashed potatoes, scrambled egg (which is the only kind of egg they offer for 'late' breakfast, which makes me wonder if the eggs are already pre-cooked), bacon, and a red pepper cream sauce. We asked for a simple substitution, and were met with a perplexed look on the face of our server  - we asked to have the bacon on the side (my friend cannot eat pork), and a substitution of the red pepper cream (I am allergic to red peppers) with the chile cream offered on another Benedict dish.  The waitress stopped writing the order down at one point and said she didn't think the 'chef' would accommodate our request, because it was \"changing the integrity of the dish!\"    Ok, granted, every restaurant should have a signature dish, but for goodness' sake - the service staff is using verbiage like 'chef' and 'integrity of a dish' in a scrambled-egg only, dry biscuit, ridiculously-gargantuan portioned,  family joint?  I politely asked the server to go ask the chef what he recommended for two guests with our dietary restrictions.  All said and done, they ended up 'allowing' our request of bacon on the side and a different sauce, only after we agreed to pay an additional fee for the substituted sauce.  Made me wonder if I would have ordered the dish which contained the sauce I had wanted, and substituted with the red pepper cream, would they have given me a discount?  Our bill for 2 coffees, 1 Original Benedict, 'a side of chile cream sauce', and a side of smoked salmon was $29.00 - oh, I almost forgot the 'token rosemary spring' stuck smack-dab in the middle of the food (I have been pondering how a rosemary sprig helps the 'integrity' of the dish)!   Considering I had to wash the dry, brittle biscuit down with two glasses of water, the scrambled eggs were cold and brown, and even the rosemary sprig was wilting (what is the purpose of an inedible garnish anyway - have you ever eaten the raw sprig of parsley or kale obtrusively arranged on the side of your plate?), I would have to say that value was non-existent in this restaurant.  It has always been my belief that even the most rudimentary of restaurants understand that accommodating reasonable guest requests is a basic tenet of 'hospitality', especially in a troubled economic climate.",

The casino looks like Circus Circus's Casino.  I heard they'll be doing renovations, but we'll see.  Anyways, onto the restaurant.  They don't serve your traditional comfort meals, it's more like comfort meals with a sprinkle of swank and steroids!  The meals are HUGE!  They even have a sharing fee of $2.50 if you don't get your own plate, who does that?! lol  I've only came here for brunch and it is good hangover food, but the service can get slow when too many people show up.  I like the food.  The place is just too hyped up because it's a good place to people watch and the portions of their food.  I've had the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken, the Bacon Waffles ( I would never get again because the bacon was soggy in the waffles!) Most of their entrees are DOUSED in a heavy sauce!  Music in the place can get too loud.  I don't like to come here, but majority rules when you're in LV with friends and they seem to like the place, QUE SERA SERA to me.",

To make this more extra cool it was her first time visiting Vegas, so she wanted to hit up some of the man vs. food places... and this was one of them.  So they both shared the huge plate - Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit - of course between the both of them, they finished it.  They said it was good. I had a HUGE banana pancake that I could not finish.    I came on another visit and ordered this for myself (yeah, how is this 100lb girl supposed to finish this?!).  I could only finish half of it - I did starve the whole day.. making this sage chicken dish all my meals in one.  Just everything piled on, ranging from sweet to salty, good chicken and mashed potatoes, was a really good combination to please my tastebuds.  I finished off with the s'mores mocha - a little bit on the bitter side, but it was alright. i just wanted the marshmallow and grahm cracker.    FYI: long wait 1 hour, and depending on the time of day you go. unless you go to the bar...",

The breakfast I had here I remember less (seeing as it was 6am and I was very drunk). It was good though. Everything was fresh and it was made to perfection- not greasy, not thrown together. The bloody mary had to be the greatest though. I might stop here again next time just to get one of those!",

Let's just say that you'll definitely be getting delicious leftovers!  The bf and I needed to fuel up before we headed home from Vegas. We wanted to get away from the craziness of the Strip (they do have another location at the Venetian and etc) so we stopped by this location. The wait wasn't too bad but just make sure you go slightly before busy hours though!  We ordered:  1) Fried Chicken Benedict: Imagine a yummy biscuit drizzled with chipotle cream, eggs, mashed potatoes, smoked bacon, tomatoes and that yummy fried chicken! It's literally a savory mountain that you and your stomach need to climb over to reach that euphoria (aka food coma). I highly recommend this one. It's definitely fit for 2-3 people (5/5)  2) Smoked Salmon Scramble: If you're looking for a slightly healthier option, the smoked salmon is delicious with the basil pesto, tomato, and melted brie cheese that is served with crispy potatoes. But honestly, I preferred the Fried Chicken Benedict (4/5)  3) Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade: Definitely get this drink! It's not only perfect for Instagram but the drink is really yummy! If you don't finish it, you can ask for a plastic cup to go and take it on the ride home! (5/5)  Overall, the food here is really yummy and I am not joking about the gigantic portions. The servers here are friendly and the atmosphere is pretty chill as well. Prices are decent, but hey the food is good!",

They only had one server so they didn't expect more than they had either.   The food: First of all I was very happy to see we were given a full menu. We could order anything even breakfast. The biscuits with honey butter (free appetizer) shouldn't even be served. They were hard and crumbled hardly warm and definitely not worth eating. Just really pretty to look at. My crab cake sandwich was delicious! His stuffed burger want really what we expected. It's not really a stuffed patty as we were thinking it just a burger with a lot of add-ons. He wasn't that impressed with it. My plate had a small amount of fries where his plate had a good amount. The prices are very reasonable! Definitely a plus.  The service: we were seated right away. Then giving this while run down on filling out a card and getting a free meal and a free meal for birthdays. The server was nice but either had too much going on or just not very good at multi tasking. He told us he was bringing out biscuits for an appetizer. We got kinda upset waiting for that. Finally he walks by and says the biscuits are coming out soon they are being made hot and fresh. They ended up bringing out the biscuits with the meal. So a fail there. Then it turned out to be a lie. They were far from fresh. When we finished our meal we waited quite a while before seeing our server again and when we did he just brought us our check. We were going to order dessert to go but got over it as soon as he did that.   So all in all the prices are great three food is good just don't expect too much from the service or expect the meals to be as they were a few years back.",

It is a \"comfort food\" restaurant, which means lots of food, big ass burgers, fried this and that. I'm not being critical, but it is what is and it was pretty darn good. It's good for families, kids and there were plenty of them, surprisingly all were behaved. We ordered polenta sticks, sounded interesting, fried green tomatoes and their world famous Andy's sage fried chicken. Needless to say we didn't finish it all and looked at each other and said next. The service was great, prompt and by a helpful young man named Oscar. I would say for us, we aren't this kind of comfort food folk, but for those who are....have at it!",

    "text": "More than just huge portions: Creative. Delicious. Memorable.  Just take, for example, what I ordered from their selection of benedicts: \"Andy's Sage Fried Chicken\" ($16.99 a bit pricey, but it's pretty much two meals). I ordered it not knowing what would arrive in front of me would be a well-thought out mound of food shaped in the form of an artful sculpture - I must've sat there for a good minute taking pictures as I attempted to figure out where to start chowing down.  It did not disappoint, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had a nice kick with that chipotle cream. YUM.  An extra bonus point for it coming out of the kitchen in rather quick timing (especially considering the busyness of Christmas Day that it was).  The environment is better than expected. I've been in Vegas for more than a few years and noticed every damn weekend driving by this place, HH has a crowd of people out in front.  This always discouraged me from trying, but crowds/waiting can be avoided if you travel alone or up to four by just heading to the bar area; they have the counter as well as bar tables.  If waiting can't be avoided, kill some time by checking out the celebrities that've stopped in - there are headshots all over the entrance.  If I come back for a huge party, it's gotta be pre-planned, reserved, or whatever because waiting for a table when you're hungry sucks.  But more likely is that I'll come back for the bar or happy hour (everyday, 3p-6p).",

OMG 1/2 a chicken with cooked carrots corn on the cob which was roasted & yummy mashed potatoes with a side of some delicious sauce. Not sure where it was supposed to go but I put it everywhere it was that good. Took most of my dinner home because I was very full. The special was $10.00 and the drink was $11.99. Our Server was ok. They have great food. Luckily when we went at 5:00 it was empty but it was packed a few hours ago. I'll be back for sure.",

Its my favorite go to place when im in vegas i perfer this location as its away from the busy LV strip traffic like the one inside Imperial palace.  2. Seating is always pretty fast  3. Food always taste great my fav is the chicken and waffles 4. My fav drink is always a hit and now it comes spiked if you like it. Watermelon,  Kiwi, lemonade (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>) 5. The food is normally brought out pretty fast as well 6. Large portions to where 2 can share a plate (maybe 3 ppl) 7. Our waiter for the day was nice and serviced us as well as he could as he had 7 tables himself to wait on. Here's why i gave it a 4 star.   Now this situation nevered happened to me before as this was my 2nd time at this location in the past few years, but it was strange how the hostess sat all the black families/couples toward the back of the restaurant near the restroom. At 1st i was like why is she taking us all the way to the back when it was plenty of open tables right behind where she was standing when we arrived so when another couple came in after we were seating they said the same thing out loud which confirmed what i was thinking. As we sat there with eatung our meal more guest arrived a couple a blk male and white woman was sat near the back but since he was a larger guy a booth was not going to work so they were seating in the table area near the back. There was an older white couple with there grandkids who were mixed raced (blk and white) and they were placed at the table in the middle section not all the way to the back but close.. then the few white or non black customers who walked in was near the bar or the front of the resturant we noticed as we were leaving mind you there was plenty of seats in the area where the tables. It could have read the restaurant setup that day but then again i dont think i was wrong on this situation. Management needs to review this process as to how they seat guest as it could make an situation go bad for this location. This occurred on Friday the 15th around 4-5p.. check your video for that day..",

    "text": "This is the place for the volume feed. As others have said, the portions are large if not downright scary. Moving beyond portion size, however, HH is not as big on flavor.   I ordered the chicken and waffles-- the chicken (with the requisite sprig of rosemary) was crisp and moist, but rather bland. The belgian waffles had large pieces of bacon mixed into the batter and thus cooked into the waffle. Sadly, all I could taste was bacon. The 'maple reduction' drizzled around the waffle reminded me of a balsamic reduction and didn't really help. A side of syrup perked it up, but overall, hard to say it is worth ~$14.   My cousin had the corned beef hash- big pieces of corned beef but otherwise just as bland as my food. He say the (pizza-sized) flapjacks are better, so I may give it a try.    Overall, I think HH would be great if they can improve upon their flavors. Once over the novelty of big food, they need flavors to back them up.",

I asked the hostess if we could sit at an open booth, she said it was closed in a flat tone.  Then I asked the waitress also, never being one to take no for an answer.  She looked at me as if I had asked to suck on her toes, and said \"NO, that section is CLOSED.\"   Otherwise she was very cheery.  Other than that bit of amusing oddity, the food and the service was great.  We had bloody marys and a big ass plate of eggs benedict.  My friend said I'd have leftovers, but I managed to wolf most of it down.  The bloody mary could've been stronger, but was still quite good, what with the veritable salad of fresh veggies hanging out of the big glass.    I also stopped by there my last weekend in Vegas when a friend came to visit.  We sat outside on the patio and had just the breakfast we needed to decide to stay another day in Vegas -- see my Red Rocks Casino review  ;^)",

    "text": "Come really, really hungry.  That's the best advice I can give to anyone that wants to visit Hash House a Go Go.  You will have more food on your plate than you can comprehend in a glance.  Galaxies have been known to be smaller.  The gravitational pull of the chicken and waffles may trap you in its orbit, forcing you to consume the chicken just to have a chance to escape intact... not that you'll mind doing so.  We've been to HHaGG multiple times for both breakfast, brunch, and lunch, and have never run into a meal we didn't like.  Their reliance on potatoes as a filler sometimes borders on the crazy however.  I'm tempted to ask for my next meal without any potatoes, if it's listed as an ingredient.  The meals we've experienced are the stuffed burgers, fried green tomatoes, chicken and waffles (with strips of bacon through the waffles), the chicken pot pie, the home-made corn beef hash, and some of the specials.  The chicken soup was also very flavorful.  I can't think of anything I'd improve on when it comes to the food.  Just remember that your eyes are larger than your stomach.  No one's going to think less of you if you suggest splitting an entree here!",

I've really liked everything I've ever ordered here. It's reasonably priced for the massive portions. The best part is watching first timers react to the plate size.   The hashes and benedicts are quite good. I'd stick to something a little more interesting on the menu... A friend ordered the vanilla waffle and as expected it was rather large but there wasn't enough butter or syrup in the world to make that thing not come off as super dry due to it's rather large size. So get waffle or pancakes that comes with something on it to break up the massive breadiness.",

    "text": "The  food at Hash House A Go Go is delicious! The dishes my friend and I ordered were prepared imaginatively as well as flavourful. We enjoyed their adaption of chicken and waffles. We felt the chicken coating can benefit by adding a little more spice for heat, but thrilled with the crisp chunks of apple smoked bacon blended into the perfectly plump crispy waffles. We also ordered an egg scramble made with house made dried tomatoes and fresh Feta cheese. Accompanying the eggs are potatoes that are crispy and perfectly seasoned. The portions are large for me, however it makes sharing with your chums just the right size. Or, you can take it home and warm it up later for a snack. Plates are garnished appropriately with fresh herbs. I recommend Hash House A Go Go, however I have only eaten at the W. Sahara location and cannot comment if all of them are consistent, but I sure hope they are.",

Most of the time I order the Belgian waffles and fried chicken.  You get 4 very large waffles stuffed with bacon and two pieces of fried chicken.  I only ate one waffle and one piece of chicken.  I will have the other waffles, one each day for breakfast and have the chicken for dinner with other left-overs. The waffles were very good but the chicken breasts were very small and mainly crust with little meat.  Our cousin from Maryland was with us and she could not believe the size of the portions.  Like most restaurants it was very cold and they did not raise the temperature when we asked them to.  We will come back next time we get a visitor to share in the experience of eating here and seeing all the different very large dishes other people were getting.",

I am disappointed to say im not one of them.  I ordered the meatloaf hash because a lot of reviews said it was really good and I like meatloaf, I also figured all of the hash varieties offered would be good considering this place is a HASH HOUSE. The meatloaf hash was just and i think that is being kind.   My dad ordered the sausage gravy pot pie and it was not a pot pie at all it was more like a plate of country gravy it was very odd. My husband ordered the sage fried chicken eggs benedict and he said it was good but not great.  There is always a long wait to get in to this restaurant and it is really not worth it and I am a little sad because I really wanted to like the Hash House A Go Go",

Anything on the menu could be the Wikipedia picture for comfort food.  In fact, if you have a moment can you please update the Wiki, the pictures there are boring and this menu is truly exciting and imaginative.   The biscuits and gravy are a must. Wow I loved these. I'd come back just for this plate alone but if I'm going why not get more than just a side.  We had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and the Biscuits and Gravy. This was our breakfast and lunch.  Amazing food, great prices and a very nice restaurant. Just short of five stars but a must try. They will never get a Michelin Star and that's good. This isn't pertinacious French food, this is American!    I love this place. I truly hope the owners have seriously considered opening a second location in San Francisco, we really need it. There is a huge niche that needs to be filled in the foggy city. I know what your thinking, \"You've already got 4,000+ restaurants and don't need another.\" We have nothing like this. Please come.

I got the chicken and waffle breakfast and my husband got the man vs. food house special.   I was surprised by the portion because their hella huge. Its like a meal for two. I am a big fan of chicken and waffle breakfast but I was not impressed with theirs. First the waffle was soggy so I asked for the waffle to be crispy. When it came back to me, it still wasn't crispy but the server said that's their crispy. I asked for it to be almost burned. I waited patience and started eating my chicken. It was actually good. But reminded me of southern style chicken. I don't care much for it. When the waffle came back, it still was not crispy. So I just gave up on it.   I think my husband had the andy's sage fried chicken. It a bunch of stuff on a place. I don't even know where to explain. For me it was ALRIGHT. I would eat it but it was just too much to finish. On the other hand, my husband (who is a chef) did not care for it at all. So that was a total fail.   Would I do back again? Probably not. We love good food and appreciate where what we spend our money on. This was just not one of them.",

When we asked to be moved because we were right next to the kitchen the manager accommodated us right away. They weren't very busy but the place was not a ghost town. Prompt service and friendly attentive waitress. We were very happily surprised with this place. I had never heard of it before. The most amazing thing in the menu in my opinion was the biscuits.

I would only come back here if I was being dragged to it by tourists who use the moniker \"foodie\" too freely.

If I'm going to eat unhealthy, I'd rather go to Raising Canes BJs, Cheesecake Factory... anywhere else really.",

Came on Monday for breakfast and it wasn't crowded at all. We were seated right away and gave us water within seconds. We ordered the basic, the fried chicken and waffle and I was going for the chicken pot pie dish (because I saw it on yelp) and the lady said they don't have it for breakfast.. ok fine. I scanned the menu quick and realize I can't decide quick enough and it'd be better if she came back so I told her kindly to just come back and we'll order when I make my mind and she wasn't so happy about that.   We let her know I was ready and waited for her to come back to take our order which took about 10-15 minutes. I get it, you got tables to wait I respect that but she was not doing her job. By the time she put the order in for the chicken benedict our friend's food was out already.   The water tasted very funky for a highly raved restaurant so we asked for lemon slices and the lemon slices they gave us had oil all over them...? (at this point I'm thinking this lady hates us)  In short: Proportions are huge, as said in other reviews. - I would share dishes if you really want to come here. Food is interesting & different take on breakfast - order the fried chicken benedict, it's a different take on a benedict with good mashed potatoes on the bottom and it has a spicy creamy chipotle sauce - order the chicken pot pie... and let me know how it tastes! but come after 1pm",

We've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a table.  I'm guessing that they are busiest  during breakfast time.  While waiting, there are many photos of celebrities to view on the restaurant's walls.  There were pictures of actors, actresses, sports stars, politicians, and other tv personalities.  Pretty impressive.  As I said earlier, they serve gigantic portions here.  Almost every dish that comes to the tables is just heaping with loads of food!!  They look like a very messy, yet beautiful culinary creations!!  Messy & Beautiful.  Comfort food at it's finest.  My favorite dish is Andy's Sage Fried chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower!  Just like about everything else on their menu, this dish is humongous!!  Each bite was simply delicious goodness.   I had leftovers that lasted me two more meals!  A nice drink to wash everything down with is their kiwi watermelon lemonade.  For dessert, I like the bread pudding.  Yeah, 99% of the time when I dine out, I save room for dessert!  One of these days, I'll have to come here for breakfast to try their pancakes and lunch time for burgers.  Terrific food, but not quite 5 stars worthy!  So very close though!",

Surprisingly the star of the plate is the fluffy WAFFLES (5 of them to be exact) each of which has a few strips of bacon BAKED IN! Whoever thought of that is a culinary genius.   The chicken itself is good but the batter could actually use more seasoning or some form of Louisiana/Crystal hot sauce to complement it. The crispy leeks are amazing though and I would definitely ask for extra because they are so flavorful.   Portions are ridiculous, in a good way. Could easily share a plate of chicken and waffles with someone else. Though I did see a guy down the entire plate like a champ one table over. I however had extra bacon waffles for the next two days.. no complaints there :)",

    "text": "Yes, yes, the portions sizes are outrageous (the chicken salad sandwich was pushing 12 inches high) and the food excessive (a bacon bloody mary aka the BLT Mary), both of which are fine. But let's be honest here - the real highlight of going to Hash House A Go Go is the utterly amazing buttermilk biscuits and fresh fruit preserves!   The service here is really good too - super friendly and attentive. But back to the biscuits. They were massive in size, like everything else here, but baked perfectly that they had a crust to support the weight of the peach and pear preserves when spooned on yet still soft and chewy in the middle. Delicious. Shame on all of you other diners in the restaurant who didn't touch their biscuits. Don't you know there are starving people in the corner booth (aka me) who would love to have it for their own? No, really, you don't know what you missed out on.  As for the rest of the food, it's decent. Other than the massive portions garnished with a twig of rosemary, I don't know that the dishes are exceptionally unique. And the drinks, it's kind of the like the food. Everything done in excess and for show. Granted, the Bud in a Bag is funny enough that you should get it just for the photo op. And the BLT Mary, well why not?, you're already taking a year off your life with the plate of food you're consuming in front of you. But honestly, come here for the biscuits and preserves. It's worth the hour plus wait you're guaranteed to experience when you come here for breakfast/brunch/lunch.",

Fortunately for us, the wait was only 10min was seated at the \"reserved\" tables in the bar.  Sweet.  Hash House - Fresh Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach (check out the picture)  The eggs were perfectly fluffy and moist, just like the potatoes with a crispy skin.  Make sure to try the seasonal jam, right now it's peach season so unequivocally, home made peach jam!    Call me ghetto, but I think KFC has the best biscuit.  Growing up in socal, my soul food experience is limited, but hash house's biscuit was just as good, especially with the home made jam.",

The food always tastes great, but someone in our group has gotten sick every year from eating here. The wait times are horrible, and our waiter was kind of meh. After we placed our order it took about 30+ min to get the food. The food doesn't taste good enough to justify the risk of food poisoning and the long waits.

They make their own jam, sort of.  It was a gelled mess of a real strawberry.  I saw other people get waffles or pancakes that are huge but you only get one as a serving.  They get two stars instead of one because service was fairly good.  However, I would not return.  Too much money for nothing special.",

(Well, I suppose in a nation where we set aside a Thursday each November to promote gluttony, that is what we want.)  My advice: If you go, begin a regimen of low dose aspirin a few days in advance to thin the blood and prepare your body for what it is about to ingest. Even better advice: Share. Best advice: Eat here after a long night at a club, doing the walk of shame, squinting into the sun which peaked above the horizon while you were busy...well, busy, and let the food absorb the liquid refreshment you enjoyed the past seven hours.",

Today, Hash House a Go Go is nothing more than a bad joke, where the punch line is actual line you have to stand to wait for a seat.  The first and most glaring problem is the staff - both front of the house and back.  The wait staff is clearly more interested in their tips than anything else. This happens quite a lot when a restaurant gets popular - it tends to draw the kind of servers who know that your crappy little tip will have no effect on their daily take, so they focus on turnover instead of quality. They don't care if you are unhappy with anything, just eat and get out so they can get someone else at your table. Management loves these kinds of servers, because they increase the bottom line.   The kitchen staff is even worse. My HH Original Benedict was drowning in red pepper sauce - I mean DROWNING. Just touching it with a fork caused a tsunami that almost crashed over the edge of the plate. I liked the sauce, but it became the only thing you could taste. The biscuit was just terrible, it was so heavy it was indistinguishable from the potatoes it rested on and together they tasted like paste. Now if this is on purpose (some sort of take on their 'going to extremes' theme) then the chef who created this monstrosity is an idiot. If it was an accident and they let it leave the kitchen looking like this, then it's obvious that no one cares about quality anymore.  The second problem has to be management - it's apparent that profit is the only thing that matters.  Congratulations on your short-lived success Hash House - it's a shame you let it go to your head. It won't be long before your greed will eat you alive.",

    "text": "Another awesome brunch today with \"Twisted Farm Food.\"  I love many things about this place. The decor, the huge menu, the portions. Yes, the portions are big enough for you to share, take home, and have for maybe another meal. Or two. But it's good yumy food.  I've had many items off their menu. French Toast, waffles, corned beef, their amazing variety of flapjacks, scrambles... Today's choice was Andy's Sage Fried Chicken with Bacon Waffles. Fried Chicken isn't traditional, but still good. Belgian-style waffles with slices of bacon in-between. I don't really need to say much about that. Isn't everything better with bacon?? Just kidding...  The other highlight was the Blueberry Pecan flapjacks. Nutty and fruity fluffy soft pancakes drizzled with warm maple syrup. Nom nom nom... My son even gobbled it up.  Their service is great, the only thing that takes awhile is your food to arrive. It wasn't unreasonable, and you kind of forget about it once your ginormous plate of food arrives. The manager always comes around when plates are cleared to inquire how our meal were.  The prices are pretty hefty for breakfast, but you do get a lot for what you paid. I have two take-out boxes in my fridge right now...  Till next time! :)",

Some drinks came while another one needed a third reminder. Food came out pretty quick though.  Got corned beef hash. The corned beef was alright, the potatoes were pretty bland. I ordered my eggs over medium and one of them was runnier than all hell.   Overall, it's a bit overrated. The portion sizes are huge and if you stick with the few classics (pork tenderloin eggs benedict, chicken and waffles etc), you'll have a good time. Other than that, the food will most likely disappoint. The service wasn't that great. The place was busy but I did see a lot of workers standing around. Just didn't seem like they had a good system in place.    It's an okay place, just stick to the favorites.",

Someone w/ a hangout or smoked a to of weed may enjoy it but someone looking for a great flavorful breakfast would be disappointed.   I thought I would give them a 2nd chance I tried something a little simpler. I mean who could screw up breakfast (Eggs w/ cheese scrambled easy, chicken sausage, potatoes, fruit, & their signature drink w/ a shot of vodka). OMG was I wrooooooong!!! My eggs were fried too hard and cold, my sausage taste like it was cooked in the microwave, potatoes hand no seasoning & I didn't get my fruit. What was really gross I saw one of the staff picking food of a customers plate in the window.  What really made me decide to never return was the disgusting black crap in my shot of vodka! Not once but 3 times they brought me a dirty glass. I was so sick to my stomach b/c I poured the shot in my drink & was sipping on it till my friend noticed the black filth along the bottom of the shot glass. After the 2nd dirty shot glass I asked to speak to the manager Ryan he acted like he didn't see it. Dumb $$$ saw exactly what was in the glass he's a horrible actor. Finally he admitted to seeing the black crap. When he came back with the 3rd shot glass he said 3rd time is a charm & giggled. WTF!!! There was black crap along the rim of the glass again. No apology just some dumb ass remark. To add insult to injury this douche bag charges me for 3 shots I didn't even drink!! When the waitress brought the bill I asked to speak to him again. I told him I thought his comment was very inappropriate & why the f$&k am I being charged for sh*t I didn't drink due to their filthy establishment. I asked him did he even tell his staff to check the glasses. Did he see what was in the glasses what if I get sick. He said no he didn't check to see what it was but the douche bag had nerve to say uhhhh ohhh I'm pretty sure you won't get sick. How the heck do you know you jack @$$!! You don't even know what was in the glass. I called the health dept & will never return the 2 hour wait is defiantly not worth getting sick over nor is the food & service! I wish I could give this place no stars def doesn't deserve it. Don't believe the hype the food is gross.",

I visited Hash House on a Sunday at about 10 am and we waited 45 minutes to be seated then were informed by our server that we should order quickly because the ticket times were running about 40 minutes. This wasn't a huge issue for us as we were visiting with friends and had some time on our hands, but it is definitely something to keep in mind.  I do have one issue with drink prices. We were told we could purchase drinks at a discounted price at the bar in the waiting area, which we did, but discounted they were not.  Two very small mimosas cost $22 dollars! This was especially upsetting when after being seated we realized the menu price for a mimosa was only $8.   Overall, a great place to go every once in a while, but I wouldn't make it your go to breakfast joing",

I also ordered the Kiwi watermelon lemonade, it tasted very out of season.  The kiwi was sour the watermelon wasn't sweet at all, I guess it was refreshing in the way of lemon in water but I don't think it was worth the price.

The owner/designer/chef were geniuses at creating an experience for the senses.  There is a Mid-West/Italian fusion thing going on in the menu which works on different levels. A rosemary springs impales a stack of potatoes and egg gallettes, chicken in olive oil is incorporated into a hash...well you get the idea.    Another interesting element is that each dish is conceived architecturally, a feature that would normally be reserved for  a top Michelin-rated Parisian restaurant.  Food items such as toasted raw pasta straws, herbs in their natural states, etc., give delight to the eye, if not to the palate.    Form then moves on to function as the familiar flavors are juxtaposed in unusual combinations which subvert our expectations in a way that would make Andrew Zimmer wax all the more eloquently about the dish being\"over the top\"!  Lest you think you will push yourself from the table still unsatisfied, let me assure you that each dish would easily feed two or three light eaters. The wait staff were equally well trained and friendly (a Midwest trait to be sure!) which only added to this delightful experience.",

I don't understand why people go to work when they don't even do their job!!!  She basically said how many and walked towards a table. The experience with our waitress was horrible. She came up to the table and didn't even introduce herself and briefly asked what we want for drinks.  After waiting 15 min she finally came with our drinks and asked if we were ready to order.  Yes we are!! We finally ordered and she finally gave me some suggestion on how big of a portion I would get which was nice. When we got our food it was very plain it didn't have any flavor I order the number 5 burger the guacamole was old and black. The waitress never came back to check on us. I had to Hunt her down. I finally got the bill and she charged me for an extra meal.  It took her another 15 min to adjust it. I would have to say the portions are huge but I'd rather get best tasting food for what I paid. I will not return because the service was bad and the food. I hate writing bad reviews but this one was by far the worst experience.",

    "text": "With all of their hype from their appearance on \"Man vs. Food\", Hash House A Go Go is always busy during peak dining hours, especially breakfast. Because of that I've always tried to avoid eating there. I finally gave in the other day and stopped by for dinner, even though they're not know for their post-breakfast foods.  We got there early and were seated right away, unfortunately at the crappiest table they had -- the table closest to the entrance and in a high-traffic area. We even asked the hostess if we could have a booth but she said she had to seat us at a table. Continuing with the bad service, our waiter decided not to show up at our table for a good ten minutes. Another fifteen minutes later we finally got some water, which prompted my wife to pull the hostess aside and politely ask her to move us or give us better service.  After that, the service wasn't bad. Too bad we couldn't say the same about the food. Sure, the huge biscuits coated in honey were good, but the other two items we tried needed a lot of work. The crab cake chowder had a decent crab cake placed in the soup bowl -- not jumbo lump crab, just the shredded meat parts. The chowder was devoid of potatoes, had very little corn and was so thick that it was more pudding than soup.  The roasted butternut squash with mushroom risotto was some of the most bland, unappealing risotto I've ever had and the flavor of the dish was completely over-powered by a heaping mound of sundried tomatoes. The lightly battered shrimp that was in the dish was decent and the asparagus may have been the best tasting thing on the plate.  The presentation of the food is much more impressive than the taste. Clearly, in the case of the items I tried, it was quantity over quality. The amount of food is absurd and one appetizer and one entree could have been enough to feed four.  Despite mediocre service and subpar food, the worst thing about HHAGG was the bathroom. It was about as dirty as a frat house on a Sunday morning -- trash and toilet paper all over the floor, floors that looked flooded from a backed-uped toilet, and the parts of the floor that weren't flooded were sticky like a movie theater floor.  Hash House might be worth the wait for breakfast, but I would pass on dinner.",

Freakin' bomb. I've recommended it to two other people and it was a hit for both of them!   This time around I had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, which was pretty good too. I'm not going to go into it because other people have described it thoroughly. It really looks like a hot mess and I'm sure some Top Chef judge would probably be appalled by the busyness of the dish. I think all food groups were covered in this dish. Thought I could tackle this thing, but only ate half. You'd probably have to share this meal with someone or you'll end up with leftovers (which isn't always a bad thing!)   The mango coconut pancake is something that I probably will have every time I eat here. When I told our server that I was ordering it for my three year-old, she said, \"It's pretty huge.\" I replied, \"Yup, we're sharing it!\" Even though it was a shared piece, we still went home with half of it.   I failed to mention that perhaps the main reason why I couldn't eat all of my food was because I had a Blood Mary. It's definitely a meal in itself. It was sinfully good and perfectly balanced. Wished I could've taken my leftover drink with me:D   If you're going to eat here, make sure you come with an empty stomach and loose pants!!",

The hostess said she would ask the manger, we explained to the hostess that the vouchers were from the Hilton hotels but they included the hash house at the linq. They said they would take them... We got there and sat in separate tables because we were a big party and didn't want to wait long. Service and food were good but when it was time to pay we gave the voucher to the waitress and told her the story. The manager which had said we were fine to use them then came to the table and said they didn't accept them but would only take one from us so I said ok that's fine. Afterwards when our other half of the party was gonna pay the manger got upset because they were trying to use the same vouchers we had received from the hotel. I understood that there was a miscommunication over the phone and they couldn't use them. But the manager ( little manly looking lady) came over with an attitude and treating us like we are trying to play a trick on her and eat without paying. To the manager, first off you probably don't own the place so don't get your panties in a bunch over something that doesn't affect your life. Secondly, a good manager has better communication skills. No one in either party was giving her an attitude or being rude for her to take an aggressive and defensive tone. She told us that she wasn't going to take their voucher and that she was just gonna take ours and that's it! And we told her that's fine. At no time did we give her a hard time or resist to pay. She treated us like we didn't want to pay. My suggestion for this manager is that she should go take some communication classes at a school and to learn how to control her emotions when dealing with customers. She might cause the restaurant to lose more customers. Stay calm next time girl, the way you handle situations shows lack of experience and expertise.",

Had read great reviews and many a celebrity have endorsed it.  The interior is great and the service is pretty good too. That is why I gave Hash 3 stars, but the food did not appeal that much to me and I consider it forgetable. I tried the mushroom and goat cheese sandwich and have no complaints about my dish, The potatoes au gratin looked very cheesy, but tasted good as the cheese wasn't not all overpowering as I had expected. My wife tried the chicken and waffles and we both agreed: nothing special! The all white meat chicken and waffles were both too dry and bland and we prefer Roscoe's for sure.   For the average 'white' person, this food probably tastes great, the presentation looked above par, but for those among us who consider themselves foodies, the wide gamut of Asian food offered in this city is soo much more appealing. And finally their lunch prices are a little high at $38 for two. Again, this is just my honest opinion.",

However, I was not a fan of its burger. The patties were dry and overcooked. Yes, it was huge, but no, it was not as tasty as it looked. It did not come with fries and to add a side of happy meal portion fries, we had to pay 2.99 more. Plus, our waiter spilled 1/3 of the fries on the table by accident and he just walked away.

So we had a table by ourselves and I knew it was only because we had kids with us but our kids are behaved. We ordered the chicken Rosemary which is our usual favorite. When it came out the food looked like it had just been sitting under a heating lamp. The cheese was melted but hardened up again I guess I didn't even know that was possible. The food wasn't hot at all our drinks were never refilled and we weren't checked on at all. I'm sure whoever thought we weren't going to tip I was surprised when we left a $20 tip on a $40 check. the management should definitely train their staff to not judge people by their looks and treat everyone the same and the kitchen definitely need some training on putting out hot food and not old food that's been sitting under a heating lamp. we will stick to the San Diego location from now on.",

However, once we were seated we had to wait 25 minutes to order drinks, and place our order (we did both at the same time).  Finally after waiting another 25-30 minutes we got our food.  I'm sorry but spending an hour and half to get mediocre food is just lame.  I got a portabello burger with home fried potatoes.  I love the breakfast potatoes which is why I want to come.  Since I had never been for lunch I thought I would try a lunch item.  It sucked.  I didn't' get any sauce or cheese because of dairy..but they did not even offer any alternates. The end result was a bland lunch.  This place is cute for breakfast, and fun to go to look at the epic food portions.  But after this past experience I won't come back or recommend it.",

The food is amazing and the portions are the largest ive ever seen. The pancake was the size of a place mat and was filled with delicious whole bananas, and the chicken and waffles was awesome! It was better than Roscoes! The chicken was juicy and the waffles were infused with whole strips of bacon. The servers were friendly and helpful. Overall it was amazing and you have not had breakfast until you have eaten at Hash House A Go Go!",

We had meatloaf sandwich on milk bread with salad, sage chicken benedict, tractor special and benedict home style.  Not one of us finished and no one had a bad meal.  We all had beer too.  Mmmmm.  I had a Arrogant Bastard Ale that was terrific.    You know what is messed up....we live in Indiana and this place is to originate like 20 min from us and there is NO Hash House A Go Go here.....WTH?????    Anyhow, get your a$$ to a Hash House without hesitation!!!  MMMMMMMMMM!!!!",

The Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles was 4x the size at other places and has BACON BAKED DIRECTLY INTO THE WAFFLES! That is amazing. 4 stars for sure and would have been 5 stars if not for the crazy long waits.   While you are there try their huge Bloody Mary's - only $8.50 and 2x the normal size.",

    "text": "This was the only highlight of my stay in the hotel. On our last day we wanted to go out with a heavy breakfast before the long drive back to Los Angeles.   Our wait was about 35 minutes but totally worth it.  Food portions are GIGANTIC! In order to really enjoy your food, you need a appetite.  The slogan does not lie in terms of a twist on farm food. The inside as well is very well set up in terms of feeling like you are in a upscale diner with farm twist to it.  This may have been the best breakfast experiance I have ever had, especially for the right price.  My girlfriend for starters got a S'Mores mocha that looked like a Frankenstein creation of a drink. Marshmallow was melted on top with chocolate and graham cracker mixed in it. The drink was huge and we did not want to touch it since it looked too good to drink. We started to actually sip it with a spoon like soup because of the sheer size and an inch deep layer of marshmallow on top. I highly, highly recommend the drink.  In terms of what I ate, I got the french toast which came with 3 giant slices of french toast, scrambled eggs, half a fried banana and two big strawberries. I could not finish my meal because I was so full.  No exaggerations here on size of food.   Whenever a server walked by with someones food, people at other tables would be staring at the mere size and display of the food. When I was walking out, I saw some giant sandwich or sorts with a even larger knife sticking in the  middle of it. The displays of food sets this place apart from any other breakfast joint.  I can't wait to come back here.",

Not only that, but they fold in so much flavor into the food!!  Love this place, and so does everyone else so be prepared for a wait.  The pancakes are as big as a steering wheel.  They are very well flavored and just the perfect twist to a breakfast classic.  But breakfast doesn't stop there.  The chicken and waffles I enjoyed ...seriously I had to take an aspirin afterwards b/c I felt heart palpitations from all the fat/carbs/overload!  Another great selection is fried chicken benedict.  It has everything you want out of a meal.  Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, biscuit, gravy, eggs, DELISH!  The wait staff was very friendly and very honest in their opinion of what's good and not good on the menu.    Plenty of parking.  Bathrooms are clean.  Staff is friendly.  Atmoshere is casual.  Great place to bring your kids...they can scream and it's so noisy...you won't hear them. Mmmm enjoy that chicken and waffles my friend ;)",

I've still never been for breakfast but I did order a couple breakfast dishes for dinner and was not disappointed. The crispy salmon dish is not only delicious it's also healthy which I'm not sure you can say for the rest of the menu.

No line, super service, and enough awesome food to replenish the previous day's ridiculous caloric expenditure.  We had specialty drinks all around, including the Oreo mocha (so good my non-coffee fan husband sucked the whole thing down), banana latte (delish!), and a blueberry lemonade that my dad loved.  The food portions are epic.  The selections are creative and oh-so-tasty that it'll kill you to not be able to finish.  Most of the breakfast items strike me as superb hangover/post mass alcohol consumption delights (fitting for any LV breakfast haunt), but are still well-suited for a non-inebriated experience as well.  The scramble with the salmon and brie was amazing.  The crispy potatoes are quite good, but the griddled mash puts up a darn good fight.  The chicken and waffles are more of a visual novelty, but are still pretty good.  They had an awesome special scramble that included a delicious lump crab cake on top - total yum!",

The food was delicious and they do not skimp on the portions.  I had Andy's sage fried chicken benedict with bacon, biscuits, eggs and mashed potatoes, with a delicious creamy, spicy sauce. The plate was humongous and the layers had to be held together with an enormous steak knife. Delicious, delicious, delicious. My mouth is watering as I think about it.   My husband had a pecan blueberry flapjack the size of a tire, which was tasty, but more impressive because of its size than anything. Friends had the house hash special (delicious) and the chicken and waffles (yum!). The waffles had bacon INSIDE them (brilliant!).   I definitely can't wait to go back. Sure, I felt like a whale afterward, but so worth it.",

    "text": "Next time I visit Hash House, I will make sure I will be in town that night, so that I may nap after eating and drinking my brunch.  This location is off the strip, with easy access parking and REALLY GOOD Coffee! Most diners have so-so coffee, but Hash House A Go Go serves Lavaza Drip Coffee and Espresso drinks, with alcohol added, if you so desire. Everything ordered was yummy. My friend ordered the Tractor Driver Combo with french toast. I generally despise banana toppings, but enjoyed the sliced fried bananas on top, which I have named \"better than bananas.\"  The best parts of my Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict were the crispy fried mashed potatoes, and the chipotle hollandaise sauce. Mixed together, they were better than bacon! (And I reeeeally love bacon!) I am not a big fan of fried chicken, so while I did appreciate the quality of Hash House's chicken, I would recommend a different Benedict dish for non chicken lovers.  A couple friends shared tales of long waits and mediocre service at the Imperial Palace location, however, we received excellent service with no wait at this location...around noon.  I shall return!",

I recently paid them a visit on June 1 at the location on Sahara Las Vegas.I was seated outside with my wife , as it was very busy and we took first available seat. Wait staff outside was a little overworked. My wife ordered an omelet and it came ten minutes before my food. No butter or anything for biscuit and by the time my food came hers was cold. My main huge complaint is I ordered the chicken and waffles beautiful presentation nothing more cold everything chicken cold waffle soggy just bad in every way did look awesome but horrible to eat! Very disappointed as we drove from the Red Rock Resort and could have picked anyplace.",

I went with a group of friends. I ordered the \"signature\" chicken and waffles. My other friends ordered fried chicken salad and one of the stuffed burgers.  All in all, we were all disappointed in our dishes. The food had little to no flavor to them. They looked amazing, but tasted terrible for what you paid for. The salad was pretty much a simple salad with a piece of bland fried chicken thrown on top of it. The burger had no flavor to it at all. The fried chicken on my waffles were also flavorless. The waffles were a bit dry too.  We had a table of people across from us walk out after complaining to the waiter about how bad the food was. I didn't think the food was THAT bad, but I don't think I ever want to come back here.  I'd think that this place would be more busy on a Saturday night, but it was pretty empty. Now I can see why. It's not a place worth coming back to.  A+ for the presentation of the food D- for serving this as food",

There are many things you can choose from, it is mainly known for breakfast so I went for the chicken and waffles, one of their specialties. I would give the food an OK. rating. My waffles looked like they had fallen in grass with all the lettuce they used to decorate the waffles. Mimosas were mediocre and the overall service was just average. Our waiter was forgetful on the condiments and refilling the soda. It was pretty busy so I won't rate the service harshly. Overall, I may CONSIDER coming back, but may just look elsewhere.",

    "text": "As a Las Vegas local, I was very excited to finally go to breakfast here after hearing so much about it from various sources (Man vs. Food, other locals, etc.).  Went with friends who are also locals and was their first experience eating here as well.  Wait time:  Great...10 mins  Decor/Atmosphere:  hip/fun/great  Food:  \"HH Original Farm Benedict was visually pleasing presentation-wise, portion size was large, but tasted very plain and average.  Roasted Red Pepper cream sauce wasn't a plus to this dish.  Unimpressive (according to my friend who ordered this dish).  \"Tractor Driver Combo\" (2 eggs w/ bacon and vanilla waffle version ordered) was nothing special/plain and over-priced for what you get ($12.95).  No garnish on the plate whatsoever with the exception of one strawberry on top of the waffle.  Two of us ordered this dish (we each had our own) and felt exactly the same way about it.  Small orange juice ordered tasted like the kind that comes out of a machine and was way over-priced ($3.75).  We all ordered coffee. One person in our group took the first sip and immediately noticed a glob of old caked-on red lipstick on the rim of her cup.  Disgusting!  She asked for a new cup of coffee.  Server did not apologize nor seem to care...just brought a replacement cup. In my opinion, one cup of coffee should have been comped on our bill at the end of the meal, no questions asked, but that was not the case.  Service:  Very poor.  Server was not friendly whatsoever.  This was so unexpected, especially given the \"notoriety\" of the restaurant.  t's not like you work at Denny's!  I asked if it was possible to get fruit/strawberries to go with my waffle when I ordered, and the server's response was \"there's one strawberry that comes on top of the waffle\".  Any other communication out of the server's mouth consisted of what seemed like \"grunts\" with an attitude of \"I really could care less whether any of you enjoy your breakfast\". Took at least 20 mins before our food arrived at the table after having placed our order.  All in all, the experience was a let down, and I so wish it had been otherwise.",

However, in the last two months, we have stopped going as the last 3 times we went, the meat and eggs were entirely TOO greasy for some reason and the waffle was doughy (not cooked enough) and my french toast was burned.  It takes an incredibly long time to get food re-done and honestly, I have to evaluate if the value is there as the breakfasts are pricey.  I don't need a ton of food, just good quality of food as they used to have.  I gave them three stars as everyone should try them once, and my hope is they return to quality as then I will gladly return to the restaurant.  Until then, so many other places to have breakfast in Vegas for far less $. We also tried them for dinner to see if there was a difference with the kitchen perhaps but nope, over salted food and my now my bacon and french toast were both burned....twenty minutes later, still chasing the server to check on our food.......dropping another star on this review soon.......",

    "text": "Whaaaat?  Friends recommended this, Yelp had pretty solid reviews, and we got a great vibe upon entering.  The place was packed, which is always a good sign, and we lucked out to find a spot immediately at the bar.  I have to say that despite it being a busy holiday weekend, the service at the bar was impeccable.  They were engaging, friendly, and clearly working their tails off.    That's where the good stuff ended though.  The menu looked great at first glance, and we had a difficult time deciding what to order... so we asked for help from the bartender.  She recommended the fried chicken, biscuit, potato breakfast dish.  It seemed like a good choice, but when it arrived, it was honestly just too much.  Too many components... too large of portions... you honestly couldn't tell where one thing started and another thing ended.  It was just a huge bunch of slop on a plate.  We shared it, and there was still plenty leftover.  I think if they had a more restrained concept of the dish, it would've worked so much better.  The mimosas (tangerine and pineapple) were okay.  I wish we would've tried one of the delicious looking iced coffee drinks we saw headed to other tables.  But, with our lack-of-luck with the meal, we decided to just call it a day and head out!",

I got the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit which was pretty good. The only reason I knocked off a star is because many of the menu items can be a bit pricey. Most of the plates range from $13-$17 each dish. I also like how many of the breakfast platters are served in the actual skillet that they used to cook the food in. It was a fun experience, but I do not think I will be coming back here for awhile.",

Drink - I strongly recommend the Bloody Mary, even if you don't like them try someone's in the group you go with if possible and I think they will change your mind.  It's a bit spicy and is not tomato-y.  It's just 100% awesome.  Every trip to Vegas gets me to this place just for this drink at least once, its a must have.  Food - I've tried a couple different dishes and Andy's Sage Chick is my favorite.  Piled high with awesomeness, fried chicken, chipotle sauce, bacon and eggs.  If you go during peak hours prepare yourself to wait, its worth it but you will be standing there for a while.  Peak hours from my observation is weekends and nights.",

Both are absolutely delicious and there is no need to order anything else on the menu (I'm sure the rest is good though).  My wife loves the chicken and waffles, and gets either that or the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. I keep telling myself that I'm going to try something new, but I never do.

My favorite thing to order here is the Griddled French toast.  They are 4 huge slices on this dish and it comes with fried Plantin bananas.  They already add the syrup for you and they actually put a good amount.  Of course they offer extra syrup and butter for your taste.  My cousins ordered the Chicken Eggs Benedict, and the BBBLT (bacon bacon bacon Lettuce Tomato sandwhich).  Again, portions huge!    We were actually able to order all different things and share family style.  I think that's cool.  All the food was yummy! The benedict biscuit bread was a tad bit thick so it kind of took away flavor from all the other stacks on top of it.  I hate when I can't taste the egg!  This is definitely the place to take someone who loves to eat breakfast or brunch.  Entertain them with the huge plates!  Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (59/365).",

My friend says it best... this place makes men want to consider breaking man-laws and taking the most blasphemous of measures... asking another man to share a meal with him.  I found that not only is steroids being found in baseball, cycling, Olympics, etc.  the world of food is on steroids as well.  Hash House is as blatant as Barry Bonds.   The words I think of when thinking about the meals found here...bountiful, steroids, grazing, hearty, heart-attack, eccentric, eye-opening, scary, etc.  The fried chicken is plump and juicy.  The eggs are plump and juicy.  The sausage is plump and juicy.  The waffles are plump and juicy.  The French toast is plump and juicy.   I prefer the French toast over the waffles because they were more fluffy.  I didn't try the flapjacks because they freaked me out.  Pancakes the size of a medium pizza is no joke.  Maybe next time though.  Still want to try the watermelon kiwi lemonade as well.  Amazingly, I didn't get any food coma symptoms afterwards.  I guess that's what steroids does to you.  No down time baby!  I love how the platters come out with a knife stabbed into the food... \"OJ style\"",

Funny thing ids I read reviews before I went and every single person just about only referred the sage chicken and waffles. I thought to myself this place can not survive on the alone. So the culinary explorer such as myself went a different approach. I ordered the rib eye steak which was very expensive and way not worth it. The meatloaf, bbq ribs ,spaghetti, hamburger.

    "text": "Ferb and I finally put down the hookahs and set aside the other unmentionable things and decided a road trip to the \"Sin City\", Las Vegas was due.   After a couple of all nighters out and about it wasn't until the last day of our trip that we decided to go to Hash House a go-go. Walking in and being mesmorized by the vast amount of pictures staring back at us, we made our way to the table.  As we sat, we noticed a gigantic edible sombrero looking dish that had some kind of delicious food in it. Then and there I knew that this was going to be a place that would get our alcohol drenched insides back to a legal state.  As we got our menu, we closely examined what each meal consisted of. Even though it was late afternoon, our drenched insides were burning yearning for breakfast, with a salad on the side.  A few words to describe that god damn delicious salad. \"Oh my, yum yum then some!\" The CROUTONS, tasted like they came down from the heavens on a lovely white cloud with trumpets blaring announcing that they have made it to the party, also known as the house salad. Word to the wise though, Do not eat, however tempting it might be, do not eat the sticks that accompany that heavenly salad.  Not even halfway through eating the heavenly salad, Ferb's tractor breakfast combo, with the biggest pancake known to man, along with eggs, potato and a scrumptious strawberry, came to the table first.  A couple of minutes later, Phineas's mountain of eggs, biscuit and potato joined in. After stealing a couple of Phineas's food, I knew it was the start of a food coma.  One delicious bite after another, I came to the realization that this was the cure of the alcohol and other unmentionable things that we needed. Bang for the buck, this is the place, and we needed this after a crazy night at the penny slots. That's a whole different story.  45 minutes of nonstop eating ended up in laying down on the benches outside the restaurant. With the strip in our sights we knew it was time for more alcohol and penny slots.  We are in Vegas.......  To be continued.......",

Most of us had luke warm food, but I was too lazy (since it felt like forever to get our food), to cry about it and send it back.   More like a 3-4 range, but the flavor and temperature were lacking.  They do have an awesome smores mocha that you should probably share. Actually, share anything you order because the portion will be monster. We came for Brunch on a Friday and had a short wait.   Best thing was probably my friend's banana french toast. That was tasty and the broiled (?) bananas were the perfect addition.  Would I go again for that price? Probably not. Maybe the San Diego sister location would be better....",

    "text": "After seeing the Man vs. Food episode, I knew I had to check this place out. Not because of it's sudden celebrity status, but because of the amazing menu that serves my favorite meal of the day- breakfast all day long...more like Breakfast, Brunch, and Brinner :-)   I know there are 2 locations in Vegas. I was told the original building is small, dark, and not so glamorous, but honestly it's all about the food with me. Since I didn't have a car, the location on the strip at Imperial Palace, that I believe opened in January, was perfect! The casino itself was not very admirable, but Hash House upstairs was bright and clean. We went on a Sunday around noon, so I was afraid that we would have to wait a while, but I don't think we waited longer than 15 minutes.   This place is not for the faint of heart, so let me start off by first saying that we were warned about the portions. Usually, I have no problems with that, but DAMN! There were four of us- the two, more experienced Hash House a Go-Goers were smart and shared the Man vs. Food favorite: Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. My friend ordered the same thing, and I, of course, known to be a whore for chicken and waffles ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles- NY Times favorite. Starting with the Benedict dish, it actually had a lot of my favorite things all thrown together on a plate, but in my opinion, it was a bit overwhelming with all the different flavors. The fried chicken was amazing, it had a nutty taste and texture that I enjoyed. My were waffles w/cooked bacon in between was a delightful surprise. My only gripe with that dish was they did not supply enough syrup! However, it was quite a sight to see a tower of waffles and chicken placed before me. Needless to say, none of us hardly finished. The couple with us nearly did and my friend and I each walked away stuffed with leftovers for the rest of the day!  Service was decent for being extremely busy. I had to ask twice for extra syrup, but I'm not really into the whole making a scene or letting some insignificant thing ruin my meal, so whatever, I'm patient and can wait. The prices are excellent for the portions you receive, both a good and a bad thing. The mimosas were so-so, I've had better. This is definitely a place I'd GO-GO to again to try other dishes, but thankfully they don't have any Hash Houses out here yet, otherwise I'd bust my belt!",

Went there on a Saturday AM for brunch I guess. 12:30 arrived and the place was packed.   Bar was hopping with a ton of people getting blood mary's & mojitos. Friend got a bloody mary, it was huge & only 7 bucks. Wait was 30 minutes, but since we made the effort to venture off the strip we were committed.   Looking @ the menu literally 80% of it caught my interest. I settled on the \"crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin w/ market yellow tomato, spinach, barb'que cream and topped w/ scrambled eggs\" copy & pasted straight from their website. But my goodness it was amazing and I was breathing heavy in between bites to finish the thing off.  A must now for me & my buddies that can eat when we're in Vegas. Didn't know there was 1 in San Diego so looking forward to trying that 1 as well.",

    "text": "Just got back from Vegas, Baby! OK. I'll stop that in a few more minutes, but it's really fun to say.  On Sunday, my BF and I went to Hash House a Go Go for brunch. We arrived a little after 10 AM and were told that there was a 15 minute wait. The wait ended up being more like 25 minutes and BF does not wait well.   Our server was great. Our coffee and water arrived within a couple minutes. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash. I figure that if this is a hash house they should be able to do this right. This was without a doubt the best corned beef hash I've ever eaten.  It came out on a platter. When people say that the portions are generous, that's an understatement. The corned beef was shredded, mixed with swiss cheese and put it over these amazing potatoes. It was served with a real biscuit and eggs. I like my eggs over hard. I hate runny yolks. I've sent eggs back at many a fine establishment. THIS PLACE GOT MY EGGS RIGHT!!!  BF got a pumpkin cranberry waffle. It was huge. Served with butter and whipped cream. Yummy! There was so much food that we ended up switching place, he finished my hash and I finished his waffle.  The next time I go to Vegas, this is going to be a regular stop. Even BF admitted that the food was worth the wait.   This place knows how to make a fat girl happy!",

The tastes of the warm biscuit (with fruit topping) and rich mashed potatos really took me back to my childhood.  The portions are HUGE, you'll probably need a to go box.  Cost is low considering the value.  The bill for two people with a 25% tip was $53.    I thought it was interesting that they don't have heat lamps, so food gets delivered to your table as it's ready.  REALLY that's how it should be, everyone gets their food as fresh as possible.  The presentation of the food is very thoughtful and the taste is rich (heavy, southern style).  Don't expect to eat for the rest of the day, you'll likely be too full! :-)  I had a mint latte here that was one of the best I have ever tasted (and I've had tons of lattes)!    Our waitress \"Kai,\" (short hair, enthusiastic) was super nice and helpful.  We saw her stand on top of a chair to take a picture of a large party at a table- that's service!  We'll be back and likely ask to be seated in her section. :-)",

The wait was shorter but the food was just as good as the one located on the Strip. If you're on a diet, this place isn't for you. The portions are HUGE! They don't mess around here. Hash House offers a variety of good meal options but I usually go with the Sage Fried Chicken. It's the best item they have in the menu (at least in my humble opinion). Don't be fooled by the \"Chicken Breast\" label because this meal is not healthy by any means. Deep fried and topped off with waffles and maple syrup...it's a heart attack waiting to happen.  But it's OH SO GOOD!  Hash House is a must stop for me whenever I am in town. This was my first time at this particular location and after coming here, I think that this will be my go to location moving forward.   Hash House...you never disappoint!",

My husband had the griddled meatloaf and I don't think he's ever been so quiet during a meal. I did sneak one bite from him and then I understood why he didn't speak. He didn't want to waste any time while eating it.   Our server was very friendly and although he appeared to have 5+ tables, he took care of all of us with ease.

Second, don't you think its a little weird that the salad comes with a biscuit? Well, luckily I asked for a side of gravy and made myself biscuit and gravy. Did not like the gravy what so ever. Way to thick and too salty for my liking, I'm not a huge sausage lover, I just like the flavor in huge sauce not big, two inch pieces. I guess I'm a biscuit and gravy snob.  Tried a few bites if my husband stuffed burger and holy burger was it tasty. Double patty filled with cheddar cheese,avacado and bacon. Perfect combo.  My step dad wasn't too happy with his since he ordered the eggs Benedict and it came with a tomato sauce on top instead of the traditional sauce, he still ate it but said he wouldn't order it again,",

The watermelon lemonade is such a pretty drink you hate to stir it up. We also had the Bloody Mary BLT which was hilariously fun and delicious! We started off with the friend green tomato and chicken salad appetizer. Again the presentation is jaw dropping but the flavor combination was so exciting on your tongue. The swirl of balsamic with the chicken salad was spectacular. We all ordered something different and had \"to go\" boxes because of the understood extreme portion sizes. The sage chicken penne was excellent but you have to like the flavor of sage. It's powerful! The chicken was moist and the batter was golden in color and crisp. The crab cake sandwich was not lump meat but more like a pureed patty. It was good but I would suggest getting the side salad instead of the fries. It's a mound of fries and by the time you eat some they are cold. We also had the pepper jack burger and the chicken biscuits and gravy. The burger is a double patty party and you can't finish it! The chicken biscuits is so comforting with the mound of mashed potatoes, the veggies are very flavorful and make you think you are eating healthy. I loved the gravy which was smooth, not spicy but so creamy. The negative part about this place is I wished to try the dessert but it is absolutely impossible!! We rolled out of there and I can't imagine the calorie count of our meal or how much weight we gained. I do love this place for the fun creative crazy people, dishes and drinks. Definitely go and plan to eat the leftovers for two days!",

I used to live in Vegas and never got out there mainly because I was always working during the week and my friend (who worked there) said that it was a VERY long wait on the weekends so don't bother. I was visiting Vegas and went to the restaurant during the week and it was perfect. We only waited 5 minutes and were seated.  The food is GREAT. I'm not sure why, but the server would take a long time taking orders so could not check back on us.  Why does this surprise me? They don't take special orders so you have to order as it is on the menu. Anyhow, the food makes up for this. The portions are humongous. We took our leftovers back to our condo and were able to enjoy them later.  Great theme, great staff, great vibe!",

Sage chicken a savory explosion along with the best waffles in Vegas, a tad of smokey bacon infused lovingly in each waffle.  When we have company the kids have a blast here.  Leave full.  Totally worth the price. Wait times vary  Waitstaff is cool",

I had the Banana Latte to drink and he had the Caramel Mocha coffee.  Service was friendly and the waiter was personable.  The food is great and the portions are plentiful; really pretty large, as seen in pictures.    I can't comment on lunch/dinner type foods since both entrees we ordered were breakfast items.  The sage fried chicken was good but dry in some parts.  The bacon waffles under the chicken had a hint of vanilla in them but were overall pretty bland actually.  With syrup and other food items on the plate, the dryness of the waffles is not unbearable.  The maple syrup is heated and served in a small steel cup.  Fried leeks top the chicken and waffles as well as some diced peppers for garnish and the signature stick of rosemary.  The Sage Fried Chicken [eggs] benedict has an awesome chipotle sauce, not too spicy, just right.  The mashed potatoes were pretty good.  The egg is almost forgotten in this dish, but it is there, with a layer of cheese too.  Our espresso drinks were excellent...I definitely recommend the Banana Latte.  If I went again I would order only one Sage Fried Chicken dish and try something new.",

I did't expect the service would be so great, but she was good. We ordered chicken waffles, a burger, and man vs. food favorite. 6 of us ordered 4 dishes to share. It still was too much and we had leftover. (We didn't even touch man v. food favorite)   Food was amazing. Chicken was crispy and the waffles were gigantic! The BEST chicken and waffles. Burger was great too. Man v. food favorite.. It was too much. After eating chicken and waffles and a humongous burger, man v. food favorite was out of my sight. Overall, it was too much but too good.   Service was okay. Can't complain about it here. But not 5 stars.",

It was at least a half an inch thick by 12 inches. I thought it would be no problem for me to kill this thing, since the last time, I was here, I completely finished an Original Farm Benedict, and still had room for dessert. Must be getting old - I took half of it home and had it for breakfast the next morning. Spiked Watermelon Kiwi Juice was refreshing - ordered it with an extra shot of vodka. This meal was definitely carb overload. My desire for pancakes has been satiated for the year - hopefully.",

    "text": "Many restaurants have very poor presentation with their various food dishes. This is not the case with Hash House. Hash House has great presentation and their portions are gigantic. You can really get TOO full if you eat your whole meal in one sitting. This being said, the flavor of their various dishes is surprisingly not that great, which truly surprises me. One would think that with their eye for detail they would also take a closer look at their food preparation. But, that's just my opinion...  In terms of location and seating: there can be no doubt, this restaurant is a Las Vegas hot spot. On the central portion of Sahara Ave., close to everything, a lot of people come here. Their parking lot is easy to access but it can get crowded.   Hash House A Go Go is a large restaurant with a nice atmosphere, that has a lot of seating. For the most part the seating is well spaced giving you plenty of room to enjoy your food, drink, and conversation. I recommend asking for a booth where you will have more privacy instead of one of the free standing tables in their central dining area. They also have outdoor seating. The weather permitting, you can sit outside if you desire.   As Hash House is a LV hot spot, expect a wait if you come during peak hours. The one thing I will say is that even if there is a wait they seat you quickly and the time they tell you your wait will be is the time you wait. They are not like one of those restaurants where their standard answer is ten minutes and you wait thirty.  Overall, Hash House is a place to eat but not a great place to eat.",

Under neither it was very dry     stuffing or something, and with bell peppers and on the bottom was a       again a thin layer of very dry ground beef.  4- The last time I had the meatloaf it was actually a very large       portion of ground beef that was very moist and tasteful and it was       served with a side of mash potatoes .Not sure if it was a new cook or       they decided to change the way they make the meatloaf 5- Today I found out the other person who also ordered the meatloaf      ended up not feeling well this morning.",

Without a doubt everything is very hearty and filling.   The corn beef hash was very moist and flavorful. The chicken was a bit dry but still good none the less. Smoked salmon was good but I don't think I'd get it again.   Service was horrible. We sat for 10 mins before a server came to us and asked for drink. It was a gentleman with black gauges in his ear. He repeatedly asked if we needed anything but would never bring it.  It wasn't until a very kind lady with short blonde hair took our order and actually took our order. She took our drink and food order very quickly and it came out in a timely fashion although, no one came over to us to ask how our food was.  I asked the gentleman with the gauges for an extra plate and he never brought it along with the waters we ordered through him.   Overall, food was great, but service was non-existent. I don't feel the need to tip if our server(s) only take our order, bring us our food and give us our check without checking up on us or any refills for water.",

If you're looking for a great meal, with good prices this is your place.    I've been coming here for years at this location, and it has never disappointed.  The first time I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  It was love at first sight!  I've been back many times, and tried much of the rest of the menu, but this is still my favorite.  The rest of the menu has been great, don't get me wrong, but my favorite is my favorite.  The servers are always friendly and quick with refills on drinks.  The food is so quickly cooked it makes me often wonder if they have mind readers scanning the cars as they pull into the lot.  It is a few miles away from the strip, but the locations at the Rio and Linq are usually pretty great as well.  When I have out of town guests, I love bringing them here, and every one of them has said, next time they're in town, we have to go back!  I would suggest this to anyone looking to fill up on a great meal.  If it's late at night, go to the one in the Linq, it's open 24 hours.  But if it is during the hours this one is open, I would whole-heartedly recommend making the trek here.",

It had a better setting and the food was made with quality and not rushed due to overbooked reservations. I can't wait to come back I wish they would expand to Los Angeles",

I think I laughed out loud at the size of the pancake that was brought to me.   I do not remember the exact name of what I ordered but it was 2 eggs, potatoes and this mega pancake. The meal could easily be split between two or three people. Then again it was so delicious I'm not sure I would want to share. The pancake arrived and was by far the best pancake I have ever eaten and the potatoes were seasoned perfectly. The service was attentive and friendly. I didn't give them 5 starts because the menu is a bit overwhelming. There is so much going on it made it a little tricky to select what to order.   In a nutshell... Good service Nice location Plenty of parking Huge huge huge portions, be prepared to share.",

    "text": "Hash House a Go Go is by far my favorite brunch spot of all times (minus the wait). My last review isn't up to my personal standard so I definitely wanted to update with a more helpful/useful review!   On my most recent visit to Vegas to see my Vegas Favs, the four of us came on a Saturday and the wait was only about 25-35minutes. Not too bad at all!!   We were helped by Nick!! He was awesome!! I could tell that he was very busy with many other tables but he was still positive, cheerful, upbeat and attentive to our table.   We ordered 2 Andy Sage Fried Chicken ($13.50/each) a Tractor Driver Combo ($13.50) with scrambled eggs, bacon, crispy potatoes and ($1 upgrade for a Hash House famous flapjack) a Brown Sugar Banana Flapjack and another Tractor Driver Combo ($13.50) with scrambled eggs, sausage and ($1 upgrade for a Hash House famous flapjack) an Apple Cinnamon Flapjack. For drinks we ordered 3 Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade ($5.50 each) and a Banana Latte ($5.99).  My Andy Sage Fried Chicken was AMAZING!!!!!! The portions here are huge and I was able to each this for multiple meals :D It is served with a layer of mashed potatoes on the bottom, then two biscuits, tomatoes, bacon, the huge fried chicken, 2 scrambled eggs on top. And all of that loveliness and covered in their tasty special sauce. I highly recommend this item!! I think Man vs Food even featured this item of one of their episodes!!!   My friends really enjoyed their Tractor Driver Combos but it was too HUGE!! They were only able to stuff down half  of their order, but the flapjacks aren't ideal to togo. I would recommend sharing this item if you order it :)   You can't come here without trying their award winning Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade!!!!!!! It is refreshing, well balanced AND pretty for the camera. I think you can pay more and get a souvenir cup from Hash House if you order this beverage :)   Good service, reasonable prices, LARGE portions and DELICIOUS food!!!!!! What more can I ask for?!?! :D",

Brought 5 other people with and strongly urged them not to order the Chicken n Waffles as I had to have them again, but wanted to see (taste) some other offerings lol.   As others have indicated the portions are HUGE! Many doggie bags were assembled last night.   Chicken n waffles are excellent! (Chicken is bone in). The waffles have big pieces of bacon inside!  The fu fu looking Kiwi watermelon lemonade is delicious. (I went with the adult version -a shot of vodka)  Round the table there was meatloaf pasta - delicious...the hammered pork loin - Amazing!....the stuffed meatloaf -awesome!...and finally the breakfast crab cakes ...best crab cakes I've tasted!    After our order was taken a plate of huge glazed biscuits arrived with a delicious peach preserve and honey butter.    I'm here for a couple more days, I be back for breakfast later and then await my next trip to start working my way thru the balance of the menu.   Great service, delicious food, priced right, huge portions...do it!",

The Fried Chicken Benedict and the chicken and waffles are definitely the most ordered thing as when you look around at all the other tables you will see at least one or both of these dishes at almost each table so that speaks for itself. The chicken and waffles is light years ahead of other restaurants that offer this dish due to the fact that not only are you getting a massive size but it is a handcrafted tastebud tantalizing extravaganza! The crispy chicken on top of the sweet waffles, perfumed by the rosemary is great. The Fried Chicken Benedict is smothered in the most decadent gravy I've ever tried. Get one or both of these and you won't be disappointed.",

I'd recommend the fried chicken eggs Benedict, but the French toast is too thick and dry. There aren't enough fruits to balance it out.  If you're looking for brunch in Las Vegas you can do better than Hash House I'm sorry to say. Spend your time waiting somewhere else as the line at Hash House is quite long as well.",

A couple years ago I was so excited to go to this restaurant and even got something in the mail with pictures that I brought along with me.  It clearly stated the hours breakfast was served and as far as the ad was concerned we were on time.  However, when we sat down and I tried to order the picture, I was told they don't prepare eggs that way past a certain time of day.  That I could receive eggs prepared the way they said or not at all.  Due to my prior excitement over the picture, and as a customer being told there were eggs in the kitchen, but they would not use them the way they advertised, I was very deflated.  It ruined my appetite, we stood up without ordering or eating and have never been back since.    I am glad to see so many positive reviews, hopefully I will move past my grudge soon and finally try the food that aesthetically appealed to me before.",

    "text": "The Hash House A Go Go has an interesting menu and has been on a travel channel show, but in my opinion, it is more fluff than substance and your typical example of \"sounds better on paper.\"  You get large portions at a premium price for your typical diner (aka Denny's style) food dressed up with a sprig of sage - it's not bad but you might feel a bit disappointed if you were expecting something awesome.  Stay away from some of the gimmicky items, and you will have an experience similar to an IHOP.  As a person who usually orders waffles, I have to say this: order the pancakes.  The waffles have a slight baking soda taste, and when you get the bacon cooked in the waffle, it makes the flavor more pronounced.  Most people are too hung-over or impressed by the serving size to care.  It took me 2 visits to come to the conclusion that decent pancakes trump weird waffles, and trust me, you don't want to order the bacon waffle unless you really like grease.  Despite the yummy sounding menu, the best items to get are their \"regular\" dishes like an omelet or eggs and bacon.  Their food tends to be bland, as if adding salt or ketchup is a requirement.  The chicken is ok for the first couple of bites, but it's actually a bit too dry and bland to enjoy without dipping it in something.  The omelets and pancakes were never bad during my visits.  The service is efficient and professional, though not particularly friendly.  If this place is on your \"Vegas to do List\" then you should try to come during non-peak meal hours to avoid lines and a busy waitress.    I know The Hash House A Go Go tries to create a nice breakfast/diner experience but the inconsistent flavors makes it difficult to really like.  If you're here to experience Vegas, then stick with some basic breakfast or menu items and you should be fine.  It's not a bad place, but I think it is more hype than taste.  There are cheaper and tastier places to have breakfast, but then again, Hash A Go Go does provide some very interesting menu options.  You should go just to see how big some of these dishes are.",

A quick drive from the strip and we arrive to a packed house (outdoors was crowded as well and this was late December)  After an amazing bloody mary at the bar we were seated maybe 15-20 minute wait not bad and all the people working were extremely nice and helpful.  I shared the chorizo hash with someone; this was due to the fact that we saw the portion sizes and i will say they are generous..  The food was beyond amazing, tasty, cooked just right and damn Im sorry I shared.  Someone else ordered the pancakes and I must say \"there as big as your head spider\" Goodfellas quote...and again taste really amazing..  Service is good and the food comes out pretty quickly, the coffee was great, the bloody marys were great..  I will definitely be back",

The last time we were here we couldn't get in for breakfast because the wait was too long and we had to hit the road to get back home.   The first thing that hits you about Hash House is the HUGE servings. We ordered two flapjacks which are literally an inch thick and more than foot wide! I had the Corned Beef Hash served with eggs and potatoes. My wife had the BBBLT, which is a huge BLT sandwich with a huge amount of bacon.   On a good day, if you're lucky, you can eat your whole plate. As happened in the two times we went here, we took back leftovers, which were just as good the next day. Highly recommend making a stop at Hash House A Go Go if you're ever in Vegas.",

It was just a pancake wit blueberries. I also ordered a chicken and waffles, the chicken was great and the flavor everywhere else on the plate was good.

    "text": "Hash House A GoGo is a must go to when coming to Vegas for food.  It is a refreshing alternative to the glut of cheap buffets and overly priced epicurean restaurants.  The portion sizes are humongous as well as having a different twist on homestyle foods.    The sage fried chicken with waffles is always a sure winner.  Fried chkn is always fresh and crisp and the waffles have bacon right int them.  Pour syrup over the whole thing and you come out a winner, unlike the casinos.  Their meatloaf is your standard classic meatloaf, but without any of the cheap meat taste.  The only thing that I didn't care for much in their meatloaf sandwich was the use of canned tomatoes on top.  It gave a very unrefined feel to the whole thing and clashed with the butter toasted milk bread and smoky cheese.  The banana brown sugar pancakes are worth waking up for even if it means you are still hung over.  The pancakes have nice amount of banana in it and are cooked with brown sugar so you get the marvelous crunchy texture with the well-rounded sweetness.    The eggs benedict dishes and hash dishes are piled on high and probably enough for two to share or have another meal out of later.  The kiwi-watermelon lemonade is also a feast for the eyes as it layers into 3 different colors and was the star attraction of our table.    Of course, no one is perfect and we had experienced what many of the other Yelpers had brought up.  Service was really mediocre, and they really did not seem to care.  Our food took over 45 min from the time we ordered and our server said she would get us refills, but would charge us for them.  Great way to comp your customers!  When the food did finally come out, it was one dish at a time at 5 min intervals.  They also messed up our orders.  I think that if you anticipate mediocre service, you should be ok.  Go for the food!",

If you don't want the extra plate charge the servers have told us to order an extra biscuit which is huge and always served with homemade jam (flavors depend on the time of year).  I highly recommend the bacon waffle. It's a normal belgian waffle but has bacon infused into the batter and each corner has a slice of bacon hanging off of it. Life changing.",

Never really gotten full off eggs, toast and sausage, but this place is guaranteed to make you leave happy.    We had the sage fried chicken which tasted really good, the burger here wasn't that great.  The meatloaf hash was good but a lot of potatoes.  The spinach, ham and cheese scramble had a lot of flavor and light.  Waffle was fluffy and huge, they also have a bacon waffle for all you bacon lovers out there.",

    "text": "I saw someone else's review about having a love/hate relationship with Hash House and that's kind of the same feeling that I have.  I generally frequent the Sahara location (as I did this time) but have been to the other locations inside the Plaza Hotel, Imperial Palace and the M Resort.  The Sahara location has by far the best service of all of the locations - the M Resort the WORST.  I think for the cost of the food and what you get that you can't beat it.  This morning - I opted for an Apples and Cinnamon pancake with a Cinnamon Roll Coffee.  The pancake was $7.95 and the coffee $5.25.  I'll admit - the coffee was a bit pricey but it tasted DAMN good, however, if you're not careful - you might end up doing a You Tube cinnamon challenge by mistake because they shake a LOT of cinnamon on top of the whipped cream :)  -- (note to self for the next time). The pancake was great.  It wasn't too heavy and it was filled with slices of fresh apples.  I brought half of it home.  My dining partners ordered the Tractor Combo - with a mango coconut pancake, eggs and .. $11.95 while the other ordered a Big Easy breakfast, eggs, potatoes, sausage and bread.  I'm not sure the price.  We all enjoyed our meal.  My dining partners were here on a mini vacation from California (via Philadelphia originally) and it was great catching up with up with them. The waitress allowed us to sit there for literally 3 hours and shoot the s***.    All in all - good experience today.",

We were seated after about 15 minutes of waiting.  Great service, the waiter was super attentive.  I love a bloody mary & this was one of the best that I've had.  Just the right amount of spice to clear up the massive hangover.  Their juices are great... freshly made, or so I was told.  I had the sage chicken... it was insane.  Huge dish.  Perfectly crispy & the sage was intense but surprisingly good.  I can't wait to go back.",

The best time to go is around 11 AM, when they will usually let you order from both the breakfast and lunch menus - (breakfast menu is better).  For breakfast, I like their scrambles better than the hash. But my favorite for breakfast is the sage fried chicken benedict. It's a huge piece of boneless chicken on top of a buttermilk biscuit, topped with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, bacon and mozzarella cheese. It comes with a side of griddled (mashed) potatoes. It is all drizzled in a chipotle cream sauce, which is a little spicy. IT IS HUGE!! You will be eating leftovers!   For lunch I like the one pound stuffed hamburgers with a side of au gratin potatoes. The ham and egg stuffed hamburger is very good.   Is any of this stuff good FOR you? Probably not. They do have some salads with vinaigrette dressings for the more healthy diets, but most of the menu is heavy meals and outrageous portions.  It's a great place to go for the \"wow\" factor.  The prices are moderate, the quality very good and the staff has been friendly.  We will keep going back and trying new menu items.",

    "text": "You should definitely a-go-go to this restaurant! (I'm sure you all have heard this phrase before) but seriously:   After eating the food, you will also a-go-go (to the restroom).   All three of us had some problems in the restroom after eating the food, but let me tell you, it was worth it! The portions are big and it is considered cheap for that price! There were three of us and we are quite petite, so we could have just ate ONE plate. Talk about deal steal.  It was at about 1:00pm on Labor Day that we reached to the restaurant. They still handed us the breakfast menu. (I didn't know they had other menus until looking at their website- Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner). So, we heard that this place  had HUGE portions. They are not kidding.   We ordered two plates: The oh so famous Sage Fried Chicken with Waffles. They stab the chicken pieces onto to the waffles. Since I am Chinese it wasn't very pleasing to the eye that there is a knife stabbed right into the chicken (signifying death) but the flavors compensated for that! We also ordered the Roasted Chicken. The Roasted Chicken came with a watermelon, two eggs, hash browns, and asparagus.   Both chicken tasted basically the same except for the skin textures. I must say the fried chicken was the best even though it is a bit dry. The waffles were really good and it does not compare to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles back in Los Angeles! It's also quite cheap since it is $15.00 per plate on average!   This restaurant is one of the best OUTSIDE (and probably the BEST priced) in Las Vegas. Definitely a must try.   One note: The wait time is ridiculously LONG. If you go, you should go at around 3pm-4pm. That's when there is not that many people. We waited for about 40 minutes for our seat (and we ended up sitting at the bar area).  The food wait was about 30 minutes so expect at least an hour wait time of ... doing nothing.",

Using that as a guide, I came and ordered the chicken eggs benedict (a MVF favorite as the menu says) while my better half ordered vanilla waffles. She said that the waffles tasted normal (nothing new there). The eggs benedict were an arrangement of flavors that while not entirely unique, they were savory. It was definitely enough food for two people so if you're on a diet or need to be, you should share this meal with someone else. I washed this behemoth down with their strawberry kiwi lemonade. That was a real treat (no seconds on the lemonade though). So if you're in the Las Vegas, be sure to visit this place or their other location at the imperial palace. I recommend it!",

Now as you probably already know..the food portions are not for the weak or sorta hungry people...you better be friggin starving cause you have no business being in a place like this! If you share a meal they will charge you about $3 or $4 to split. A tip..if you're gonna order a side salad (btw anything \"side\" here is a full order of fatness) or a side of mashed potatoes or even just the biscuits, then they won't charge you the split fee. When we had breakfast, the nice waitress recommended I get the biscuits which were only $2.95 so that I didn't get charged that dumb fee. By the way, the biscuits are yummy and the fresh made jam of the day (we had peach but I got to try strawberry at dinner) just complimented that goodness. Ok on to breakfast...my boo ordered a spicy bloody maria to start..their version of a bloody mary but with an extra kick and I had a mojito...both were liquid delights and both gave us that nice buzz to prepare us for the Behemoth of Behemoths Chicken and Waffles!! It's a monster RRAAAAAHHHH!!...2 pieces of a breaded then fried chicken along side a stack of not 1, not 2, but 4 bacon stuffed (yep bacon stuffed) waffles. A steak knife is stabbed literally thru the middle of this Mount Fiji of wonder. The syrup is a sweet and yummy and the waffles are dee-lish. The chicken could be a tad less dry and they were a little bland but everything else on the plate was fatty already so I overlooked this. I guess we felt like we didn't get enough cholesterol running thru our arteries, so we headed back for dinner! Yay!  This time we shared the pork tenderloin with mashed potatoes. No need for sides so we just took the split charge fee. My daughter ordered the \"kids\" burger. Ok...the plate that held this Shamu of  a pork tenderloin  was literally about 2 feet wide! No jokes..this plate probably weighed almost 10 pounds!  The pork tenderloin was pounded thin, breaded and fried to a crispy goodness and laid atop a mound of bacon cheese mashed potatoes. There was some cool fried thin spaghetti pasta decorating on top of this that was actually edible......yeah go big or go home I say! My daughter's burger was definitely not kid size..no surprise here..and it was juicy and lovely. AHHHHHHHHHHH.....Hash house...my food memories of you will always haunt my dreams..I don't know if I consider you a good dream or a great nightmare. My hats off to you Imperial Palace..you just found yourself a \"Winner winner chicken dinner!\" kind of place :)",

I had the sage fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was perfect and the waffle was slightly above average and that is because it had bacon in it. Why didn't I think of that? Bacon in waffles.... genius! The sage in the chicken tasted great, some bites had more sage than others but that's how it goes. I also had a Smores mocha or latte and it was good. A little too big for one person to drink, I had to share it. So I really liked this drink because the marshmallows were toasted to perfection and the bitterness of the espresso mixed with the sweetness of the marsh mellows and chocolate syrup made my palate happy. I can't wait to go to the Hash House in San Diego, yummy. If you are in Vegas or San Diego, check this place out.  FYI- GO THERE HUNGRY, K",

    "text": "I was in town for the SHOT show, so a few of my business colleagues and I decided to try HHAGG after reading the stellar reviews it received.   That was my first mistake.   After ordering drinks, we waited approximately 10 minutes for them to  be delivered. Our waiter came by twice to apologize (which was nice), but stated the bartender was nowhere to be found, hence the wait.   After reading some great reviews, I decided to try the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. Having never had chicken and waffles, I was genuinely excited to try it.   After 45 minutes, 3 out of our 4 dishes arrive at the table. I was perplexed as to what took so long, since the restaurant was more than half empty. Eh no biggie, I had time to kill. 10 minutes later, the final dish showed up.   I started to dig in to my chicken and waffles, when it hit me: The chicken was fried on the outside, but still raw on the inside. I informed our waiter who again apologized, and he took it back to the kitchen. Fast forward another 20 minutes. An asian woman claiming to be the manager came by with my new order of chicken and waffles, didn't apologize, and simply said: \"Sometimes that happens\".   That right there turned me off of this place immediately. I told her I no longer wanted the dish, and to take it off the check.   My colleagues were already done eating, so we asked for our check.Surprise surprise, my raw chicken and waffles was still on there.   After getting that fixed, we left and I vowed never to return.

Located away from the hordes of the visitors milling about the strip, this place is so popular that there is usually a 45 minute to 60 minute wait just to get seated.   Thankfully there were several of us so many dishes were sampled.  I ended up with the chicken and waffles which were excellent.   The chicken was perfectly fried up, not soggy or greasy.  The waffles were stuffed with bacon of all things!  Genius!  I also got to sample the hand hammered pork cutlet covered in some type of sage cream gravy which was pretty fantastic.  The portions are ludicrous.  I felt like we were in an episode of the Flintstones.  Huge portions and reasonable prices.  Most entrees ran about $15 but the quality and portion size made it pretty reasonable.  Not to mention that most buffets on the strip are much pricier with hit or miss quality.  Seriously, those of you with normal sized appetites might consider splitting some of the larger entrees they are so huge.",

Menu can seem pricey at first, but after seeing the size of the portions and the quality of the food is actually a great value. The fried chicken benedict is their signature dish and is absolutely epic. It is $15, but more than enough food for 2. Also their flapjacks are $7.50, the size of a large pizza and can fill up 3 hungry roommates. This place is always packed and it is easy to see why.",

It's super busy most of the time and I hate waiting to eat at a restaurant that I'm not crazy about. Perhaps I haven't ordered the right item to make me feel this way yet, and that's why I'm not on the same page as everyone else.   The few times I had eaten here, the food was not horrible, just nothing really memorable (other than the size of the colossal dishes) to make me crave it. If portion over taste was what I was into, this place would be top of my list. But it's not.   The last time we ate here, I ordered the chicken and waffles which was very unimpressive. It was completely dry. I should've tried something else because I don't think anywhere in town beats DW Bistro's Jerk Chicken and Waffles, so maybe that was my mistake. The portion was of course too large, and it seemed like everything was just thrown on the plate. I didn't feel like the flavors complimented each other well at all. My Bloody Mary with the Bacon strip was ok. I don't know. This place just didn't do it for me during my last visit.  Maybe next time (if there is a next time) will be better.",

I love their fried chicken and waffles, their housemade biscuits are always a hit and the hashes have been solid.  Flapjacks, I highly recommend the banana and brown sugar one. It's a HUGE pancake that tastes like bananas foster! Downside is that the charge for split plates and have minimum order enforcements for people.

The line was extremely long and we waited a good 20 minutes for a table. Not a problem at all. We weren't in any rush. We were seated and the waiter came about 5 minutes after which was also fine. It gave us time to look over the menu which I wasn't impressed with. The menu was large, didn't offer anything to me that appealed to me. I ordered a vegetarian option since everything had with meat included pork which I do not eat. I must say, it would be nice to have turkey sausage or turkey bacon on the menu for those of us who doesn't eat pork. However, having a vegetarian breakfast wasn't a problem.   I order an egg scrambled with veggies and cheese added. It came with fresh fruit, potatoes and a humongous biscuit. This biscuit was bigger than my palm! Sadly, that was the highlight of the meal. The potatoes had no flavor and were kinda cold. You can tell that they were cooked in large quantity earlier in the day and served out of pot. The fruit was sweet so I didn't have any issue. My eggs and veggies again lacked flavor. I had to add a nice amount of salt and pepper to give it some kinda \"umph\". The food was just OK.   I was very disappointed with the food considering all of the hype including chefs like Rachel Ray. I have experienced MUCH better brunch/breakfast food.",

The music is loud, and harsh and abrasive. The decor is harsh; I get they're going for a certain look, but it's not very comfortable. The food is, well, harsh. The spices just a tad more than the tastebuds are comfortable with. It was weird. I wanted to say I liked my giant heaping portions of salmon eggs benedict with weird plastic cheese sauce, but I couldn't. They were too... harsh.

Another staff member saw I was struggling trying to eat and keep my child on the table she finally let us get a booth so I could sit her beside me. I go because I love their fried green tomatoes but when it comes to service don't expect much. It's always the hostess that ruins it I swear, but the waiters seem to fix the issues in the end which I am thankful for. Another time I came in and waited to be seated and the gentleman at the counter was having a personal phone call and drinking a beer. Waited a few minutes til he was done with his call and he then asked a lady who was clearly busy bringing people's food to their table to have us seated.

This place used to be packed, now it is a ghost town and for good reason,  the rolls are so dry and only a scent of honey glazed over them.  The Pot pie is not close to a pot pie.   It is the stuffing served outside of this hard, tasteless thing that looks and tastes like a hard hat.   A pie should be just that, something with a crust.   The stuff that usually goes inside and should be moist and have kind of a gravy was so starch and loaded with potatoes that it was tough to eat,   water would have been nice but the drinks did not get filled even once (with very few patrons)   this used to be a good spot, now there is zero attention paid to service or quality.  They try so hard to think outside of the box that the food seriously is as bland and tasteless as a box and now they give large portions that honestly nobody could possibly want to eat as leftovers.   Never again, never recommend it again.   My guess is that when they went from one to 8 stores in Vegas they gave up on offering a quality product or experience..... awful",

So I read reviews and pick Hash House A Go Go.   It was around 11 AM Saturday we went for brunch very busy about a 20 min wait. Not bad. This place was nice casual restaurant.   The food was Hash which are skillet fried potatoes and you pick what topping you want. I had the HH Famous Meatloaf, roasted red peppers, fresh spinach and smoked mozzarella not bad the meatloaf was not my favorite. The plates also came with 2 eggs, and a big biscuit. Very large portions did not eat it all.   My partner had Corned Beef, red onions and swiss cheese that was very good the corned beef was great. Also very large serving.   They are also big on waffle and chicken I saw that order being served a lot. It is a very large order so share that with 2 people.  This place has other locations in other cities I hope the come to Dallas area one day.",

Though my Vegas homie insisted on covering the tab, I felt that if a paying customer wants to customize their meal then why should that be an issue. Anyways, I got one of their uncustomizable scrambles which was just ok. I did like their epic hot chocolate. Pretty mediocre and again definitely overrated. I wouldn't come back because there are waaayyy better breakfast spots in Vegas.",

Could have done a better job .She would not acknowledge when we asked her for water and several times walked away leaving us wondering if she even heard us .Of course she would come back several minutes later with whatever we needed.However I still think acknowledging would've been nice.Maybe she was having an off day or something  .I would give her 3 stars. The rest of the staff are ... can we say ? AWESOME !!! friendly and helpful . Both funny and polite .The 2 girls and the guy in the front get \"Great Job guys \" from me  and \" keep it up \"  you are all an asset to this establishment .I highly recommend this place .

I liked not having to wait and the woman smiling at us. The menu is a little pricey but I must admit, the food portions were HUGE! The food is very fresh. While we waited for our order, they gave us a fresh biscuit to munch on. I snuck away from my boyfriend to ask someone if they could sing happy birthday to him, he said they didn't do that but he would see what he could do. My boyfriend and I both ended up unable to finish our food (which was VERY good by the way!) so we took it home. The man never came back to tell me what he could do or if there was anything he could so as far as singing happy birthday but that's okay. Very nice place with a home-y feel. I would come back, but only for special occasions :)",

    "text": "I've been here so many times and I was wondering to myself why I've never written about it yet. Guilty pleasure, embarrassment, I dunno.. What I do know this HH is style over substance. Huge massive portions that are impressive in looks but lame on flavor. I mean the food doesn't really taste that good. So why do I keep coming back  if I don't like the place? Easy, out of town visitors. They've all heard about the place with food bigger than you're head. I can't say I don't warn them that it's not very good but hey, what do I know?   What annoys me most about HH, the fried spaghetti and rosemary they stab and litter every plate with. I know its their signature but having to remove all the inedible bits from my plate is pretty lame. If it's not edible don't put it on the plate.   A few highlights from our last visit.  Traditional Buttermilk Flapjack - bigger than your head, thick, fluffy pancake. Nothing particularly special aside from the sheer size. We had this as a brunch appetizer and had a hard time finishing it.   The Kokomo - huge meatloaf sandwich that was on the dry side. To be fair I grew up on moms meatloaf and trust me seldom any live up to her sweet juicy meat slab. I think the chief problem with the Kokomo is that the bread to meat ratio is way off. To much bread.   Andy's sage fried chicken - very disappointing. The chicken while under seasoned was covered in a thick glaze of maple syrup reduction which just tasted weird to us. Unfortunately the reduction was also on the eggs and the bacon. I think if I were to order this again it would be with plain maple syrup on the side. That way I can control the sweet to savory ratio.  With all of that said of course Ill be coming back with out-of-towners. The look on their faces when the food comes out is so worth it.",

    "text": "This place has great food. I took my two girls for breakfast on Mother's Day. We got there right when they opened, so we didn't have to wait long...but it was quite busy by the time we left.   I ordered the chicken and asparagus hash. It was well seasoned and the potatoes and asparagus were perfectly tender. It comes with two eggs, made to order, a large biscuit and some fresh fruit. My oldest daughter ordered the grilled cheese, and my younger wanted the bacon waffles. Both were pleased, and I was happy that their prices were reasonable. No more than $5 for a kids meal (which were also generously portioned).   A few things threw me off a little. First, I ordered my kids a bowl of fresh berries and whipped cream (it was an extra $1 to have the cream whipped...). There were two strawberries but mostly melon and orange slices. If I had known it was fruit and not berries, I probably wouldn't have ordered since I know my kids don't like cantaloupe. Also, I saw a bunch of fun looking drinks getting served to all of the tables around us. No one ever offered us a drink menu and I had no idea that they had so many fun drink options. It would have been nice to enjoy the juice I ended up ordering BEFORE my meal. I also wouldn't have wasted money on an iced tea (which wasn't great. I'm a bit of a tea snob though). So if you're not offered a drink menu, be sure to ask for one. The fresh kiwi watermelon lemonade was delicious! It came served with a big slice of watermelon on the glass.   With the exception of my server, who wasn't rude but wasn't excited to be working, everyone was warm and pleasant. My girls had a good time tasting all of the fun food, and we will be back.",

No, he was definitely in zen mode and no brat was going to irritate him. You go dude. The drinks here are pretty good too.

We waited less than 10 mins for a table, which wasn't too bad. We order two hash plate thingys, both came out really quickly, which left me a little concerned. How did they cook our food that quick?! We were not given any utensil! We tried to get our waitresses attention, that took a few mins. After we finally got some utensils, we were both disappointed because both orders were cold. I'm pretty sure it was pulled out of the fridge and thrown into the microwave. The only thing hot was the egg. My friend ordered his egg over hard but when he got his order, the egg was almost completely raw, the egg white was still transparent. The waitstaff never came back to check on us. When they finally did, we told them that our food was cold and that the egg wasn't cooked.   In the end, they took one of the meals of our tab and apologized. The staff was friendly but could have been more attentive to their customers.",

The french toast was topped with candied pecans which the little one was really impressed with and then a half grilled banana.  What I really liked was that it wasn't covered in powdered sugar like most places are.  The other kid had the child tractor meal with a HUGE pancake, which she was barely able to eat about 1/5 of it.  She was like \"they expect kids to eat this whole thing?\" :)  Hubby had the delicious salmon benedict with a yummy sirihacha cream sauce which he already wants to recreate at home.  Everything was delicious and the entire menu was tempting.",

I had never had that before and have always been nervous to try it because I like to have milk when Im eating syrup yet in my mind milk and chicken just didn't go together but I decided to give it a whirl.  Oh my goodness.  It came out and was huge.  I don't even think I ate half and had to wrap it up to take it home.  The chicken was seasoned very well and the waffles were crunchy and fluffy.  AMAZING.  My dad ordered one of the stuffed burgers and loved it.  My grandma and her friend ordered some eggs and sausage and toast and said it was excellent.  I will definitely go back.",

Words like fun, different, and tall came to mind while eating through this meal.  One could easily share this meal with another person.  Service is very standard, nothing extraordinary but they definitely did the job.  Would I come back here on my next Vegas trip?

    "text": "I reserve my 5 star reviews for the most revered establishments, at which i have never had a care, worry or problem. That said, if i could, i would give Hash House a solid 4.5.   Like a lot of folks, i saw Hash House on Man V Food. I had the place logged in the back of my head so when i was at a conference in Vegas for a week and the boss says \"where we eatin'?\" i was ready with a home run.  Ive eaten once at the original off strip location and once at the new location inside the IP. For the original, we were seated quickly on a weeknight and service was prompt, but that's not wat you want to hear about, is it?  The food is fucking MASSIVE. That night we had 2 appetizers, the fried green tomatoes and something else that escapes me. Both were good but i was focused on getting what i had been waiting weeks to try; the sage fried chicken and waffles.  Alright, so, 2 MASSIVE fried chicken breasts stacked on top of 4 bacon waffles roughly the dimensions of 2 hotel room Gidions bibles cut in half and stacked, all held in place with a huge steak knife. The chicken was crisp and delicious with sage running throughout. The bacon in the waffles was amazing and was topped off with a maple reduction. By the time i was done forcing as much into my body as humanly possible, i still had a meal left over for the next day.  You would have thought we were in a photo studio with the ammout of flashes going off. Everyone in here takes pictures of the food, don't be shy, show everyone back home what theyre missing. HHAGG goes on your Vegas bucket list.",

We decided to order the roasted chicken hash. Like all of the other hashes it is tossed with crispy potatoes and topped with 2 eggs and is accompanied with 1 HUGE biscuit, but this hash has roasted chicken breast meat, garlic, onions asparagus and rosemary. It tasted so fresh and the chicken was moist and full of flavor. The biscuit was no afterthought either. Each table had what I think was a fresh strawberry rhubarb preserve to top your biscuit with.  Finally, we also ordered the over sized brown sugar banana flap jacks. These cakes were crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. I wish I had a picture but we were so hungry, it was too late, all the more reason for you to go see it for yourself.",

    "text": "Rewriting this, since someone asked me why I didn't like it. We went for my friend's birthday because he claims he's enjoyed this place before.  First off, I can't understand how this place has high ratings at all. The food is shitty, and the service is horrendous. When we walked in, the first place we were seated was right near the entrance where people can walk past you on two sides. I politely told the hostess that the table was unacceptable, and that we wanted to sit in a booth. She tries moving us two tables over so that we're right next to the busing station, and all the servers would be walking past us and guests on their way to the toilet. Apparently \"please seat us in a booth, we don't want people walking behind us while we're eating\" is something that's not understandable.   We had to then wait 10 minutes for them to clean an empty booth.  We sat down and hadn't even had a chance to look at the menus, when our obnoxious waiter came up and asked if we were ready to order. We told him we'd like some time to look at the menu, and would let him know when we were ready. Less than two minutes passed, and he returned and asked again for our order. We had to repeat this three times.  We were served cold biscuits with honey and butter. The biscuits were not light and fluffy, nor were they very tasty. We also had an ant in our bowl, which we found after we had been eating. When we told a passing server about it, she responded with \"Did you find it before or after you ate the biscuits?\" ... What? We found a LIVE INSECT IN OUR FOOD. What does it matter if it was \"before or after\"?   Everyone's plates came on obnoxiously sized serving dishes. My husband and I had ordered a kokomo sandwich, which came on dry assed texas toast, despite being called \"milk bread\". There were no sauces or anything to add flavor to it. The meatloaf, while tasty, is nothing I couldn't make better at home, and the sandwich was definitely NOT worth $13. My mashed potatoes came with, what looked like a sheet of cheese colored plastic on top of them. I couldn't even puncture it with a fork... The bacon was kinda glued to the cheese as well. My sandwich also came with a steak knife jammed into the middle of it, and a tree of rosemary. Not good presentation at all.  I ordered an arnold palmer to drink. I told a passing waitress (the ant woman) that it tasted off and was watered down. I honestly think the fresh brewed tea they had, was just a cup of water that had sat next to a teabag at some point. Very poor quality.  Our original server had gone from being hovering to neglectful. We didn't see him until after it was time to drop the check. We had told him at least four times that it was our friend's birthday, without any acknowledgment at all. Finally I said \"What kind of restaurant is this? Even fancy restaurants in vegas offer to do something for a guest's birthday.\". He told me that HHAGG doesn't, and offered to \"bring us a dessert\" but assured us that it would not be complimentary. We decided to just cut our losses and leave.   I will not ever return to this horrible restaurant. Seriously. Train your damned chefs. Teach them how to make proper food, and not just slop whatever they think is edible on a plate. Train your waitstaff and teach them to walk the fine line between being a hovering nuisance and neglectful... And do something for your damned guest's birthdays.  Oh, and hire some damned pest control, please.",

    "text": "My family and I went to dinner last night and it was a complete disappointment. First off, walking in there was no hostess to greet us. We saw maybe 4 front of house employees total. We ordered our drinks, mine a tangerine mimosa and someone else ordered a Bloody Mary. No bartender, so our server, who was very nice, went behind the bar to make our drinks. After looking at the menu I was so excited! So many delicious sounding items. It took me forever to decide. I went with the skillet chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Other plates ordered were the meatloaf sandwich and a sausage pot pie of some sort that was running as a special. We also ordered a cheeseburger from the kids menu. Our food arrived and everything looked phenomenal. Absolutely mouth watering to look at. The flavor, not so much. My chicken was doused in maple syrup, which wasn't listed on the menu description, the pot pie was terrible and the cheese in the meatloaf sandwich was burnt. The only tasty things were the kids burger and biscuits. That's it. I've never dined somewhere and had to send all 3 plates back. And when the manager came over, he didn't even know that the menu didn't list maple syrup under the description of the chicken!! He's a manager and doesn't know the menu?!?! That's scary. The whole experience was a huge disappointment and I have no plans to ever go back. 2 stars because the staff were all pretty attentive and nice. The manager needs a bit more product knowledge, but he was helpful and understanding. Maybe breakfast items might be better. Good luck!",

    "text": "This one kind of hurts, because in advance, I never thought this would only be three stars. Bummer. First off, the place does not suck. After seeing this place on Man v. Food and Bacon Paradise, I think maybe I just got a little too hyped up for it.   I know that part of the schtick is to be over the top...with the portions, with the bacon, everything over the top...I get it. But at a certain point, it's just kind of wasteful. I can't believe this is me saying that, but Hash House took me there.   The Sage Fried Chicken was delicious. I wish it weren't just breasts, though...moist, juicy thighs are where its at. I know what you're thinking, and cut it out. The tower of bacon waffles? Delicious, but why a tower? Who's gonna eat all these waffles? And don't get pissy when we need more syrup!   The Grilled Meatloaf Hash was pretty good. Lots of meatloaf, fried potatoes, and red and yellow peppers. Huge amount of this hash next to a little mound of two scrambled eggs. I really like my eggs, and I felt bad that they were so outnumbered. Three eggs and half as much hash would suit me fine.   The Bacon Bloody Mary. For the love of all that does not suck....I wanted to love it. I had so been looking forward to it. I don't know what the frig is going on in this world, but it seems to be a recent trend that everyone feels the need to make their Bloody Mary spicy as all hell. Hash House isn't just along for that ride, they bought the damned airline. IMO, Tabasco should *accent* the flavors in a Bloody, waking the whole thing up, leaving behind a slight spicy flavor that pleasantly lingers....it should not be a dominant, overwhelming aftertaste without the drink being ordered that way. Kind of like everything else here, it's just too over the top without needing to be so.   Service was just fine, although I didn't quite dig the practice of going ahead and adding 18 percent gratuity under the line \"large party\". Since it was just two of us, they were either insulting us by calling us large, or insulting us because we're cheapskates that used their gift certificate offer on restaurants dot com. Either way, unappreciated. I'm in the industry, and you have to really suck to not get 20 percent and have that rounded up to the next dollar....even more if you don't suck. You were great, but you're saying 18 percent. So 18 percent it is, then. Oh well.",

Ginormous portions, doting service, and a price tag that doesn't leave you wondering why you didn't just make eggs for yourself. Hash House eats places like Square One Diner for snackies.   The fried chicken dish here is BETTER than Bouchon's. There I said it! *dodges tomatoes* It has obviously been brined and dredged twice for a super crispy  crust and  moist and juicy interior. It's stacked on top of 3 waffles that are stuffed with bacon. I love that they drive a knife and stick of rosemary right through this tower of power... it says screw daintiness, I am some SERIOUS breakfast up in your grill. And the maple reduction and caramelized leeks on the side added more complexity of flavor that made this dish a journey for the taste buds.   The single flapjack was like the size of my entire torso. Jam packed with blueberries and bits of pecan and more than enough to share for 4. Also for good measure, I ordered a classic breakfast plate - 2 eggs over easy, toast, fruit, and potatoes. Thought I was disappointed by the size of the 2 eggs, this can be overlooked by the awesome crispiness of the potatoes. We also got a scrambled egg dish (with lox, brie, and green onion) that I did not like at all... but I tend to hate everyone else's scrambled eggs besides my mumsies'. Great value and wonderful flavor in a relaxed environment.",

The food at this location was great and each of us had enough leftovers to serve as a late night snack.  For whatever reason, the BLT Blood Mary here was far superior to any other of the BLT Blood Marys that I have had at other places.  Looking forward to going back!",

Sadly I always come here Sunday morning which is the worst time to go.  I end up waiting for an hour.  But that's okay, makes me hungrier for the food!  I get the corned beef hash and blueberry pancakes.  Sooo good.  They also have this homemade peach jam thing you can put on your fresh biscuits.  Their drinks are super good too, I wish I was there right now.. Sigh",

My significant other tried the chicken and waffles. It was sweet, salty and savory. It was a weird combination. The chicken on both plates were really good. The price was reasonable due to the huge portion. The service was great, our waiter was very attentive and friendly.",

    "text": "Ehhhh...I think my expecations were a bit too high.  My first time here after hearing and seeing so much about this place online and on the tube.  From Martha Stewart, Rachel Ray, to Adam Richmond, who all basically went cuckoo for cocoa puffs over this place.  For me, I think the appeal is more about the food shock when this enormous plate of food arrives at your table than it is about spectacular food.  Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good but I would truly want a smaller portion of excellent food than an over-the-top portion of O.K. food.  I ordered the Sage fried chicken benedict and Mark H ordered the Crab cake benedict.  Both came with the same sauce over the top which is a chipotle cream instead of a hollandaise.  It was pretty spicy (which our server mentioned) and went O.K. with the chicken but Mark H said it obliterated whatever subtle seafood flavors there were in the crab cake.  The proteins came atop a split country biscuit which was on top of a mound of griddled mashed potatoes.  Carb overkill and definitely why the plate is huger than it should be.  The plate also came with a small orange slice and a slice of melon.  I guess this small addition of fresh fruit is meant to counter-balance the super-rich carbo-loading dish?  Another thing I didn't understand was what seemed like uncooked (or maybe flash fried?) angel hair pasta sticking out the sides of the dish, almost like kitty or catfish whiskers, possibly added for texture but it was more like raw pasta chew that got stuck between the teeth. Very odd addition.  With all this being said, the plates could probably feed two seasoned eaters or a light eating family of four - including a small puppy. The majority of diners (including myself who has been referred to as a bottomless pit before) will take home food for later munching.  Two meals for the price of one is sort of a deal I guess but not really since my dish was $18.99 and was pretty much 2/3 biscuit and mashed potato.  One last thing I guess I'll mention was Mark H, who has been to the original one in San Diego, was a bit disappointed with this one because he said it now has that \"chain\" restaurant vibe, he said he felt like he was in a Chilis but with darker wood but better music...oh well.",

Not an \"I'm sorry for your bad experience\", nada, not even an acknowledgement!  My friend and I dined here on 11/16/18. I ordered the BBBLT and was very disappointed. I was specific to the server and asked for NO mayo as I am allergic. The food came, it looked good and had lots of fries. Luckily I looked inside the sandwich before taking a bite as it was slathered in mayo! I waited for the server to return and never saw her. (Service was very slow in an almost empty restaurant). I had to get up from the table in order to find someone to locate her. I told her I didn't want the cook taking a shortcut and just replacing the bread - the whole sandwich had to be redone. After waiting for what seemed forever (in this time frame my friend already finished her meal - how long does it take to toast bread and make bacon?), I get the new sandwich which now has 95% iceburg lettuce, 4 SMALL pieces of bacon (that IS NOT a BBBLT) and the majority of my fries were now gone! I guess I was being reprimanded for returning the sandwich. To charge $13.79 for an iceburg lettuce sandwich is ridiculous.  It would take some major convincing to return to this restaurant after this bad experience.",

Everything is huge at this place, so one dish can easily feed 2-4 people.   My only complaint is that the girl who seated us was rude and short with my boyfriend and I.

If you've read any previous reviews, you'll know that we tried to go to hhagg at the linq and never got to eat because of the atrocious service. I personally would have never tried it again but my brother in law suggested going here while we were in town and we obliged.  So, there was that experience as the underlay of this visit.  I upgraded the rating for this location because the service was very good this time. We were seated promptly, drinks were refilled, orders were correct, wait staff were very good. And, I'm pretty sure that the kitchen also prepared the food according to hhagg recipes.    My problem is, now that I actually tried the food, this type of food just isn't for me. It's too much bread and potato (I know, farm food...). The food is just rich and starchy with nothing there to cut through.  We ordered the chorizo scramble which was probably the best thing on the table. Potatoes (of course) covered in chorizo and jalapenos with a side od scrambled eggs and biscuit with a very hood strawberry jam. We also ordered the fried chicken Benedict- NOTE: no runny egg on the benedict???? It consisted of mashed potatoes topped with biscuits (why????) topped with one raw tomato round and some raw spinach, topped with scrambled eggse, then fried chicken the some kind of gravy and chipotle cream sauce. We also ordered the chicken fried steak which was unfortunately tasteless and served with more potatoes and biscuits (seeing a theme here?). Also, the chicken and waffles. Waffles are not crisp, at all, totally floppy waffles, then the chicken which was just there, nothing special, less seasoning then say a Popeyes restaurant.    Again, it's not for me. If biscuits topped with mashed potatoes sounds good to you, then I highly recommend this restaurant. I won't return.",

So I had to wait for someone to come back so I could get steak sauce ( needed that to make steak juicy) & butter and jam too. Guess they forgot to plate that... Steak is really thin and got over cooked. Wanted medium and got well.  So won't order that again. Hubby had crab bene and omg it was huge. He said it was good but we had to get a box. The best part of our meal was the two Bloody Mary's we had. Woo hoo!! So it was an expensive breaky at $84. BM did it... s'all I'm sayin'",

The line was enormous, the wait was more than  45 minutes (there was a team of 30 teenage cheer leaders ahead of us) and there were tons of people smoking. Yuck!! After a quick, impatient search we discovered that there was another Hash House in Las Vegas so we ditched the place and headed to the location on Sahara Drive.  We arrived to this spot, which is about 20 minutes off the strip, and there was no wait. Yay! The staff was courteous and the holiday decor was nice (we visited in December). The food however was average. I have been to the OG restaurant in San Diego and the food and overall experience at this Las Vegas spot was not the same.",

My family and I decided to show up for brunch on Sunday April 28, 2019 knowing there would be a wait since there was 10 of us. We signed in and was told there was a 40 min wait. We decided to wait. An hour later my boyfriend approached the hostess and asked how much longer and she said 30 min. I got impatient and approached the hostess stand 10 min later and asked how long was the wait, the hostess proceeded to tell me that there were waiting on one table to leave, ONE! The place is huge and they we're waiting on ONE table to leave?! Wow!  She said it was going to be another 40 to 45 min before they sat us and that the kitchen was backed up another 40 min so even after they sat us the wait was eminent. Her comment was... we weren't expecting so many people to come on a Sunday!  Really?! You weren't expecting people to show up on a SUNDAY?!! Wow! Communication with your costumers is a must. Having worked in the industry that is ideal for a restaurant. We had kids with us and not even water was offered to us. We ended up leaving and went to the BAGEL CAFE, smaller restaurant, also PACKED on Sundays and they accommodated us within 5 min of getting there.  Will never come to hash house a go go again. You can be an award winner because of your food but your service has left this family not wanting to come back. We will go to the bagel cafe anytime!  I hope a manager sees this and fixes the problem for the costumers who continue to go.",

The great thing about this place is that I can get my chicken and waffle fix while not being disappointed by the flavor. Presentation is consistent.  BUT, to my dismay, service was not. I've been to multiple different locations and although there has been a wait, when we get seated out server is usually friendly and accommodating- not here.  The server took our order and pretty much didn't talk to us at all besides that.  Then, that thing happens that bugs me beyond- inconsistent service.  I'm not sure what her prejudice was, maybe because we're from Hawaii or maybe because we're lesbians, but there was a straight Caucasian couple next to us that the server talked up a storm to.  We couldn't even get her attention to order another round of drinks.  I LOVE Hash House A Go Go, but I'll probably never make my way back to this location.",

Our portions were massive! My boyfriend got the corned beef hash paired with their famous Bloody Mary and I got the blue crab Benedict. The has was around $16. My meal was $18.99. The Bloody Mary was around $13. We both had to get to-go boxes. The food was delicious. The sauce they put on my eggs was spicy and very delicious. I can't remember if it was a hollandaise or not. It might have been a type.   I'm normally not a fan of Bloody Marys but their was delicious. The drink wasn't too tomato-ey. Their bacon was delicious. It was perfection. My boyfriend's corned beef hash was also really tender and juicy. I would definitely return. This was a great place for brunch. The parking lot was packed but we had no trouble finding parking.",

Then the burger that i ordered & was not asked how i wanted the meat cooked came out over cooked. Usually they ask temp of the meat, if not it's always a med cooked temp, this burger was WELL done. The bacon had nasty residue all over, usually from being cooked in old/dirty oil.   I work in the food & beverage industry, i'm not going to complain & send my food back to wait longer to eat & have my man's food completely cold. I took 4 bites & took it to go to give to my dog.

I was dying for a good bloody mary and this was not the place to get it. Yuck. 2 sips and I was done. They did get my request for extra olives right, tho.  Big big portions, as mentioned. He loved his Chx fried steak. I had steak and eggs and wonder if anyone around there is missing a pet. That slab of meat was no steak I could recognize. AND I ordered it rare and it came grey. Ugh.

    "text": "Slow... That is the take away I got from this visit. Having visited this location before I can safely say they have fallen down a notch or two. The first time I visited I was wowed by the speed and the awesome service! THIS visit was different than the first. We waited a short minute or 3 to be seated as there was no host present. While waiting patiently I started to wonder if we would get service... When server approach he asked for the Drink order. I ordered a Miller lite and after ordering drinks I went to restroom and came back to table and started a timer... having sensed that this could be a lengthy visit...not intentional but good grief here we go!!! Our server - he may have had tooooo many tables to serve. In my opinion/perspective some people can handle 4-5 table sections....others can't. Maybe it was scheduling or something...but I tooknote of at least 5 tables he was trying to service and 3 of the 5 had 5 or more at the tables. So I now know THAT my table is on the back burner... It took 12 minutes from time of order to inquire about the Miller Lite. He said it would be dropped off by bar staff. I said just cancel it. I was now dissatisfied... After finally getting the server to stop by again the order was placed. Everything was delivered by some person not our server...after food arrived our server waited until we were done to check on us and bring ticket. I guess that's how it goes. Potatoes on the plate were cold but by this time I was over the visit and didn't let the server know as I could only imagine how long a fresh order would have taken. The price was higher than most brunch places and I guess I just expected better than that. My first time certainly set the bar...I know we will not visit this location vs others that were closer to our casino hotel.  As far as taste of the food...the bacon waffle was a hit! The Basic was good minus the cold potatoes.  Rating is 2 star due to the bacon waffle! Respectfully, Bryan",

A few other places to better mankind.  The menu is full of mouthwatering delights and udder goodness, but I would say for a new comer to start out with their famous chicken and waffles. They don't skimp on this at all. From the tender juicy chicken, right to the bacon stuffed waffles. You will need to share this with a friend, unless your some huge wrestler or football player. Ask for extra syrup to dip the bacon in.",

Huge portions, great service, fair prices, awesome environment, fantastic food, I can't say enough good things about them.  Weather you live in Vegas, or visiting I highly recommend this place. Country Fried steak is delicious, ribs cooked to perfection, and world famous Chicken and waffles!",

    "text": "Date: 3/16/18 Arrived: 8:09pm Reservation: 8:30pm Seated: 8:58pm Server: Anna  Well, we made a reservation for 7 people for 8:30pm. We were celebrating a birthday. Arrived at 8:09pm and were told that our reservation was at 7;30pm and we had been marked as no shows. Luckily my husband who made the reservation, records all his calls so he played the recording for the host and they realized they had made a mistake. My husband approached the manager (actually the DM, Theron) at 8:36pm and was told we'd be seated in 2 minutes. He was very unapologetic and seemed to not care at all that there were 9 people including a wheelchair taking up all the space in the entryway as the inside waiting area was full. As we were waiting, another couple who had arrived prior to us were sitting, also waiting in the tiny now claustrophobic entry, but they got up and walked out. Now mind you there was an entire section of the restaurant that was  unoccupied but I guess it's possible they could've had a good reason for that. Like not enough servers maybe.  Sean, the host was very friendly and kept coming over to let us know that no tables were available yet. He also mentioned that they have a 20 minute policy, meaning that they have 20 minutes post reservation time to seat guests. We were finally seated at 8:58pm. 28 minutes past our reservation time. Our waitress was Anna and she was friendly, spunky, funny and fast. Definitely put us in a much better mood. Our food arrives pretty quick. We were all served by 9:30pm. I had been here once before and had the chicken and waffles but was not impressed by the flavor  so I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict this time and it was quite tasty. I really enjoyed it and only was able to finish 1/4 of it. The portion was HUGE! Baby girl had the vanilla waffle. She too only finished less than 1/4 of it but said she didn't really like it. Hubs got the portabella burger. The bun was way bigger than the mushroom so he felt like it was mostly bread. He was not impressed with that dish. My son is vegan and there wasn't anything on or off the menu for him other than a side of fruit per the server so he did not order anything but I kinda expected that so I wasn't swayed. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals though they didn't comment one way or the other. My FIL didn't finish his chicken and waffles which is so weird because he always finishes his meals and everyone else's lol. But I think it's because of the huge portions!  Our server did apologize for the long wait to be seated when she brought the check and pointed out that she didn't charge us for the drinks. (2 hot teas, 1 Pepsi & 1 iced tea.)  I'm giving them 2 stars. 1 for the friendliness of the host and server (Sean and Anna) and 1 for my meal.",

    "text": "We loved it! The staff, particularly Craig and Patrick, made the visit all the better with their outstanding service. The food was incredible with hefty portions and great taste. We've already said we'd be returning.  Not sure how to write another review about the same location so I will edit my stars and post about our visit the next morning.  When we arrived at 8, there was only one other couple in the restaurant. The hostess seated us; however, we didn't like our seat and asked to moved. And she did so without hesitation.  While sitting there, the hostess seated another couple that sat where we were at first. She proceeded to ask them what they wanted to drink. Mind you, she didn't ask us about beverages, nor had anyone else been to the table. We got her attention and asked why out drink order hadn't been taken. She said she wasn't aware that our waitress had yet to come to our table.  Meanwhile, another couple was seated across from us. We assumed the person who came to that table was our waitress because she left that table and went to take the order of the couple who came in right after us. We still didn't have drinks nor had our order been taken.  When Rachel/Raquel??? finally came to us, she had an attitude. A big one. So much so that we told her we weren't ready to order. She had no apology and gave off a vibe that literally turned our stomachs. As professional business women with employees, we were appalled and highly offended by her choice to be rude and nasty. And yes, I am going to put it out there that we are African-American, and, in this time of racial insensitivity, found her actions to be reprehensible.  The light for us came when we saw Craig passing by. I immediately went to the hostess and requested we be moved to his section. Our thanks to him for his kindness and patience that restored our faith in your establishment.  Initially, we gave our visit 5 stars but had to pull back. Our first time was a 5-star visit; however, the second was only a 2 star visit because of Rachel/Raquel.",

The corned beef hash and crab cake eggs Benedict were amazing as well.   Only 4 stars for service. I joked that the reason they give huge portions is they starve you first before bringing the food. Once the food came we did not see our server until we had to flag another server down to let them know we need boxes and the check.   Go for the food - it will not disappoint. The server issue may just be our particular server.",

    "text": "If you're a huge eater, then this is probably a good choice for you but on my second visit here I decided that it's just complete overkill with the portion sizes. One breakfast entree is MORE than enough for two people, yet if you want to share they charge you an additional fee. I find this a little ridiculous, but whatever.   The food is generally okay (I love a good biscuit, and that they can offer) but on this past visit I was not happy with my entree which was a smoked salmon benedict. It was basically a MOUNTAIN of heavy and dry components which did not mesh together well at all but most importantly, the salmon tasted really fishy. I'm a pescetarian so I know fish pretty well and there was something just not quite right with this salmon. So I take about two bites and stop. I had my husband taste it too just to be sure it wasn't in my head and he agreed. We are not complainers, but we felt they needed to know about the funky fish. Our server finally came by and noticed that I hadn't eaten much and asked if something was wrong, so we told her. She did ask if I wanted something else but I said I was okay.   A few minutes later a manager stopped by to find out what the issue was, so we explained it to her as well. So, here's where this establishment went ALL WRONG...this manager proceeds to explain to us the entire process of how they \"smoke\" their salmon. She said their method is a little unique and \"not for everyone\" and that she didn't really care for it either. Um, really? That's how you're going to handle this? She didn't offer anything to make it right. We weren't demanding a free meal, or even a refund. We didnt ask for anything different and just wanted to explain that there could have been a problem with old fish. The response was basically, our salmon is not for everyone, and sorry you didnt like it. Arrogant, and not the way to keep loyal clientele. In short, Poor management response has blacklisted this restaurant for me.",

I like taking friends from out of town here as it's a neat experience off the strip.  I don't recommend going to the other locations as they never really feel the same as the Sahara one.  Biscuits are amazing.  Portions are huge. Food is darn-right yummy!",

    "text": "Since my first review I've been back twice- once for breakfast and once for dinner. For breakfast my bf and I had a local coupon that was $10 a $25 purchase for breakfast, so first off that was a really good deal. We showed up on an early Monday afternoon and there were some people but it wasn't packed (thank God). Our server was great, checking up on us often and in a friendly manner. I ordered the Rosemary Chicken Hash (again) which was wonderful (again), and my bf ordered the Chicken and Waffles. The entire time he was eating he had the greatest look of pleasure on his face, very much a foodgasm.  For dinner our group of 4 showed up on a Monday night and the place was almost empty, perfect for us. I was very excited to try dinner at Hash House and was not disappointed. My bf had the Chicken and Waffles again as well as his sister, her bf had some sort of bowtie pasta (I can't remember the name but it looked good), and I had the Farmer's Pasta. HH certainly knows how to make innovative and delicious dishes. My dish had chicken over angel hair pasta with corn on the cob, potatoes, barley, and spinach, with all of this sitting in vegetable stock, and griddled parmesan cheese on top. The stock really made everything stay moist and it was delicious. I got full and had some leftovers.  Only negative about our dinner experience is that our server was in training and it showed. I asked for a Root Beer and got Dr. Pepper instead... kind of hard to fudge something like that up, isn't it? He also poured a can of Guinness into a glass as if he were pouring water, so it was all fizz for quite a while. IMO, all food servers should be required to know how to pour beers properly. Third strike was how inattentive he was; he did not check up on us and we had to flag him down to replace the incorrect soda as well as take a simple request for some pepper. I am glad these were minor infractions and did not ruin our meal nor experience. We did leave him a tip though that implied \"you need to work on some things.\"  Everyone loved their food and had leftovers to take. We also had a coupon that was $25 off a $50 dinner order. Not only is the food delicious and at reasonable prices, but they also offer great coupons in the mail. This is just the cherry on top for Hash House and we are certain to keep coming back.",

If you are a big eater, this place is for you. The meals are big enough for two people to share -if you can both decide on just one dish. That is where my wife and I have trouble, since I like spicy food and she doesn't.   I opted for the chorizo house hash with over-medium eggs. The food arrived in a large skillet filled with potatoes, chorizo, cheese, tomatoes, and onions. It also came with fruit on the side and a huge biscuit. I did my best to try and finish it, but failed. My coworker ordered the pork sandwich with fries (18 ounces of meat) - and barely put a dent in it.   The menu has a lot of different options that sound really good. I also got a chance to see their chicken and waffles dish--that looked amazing. Next time!  Our service was good. The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu, and kept our drinks filled.   Inside, it kind of has a warehouse feel to it. Therefore, it was pretty loud in the restaurant during lunch time. I am a fan of this place, and look forward to trying something different next time.",

If I happened to be in LV again and someone suggested going here, I'd happily say yes, but I'm not going to be dreaming of it or talking reverently about it like some of my friends.  I was very pleased at being able to get a table immediately on a Sunday at lunch time.  The menu, while not huge, had a lot of interesting possibilities (especially if you eat meat and/or eggs).  I decided on the apple cinnamon pancake - that's right, singular.  One pancake was the size of a serving platter.  It did have a good amount of cinnamon, and thin green apple slices cooked in all over it, which I liked better than the pie filling apples you sometimes get on top of apple pancakes.  My friend had the vegetarian hash; I only tried some of the potatoes and tomatoes, it was okay but not stunning.  Service was fine, price was reasonable.  The restroom was kinda cute in a way I can't explain.",

    "text": "If size mattered, Hash House A Go Go would score stars off the charts.  If service mattered, it would get three stars.  If flavor mattered... well, there would be a slight dilemma.   Let's start with first impressions.  Forget \"line was out the door,\" it was more like MOB surrounding the front patio.  Once inside, you're greeted with such a busy atmosphere (on a weekend, at least) - all the tables were seated, families and friends getting together for a breakfast-version of Thanksgiving.  If you haven't worked out those forearm muscles, not sure if this place would be for you.  Their plates are ginormous (yes, this word has been officially quantified due to the portion sizes at Hash House).    I would like to invest in whatever machinery they use to squeeze the orange juice.  \"Fresh\" is an understatement.  That cup of orange juice is so amazing - it's as if someone took an orange, magically stirred up the juices inside an orange (without disturbing the peel), gave me a straw and offered me heavenly orange juice.  I was mesmerized by the juice, as I watched the pulp inside the glass, sway back and forth, taunting me with its citrusy-goodness, waiting for me to finish the entire cup, and ask for seconds or thirds.  I resisted - for I waited patiently for the food.    It's hard to not turn heads every time a server came by with a plate.  Every plate looked like a mountain of food, with a twiggy-herb sticking up, followed by \"Holy gamoly, that plate is HUGE!\"  Pancakes looked like they were used as blankets to keep the plates from getting cold.  If it's True that you eat with your eyes first, you better close your eyes before the plates arrive at your table - you'd be full just by watching the plates make their way to the tables!   When the sage fried chicken and waffles showed up, I was amazed the table didn't tip over to one side.  The waffles piled against one another like mattresses, lending support the pieceS of fried chicken that sat so gallantly on top.  Once you cut into the waffles, bits of bacon are nestled inside the waffles, playing peek-a-boo, and tickles you with savory flavors to off-set the maple syrup, while making you yearn for the juicy fried chicken.  I'm telling you, it was all very well thought out.  Four out of five stars is fair.   Second attempt - featured menu item: Nappanee Hash.  Potatoes, tomatoes, strips of beef, eggs, (and other ingredients that I cannot remember) all glued together by Smoked Mozarella.  The potatoes were nicely crisped around the edges, eggs were made to order, and tomatoes danced around the combination, teasing with freshness.  Among the different flavor combinations came the strips of beef.  Problem - they were just that: BEEF.  If we did role call, the character \"flavor\" would be followed by silence, because it was completely absent.  \"Tenderness?\"  -- nice try.  That too, was absent.  Two out of five.    As busy as I've seen this place, I would think that they would want more servers/waiters to make sure that the tables are flipped as quickly as possible.  Service is a little bit on the slow side - and this is not just applied to the busy days.  On a day where there were no more than 6-tables, it took two or three attempts before we could get the waiter's attention to place an order.  Three out of five.    If you don't have much patience for long lines (on the weekends) or slower service, steer clear.  If you've got a big group of (hung-over) people looking for some not-so-fancy foods at big quantities and little price, you're in good hands at the Hash House.  If you're just tired of really watered down orange juices from the Poker tables at the Rio, just follow that holy-looking-glowing light to the Hash House A Go Go.",

I tackled their HH meatloaf hash - with roasted red peppers, fresh spinach, and smoked mozzarella.  It was a brekkie explosion in our booth.

Whenever I have people in town this place is on the to-do list. Be ready to share or for leftovers because the portions are Gi-normous. It's comfort food at it's best. They serve my absolute fav dish in this town, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Not your typical breakfast selection I know.  It's a piece of fried chicken on top of scrambled eggs and spinach on top of mashed potatoes and bacon on top of a huge biscuit cover with a chipotle cream sauce that is nothing short of heaven. The flapjack is the next on my list. Yeah that's singular. That's because it's pretty much the size of a medium pizza. The coffee is very strong which I like but I know I'm in the minority on that one.    The staff is very nice but you have to remember that great food takes time so if you are in a hurry you might want to try somewhere else. Expect about a 10 - 30 minute wait here on the weekends but you golden on the weekdays. For the weekend warriors why not try the Beer-In-a-Bag special they have while you wait. It's a Bud tall can in a brown paper bag. A Nevada Classic!",

    "text": "Best place in Vegas (maybe anywhere) for breakfast foods.  On our last trip, we went here all 3 days.  Given between hubby and I, we usually order only one dish per trip.  At the bar counter, they didn't charge a splitting fee ($2), but when we were seated there was either a fee, or it was waived if we ordered a side item (we got the $2 biscuit). The waiters were all friendly and tried to be attentive.  Sage Chicken Benedict - awesome presentation!  maybe cuz i love biscuits and gravy... it was one yummy mess.  Blueberry Pecan Pancake - huge, flavorful.  Thing is that the blueberries are only on top of the batter when they cooked it, instead of integrated throughout the pancake.  They didn't skimp on the pecans.  Chicken Pot Pie - once again amazing.  By open-faced, they creatively form this bowl from usual pie crust, and have the chicken & sauce overflowing out.  And it's huge!  One pound burger - Don't waste your $$ on this one.  They do 2 of these thin 1/2 pound patties that are dry and tasteless.  I barely touched this dish and helped eat my husband's pot pie.  Chicken & waffles - good quantity... comes with 3 waffles and huge piece of chicken.  Smores mocha - huge and really sweet.  It's creative, but share w/ one or two other ppl.  Watermelon/kiwi/lemonade - really pretty but a little pricey for what it is.",

My eyes widened and my jaw dropped when our server delivered these HUGE plates that covered almost every inch of space that we had on the table. I would be amazed if I saw someone that could finish all that food. My boyfriend is an eater and it looked like he didn't even touch his food! The food portions aren't the only things that are ginormous, their coffee cups look like bowls. I felt like the waitress should have said \"your bowl of coffee will be right out.\" No complaints here! That just added a cherry on top of this whole eating experience for me.   The food & the coffee were delicious! Next time, I would play it smart and share a meal & just order a side of pancakes (which you should know are the size of a PLATE).",

    "text": "This place is alright.  There was something about it when I walked in, where it overwhelmingly smelled of heavily delicious breakfast foods. I'm usually a big fan of chicken and waffles back at home so I found it fitting to order the Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles.  I definitely hate to compare to Roscoe's but HH takes a different approach. I was given 4 pieces of fluffy waffles and two chicken breast pieces for a really decent price too for what it was. I did enjoy my meal, but something about it made me really want the waffles to be thinner and just the use of heavy butter and grease for flavor. (oh yeah, and portions where huge!)  I understand that it was a NY Times favorite and that it was featured on Man vs. Food. It was probably a hit or miss deal ordering the chicken and waffles, but the rest of the items on the menu had looked really good as well.   Something really wants me to give this place a chance.  Chances of coming back? Possibly.",

As mentioned by almost everyone else, Hash House has HUGE portions.  I can't say that this is pro in my book but at the same time it isn't con.  I've had some very good meals there which would be worthy of 4 stars, but I've also had more than a few 2 star meals and it isn't always consistent with each dish.  A big part of why my friend likes it is likely because he orders the Cobb Salad every time, which is in fact very good.  For those who crave variety, the rest of the menu can be a real shot in the dark on quality and I've had some of almost everything.  The inconsistency makes it tough to form an opinion on specific dishes, and were I allowed I'd give this a 3.5 star rating, but 4 seems too forgiving.  Worth a try in my book, especially if you like Cobb Salads.",

Since there were a lot of people waiting in line, and a half hour wait. I figured I was at the right one. I ordered the chicken and waffles, chicken was tender and juicy but no taste. Waffle was thick and with the slab of bacon cooked inside of the waffle I thought I was in for a treat. But I was wrong. everything was soft no crunch in the food. not much taste either. Daughter had here usual burger and fries, which she did enjoy. Wife had bacon and eggs, which she also enjoyed. We also ordered a snicker pancake, the girls really enjoyed it. But overall, very much overrated. Huge portions, but I just didn't think their food had a lot of taste?",

For the price (most every item was around $12) you can definitely get better food and coffee anywhere else in the city (try Blueberry Hill for example).  The biscuits (a specialty) were big but they were served cold and without any butter or honey (is that a non-Southerner thing???).  Worst of all, the morning I was there (after 9am), there were 2 servers who couldn't handle a nearly empty room of 6 tables.  My idiot waiter (Jose or something like that) forgot about us and then when I tried to use a $10 gift certificate, ended up taking off only 10%!  Save your money and appetite and go for someplace that knows breakfast!",

The chicken was very moist and the chipotle sauce perfectly brought all of the flavors together.  I highly recommend this meal.  For the kids we ordered a pancake that was the size of a plate.  They were great.  They also served us up some biscuits that were drenching in a honey glaze that was delicious.  Had a great experience and I would highly recommend this restaurant.",

We came here for brunch, was around noon and the place was hopping.  Fortunately my friend's friend had arrived earlier to put our name on the wait list for a party of 8. I definitely recommend getting here early, or making a plan to wait for a table.  They close at 2:30 on Sundays and the place was still full when we left here close to 2.  Had been told the portions here were ginormous and that you should share..but when it comes to breakfast, I get serious.  When it comes to anything eggs benedict?  I get even seriouser...lol.  I had every intention of finishing this.  When the plate arrived, I was scared.  If you just look at the pictures you will see what I mean.  I ordered the original HH Benedict which was served on their homemade biscuit with spinach, bacon, griddled mashed potatoes (I opted for the crispy thinking I was going to get something more along the lines of hash browns,  but they were just red potatoes.  Were still good though) and covered in this chili cream sauce.  The presentation was beautiful.  And did I mention huge?  Oh yeah, I did.  Their specialty here seems to be the fried chicken benedict, which, by the way, comes with scrambled eggs also.  I just couldn't fathom eating all that but my tablemates who ordered it definitely enjoyed!  I also tasted someone's pancake.  So fluffy and yummy.  And huge.  The guy at the table behind us ordered some kind of burger and as soon as I saw it I knew...I have GOT to bring my husband here when we come to Vegas next time..not to mention anyone else I may be travelling with.  They had a large variety on their menu, was very hard to choose.  Lots of different fun coffee drinks and oh..the tangerine juice is so sweet and delicious.  This is a locals type place, but it is worth getting too for every inch off the beaten path that is located.",

While there I ate too much of a bacon, cheddar, and mashed potato (yes, mashed potatoes) 1/2 lb. burger.  It tasted good, but the experience was more a \"I can't believe I am doing this\" moment than anything else.  The fourth star from this review comes from one item alone, whose taste matched its size.  That item is the brown sugar and banana flapjack.  It was the biggest pancake I have ever seen in person, and it turns out also the best tasting.  The brown sugar crystallizes on one side to form a slightly crispy and sweet compliment to the banana.  Give it a try, but make sure someone in your party sticks to a breakfast item.  You can always bum a few bites off them if your dish isn't what you were hoping for.",

I was a Dealertainer at the Imperial Palace and we were asked to go to the Sahara location to promote them opening their new location at our casino.  The manager bought us breakfast after the photo shoot and I ordered my usual egg white omelette and saw all these amazing dishes go by our table.  I'm a foodie to the max and was very intrigued with these masterpieces being placed before other people...  I enjoyed my omelette but left feeling there was way more to experience..  Well as fate would have it, Hash House A Go Go was being featured on the food network that night when I went home.  They had this fried chicken/egg benedict  thing that I just HAD to try!  Well once they opened at the IP a bunch of us went in and did try it!  DEE to the LISH!!  BUT huge!!!  I'm an all day grazer so this baby would last me about a day...  If you like small portions, I suggest you split a dish with someone (although there is a fee for this), it might be worth it.

Literally I think everything has bacon in it--my waffles had bacon inside. My bloody mary was the best I've ever had, and the chicken and waffles were really tasty. They had fried crispy green onions which were a nice touch with the bacon, fried chicken, syrup and waffles. If you want to overdo it to go with your Vegas vacay this is the place",

Son had the Banana cinnamon French toast and the wife loved the chicken pot pie.  Portions are mega large and the price kind of reflects that.  All three of us took doggie bags home.

    "text": "I want to start out my restaurant reviews - with my #1 pick to eat at in the Las Vegas Valley. The would be the Hash House a Go Go. The Hash House is located at four locations in the Las Vegas Valley. The first is at 6800 West Sahara Blvd. just East of Rainbow Blvd. The second is in the Imperial Palace Hotel & Casino located at 3535 Las Vegas Blvd S. The third location is in the M Resort and Casino located at 12300 Las Vegas Blvd. S in Henderson. And the newest is at the Plaza Hotel and Casino at the end of Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas. They have a great menu for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Come dine for breakfast on a 'Roasted Chicken, garlic, onion, asparagus and Rosemary' Hash for only $12.95.  Or dine on one of their famous one pound burgers like the 'Apple Smoked Bacon and Mashed Potato' burger also for only $12.95. No need for side dishes with this one, even though it comes with a ton of fries. (Prices are subject to change) How about for dinner you try one of their 'Sage Fried Chicken Linguine'. All of their food is great to eat and easy on the wallet.  They say that they serve \"Twisted Farm Food\". I'm not sure if I would call it twisted, but it is some of the best I have had. Not only is the food some of the best, I have to say that the servers are some of the best as well. My beverage was never empty and when they asked if I needed something more I never felt as if I were being pressured. They truly wanted to help me. Even if they were just pretending, I could not see it. So, if you are looking for something unique and great tasting, get on down to one of the three locations of the Hash House a Go Go.",

The wait here was more tolerable, however, than the San Diego location which requires standing outside.  And, the wait was much shorter than when I went to the San Diego location -- 45 minutes v. 2 hours.    We ordered a variety of things at the table, including the the trucker combo, chicken & waffles, and a hash dish (chorizo & jalapeno).  Everyone was very happy with their meal, though most of us couldn't finish everything on the massive plates.  For the amount of food you get the prices aren't bad.  Couldn't stomach any more liquor so don't know if the drinks are any good but the Bloody Mary looked pretty damn good.",

    "text": "\"Hello, stomach? Did you mention that you were hungry? Oh, you did...? Alright, you asked for it.  Get ready to stretch those muscles because we're gonna test your endurance today...\"  Like many of my fellow Yelpers, I ventured towards Hash House a Go Go after seeing a Man v. Food episode.  This place does not disappoint!  3 people + 2 meals = full stomachs AND leftovers!!    We came in at 8:30 on a Friday morning .  We were promptly seated and attended to.  The menu is extensive, but we finally settled on two dishes and ordered.  We mentioned to the waitress that we had a tight schedule (a 10:00 spa appointment... I know, you're jealous...), and she noted that the service was quick!    Food came to the table and all of our eyes went big.  Yowzah.    Corned Beef House Hash - Corned Beef, red onions and swiss cheese tossed with crispy potatoes & topped w/ 2 eggs, served with fruit and biscuit :: The corned beef itself was just okay; I appreciated that they used strips of real corned beef, but the flavor and texture didn't really wow me.  On its own, nothing special, but combined with the other items on the dish and it was a winner.  The potatoes were perfectly cooked, and the biscuit was flaky and moist.  There was fresh jam on the table (score!); the flavor of the day was peach-mango.  Peach-mango jam on a biscuit... mmm... YUM.    The Tractor Driver Combo -  Two Eggs w/ bacon, sausage or potatoes with griddled french toast, which is dipped in banana cinnamon cream and served w/ pecan maple syrup :: Texas-style toast, moist and packed with flavor.  The syrup just brings the whole dish over the top!    The portions were HUGE.  We all ended up sharing our leftovers for breakfast the next morning and it was still more than enough. I'm interested in seeing the atmosphere in the evening and trying other dishes.  I already know that I want to try: Andy's Sage Fried Chicken w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit, Flapjacks (flavors include Blueberry Pecan, Blackberry Granola, Snickers, Mango Coconut, Strawberry Frosted Flake, to name a few!), and the Chicken and Waffles.  The service was okay; refills of coffee and water at the ready.    I'm sure it'll take me quite a few visits - and regular trips to my cardiologist! - to get the full Hash House experience. But, hey, go big or go home, right?!",

The service was good and our waiter checked on us multiple times, but the prices were a little high and the food was only so-do.  Maybe the weekday cooks are different from the Saturday/Sunday brunch ones?    We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken Salad, Hammered Pork Tenderloin, and Chicken Benedict upon the suggestion of the waiter.    Sage Fried Chicken Salad -  salad dressing tasted rancid and the chicken was dry.  Hammered Pork Tenderloin - moist pork but overly sweet sauce.    Chicken Benedict - moist chicken and good sauce.  Best of the bunch.    We should've dined elsewhere instead of wasting my friends' meal in Vegas at Hash House A Go Go.  I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon because there is better food to be had elsewhere.",

    "text": "Pretty damn delicious food, pretty terrible service.  First the good news...Food was excellent. Huge portions, so be prepared to doggy bag it, waste it, or share it.  Our party of 6 girls split the chicken and waffles, blackberry granola pancake, and chorizo hash.  The chicken was flavorful and crispy, and made up for the terrible fried chicken I had at the Wicked Spoon buffet the day before. The chorizo hash was cheesy, spicy, and yummy.  The granola pancakes were great as well.   Now the bad news...it took us about an hour just to get our food, and our waiter was a little too pushy on trying to make us order more food. We were fully prepared to just split two entrees, but he claimed we really needed three. When we asked if we could put in the order for the two entrees and think about the third, he flat out refused and said he'd come back. He asserted that because of the crowded restaurant, our order would throw off the course of the meal since everything is made to order (like every other damn restaurant).  We were considering getting a salad, which I highly doubt would throw off the delicate timing of the food. At any rate we wouldn't eat for a long while anyway. We did let ourselves be guilt-tripped into buying the pancakes, as we were hungry. It also took about 10 minutes to pay the bill.  I'd definitely go back with a big group to order some food, but I hope I wouldn't have the same experience of being pushed around.",

    "text": "I tend to go to Hash House as my go-to \"Oh god we're starving we just off the plane ehhh I don't know what I want, what do you want, I don't know, what do you want\" Frustration Ender when I've got Friends and Family visiting, and at that it excels.  They have beer if it's ridiculous family, and coffee if the hours are atrocious, and the menu's huge enough to please any crowd I've thrown at it. I've been about 7 times or so now, to both this location, as well as the one at the Plaza.   Pros: - You will never leave hungry. The portions are gargantuan. My father is very much the target demographic, a big, burly former farmer who likes his steak and potatoes measured in pounds, please. He's the only person I've ever seen casually finish a meal at HH. Just back from a early morning hike at Red Rocks and ready to eat a bear? Eat here. - The food's delicious. I've had the Chicken and Waffles a few times, the Chicken Pot Pie, some pancakes, and a few of the skillets, and have had nothing to complain about on any of them. The Chicken and Waffles are my favorite, because ooooohhh the skin on that chicken. Yum. - Mellow atmosphere, warm, friendly staff, and even when the place is super busy you never feel prodded or hurried to clear a table for the next person. You feel welcomed. I reaaaallly like that in a place like this, where you might be eating brunch for an hour.  - Great hours for a family that insists on getting up at the crack of freakin' dawn, and even when they are busy, they have a dedicated place for you to wait, not just a curb or a crowded entryway.  - Price is darn good for the food quality and quantity. A bottomless cup of coffee is about the same price here and at Egg Works; which means I'm not getting a fun surprise on my bill. That Chicken and Waffles is usually Lunch, Dinner, and lunch the next day for me. As long as you have a fridge at hand for your leftovers, Hash House is a great deal.   Cons: - You will never leave hungry. Holy balls there's a lot of food. If your mom raised you to clean your plate, or you are from Europe and have never heard of the Doggy Bag this place will give you pangs.  - You can definitely eat yourself sick. Be aware of your tummyfeelings. - Both locations are Popular, and they can get busy. And I mean really busy. Saturday morning around brunch time? Call ahead for wait times, and be ready for a wait around an hour if you get unlucky. This is not the place to come for fast food, or a quick nip in and out. Settle in, bring a newspaper for the wait, and enjoy that bottomless cup of coffee. If you come here with expectations for other than a leisurely meal, you made a mistake. - I can't imagine this place would be good for very large groups. Anything more than maybe 6-8 people, and I feel like you'd be waiting a while for food to come out and be fresh and hot, but I've honestly never tried it.",

    "text": "The name sure will grab your attention: Hash House a Go-Go. Doesn't that sound like it's a mess, a jumble, a hodgepodge, or chop-chops, or a dance of unlimited jiggering? Nevertheless, it's beckoning that my Mom and I frequented this place twice. It's got ample parking. A wait in line to be seated. Not a large restaurant but it has a small bar and dining room with silver metal decor. Relaxed atmosphere. Service is attentive. A second visit was with Mom again with friends and some other friends on an occasion during a Happy Hour for my birthday celebration followed by dinner. Plenty of hors d'ouevres passed around. Mom loved the shrimp in a stick because they were large shrimps, they were Prawns! Well of course, I couldn't be any happier but just munching on the many finger foods which to my delight had just the right amount of tastiness. Afraid to fill myself up in so much of the appetizers I had to stop from sampling any more to make room for dinner since I have heard from friends was to make room in tummy-tum-tum for the main meals. I heeded, for when our dinner was set on the table, we couldn't help but admire the presentation and the generous portions. One meal can be shared by two or three people. Not disappointing at all was the taste. Breakfast favorites are: Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict with maple reduction served with 2 eggs, bacon, mashed potatoes & biscuit which the smell of sage gives it the extra invitation to deliciousness, and the Griddled French Toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup was just the right amount of moistness and sweetness. By the way, the bread is Amish bread, oh goood. Anything that's Southern cooking to me is a favorite and those two are my breakfast favorites. Wouldn't say no to Chocolate Chip Flapjack with banana and pecans which the chef specially made. He specifically made it and personally served it to us. The chef was personable. The flapjack were thick, soft and goooey with melting chocolate just like ooheey-goooey cheese in a pizza. I like their lemonade and the sweetened iced tea beverages. Dinner favorites: Andy's Stuffed Burger is roasted Mid-West beef patties topped with smoked mozzarella & charred tomato, stacked high in large buns served with criss-cross fries. The right amount of \"seaside\" taste in the Manila Clams drenched in white wine garlic broth mixed with caramelized onions and sprinkling of crushed red pepper. Say, yummy clams. Never to say no but say yes to Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower which was served with fried leeks drizzled with hot maple reduction. The waffles were just the right crispiness, and the chicken moist. The Black Skillet Pork Ribs served pipin' hot in a black skillet pipin' hot were in its rib-y juiciness to the bites. So they say it's \"twisted farm food\", twisted enough to twist my tasteful memory of it as country food super-sized! A feast to the eyes. Get on it with your big big bites!",

Stopped by in the late morning, early afternoon and was able to get a seat right away, definitely made me happy because I expected a long wait, and the cherry on top was the cute little hostess that took us to our table, I don't remember her name, but I was madly in love (maybe foreshadowing the love I was soon to encounter with the food? possibly).  The menu does not do the culinary artwork of their entrees any justice. When the waiter came around to deliver our food, I felt like I was in a Dr. Seuss book, or was having a \"bad acid\" trip (and by \"bad\", I mean good). The artistic expression that they display in their food is something that you don't see everyday, or at least in a meal in which the bill won't total over $300 for two people. The food here, is breakfast food, or \"twisted farm food\" as they call it, and believe me, it will live up to the name. You will find stuff on their menu that isn't available at just any breakfast joint, some of which includes snickers flapjacks/pancakes (yes, you read that right! Snickers pancakes!!!) and something called the \"O'hare of the Dog\" a 24oz. tall can of Budweiser in a brown paper bag!!!, with a side of bacon.   I couldn't come to Hash House and not order the Man Vs. Food special, It was the fried chicken benedict. It came towered upon mashed potatoes, topped with a biscuit, fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, scrambled egg, and the chipotle sauce. And yes, it was as tasty and delicious as it sounds. One bite and the culmination of all the flavors will both blow your mind, as well as bewilder your taste buds, but in the best way possible. All the elements of the benedict are on point and good quality, the portions of their food are huge, it was ($14.95) for my benedict, and that could easily feed two people. As I watched the waiter frantically walk back and forth from table to table, I couldn't help but become hypnotized by the aroma and the visual creativity of the other dishes served here. Fried chicken and waffles looked and smelt really delicious, that will have to be for next time however.   Needless to say, Food won this battle. Food:1, Man:0, until we meet again Hash House A Go Go, UNTIL WE MEET AGAINNNN!!!!!!! (Shakes fist)",

My friend lives in Vegas so I asked her to take me to the Hash House that was off the strip. I ordered exactly what my friends cousin was drooling about.  Applewood Bacon and  Mashed Potato Stuffed Burger and a side of mac and cheese. Let me tell you when they set it down it looks delicious... it's HUGE.. and you feel like you get your moneys worth. AND THEN you bite into it. YUCK the meat was dry and there was no flavor whatsoever! I sprinkled some salt and pepper and EVEN ASKED FOR A SIDE OF RANCH. Anything to help me enjoy this meal the way I wanted too.   AGH! Such a sad disappointment. Maybe it was because I was super excited to go to a place that I felt only existed in my dreams?! Hyped it up so much that I made it taste bad? NO, it's just bad. DON'T GO.",

    "text": "So I was in Vegas this past weekend and my friend wanted to try out this place before heading out to OC. He saw this place from the show man vs food. I guess for what it's worth, I love american food and I love brunch.  The place is quiet far from the freeway (about 15 min local drive) and can be easily found from the street. The place has a rustic/barn feel from the outside. It was a bad idea to come during lunch time without any reservation (we had a party of 8) because the wait was about 1 hour.  The portion is ginormous!!! I ordered the Crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin w/ market yellow tomato, spinach, bar b' que cream and topped w/ scrambled eggs. The pork came out crispy and delicious. It's really a comfort food and it's highly recommended if you come with a big group. Don't try to eat everything alone because sharing is caring .... ^_^  This place redefine the word gluttony and I'd love to come back again to try out other food.",

I knew I wanted pancakes but with a pancake this size - I could only finish half. I had the blueberry pecan pancake - light and fluffy. The maple syrup was warm and it was a dream until I couldn't eat anymore. Then it became torture. I finished half the pancake along with the 2 scrambled eggs on the side and 2 sausages. I'm not having pancakes for a long while.   My hubby had the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. Let's just say it started out fast with the chicken going first. But by the end half the plate was still there - the biscuits sat there sad. Most of the eggs and potatoes were gone. It's just too much food for 1 person. I recommend sharing when ordering or maybe 1 appetizer and 1 entree. A fun place to be to see what everyone else orders. My eyes are bigger than my stomach.",

Corned beef is special cuz they hand pulled the beef and it's tender. The reason I said it was over rated is bec I was dissapointed with the taste. Although presentation is 'WOW', the taste is kinda bland. Chicken was tasteless and waffles are not that great either, too much flour and not as fluffy as I like it to be. Another hassle is that every person needs to order soething - even my 1 year old?? Are you kidding me?! Good thing we can order sides for additional person..... Kiwi Lemonade is just so so. The reason many people likes it was bec of the nice color it was presented - green/ yellow/ pink color! Again, I would rather go to other place for breakfast next time.",

Diego's customer service is better because the waitress/waiter will ask you if you need a refill or will look at your cup.  In Vegas, you need to ask them.  Diego has metered street parking.  Vegas has their own lot.  Diego has a shorter wait time.  Vegas has a longer wait time.  Inside, Diego has a smaller ambiance.  Vegas has a larger ambiance.  So, I guess in the end San Diego wins.",

Hash House is the place for people who just can't seem to get enough for breakfast, lunch, or any meal for that matter.  Monstrous portions is the name of the game.  The watermelon-kiwi drink seems to be the most popular, but I prefer the iced coffee drinks.    Prices at this joint are a little steep, but the portions more than make up for that!  You might want to try to come earlier in the morning, as to beat the mid morning crowd that seems to fill the lobby with an endless line for tables.  If you're not in the mood to pig out, bring a friend and split the plate.    All in all, you can't really go wrong at this place.  I'll be coming back for more.",

The atmosphere and waitress was pleasant and the food was very delicious. Next time we'd share an order since they're so big but this time we wanted to sample all we could. The wait time on food was a tad longer due to the fact everything is made fresh, no pre-made there but worth the tiny extra wait. We went to the one on Sahara, not sure about the ones located in the casino's. We'll recommend it to everyone and will be back the next time we're in Vegas.",

Portions are HUGE there.   I got the tractor driver with waffles and potatoes, playing it safe, just in case.  - Potatoes tasted fresh and didn't have any extra nonsense added to it.  - Eggs, they were nothing special, so plus for not messing it up, I guess.  - Waffles, one word, thick.   There is just so much to choose from. I do recommend the watermelon kiwi lemonade. Not only is it really really pretty when they first serve it, but it's also really good and quenches your thirst! Fresh watermelon too.   One thing I didn't like was the music was extremely loud and hard to carry a conversation without wanting to yell to the person right next to you   Come by here if you don't wanna stick around the strip!",

    "text": "I saw this featured on an episode of Man vs. Food. I saw the fried chicken eggs benedict and I HAD to have it. Ever since introducing my friend to this spot a year ago, we've made it a mission to trek over to this side of Las Vegas, off the strip where the auto dealerships are. The service is extremely friendly and attentive each of the two times we've gone here. We even took friends (who lived in this town!) to try this place out. I'm well aware of the new location inside the Imperial Palace, but for some reason, we didn't mind driving a little while (when we had access to a vehicle that is) to the original Las Vegas location.  The food is incredible and it'll satisfy every craving you have for rich, hearty, stick to your ribs, pimped out diner fare. Great for curing hangovers, especially after partying for two days straight between Club XS and Surrender. Sure, it's easy to just cook up a bunch of food, pour gravy or top it with cheese on a gigantic plate, and pass it off as \"value\". These folks make it an effort to have neck-breaking presentation with their plating. I typically order the fried chicken eggs benedict. I don't even know why I bothered ordering my eggs as egg whites as if it'll lessen the damage from the hollandaise sauce, mutant sized piece of fried chicken breast, and griddle fried cheese on top. Needless to say, the portions here are hilariously huge. Either bring a friend or come with a monster appetite. It's not exactly a place for petite eaters.  Last time I went was back in August, so this is a long overdue review for this place. I remembered getting a free specialty beverage of the day if I gave them my Twitter account and showed them on my phone that I tweeted about this place. I don't think I need to Tweet about this place to gush about how great the food and service is. I just already did. I'll shut up now....",

We ordered two dishes, salmon benedict and corn beef.  I think it is a crime if benedict's egg white is very thin and yolk is not runny - and, that was how the benedict was made here. Hollandaise sauce was way too cheesy and thick. Mashed potatoes at the bottom was cold. I couldn't even finish a quarter of the portion because it was really not enjoyable. Corn beef was cheesy as well. The browned potatoes were good though. English muffin was way too dense. This location did not fully display the farm to table culture and was definitely not on par with the original location in SD. If I had taken the warning from the SD peeps that this location was a franchise and different from the SD one I wouldn't have to have two brunches in a day. No wonder this location did not have a line and an hour long wait. But franchise or not, HH should make sure the food quality is consistent throughout different locations so you don't get bad reps and damage the brand!",

The portion size would put Claim Jumper to shame. (Side note, I wonder if they bought all of Claim Jumpers plate inventory when they BK'd...?) So the low down on the mile high plates? We ordered from several section on the menu.  From the Hash section Miles went with the roasted chicken Hash  and brein went with the Meatloaf Hash (Shocker?) Bill went for the Indiana Favorites section and got Sage Fried Chicken with eggs.  Kerie and I thought eggs Benedict sounded good (and possibly a smaller choice...just by looking at the plates being delivered to other tables...we were very wrong). She got the Crispy Hammered Pork Benedict  And I the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Starting from the bottom mine had 2 huge home made biscuits, about 2 cups of mashed potatoes (Crisped on the griddle), fresh spinach and tomato slices, 2 slices of crispy bacon, about 8 oz of melted mozzarella cheese, scrambled eggs (looked like 2 or 3), and then the largest fried chicken breast I've ever seen with chipotle Creme poured on top. Oh yea, a slice of watermelon was in there somewhere too.   Everyone enjoyed their meal, Brein and I enjoyed taking 80% of the food home with us and I even took my dad there a few days later. All in all this is a must HOWEVER I will say that a friend got sick from the location at Imperial Palace and this review ONLY vouches for the location on Sahara.",

Party of 4 on a Saturday (late) morning.  We waited less than 30 minutes for a seat.  The patio area was refreshing and sunny.  Our waitress was helpful with recommendations and any questions that we had.    Our drinks came first.  I had the mint latte, which had a splash of mint.  It tasted really good with the actual mint leaf.   When the actual food came out, our table went absolutely silent.  GIGANTIC PORTIONS.  And so pretty (I'll post pictures).  I tried to put a fork or knife in the pictures for porportion, but the flatware is on the large-side, too!  I had the smoked salmon benedict.  The dish was a little overwhelmingly salmon-y, but I liked the combination of the other ingredients.  My bf had the Banana Walnut French Toast.  The toast was a least an inch thick and surprisingly filling for how fluffy the texture was.  The other couple with us had the quesadilla and the bacon burger.  I had a bite of the burger and it was one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had.  The quesadilla was mild.  The prices are on the high side for a breakfast place, but I don't think you can even compare, since the servings are so big.    I did try to use a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon, but I didn't read that the stupid thing said \"dinner only\".  Waitress wouldn't take it, but it sounds like if it wasn't a weekend morning, she might have.    Either way, I enjoyed myself and I will be back.",

We ended up leaving because some of our other friends wanted to join us but figured it would be too much to ask to accommodate a group of 13 after business hours so we decided to leave after all.  On Saturday we decided to revisit for brunch.  We had a group of 6 and waited for approximately 20 minutes for a table.  We received our order within 15-20 minutes after ordering and the place was pretty packed.  After receiving our order the Manager, Lupe approached our table and asked if we were the same group that came late Thursday evening and left, I was very surprised she remembered us.  She thanked us for coming back and glad we decided to revisit.  She brought over a huge plate of the famous waffles with bacon inside on the house.  Very nice gesture.   Everything we ordered was amazingly DELICIOUS!!!! Since being back home in San Francisco, that's all my husband brags about.  The portions are HUGE!  My family and I can't wait to revisit Vegas so that we can stop by and see Lupe and team.  I can't remember our waitress's name but he was vey knowledgeable and awesome!!! Thanks Hash House for the great experience!!! Lupe you ROCK!!!!",

    "text": "People aren't kidding when they talk about the portion sizes.   Hash House A Go Go, you are just fascinating!  We came here on a Wednesday morning for breakfast. The wait wasn't too bad. It took about ten minutes for them to give us a table for two.   We enter the restaurant. Hrm, it was a bit loud. My girlfriend and I could not take our eyes off the plates being served as we walked in. Patrons around us were gorging on gargantuan plates, while a few packed lots of leftovers into to-go boxes. We decided to share a plate.  We ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. We got the option with a biscuit, two pieces of chicken, two eggs, two slices of bacon, and mashed potatoes. The food didn't take too long to come out. But it would have been worth the wait. The dish looked divine!  There was a huge rosemary stem sticking out of the mashed potatoes. The scent was deliciously fragrant. The chicken was seasoned very well. It was a bit sweet! My stomach is craving for more as I write this :[ ahh. The biscuit was good, and the mashed potatoes.. oh myy, there was just so much. Even though we shared the dish, we could not finish it. We were too full. Oi.  Be warned that it's no joke when people say that the plates are huge. Be mindful of your order and don't let your eyes deceive you. Your stomach will hate you for it when you're wolfing down the rest of your meal.   Hash House is a win for me.",

    "text": "Very busy here even though it's off the Las Vegas strip.  We came here one weekend to check this place out and this place did not disappoint.  The wait was long (~40 mins), but worth it.    I got Andy's Sage Fried Chicken which came with mashed potatoes, bacon, spinach, mozzarella, and scrambled eggs with biscuit.  This entree is so big that they stabbed a steak knife in the middle of it!  My first bite of this monstrous entree was filled with the juicy taste of the chicken, coupled with the semi creamy texture of the mashed potatoes.  The bacon and the biscuit gave it that breakfast flair.  They sprinkled some spicy sauce around the plate and it added the right punch to the dish.  We also got the pancakes and waffles.  These were your typical pancakes and waffles, albeit in a larger serving size.  Overall, you will be FULL after dining here.  For some, it's a great way to start a day.  For others, it's a great way to end a long night in Vegas.",

It was a Friday around 11am so the restaurant was mostly full.  Even though the food was amazing (as usual) me and my friend visiting were mostly ignored.  We waited about 15 minutes to order and about 20 minutes to get our check, and another 10 to pay.  It wouldn't have been so bad but the waiter visited other tables in the area several times before coming to us.  With that being said, the food was great.  I always enjoy the food at Hash House a GoGo.  But I would not go back to this location because I have never had a problem at any other location.",

Also, service is not that attentive or pleasant for that matter. Maybe if the wait staff spent as much time tending to diners as they do socializing with each other business might be better.",

    "text": "Yes...this place is located in the Imperial Palace, which I think we can all agree is a giant petri dish of cigarette smoke and whiskey stains.  But, you can rest assured that Hash House is worth wading through the musty, humid, depressing I-Palace.  I have seen a few reviews that say you may wait in line before you can get a table at this place, but my husband and I did not have that issue.  We went during the late afternoon/early evening and got right in.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive.  After placing your order you receive a complimentary order of home made biscuits....did you catch that?  Let me say that again...  After placing your order you receive a COMPLIMENTARY ORDER of HOME MADE BISCUITS!!  I was like Whaaat?!?!  :D  Trust me, they melt in your mouth!  I highly recommend ordering the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  That was literally the best fried chicken, and the best waffles I have ever eaten.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The chicken is just the right texture of brown and crispy.  The waffles were cooked long enough to where you had that ever so slight \"crunch\" when you bit into them, but the insides were warm and soft.    I should also mention that the waffles had ribbons of crispy bacon baked right into them!  I am not talking about the semi-cooked soggy bacon that most places sling on your plate in a lazy stupor.  (You know what I am talking about...the kind where you KNOW it's not cooked all the way).  That bacon CRUNCHES when you bite into your waffle!  Hands down this place is wonderful.  I literally dragged my husband through the sick, sad casino to get a load of this place.  It was well worth it.  This place is likely rocking around 2am-6am when people are just leaving the bars, so if you go late at night, be prepared to wait.  If you go during the daytime, you will likely have better luck.  Regardless of what time you decide to go, make sure you stop by this place, you will NOT regret it!  The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5?  You guessed it.  It's in the Imperial Palace.",

We had the meatloaf sandwich with mac & cheese, deep fried pork burger with sweet potato fries, fried chicken & waffles, and big ol chicken pot pie. The food is good definitely worth trying out if you're in vegas. We all had to get to go boxes because none of use finished our meal.

For example, I don't always want half a plate of potatoes with my breakfast but if you ask for fruit instead, even for an up charge, they won't change it.  They'll give you less food for the same price, but for an additional cost they still won't alter the dish.  Same with lunch and dinner.  It drives me crazy.  My husband and I still take out of town guests here and we think the food is very flavorful and well made, but we rarely go on our own anymore because as much as I can appreciate potatoes (originally a midwestern girl) every dinner and breakfast doesn't need 2-3 pounds of them fried or mashed to make a complete meal.",

I've come close, but with a drink and everything. It's still a goal awaiting to be accomplished.  My friend always gets the fried chicken- which I PERSONALLY think it's a little on the dry side. But then I was never really a fried chicken fan. I only like really super juicy fatty fried chicken (i.e-Church's) ; my friend loves it though- and apparently most people on yelp do, too.  I have tried their flapjacks-delicious! Most recently tried their Corned-beef hash. Also delish. SO JUICY. Came with a biscuit, two eggs and a slice of cantaloupe and orange. Everything was cooked to perfection, and the presentation of the food itself just makes you wanna .. ah, EAT.  I also tried the banana mocha? It was okay. The top part with all the whipped cream and stuff was great. But as you proceed, the drink just starts to taste pretty much like a \"standard\" mocha.  Ok, I simple HAVE to put this here, we found a piece of plastic in our food.  ;x Which really disappointed me as I've been a big fan of this place. We told them about it and they quickly apologized. Their manager (?) also came over to say sorry. They took that off our bill, but honestly- if i owned this place and that happened to my customers, I would've waived their entire bill. I'm just sayin'.  And I gotta be honest, it kinda worries me, how the hell did that get in my food? Where was it from anyway?  Well- will probably come back but if there's a strike two, it's gonna be out forever.  DO EXPECT: Nice service A 30-45 min wait on a Sunday morning- but they do give you a buzzer so you can go to your car and take a nap lol Good food",

And exactly like what I saw on TV, the portions were huge!!!  The place does not have \"portion control\" in their vocabulary! Everything was the size of my head or possibly larger!    Hash House A Go Go serves a lot of breakfast and comfort foods that can definitely satisfy a big appetite.  In fact, I tend to eat huge portions and had met my match that day.  I ordered the Meatloaf Hash, while my bf attempted the Fried Chicken Benedict that Adam had taken on.  It was good and very satisfying on the tummy, but after eating 1/3-1/2 into our dishes, we were couldn't eat anymore!  I highly recommend sharing food with a friend because me and my bf were left with about a pound or two of leftovers.",

It had a huge piece of chicken, with mash potatoes, bacon, this amazing chipotle sauce and eggs it was on a a biscuit, no lie, the size of my head.   This place was delicious. It took me breakfast, dinner and breakfast again to eat the greater of it, I didn't finish it at all, but close enough.   Their banana pancake was prob 15\" around. It was so yummy!",

We tried the location on Sahara, were excited to see the watermelon drinks, colorful, looked great and couldnt wait.  $$$ this place is expense for what you get and not very tasty either.  I was excited about chicken and waffles they looked so good. My husband ordered the hamburger, and it was horrible.  So, So disappointed!  Oh yeah and the waiter we had was horrible, drinks were empty never offer a refill, and the food took over an hour to prepare.....  When I advised the manager of the issues, she comped our iced tea... The bill for 2 was over 43.00!  For lunch that is a little much.",

    "text": "Was kinda disappointed, but will give it another try. The wife and I went late on a Saturday for dinner. We walked in and the place was empty at 915pm. Okay it was closing in 45 minutes, but was very surprised. We were seriously the only ones in there, maybe it's more of a breakfast place. We were greeted by the hostess who was very sweet and pleasant. She showed us to the table and made some recommendations since I had announced it was our first time there.  I knew the portions were going to be huge so no appetizers for us. We looked at the menu briefly since we kinda knew from the website menu what we wanted. I ordered the chicken and bacon waffle tower, the wife had the chik pot pie. Both were huge. The potpie comes in what looks like a crust hat. The chikn waffles is built like a tower. The presentation was vey good, but the food in my opinion didn't live up to the hype. The fried chicken was somewhat dry, bland and greasy with a slight sage taste. The waffles on the other hnd were the best part... The bacon inside were crisp. I really didn't like the mound of fried leeks that everything was plated on. I think that's sort of what turned me off to the whole meal. I mean you have the sweet and savory combination of waffles, maple syrup and fried chicken, and then get hit with a bit of onion taste... Very off putting.  The potpie was different than usual which is fine. I can't really comment on the taste but it was made with real nice chicken pieces and huge chopped veggies and potatoes. The wife liked it but stated not to expect the typical c.p.p.  Bad news... The dessert. We had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> coupon to use so we needed to hit $50 on the tab. We ordered a snickers bread pudding. It comes out with ice cream on top which didn't taste like ice cream, but more like ice milk. It was not velvety smooth and silky but weird. I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be ice cream she said yes... Okay. Then we get into the bread pudding... It wasn't bread pudding at all. It was chocolate cake dipped in some egg wash maybe and I don't know...cooked somehow... I think it was microwaved because I hit a nice frozen section on the bottom. I asked the waitress if it was frozen, she said yes. She then looked at me blankly... I looked at her blankly. My wife said its okay we can't finish it anyways.  I will, call me crazy give it another shot for breakfast, maybe try the Benedict. Again just to be clear... I believe it is way overhyped so if u go, use a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon, and don't expect great food. The waffles were decent and my wife liked the potpie.",

Service was spotty; we felt forgotten the first 10 minutes, then it picks up when we ordered and received food, then drops again when empty glasses stayed empty for 30 plus minutes.  When food arrived, I was in a different world. I felt like Gulliver visiting Brobdingnag. I felt like I was at Paul Bunyan's favorite diner. Portions are gigantic! Just one order of each appetizer and main course feeds two.  The Baby Back Ribs was slathered with BBQ sauce and tasted like it was slow-roasted the entire day. The delicate meat fell of the bone when disturbed. It's very lovely. Garlic Mashed Potatoes has a chunky texture and is garlicky, and that's not a bad thing. It's a shame, we didn't have stomachs like Bunyan to have room for dessert.  Despite flawed first impressions, there was genuine satisfaction the hearty homemade culinary had delivered. And I would come back.",

    "text": "Brenda's daughter took us here for breakfast one Saturday morning instead of going to the local Denny's or IHOP. She insisted that it had some good food and the overall reviews said it was pretty good. When we got there, there were quite a few people ahead of us so hopefully that spoke to the quality of the food--unfortunately it didn't. After a long wait in line we finally were seated and greeted by a waitress who didn't seem like she really wanted to be there either (she probably already tasted the food).  We ordered our coffee and juice and stared at the menu. Brenda and I both have an adventurous palate and are willing to try anything at least once. However, there is a difference between adventurous and just plain crazy. When you read the menu, nothing jumps out and says \"Hey! Pick me! I'm really tasty.\" Quite the opposite--the food and flavor combinations of everything except the pancakes don't even begin to sound like they'll work together. However, to be polite, we placed our orders and waited for the food. I had the only thing that sounded somewhat normal to me; the corned beef has with red onions and Swiss cheese. By the way, they have a no substitutions policy and they do enforce it.  The service here isn't any better than the food. Wait staff is slow and you may or may not have everyone's meal served at the same time.As we waited for the food to arrive, we saw that the portions they brought out were huge--even bigger than what we get at Black Bear. Unsurprisingly, with the amount of people here, the wait for the food was about 40 minutes, which is a bit long for breakfast. Apparently because the food is all \"homemade\", it prevents the kitchen staff from having any type of timing system to ensure everyone at the table is served at the same time. When my food was placed in front of me, I just kind of stared at it. It certainly wasn't what I was expecting when I ordered corned beef hash. Instead of a neat presentation, I faced a huge pile of potatoes and the hash topped with a slice of cheese and two overcooked eggs. Sticking out of the top of this monstrosity was a rosemary tree. Normally, I would expect something like this to have the hash grilled and then have the cheese placed on top and remixed once it the cheese melted before putting it on the plate. I also expected the \"crispy\" potatoes to be on the side. Since they were thrown in with the hash, they were soggy from all the grease.  The food itself lacked any real flavor and no amount of salt and pepper really did anything to improve it. Sure, the portions were huge, but that just meant more wasted food at the end of the meal. Quality is a bit more important that quantity.  Their motto is \"Twisted Farm Food.\" I'm not sure what farms they're visiting, but it doesn't conjure up any memories of food I ate growing up in Pennsylvania Dutch country. Head on over to IHOP, Denny's or Black Bear if you want a better meal at a cheaper price.",

With that being said, every time I am in Vegas for work, I meet here with a good friend. Not always because it's cheap and fast, not because it's new to me, but just for the pure satisfaction and masochism. Yes, it's satisfying to order something huge and usually very good, but also very disturbing (because of the gigantic size). And for me, it works as a great diet plan because you don't want to look like the 5 400lbs plus people in the booth next to you. Anyway, short story long, go here. Try it. If you really don't like it, which probably won't be the case, give it to a homeless person of your choice, they are on every street corner in Vegas and would very much appreciate it.",

The chicken was delicious and crispy and not at all dry. Combined with the hot syrup it was yummy!  The bf had the fried chicken benedict which was also huge. The chipotle sauce drizzled on top gave it a nice little kick.  We thought we were going to some hole in the wall breakfast joint but turned out to be pretty nice. They had a whole menu specifically for their unique drinks in addition to their regular menu and a separate menu for specials of the day. My chicken and waffles were $18.95 but it's great bang for your buck if you wanna try it on a Friday when it's a special price of $12.95. Good price for lots of food.",

    "text": "so good.  it was a $20 cab ride from the strip but hash house a go go had a good menu and everything we ordered was really tasty so it was absolutely worth the effort.  we had to wait 15 minutes for a table but when we left around 1, there were a whole bunch of people waiting so i'm glad we were able to get there by noon.  i got the fried chicken benedict since if fried chicken is on the menu, i am almost sure to get it.  it was a biscuit sitting on a mound of mash potatoes with egg, a well spiced fried chicken breast, bacon, tomato, spinach and a red pepper cream sauce.  it was a ridiculous amount of food and i'm suprised i didn't go into cardiac arrest just looking at it.   i understand what another reviewer said about their food looking too messy because when my benedict came out, i was overwhelmed thinking about how i was going to eat it.  usually, when i get a giant plate of something, it makes me kind of sick but because it was so delicious, i got over it.  i couldn't even finish half.   my beverage of choice was the bloody mary.  it was tangy and spicy with a lot of stuff in it, just how i like it.  i didn't think it had much alcohol but as i got progressively more giggly during the meal, i realized i was wrong.  my friends got the  blueberry pancake (it seriously is the size of a big pizza), the meatloaf hash and the veggie hash and they all really liked their food but the best thing we had may have been the strawberry jam.  none of us are into big chunks of bread and had not touched our biscuits but once we decided to try some of the jam, we basically empied the container onto them and had to have them for later.   it was not too sweet and had a really good consistency.   now, i'm sad i didn't end up eating the leftovers because we were too busy drinking and gambling.  i would definitely recommend it if you want good, non-buffet food.",

Its contemporary decor is no match for the Imperial Palace's notorious 60s \"Enter the Dragon\" appeal. I think we've passed Bruce Lee's era on Mr. Han's island.   It was a maze trying to find this place. Had to ask around, walk up and down the casino floor to find the escalator to take you to the restaurant. *whew* A workout it was. We were greeted by a friendly host and then given the menu.   A neighboring guests overheard us wanting to order two entrees, but she showed us her platter of food (a steak and potato entree) that was HUGE and strongly suggested us to share an entree. So, we took her advice and ordered ONE platter of BBQ Ribs, which came with steamed vegetables and mashed potaotes. For an appetizer, we tried the House Hash Salad. Good stuff.   The ribs were deeelish and somewhat messy. But pretty flavorful. Satifying meal and we had to wheel ourselves outta there!  I would come back.   The Negs: 1) service is SLOW here; 2) no for-warning from the wait staff that the portions were HUGE. Thanks to the guest who told us. 3) Hard to find restaurant.",

Hash House is kind of known for enormous portions and this was no exception.   I had the iconic chicken & waffles: they didn't disappoint, my only complaint is they only have Tabasco for hot sauce. Come on people, get with it.   The wife wasn't as happy with the menu, she's a bit more picky than I am, but found the Swordfish to be a good dinner, but not great. The fish and potatoes both were very bland but thankfully there was a nice pesto sauce to bring them along.",

We walked in and were seated right away (we went at about 5PM so it wasn't crowded). The waitress was very nice took the order for our drinks. Mark and I have a fun thing we do..we each pick a drink for the other, not telling each other what the other will be drinking (generally an alcoholic beverage).  It just makes it fun!  Anyway, we also each had a biscuit with a honey butter glaze on it w/ sides of home made butter and strawberry jam. Very good.    We then ordered our dinner.  Mark ordered the Blackened Chicken and I had the Chicken Pot Pie.  When the food came...OMG!! talk about a BIG portion!! My Chicken Pot Pie...it was enough to where it could feed me for 3-4 days...lol.  Marks dinner came and it was a good portion as well.  The only thing I didn't care for was that the crust was bland, had no real taste (otherwise it was great!!).  I tasted Mark's food and it was very good.  I ended up having the waitress box my left overs up (it took 2 box's)and Marks as well.   The check was about $63.00..(Oh and we also bought the glass's we drank out of that have the logo on them) not bad for the portions as I rather leave full and with doggy bags then still be hungry. All in all Id give it 4 stars. The service was great, the place was clean and everyone was nice and courteous which is always a plus!!  Would I go back? yes...would I recommend it? yes.  I enjoyed my experience there and you will to :)",

The \"large pizza\" looking flapjack tasted great, not too sweet.  Although I did like the Blueberry Pecan flapjack better.  I also ordered a side of crispy potatoes, which was addicting. The griddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream tasted better than it sounds.  And the Sage Fried Chicken with Bacon Waffles didn't only look breathtaking, but was outstanding in taste.  There was actual bacon strips inside the waffle!    I'm working my way up to the one-pound stuffed burgers.  Give me a month...",

Our food came out pretty quickly and everything was good, though I will say that the location in San Diego was better. While the portions were really large for most places, they were much smaller than the SD location, though that's not a bad thing since there was no place to take leftovers for us and it feels a bit weird to eat a burger with a knife and fork because it's literally impossible to pick it up. Service was a bit slow, but not annoyingly so. I wouldn't be afraid to hit it up again the next time I'm in Vegas.",

The only thing I can say positively is that the descriptions of the large portions are accurate - they are generous. Everything else was mediocre. The coffee was so-so, not bad, just so-so.   I tried the vaunted sage fried chicken with maple syrup reduction. I asked the waiter to serve the syrup separately and am I glad I did. The chicken itself was too crusted and greasy. Juicy enough, but otherwise flavorless. I tried a forkful of meat dipped into the syrup and it turned out cloyingly sweet. So I ate the rest of the meat with a little pepper and ketchup.   I did have some leftovers for a small, late lunch while I traipsed around the rest of Vegas, so I guess that is a positive as well.   So head there if you simply want to fill up your gut, but otherwise it's not really up to the hype.",

I found my Hamburger, while good, to be less than stellar.  But the portion size was nearly mind bending.  The other major potential disadvantage is the wait.  Since all the food is prepared fresh, don't expect to wait less than 30 minutes for it.  I witnessed one couple grow very unhappy with the waitress over this fact.  At the very least I can recommend it because of how amazing the overall experience is. Where else can you find a four waffles separated by two chickens on a skewer? or a Pancake so large that it has to be rolled up to fit in the go box?",

You have to take the escalator behind the bar up to get to it and you will wait no matter what time of day or night you go.  The servers are nice and very fast and they have to be fast.  This place is always packing.  We went for lunch but we did see some breakfast items go past us.  Pancake I swear was size of hubcap; chicken and waffles had to be about a foot high on the plate.  Hubby had the BBBLT sandwich which had almost half a head of lettuce, almost a whole tomato, about 8 slices of bacon, and milk bread that was about 2 inches thick. It came with a steak knife stabbed in the middle holding it together.  I had the cob salad platter - errrrr I mean plate.  Big chunks of everything in it including a whole avocado and a biscuit about the size of a softball.  A lot of people were gawking at other tables food orders cause they were all huge.  One guy at a table behind us just stared at his plate for awhile before he figured out how to attack it.  The prices aren't too bad, but you get food enough and then some for what you pay.

I'll admit, even I had a difficult time finishing my meal because the portion size is huge...and normally, I am disappointed in places because of the lack of quantity.  This place was showcased on Food Network....so that was cool to hear.  Recommend you really bring your appetite with you here, otherwise be prepared to have leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day.  Good job Hash House!!!",

It is, gluttony at its best.    Anna L. and I split Andy's Sage Fried Chicken with fresh spinach, tomatoes, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream, and scrambled eggs.  Apparently, this dish is a fave of Adam from Man vs. Food.  The dish was really good especially the chipotle cream.  It gave a nice spiciness to the dish.  The only downside...the chicken was lukewarm and not hot.    Other dishes that we ordered were the chicken and waffles, banana french toast (if I were craving sweets, that is probably what I would order), and corned beef and hash.  The drinks are delish esp. the watermelon lemonade cooler and mint mocha.    Good prices, clean restaurant, good food, and great service makes Jen a happy chica!",

He was right there with the water, napkins, etc. Everyone working tonight just seemed genuinely happy. I was digging the vibe. The food was great (like always). Great people and great food.

As we were walking to our table, we saw the huge amounts of food served, so were prepared to order accordingly.  I immediately went to my tried and True chicken-fried steak, and the wife had Andy's Indiana sage chicken.  When we got our food, I was amazed that even when we tried to order light, the food was humongous!  There was no way I was going to finish the delicious steak, and started on plan B; what can I bring home for a snack!  Well, I was only able to finish half, and enjoyed the gravy and biscuit along with the perfectly fried steak.  Before leaving, I signed up for the 55 and over discount, and received my two beer glasses (no, not that type), for my efforts, and a discount of 10 percent.  I really wish there was a Hash House a Go Go in the Los Angeles or Orange County area (hint, hint), so I could enjoy the experience again and have some great food with plenty of left-overs!",

My boyfriend is a foodie and he got a burger the size of my face and loved it. Similarly, the kids in our group were delighted that their pancakes and waffles were literally bigger than their heads.   But I tend to be on the pickier side and so I ordered a vanilla bean waffle. I honestly didn't pick up on any vanilla taste nor did I see any signs of vanilla beans. It tasted the same as a free waffle at a continental breakfast. And that would have been fine, but for the fact that it cost as much as it did. The 5-year-old at our table and I were served literally the same waffle, identical in size, but hers was $5 on the kids' menu and came with bacon, while mine was almost $15 and didn't come with any sides. That didn't really work for me.   So all in all, I'd recommend this place if you're a foodie or looking for something \"crazy\" or weird. If you just want a normal portion of a rather-plain breakfast food, it will be cheaper and easier to go elsewhere.",

The food is large and there is plenty of it, but it lacks in both quality and taste. Came on a Friday morning, party of five, sat right away.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy and wanted the \"crispy fried potatoes\" which were anything but crispy. They were actually fried a deep brown and I had hoped but they were soft and really under seasoned.  The gravy was flavorless and they slipped so much in my plate it was hard to see my fruit (which was partially covered in gravy, because that's a thing I guess?).  The other dishes on the table were the ham and spinach scramble, with \"griddled mashed potatoes\" that were supposed to have crunchy griddled bits of goodness in them, but we couldn't find any.  Waffle was a waffle, cooked well and crispy but like everything else, large and excessive. It's their thing.  Kids chicken fingers got eaten quickly and were enjoyed by the resident chicken finger expert. Ranch was tangy and seemed homemade.  I wanted to love the Hash-House a Go-Go, but it's an overpriced and underwhelming experience.  On the plus side, the staff was attentive and friendly and the coffee was hot and strong. My cup was never empty and my waitstaff was very attentive.",

We'd all been here before so we all went to our \"usuals\" for dinner. Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles, Hash House Chicken Fried Steak (Tuesday's Blue Plate Special) and Stuffed Meatloaf.   The Chicken & Waffles are a site to behold and taste even better! Two big pieces of perfectly fried chicken on Waffles with bacon INSIDE them served with a maple syrup that is to die for! The Chicken Fried Steak was crispy and smothered in not just gravy, but sausage gravy. OMG!  And then there is the stuffed meatloaf. Why would they stuff meatloaf?  Because it tastes better with spinach, red peppers, mozzarella cheese and covered in a Marsala cream sauce. Call a doctor!  I've eaten at the other HHaGGs and they are just not as good as this one.  Stop by and you will see for yourself!",

    "text": "Dishes Tried: - Crab cake benedict - Corned (pulled beef) beef hash - Kids waffles/pancakes  Rather than deal with the two locations down near the strip, we went off the beaten path to this Hash House to get our breakfast fix.  Everyone at the restaurant was courteous and friendly however the food would have to be rated as just your average run of the mill breakfast.  My crab cakes were good, eggs poached to just the right consistency however the spicy sauce and potatoes were lackluster.    The same goes for the corned beef hash, it's unique in that they use pulled beef. However we were a little disappointed with the flavors of the dish as a whole.  The star were the kids waffles and pancakes, although they were the simplest dishes our kids loved them.  Can't beat simplicity for breakfast when dining with kids.  One comes to Hash House for the wow factor of their portions and interesting flavor combinations.  However not everything works together as it may seem on the menu.",

I've been here several times but only today did I go with their featured item, the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. Rather than lay out the food about the plate this dish has the items stacked one atop another with a wooden spike holding them upright. There were two chicken breasts, nicely cooked and breaded. Good tasting. The Waffles were more average. Hey, waffles are waffles to me. There was caramelized bacon inserted inside the waffles. Different, not bad, just different.  The portion size for one person is huge. If I was living locally I would probably end up taking a good portion of the meals here back home.  Service was excellent. Another nice visit to one of my favorite food places in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Okay, so I eat really clean and exercise a lot, but on the weekends, I like to have my cheat meals, and this is my place of choice!  The portions are gigantic.  This place makes Claim Jumper's portions look like kid's meals.  The food is AMAZE BALLS!  Seriously.  Like I said, I eat really clean, so I avoided this place for years, because I thought it would be all greasy and gross until finally trying it about 6 months ago.  Since then, I've returned at least 2x a month.  Not greasy or gross at ALL!  The food is \"farm fusion\" which basically means they take midwest type food and put a spin on it.  I am a good cook and can make basically everything at a regular breakfast joint.  But not Hash House.  NOPE.  I would not even attempt to make anything they make.  It is perfection.  Perfection I tell you!  Complicated dishes that melt in your mouth.  I have tried many of their items, but my favorite is their Sage Chicken and Waffles. We also love their Biscuits and Gravy dish, served on the most wonderful mashed potatoes I've ever had in my life.  We also love the pancakes and the Banana French Toast.  Okay, so we love everything!  The prices may look a bit steep for a breakfast to some people, but the fact that the food will truly feed 2 people per portion slashes that price in half!  And, if you are bringing your kids, they have pancakes that are bigger than a traditional dinner plate and they are $3.  That is just nuts.  Go NOW!  If you haven't, you're truly missing out.  But, don't go at like 9 am on the weekends, though.  That is when I go and I don't want to have to wait behind you for a table. ;)  (We go early b/c we have kids, and we've never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for a table.  But, when we are leaving, there is usually a wait.  Man, I'm sharing all my secrets now.)",

I ordered a pork tenderloin eggs benedict and it was 9\" high! The pork tenderloin was hammered thin and tender, and it was 12\" across! Plus, it has a grapefruit sized portion of mashed potatoes on the side along with some fruit. At it's not just lumped on there. The presentation is fantastic.  I was sitting at the bar and when they delievered my food the people waiting for their tables started gathering around me to take pictures of my plate. It was seriously that impressive.  It's not just the portions that impress either. Instead of a traditional hollandaise sauce for the eggs benedict, they have specific sauces for each style you order. Since mine was the pork, they had an amazing creamy teriyaki sauce that had some caramel flavors in it. Absolutely fantastic! You could cook a shoe in that stuff and it would taste great!  The drink menu is also amazing. I had a kiwi watermelon lemonade, and it was served in a tall class with all three layers seperated. Red on top, white in the middle, and green at the bottom. It looked like the Italian flag.  The only drawback to this place is that it is so freaking popular, that you will almost always have a long wait. But it's hard to rate them down for that. They can't help it if 100 people show up at the same time for lunch.",

The server didn't seem to know what beer they had and they didn't have anything on tap.  And then he tried to convince me that the Sierra Nevada was a Hefeweizen while it was actually a Pale Ale.  And I wouldn't have minded normally, but I really dislike Sierra Nevada... :(  We ordered the tiger prawns with chili mayo appetizer. The presentation was pretty creative.  They skewered 3 deep fried prawns and stuck it on a large watermelon wedge.  The flavour was actually just okay... I've had better.. and only 3 prawns???? :-S  The Chicken and Waffles though were quite filling and tasty.  I prefer more maple syrup, but they were happy to bring it. And the portions are huge.  Definitely share a dish!   When the bill came, there were several discrepancies between the menu prices for the beers and the bill prices.  So what could have and should have been a 3 or 4 star, is now actually 2 stars.   I may give it another chance though next time I'm in Vegas.",

The presentation of the food was nice...served in a skillet dish along side of fruit, biscuit, and eggs.

I think all of the chicken dishes were ok, but not FABU. I still stand by that the garlic mashed potatoes are THE best potatoes I have ever had.

A drink was forgotten about, we didn't have enough silverware, and never received the extra sauce we asked for. We will be back and hopefully get a better server next visit.",

    "text": "What is all the hype about? Seemed like Hash House A Go Go was a good breakfast joint with over 2,700 reviews averaging 4 stars. Unfortunately, my experience was mediocre at best.  SERVICE Impeccable service by a friendly and knowledgeable server. Forgot his name but he was very polite.   FOOD My server briefly went over the menu and said their scrambles are popular so I went with their Farm Scrambles. There are three options of different ingredients and I went with #3 which came with sun-dried tomato, basil and goat cheese.   It is $11.99 and is a generous portion. Served with griddled mashed, crispy potato, fresh fruits with a choice of toast or homemade biscuit. Their homemade biscuit was extremely dry, similar to the one from Popeye's chicken. Crispy potato was overdone and was way past crispy. Scramble itself wasn't anything special. Made with tomato and basil with goat cheese sprinkled on top. Meh.   Another thing. I'm sorry to say this but I HATE the rosemary sprig they use for toasts and biscuits. First of all, it looks like a grass growing out from toast/biscuit and second of all, I hate the strong scent that comes out of it. The smell made me sick and I immediately lost my appetite when I accidentally brushed against it.    CONCLUSION Great service, mediocre food. I don't see myself coming back here again unless they stop using the rosemary sprig.",

    "text": "Definitely lives up to its name of farm food gone crazy... Or something like that.  I hit this place up every time I have a late night in Vegas and I need something to get me through the day.  I never go wrong with the Sage Chicken and Waffles... But you sure need a big appetite because it is a huge heaping plate of food.  I have only managed to eat 1/2 at most and that was a struggle.  What I do now is go with a friend and we split an order of the sage chicken and waffles and add a side of sausage.  That is enough for 2 normal adults.  The sage chicken is wonderful with great flavor that is not overpowering or greasy.  it is lightly fried with tender and flavorful meat.  The sage flavor is there but not too heavy so it compliments the fried chicken well.  The waffles are great and it has bacon slices inside so when you bite it, you get both bacon and waffle in the same bite.  Put some maple syrup on it and I am in heaven.  It also comes with the home made mashed potatoes which is great but who has space for that with the chicken and waffles?  The sausages are also very juicy and I order it just to round out the breakfast feel, but it's optional for you if you don't want any more food.  I would say go to this one on Charleston though and skip the one in the M Resort.  My friends who have gone to both say the one in M Resort is not as good as the original restaurant.",

They were amazed at the portion sizes of what they ordered. Most of them took to go boxes and put in the ice chest for their meal once they got back to California. College kids always eat leftovers. Just stopped by here on January 2 with my twins again and it seems that the portions are a little smaller (not complaining as I hate to waste food), the food was barely warm when it came to the table but I guess we were all starving. I did however send my biscuit back because you can't eat a fresh biscuit COLD. The waiter was quick to bring me a warm one with butter. Coffee cups were never empty and the prices are reasonable.",

After some tinkering on the Yelp app, we found this other location 6 miles away. Desperate for inexpensive yummy breakfast at 1130am, we decided to take an Uber to grub.  After blasting some Celine Dion and Opera music in our Uber vehicle, we finally found ourselves at our destination. There were no casinos, no high-rises and tourists in sight. There was a vape shop and a Pet shop next to Hash House. I said to myself \"so this is what Vegas looks like 6 miles away from the strip?\". We were so off the beaten path that you couldn't see a single Vegas strip hotel from where we were standing.  verdict: Between the humongous pancakes, chicken & waffles and #1 egg scramble, our meal was absolutely delicious. Never have I had fried chicken so sweet and battered up so well. The other breakfast plates were big portioned and tasted great. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive to our table. Is this off-strip Hash House A Go Go worth an Uber trip? I would happily do so again in a heartbeat.",

The chipotle sauce is flavorful and has a bit of spicy. You can ask them for more sauce and drench the mash potatoes and the biscuit in the sauce. The sage chicken is juicy but I got to try the pork loin eggs benedict and the pork loin tastes better. The pork loin was juicer and pairs better with the sauce. Don't get me wrong, the chicken is crunchy but the pork loin is meatier.   You probably won't be able to finish it so be prepare to get a to go box or split a dish with a friend.",

Kinda cold, music waay too loud, but in their defense I was pretty hangry (hungry+angry).  On the menu it says to allow them time to make the food like your mom does it. Don't rush them, everything is from scratch. Okay, I'm cool with that. So we order; he got the French Toast and I did the Corned Beef Hash with sunny side eggs.   We wait.   Finally the food comes. The food runner brings it out using towels because (I assume) the plate and cast iron skillet are just too hot to handle....Psych! I'm wrong and the food is cold. Not room temperature...cold. It's been sitting for so long that the meat and the eggs feel cold in my mouth. Nasty.  Our server, Summer, was super amazing and understanding. She explained that they don't have microwaves or food lamps (which means the food must've been sitting there forever). If it wasn't for her being so cool and nice about the situation I would've been inclined to rate this place a big, fat, 1 star.   But she (sorta) saved the day. The new food was brought out very, very quickly (which makes me wonder what the BOH staff was doing the whole time. This place was probably 1/4 full). Food was slightly better but still not overwhelmingly delicious. It wouldn't break my heart if we never ate here again.   tl;dr \"Meh\"",

This place has tons of other stuff I'd love to try but every time I come I end up getting Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict! Try it when if you're in town not too far from the Strip. There are two locations in Vegas and I've tried both. I recommend the original which is not on the strip. it's not too far away and well worth the drive. One of the tastiest breakfast meals I've ever had.",

When I went in there at about 8:15pm the night I went, it was fairly slow for a Friday, I think I missed the dinner rush.  No matter.  The server told me it was a lot of food for one person, but I brought my appetite.  I got about 2/3rd's through before calling it quits.  Next time I might share that plate with someone, or go for the chicken sandwich with fries.  It was 20.00, but it was worth it.  I'll share it next time.  Also a very popular place with the famous people with all of the autographed photos and posters around of them praising the company.",

    "text": "Note from the top: this review is for Breakfast only.   Note #2: there are 3 or 4 of these in Vegas, I ate at the new Linq casino and hotel, nice atmosphere!  Winner winner! A totally unique restaurant concept with oversized, high quality food and drinks, plus an energetic wait staff. I was told it was a 40-minute wait but it turned out to be only 20 minutes tops (930 AM weekday).   The food is exquisitely prepared, menu is highly creative blue collar Americana cuisine, and they use plenty of herbs and spices to make the presentations and tastes go way north of blue collar food.   The portions are about 1.5-2 times what you would expect from any restaurant serving similar American food.  A bit pricey yes, but not ridiculously so (breakfasts are about $13.00-18.00, and considering you're in Vegas where steaks routinely go for $55.00-60.00, this is a small premium for a great American, creative, and gargantuan breakfast.   Fresh squeezed OJ, any kind of side you want, and it appears from the menu that the owners are from Indiana, cuz they serve up that pork tenderloin and fried chicken like total Hoosiers! (This is a smallish chain with about 8 locations, mostly in Vegas, but also Chicago, Orlando, San Diego, and Mohegan Sun Casino, CT).  Ok, I had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. It was amazing and I didn't regret not getting the famous waffles and Fried Chicken, which looked so large and beautiful that I wanted the dish after I saw a few of them come out of the kitchen.  No regrets and I'll eat there again, I'm quite sure.",

When we got there they said they did not allow dogs in their outdoor seating area.  I don't fault them for that; we should have checked.  I need to remember that not everywhere is as dog-friendly as the Bay Area. So we got takeout instead. We shared the fried chicken and eggs, bacon, potatoes and biscuit ($14 or so) and the blueberry pancake ($9).  The portions are monstrous.  The pancake came in (and filled) a pizza box.  However, the food was just not that great.  The pancake was too sweet and also very dry.  I didn't think the fried chicken was bad but it wasn't great.  My husband liked it even less than I did.  The eggs and potatoes were similarly mediocre.  The biscuit was pretty awful.   It's the sort of place that I would probably try again if I lived in Vegas. Perhaps we ordered the wrong thing or perhaps takeout is not as good as in-restaurant dining.  But based on our meal I don't think it's a destination place.",

No mayonnaise whatsoever and they stack so much lettuce into sandwich that it dominates the bacon.  Additionally, the toast was way to big and I felt like I was eating Toast and Lettuce.  Not good at all. and for $11.95???? Definitely not worth it. (3) To top it all off, the wait staff took 10 minutes between giving us water and taking our order.  I saw 3 different tables get their orders in before our waitress even came back to us... that just made the wait that much longer. (4) Manager that day had no idea what he was serving. Sure it's nice enough that you come out and deliver the food to the table.  The order didn't look right and he was absolutely unsure of what he had in his hands when we questioned what it was... yeesh, study your menu yeah?  The only saving grace for this place was the Kiwi Watermelon drink.... would definitely come back here simply for that drink and one the most fresh tasting and refreshing drinks I've had in a long time.    1 star for the food. 1 star for the staff. 5 stars for the drink. = 2 stars overall.    See the big portions once for yourself, then do yourself a favor and go elsewhere to find better tasting food.",

The second time had the fired chicken and waffles. It's True that the portions are HUGE. I appreciated that the chicken was boneless, but all together everything was dry and pretty salty. There is bacon in the waffles which would be a nice touch, but there isn't enough of it. I was also with a particularly picky person and he wanted one of their burgers, but with a chicken breast instead of beef. The only way the waitress could accommodate the order was to bring him all of the components separately and have him assemble them on his own. It just seemed weird. All together- meh...",

    "text": "When people write of the downfall of America, Hash House A Go Go must be included.  I say that because if we all go here, it will makes us fat, happy and complacent.  I ate there five days ago and I think Im still full.  Giant portions are but a small (Large?) measure of Hash's greatness.    Working under the moniker \"Twisted Farm Food,\" Hash has the decor of an industrial style barn.  While being seated, you notice every table gawking at other tables in sheer awe of what is being delivered to other tables.  Imagine being at a Hospital nursery and all the babies are 25 lbs, and the fathers are just looking at each other and smiling.  That's whats going on here.    First thing I noticed was the prices...they're really cheap for the amount of food I saw coming out.  I dont think anything was more than $15.  The waitress explained that the restaurant makes everything from scratch and that there are no heat lamps meaning food can be brought out at different times.  Working under that guise, I contemplated what would I like to try in giant form and made of scratch that Ive probably never had before.  I settled on the Pounded Pork Tenderloin sandwich with crispy french fries.  When my sandwich came out, I desperately asked my waitress for tactical help on how to eat it.  The sandwich was so large I had no idea where to begin.  She laughed no doubt having heard that 100's of times before.  I finally dove in and found the pork cutlet to be tender and tasty.  Not the absolute best I ever had, but for the price and the portions I felt it was more than acceptable.  The fries were excellent and actually crispy...rare is it when a restaurant advertises crispy these days and actually delivers a crispy product.  My party also really enjoyed their oversized sandwiches of various ilk.    As we descended into dreams of wearing elastic pants for our expanded waistlines, we became part of the peanut gallery looking at other peoples tables and what they had ordered.  The burgers are ginormous and the breakfasts really steal the show.  Pancakes the size of pizzas, hash brown servings that must be made of two full potatoes and toast truly of the \"Texas\" variety.  There are so many things I need to go back and try but these trips must be rationed for health's sake.  Service was very friendly and accommodating and there was relatively little wait to be seated although I do know on weekends at brunch time you will wait awhile (I see it whenever I drive by).  Another great added benefit was that with my $13 sandwich I was able to get a full 3 meals out of it.  Three!!!     This restaurant truly embodies the ethos: \"Only in America.....:",

I had never heard of it, so I decided to do some research and check out their website online prior to going.  My mouth was watering even before ever going there!  We got there right as soon as the place opened.  We opted to not go to the one on the strip because we figured it would be much busier.  There were people waiting outside, and soon after we were seated, the rush began and didn't stop when we left.  Our waitress was cute and dorky.  Actually, most of the staff seemed to be right up that alley, but it all had a very smooth way of working out in the best interest of the business and created a nice atmosphere.  I decided to try the corned beef hash (obviously I am a huge fan) and my fiance had the sage fried chicken benedict.  HOLY CRAP.  I knew the pictures online made the food look big, but I never imagined that the portions would be like this.  YOU CAN EASILY SPLIT A MEAL WITH SOMEONE IF YOU WANTED TO AND STILL BE STUFFED.  My hash came out with CHUNKS of corned beef, not the crap from the can.  It seemed fresh like they just got it out of the crock pot and was piled with a mound of crispy potatoes and swiss cheese.  My fiance's food was AMAZING too!  I cannot even begin to describe the abundance of flavor in the sage chicken!  I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone and everyone who likes good food and a lot of it.  I would have taken my leftovers with us, but we were in a hotel that didn't have a mini-fridge or microwave for reheating.  They need to bring this out to the desert heat in AZ because I am sure there would be quite the crowd and appetite for it.",

Buddy and I both ordered Stellas at the bar. Took a good 15+ min to deliver the order because something was a bit weird with the machine. The bartender told us drinks were on him for the inconvenience. So that was cool.   I ordered the Mashed Potatoes & Bacon Burger.  First impression was....eh it isnt that big. After eating half the burger i determined that the size itself wasnt the issue it was the lack of depth.   The beef patties arent seasoned so they have a very generic taste. The mashed potatoes were too light in flavor and contributed very little to the overall burger cept for filler and the bacon was just bacon. There was no stable meat to condiment ratio. Each bite was like getting punched in the face with flavorless beef.  The fries were good and the meal was good for how much we paid for them. If i ever go back i'm going to order something other then the burgers.",

Extra points for the creativity and the crispy outside soft inside texture. However the flavor is not particularly memorable. Also the sage fried chicken benedict is just mediocre. Can't taste sage in the chicken and the texture is a bit tough. Most important there was barely any egg. Nothing special.   Service is decent and seating is comfortable.  The portion is big but the price is also higher comparing to other similar restaurants.  All in all it's a solid 3 stars.",

We came on a Monday (right before we returned to CA), and it wasn't as busy as I thought, but it was a Monday and people eating there on this day are probably locals.  My friend's girlfriend said that this location is much bigger than the San Diego location.  The portions are huge, go hungry or be prepared to share.  If you do share, order a side because you'll be charged a plate splitting fee - this was suggested by our server - if I remember correctly, the splitting fee cost more than ordering a side.  He was one of the best servers I have experienced.  People are not kidding when they say the portions are huge.  I saw the pork tenderloin being served to someone, it seriously looked like the size of my head.  We went with the chicken and waffles with a side of bacon.  I guess we totally missed reading the description because inside the waffles there are whole slices of bacon!  The chicken was fried perfectly, but the maple sauce was just too sweet for my taste with the chicken, it's nice with the waffle though.  My friend and his girlfriend got this scramble (don't know the name) but it had avocado, bacon, and other stuff, it looked really good, I think that's what I'll order next time I go.  Overall, this is a nice place to try and experience, especially the next morning after a night of clubbing and drinking!",

Chicken and Waffles were okay. Sage Fried Chicken was good, but inconsistent. Sometimes its very good, and sometimes, not so much. The waffles however are always terrible. Being as how they have bacon inside them, you would think they would be great. We always end up pulling the bacon out and eating that alone.  They have good strong coffee and the Jam Du jour is tasty. My favorite dish is the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, but sometimes the potatoes come out cold. They have great plate presentations, but even that cannot cover up some of the small protein portions on the dinners, like the MIxed Grill special they often have. Much of this place is hype, so just stick with the breakfast there and you'll be fine.",

    "text": "This review is primarily focused on the service. Came to this location last Sunday for brunch. It was very busy considering that it was around 1:30 pm. This is the only hash house that is located in a single standing building. The others are within hotels/casinos.  The wait took about 40 minutes for a table for 4. Our waitress, Erin, had a very flat affect straight from the start. She wasn't very friendly nor helpful.  I asked her if the couples could split the bill and she said it would be fine. We ordered our entrees, which consisted of the sun dried tomatoes, basil and goat cheese farm scrambles, buttermilk flapjacks and the French toast. All were very tasty and had good portions. One of the downfalls to the food was the amount of syrup they gave with the French toast and flapjacks. They gave a tiny shot glass worth of syrup for each dish. We had to ask for extra syrup about 3 times because these dishes needed the syrup. So when the bill comes, it had not been split, so I quickly reminded her to split the bill. I was going to mention which dishes on the credit cards but she replied \"I know what dishes you guys got\" in a very rude tone. Yeeesh. She looked at my boyfriend and asked which card was his. He told her his name. The other couple's card had his picture on it. So when she returns with the split bills, she still managed to screw everything up and mix up the items with the cards. At this point, I was quite frustrated so I went back to look for her and just told her what had happened. She apologized but it honestly didn't seem like she cared.  We wanted to leave so we just signed the bills without changing them and left.   This experience left a sour taste in my mouth. The service at the other hash houses are pretty good. Not sure if I want to go to this location again.",

    "text": "I know this place has great reviews but I won't be eating here again. The food was okay (even though they didn't get our order right), and the service was okay too. I just can't get over the portion sizes, it is such a waste! I didn't see a single person around me finishing their plate. And what are we teaching our children? What message are we sending to adults? I would much rather pay 1/2 the price and receive half the food. Heck, I'd pay the same price for half the food if it were really tasty!  We went on a Saturday morning and early enough to beat the huge rush (we got there about 9:30 or 10am). Our wait was about 20 minutes, while the wait was an hr. plus when we left. We sat inside and while we waited we watched huge platters of food being brought out of the kitchen and instantly determined we'd be sharing a meal.  We ordered the Tractor Driver Combo: 2 eggs over medium, bacon and a blueberry pecan pancake ($13.95). We added a side of Biscuits and Gravy. The meal came out and they'd given us potatoes instead of bacon, but brought us bacon when we complained - so hey free potatoes (although I didn't care for the rosemary seasoning, I didn't think it went with the sweetness of the pancake). Also as we cut into our eggs it was obvious that they were not cooked to medium, even the egg whites were runny.. the eggs ran into the pancake which is a big pet peeve of mine. The pancake was HUGE! Together we didn't even eat 1/3 of it! It was good but came with a very small side of syrup, I imagine people are constantly asking for more syrup. I would have if I'd eaten more of my gigantic pancake.  The food didn't wow us. I didn't try the biscuits and gravy, but the bf didn't finish them so that says a lot, generally he would. Our conversation the entire meal was about how unhealthy the portion sizes were, how it was almost to the point of making us lose our appetites, and how we watched person after person send away their plates with tons of food still on them *thankfully*. It's unfortunate that other countries are starving and we rave about places with portion sizes that should feed multiple people. I'll get off my soap box, but I'll not be visiting here again.",

Now that the back story is out of the way onto the review.  Let me tell you what trying this place is definitely not something we regret.   I'll start off with the staff, we got there around 10:30 a.m. it was packed, so it was a few minutes before we were greeted ( which is understandable). The hostess greeted us and told us it would be about 15 minutes. Which wasn't a problem, we waited a few minutes and then asked if we could just sit at the bar, and were told that was fine. The bartended was a fun upbeat guy, he asked us where we were from what we were doing in Vegas and even congratulated us on our wedding, in not so short the staff was awesome..  Now the food. If your going to eat here either bring your appetite or a large friend with you because the portion size is massive.. The coffees they offer are absolutely delicious.. I don't remember the name of the dish we ordered ( yes just one cause damn) but it had chicken, asparagus, potatoes, two eggs and a  biscuit the size of a baby's face.. It was a pretty tasty meal. My only complaints is one the chicken was a little bland and we couldn't finish it.. All in all a must if your in Vegas..",

First off when I walked in the door this place was full of people everywhere waiting to be seated (not that this is a bad thing, but don't pick this location if you're in a rush!) So we put our name on the list. After a 10-15min wait we were seated and this is where the problems began. We were given menus to look over, after 10minutes I asked a waiter walking by if she could send someone to take our drink orders. She apologized and said someone would be right over. So then the waiter came and we placed our drink and food order. Both came out promptly. I ordered the chicken and waffle dish which if you like bacon is pretty good. The waffles have strips of bacon cooked inside. Other than the customer service mix up the food was good and I would've given this restaurant a 4/5 star",

I had the Chicken Benedict w/ smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, roasted red pepper cream, and two basted eggs. It was served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mash.  I could not finish the biscuit or griddled mash.   No one in our party could even come close to finishing their dinner...

I orered the Sage Chicken Benedict and in theory it sounds delicious and even has a Man vs. Food endorsement, but it was gross. It should have been called the trash plate or the left over plate because it seemed like something you'd make when all of the left overs from the week came together in one dish. The biscuits here are the worst biscuits ever made as they aren't flakey or buttery but big dough blobs. There were too many flavors on the plate and at the end I just felt sick. I am not a huge fan of mash potatoes to begin with but mashed potatoes under chicken, biscuits, eggs, cheese, and this sauce was just too much. Oh, and the food was not hot at all just slightly warm leftovers on a huge plate...  I did taste my friend's banana pancakes and they were delicious, but everyone else's food was just meh.",

Although the food is three-four stars, what really makes this place a five star is the staff. Immediately as I walked in with my brother, and friend we were greeted with a genuine good afternoon. The staff is very lively, bright, and great. Their customer service was unbelievable, one of the best I had ever seen. The table next to us were a couple of kids complaining about their waffle, one of the girls said it tasted funny and would like the waffle to be free. Without any hesitation the waiter immediately offered her new waffle and for it to . Now that's some good customer service right there. The waiter that served us was also no exception. From the time that we ordered he was very polite and humble. We had trouble deciding what drinks we wanted to get and he gave his own personal opinion on which tasted better. And every time we needed a refill he was very prompt about refilling.   The ambiance of the place is very chill, and the parking was very easy. If I had the time to sit down and eat I would go back to this place for sure.",

The employees were so kind. The atmosphere was great and there portions were HUMONGO!!! I love that they had a bunch of pictures of all the celebrities that came in, signed, framed, and hanging on the walls.  Plus, the whole 'Vegas Feel' tops it off right.

    "text": "This place really does make you feel like you're in Vegas. Your food is either awesome or it sucks. I go to the casinos to gamble. I don't go to restaurants to gamble on taste. Sadly this is the reality of this place.  Food: I had the Chicken Sage with waffles. All style, no substance. Chicken was dry and flavorless. Waffles was mushy. I rather get the 99cents Popeyes Tuesday special and slap it on a double Waffle Cafe waffle and it would taste much better and be cheaper. Crabcake, salmon, swordfish, burger seems to be satisfactory. Both my chicken and salmon had maple syrup on it. Maple syrup has a really strong taste, so it absolutely overshadows other food. I guess its suppose to help season the chicken. But maple syrup on salmon? WTF. Maple syrup on the side next time please. Another person in our group had swordfish which was good, but it was cold. He had to mix it with the mash potatoes to warm it up. This is supposed to be twisted farm food, not twisted sushi bar. Despite all of this, 2 people in our group seem to really enjoy the meal. Looks like the dice rolled in the favor.  Service: This is probably unnecessary ripping, but since I'm on a roll anyways, might as well. Two things the waiter said stuck to me, we make everything \"home made\" so it'll take longer and because of this everything won't come out at once. Like really? I came to a restaurant to get \"home made\" dinner and expect it to take longer, otherwise I would have just went to my local Walmart and get a frozen dinner and blast it in the microwave and enjoy my meal in about 3 minutes. Secondly, just because it takes longer to make, does not excuse not timing the kitchen to get EVERYONE'S food out at the SAME time. It sucks being the last person waiting for food, watching everyone else eat. Food did come out separately as expected, but timing wasn't too bad. Maybe 1 or 2 minutes between each person. It's amazing they filled up everyone drinks in a timely manner, but couldn't get the 2 people in our group their placemats in a timely manner.   Price: Food ranges around $10-$12 for your burgers, $15-$20 for their gluttony creation. $25+ for some other meats. Price seems to be about right for what you're SUPPOSE to be getting. Don't forget this place takes <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> GC for dinner, so bring a friend or two to help you, it's a lot of food after all.

    "text": "Hey Nevada!  I'm what you would call a Las Vicago resident (Vegas/Chicago) who stumbled upon Hash House a Go Go last week.     Description: This place would be described as your one-stop breakfast hangover hangout. Consuming a meal of this size (I'm talkin' Barney Rubble) makes you wanna Go Go take a  Hash dump in the nearest bathroom.  The food was tasty but the portion itself makes you loose your appetite as I am a believer in small quantities of good quality.  My God, can you imagine how many starving children you could feed with the leftovers that are thrown out at this place.  My honest recommendation would be to purchase one plate for 2 people, especially if you have kids.  You do not want to waste your money for food that will just be thrown out at the restaurant or at home.  Nobody that I know eats leftover breakfast, especially after being heated up again in your car by the Nevada sun.   The entree just wasn't complete unless it was stacked up high and stabbed in the center with a Micheal  Myers knife or a banzai tree.  I ordered the fried chicken eggs Benedict served with a slab of fried chicken breast, potatoes, eggs, bacon, spinach, fried cheese, drizzled with a chipotle sauce and stabbed with a steak knife dead center.  Like I said it tasted good but was to too much food.  I think what sets this place off is the chef's artistic presentation of the food and the fact that Adam from \"Man vs Food\" was here.  Other people have a tendency to have fake inflated opinions when a celebrity is involved.    Service: We did not have to wait long to be seated but the 2 hostess's were not the friendliest.  The server, however, was friendly and had a cool city like nature to him.  You might have to remind your server for a few things because it gets pretty busy but other than that we didn't have many problems.  Conclusion: I would go back to Hash House a Go Go again because it was a fun and interesting place to take family and friends from out of town to try something new and different.",

The chicken is crispy, seasoned perfectly, moist and juicy.  It's perfectly complimented by two huge bacon filled waffles with a maple reduction.  If you only get one thing here, that's what you want.  I also highly recommend any of the \"hashes\" on the menu.  Great combinations of meat, eggs, potatoes and veggies with many many different options.  This place has a very unique take on breakfast, great food, and thankfully plenty of doggiebags.  This place is worth the wait, food coma and all.",

    "text": "Wow. Now me and my wife went to las vegas in the summer of 2012 and we made a special trip to hash house a go go becuse of the man vs food tv program. We spent 7 days in vegas and it was the only restaurant that we attended twice in a week. I must admit the portion sizes are ridiculously huge. I mean people have said to me American portions are big; but I have never been over faced too much. Hash house blew the size competition out of the water.  What about the food? I hear you ask. Well my Sarah had the blue cheese salad with extra fried chicken on top and we both agreed that it was the best salad we both had ever tasted.  Yes the best combinations ever. The salad was heavenly. 10 out of 10. Now to my dish; the famous fried sage chicken with waffles and bacon. It was good but not the best because the saltiness of the bacon just doesn't gel with the sweet pancakes. Dont get me wrong but I still highly recommend it to anyone. The fried chicken itself was very good but not the best in the world. Service was friendly but felt like it was all about the tip. Also the waiting on staff told us that food will just arrive on our table not together cause the chefs doesnt like leaving food hanging around on the hot pass. More like the chefs cant get their timing right!!!!. Conclusion: very good food. Huge portions and let your hair down and stuff your face. Will go back.",

    "text": "6/11/2012  I just left hash house a go go and I will never go back. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken had no flavor except for the maple syrup poured all over it. Sweet sticky meat with beading that tasted like fried white flour. The waffles had bacon inside, again dessert meat. I ordered a side of sausage gravy to try to salvage the chicken, I ate about a teaspoon, it was the consistency of thick pudding. Again thick flour taste with a bit of sausage mixed in. So needless to say I wasn't crazy about the food. However my real problem was the service. Kelly was my waitress, and while not exactly rude, not very helpful when she realized I had a problem. I told her I needed the gravy because I wasn't crazy about the syrupy chicken, she said \" yeah, some people don't like the sweet meat, I guess you learned!\". When I didn't eat much even after she brought the gravy she said, \"is it making you sick?, I'll get it out of your way\". I didn't ask for a free meal, and I was not comfortable saying more because of her comments. But the thing is, that she offered no options to rectify the situation, she did not send a manager over to talk to us, and charged us for everything. Really disappointing experience.",

Most out-of-towners give Hash House A No Go high marks whereas Vegas locals (which I was for 11 years) call it out for what it really is.  An expensive, over-hyped diner that made it on a few cable travel/food shows which consistently serves up large portions of crap.

While the food portions are definitely huge, I just felt the food wasn't anything to make you want to write home about. I had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken, which was tasty and extremely filling. My wife ordered the chicken pot pie and was not very impressed with the breading.       Another issue to beware of is that they \"decorate\" the plates with a ring of hot sauce for no apparent reason. I personally like spicy food, but we had family members with us who don't and were not particularly happy about this. Please note that nowhere on the menu does it state that your entree will be served with a hot sauce garnish. They need to be more aware that some guests may be have pepper allergies or turned off by this. Kind of an odd twist anyway, in my opinion.        On the whole, the food and service were decent enough. I was just not impressed to the point where I would go out of my way to recommend this restaurant over some others. The \"A Go-Go\" is just \"a so-so\"",

You don't get to pick a size so I assumed it would be a few pancakes covered in blueberries and gooey goodness. Nope. It was as big as a large pan pizza and the texture of the flapjack wasn't what I was accustomed to - somewhat dry and crumbled under my fork. The flapjack was so dry, no matter how much darn syrup I poured over it, it would suck it all up like the syrup behemoth it was! FYI: they don't give you enough syrup to choke it all down. I finished about 1/4 of it. Boo. My boyfriend and his friend got the famous corned beef hash. They seemed to thoroughly enjoy it; I didn't like the sight of that hash (TMI: looked like skinned earthworms) and they did comment that the crispy potatoes that came with it weren't that tasty.  I wouldn't mind trying something else here but why bother when there are so many other places to try?",

    "text": "This is one of four Hash House locations throughout the Las Vegas area. This one is not located in a casino so parking is much easier.  They serve big portions so don't come here unless you plan on eating - a lot. Otherwise, it's a terrible waste of food. I hope they are part of a food composting program.  The Boston Hash special, which had potatoes and peppers topped with a big Maryland blue crab cake and a spicy remoulade sauce, was a different combination. The crab flavor came through, but was a bit mushy. The scrambled eggs were good and not rubbery. It also came with a very good biscuit. The corned beef hash was simpler than the Boston hash with long strings of beef mixed with cheese on top of potatoes. It also came with the same scrambled eggs and big biscuit.  This is not an old school diner, but an updated version. For example, I had a very nice tangerine juice. Divey diners don't serve fresh juice - let alone tangerines. But let's be clear, it's still diner food. I think customers are overly fascinated with the portion size and ignoring the quality of the food. Take the Boston Hash I had. It had a soft crab cake, soft potatoes, soft peppers, soft eggs, and a soft biscuit. If a texturally-challenged dish like this was served at a Michelin-starred restaurant, it would get ripped apart by unhappy customers as being mushy baby food.  I was tempted to order their 1-pound burger. But hey, it's ONE POUND! That's ridiculous. And this is coming from a guy who, the night before, weighed 148.4 pounds before going to dinner, ate and drank at four places, and then weighed 152.4 pounds after dinner.  (The rooms at the Encore hotel have digital scales.)  One pound is not a problem for someone who can consume four pounds in one night.",

My favorite was the biscuit and the mashed potatoes but I wasn't too crazy about the sauce that was all over it (a little spicy). Presentation and portions are definitely impressive. I was happy to take huge leftovers for later in the day. Overall I think I would come back if I come to vegas with friends that haven't been here before.  Decently priced for vegas as well.",

I ordered the French Toast dish and that was pretty good.  the portion is big here so I recommend sharing.  All my friends got the Man vs Food special Fried Chicken Benedict all of them were happy with their decision.   I recommend this place to others looking for a serious American breakfast.  The tractor in front of the shop is pretty awesome too..This place is a solid 5 STARS!!!",

    "text": "So, I wish I could give this restaurant zero stars, maybe even negative zero stars. Everything about this joint is mediocre, the decor, the food, the service. My fiance and I went to this crappy establishment during the day before I had to go to work, My fiance got the most awful, lame, dried out, under seasoned mushroom and swiss burger on the face of our planet earth. This thing was huge, it was like three pounds of elephant dung. Are you kidding me? Who does't salt and pepper a burger? It tasted like nothing! Not only that but they had the nerve to put a pickle on it, Wanna know what goes on a Mushroom and Swiss Hamburger????? Hamburger, a bun, and MUSHROOM AND FREAKING SWISS!! Not a pickle! And to boot, you pay 10 dollars for a hamburger, then you have to pay an extra almost 4$ for lame lame lame french fries, or whatever whack side they have available! She wanted ranch for her fries but all they had was this lame cucumber ranch...WHO MAKES CUCUMBER RANCH!!!! No one but them thats who! Want to know how easy ranch is? Mayo, buttermilk, garlic powder, onion powder, maybe some chopped up fennel fronds, bit of pepper, hey you have ranch! Easy, no cucumber needed, have some on deck for those that may want some freaking ranch, Their head chef needs to be fired, or whatever crackpot conned his way into being the corporate chef that makes all of the decisions for the restaurant. I got the chicken and waffles, the only saving grace was the sage fried chicken, it was delicious. The parts that I hated were....1. The mount Vesuvius portion of super soggy bacon waffles, which the bacon did nothing to help because it was equally as soggy. 2. The over fried leeks that I had to cough up several times. 3.  The ridiculously small amount of syrup they want to throw your way to soak up the mountain of gluten they expect you to choke down. 4. The unfiltered swamp water Las Vegas likes to claim as its own for their water choice. 5. The stupid stupid stupid, unnecessary grape tomatoes that grace the plate on the left and right side for no reason what so ever. 5. The eight inch sprig of insanely ridiculously, unnecessary rosemary that was jammed into my waffles....WHY????????????????????????? What was the point???????????????? Get it off of there, away from there. Its fresh rosemary, not cooked in anything, its just there. I took it out and threw it to the side. This place is awful. And I feel sorry for you and your palate if you actually like it. Its novelty, I would rather go to McDonalds ,and I HATE McDonalds, this this craptastic crapfest of an over thought, over priced establishment. We both hated it with a passion.",

Sometimes, their staff can take their sweet time but for the most part, are very courteous and offer decent suggestions.  Pricing is a bit expensive for the experience \"from farm to table\" so to speak, but the portions are huge and can easily be shared between two people.  If you haven't tried it yet, you should at least once, but I prefer going there for dinner versus breakfast due to large crowd/massive wait times in the a.m.",

If you like fancy plating and the novelty of being at such a popular restaurant, this place is for you.  - beware of men's bathroom. with the big portions you get, one can imagine... -____-",

The food portions are definitely gigantic! Any one of their plates can easily feed two people.  We ordered:  - brown sugar banana flapjack - mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach house hash - Andy's sage fried chicken benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit (appeared on Man vs. Food)  Everything was so savory and delicious! If this place was in the bay area, I would be here every Saturday morning, or more! I can't wait to eat at this place again the next time I'm in Vegas.  Prices are reasonable, but service kind of sucked...maybe it was just the waitress we had? I have to give them the benefit of the doubt because all the food we ordered was so tasty!  Deeeeeeelicious food, highly recommended!",

    "text": "Food was fine. Service was passable. I just have a problem with their policies. Maybe just one policy, actually. Prior to my trip to Las Vegas, I was excited to plan a meal at HH-a-GG. I was more excited to find a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> deal available. At our first opportunity, we made our way to the Hash House. Mid-afternoon, easy parking, no crowd...perfect! We went in and placed our orders, presenting the gift certificate at that time. Beverages were delivered and we were expecting our food when the waitress announced that they wouldn't honor our gift certificate because it was a holiday. Raise your hand if you have Columbus Day off. Thank you, Postal Workers! Now, it was a little late to mention this, but I let it pass. We were hungry!   The coupon thing riled me a bit, but later in the vacation, we made our way back HH-a-GG thinking to redeem that sucker after all. It seems our timing was off once again. In Las Vegas, there are no designated times for anything. Except maybe at this place. We'd just missed what they considered the lunch portion of the day, so we were only presented with the dinner menu. At least they were quick to point out that the fine print on the coupon said \"breakfast or lunch.\" I asked about the \"Late Breakfast\" section on the dinner menu. No Dice!  As I mentioned, the food was fine, so they get one of their two stars for that. The other is for having Arrogant Bastard Ale. I could easily have had a five-star experience here if not for their steadfast refusal to honor a freakin' ten dollar discount. Was it going to kill them? Is Columbus Day even a holiday in Nevada? It is not. School is in, state offices are open and Hash House a Go-Go is not that stinkin' busy. Next time I'm in town, I'm going to get another coupon, carefully check the dates and bus in 20 homeless people for coffee.",

Apparently, I've been searching for love in all the wrong places and it was hiding all along on Sahara Ave in Sin City.   The first thing you notice about hash house are the gigantic portions. Often associated with vegas, big food is kind of a staple in the city but it is not always of the highest quality. I think I ate a hot dog for a buck that is still wreaking havoc in me. However, hash house offers dishes with flavor even bigger than the portions. Their waffles are a God send as they are light and fluffy and stuffed with bacon. The fried chicken is moist and succulent on the inside and popping with crunch and flavor on the outside. Their meat loaf is better than any granny will make (just don't tell them that). And their pancakes can be mistaken for blankets they're so big!   Now with all that said, you'd think you would have to drop some serious coin on a breakfast or lunch this epic. That's where you're wrong! The food is so reasonably priced you almost feel guilty! Almost! For a massive meal that will keep you warm for days, you're probably looking at around 12-15 bucks. That's a bargain considering the quality and quantity of food you're getting. The hash house people are doing everything right except not having a location in LA for me to visit whenever i want.",

I've been to Hash House in San Diego and had such a great experience that I wanted to finally check it out here in Vegas.   What a disappointment :( I don't want to be the mean reviewer but my experience needs to be addressed. As we arrived, I was told its going to be a 30 min wait. OK fine. I understand given the fact that its Saturday morning and its a busy time for them. Got our table and order taken 15 mins later. Then, it seriously was over 30 mins and our food hasn't arrived yet?! Keep in mind, my daughter and I only ordered a a tractor combo (2 eggs, bacon, and a butterscotch almond pancake) & french toast for us to share! Given the patient and understanding person I am...I held my tongue. So what got me was when the people who sat around me started getting there food already! BUT we got there waaaaay before they did!!! what the?! I finally asked the server if our food was coming too?! He said yes, its coming out soon. *slaps forehead* If only he would of kept me updated if it was going to be awhile or not, instead of ignoring me.   The sad part was... after 15 mins into eating... the server handed us the bill!  WOW. REALLY!!? It took forever to wait to get seated, for the food to come out, and SO QUICKLY to rush us out!? No words to say. Customer service is terrible. I suggest not going to Hash House in the mornings on weekends, unless you have the time and patience to go through all of that especially in this summer heat.",

Only downsides are:  You may have to wait for quite a while if you go at peak times, the prices look a bit steep (though you get soo much food that it is worth it), and it is noisy.  Though all of those are not really downsides in my mind, I would still wait 45 if I happened to have a craving for a Snickers pancake on a Sunday morning! :D  Recommendations:  Watermelon kiwi lemonade, Snickers pancake, Meatloaf...  Everything I have tried so far has been amazing! :D",

The grilled cheese was large with Texas toast and lots of cheese. However, the tomato that was added to give a \"zing\" fell flat. The tomato was cooked too long. We all know what tomatoes do when they get really warm: they get mushy and watery. My grilled cheese was mushy.   My companion had steak and eggs. The steak was well when it was ordered to be medium. His hash browns were good, but a bit salty.  I have to say their farm house helping theme seems to be what makes other important culinary boo boos looked over by fans.

As I sat at the table exploring the menu nothing really popped out at me. I had more questions than anything because of the unfamiliar items. I asked the server what the popular items were and he mentioned the chicken and waffles and fried chicken benedict (I believe). He pointed the items out on nearby patrons plates and the portions were SO astronomically big that unfortunately they just didn't look appealing to me. I also notice the restaurant wastes a lot of food as the tables were being cleaned because the portions appear to be impossible to finish. Big portions = big waste.   I ordered a simple breakfast platter with country potatoes, scrambled eggs, chicken sausage, and biscuit. Everything was just okay for my taste buds. The biscuit was too dense/heavy for my liking. However, the homemade strawberry preserves was amazing and may have been the best part of my meal. The service was just okay as well. I don't recall our servers name but he didn't leave a memorable impact at all.   If you like big portions of country style comfort food this may be the place for you. I doubt I'd ever return unless I was going with a group or someone who hadn't been who insisted they wanted to try it out.",

I almost gave them a 5 just based on that BBQ sauce mixed with whatever its mixed with. Which bytheway they can cover everything in for you!  The eggs are good, the potatoes are good.  WAIT ONE SECOND SIR!!! what the the hell these potatoes are soft!! Yes thats because theyre mashed potatoes... holy mother of all that is mighty... what a simple yet genius idea. Throw everything on top of some mashed potatoes.   Bacon good. (ill be honest I didn't order here so I dont know what I ate) everything was good. A little high in price but very good food.

Want to forget about the girl/guy you got pregnant... go here and eat yourself to death (obviously a metaphor and not an actual suggestion). I swear Im pro family.

For breakfast I tried the basic breakfast which consisted of eggs, bacon, home style potatoes, a biscuit and fresh jelly and fruit! Everything was fresh and seasoned perfectly! At the second location for dinner (The Linq Hotel) I tried the BBLT which was awesome. I asked for avocado on my sandwich and I was given an entire avocado (LOVE)!! Hubby had the chicken and waffles for breakfast and pot pie for dinner which both dishes were fabulous! I haven't tried the location in Plano yet but I will definitely visit soon!",

    "text": "I had high expectations for his place... which is probably why I wasn't impressed with the food. I had the HH Quesadilla , it was ok ... it was flavorful but way to heavy. I noticed it (and. Many other plates on the menu) included mashed potatoes in place of hash browns . The mashed potatoes were good but they made a weird combination with the quesadilla (possibly what made the plate so heavy). The garnish was weird too... they decorated my mashed potatoes with what looked like burnt raw spaghetti noodles (didn't make sense) and a stalk of rosemary stabbed into the quesadilla (??) , the dish was also garnished with a piece of watermelon and a slice of orange ... it was weird but whatever I dig in and managed to finish half the quesadilla , it was too much.  I think that maybe for some people who enjoy a hearty heavy breakfast , this place is for you. The service .... not great the guy would half check on us , offer stuff and wouldn't come back... he seemed preoccupied with another table who's group was much larger than our party of 2.  3 stars because it wasn't a horrible dining experience it just wasn't the place for me.",

    "text": "\"GO GO\" TO HASH HOUSE, BUT \"NO NO\" DANCING -- I'm a bit embarrassed, but I want to provide in advance of you going, advice and a warning.  No need to dress up in your leotards, a tutu, and/or your dance shoes (not that I did that or anything, because I always wear my Capezio's when going for breakfast).  I just thought with the name, I'd go all out.  While dancing is not discouraged, it's also not a dance club (like I MAY have thought).  Instead, I partook of what they do offer here: GROSSLY HUGE food.    BREAKFAST -- You have to try their famous breakfast items: fried chicken & waffles (comes stacked high practically to the ceiling), the pancake (size of a Fiat), and lots of good egg/omelet choices (I like the chicken hash & eggs), and warm buttermilk biscuits with freshly-made jam.  Good Lord!  LUNCH/DINNER -- Meatloaf (be civil, it's a massive portion.  Eat half and be sure not make a spectacle of yourself.  Then, drive 2 blocks away to an empty parking lot and eat the other half in the car), the BBBLT (mmmmm lots of bacon, a whole pig worth), and their stuffed hamburger (1 pounder, impossible to eat the whole thing...again, head for the parking lot 2 blocks away).  SALADS/HEALTHY -- Huh?  Whatever.   SERVICE -- My favorite is Melina - whenever she was working, I'd always ask for her.  She's fun, and shows great customer service. Always terrific.  The hostesses are super sweet, and keep the waiting hungry customers moving as quick as possible.  The only way they could be nicer is if they offered small pieces of fried chicken to customers while waiting to be seated.   WAITING -- No reservations, so my recommendation is to be there early before 930am.  If you get there at 10am or later, be prepared to wait 20-45 mins.  Again, no fried chicken served while you wait.   Pffff!  PARKING -- Ample private lot, and since it is way off strip by a few miles -- you have elbow room on the streets, so no need to play bumper cars.  CONCLUSION -- It's AWESOME.  I love, I love, I love  I've returned many times, and you will, too.",

    "text": "2.5 stars. Came here on a Sunday afternoon. The place was packed and had to wait 10mins for a table. Not a bad start.    The waitress seemed a bit stressed (due to possible understaffing) and barely got a moment of her time. I had ordered the BLT bloody Mary, nothing too special and a bit spicy for my taste. The slice of bread that comes with it - awesome idea...but the toast was rock hard and if there were a few more slices of bacon to go with it, it'd have been perfect! I'd have even dunked it into my bloody Mary to make the perfect app. I know how crazy certain places can get with a good bloody mary.   I ordered the fried chicken Benedict, my friend ordered the salmon scramble(I think). She had feared, after ordering, that what she'd ordered wouldn't be what's expected. As soon as the food came(ca. 15mins later), it wasn't what she'd expected and sent it back. Around 5mins. Later, her replacement meal was served. The kitchen was definitely on top of their game that day! We were both impressed by the timing at that point.   I'll definitely be ordering something different next time - my benedict had WAY too much chipotle. The portions are gigantic, which is great if you actually pike your dish - you'll have plenty leftover.   I might add that I seriously loathe their fried spaghetti garnish.",

I had a large group of famished, sunday-after-vegas-weekend-exhausted friends. All of them more than ready to show hash's infamously large plates what was up. Okay well maybe that could've just been my thoughts, really.  I was fortunate enough to have an eating partner willing to partake in my fatty adventure. The original request of a not so detrimental eggs benedict had been replaced by the andy's sage fried chicken benedict and a chorizo hash. Mind you, two very gargantuan orders. What a good sport, I almost kind of felt bad. Almost.   Everyone got a variety of things which was of course, more food than anyone should ever force to digest in one sitting. We really enjoyed the sage fried chicken and chorizo orders --and were also the only two who finished all of our food.   Side note, the fried chicken in and of itself was a bit dry. Luckily there was enough fat off the bacon, and the fried cheese to keep it moist. LOL.   My friend got the kiwi watermelon drink thing which she seemed to have liked. No one else bothered with drinks.   Bellies full, albeit painfully. Back on the road for a very long comatose drive home.",

It's really just about the size of the portion I guess that gets everyone excited on Yelp, but seriously the food is only average.  And actually, this last visit the food was kind of only warm and not hot.   It's a fun place to go with friends and again the service and portion sizes can't be beat.

We ate here right before dropping off our rental car and our friendly server was really good about making sure we were out of there in good time.  Since it was Tuesday afternoon, there was no wait (and plenty of parking right out front), but we already knew we wanted to have Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The portion was enormous, bigger than your head (at least my head...). We shared an order with extra chipotle cream on the side. When our mountain of food arrived, we happily dug into a delicious combination of fried chicken, fresh spinach, bacon, tomato, mozzarella, spicy chipotle cream, scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes and a yummy fluffy biscuit until we could not eat another bite. I was stuffed for days!  While we were waiting for our food, we watched other people tackle towering plates of pancakes, waffles, fried chicken, Benedicts... Incredible if anyone could actually finish!   Great location and the prices are about a buck less than the location on The Strip.  Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Farm Benedict. Get it! It's good! Man v. Food. Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict likely will win 99% of the time. It beat us, and we shared! Are you up to the challenge???!?!",

I ordered the kids bacon waffle for only 5.95 and I the portion fed 2 kids. I had the chicken fried Benedict... Huge portion so filling, different,and amazing. They call it twisted farm food which fits perfectly! Service was great and prices I thought were crazy good for the amount of food!

    "text": "Visited on Sunday around noonish. Plenty of parking all around. Trendy modern farm sort of environment which is pretty cool. Lots of pics of famous people who ate there. Now the review. We were greeted and seated pretty fast. Was given a menu. I ordered the chicken pot pie, Mac n cheese, and another dish I that will mentioned later. Our food was jotted and processed. Took roughly about ten minutes more or less for our food to come out, one dish longer than the other. Their signature is putting a stick of rosemary on everything. Pretty nice touch. The Mac n cheese was good. Not overwhelming of a specific kind of cheese or lacking flavor of cheese. The chicken pot pie was not bad and ALOT, pretty impressive. However it need more soup, the bread to soup ratio was off which made the dish overall a bit dry. Lots of veggies which I like. Not enough chicken as I notice with every bite. Could use improvement. As for customer service, everyone was friendly and accommodating. Checked up on us. Even gave us a coupon for our next visit. Overall, chicken pot pie could use more chicken and soup. In addition, dishes were a bit pricey but then again it was our first time and not really from the area so once in a while it's good.",

Just poor service, bad table manners even if the food was decent  it is going to  be hard to want to come back.

    "text": "Actually Hash House should deserve four stars but I need to take out one star for the wait and service.    Our group of eight people came there on Sunday at 3:00pm.  The restaurant was quite empty that time and there wasn't even a line, but we still waited twenty-five minutes for a table.  After we seated, we waited another ten minutes for a waiter.  If the restaurant was busy, I would expect the slow service and long wait....but it wasn't!  Before we ordered, we all knew the enormous portion of the dish.  But since everyone was starving like crazy, we still ordered our own food.   I have ordered:  Grilled portobello mushroom - The portion of the sandwich was OK, not huge as other dish.  The sandwich had a big piece of mushroom with roasted red peppers, basil pesto, goat cheese on wheat bun .  The taste was ok...noting special.  I got the salad on the side with cucumber dressing,  It was decent salad.    I also got the kiwi watermelon lemonade.  I really like it, very refreshing.    My friend got the Fried Chicken and Waffles.  It was huge.  The chicken was a little bit dry but still good.  The waffle was a little soggy.    The food was on the pricey side but based on the portion, it was ok.  I highly recommend to share the dish with your friend...........",

I think it was a mistake on me not to have ordered the most famous item on the menu: The Man Vs Food one.   Yet, I read the reviews ahead of time and was persuaded by many yelpers that anything here tastes great. Wrong.   I ordered the Benedict, and to be completely honest, I felt like Ihop tasted way better. Ouch, it hurt me to even type that knowing that this place has such high ratings.   I sat all the way back in the secluded room- in the corner. Uhm, there was SO MUCH MORE room in the main dining room. I felt banished from eating with society.   Flagging down the waiter was the worst part. Since I sat where the kitchen was, or where I believed the kitchen was, waiters would only care about their own table. My waiter was no where to be found when I needed a KNIFE to eat my Benedict.   My waiter also recommended their house drink: something Watermelon. Honestly people, it is not worth your money.   My mindset to seeing the prices was: Hey I'm in Vegas. It's EDC weekend. I just want to live my youth. Money is less of my worries right now. But seriously, 5-6 bucks for a glass of watermelon juice... just no.   I was literally in and out in 20 minutes.",

The other place was good too, but we really want to try this place's food.   It was extremely busy here. People were waiting outside to get seated. Once we went inside, we noticed what the hype was all about.  All the food portions are huge.  Everything looked really good. Too bad we couldn't try the food since we were full.   We ended up going to the bar to grab a drink which took for ever. The waitress was really busy trying to keep up with all the orders. She at least acknowledge that we were waiting to be helped. We decided to have a Hash House Bloody Mary. They have a good selection of drinks. The Bloody Mary tasted really good. It was a bit spicy for my taste but I enjoyed.   I look forward to stopping by for lunch next time I am in town. The food all looked good!!! Hopefully, it taste good too!!!",

    "text": "On Performance Art:  For the holiday visit, my family indulged my curiosity about this innocuous brown building on our Sahara Avenue drive from house to Strip.    Walking in and seeing the stainless steel furniture, dark clad young staff and roadhouse ambiance, I had a Hard Rock experience that faded when I saw the dishes being brought to their diners.  Wasting no time, my brother ordered the Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin Benedict and my much less buff Mom and I split the Indiana favorite with Fried Chicken, Eggs, Biscuit and Bacon Mashed Potatoes with a side of ham.  Our waiter was pretty friendly / helpful and at one point gave us someone's extra strawberry lemonade.    I uploaded pics of what we ordered to further my point that this place clearly prospers on Presentation.  (Why else would this joint warrant over 1000 photos?)  The immense breaded pork tenderloin slathered with BBQ cream and scrambled eggs defies description.  Never mind that there is an entire serving of bacon mashed potatoes, spinach and a biscuit under that thing which effectively hides the plate.  Just looking at this dish makes your heart skip a beat.  Our chicken was much less impressive (but featured a jaunty rosemary sprig stuck in the center of the biscuit whose big brother accompanies the pork tenderloin) with some sliced tomatoes, a slice of watermelon and orange to counter the salty / sweet flavors of the chicken breast and spud-shaped mound of mashed potatoes / maple reduction.  As a side note, my brother nearly finished that pork platter.  I'm so proud!  Awe aside, the taste of all this food was good, but nothing as mind-mending as its appearance.  However, I can see this fare being a great sponge for an equally impressive hangover.  It's the ultimate greasy (sort of gourmet) spoon.",

I loved their Chicken and Waffles- everything is massive here, so it's large bacon waffles with crispy chicken on top- the chicken was perfectly crispy and moist.  I ordered their brown sugar and banana pancake- I thought it was WAY too sweet, and I could only eat two bites, but everyone at the table RAVED about it, they ate the entire thing for me and said it was their favorite thing here.  We also ordered their meatloaf sandwich- a nice piece of meatloaf  with a large crispy cheese slice on crispy fried bread- it was really good.  We also got their chicken pot pie which was a massive heap of chunky vegetables in a biscuit hat- pretty good, their massive burger with mac+cheese just seemed OK.",

I've been there a handful of times and food quality is always between 4-5 stars but isn't so perfect all the time. A lot of there menu items dont really stick out to me, so it's one of the reasons why i'm giving it a 4.  I'm also marking it down because the portions are just way too big for me and the rest of my family. I'm not a big fan of over-kill and this is a place that does it.

    "text": "This is my first 3 star review.  I feel all dirty inside.  So, let  me toss the pro and cons right at ya!!!  I've dined at Hash House many time's.  Mostly because I have lot's of friends who come to town for short visits and don't wanna go to a casino. It does have a nice atmosphere. ( for being a converted Chevy's....yes, it's a converted Chevy's)  One of the most consistent things is the cocktail's. I love me the gin and tonic!!! WHOOO!!!  Especially Bombay Sapphire and Tonic.  Every time I order one at the Hash House, it's perfect. So, Pro 1 is that they have a great bartender. Pro 2 it's got ATMOS.  Now for the crap fest.....at first appearance their giant plate with a branch of Rosemary ( I'm pretty sure it's Rosemary ) sticking right out of the top is AWESOME, however, for the most part a plate of bland potatoes.  Any restaurant that has a beautiful steak on the menu, then covers it in tasteless gravy and buries it in mushed potatoes....needs to go back to the drawing board.   I'm not sure where i read it, but a True test of an great restaurant is how they serve a steak.  Sad part is the beef was fantastic, cooked just the way i wanted it....but, covered in crap and under seasoned.  Booo!  In closing....they got personality.  And most people say a great breakfast menu too.  (GIANT PANCAKES, cute)  I've had breakfast there.....packed with people, had a salmon scramble....dry and way fishy, ick!  It was accompanied by a swell mimosa.....so they got the liquor part in spades.  Take a chance and feel their vibe, but when you choose what to eat, be really friggin picky!!!!",

    "text": "I have never heard of this place before and this was definitely an unexpected, but pleasant, surprise during our Vegas trip.  One of my cousins had talked us into trying out Hash House because she saw a feature of it on one of Rachel Ray's shows on Food Network.  Never ones to pass up an opportunity to try something new, my husband and I went with our group of 9.    Right off the bat, I knew we were going to experience something special when I saw the huge portions the servers were carrying out.  Think of the silver trays at Chipotle and imagine that it was turned into an oval shape and made of china instead of aluminum.  That's how big these were.  Our lunch companions were smart and decided to share betweens the couples but wanting to try different things, my husband and I decided to order separately.  I had the sage fried chicken eggs benedict which was the size of my entire head and my husband ordered their famous chicken and waffles.    Although the portions were huge, my eggs were cooked perfectly so I was assured that quality was not overlooked for quantity.  My husband's bacon waffles were amazing.  And when I say bacon waffles, I mean bacon that is inside the waffles which has got to win some sort of award for just existing!  I'm allergic to watermelon so I wasn't able to try the watermelon lemonades but everyone raved about theirs!  If I had remembered to bring along my EpiPen I would sipped some but I instead enjoyed a wonderful  pineapple champagne spritzer that was sweetly refreshing after our morning hiking around Hoover Dam in the desert heat.  Hash House is just the place to go when you're in the mood for a good and satisfying meal.  Just be ready for the cravings to set in once you leave Las Vegas like I've been having!",

The prices look high until you see the portions. Seriously, my plate was at least two feet across! If you can eat so much that you can't make two good meals out of your leftovers, I'm impressed. So realistically, as long as you aren't too haughty to hungrily dive into yesterday's remainders, you're getting a good value.    The service was good though the atmosphere was mediocre. I admit, it felt a little Cheesecake Factory to me, but I'm willing to overlook it. I'll eat there again, and would definitely recommend it for anyone in the area. Maybe not worth driving off the strip for, but close, so if you're nearby you should be sure to hit it up.",

It's the kind of breakfast that makes the world seem right again. If you're in Vegas you need to try this place.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it's SO hard to find. It might have been partly our fault since we decided to park in the Caesar's Palace parking lot...which is a completely different story...but the restaurant is inside the Imperial Palace casino so you have to find your way through the maze that is a Vegas casino in order to get there.",

    "text": "I have been told to go to Hash House a Go Go since I moved out to Vegas 7 years ago.  I was excited when my boyfriend finally set a date for us to go.  We went last Sunday morning, and after reading the reviews I was prepared for the wait.  If you aren't expecting to be waiting for 45 minutes, then I can understand being upset, but expecting the wait made it ok.  The place is a complete zoo!!  They honestly need to expand the restaurant or at least the waiting area.  We waited in the car because almost everywhere you stand is in somebody's way!  The restaurant is also pretty loud due to the amount of people in there.  I really like the decor as well, it's kind of country meets modern?  And the music was awesome, very original and fit the restaurant perfectly.   There is a reason for the busyness here -- the food here is great and extremely reasonable considering the portions are HUGE!! I'm talking 2 meals... I took mine home and had it for dinner! I ordered The Tractor Driver Combo.  It was delicious!! The pancake that they delivered was insane... I would say it took as much batter as 6 regular sized pancakes to make that thing!  I was a little upset with myself for going with such a basic breakfast menu item at a restaurant like that, but I don't care... that pancake was amazing.  Plus I got to share with my boyfriend who ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  I honestly don't like chicken for breakfast, I think it's odd, but it was good... There were so many different flavors in every single bite.  It's almost impossible to get them all in 1 bite because the plate is SO big!   DRINKS  : MUST TRY THE BLOODY MARY!!! I am NOT a huge bloody mary fan, I normally have a few sips and then give it away because I don't like tomato juice... but a friend of mine told me i HAD to try it!! So I did and DID NOT regret it one bit.  I wanted 5 more when I was done for the flavor alone.  It was really spicy and the garnishes are deliciouss. I have been craving it ever since.  My boyfriend ordered the watermelon kiwi lemonade (I think that's what it was called) and WOW that thing is delicious and so pretty!!  All the drinks they were making at the bar (alcoholic and non alcoholic) looked wonderful. I am really looking forward to going back and trying different things!! I have to try the banana latte next time I'm there... It sounds unreal!   GO HERE!!!!!!!",

It includes griddled mozzarella cheese (literally.. just melted and browned on the griddle), scrambled eggs, sauce, bacon, biscuit, mashed potatos, and the juicy fried chicken. Now normally I'm not a big fan of chicken breast, but this one is JUICY JUICY and YUMMY YUMMY GET IN MY BELLY.  I don't know what it was that made me love this so much. Presentation was excellent, flavors were all there, portion size was very good.  I ate this for lunch, brought it back home for the next day's lunch AND dinner. And it was just as good the next day.  Hubby ordered chicken and waffles. BACON COOKED INSIDE THE WAFFLE. Genius.

    "text": "i had big eyes here. and... if you have big eyes here, PLEASE ONLY GET ONE PLATE. one plate is enough to feed 4 people comfortably.  I got the sage fried chicken benedict. and the bacon waffle. (i shared the bacon waffle with 3 others). but we didn't even finish our dishes. everyone took something home.   sage fried chicken benedict. i was eyeing so many items on the menu, but this was my final decision since it said man v food favorite next to it. it was delicious, and i definitely took at least half of it home. the chicken was crispy and delicious. the sauce on top is really good. i don't know what it was. the mashed potatoes are really good, and the biscuit is very fluffy. as soon as the waitress plopped it in front of me, i knew i couldn't possibly finish it. i had the leftovers later, and it was still good!  bacon waffles. i actually really really really enjoyed this. maybe more than the sage fried chicken benedict. only because it's simple: savory and sweet. BTW, the bacon at this place is amazing. thick and crispy. i'll definitely want to get this again, but i'm going to have to give a chance to other items on the menu.  when we arrived, it was a sunday around noon i'd say. they told us it was an hour and 15 minute wait. we decided to wait it out. we ended up getting seated 30-40 minutes in. so it wasn't bad. but we were extremely hungry, and that explains why we all got the bacon waffle as an \"appetizer\" to share. we definitely did not need it.   this location is off the strip.. quite the ways.. there's another one at imperial palace so i've heard.",

    "text": "SERVICE IS A MUST!   Immediately, my expectations were high thanks to Man v. Perhaps too high. After arriving with a party of 7, me and the crew realized that we should have sat separately as it took nearly 15 minutes for someone to happen by and take our drink order. One of the members of our group was unsure of his order so we asked the server to take the rest of them and put them in. She took the orders and never placed them instead she waited another 15 minutes and finally took my friends order and placed it with ours. After the third trip to the table it was impossible to find he again. We confronted the manager and he said he would take care of it. Which apparently meant she was going to complain to us about our issues with her services. She finally came back to the table and said \"So, you told my manager your not happy with my services?\" awkward...and yes that is what she said. No apology, no attempt to make it better, no refills and the service got worse. Service is a BIG part of going out for me. The food can be terrible but if the service is great I just may go back. If you have the BEST food in the world and the service is lousy I will not go back. As for this place I will NOT be going back!   As for the food... well, it was okay but it was hard to get past the server. Give it a shot and hopefully, your experience with the staff is more pleasant.",

These people hustle they were non stop the whole time we were there 3) the food!!  Omg where to start, huge portions and once again delicious and different.  The French toast is unreal, banana batter dipped bread topped with candied pecans and syrup, unreal.  Their signature chicken and waffles, so fabulous, crisp lightly battered chicken on a mountain of waffles with bacon inside! This became breakfast and dinner for me.

My mom and I split the sun-dried tomato scramble and my dad got eggs and bacon.  The food was average. The potatoes were plain and had very little flavor.   The problem with this place was the service.  We saw our server a total of 4 times.  Once to take the drink order, food order, check on us after we were almost done, and to present the bill.  Our water glasses were empty the whole meal.  It wasn't till the end my mom had to flag someone else down to refill them.  I had only one cup of coffee since no one ever refilled it.  Our server passed are table several times without even checking on us.  Several times, we saw him chatting away with his coworkers in front of us.  He spent more time talking to them than to us.

Things are great when the twists are not too wicked (like the fairly straightforward chicken and waffles). However, some of their dishes are just a sin (salmon fried with a cornmeal crust was just a gross way to treat a fish). Service can be spotty - sometimes you feel they just fawn over you, other times it can like pulling teeth to get a glass of water. And is no one else annoyed by the odd fried vermicelli and sprigs of rosemary?   As far as portions go, you'd be hard pressed to find larger portions in Vegas. But, I'd rather have a normal amount of great food over a huge amount of passable fare. There are so many other great places to eat in Vegas, I don't think I'll be venturing here again anytime soon.",

AND she also ordered the granola waffle.  that did not stop her from eating part of my breakfast.  she was gonna order the bacon waffle but since she saw my breakfast came with it, she decided to do the granola waffle and just help herself to my bacon waffle.  fed wife = happy wife.  everything we had at hashouse was good. the portions were huge tho so you gotta come hungry.  we ended up taking home part of her granola waffle which she did eat later on in the day.  yes, according to her, it still tastes good hours later.",

It slips my mind what we had but the atmosphere is lovely and lively! The portions are huge and I mean HUGE. It was really cheap for the amount of food we received so if your ever in the area, you MUST give it a try!  I did dock a star for the poor service since the table next to us came later, got their food and check earlier with a smile. Maybe it's because we looked like cheap little teenagers? I THINK NOT. It was quite rude that we weren't even visited once for a follow up and another guy had to bring us our waters and boxes. It honestly was NOT that busy, boo!",

    "text": "Well, 5 stars if quantity is all you care about.  But, for me, it makes me feel queasy.  But, maybe this is what America is all about - stuff your face so your bottom can't even fit into the booths anymore.  The plates are massive here.  But, it'd be more appropriate to serve it in troughs and have the tables raised up so you don't have to move your arms or head as much.  Is it impressive to slop on a massive amount of food and call that your specialty?  Maybe, if you're the kind of person that is disappointed by an all you can eat because they don't have enough food for you.  I had the tractor breakfast.  2 eggs?  Maybe ostrich eggs.  And \"a\" flapjack, which was the size of a pizza.  I have 2 stars simply because I was impressed that they managed to cook the whole thing, and because it did actually taste alright.  I threw up a little bit in my mouth while having to recount this episode of my life, but I hope it was worth it, so that you could avoid going here, so that you don't have to live through having more slop placed in front of you and that that 70% won't be thrown into the compost.",

First time there I ate the Andy's sage fried chicken-chicken was tender and delicious and again the portion...HUGE!  The second time going there i tried the smoked salmon benedict -lightly smoked salmon over house mashed potatoes, homemade biscuits and a creamy sauce, again delicious and HUGE.  Couple of my friends also tried the pork tenderloin benedict and Andy's fried chicken and waffles; i was a able to try both and they were great.

    "text": "I'm sure HH-a-go-go is capable of delivering a positive experience in both the food and service categories. Unfortunately, when my girlfriend and I had breakfast there over MLK weekend, they failed on both counts.  We waited 20 minutes to be sat, as it was busy. No problem, I don't mind a wait. We were sat pleasantly enoughh, but that's it as far as the positives.   Our server was overwhelmed, and we weren't even acknowledged for quite some time. When we were finally acknowledged, the server looked completely frazled. Also, our table was missing a place-setting and had not been wiped down fully. All this stuff is understandable from time-to-time, and I wouldn't even mention it if not for the fact that the whole experience was subpar. One or two small items, no problem, but everything going poorly? Not good.  I ordered the chicken and asparagus hash with eggs, and my girlfriend ordered the fried chicken and waffles. We didn't receive our food for at least 30 minutes, and when it came out, only mine came. The server said: \"We're going to start you with the chicken and asparagus hash,\" like it was an appetizer or something. Funny.  After at least five minutes and my girlfriend's food having not arrived, I tried to find our waiter, but he was nowhere to be found. I flagged down another waiter and asked to see a manager. He arrived a couple minutes later and I asked him where my girlfriend's order might be, and he assured me it would be right out. Several minutes later, my girlfriend's fried chicken and waffles arrived.  The food: The coating was delicious, as was the maple syrup reduction. The chicken was very, very dry, however, and the waffles were soggy. My dish lacked seasoning and was actually quite bland. I also asked for it to come with mozarella, and they forgot that.  All in all, not a very pleasant dining experience at all. We will not be back.",

After hearing how huge the portion sizes are we all opted to share plates.  There is a split plate charge, but if each person sharing orders some sort of plate or side the charge is waived.  So, 3 of us shared a chicken & waffles and the pork benedict, to prevent the charge we ordered a side of bacon.  The rest of the table ordered the chicken benedict, a scramble, sausage and a waffle.    The food was okay, the portion sizes really were gigantic.  I wish the benedicts had a poached egg on them instead of the small amount of scrambled eggs.  The waffles had big bacon pieces sticking out of them, that was a nice touch.    Unfortunately a lot of us found ourselves running to the bathroom multiple times later that day.  So if you end up coming here, perhaps you should consider ordering something that isn't super greasy and fried...",

There's a split fee of $2.50 but you can avoid that by just ordering a side.  We ordered two sides of bacon.   Side of bacon: Yum!  You can't go wrong with bacon.  Blueberry pecan flapjack: You only get one but it's huge!  I'm not a pancake person but it was oh so fluffy and it had lots of goodies in it.  The syrup is light and perfectly sweet.  I think this was the highlight of the meal.  Smoked Salmon Scramble: This is very unique.  I've never had a scramble with brie and pesto before.  The smoked salmon itself was a bit lacking for me.  I wanted to taste it more but the smokiness just wasn't all there.  The potatoes were amazing though!  They were nice and crunchy and perfectly fried and tender throughout.  I didn't really eat the biscuit.  I was too much filling for me.  Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Farm Benedict: It was not bad but too overwhelming for me.  I can share this with a few people but will never order this by myself.  This chicken was fried really nicely but I found it to be a bit dry.  Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict Indiana Favorites: I'm not sure why we ordered two fried chicken benedicts!  This one was just as overwhelming as the other and the chicken was also a bit dry.  However, I really really liked the maple syrup on this one.  It goes so well with the chicken.    I think my boyfriend would absolutely love this place.  The portion size is right up his alley.

Now admittedly the walk through the hotel to get there was a bit seedy, but it was worth it for the huge portions and great prices.  When we arrived around 11am, there was a 30 minute line, which was fine for me since I assume a line means good food. After being seated, I ordered the bacon and mashed potato burger. First off, mashed potato in a burger? Hell yeah America! Secondly, this thing was huge! Weighing in over a pound, I thought it was going to take a bite out of me at one point.  I also ordered their classic Bloody Mary. Now I'm a bit persnickety when it comes to my bloody mary's, but this one was perfect and had the right blend of spicy and salty without being too strong.

As in, you NEED to split something with someone else, or be prepared to take half of your entree home. Everyone raves about the chicken and waffles, and while it is an impressive spectacle, I found both the chicken and the waffles to be terribly bland. One dish I keep coming back to is the sun dried tomato , goat cheese and basil omelette with crispy potatoes. This thing is full of flavor and tastes ridiculously fresh. The biscuits here are out of this world; you have to try it with the house-made strawberry jam and honey butter! I've also had the chicken biscuit benedict, and it's definitely my second favorite meal at this place. The husband ALWAYS orders the sage fried chicken, and it is ALWAYS delicious! Flavorful, juicy, and you'll have a second portion to take home and enjoy the next day.  Friends I have taken to this establishment always leave disappointed if they order a salad or a sandwich, so, be warned....",

She was great! she was extremely helpful & patient while helping the Mrs. sort through the choices at hand. I got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and the Mrs. got the Cobb salad. YES the portions are out of control!!! We wanted a good sampling to gage wether we would be back or not... The Salad was good, not great maybe it was because we didn't have them mix the Blu cheese dressing into the salad like normal or maybe it was because they didn't really have a salad dressing we liked....Personal preference right? right!...(Thats where we lost the 5th star)...  Moving on to the Benedict...it was huge!!! it was tasty! The combination of the flavors in the guts of the meal were great!! cheese, eggs, bacon, spinach, tomatoes etc topped with a hot chipotle sauce....mildly spicy...I was all over this thing!!! Yes i was hoping that there was more of a punch in flavor, meaning the flavor of the parts were good but subtle. I was hoping the sum of the parts would be greater than the whole but that wasn't the case. The Chipotle sauce pretty much made the dish. So much so that I ordered more the smother the mountain of breakfast goodies in. the presentation was great! The food was very good. The 4 star rating system here says: \"I'm a fan\" that I am because the other items on the menu are calling for a repeat visit.   This lady ordered a \"Stuffed cheeseburger\" the next table over that made me almost go over and sit at her table!!!! that thing looked so good!!  Till next time.",

Once again..out of pistachio. This wasn't even like late at night. This was at 12pm.  Portions here are out of this world. 5 girls shared 3 dishes and we still couldn't finish it all. We even saw a table of all boys struggling with their individual dishes. YEAH! They are that big!  This place may be known for their fried chicken & bacon stuffed waffles...but aside from looks failed to wow me. I found the chicken meat too dry and the skin too sweet. But that's just me.  What I do recommend is the chorizo hash. SOOO delicious and spicy!  Next time you are in Vegas and had a long night of partying&drinking....eat your heart out at Hash House!",

They serve the food in over sized plates and stack the meat on top of the French toast and people seem to think they are getting something worthwhile. Its beyond lame. My friend ordered a \"sirloin\" and when it arrived it was about 1/4 cup of meat and the rest cheese and undercooked potatoes. The pancakes were tough and the wait was insane. $46.00 for breakfast food, long waits and a broken bathroom. Sticking a twig of rosemary on the food does not make it gourmet, just goofy. Maybe if you have never had really good \"farm\" food, you will enjoy. Otherwise, do NOT believe the hype. Its bizzaro world in this place.",

Hash House A-Go-Go is a ways away from the strip so I recommend taking a car there. The wait time was considerably long. Two hours to get an inside table, or we had the option to gamble for a table outside or at the bar for less wait time. We ended up getting seated after a 45 minute wait outside in the sweltering heat, though it was manageable under a partial umbrella.  I ordered Andy's sage-fried chicken benedict which was the dish featured on MVF. After a bit the waitress finally brought out two flying saucers on a plate with a massive heap of lava flowing over it and a sage pine tree sticking out of the top with a sword (reminiscent of the Sword and the Stone).  There were two huge succulent pieces of spiced fried chicken atop a mountain of scrambled egg, potatoes, Smokey bacon, fresh spinach, mozzarella, on a split biscuit all swimming in a pool of chipotle cream.  This is a meal for 4. It was soooooooooo delicious. I will have to come back and try some more of Andy's food, because that was one of the tastiest breakfasts I've ever had.",

    "text": "You have to ask yourself sometimes, how crappy do I want to feel after I eat this? If the answer is - not at all, do NOT eat here. While in Vegas I wanted to sample some non-strip fair and drunkenly asked a bouncer where he liked to go eat - he said Hash House A Go Go. Given that he was about 6'5\" and weighed 250 pounds, it all makes sense now. My girlfriends and I arrived around 11:00am on Sunday morning and were told it was about to be about a 40 minute wait. That wasn't too bad - the line seemed to be moving quickly and there were some benches outside where you can sit and take a look at the menu. We were called inside to eat and the overall ambiance is pretty neat. Like a tin shed that is crossed with a barn? I decided to really go for full sickness feeling and order the fried chicken benedict (with their famous sage fried chicken). I have to say that I don't eat fried chicken often - in fact it has probably been about 10 years since I last had some, but sometimes you have to make your stomach beg for mercy. The portion that I received could have easily fed me for 2 weeks and I am not a light eater. It probably weighed 20 pounds. It has fried chicken, mashed potatoes, eggs, bacon, hollandaise and who knows what else since you could not see the bottom of the plate. Despite the gargantuan portion, the taste was excellent. Truly just tasty, greasy, cheesy diner food that does not apologize for using 3 pounds of butter in each dish. The service was fast and the coffee was great! Really, what else can you really ask for from a diner? The only reason that I am not giving 5 stars is that the portions are really (embarrassingly if not annoyingly) large. There is no reason anyone should need to eat that much food (now if you want to eat it, that's another story). But if you're looking to lay around for the remainder of the day in a food coma while wearing stretchy pants - then make sure you eat at Hash House!",

I have never been but have seen all the hype on the food network, so ... we went. We already know that the portions are ridiculously huge... so what else can I tell you? The food is amazing ! I got the pork loin- It came with mashed potatoes- spinach- carmelized onions- roasted pepper- and some kind of cheese and a horseradishy sauce.  I was a little worried that I would not like it...  I was wrong .  Now mind you I could only eat about a 1/4 of it. But what I ate was delicious. Perfectly mixed flavors to create a unique but amazing dining experience. My friend got the roasted butternut squash stuffed with risotto.  We shared a little with each other.   I couldn't decide which one I liked better, but I was not sorry with what I got.  I got an ice tea to drink, but was not impressed as it had a smokey flavor and I really would like my tea to taste like tea. I also was NOT impressed with our server, It could be that she was having a bad day? Or she does not like being a server- she was kind of non existant.  I told her I needed to place an order to go, and she looked surprised that I needed a menu...  um ok?  Then she waited til the end of our meal to put in the order - which we had to wait longer to leave.  That was the only bad part.  Our bus-boy was great and it was fun to watch him lift our heavy plates.  I will definitely go again... it is just a matter of time...",

The prices are very reasonable for such mountainous portions. I am nervous to return now learning about this insanity. We came on a whim and we will be returning. Our server was absolutely sweet and very attentive to our needs. I have heard some complaints about the place from friends after telling them where we had lunch, however we didn't have any problems. My burger was juicy and well cooked. The mushrooms and swiss did not disappoint. The bun was quite soft and fluffy. I am commenting on the bun because I usually toss those to the side as I devour the real meal. A lot of place's buns can be quite dry or plain. I can't wait to return and hopefully be blown away again! I will definitely be splitting my plate with a friend next time!",

I also couldn't decide how to tackle it. It was a really tall stack of waffles and chicken. I ordered a child sized pancake for my toddler, and it was the size of a small table. The portions are huge and I feel like its a waste of food. Also, I hated the atmosphere. The music was so loud that I couldn't talk to my family members that I had gone out to breakfast with unless I was yelling, and then they had to yell back. The service was pretty slow too, and not the greatest. Finally, the food that didn't live up to the hype was overpriced.

I've gone a few times and I must say, my first impression was the best impression. The Fried Chicken Benedict and French Toast were super tasty, impressively plated, and epically portioned. There is a very vast and creative drink selection for coffees and non-alcoholic thirst quenchers. I was slightly disappointed with the Fried Chicken and Waffles. Even though 95% of society loves bacon and are under the impression it makes everything better, I thought having the bacon INSIDE the waffles was superfluous and totally took away some key factors that makes bacon so great. The waffle iron must be what made the bacon rubbery and tasteless, which in turn, kinda ruined the waffle, which was chewy and meh. Other dishes I have had were filling and hit the spot, but weren't really anything to write home about. The staff, atmosphere, random but good music, and creative options make up for any entree which may be less than \"super fucking awesome\".",

Sure it was HUGE and it was filling, but as far as the tastebuds go, they weren't dancing...more like bobbing to the beat..no, not even that.  Sorry! I ordered the veggie house hash (was that my mistake?) and dude ordered the bacon waffle and eggs.  It was okay, but, again, we've both had much better breakfasts. Luckily, we didn't have to wait long since it was late morning on a Tuesday.  Service was good.  I guess my only complaint is that if it wasn't for DDD, there wouldn't be that much Hash House Hype.",
