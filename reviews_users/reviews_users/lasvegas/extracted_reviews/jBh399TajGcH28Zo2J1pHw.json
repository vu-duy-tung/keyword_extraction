    "text": "Pretty awesome place.  Although it's True that the burgers are too small, they really are de-lish ! Seasoned perfectly and on a soft but not mushy bun...these burgers hit the spot. I see some people complaining about the price but maybe they were ordering the double burger.  I don't get the whole infatuation with the cheese fries tho which were around $4.  To me, the plain fries are pretty much perfect by themselves and a good sized portion.     Very friendly staff & a clean, roomy restaurant and a little more upscale than a typical fast food place.  The music is a little loud but maybe  the young people dig that.  Definitely recommend !     I went again on Jan 14 to try the new chicken sandwich. It's pretty good - seems to be deep fried, kinda on the heavy side... I'm guessing the calorie count is pretty high. Still love this place",

The menu seemed overwhelming at first but I just ordered a simple single stack burger. I'm not a fancy burger person so I don't like all these crazy toppings on my burger. I like good meat and a solid bun along with tomatoes and lettuce.   The staff seemed very efficient and they have a good system when it came to refills. They have a lot of drink options. They also came around and checked on us made sure everything was ok. I saw them constantly wiping the communal areas and continuously restocking.   The food itself was just ok to me. The burger was good but nothing amazing. Their buns were delicious though. The fries i don't know what it is about crinkle cut fries but I do not like them. They recommended the cheese fries and it didn't do anything for me. I actually wished i got regular fries in stead. I probably will give this another try.",

But they're so famous I was willing to stand in line for an hour in New York City to try it and then again when one opened on the Vegas strip. Now, no line at Downtown Summerlin for the best burger in my humble opinion (yes even better than In n Out, Five Guys, Smash and FatBurger)...and you pay for that extra dose of gourmet but it's worth every meaty bite  And now they have a chicken sandwich that was so good it will now substitute Chick-fil-A for me until one opens in Vegas. And I'm obsessed with Chick-fil-A. But on second thought it's all the way in Henderson so I may just convert to Shake Shack chicken. The crew at this location were nice and didn't judge me when I had a beer for lunch, cause why not, I work in morning radio, noon is my happy hour.",

    "text": "So I kind of get it. I am an In-N-Out girl, but I can see the hype around shake shack. The regular burger is definitely not comparable to In-N-Out, but they do have a pretty delicious chicken burger and their frozen concrete is something I crave from time to time. The restaurant is in a great location, Downtown Summerlin, somewhere I shop at often so it's convenient for me.  The chicken burger is delicious as well as the concrete. The strawberry lemonade is refreshing and not too sweet. I also tried the fried tomato, vegetarian burger and I was sick of it after two bites. It had way too much cheese in it that it was overwhelming. The regular BLT is okay, I would prefer in-n-out over theirs any day. The cheese fries are probably my favorite thing on the menu. For the dog menu, my dog definitely gives their poochi-ini a thumbs up (if he had thumbs).  All together I would give Shake Shack 4 stars at most. However, this 5 star review is really for one of the managers at Shake Shack. I was shopping alone with my dog and the restaurant doesn't allow dogs inside. I couldn't leave my dog outside so the manager, Daniel, kindly came outside to take my order and brought it out for me. He was very kind and went above and beyond to bring out a water bowl for my dog as well. Although this is not something they do often and because it wasn't a very busy evening, Daniel did me this tremendous favor because I was really craving for a frozen custard as well as my dog (it was 100 degrees Fahrenheit that day). I thought it was something very considerate and I appreciate it beyond belief; for that I give this place five stars.",

The bill totaled 43.71 for the following order:  2 - Shack Stack Burger - Good burger, but pretty small for the price.  1 - Chicken sandwich - Pretty good chicken sandwich. I like the pepper taste in the batter. Again, small for the price.  1 - Chicago Dog - I guess it is good if you like Chicago style dogs. I don't care for all of the toppings.  1 - Chicken Dog - the chicken apple sausage dog was good, but I should not have told them to top it like the Chicago dog.  1 - Crinkle Fries - good fries.  I like the fact that the chicken served here is free range and all of the meat is natural (No hormones and no anti-biotics). I would recommend trying this place. The burgers and the chicken are worth coming back for. No more Chicago hot dogs for me.",

    "text": "I wish I had gotten the chicken sandwich because I had heard good things about it, but I went with a burger, I wanted to give it a try. Meh...it was just meh. Super small as well, especially for the price. I don't like crinkle cut fries so we skipped those and got a chocolate shake which was also very small and very average. The service was great and the set up of the restaurant is modern and clean. I like you can grab a cup of water if you need one. So we came with our dog, it was nice day for winter but the entire patio is in the shade so I was freezing the entire time, they have heaters out there but they weren't on, my husband tried to turn on a few of them but none of them had gas, so we ate quick. We did get our dog a Pup-tini (cup of vanilla ice cream, pb, and a dog treat)..which he absolute loved, so that was worth the trip. I'll try them again but next time...chicken and ice cream!",

    "text": "My first trip to NYC was magical. It was foodie heaven. One of my most favorite meals was at Shake Shack in Madison Square Park. Now it's here in Vegas and off the strip! How awesome is that?!  Mushroom lovers, the shack stack is a must try! It is a breaded portobello mushroom with warm melted cheese in a cheeseburger. Warning: it's a lot of cheese, but in a good way of you really like cheese. Negatives: the priciest of all the burgers. Some people can't justify paying that much, but for me it was well worth it to relive that original Shake Shack experience. Plus it saves me a plane ticket.   Vegetarians, the 'shroom burger is a great choice also. Basically, the same as mentioned above minus the beef patty. Love this option on my non-meat days.   Do you like a little heat and a little sweet? Bacon? I think I have your attention now. I highly recommend the the SmokeShack, which has chopped cherry peppers and applewood smoked bacon. It's so tasty! Definitely, a man's burger. My husband gets this every time! Also, available as a double (patty).   Truthfully, you might be disappointed with the ShackBurger. It was not bad at all, just not memorable. I would rather spend a little more for the ShackStack or the SmokeShack.   The crinkle cut fries here are okay, but I recommend the cheese fries over plain fries. The cheese adds some extra oomph in the flavor department.   What I love about Shake Shack is the quality ingredients. Although, burgers are on the small side it doesn't bother me. I'm full after one burger and sharing fries.  Pricy overall, but it's a nice splurge. Honestly, Shake Shack is not really comparable to other burger joints out there.   With desserts and cold treats nearby, I usually skip the shakes and concretes. I've sampled some before and they were delicious and extremely smooth. Look out for limited edition flavors that rotate weekly / seasonal!  *****Yelp 2016 100 review challenge***** 7/100",

And aside from the shake, the food wasn't good at all. The hot dogs are tiny and taste about as good as grocery store microwavable dogs. The cheese fries were just a handful of crinkle cut fries, aka frozen, with some nacho cheese on top...expected more from a place with this much hype  If you come here, I'd only recommend getting a shake and not any of their food. It's not good at all and you'd just be wasting your money. Definitely overrated. For much better hot dogs for a fraction of the price, you might as well go to Costco across the street",

The red velvet concrete comes with cake from Gimme Some Sugar, a bakery that I adore.  Being the one of two Vegas locations, this restaurant gets pretty busy. However, the couple of times that I've been here, I haven't waited for my food for over 10-15 minutes. There has also always been opened seating, unlike New York where getting a seat is like participating in Hunger Games.",

Nothing exceptional. Leaning on the table and wall while taking my order.  Menu on the wall was easy to understand. I ordered double shackburger,  3 fries, a regular shackburger, chocolate shake, and cookies and cream shake for to go. Total came out to $36.62 (tax included). Quite expensive so I was expecting awesome food. Wait time was average. About 15mins. So when the food came out, the chocolate shake caught my attention. For $5.29, it was in a small cup not even filles up to the top. Big gap from the lid. The cookies and cream was acceptable for the price of $5.79. It was in a bigger cup and with a dome lid. Shakes should be all in standard sizes for the price. I gave 2 stars for the taste of the burger coz my son said it was good. Nothing special with the fries and shakes.",

    "text": "Hopefully it wasn't just because I was starving after my hike, but I liked this location a lot more than the location at the NYNY. We arrived around 1:00 on Saturday afternoon and found a small line which was a nice surprise. Our food only took about five minutes to be prepared.  This location has a large indoor dining room as well as a large area outside. I was impressed with how much seating they had. Even on a Saturday afternoon it was easy to get a table outside.   I had the Chick'n Shack since I've heard so much hype over it. I really liked the crispy texture of the fried chicken, the herb mayo, and that there was a lot of lettuce for a fast food sandwich. Great sandwich, but I think burgers are probably still the best option here. The crinkle fries were nice and crispy with the perfect amount of salt. I also enjoyed a 50/50 of iced tea and lemonade that really hit the spot.   My husband enjoyed a double Shackburger. He did note that a double was necessary because the single would not have been filling enough. He also appreciated that they were able to prepare a burger without accidently putting cheese on it like most burger places. His hatred for American cheese is intense. The peanut butter shake was yummy as well.  Another pleasant surprise here was that they post the calorie counts of menu items on the large display menu. Awesome! I visited on my diet splurge day, but now I have another spot that I can visit on calorie counting days. For fast food their calorie counts are not that bad either.",

Very clean and nice atmosphere inside; too nice for a Habit and not quite a BJs. Lots of TV screens showing Nickelodeon and ESPN. The menu was plastered up against the wall. Lots and lots of options for those of you looking to be adventurous. Burgers, hot dogs, and shakes/custards, etc. I liked that they had beer on the menu.   Made it a simple lunch, cheeseburger and fries smothered in cheese. Wife had cheeseburger and fries. Kids went with hot dogs and fries. Here's a tip for you just do one order of fries for two or three to share. By the way they are crinkle cut fries. I was not that impressed with the burger. It was good but not great. It was very puny as well. Reminded me of a white castle burger. The bread was really good. I had a few bites of the cheese fries and they were good. My kids were not impressed. They barely touched their hot dogs and fries. I enjoyed the beer and the atmosphere. I am probably a bit bias for in n out and the habit.   Overall, I thought it was a bit overpriced for what it was. I may try again bit maybe go for a dessert. The staff was really great. Every staff member was courteous and greeted all the patrons with a smile.   To each his own. I'm not completely sold on the shake shack yet. Give it a try. Happy eating!",

If only it was 1/4 bigger in size and came with fries and a drink, I would think it's so worth it for $9.   I enjoyed the shack burger, but their price point still really bothers me as I see them as a fastfood chain, and not a sit-down restaurant. The crinkle fries are whatever in my opinion.   The smoke shack (that comes with bacon and some spice) is good. It was overly salty for my taste buds,and I'd stick to the regular shack burger if I were to return. Maybe if it was someone's treat I'd continue to come back, but I still feel the same way about giving my business to In n Out when the quality is equal to me and price point is way more awesome at the other. Plus, you can't beat fresh fries.",

    "text": "Many folks compare Shake Shack to In N Out but I would compare Shake Shack to Five Guys instead because the menu options for their burgers are similar.   FOOD/PRICES: You can choose from a variety of burgers (bacon, mushrooms, and cherry peppers), chicken sandwiches, hot dogs, crinkle fries, shakes made from custard, and beer and soft drinks. Prices range from $3-10 and because there are no combos, your bill may end up being pricier than expected.   QUALITY: The food is made to order and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. The strawberry shake was tasty and the chocolate shake was too chocolate-y. Not a fan of how thick the shakes were though. French fries were whatevs in my opinion. Hoping to try the cheese fries next time.   CUSTOMER SERVICE: The cashier was friendly and somewhat helpful with the menu. Nothing super great and nothing bad.   ENVIRONMENT: More restaurant type feel than fast food.   Overall, I would not come to Shake Shack if I wanted \"just\" a burger. I'd go to In N Out first - better prices and great quality too. Shake Shack would be more of a special treat due to the prices.",

    "text": "My first experience with Shake Shack was very shortly after this location in Downtown Summerlin opened in October 2015.  I've been back quite a few times since, and see no reason why I won't continue to frequent this place for its tasty burgers and desserts.  The restaurant has a clean, semi-urban feel with the cool addition of tables made from the wood of old bowling lanes.  It can be a touch noisy when the place is packed, but overall not bad.  When I've been at lunchtime, I've noticed this is a favorite place for the kids from one of the nearby middle/high school to gather and eat.  Kind of cool, given the relationship Shake Shack has with Communities In Schools.  More on that in a minute.  Most of the seating is inside, but when the weather permits, there's a decent amount of outdoor seating too.  You admire the gigantic menu on the wall when you walk in, order at the counter, take your number and find a seat.  Depending on how busy it is, they'll either call you up when your food is ready, or just might bring it to your table.  The burgers are all made from 100% hormone and antibiotic-free Angus beef, and there are vegetarian options on the menu too.  After trying the SmokeShack, the ShackBurger and the 'Shroom Burger (the vegetarian burger option), my solid favorite is the SmokeShack.  You can't go wrong with a bacon cheeseburger topped with chopped cherry peppers to add a mild zing.  Oh, be sure to get it as a double.  I've also tried the Shack-cago Dog.  While it's not thoroughly traditional, it's definitely a good variation on the Chicago style hotdog.  If you want a Chicago dog and can't find one prepared in the traditional way, this will definitely do.  Then there's dessert, which can be described in just three words:  frozen custard concretes!  If you're unfamiliar, a concrete is basically a shake that's too thick to drink through a straw.  Definitely try the totally addicting Summerlin S'mores.  To make a great place even better, this location is partnered with Communities In Schools (Nevada) and makes a small donation from the sale of every Summerlin S'mores, Red Velvet Rocks, and Crunch-stellation concrete.  So eat dessert and contribute to keeping kids in school!  (It makes the whole dessert thing guilt-free.)   Parking: this location is in Downtown Summerlin, so there's no shortage of parking lots.  If you're pressed for time or don't want a long walk, be sure to park on the north end of the shopping center.  Now go eat!",

Wife and I both had the shroom burgers which is the fried breaded portobello mushroom with cheese in the middle ( their version of a veggie burger) It's delicious. The oozing cheese from the middle with each bite really makes the difference and you won't even realize you're eating a fried mushroom. Cheese fries were also great as usual. Very satisfied this visit as I've been on all my visits.",

    "text": "I like Shake Shack...I like it just as much as I  like that other place that 95% of you compare it to. Am I  gonna compare the two? HELLZ NO!!!!, I'll Let YOU waste your time on that. If you're trying to compare, Freddy's has a much more similar concept IMHO...moving on...  We were fortunate to have attended the Elite event where it was my first time experiencing Shake Shack. We were planning to try three different burgers, but due to our location in the back of the patio, the very talked about Smoke Shack never made it to us.This was also the first Elite event where we saw DOGGIE BAGS!?!? Yup, Elites went there..classy huh? So a return visit was planned to try the Smoke Shack.  A couple weeks later, we returned already knowing what we wanted, I got a Smoke Shack and also tried a Chicken Dog, Chicago Style. Wifey liked the flavor and simplicity of the Shack Burger, so along with some fries, we were set.......until I saw a sign advertising a PUMPKIN PIE CONCRETE, so that was added for dessert and put on hold until we finished our meal.  Service is always friendly, quick, and efficient here, and although there may be a line at times, the wait times for your order don't seem long at all. As the burgers go, they are quite tasty. Shake Shack burgers have that flavor that will definitely keep people coming back. The frozen custard here is dense, rich, and smooth and a perfect end to your meal. Flavors change weekly, and the concretes are exclusive to this location only. Prices here may be a deal breaker for some, as well as portion sizes, but the Smoke Shack and concretes will definitely keep me coming back. ALOHA!!!

I wanted to use the app so I can use a promo code given by the company, but there were so many issues with the app in just placing my order, I realized it didn't even apply the code.  When I went up to the counter, I explained my situation and in showing them my order, they pointed out that I accidentally ordered it at the wrong location.  That was my own mistake in being flustered with the app.  Freaking out, I went to go cancel my order but I couldn't reach the other location.  I came back in and talked to the cashier and the manager and they said that they would reach out to the other's location manager for me.  The cashier (I think his name was Steven based on my receipt) was so nice and generous in placing the correct order and the manager was so understanding as well.  I felt so bad for causing so much trouble but the people behind the counter are so kind.    I don't recommend the app, but this location is great for service and hospitality.",

Both the hubs and I got a burger on special, some cheeseburger with bacon and their ShackSauce.  We also got an order of regular fries, and an order of cheese fries.  The burgers were so small, when I was done, I could have eaten one or two more, but not at about 600 calories each!  The fries were also so blah - the fries themselves were ok flavored, crinkled cut.  But the cheese sauce fries were just so blah!  The sauce just tasted like something close to cheez whiz.  The only good thing was, since it was Father's Day, they were giving out one free custard, which our little one loved.  Overall, a very disappointing experience, and I have to say, we will not be back.  At least we can say we've been there, but I will not be recommending it.  There are lots of other good burger places around.",

At around $13 for my burger,fries and iced tea I expected more flavor explosion on my tastebuds but this burger reminded me of a bacon cheese burger from Wendy's. The sad part is,Wendy's burgers actually have some sort of seasoning on them. I wouldn't come back here. I would choose In n Out or Five Guys over Shake Shack. I don't get the hype.",

With that, I find Shake Shack pretty darn delicious. I think they are overpriced - but this doesn't mean I won't pay the price. They are, as the three star review on yelp is appropriately titled, \"A-OK.\" I'll go back with groups, but if I am looking for a delicious burger lunch or dinner I'll skip this joint for a double cheeseburger at In-N-Out everyday. I only had their oatmeal pie milkshake but it too wasn't spectacular. Good - not great.   I think I am only so hard on this restaurant because everyone discusses it like the epitome of what a burger should be - um hardly. The SmokeShack burger is delicious but not worth ten dollars for a double. The cheese on their cheese fries is nacho style which is good for a few fries but ends up making you want regular fries by the end of it.   I will say this burger blows Red Robin out of the water for the same price. But at least at Red Robin you get some atmosphere and a waiter/waitress.   I'll be back, but I'm sure I won't be a regular.

For $35 we both got fries, burgers, small soda fountain drinks and I also grabbed a \"bag of bones\" to take home to my pugs. The food was very low quality, my \"Shroom\" burger since I don't eat beef and it sounded delicious - tasted ok but it wasn't worth $7 by itself - maybe if the fries came with it. I technically also ordered the cheese fries just to try and the cheese was this weird melted American cheese with a bland taste to it. Nothing special to them and very boring.   I officially don't see what the hype about this place is. Will I come back? Sure but is it worth the money being spent? who knows. Maybe I just went during a bad time or the staff is still new and learning but for $35 I was not satisfied.  I also am concerned with their cashier system. It took our cashier 5 minutes to figure out how to use my gift card and instead of asking someone else like her manager for help she just kept yelling at her screen and then finally showed us why she couldn't do her job correctly which made the entire 5 minutes just awkward. We also were the only ones who had to get up to get their food and then this one employee walked around the entire place passing me 3 times before finally realizing it was me to give me the bag of bones I had ordered a while back. Such an awkward time but I'll come back.",

This one is located at Downtown Summerlin, a new high-end shopping complex.  I got the Shack Stack @ $7.95 (burger with a patty-sized cheese stuffed portobello mushroom) and fries. The burger/portobello was very tasty, however, rather small, especially for the price. The meat patty itself was pretty skimpy.  The fries were like anywhere else...nothing notable.    I then had the mint chocolate frozen custard (since I wasn't full from the burger at all) which was  pretty tasty also. $3.60 got a small scoop.  Not cheap, but not outrageous. This is a trendy millennial's hang.  Kinda disappointed, but I'm not much into trendy.  Oh, service was good and attentive.  GOOD:  Tasty burgers; good service. BAD:  Pricey; small portions.

    "text": "I've heard lots of buzz about this place and I never got around to going to the one on the Strip so I figured I'd try the newly opened on in Summerlin. I've always held the belief that there is really only so much you can do with ground beef on a bun, and other than seasoning it a bit differently, it's really all about the same stuff. Shake Shack is absolute proof of that.  I went there with a buddy of mine for lunch and the place seemed kind of busy. I figured I'd try their normal bill of fare and go with a single bacon cheeseburger and a peanut butter shake. I had them throw on a cheese fries to my tab also, and got a little sticker shock when I saw the total was about 18 bucks. Seriously, for a burger, shake, and fries in a chain joint. Ugh, whatever.  The food showed up at our table about 5 minutes later and the burger looked like someone sat on it...at least 3 times. It looked about a thousand times worse than anything I've seen come in a paper wrapper in a drive through at any fast food joint. It looked terrible. I regret not getting a picture of this very disappointing burger. The fries were in a paper tray and it looked like they just took a slice of American cheese and melted it on top. It looked gross and unappetizing and didn't taste much better. The shake tasted good but it was VERY rich...it was like trying to suck a stick of butter through a straw. Once it melted down, it was OK but just too heavy.  If the price had been half of what I paid, I would probably give this place a bit better rating but overall, I have to say it was VERY disappointing eating here, especially considering the price. I will absolutely not eat here again and in the future, when I'm craving a good burger, I'll go to an In-And-Out. Hell, I'd get a Big Mac and fries instead of this place. It was definitely not worth the hype at all.",

    "text": "I very rarely leave negative comments on any establishment; if I have a bad experience, I generally think it was just a bad day for them. Shake Shack is different.   They have consistent problems. I have been served an undercooked burger more than once, and the prices are incredibly high for what you actually get. If you really want a good burger for a good price, I'd suggest Five Guys over them any day. There is nothing impressive about this chain.   They also have recycling bins, which I thought was a way to give back to the community for whom they serve. The recycling goes into the same compactor with their trash. They say the mall sorts it or it gets sorted on pickup, but that's not True, so you have to wonder: if they're willing to lie about something so innocuous, what else would they mislead their customers about?",

The service here is great don't get me wrong there. The cashier was super friendly and a few employees offered to throw out our trash and refill our waters while we were eating in the dining room. Super attentive and friendly! The food though was just meh, ok to me. I had the shroom burger which was basically a large breaded mushroom filled with cheese and topped with the standard burger toppings. I love the uniqueness of it and that it was vegetarian friendly, but it was just a little bland in the flavor department. The cheese fries were pretty disappointing too. I thought they'd use an actual cheese sauce, but it tasted more like the artificial slice kind. The only good thing I had was the chocolate shake, very rich in flavor and taste.  I'm not sure I'd really come here again unless it was super convenient or for a specific purpose. It's a little pricey for what it is.",

A burger and fries at In n Out is always fresh, and the quality is always A1, but these two burger joints just don't weigh on the same scale. I've been to Shake Shack many times and I'm surprised a lot of my homies haven't been here. So when I decided to take them here they were BLOWN away by the taste! The feeling of the burger literally melting in my mouth is what drove me to write a 5 Star review!  All the employees want satisfaction, and we are always welcomed with the best care.   Fresh never less, and the quality is beyond belief.  This place is a bit pricy, and since they do not offer combos everything is bought separately. 2 apparent Shack burger combos came out to over $31.   You get what you pay for and what I got was quality and supreme satisfaction.  The bill a tad bit higher than usual but hey, it's worth it and once in a while is ok.   Will return!",

My favorite burger is the shack stack, which is a cheeseburger with a crispy fried portobello mushroom with melted cheese. Soooo cheesy and delicious. The perfect amount of crunch, cheese and burger. If you're a cheese and shroom lover I highly recommend this burger! The cheese fries are also so bomb. I normally like my fries on the crispy side, but I don't even mind them being a little softer because the cheese is so creamy and yummy. The shakes are super thick and are pretty good, but I normally don't get a shake because the burger and fries end up being so expensive. It definitely is a little on the pricey side for a burger joint, but the food is so good and is worth a try if you've never had it.",

I will also include pictures.  Stopped in for lunch yesterday. I had heard a lot of positive feedback about Shake Shack. I have been eagerly waiting to try them out.  The restaurant is very busy, for a great reason. The vibe is very cool, and they're great for large groups. I had the Smoke Stack (Bacon Cheeseburger), fries and a small drink. My wife had the Mushroom burger, fries, and a small drink. It cost us nearly $30.00 for lunch, which I felt was a bit high for a Fast Food experience.  My burger was fantastic! The quality of the ingredients was top notch! Perfectly cooked burger and bacon. The mushroom on my wife's burger was a breaded, filled with cheese, rolled in breadcrumbs, and fried, portobello mushroom. Perfection! The French fries were perfectly cooked, golden and crunchy exterior, soft interior. Fries portion is very big. The small soft drink is smaller than any other place I've ever been to. This is fine, because they offer free refills. The problem with the refill, is every time you want one, an attendant has to get it for you. I had to get 5 refills. Each time, they give you a new cup. They fill that tiny cup with so much ice, you get maybe 5 to 8 sips. Just with me, six cups were used. I complained, thinking it's a total waste, and very unfriendly for the Environment. I was told it's Company policy.  Every employee I encountered had great Customer Service Skills, fast, efficient and very friendly.  Had it not been for the soda situation, and price. They would have definitely gotten 5 stars out of me. I might go back, if they ever change either cup sizes, or the waste of paper products. I would definitely recommend going there, at least once. It's on my top 10 best burgers, I've ever eaten.",

Overall, I don't think Shake Shack's baby burgers are bad at all.  I have a lot more pros than cons.    Pros: -Conveniently located in Downtown Summerlin -Parking is great.  You have the whole mall to find parking.  -The weather is nice in Summerlin.  -Located close to Red Rock -Their burgers are so cute and tiny.   -Shake Shack's Double Shack is one of the better sliders I've had in a long time.  -Lower in calorie because you don't get much -Their burgers won't ruin dinner.  You'll be ready to eat again about 30 minutes.  -Takes about 2 minutes to finish a burger here.  This means people are in and out.  A lot of seating.  -Love the crinkle fries -Two burgers, fries, and a drinks is less than $100.  More like $40.    Cons: -You have to wait for your meal in order to get your drinks.  -Takes a while for this \"fast food\" joint to cook your food.  -Their Double Shack, at over $8, is a really expensive slider.",

One should always get fries when ordering a burger but I decided to amp it up a bit and get bacon cheese fries and I did not regret it whatsoever. The customer service here is excellent and always check up on you to see if everything is fine. Only reason I knocked off a star was because my burger that I ordered medium came out almost medium rare / raw. I'm not trying to get anthrax or anything but the servers took care of it.",

There was no line so we were able to look over the menu on the wall and order without problem.  We found a table and before I knew it my buzzer was going off.  I picked up my meal (regular cheeseburger and drink)  and headed to the condiment bar.  After getting what I needed, I sat down and began eating.  The burger was definitely fresh, not frozen.  The bun they used reminded me of the Hawaiian rolls from the store.  I had tomato, lettuce and the Shack sauce on my burger as well.  The different flavors really helped to enhance the flavor of the meat.  I'd say the burger size itself was about medium. A little bigger than a fast food burger but smaller than a traditional sit down restaurant.  The burger went down fast!  The menu is filled with tasty treats from burgers to chicken. Hot dogs to shakes.  They even have specialty drinks and beer.  Definitely a great place to meet up with friends and relax a little.",

    "text": "Shake Shack is said to be the \"In-N-Out of the East\" and I can see how that can be, but In-N-Out will still be the preferred burger joint for me.  I got a Single Shack Burger, side of fries, and a Salted Caramel ice cream shake. Their fries are crinkle cut, just not my particular type of fry. The burger was okay, flavorful patty but I wasn't a fan of their Shake Shack sauce. The shake was good but really sweet; halfway through I was sick of it.   It's a good fast food joint, but I have definitely had better burgers. Also their prices on their burgers and fries (which must be purchased separately) are a bit on the pricier side for a fast food place.",

    "text": "Downtown Summerlin has been a bit lackluster with food options (all promise, with lack of delivery), so I'm happy to see this place open up and solidly perform both in quality of food and service. I went during their opening week and was glad that the line wasn't our the door long. Our wait time was expected after ordering (not too long though), but it did seem like a few other folks were wondering where their food orders were. Both the burgers we got were solid and the bun finally tastes like how I remember the bun tasting in their east coast locations (something about the NYNY location was a bit off). I know people complain about the higher price tag, but I'm officially a convert... no more In-n-Out for me. I'd rather pay up the extra money and go out of my way for my fast food needs. There are also a few TVs in this location, that were a lot easier to view than the NYNY location. When we were done with our food, a nice, very tall, young man proactively offered to put our tray away, which I appreciated. Some of the things I noticed:  Customers - geez,  clean up after yourselves a bit citizens of Summerlin! The workers do a great job bussing tables, but it kind of sucks seeing people really not give AF.   Entrance - Not very wheelchair or stroller-friendly, and very tight. Summerlin parents, keep the lanes clear when ordering! (again, another complaint about the customers, but I think the business could do a bit more to ease the situation). The space itself is not as expansive as the NYNY location, and their is some but not a ton of outside seating, so you do feel a bit cramped when they are really busy.   Restocking - the whole time while we were waiting for the food and eating, this employee took forever restocking the straws/napkins/condiments area and was in a ton of people's way. She definitely could have picked up the pace and finished doing that in 5 minutes or less. Get in, get out, and check on it again in 30 minutes.   Hope this place thrives and more great places keep on coming to Downtown Summerlin!",

Food: I ordered the Roadside Shack and it's basically a cheeseburger with grilled onions and bacon bits but I also added lettuce and pickles. The very first thing I noticed was the superb quality of the meat--so fresh and flavorful just by itself. I love how all of the ingredients mixed very well together in unison and complimented each other. The burger was absolutely delicious. I also was able to try the Smoke Shack, which I actually liked better than the burger I ordered. At first I thought that the cherry peppers and bacon would overwhelm the flavor of the burger, but it was just so perfect.  Service: Everyone was very helpful and attentive. While we were still deciding on what to order, one of the workers (I think he may be the manager or some type of higher-up) gave us a sample of their Frankenstein (Shackenstein) dessert, which was delicious. Mark also gave us an amazing experience by talking to us while we were seated and cleaning after our trays (we went for seconds and dessert).  Great place for burgers, I'm so happy they're in Summerlin. A MUST try!",

    "text": "Thumbs down all around.  I have heard a lot of mixed reviews for this place. Decided to take the plunge and give it a go tonight. I placed two orders, one was dine in and the second to go. Starting with the first; customer service was amazing, that's where they've earned their first star. I was buzzed only to walk up to the counter and hear an apology: \"oops, we didn't meant to, we will re buzz your pager.\" I go sit down only to be buzzed again immediately. Okay... when I arrive at the counter for the second time two orders of fries are ready, but only one burger. (I ordered two burgers) \"sorry, we can buzz you again!\" No, really, this is annoying, I ask if they can bring the burger-yes. For our troubles they also brought a third drink. Awesome, but there is only two of us...   So, when I bit into my burger, the first one which was done, it was pink. Clearly not done. Of course they'll fix it they say!! And when it is returned to me it comes with a FOURTH drink!! You cannot make this stuff up! So, my second order, it was to go. Again with the premature buzzing. Maybe they just like a crowd around the counter?? Our food finally arrives and we head home-Green Valley. My son starts eating his burger....PINK!!! Not cooked completely!  So we paid $60; got three burgers (2 of which were raw), one order of regular fries, two orders of BBQ bacon cheese fries, 2 drinks (and another two free drinks) one float and two sml concretes. I feel robbed. I'll stick with IN n OUT.",

The burger came out super fresh, moist, and tasty. The sauce in the burger added the extra touch. The lemonade tasted so refreshing (you get free refills) and the french fries was cooked just right. Not too soft and not too crunchy. Sooo good.  I decided to try the chocolate custard and it hit the spot. (They offer a free taste sample of the custard if you want to taste it first before you purchase)    Overall the experience was great. The customer service was on point. After we finished someone even came up to us and asked if she can clear our table. She was very nice. The staff from the beginning by taking our order, receiving the order, and when we left were all so friendly. We will be coming back here again.  I give this burger joint 5 happy stars!",

I would definitely put it up there as far as something I would crave for when wanting a burger. And Crinkle cut fries with nacho cheese. Yum. I think if you're into cheese as much as I am then this would be your spot Goey cheesy goodness I had the bacon double cheeseburger and the bacon was cooked perfectly it was crispy yet chewy I enjoyed it. I'm also very interested into trying the chicken sandwich here my friends that came here with us said it was the best chicken sandwich they ever had. I'll have to try it for myself next time. The reason for my 4 star is because I feel that for $35 bucks for burger fries and drinks it just doesn't make sense why it's so pricey. I'll still go back though.",

    "text": "So apparently this is the In-N-Out of the East Coast? Or so I've heard.  In any case, I knew that this would have to be a MUST try in Vegas. I ALMOST didn't get a taste of Shake Shack, but luckily enough for me, the Shake Shack on The Strip isn't the only one.   My friend took me here on a Sunday night around 9PM and it was fairly busy. There were tables, but a good amount of people were there. I had overheard my friends talking the other day about a burger with mushrooms and how good it was...so I came in look for it. However, it was nowhere in sight...I was about to order the Shake Burger, when I noticed that there was a burger called the Stack Shake or something along those lines, which was the burger I was looking for.   It was a big on the pricier side of burgers, but I told myself it was worth it, and luckily it was. This burger was absolute perfection. The mushroom is actually a patty that has melted cheese in it, stacked on top of the meat patty, which also has cheese, served with the shake shack sauce and lettuce and tomatoes.   I took my first bite and cheese oozed EVERYWHERE, which is what I LOVE. I devoured my burger because of how tasty it was! Shake Shack is totally worth it if it's a once in a while thing, but I don't know if I can afford to come by every week for it.   I feel like a traitor saying this, but Shake Shack is half a step above In-N-Out because of how amazing those fries are. I didn't order the fries at this location, but when I tried them at the one on The Strip, it was AHHHMAZING.   I definitely need to try the shakes and cheese fries next time I come across a Shake Shack! This is a definite, must try when you're on the West Coast and in Vegas!!!!",

(Insert eye roll)  My favorite is the ShackBurger (cheeseburger). I enjoy it as a single or a double with the standard lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce. Plus, I like to add onion (raw) and pickles. Amazing. The SmokeShack is really great as well. My favorite part of their burger, besides the delicious 100% Angus beef patty and fixings, is the soft and chewy potato bun! (Potato bread is awesome!!) Hamburger buns usually drive me bonkers because so many of them are dry or disproportionate to the amount of meat, etc. Their burgers are perfect.  Crinkle-cut fries aren't the most amazing or exciting potatoes in the world, but they're still tasty. Plus, if you're feeling extra gluttonous and order them with cheese, it's so darn good.  I've had a couple of their concretes and they're good, but I'm not crazy about them. Their shakes are pretty tasty, too. I don't focus much on dessert since I'm all about the burgers and fries!",

We used to drive all the way to the strip for Shake Shack so we were really happy when they opened one around the corner from our house.   Lots of indoor + outdoor seating w/ misters.  They also have great customer service! You can now place your orders online so it's ready when you get there! We mistakenly placed our order for the LV Blvd location. We tried calling the strip location to cancel w/ no answer then we got a notification our order was ready for pickup but we're at least a 30 minute drive away. So we called this location & explained the situation. They said they'd take care of cancelling the other order & transferring it to their location so we didn't get charged twice. Our food was ready when we arrived & so so yummy!!",

    "text": "I finally got around to trying Shake Shack. Now am kicking myself for waiting so long only because the first location has been in Vegas for some time. Once I heard about there second location in Downtown Summerllin. Hell yay!   I came for lunch. First impression was loving the whole look of the place from the minute walking to the restaurant. I love the outdoor patio area. Not only because it nice size, great place to people watch, chill, and hang out with friends enjoy the weather. The menu is pretty huge especially for my first time. The staff in the restaurant the whole time was simply awesome. The gentlemen taking my order explained everything well the whole concept of Shake Shack and gave me great recommendations. I ended up ordering the SmokeShack burger. I went double on the recommendation. Talk about mouth watering and tasty burger!!!! If your hungry not doubt would highly recommend going double. Single is decent size but I feel with the double the smoked bacon, cherry peppers, cheese, and sauce get the full burger experience! The burgers cooked perfect nice and juicy. Fresh. The fries was going cheese fries but the first time just wanted taste the fries. They were awesome. I enjoy the fact that the crinkle cut fries not your straight cut. It adds different texture and can only imagine put mound of cheese sauce on it settles nicely on top. The fries were nice and HOT.   Not only burgers they offer even have a vegetarian style burger, chicken, and more. The shakes need come back try my next visit. Concretes just reading the descriptions sound tasty. The drinks talk about diversity. Burger joint with different daily fresh lemonades. I love it. Selection of beers on tap not just your bland mass market ones but quality micro choices. Wines. More and more. The diversity is pretty awesome and really something for anyone here at Shake Shack.   The service was awesome. The gentleman taking my order mention earlier answered all my questions being first time great. Positive vibe, friendly, and next thing know talking about endurance sports. Even when I was sitting down couple different workers checked see how everything was going they had that same positive happy go vibe. One of them asked if needed refill on my soda. They have no fountain machine out front.   Shake Shack another great addition to Downtown Summerlin food scene. One that will be coming back again soon.....",

The Shack burger is my go-to-burger.  It has that old fashion taste which I find myself craving and makes this place my first choice when in the mood for a burger. They also sell serveral hotdog options.   Fries are crinkle cut and delicious too; just wish they stayed hot a little longer. It would be nice to have onion rings or other fry options too.   And you definitely can't forget about the sweet stuff.  Although it's seasonal, there pumpkin pie concrete is my favorite, but I have tried the apple and also the s'mores concrete which are also great.  Their vanilla custard all on its own is deliciously silky goodness and they do offer concrete samples.    They also serve root beer on tap which is also very tasty as well as hotdog creations.   The service is very courteous and the managers come around to make sure your meal is up to standards.  I'm a fan!",

They also check in with you to see if you are doing okay. My only complaint is that sometimes they put too much Shack Sauce (I think that's what it's called). I couldn't really enjoy my burger with all the sauce on it. I came here with a friend and sauce was dripping from hers! Other then that, this place is nice. There is also something for your dog so they won't be hungry! They have the Pooch-ini with vanilla custard with a Shackburger dog biscuit with peanut butter sauce. I recommend the Smokeshack, which is a great burger to me. It has a nice amount of bacon with a bit of spice in it. Very good. I recommend this place to people who love the taste of a good burger!",

I honestly don't think there is a True comparison between Shake Shack and In-N_out, because Shake Shack is about double the price for a standard burger, yes Shack Shake tastes better (perfectly seasoned patty, crisp lettuce, yummy bun), but because In-N-Out is a drive through and cheaper, I would expect a little less from them.",

So here's the deal I've been going to shake shack since their OG location in NYC and it's just as delicious as that day 1 bite. Their smoky shack sauce, perfect cheese sauce paired with crinkle cut fries and the potato bun puts their burger in another league compared to InAndOut.  There is nothing anyone can say that will ever change my mind about this burger. We are a family of die hard shake shackers 4 life.   Mom Rating is 5/5 for self serve water, \"kid friendly food\", high chairs, and a changing table in the bathroom.   Sigh I Love you Shake Shake never change",

Which really reflects on my choice of star reward.   However, today I had to mention the customer service I received. Often good service includes a nice greeting, smile and getting customer's orders. One thing I had an issue with was it seemed like the cashier was laughing and making comments about every item I was ordering. He would chuckle or make exaggerated noises to seem almost belittling rather than trying to strike up a conversation with a customer. I don't mean to whine or complain about this but I did notice that these types of behaviors can make a customer happy (satisfied) with their services or accidentally piss off a customer.",

There's some other locations too that include The District in Henderson, The Premium Outlet Mall North, and of course, New York, New York hotel on the strip. I also just researched that it's at the T-Mobile Arena? Didn't even know that.  When Shake Shack first came to the strip, I didn't know what the hype was about. It was another burger joint from New York that was really popular. Anything that's hyped up, I have to try it. Their burgers are full of flavor with their known shack sauce and I also heard they are known for their cheese fries. \"Whatever I'm getting cheese fries.\" - Mean Girls  I usually get the Shack Burger and their cheese fries. I recently tried their Smoke Shack and bacon cheese fries and it was my new favorite! The Smoke Shack has these peppers and it gives it a little kick.

By the way gals and guys, their SmokeHouse is a burger, but they'll let you replace the burger with the crispy chicken.  I promise to try the burger at some point.  Those pictures!  Some appetizing stuff!  Just yesterday I had the crispy chicken again as a smokehouse.  I cannot get enough of the flavor!  They dice up those spicy red bell peppers and the sauce they use goes so well with everything.  Mmmm and their Portobello Burger nomzzzz!  There's no meat, by the way.  It is fried crispy - so it's pretending to be healthy vegetarian.  Don't over think it.  Vegetarians can have extra fun eating this meal.  It's ooookaaaay :)  Well the salted caramel milkshake is on the sugar high side.  Maybe let them know.  Otherwise their brownie and coffee milkshakes are awesome!

I've always heard about shake shack and knew that they are a east coast burger joint where in-n-out is the well known west coast burger joint. But slowly these chains spread across the states. Sadly, Hawaii doesn't have such deliciousness and if we do.. they charge us an arm for it.. Oh the struggle.  Although on the strip they had a shake shack next to the hotel I was staying at, we decided to come here since my friend had to work around the area. This shake shack is located on the outside of a mall.   My friend and I shared a Shake Stack Burger, double down fries (which was big as my head or bigger), I got a single concrete and he got a shake. That burger was so good... the cheese melted on top of the patty and the bun was just right.. Don't you hate when your bun is bigger than the patty ratio.. well this doesn't happen here! I liked my single concrete (it's ice cream or frozen custard.. I'm not sure.) My friend didn't think the shake was that great.  Glad that we shared, we didn't know the fries was gonna be huge when we were ordering. We had a big dinner to look forward to also. Phew! It was so good but I couldn't finish, thankfully he finished it all.",

For example, after ordering your food, there are always people asking if you want a refill at no extra charge.   The burger is on point as always, and whenever I'm on the West side of Vegas, I'll definitely stop by at least once.   Not much else to say about this place, other than when you book an airbnb in Summerlin, it definitely beats the 1+ hour wait time at other locations.",

We asked what the shacksause was and the worker couldn't even tell us what it was, what it was similar to or what was in it.   We then took the lid off of our $5.29 shake and it wasn't even filled all the way. When I went up to question why my shake wasn't filled all the way the worker replied that they don't fill them all the way!  Next was the burger, while it did taste good it wasn't so good that I would pay $5.29 ever again for JUST a burger. I could go to a countless number of other places where I could pay just about the same amount and get just as good of a burger and get fries and a drink with it.   And then we come to the fries. Again they tasted fine but were a little over cooked for my liking.  Needless to say we will NEVER be coming back here again.   2 burgers, a shake, fry and a soda for $23 no thank you. I came hungry and am now leaving hungry. We will be returning to our usual cheaper prices and good tasting burger places.",

The only complaint that I have was that the tables were dirty.  There wasn't anybody going around cleaning up the tables.  Also, compared to other burger joints, this place was a little pricey.

Cashier answered questions we asked and she was right on. One of us had the Shack burger he said it was a little small but big on flavor. I had the chicken burger which was a treat... and we all shared the cheese fries. Quality ingredients. More cheese would have been good..but quality on everything was great and would come back again!

SHAKE SHACK?!?! OMG.\" We absolutely love the flavors of their burgers. This is the burger we crave over every other burger in town and we never knew there was a Shake Shack with much easier access than the New York New York restaurant. We quickly made our decision and explored the quiet, relaxing, landscaped area of the mall on our way over.   When we arrived we noticed an awesome ping pong table outside which I turned down just in case I was awful at playing ping pong. I didn't want to hit any cars parked on the curb right next to the table. I ordered my regular, the ShackBurger and took a look at the concretes and custards. I noticed a smores concrete, specific to Downtown Summerlin's menu which was awesome. When I went to my first Shake Shack in Washington D.C., I had a s'mores concrete and I was always looking forward to having another one but there were never any on The Strip. My bf ordered the new ChickenShack which he really enjoyed. He was actually upset when he was done with it. haha! He also ordered the brown sugar (the flavor of the week) shake.   Overall, it was a great lunch experience. The cashier was a sweetheart. Our food was prepared fast and the burgers/sandwiches lived up to our standards. The desserts were sadly not enjoyed by either of us. We actually decided that we would stop ordering the desserts from there. That's alright though because those burgers and fries will always have us coming back for more.",

They have tvs all over the restaurant which makes it more enjoyable with children.  Once again Mike was one of the best managers I have ever met and engaged in conversation with us!

    "text": "I had a single hamburger, fries, and a cold milk. Although I ordered a vanilla shake, technically.   Overpriced. Overpriced. Overpriced. Insane. The burgers themselves are pretty good, to be sure, but I can get one just as good in  the time for  1/2 the price at In-n-Out. At these prices, this place brings nothing to the table.   The fries were not great. I left half of them uneaten; a real rarity for me. The wall says they're hand cut and fresh, but maybe that is just what's written on the freezer bag they came out of. They sure don't taste fresh if they are, and when I say fresh I mean when I drive through at In-N-Out I can see a kid reevaluating his short life's choices while he runs whole russets through that chopper. That's fresh.  I called my shake a cold milk at the beginning. To be totally fair, there was obviously some ice cream in it, but this is one of the least appealing milk shakes I've ever had. Here's the test: suck it through a straw. If you feel like your eyeballs are going to get pulled inside your head, it's too thick. If you let the straw go and the milkshake that is left behind immediately runs back down into the cup, it's too runny. Not only did this milkshake run like the wind back out of the straw, it was just bleh for flavor. A True disappointment.   I say all of this with a heavy heart. I had my first Shake Shack burger at Bite of Las Vegas, 94.1 FM's yearly music and food festival. The burger was great! And so was the burger I had in-house on this visit. I thought I was getting price-raped at Bite of Las Vegas because I was at a food festival with $12 Miller Lights. Turns out I was getting price-raped because that's the business model here. And between that and the fries, and the shake, being so lackluster I don't care how good the burgers are. I'm not going to pay for them.",

This place is far from the strip so you don't see much tourists here and there's hardly a line. They open at 11 am and it is near the edge of the complex beside the California pizza kitchen.  I always get the shroom burger. Mainly because the burger isn't too special compared to other burger joint and the shroom burger stands out and this is the only place I get it.  The shakes here are good and thick but for 5$ for such a small amount... that's a negative. I'd rather go to in and out for a similar concoction.  It's cute they have stuff for dogs and alcoholic beverages and they have tons of tv and good a/c but honestly I only come here when people visit us here.",

I had mine with cheese and that was a great decision. I also got a generous serving of bacon after some confusion about getting my order right. The peanut butter is served on the side and it's more of a sauce but just like regular peanut butter! No lettuce, tomato, etc. just lots of yummy bacon, peanut butter and cheese good!ness.   I also had the black & white milkshake which was pretty tasty but not that great for almost $6.  I've read many reviews calling the Shack fast food. I'm not sold on it being fast food, maybe it's fast casual- a step up from traditional fast food places. The prices certainly aren't fast food prices and the quality is better.",

I'd say it's like in n out and five guys got together and had a hipster baby that likes cheese wiz and dogs. I found it delicious but greasy. Hubs is not a fan due to the amount of grease. The burger is small and you could prob get away with eating two burgers.... fries came out crunchy and hot. The sodas are behind the counter and you must ask for refills. We're in vegas and spoiled and not used to places like that. The shack burger was good cause of the cheese plus cheese sauce, no mayo or ketchup comes on it, but you don't really need it. Did not have the shakes or dogs. But I will have to come back with my kiddies without hubs. I really enjoyed one of the employees. I should of got his name, but he is REALLY tall and slim, white guy. He went far above and beyond what I expect of a fast food place. He asked if I needed help with getting condiments since I was holding a baby and pushing a stroller. He was quick to clean up our trays and was Johnny on the spot to clean the tables. He also took care of moving the highchair and opened the door for us as we left. If management sees this we ate on 3/17 at about 830 pm. Super awesome",

The burgers seem to be cooked in the same way smashburger does theirs but my burger was overcooked and on the small side. It wasn't very satisfying.  There is no self serve fountain for drinks so you have to request one at the counter. Although I brought my cup for a refill, I was given a new cup. IMO that's wasteful.

They're so dog friendly and most of the time bring him his own clean bowl of water.   This gourmet take on classic fast food serves tasty treats in bite size. Even as a female that eats less than most, many times I am still hungry after eating a Shake shack burger and fries. You may want to order two burgers preemptively. Don't get me wrong, I still love the place. The ingredients, customer service, and community service is of the highest quality which are all important to me.   As a vegetarian the only option is the 'shroom burger and fries. It's great. I come here for it often.    We've been to many Shake Shacks around the country and this is the only location where you can get your food in less than 10 min from walking in!  Here's a no-line-Shake-shack!",

The one in Brooklyn in DUMBO is somewhat cute and trendy and has outside seating as most locations do.   I've tried the burger and shroom burger with their crinkle cut fries and cheese fries. ALL ARE AMAZING! I also recently tried their gluten free bun, which was a preference and definitely preferred the regular almost like Hawaiian bun that melts in your mouth. I also tried their vanilla custard with sprinkles as a birthday surprise for our friend. It was definitely the cherry on top to our meal!",

I had ordered the Shroom Burger, understood that it was the vegetarian burger on the menu but did not realize that it was a huge (from what I could tell) portabella mushroom, breaded and that had acted as the \"meat patty\". I have to say that it has got to be the best veggie burger that I've had in town. The El Cortez Cafe used to have a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBOMB.com&s=ac71b33d32e90570e9c0d70edf9b4cac5f20e98e10501794c62801370f5dd3f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BOMB.com</a> veggie burger but they have removed it from the menu- BOO El Cortez, BOO!!!  The restaurant has modern decor, the staff is insanely friendly and from what i can tell, they keep the place pretty clean! They also have a ping pong table out front and while it's still not too hot outside (when the sun isn't out) you may find me out there. Just kidding, I don't play ping pong.   The Gist: If I'm here, I'll order the Shroom Burger bc, YUM!!!",

If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, i'm pretty sure it's a duck.  Gourmet just isn't served in a 10cent paper fry holder and paper wrapper.  The patty is thin, and the burger is tiny.     If you wanted a REAL restaurant gourmet burger, I suggest yardhouse or fusion burger, where the burgers have restaurant style sized patties served with shoestring fries, ON a plate WITH waiter service.  And maybe order a side of french onion soup too.   I can't taste the difference if the potatoes are actually from yukon (where is that anyways) and if you walked the cows home from the farm and you fed it organic strawberries it's whole life.  It tastes like burgers and fries, just like Dasani tastes like water.  Now as a point of reference, the one star is just for it claiming to be gourmet burger.  If it had claimed to be a normal burger joint, i'd rate it as a normal burger joint.",

After watching Planet of the Apes at the Regal Theaters we walked over to the Shake Shack to get a bite to eat.   I was not disappointed by anything there but the only thing short in expectation was the hot cherry peppers that was listed in their Smokeshack burger. Don't get me wrong, the beef patty was fresh and buns were perfection, however, I wanted something spicy so I made my decision based on the menu I read. I forgive them though because there was a great amount of bacon in between those buns...c'mon who doesn't like bacon?!  A burger was $6 + which is a reasonable price for the quality burger they serve and the soft drinks came with unlimited refills (free of extra charge). The waiters were friendly and seemed happy to be there.   There are booth seating, table seating and quick service. It was a clean and kid friendly setting so we had no problems chit chatting after our meal and just hanging at the shack for an extra 20 minutes. I highly recommend this place.",

First time here and the burgers are the best I have ever tried. Me and my friend shared foods and cutting the burger even with a plastic knife is like the knife-through-butter technique used in taekwondo.   Me and my friend finished eating and was catching up on life when a professional and accommodating server came by to take our trash which I did not expect to happen.

Can't really compare this place to In and Out because this place is more on the gourmet side to where In and Out is more on the fast food side.   I do like Shake Shack but it is a tad overpriced I feel. The Shack Stack Burger is darn good but way too small. I could eat three of these. And their $10.00 each alone! No fries or drink. I'd rather do In and Out.   The fries are good too. The cheese on them makes them really good.   My niece got a hotdog and loved it. I had a bite and thought it was just any other hotdog haha.   Clean place and lots of tv's around if you wanna watch sports or the news. Great burgers and fries if you eat moderate to small portions and are willing to pay a little more than most burger joints.",

Burgers were delicious, fries tasty and they have a customer now.  If you are looking for a burger that doesn't feel like it came off an assembly line and a nice place to enjoy it give the team at Shake Shack a whirl.",

    "text": "I was to Shake Shack once before but that was for a Yelp event.  I came back to try the place when it wasn't as crowded and busy as when I was there the first time.  Since we were served at the Yelp event, I didn't know the routine of entering the right doors, placing your order, getting your buzzer, and then waiting for the food to be ready.  A gentleman leaving told me to go in the other door and order there.  After looking at the menu for a short time, I got two SmokeShack burgers--cheeseburgers with bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and ShackSauce. I ordered two fries with cheese.   I also ordered two regular iced teas.  I then took the buzzer, took my seat, and waited for for the buzzer to go off.  There was no drink until you picked up the order which is a minus for me.  I could have gotten some ice water but why no drink while you sit there?  In a reasonable amount of time, the buzzer went off and I collected dinner for the two of us from the pick up area.  The burgers were OK.  The bacon was good as was the tang from the cherry peppers but I got no flavor from the ShackSauce at all.  It was a colossal mistake to get the cheese fries.  That was partially my fault.  I should never order fries with any topping.  The cheese on these fries was overwhelming and it made the somewhat soggy fries even more so.  Naked fries as the best fries in my book.  Before we were finished, the fries were a soggy heap that would have made good food fight material.  We decided we'd try a concrete for dessert.  My wife wanted the Red Velvet and I got the S'mores.  After ordering, the counter critter told me their regular blender wasn't working and that the concrete would have the normal mix ins on top.  Really, one of your claims to fame is your concrete and you have one blender.  That's like saying our regular grill is broken.  Is a frozen patty OK?  They weren't concretes and even if the accoutrements had been mixed in, I don't see how this frozen custard could ever be called \"concrete.\"  In summation, it was worth a try.  There are so many better options where you can get your own drinks and refills.  And, you don't have to go through the ordering line all over again.",

    "text": "It used to be Fatburger was my favorite burger joint (but it isn't like I eat burgers all the time, either, I must mention, to clarify), but this one is the real deal. The meat (100% angus, hormone & antibiotic free) is the main event here. It is tender, juicy, and it's responsibly-sourced (A + in my book, as I am becoming aware of real foods and nutrition as a whole, so I am trying to eat better, but it's a process...).  We've been here a few times, and the average cost for us (family of three) to enjoy a yummy lunch is about $25 (hubby says it's pricey, but I don't mind it when it's this delicious; this is quality over quantity). Our most recent lunch this past saturday, was three burgers (all different types), one order of fries, and one drink. I had to pace myself and not rush into eating my burger (savor, MMM). It was perfect. The shake shack sauce was a standout too. The non-GMO buns are soft, pillowy. Usually our son gets the all-beef hotdog, but he wanted a crabby-patty (Sponge Bob speak). He finished it, but first he was grubbing on the fries. (I don't usually like crinkle fries because they tend to be soggy and oil-soaked, but not these ones, which were crispy.) He is a carnivore (always wants more meat), though, and he finished his burger, bun and all. It is a good thing when we can get our picky son to eat something and finish it without saying \"I'll finish it tomorrow\" or \"Let's bring it home.\"    The lunch rush equals busy parking lots nearby, so we had to stalk someone leaving, and we got lucky. The line to order was very long (almost to the front door), but it went fast (you order and pay at the front). All the outside seating on a beautiful sunny day was taken! Inside was a different story, surprisingly, many tables were free. Like all venues in LV when it gets warm outside, inside temps are very cool. The staff is extremely nice and helpful, and while there isn't table service, they clear your table and check in with you and your meal, on the taste of your food. The bathrooms are clean.   I should also mention that a location is opening soon at The District in Henderson.",

Over the years I did go several times to the NYC location and the last time I had it was at least 6-8 years ago. So at this visit, I ordered the cheese fries and they were great!  A good amount of cheese on it and the fries were nice and crispy. The chick'n shack was crispy, lots of pickles but the bread was a little too soft to my liking. The boyfriend ordered the shack-cago dog and the double shack burger. He liked both but he really preferred the cheese fries and he ordered another serving!  There was plenty of seating and no long lines at this location. Their facilities were clean and their employees were very friendly. There was a particular employee that was awesome because he asked if we wanted a refill for our drinks, we said yes and he delivered it to us. We didn't even ask. He was awesome!  I would give the service 4 stars and the food 3.5 stars.   If I was in Las Vegas and around the Summerlin area, I would visit this location again.",

Ordered the double cheeseburger, hot dogs, cheese fries, and the chicken sandwich. I did like the chicken sandwich, its  breaded and fried and comes with a flavored mayo. My husband really liked the cheeseburger. The meat was good quality they are just really small for the price. The cheese on the fries tasted weird , but the hotdogs were good but incoyld have made them at home just the same. They are over priced. Glad I tried but wouldn't go back!",

Added a side of cheese sauce for the fries and not bad.  It has a limited menu, four burgers and three dogs, but it has custard \"concrete\" shakes and beer & wine too.  Bottom line is its good (for a burger) but not cheap.",

    "text": "It was my first time eating at Shake Shack and I was very impressed. My brother was raving about it since the time he tried it in New York. The customer service was outstanding! One of the workers stood by the door and handed us a menu. He took the time to help us choose what we wanted since it was my first time there. The line was extremely short and the menu had a lot to choose from but not an overwhelming amount of items. The cash register person was very professional but I was a little bit confused when she didn't know what a plain cheeseburger was. I got the cheese crinkle fries and they were the best! They tasted a little bit like nacho cheese and the cheese was really smooth and gooey. I got the shakeshackburger and it was ok. The burger was a pretty cold. The patty was just as thin as in n outs but less charred. The veggies were extremely fresh and you could actually taste it. I also got the strawberry milkshake and it was better than in n outs because it was less sugary. All in all, everything was great except I would rather get a burger from in n out. The price was outrageous for a fast food restaurant. The total for me and my brother was $35 and we each got a burger, shake, and cheese fries.",

Son ordered a concrete and a single burger with the mushroom on it.  The entire meal, he was upset over the lack of value.   $15.34 for a small ice cream and not a particularly large burger.  I ordered the mushroom burger and really liked it and an order of fries.  Nothing special about the fries.  My meal was $10.00+.    The employees are very nice and the place is clean and well kept.  I think that I have raised my son to appreciate bang for his buck and Shake Shack doesn't really measure up.",

After waiting for 7 burgers and 4 fries for 1 hour and 15 mins we decided to go check on what the status of our food was.  Turns out they NEVER  put our order in!!!! What was more disturbing was as my brother and sister is standing there talking to the manager an order of 9 burgers and 6 fries and 12 numbers after us was ready.  We never once received an apology from this so called manager so we ended up getting a refund on our order.  NEVER again will I set foot into to place and I will make sure all my friends and family know what kind of customer service this place offers.  I've been a manager for almost half my life and I would never treat my customers this way.",

Since we were hungry we decided to try a burger and the chicken shack after the gentlemen raved about how awesome and \"filling\" their burgers were. My boyfriend isn't a small guy and we both lift. The guy ringing us up could see how huge my boyfriend was but continued to convince we didn't need large fries with our burgers because we would be full. After we ordered and they called us when our food was ready, I watched my boyfriends face in serious disappointment when he was walking towards me with the food. I looked at the size of the burgers and thought this was a joke. The fries were basic crinkled fries you could buy frozen at the grocery store and while the burgers were good they were so tiny. My boyfriend took three bites and was done. His cheese fries were weak!... Same basic fries with some American cheese barely on them. We paid $26 bucks and still hungry. We paid $16 at smash burger and love every bit of it....for a better price. Sorry but I'll leave this place be. Don't come here if you're really hungry......",

The batter was crispy and although they glistened with oil, still had a somewhat light & tasty flavor.  The chicken was tender, but had a high sodium flavor and other 'flavors' difficult for me to describe other than... it reminded me of highly processed frozen chicken nuggets I can purchase at a grocery store.  The nuggets were disappointing.  The BBQ sauce that came with them was delicious!  I put it on my cheeseburger.  I would purchase the BBQ sauce if it was bottled; ready for retail.  The coffee shake is \"perfection\", and the burgers are consistently very good as well.  Service is consistently friendly and efficient.",

I came with my family and we all either ordered the shack burger or the chick'n shack. As I wanted to fairly compare with in-n-out, I just got their regular shack burger. It was a good burger, but felt really not worth it. When it came out my burger felt small, and was kind of expensive, for what it was. My brother described the taste as \"something that you can make at home\"-- which can be good or bad. It was a solid burger, but not filling because it was on the small side.   What I really enjoyed was the chick'n shack. My mom thought it was dry, but I personally really liked it. It was the perfect amount of crispy.  I probably would not come back to a shake shack, if I have other options. Its overpriced for what you get. The food is not bad, but not life changing either.",

I do have to admit that the shack stack was very delicious. The fried cheese mushroom was so genius and complimented the meat very well. I also got cheese fries and they were the best cheese fries I've had and I like them better than In-n-out's cheese fries. As for shakes, my family got the coffee, strawberry, and black sesame. COFFEE IS THE OBVIOUS WINNER!!! Black sesame was okay to me, you'll like it if you like kind of a nutty taste. Strawberry was basic, I like the strawberry shake at Steak 'n Shake better. Okay but the coffee milkshake SMACKS!!! My mom is a hardcore coffee person (we're viet, viet people know coffee) and even she liked it and said it was the best coffee shake she's had!! I wouldn't go here very often, but I would totally stop by again if I were in the area.",

I got the regular single burger and my boyfriend got the bacon burger. Both were excellent. We both especially loved the potato bun. It really adds to the burger experience. The burgers are perfectly cooked, not remotely dry. We also got the french fries. We weren't going to get them at first because we both don't like crinkle cut, but we were pleasantly surprised. The fries are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Will definitely come back and try the rest of the menu.",

After reading their websites we chose the Shack because of their choice of food they served. No antibiotics in the meat and so on.   I have been waiting to try a Shake Shack and the opportunity finally arose. This is in downtown Summerlin. Meaning a nice little city center that has many options for shopping and food.   Our gps did not take us exactly to SS, so we parked the car and walked around window shopping and enjoying the beautiful sunny day.   We turned a corner and found the Shack. It was a busy place but we got our food quickly. My friend ordered a Cheeseburger and said it was awesome. I got the mushroom burger. The cheeseburger was not greasy and tasted like it was grilled. She says the Shack sauce was good. We shared a cheese fries. I had a lemonade that tasted not homemade on site. We were happy with our meals. It was a great fast food snack.   Sit outside if you get the chance. The location is shaded and clean.   Recommend everyone go to the Shake Shack.",

Other than those factors, Shake Shack is a solid choice for hamburgers and chicken sandwiches and hotdogs.  They even dog biscuits....that is hilarious.  My order was the chicken sandwich, the single burger, and fries. The fries are crinkle cut, but they are much better than Raising Canes'...easily.  Give it a go if there are no Habits around.",

I am pleased to say that the food was in fact great.  While I still believe it's a bit pricey for a burger, the meal tasted really good.  Quality meat, cheese and I really liked the bun.  Fries were good too.  Sad we didn't order a shake but maybe we will swing by after the movie tomorrow.    Postmates and the restaurant did a good job sending enough ketchup and napkins.  Can't tell you how annoying it is when they forget that sorta stuff.    Good job on changing our minds on your food, Shake Shack!

Not the most friendly welcoming or informative staff, the interaction was very transactional. I was hoping that the food quality would make up for it, especially since the menu is very narrow for burgers. Disappointingly, the meat was under seasoned, riding on the sweet bun flavor.  It was bun show more than anything. Fries were hearty and crisp. The lemonade and shake was overly sweet. Not something to write home about. On top of all this, I paid over 20 dollars for substandard service and food in an \"affluent\" mall.",

I forgot why I never came back until I came here the other night for a Milk Shake and my teen recommended this place.   We get milk shakes, which were over $5.00 each and we got an equivalent of a Wendy's small frosty size.  We also ordered fries and burgers. They were all doubles.  Each burger was $9.00 to $11.00 dollars each. And finally 2 cheesey fries.    The cost came out to over $60.  The food was good, however the price is RIDICULOUS!   I could've made out about $20 cheaper with similar a order at Five Guys and about $35 cheaper at In-n-Out...  If you're a rich baller, then please have at it.  Me?  I make a very decent living but I still count my beans, especially with three hungry teen boys.  I will avoid this place like the plague again, unless they become more competitive in their prices... We have A LOT more local choices these days so Shake Shack should keep that in mind!  The place was nice and clean, the girl who took my order was a pleasure. The heat was broken, but we didn't care...it's winter time! The place was empty as well with 1 hour before closing.   My only other problem besides the exorbitant pricing was the fact that the street parking next to the joint was coned off for valet. And it was empty. So we had to park pretty far away.  This restaurant probably couldn't help that anyway, but it annoyed me.",

Those crispy fries with cheese drizzle on the top, I love you and I can eat them all day long. And guys! Their portobello 'shroom' burger, oh my god, this was so delicious and there was cheese in between portobello and that deep fried shroom ball with burger buns, they were just so freaking delicious. Highly recommended to this burger, I wasn't even a vegetarian myself and I love eating this! I enjoyed every single bites of it #Foodgasm! And their milkshake was very rich too, but too heavy for me not a big fan of it. Overall, I really dig this and I hope to meet you again in the near future!",

I ordered via the app. I was told that I would receive a text when my order was done. I'm thinking if you say 1:30, the food will be fresh. I guess they start cooking it when you order! I'm so disappointed. I ordered it well done...There were red and pink spots throughout the patty. The only hot thing was the cheese sauce. Tired of spending money on bad food.

This night, I got the Shack Stack, which is the Shack and the Shroom Burger together. I have small hands, so the burger, width-wise, is not big. However it was stacked high because the mushroom is thick.  For drinks, my husband got a rootbeer and a chocolate frozen custard shake. We're silly sometimes, so I took a big slurp of the shake and while my mouth was still full, backed it up with rootbeer. Yes, it was good. But, I recommend probably just going with the Float option.  Let me just end this review with, be nice. Just be a good person and thank the servers that come by to ask how you're doing, if you need anything else, or come to pick up your plates. Compliment them on the food and their service (if you should experience these things). Because if you do, they just might have an extra free custard cone card for you that you can use the next time you go. I can tell you, not everyone got one that night.",

    "text": "I'm really torn on how many stars to give. Don't get me wrong, my burger and fries were pretty good....but nothing memorable or \"out of this world.\" Shake Shack is located by MTO cafe, Crave and Fogo de Chao.  I ordered the hamburger with all the fixins (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles and ShackSauce.) Also got a side of their regular fries. Super tempted to get the cheese fries but I need to watch my waistline.   Am I the only one who thought the burger was on the smaller size? It's not as small White Castle (then again, those are more like sliders) and it's not the size of an In n Out burger. Just thought it was.....kind of....an awkward size? It even reminded me of elementary school lunches. Like I could've gone for another burger if I really wanted to. And trust me, I'm 5'1, one-hundred and something pounds and I still wasn't completely satisfied after. I guess in the end, it's for the better. I still got my burger fix without walking outta there feeling like a blob. But for big eaters....or even normal sized eaters....you may have to order two burgers...which will cost you about $8-9 in total. I don't know man....I don't think it's worth it. There are plenty of other better burger joints in this city.  So....3 stars it is. It's really just \"A-OK.\" Don't know why there's such a hype though.....am I missing something??",

I've seen many YouTube videos of Shake Shack and how people said this place was awesome, so expectations were really high.  I don't know if we expected too much but I have to say we were disappointed.  The burgers were okay.  The cheese fries were okay.  The lemonade was okay too.  Needless to say, for our $25.11 it was really disappointing.  My husband still prefers the burgers from In-N-Out and I have to say that Hot Dog On A Stick makes a better lemonade.  This place did not make our list for places that we want to come back to.  Sorry - we really wanted to like this place.  Sadly, we didn't like it all that much =(  It wasn't horrible so it's a 3 from hubby and I",

We spent $40 for basically a Hot Dog, a Bacon cheeseburger , Chicken sandwich , a small Lemonade, small milkshake (tasted way better shakes elsewhere) and a beer. The location is nice but other than that, I'm glad I can say I have tried Shake Shack but I won't be eating it anytime soon if ever.    To each its own though, I know I have read other reviews and they love this place .   I'm giving this place only a 2 star based on food. Staff was friendly and location was nice.",

My only complaint is that it is rather on the small size and I'm a woman.  My husband, sons and the rest of the team had to order 2 burgers each which means it is very pricey.  Crinkle fries were good but get the cheese fries w/ bacon, so much better!  The chick n shack was also very good, crispy not greasy.  For me personally the shack stack was the best there.  Dessert wise shakes we're not bad but the red velvet concrete was amazing!!!  In my opinion, In N Out still reigns supreme but Shake Shack is tied second alongside The Habit.",

    "text": "The best Shake Shack burger I've tried has been the Smoke Shack. The little bit of heat from the chopped cherry peppers is an amazing complement to the smoked bacon and ShackSauce. The Shack Stack with its beef patty and fried portobello is tasty too, but at $9.59 for a single, it borders on pricey for a fast food spot. With all their burgers the buns are too squishy for my tastes (I prefer them toasted and firmer) and the beef patties lack the sear and crust of better burgers around town. The best thing going for Shake Shack are the concretes. In particular, the Red Velvet Rocks with vanilla custard and chunks of red velvet cheesecake is a reason to come back over and over.  3.5 Stars",

    "text": "The fast food playing field is changing drastically. The era of fast food chains getting away with serving mediocre food cooked in greasy oil with impersonal service in a sterile environment designed to get you in and out is facing intense competition from the newer generation of fast food chains. This new generation of fast food chains is being led by Shake Shack, Five Guys, and Smash Burger.      After hiking in Calico Basin and the streets of Downtown Summerlin, my brother and I were up for a post-hike dinner in Shake Shack. I had been looking forward to biting into a Smokestack burger. In recent times, I had visited Shake Shack four times and  developed an appreciation for their Smokeshack burger.      Just like downtown Summerlin is the future of the regional shopping mall, Shake Shack is the future of the fast food restaurant. My experience describes dining in a futuristic fast food restaurant. After ordering from the menu on the wall (not over a counter), the friendly cashier presented me with a beeper. Instead of waiting by a counter for other people, or hearing order numbers go off, the gentle buzz of a beeper went off when the food was ready. The dining room is an environment that encouraged me to relax. This is totally disparate from a sundry of the fast food restaurants walled with plate glass windows overlooking the highway where the psychological message has been to eat up and get back on the road. In Shake Shack the interior feels more like a casual full service restaurant than a fast food restaurant. From my table I overlooked a couple of close caption HD TV sets playing football and \"Shriek.\" If it was a warm day, I could of sat outside in the patio overlooking the beautiful arroyo park in downtown Summerlin. Whether I sat inside or outside, there was an employee offering to dump my garbage. And if I really wanted to relax, instead of a Coke with my crinkly fries, I could have enjoyed a draft beer. Biting into a Smokestack burger was more than enough to make me relax.       Shake Shack has been consistent with quality. In similar fashion to the past three visits the Smoke Shack burger elevated my taste buds. That 100% angus beef between two soft buns were the delicious prime ingredients that complimented Applewood bacon, red peppers, and that mysterious Shake Shack sauce. The crinkly cut fries were good but not Nathan's greatness.      It seems that Las Vegans including yours truly Daniel. S love Shake Shack. But Shake Shack is doing a Winco business strategy where they build a couple of restaurants that require  people to drive a distance to come to them. Currently the only other Las Vegas location is in New York - New York.     Speaking of New York - New York, I want to clarify a major Shake Shack misconception. There is a misconception that Shake Shack is the IN N Out Burger of New York and they are all over the New York metropolitan area. Not True at all. I grew up in New York and never heard of them. Throughout my young adulthood there was a few locations in the city. Only recently did they expand to the Suffolk County suburbs of New York. They are totally different from IN N Out. Shake Shack goes for around $12 where In N Out is about half the price. Shake Shack offers several different items where In N Out offers a few. From growing up in New York, I feel thar White Castle would be comparable to IN N Out.    On the other hand what is the antithesis of a misconception is that Shake Shack is fantastic. With all the four star reviews including this one, it is foreseeable to walk into this futuristic fast food restaurant and set eyes on the \"People Love Us on Yelp\"  sticker.",

His name is Steven. I asked him about a couple of choices I had in mind, and without hesitation, he was able to recommend a burger that I said yes to (the smoke shack). He asked about fries, regular or with cheese, and I asked about the cheese. Steven excused himself for a second and came back with a sample of the cheese - whoa! Who does that without asking if I'd like to try it...I was sold and ordered the cheese fries, with the cheese on the side as he recommended that too.  The burger was just the right amount that didn't make you walk away feeling stuffed. The fries were crispy and the fondue-like cheese didn't overpower my flavorful burger.  It was a nice Friday night burger meal!! And an even better service staff that makes you feel happy!!",

    "text": "Okay Ben, you've won me over! After my last review, I received two burger coupons and a fry coupon to compensate for our experience on our first visit to Shake Shack. We decided to use them tonight and we had a great experience. My husband got the BBQ burger...I think it was the ShakeMeister? His burger came first and by the time mine came, his was more than halfway gone so I think it's safe to say he enjoyed it. I got a cheeseburger with no lettuce or tomato and it was juicy and cooked perfectly. The fries were cooked well. My husband said crinkle fries remind him of elementary school cafeteria food...after he ate a few he said \"Okay, they cook these a little better than the cafeteria lady\" lol. Our service was great and we were checked on multiple times while we ate. And the good news is, there were no flies and the restaurant was much cleaner. Thanks again, Ben! You made believers out of us. We'll be back!",

The burger was blah, the fries were really greasy and overcooked. I think someone new was on the fryer because it seemed like if I'd dropped a fry it might have shattered. The chocolate shake WAS great and I might go back just for a shake. But I'd certainly not order other food.",

    "text": "A friend told me about a wonderful 'Shroom burger at Shake Shack. I drove pretty far to experience said goodness, first time here. I love DTS, parking was a bit rough but it's always like that. The place was clean and spacious and there was no one in line, so far so good.. I ordered the 'Shroom burger and the host at the register (Andrew) said \"are you sure you don't mean the Shack Stack\"... mind you, it's my first time here so I'm unaware of what a Shack Stack is, but there IS an item on the menu called the 'Shroom Burger which is what I asked for, so I found it odd that he would question my selection. Moving on, I ordered the fries since very few places have crinkle cut and they're my fav. When I picked up my food first thing I noticed (and I'm not a big eater) was the size of the burger... I said to myself \"did I accidentally order a $6.99 slider?\"... The burger was everything I expected and then some as far as taste, the melted cheese with every bite was nice (tho there were only like two bites). I just don't see how they justify the size of that baby burger, it was so off-putting... Have larger options  and charge more (like Smashburger), people will pay.  On to the fries... they looked amazing, I couldn't wait to dig in... when I did, right away I tasted subtle sweetness which I wasn't expecting and honestly didn't like. Also, they seemed like the store-bought frozen ones... Just straight nasty. People know what fresh tastes like....  Honestly, the fries ruined the meal, along with a pesky bully gnat that kept trying to have his way with my food and actually landed in my ketchup.  SMH. Bottom line is I'll never go back. I left hungry and feeling ripped off, not a good feeling.",

But even if you forget and you go up and ask they are really nice and will give you a side.

The person that brought us our food even picked up our trays as we finished. The staff was just so inviting and most likely whenever I visit the Las Vegas strip, I'll be driving out to Summerlin to get my Shake Shack fix.

Service was good ordered the chicken sandwich and fries. Chicken was very dark in color almost seemed burnt or over cooked. Very little flavor and a little dry. Fries were hot but nothing special. Definitely not worth the $10 paid for lunch. Probably not going to try again, can spend half that and get better food somewhere else.",

Me and my boyfriend had ordered a burger each, two fries, and a drink, and it came out more than 20$ lol I couldn't believe the shroom burger or whatever is $10? like what do they put in it, unicorn blood? lol but seriously, Ive only eaten here a couple of times, because I was shopping in DT summerlin and just wanted to eat something real quick. One annoying to me was people who were saving tables when they hadnt even ordered yet....I feel like if youve ordered, THEN you get to sit down and eat. By the time, youre done ordering, more tables will free up. On the plus side tho - I do like how the people working there walk around to see if you need anything or a refill on your drink - gives it a restaurant feel.",

I ordered the chicken shack or something like that. I ordered it without pickles & they forgot to take it off... No big deal. The sandwich was so good!! I don't like burgers so I often opt for the chicken sandwich (& let me tell you, on my first bite, I knew I made the right choice). I also ordered the bacon cheddar fries. Holy moly, delicious! I'm not sure why people complain about the size of the food because everything is so heavy and filling lol.   I also ordered a chocolate cookies & cream, but I didn't really like it. It was WAY too sweet. I had to give it to someone else cos it was giving me a headache. It was good the first couple of sips lol.   Some guy - I think he was the owner or a manager or something - gave our table 2 free bacon cheddar fries! :D best customer service ever!",

I am not a meat-eater, so I opt for the 'Shroom Burger every time (even meat-eaters like my boyfriend love this too). A deep fried portobello mushroom that oozes of muenster cheese. MM.  Don't forget to order your OWN crinkle fries (I say this because they are so simply good, you won't want to share). Not overly salty with a perfect crunch.  And this is the first time I've had room for dessert. After hearing so much rave about their \"concrete custards\", I tried their exclusive 4th or July blueberry cobbler concrete. First bite - OH MY GOD (I said just that, wide-eyed with my hand on my mouth). It's basically custard with a scoop of ice cream, but tasted like a milkshake with broken pie pieces. I aim to try their S'mores and Red Velvet concrete next time around.  There's plenty of indoor and outdoor restaurant room to dine in, or you can take your food to go. All the employees are consistently welcoming and smiley. Such an awesome atmosphere!",

I can't explain it, but it tastes so much better. Maybe it's the potato bun, or maybe it's their secret sauce. I also like that there's variety in their menu. I probably wouldn't order anything else, but what if I wanted a hot dog one day? I could order it!   Their fries on the other hand aren't any better than the ones at In n Out. They're just okay and a little better with cheese drizzled on top.  As for the service, the employees are friendly and there's always someone walking around cleaning the tables up and offering you water while you wait for your food.   Shake Shack over In N Out any day!",

The shroom burger is delicious with the cheese-filled mushroom; it's also vegetarian. If you want more substance, go for the ShackStack (it's basically a shroom burger plus a patty). The shakes are always good. One thing that sticks out from the menu to me is the purple cow float, though I haven't tried it yet.  If you feel like your shake is too thick to enjoy with a burger, they have complimentary water next to the condiments.  Location is convenient, next to the parking lots. Entrance is kind of weird. Use the door on the right when you walk into the vestibule and it takes you right up to the line to order, but be ready to order otherwise you'll be awkwardly standing off to the side while you glance at the menu on the wall!",

We were so excited to try Shake Shack because we've heard a lot of good things about it. But we quickly learned that this was just hype.   I ordered a regular Hamburger with bacon. I order my burgers plain because I like to see just how the burger stands up with minimal toppings or condiments. I found that the burger was tasteless and rather dry.   Wife ordered the Shack Burger and she also chimed in saying that it wasn't great at all.  I had to reach for some pepper to season my burger. With the pepper added, it was somewhat better. However, I was going to put some ketchup in but decided against it. The burger doesn't even look like a burger. It looks like slivered meat.   Another thing to note about this location was that the rubbish cans were overflowing. Nobody cared to empty trash or to take the trays back in. It wasn't even crowded.   I'll skip this next time. Over-hyped and the food isn't tasty at all. At least I can check this off my list of \"to try.\"",

As I have traveled the united states, I could of obtained a better burger from the food stand in Flatbush, NY. As i did not have to pay for the burger, my bill would have been 11.00 plus, which was not worth it at all. Even down to the 50/50 drink was disgusting.

    "text": "My most recent visit at Shake Shack wasn't the least of what I expected out of them. I have visited the location on the strip several times expecting that the service and quality of food would be just as good. That wasn't the case this past weekend. Now I really wasn't in the mood for a burger per say and I was open to trying out something new. My friend and I both decided on the chicken shacks! One of them original and the other just the traditional style. They were offering a new style of bbq bacon fries that sparked some taste bud interest so we went ahead and through a side of those on! Roughly $20 bucks later we were given our buzzer and found a nice spot to sit out on the patio. The timing was perfect and once the buzzer wrong we proceeded to get the food. Now. I know that you can't predict which size chicken patty is going to come out of the bag before you drop it into the fryer however I would like that there would be some sort of consistency on the size of the chicken breast that is ordered. My biggest issue with this situation wasn't just the size of the patty but it was the fact that they chicken was over cooked. I really couldn't understand how an order that consisted of two chicken sandwhiches one was cooked correct and the other was over cooked. My friend brought this to the attention of the person working and really didn't get a very caring response.. more so along the lines of a pretty nonchalant well that's just how it's mad kind of thing. Yikes! If that's how you treat the customers who come and spend good money on fast food then I can easily go to KFC or hell even McDonalds and order a chicken sandwhich.. Without even further arguing we decided that it was a mistake to even give them the benefit of doubt that with this 3-star rating it was actually warranted. Can't say that I'd be back to this location anytime soon. Just left a bad taste in my mouth... literally...",

    "text": "TOSHONNA was sooooo nice on Sunday night! She was super friendly, and when we asked about shakes she recommended a half strawberry / half salted caramel shake. Omgggg this girl knows what she's talking about. It was delicious. 1st you taste the strawberry,  then a little salt, and a caramel after taste. Honestly the best shake I've had since I can remember. I highly recommend it.  I ordered the chicken shack and it was awesome. A bit on the small side, but full of flavor. A man would have to order 2 to be satisfied. My husband and nephew ordered the Smoked Stack Burger.  They said it was busting with flavor and the best burger they've ever had. My husband practically inhaled his Cheese fries, so they must have been good.  If we're ever back in the area we will definitely come back, because it was great. Thank you Toshonna for being so awesome.",

I ordered just a regular hamburger and an order of crinkle fries. It was tasty, but as other Yelpers said a smaller sized burger. My wife went back to get a frozen custard-Desert Crunch-stellation...it was decadent!  Great menu selection & a wall size menu posted on the wall making it easy to read...very spacious & clean dining area with TV's. Attentive service with employees checking up on you & picking up your trash.",

The Shack-cago dog needs a sturdier bun mine got wet from the relish and fell apart. Too little mustard and definitely needed more. The Hotdog itself was very good. Pretty tasty overall and for Vegas I can get my Chicago Hotdog fix. The help is so very friendly and offered me a refill and clean up with my tray! Maybe I'm light on this review?I need to sleep on it. Overall Very Good!",

The service here is great. The guy at the register was very nice and patient with us as we made our order. This location is overall clean. I ordered the Shack-cago Dog, and it was honestly, really good! It has picked peppers on it, which was soooo good! I really felt that I did not need to add any other toppings or condiments. Very good as is.  My husband ordered the 'Shroom Burger, and it was super full of flavor and the mushroom was cooked perfectly. On top of that, they have cheese oozing from it. Schedule your day accordingly for you lactose-intolerant folks! My sister-in-law ordered the ShackBurger, and she was extremely satisfied with her order.  On the side, we ordered something above Cheese Fries. I love their crinkl-cut fries. It pretty much was Cheese Fries with bacon and peppers in it. UGH! This was sooooo good. We ordered it in a \"boat\" so it was enough for all of us to share. I love the cheese they have here at Shake Shack.  Will come back and recommend to friends!",

    "text": "Shop til you drop, and when you do, there's no better recharging fuel that burger, some fries, and a calorific shake to top it off. A meal like this is the True American Dream  I was super happy to find that Shake Shack was still open when the majority of stores at Downtown Summerlin was closed. Hadn't had dinner yet and was in need of a little something before a real meal, so I went with just a concrete and some cheese fries. I had to forego the burger and will save it for another time  Got the Pie Oh My because 1) it's a whole slice of pie blended with ice cream. How innovative and you can't go wrong with such a classic combo. Pie a la mode concrete style! And 2) a fraction of the proceeds go to a good cause!! The Pie Oh My comes with a slice of regional seasonal pie and this visit it was a slice of DEElicious pumpkin pie. The concrete was a little too runny to be considered a concrete but yummy nonetheless!  Fries were fresh fried golden crisp and topped with a Velveeta-esque cheese sauce. I love that fake cheese so this was spectacular. Well worth the extra calories  Yes, Shake Shack has those East Coast prices and is a tad too expensive for what it is. That seems to be the general consensus. When it comes down to In n Out and Shake Shack you already know who's the winner. But I don't understand why this location has the lowest ratings in the Valley. It was pretty clean inside and the employees were friendly, even at closing time. I'll give it a solid 4 stars to bump up their rating a little",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this burger place for awhile now and finally got the chance. We were quite happy with our experience. We got here on a weekday around 2p, so its after the lunch and the place was not crowded at all. You place your order they give you a buzzer and you wait at the table until it buzzes.    I knew I was getting the Shroom burger and a shake, that's all I had been wanting since knowing about this place. My daughter got the Shack burger which is their take on a cheeseburger with their special sauce. I didn't know what kind of shake to get since they all looked good, and so I asked the cashier what he would recommend. He said salted caramel and that's all it took because I was leaning towards that flavor. It did not disappoint! Next time I will try the Marshmallow chocolate chip if its still available as its a limited time flavor.   The Shroom burger came with a warning sticker that it was Hot. It didn't register to me why, because shouldn't all burgers be hot? well, when I took my first bite, I realize why. The cheese that comes oozing out of the middle! I almost burnt my lips off! hahaha! I'll never make that mistake again. Needless to say, I had to let it cool off with a little bit of shake. Once it got to a decent eating temperature I was quite pleased. I like how the portobello mushroom is lightly breaded and cooked crisp. The melted cheese is held in by the breading.   I was a little surprised at the size of the burgers when they came out. To me, they weren't full sized burgers nor were they sliders. It was in between. Like the size of a whopper junior. It was perfect size for me and my daughter and we shared an order of fries which were also cooked to a nice crisp. there was not one soggy fry.  We left here feeling satisfied and also noticed the restaurant had gotten full. Can't wait for the next trip back!",

My kids ordered shack burger, which is your basic cheeseburger but made extra special with shack sauce. Now the sauce is  on the spicier side and my kids are not like me with heat, so was a bit much for them. You can't help but compare their burger with In N Out and of course, we agreed that In N Out is better.   I wanted to try a veggie burger but their only choice was portobello burger. I prefer veggie patty so didn't try their veggie burger.   The cheese fries were good but for the price I felt the portion was small and nothing to wow me.  They also serve beer and wine which I thought was pricy, $7.99 for white and $8.99 for red, I am sorry but that's a bit much for fast food wine.   We tried their featured marshmallow chocolate chip shake ($5.29) which was awesome but it has a whopping 1000+ calories!!! I am thankful when restaurants mention calories on the menu, what an eye opener!   They are dog friendly and even have a menu for your four legged friends :)",

The cashier was so friendly and down to earth it felt like as though my ordering was with an old friend. They take old diner style of atmosphere and have modernized it with wood paneling in all of the booths of the restaurant. The tele's all around are a must with all different sporting events at different angles all over the restaurant. If a guest wants a certain sports event the staff will change it, like last night when the Knights hockey game was playing.  Our shakes were very good, I cannot believe that I have waited this long to try them. I had the twins with me so the two flavors we had were chocolate and twist. The twist is a mix of vanilla and chocolate which could of been more impressive with added extra chocolate, but that was it. The chocolate was very rich and creamy. I was snack type hungry so opted for something light and it was a couple orders of their fries. They were so golden looking that they would of been good enough looking for royalist. The True test of a good fry and shake is if they fast good together and they exceeded this test.",

I knew shake shack is a bit different from other similar fast food burger joints, which was why i came up with idea to come here for dinner.   Located on the northeast end of Downtown Summerlin, good ample amount of seating inside and outside of the restaurant. As known previously, shake shack tends to be on the pricier side as well, but i still wanted them to try it anyway.   My favorite item from Shake Shack is the \"Shack Stack\" which is a cheeseburger w/ a 'shroom burger (crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled w/ melted muenster and cheddar cheese) topped w/ lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce  Cheeseburger always seasoned well along with the ooey gooey filled portobello mushroom is always yummy. Pricey but good.   The more disappointing item was the fries. Nothing had changed but the other two wanted fries, so i got 1 order. Its the wavy cut fries you see at grocery store frozen aisle. Not the best type (in my personal opinion)  I had also gotten a drink too. Something blood orange? ginger? lemonade? Lol I was told by the cashier it was free refill so i opt'ed for a smaller size. After i had finished my first cup, i went up to the counter, and one of the ladies just gave me a new one. We had discussed this and it seemed like a more \"sanitary\" way vs using a \"used\" cup to refill. More preventative measure on cross-contamination i guess. Good thinking !   Overall, nice treat once in a while. Shake Shack is pricey though. Each burger is almost $10 each. For someone with a small appetite, its a good amount. I wasn't exactly still hungry but definitely wasn't near full either. Oh well !",

    "text": "One of my favorite burgers and surprisingly chicken sandwiches too. Put it this way; this is the only place my daughter will finish the entire burger. Now that's saying something.   Looks like a burger you would make in your own kitchen but maybe that's what makes them so good. It's comfort food that reminds you of home. And home is where the food is lol.   The shroom burger is pretty good too but I prefer the regular shack burger and the crispy crinkle fries. The concretes are worth a try too, hope you saved room for dessert.   My only gripe is the service; I always feel rushed with the cashiers. They definitely aren't as friendly as CFA and not as affordable either. Pricey for the size of burger you get so I don't come as often as I'd like to. Other than that, no complaints. Restaurant is always clean and plenty of tables and outdoor seating available. Great location too.",

Their Cheeseburger is as of the quality of a $8 burger at Johnny Rockets, even better. For just $5 you can get a high quality 100% beef cheeseburger that melts into your mouth like none other. If your looking for a burger stop I would definitely recommend the Shake Shack.",

    "text": "I've been to this location multiple times and the staff is always friendly and I always receive my food in a reasonable amount of time.   Now, you can't compare Shake Shack to In N Out or Five Guys. If you love a good cheeseburger, you know they all fall into their own category. And I'll leave it at that for those comparisons.   If you're a first timer, you definitely have to get the shack stack. I don't go for that now - the deep fried cheese filled mushroom is something you must try but I'm definitely cool off of getting a smoke stack or a regular cheeseburger. Yeah - it can be a little pricey but their patties are always good and I've always received a consistent product at this location.    The fries though - not a big fan. I am not a Kringle type of girl and the cheese sauce is not my cup of tea but I still think they're worth giving a shot if you've never been here but for like $4 - I could definitely live without it.   Their shakes are also creamy and thick AF. Bomb - but use a spoon. I like that they have seasonal flavors but I can't finish one on my own. Still gotta get it if you're a first timer. Go big or go home, right?   Not sure if there are soda refills since the machine is kept behind the counter. They do have a couple items for dogs and if you aren't into cheeseburgers, they have hot dogs and a chicken burger too.   All in all - if you love cheeseburgers, you should definitely check this place out and I believe you can now online order if you wanna save some time.",

I've been hearing about Shake Shack for months now and finally decided to try it. OMG! Why did I wait so long to try them??? I love simple burgers. I'm not into all the fancy bells and whistles other places add to their burgers to compensate for the lack of flavor from the beef itself. SS keeps it simple, and boy oh boy is their beef tasty. Thin patties, crispy edges, juicy, and full of flavor. Very simple ingredients, and very fresh. Such a flavorful burger! And the way they stack the ingredients looks like a work of art, you almost feel guilty for eating it. There is one thing that stood above their burgers though, their customer service. I'm not sure if she was the manager or owner or both, but ma'am I applaud your customer service. Truly an amazing burger and experience. I WILL BE BACK.",

We got a cheeseburger shakestack fries and black and white shake.   It was pretty good.  It's not the best burger in the world but it's a upgrade to fast food.  And it's pretty freekin good.  Depends on if you want a fancy burger or not.  The. Shake was pretty awesome.   The fries were quite good too.",

It's a casual dining spot, so you can come here for a quick bite or with a group of friends.   We were actually walking into Public School but since we have been there multiple times we decided to give this place a shot.  This place was SO yummy.  First off, I love ALL- natural beef (no hormones or antibiotics).  I ordered the SmokeShack burger with fries.  The meat was juicy, the cheese was fresh and the bun was soft :) Hungry yet?

Situated in Downtown Summerlin, a location in the dining alcove nearest Red Rock Resort and Casino adjacent Wolfgang Puck, Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken and Pub 702, Shake Shack takes up a significant footprint with indoor and patio seating, the entrance bringing diners face-to-face with a big board of options and the counter with room for queuing.   Pure Meyer in its concept, the non-GMO Buns, antibiotic-free Meats and Organic Produce all showing a passion for quality while also commanding a premium price, ordering at Shake Shack is a streamlined process with weekly Specials augmenting a list of classics plus the recently launched Chicken Sandwich, the prices really no different from Panera or other \"quick casual\" concepts with a five part order totaling just a shade under $34.  Amused by the Calorie Counts, just in case the toll on one's wallet for what is essentially fast-food delivered tableside despite a flashing pager is not enough, it bears mention that Shake Shack has actually designed their food to be \"Instagram Friendly,\" and with each Sandwich presented as if birthed from the wrapper the visual appeal is undoubtedly compelling, though first bites of the ShackStack were far less-so as the melty Mushroom completely overwhelmed an underseasoned Meat patty that really added nothing to the flavor of the Cheese, Sauce and Fungus.  More impressed by the Chick'n Shack, a brined Breast fried golden with a pleasant spice profile that outperforms Chick-fil-a from Bun-to-Bun as Pickles, Herbs and Lettuce all mingle nicely with the Bird, the rest of the afternoon focused on Shake Shack's famous Concretes and Custards, the weekly Blueberry Sweet Corn a lackluster attempt to do something Jeni's has been doing for a decade with a taste not much different from Vanilla with a spoonful of sauteed fruit drizzled over it, while both the Summerlin S'more and Desert Crunch-stellation fared better largely as a result of the Mix-Ins as the texture of the Custard was far less creamy that either CJ's or Luv-It.",

Do yourself a favor and go to Bachi Burger, Holsteins, or In n Out instead. I honestly think Wendy's does it better.  The best item I've had here are the cheese fries which were actually pretty great. The cheese sauce isn't appealing to the eye though. Smokeshack burger was funky. It's basically a bacon cheeseburger with funky sauce and funky peppers on it. It might be pretty great without the sauce and peppers. Chocolate shake was too bitter. Tasted more like a dark chocolate shake instead of a milk chocolate shake. Probably won't come again anytime soon, too many great places to eat in Vegas",

They have ample indoor and outdoor seating. It makes no sense why it's scoring so low. This location lettuce wraps and it's a solid wrap, no sloppy like they hate that you asked them to. The Shack burger is my favorite because I can't eat the breaded chicken sandwich. Last night we came in and the wait was pretty long once we had placed our order. I didn't complain because we were there as a family just chatting away. When I buzzed I collected our food and there was a card for a free chicken sandwich and a free Shake burger, that was cool. How can you not go away happy?",

I'd never tried it before. I thought the food was delicious. This is not a fine dining establishment. It's almost like restaurant quality food with fast food delivery times. This location did not disappoint me at all.   To me this isn't something I'd tell anyone to put on their bucket list. It isn't that \"one of a kind\" joint where you can only get this \"one special food item\". If you're close by I don't think anyone would be upset if someone recommended this place for lunch. Is it worth crossing State Lines to eat? Probably not..it's a burger joint lol. Anyways I try to set my expectations with the type of establishment. This place is very good for what it is.",

The crinkle fries were crispy and served warm. The Shake Shack Ale was a bit warm and not very hoppy. The restaurant wasn't very clean with food remnants and trash scattered throughout the floor. Because this location is anchored to an outdoor mall, the vibe I got was that of an outlet food court. Too bad and no thanks.",

I never thought I would enjoy a chicken dog, but I was wrong.  It tasted like chicken grilled on an outdoor grill and wrapped in a soft potato bun (4 stars). The Chicago style all beef Vienna dogs were split down the middle and then grilled, the taste was also worth going back for another one (4 stars). For desert, I got a blueberry pie concrete custard.  It was ok, but not what I was expecting, there was to much of the dry pastry dough taste.  If it was made with just the blueberries added in, I think it would much better.  Over all, the Shake Shack is becoming one of my regular fast food stops.  They are always quick, clean, and tasty.  I introduced myself to the manager (Daniel) this last visit and even though the place was busy, he took the time to speak with me and talk about the crew.  Great customer appreciation, thanks!!",

The Crinkle fries are good! Not FAB, but good . Their shakes are good too! AGAIN not Gr8, but good and also come in a smaller size so your not SOOO bloated after eating~",

Walking in to Shake Shack the restaurant itself was clean and open, decorated with wooden walls, tables, and chairs.  To get your food you just walk up to the counter to order and then they bring out the food to your table.  Service was fast, friendly, and efficient.  Unfortunately the decor and service were the only things I liked about Shake Shack.     The prices here are pretty steep for a burger joint because the entire menu is a la carte and doesn't include any meal options.  Between my parents and me, we ordered 3 burgers, 1 soda, 2 orders of fries, and 1 of their red velvet concrete desserts all for about $40, which is pretty expensive to me seeing that usually at other nice burger joints the three of us could eat for about $25-$30.  The fries were crinkle cut style, we thought they there were just okay.  All of us thought that the burgers we ordered were a bit more on the dry side and forgettable.  The dessert was overly sweet and nothing to go crazy over.  When it comes to Shake Shack I say save your money and go elsewhere!",

The chicken bites are made from real chicken and not overly battered. They were seasoned just right.   The hamburger was made from real ground beef and not some frozen patty. It was freshly made. The lettuce and tomato were fresh and crisp. No need to look for the burger as it was bigger than the bun.   Great job!!",

    "text": "Shake Shack isn't known for their vegetarian options, but they do have a pretty tasty fried + breaded mushroom burger that's filled, yes FILLED, with cheese. It's delicious and probably more of a heart attack than a regular burger, but so worth it (unless you really do have a heart attack).  As you might guess, Shake Shack is most known for its shakes. I've tried both the black sesame and the cookies n' cream shakes. They're equally sweet and satisfying.  If you need a more poignant experience description, shakes here are pretty much gourmet level.  Fries are also solid, though simple. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, with the perfect amount of salt and clean cuts.   Yay! I'm a fan.",

    "text": "We were here last week. On our arrival the place was not busy at all. I believe it was shortly before 9pm. The person who took our order (I believe it was Manny) was extremely rude. At what point he even rolled his eyes when I questioned the toppings in the hot dogs.   My daughter ordered a strawberry shake. When we received it the cup rim and lid was covered with a gross looking brown substance. At first I didn't even know what it could be, I quickly realized it was probably from an Oreo shake or something. Nonetheless it looked awful, so I decided to let them know. I showed the woman (I wish I would have gotten her name, she was the shortest person there) she said it was PROBABLY part of the an Oreo shake. I questioned how this could be and she said some nonsense about when we get busy we are just doing the shakes... ok whatever that means. She noticed that I was not satisfied so she offered to remake it. She goes to the back and just drops the cup to the other women making shakes. By this time the place got slightly busier, so I expected to wait longer. 5-10 mins later we still had not shake. Our food had been ready at the same time the shake was so we were about done with our meal. I go back to the counter and the same woman who took my first shake goes back to the shakes and starts making mine. And the picture shown below is the condition in which the second shake was giving to me.   Sad to see how people just don't care anymore. My daughter was quite disgusted by it as well that she didn't even finish 1/4 of the shake.",

The burgers are so juicy and shaking with flavor. The fries and frozen custard, (yes, you read right) FROZEN CUSTARD, are must have additions when you are there to try their tasty burgers. If you're wanting something more than their custards then turn them into concretes and give your mouth and tummy double joy. The Red Velvet Rocks and Summerlin S'mores are my favorite. For burgers I can't go wrong with their ShackBurger or their SmokeShack.   The workers are awesome at steering you through their menu if it's your first time. They also give helpful recommendations so your meal is enjoyable.",

The food is decent, shakes are creamy delicious and the price point is higher than the average burger spot. It's a nice place to hang out, enjoy company, play board games and whatnot. As said before, the order process feels a bit rushed but I understand trying to keep a steady flow with the customer traffic so that doesn't bother me so much. However the one thing that is a peeve of mine is cleanliness. This place was loaded with gnats. I have no idea where the gnats are from but I can only suspect that as active as they were, they probably flew everywhere in that establishment and possibly the bathroom. It got to the point that we took our food outside. Very disappointed with our visit today",

I think I would rather do classic fries because I really enjoy their crispness and ridges. The coffee shake to finish it all off is always a must. I always feel so satisfied with the burgers here. I love the flavor and freshness! I saw that they had a local special burger with deep fried pickles and a garlic aioli! Whoa! Maybe next time I'm in town...  Service is pretty quick and food comes out hot! They have buzzers to know when to grab your food.

    "text": "I had some blurry memories about Shake shack from 4years ago when I arrived to JFK and still under the flight coma I stopped by for a hot dog . The only thing I remembered that I was amused by the remote thingies buzzing when your order is ready lol but I had no memory about the hot dog so I asumed it wasnt that great. I was looking for frozen custard places today and Shake Shack came up so I decided to give it another try, and It was a great decision. I can say that is a gourmet fast food place. The burgers were juicy, the temperature was perfect medium well. I had some concerns about the fries because my love for crinkle cuts is ridiculous but I have to say it was perfect. Fluffy and crispy and just seasoned enough to be able to dunk in both of my fav condiments ketchup or custard  I had the Shake Stack and although it was delicious I think it was a little bit too much next time I will rather order them separately but only because the mushroom is overpowering the beef. We also tried the Smoke Shack and that is ! I had the regular fries but next time I will just go ahead and order double down fries  and wont share!  I also had the Summerlin Smore concrete what had huge and I mean HUGE chunks of fudge cookie pieces. It was the best custard I had so far in Vegas and trust me Ive tried a couple of places including one which is an actual custard place and still couldn't reach this level of deliciousness. I read some complaints about being expensive comparing to In-n-out but come on guys, no matter how much I like In-n-out it is just a different league.  If you like to have a delicious burger but you are also in a hurry this is a place to go :)  I also liked the fact that they have complimentary water next to the condiments, and that a busser asked us if everything is fine with our food.",

When on the Strip, we usually don't want to make the trek to New York, New York and neither do Uber Eats or other food delivery services, it seems.   We have friends who live in Summerlin, so it's pretty convenient to come to this location. We've come for a late lunch both times, and the restaurant was nice and quiet. This time around, there was a special for the Shacktober Fest beers - only $10 for the beer and a commemorative stein! Nothing beats that Shack Stack and some cheese fries, mmm.",

    "text": "Whenever I'm in Las Vegas, I always make a stop at Shake Shack, primarily because it seems like all the rage, and folks in Northern California seem to ooh and aah about Shake Shack.  That being said, as many times as I've come, I can't really figure out why it's such a big deal.    The ShackBurger is what I usually default to, and would say it's fine, but nothing particularly special to write home about.  I do like their super soft buns, but the meat patty itself is fairly thin and usually pretty overdone.  Mine was so flat this time that I could peel the edges off.  Strange, as I've never experienced this, even at McDonalds or Burger King.   The fries are too thick for my preference, but every time I see them on other people's table, they always appear perfectly fried, with no brown edges due to over frying at all.  They seem to have perfected this.  Their organic iced tea today was extremely diluted.  I took advantage of their free refills, but all I got was more diluted iced tea.  I think I should've just saved my $2.00+ and just got water instead.  Yes, it really was that diluted, and they added a good amount of ice to the already diluted iced tea, to boot!    I do like this particular Shake Shack location though.  It's an easy stop,  at this Summerlin location with plentiful parking, a friendly staff, and a super pleasant modern interior that's about as fun and relaxing as I've ever experienced in any fast-food joint.  IMO, Summerlin is the best area in Las Vegas, for so many reasons!  Take Note Bay Area Folks:  There will soon be two Shake Shacks coming your way.  One in Palo Alto this Fall, and another to follow in San Francisco.  In the meantime, I'm sure I'll make repeated visits back here.",

Those are the 2 things that I think really set this pace apart from any other burger place.  I mean come on...crispy portobello filled with Munster and cheddar cheese...wow! I've been here a few times now and have always ordered the same thing, the Shakestack burger, fries and fountain drink (or beer depending on my mood) unfortunately I never have space for dessert so I end up skipping the shake and concretes....but one of these days... I took away a star because it can be a little pricey for the size of the burger and I'm not really a fan of crinkle cut fries.  I've had worse crinkle fries but if they had shoestring or crisscut I'd be all over it.  I still continue to order fries anyway because let's face it, gotta have fries with that burger...it's all about balance.   *the mushroom patty is stuffed with hot cheese so take caution when biting into this cheesy mushroomy goodness",

Ambiance of the restaurant here is very nice, especially for fast food, but I was expecting a bit more from the burger.  I had the Smoke Shack, which was topped with red peppers, which had a very nice heat to it.  It would have been better if perhaps the bun was more toasted.  The milk shakes were balanced and not overly sweet.  While I'd come here again, I wouldn't say it met the (overly) high expectations.",

However, I tried this one and did not have such a great experience. Maybe I was just really hungry the other two times. There was a long line (just like my other Shake Shack experiences). The burger was under cooked. It was done on the outside and pink in the middle. I took it back and the guy said \"That's how we do it here.\" He said something about it being safe to eat raw because the meat is pasteurized. WTF?! Done on the outside and pink in the middle means that the heat is too high and the kitchen is trying to turn them out too quickly. They have teenagers on the grill, not chefs. Give me a break. Anyone that has ever cooked for themselves knows the difference. The cheese sauce on the fries did not seem very high-end. Once cooked, the meal was pretty good, but not worth the price. Looking for a good burger and fries for reasonable prices? Stick with In-N-Out.",

We have tried different locations in both East Coast and Las Vegas.   Since we moved to LV, this Shake Shack in Summerlin has been our family's fav go-to burger joint.  My 5 year-old daughter even prefers Shake Shack over McDonald's (McDonald's has toys). We love the doublecheese burgers, fries, chocolate shake with malt and vanilla custard. Their potato buns are just the best.  Burger patties are juicy not oily.   Plus this location has the greatest customer service.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  They come around to greet customers at the tables. And most often they offer to bring the food to you even though this is a fast food, get-it-yourself restaurant.  The restaurant is clean and spacious. It is not like the ones in NYC -- small and crowded.  You will fall in love with it if you give it a try.",

It's really hard to get my husband to try new food, so when I suggested this place he was all for it because how can you screw up a burger and fries? Well you obviously can. The cashier that took our order was Shawtrice she was unhelpful, and seemed annoyed that she was even there. I ordered their featured  burger that was \"roadside burger\" and fries and my husband ordered the regular \"shack burger\" with an add on of bacon and fries with a soda. Mind you the soda comes in 2 sizes small and large and the small is a 12oz cup but you get free refills. But getting up and down to ask for a refill is a little annoying and they give you a new cup each time. Which for sanitary reasons I can appreciate but I feel like just give us the big cups and you wouldn't go through so much paper. Anyway, the food. The actual meat had no flavor. No salt, no seasoning, no anything. The only thing I could taste on my burger was the pickles. The fries were mediocre as hell. Just frozen crinkle fries they deep fried. They don't have ranch to eat with your fries which is fine but annoying to me because I love ranch to dip my fries in. The interior is very modern and stays clean because they have employees roaming around picking up trash and trays. We spend $24 for 2 burgers, 2 fries and 1 drink, and the food left us feeling empty and 30 min later we were hungry again. So if you want to try it go ahead but when a Big Mac from McDonalds has more taste why waste your money.",

While the burger patty itself was good (not great or even above average) the bun was soggy, the lettuce (calling this wet, wilted, disgusting green mass lettuce is an insult to lettuce) had to be removed. The fries tasted like the ones I make at home (from the freezer section of the grocery store). The bright spot for me was the cheese on the fries, that was delicious. My wife got a shake, which was good. Will we go back there again? Maybe. But I seriously doubt it when there are places with much better food and at much better prices. I will take a smashburger over this place any day.",

It came and was so greasy I could not pick it up, and had to use my knife and fork to eat it and the bun was too doughy, One could get a much better hamburger at Carl's called the big burger for only $1.39 and the best milkshake out there.",

My parents were sitting at a table looking at the menu. I have never been there, but my mother had been and said it was good. Usually you order at the counter and pick up when buzzed. This is where they earned their 5 stars. One of the crew members, I believe Mark was his name, came over and asked if we had any ?s. My mother said she had a question about the mushroom burger. Mark answered and then went out of his way to ask if we wanted him to take our order at the table instead of us having to walk up and stand in line( I guess he noticed we all had health issues). It blew my mind. He took our order and brought it to our table like a full service restaurant. The food itself was good, but nothing super special. Would definitely go back for the food. I just felt like I needed to write a good review for the service because it seems like in Vegas, it's very hard to find someone willing to go the extra step to satisfy someone. Usually people only barely put out enough effort to say they did their job. Thank you again, Mark(?) for all of your help.",

She said \"you only ordered one\" so I went back over to the cashier who took our order and I said what happened you took the burger off after you reread the order to us? And she said \"yeah it was a mistake\" ok that's fine mistakes happen I get that ( i have worked in my share of fast food ) the lady next to her said \"so do you want the burger now or...? I just looked her, I said can I please see a manager because now all this other food is going to go cold while we wait for the other burger. She went and got the manager, she came out didn't apologize didn't actually say anything besides \"do you want me to put that burger on the fly for you? uhmm I had to pause and think the fly ? oh yeah i mean i guess we keep talking about it did they think i suddenly changed my mind and wanted to share my burger with my friend? I don't understand why this wasn't addressed professionally and with some type of apology... shit happens I get that we all get that but i didn't remove that burger from my order and to top it all off we ate cold french fries and my burger was cold by the time we got my friends.

    "text": "My wife and I decided to give Shake Shack a try, and needless to say our first visit will probably be our last.  The burgers are way too expensive for what you get and were mostly on the dry side.  The service was below par as well.  My wife order a plain Shake Burger and I had the Smoke Shack, we also each ordered a fries, which are ordered ala carte, and a lemonade.  When our beeper went off indicating our order was ready, I went up to get it and saw that only one order of fries was ready.  The young girl behind the counter said our other was cooking and that someone would bring it out in about two minutes.  Her watch must work differently than mine, because two minute came and went and no fries.  We continued to share the one we did get while we ate and waited for the other fries.  Now we are sitting there with our food completely gone and still no fries.  The whole time the employees we laughing and joking around, just having a grand ol' time.  I finally got fed up and went to get a refund for the fries I never received and as I approached the counter the girl just brought them up.  At this point I just wanted a refund, which I got.  If you like over-priced and over rated burgers feel free to go, as for me.  I'll go elsewhere and spend less and get better.",

We got 2 burgers and fries, and we got to try the hot dog.  To say this food is delicious is an understatement!!  It was fabulous, just burger comfort food to the max.  Everybody there was friendly, the place was super clean, and having a manager make sure that our first time there was a good experience was a major bonus.  It makes a difference when you feel that somebody really cares that you support their business and that you get a good bang for the buck.  The burger buns are soft as silk, the burger meat was cooked perfectly and was delicious!  The hot dog was great too!  You want to get a side of the melted cheese for the fries and dog, worth it.  Trust me.  This place will now be in our lunch rotation.  (We are going back today, we just can't help ourselves!)...",

I love the clean fast casual ambience, quality ingredients (no hormones or antibiotics in their meats), and the location.  The Chick-n Shacks (100% all natural, cage free Deep Fried chicken breast sandwich w/ lettuce, pickles & herb mayo) are a little overrated, I'm not a huge fan but they were just ok as was their crinkle cut fries (just a side note, the fries could easily be shared as one order easily fed my husband, toddler son & myself w/ some leftover).  The fifty-fifty (iced tea w/ strawberry mint lemonade) was way yummy!  We ordered 2 ShakeBurgers, 2 Chick-n Shacks, Fries, 3 Drinks and received a complimentary cup of vanilla frozen custard in lieu of Mother's Day and spent ~$36, pretty darn good considering the quality ingredients used!  I'm a fan.",

I also got cheese fries, I can do without the cheese next time, the fries were good themselves. I also got the salted caramel shake... now the shakes, I can see why the hype, SSSOOOOO GOOD.

We're native Southern Californians so we had to try it in order to compare it to the almighty In-N-Out which, in our humble opinion, is THE Standard against ALL burgers.  Glad to say, we were not disappointed.  I ordered the Shack Stack which was really good.  The peanut butter vanilla shake was also really enjoyable.  The ONLY downfall we could think of is the price.  We can get lunch at In-N-Out for just under $12 (two burgers, one fry, one soft drink, and one shake). Lunch here: $32 (two burgers, one regular fry, one cheese fry, one soft drink, one shake).  Is it worth the price? Most definitely not.  Will we visit again?  Probably.  Is it better than In-N-Out? Hands-down: No.",

As much as I love the food here, I cannot justify spending almost $30.00 for my husband and I on a burger joint when I can spend half of that on something like In-n-Out and have it be about the same quality. Anyway, the food is delicious, nonetheless! & I do like this location a lot better, plenty of (FREE) parking and easy to get to...and I emphasize \"FREE\" parking because almost everywhere on the strip charges for parking now, which is absolutely ridiculous. Although the service was somewhat slow at this location, the burgers are good, but my favorite would have to be the loaded fries and of course the peanut butter shake. Although I cannot say it is fair to compare this place to In N Out (even though I pretty much already did LOL) I do like both burger joints for different reasons, but my breaking point in this debacle is the price, and that's why I'm comparing the two. Overall, I do love Shake Shack, and I like this location MUCH better than the strip. Although it's kind of out of the way if you're just passing through, I'd much rather go to this location just to avoid all the Strip chaos.",

When it opened in Summerlin, we went the first day for lunch. The line was long, but the employees were great. They were informative and very helpful, but the food quality was fair at best. We both ordered cheeseburgers and split the cheese fries. The food was served quickly and it was hot, but it was just blah. The burger had no flavor. The bun was not toasted and also flavorless. Neither one of us finished our burger because it was that unimpressive. The fries were a bit better, but I would much rather have In n Out or Five Guys. Probably will not return as the food quality was lacking.",

If it's your first time there, the wall menu can be a bit overwhelming. The cashier was so nice and helpful he got me through my order. Ended up with the chicken sandwich, regular cheese burger, single order of fries and a single vanilla custard. The sandwich and burger looked pretty good, but man are the small...smaller than in n out. $3 for a tray of fries...crazy! I thought they'd be enough to share, but really. The chicken sandwich was good, a bit salty. My son said his burger was good, but not better than in n out. Custard was good, nothing special. So in my opinion, by the number times I used good to describe it...it was just that.. good. Not delicious, not awesome, not spectacular...just good. For the price and portions I probably wouldn't set out to go there on purpose, maybe if I happen to be in the area.",

The hamburgers would be called sliders in any other resturant in Las Vegas since they are very small. The fries were okay but I think they tried to do a double fry technique on them but were only marginally successful. The inside of the resturant was rented out for a party and when we tried to go in one of the waitress told us we couldn't go in just sit outside at the picnic tables and she would take our order. She never came back. We realized that you had to go inside to order so we did. They gave us a buzzer so we could get our food at the counter when it was ready, but some of the food was being brought out and delivered. We had to go get ours. The staff is very disorganized.",

I've only been to two other Shake Shacks other than this one (one of which is the one in New York New York on the Strip).  Today, I ordered a burger with fries (no cheese) and the vanilla concrete.  The burger, although very good and fresh, seemed to have a soggier bun than the buns that I had at my previous visits to Shake Shack.  Otherwise, the burger was pretty delicious.  I have no idea what that Shake Sauce is, but it is pretty darn good.  The patty was well seasoned and very fresh.   Unfortunately, the fries are nothing to write home about.  They are crispy and tasty, don't get me wrong, but  they are nothing notable.  They taste pretty similar to freezer fries.  The vanilla concrete didn't taste much different from any regular blizzard/freeze/McFlurry like concoction.  A single is pretty small and might not be worth the $3.50.  For fast food, Shake Shack is pretty expensive.  But the burgers are so good and fresh that I always come back!  The service here is very fast and friendly as well.  And a huge plus is that this location is much less busy than the one on the Strip - of course!",

    "text": "Friday night it was time to check out the long awaited arrival of Shake Shack at DTS, I have heard so much about this burger joint through the years from friends who have tried the one in NYC to the recent one that opened in the NYNY Hotel.   When we arrived, we were greeted by an employee who was energetic and excited about explaining the items on the menu. She helped us decide what to order. This was helpful and I decided to order the Shack burger with fries and a chocolate shake! My daughter had the chicken hotdog! I was like Really? They are known for their burgers, but she is slowly moving towards becoming a vegan so...I couldn't say a word.  As I was walking away to find a seat there was a lady stating she was so excited to try their food and hoping it was delicious and I chimed in \"so you can Yelp about it\" and her response was \"Yelping is for cowards\". Excuse me??!!?? I took the higher ground and chose to ignore her obvious stupidity. Ok, on with my review!  They give you a little beeper which lets you know when your food is ready to pick up. We chose to sit outside and it was a gorgeous evening! There is plenty of seating both inside and out but with our terrific fall weather why eat inside? Our food arrived and I have to say it was good not great! My burger was tasty and I liked the special sauce but I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. My bun was really flat and lifeless and although I love crinkle fries they had way too much salt. The chocolate shake was rich and heavy. It was also not blended all the way as lots of lumps.   I understand that they just opened and probably have some training issues to work out. I am going to give them one more try after they have had a chance to be open for a while and work out some of the kinks and hopefully it will be better. I will be open and optimistic on my next visit!",

Maybe it's the melted cheese that you can dip into with fries that has my love, but whatever it is Shake Shack is one of my to gos if I want a more expensive burger. I've only gotten the cheeseburger, but it hasn't disappointed yet. The sauce can be a little on the spicy side so I would definitely recommend no sauce for the littles.  The fries is pretty good alone but you need to get the cheese sauce to dip it in. It's probably not the healthiest, but I like any type of melty cheese that you can dip into. Overall, I like Shake Shack. The price is a bit more expensive but it can be worth it depending on what you like. If you are a hungry hippo, it may just take you 2 orders of a burger to get you full.",

We LOVE the Smoke Shack with cherry peppers and bacon and it never disappoints! The burgers are so juicy and the soft potato bun is a perfect pillow for the burger! We even got to try the new custard flavor: SHACKENSTEIN! (vanilla vistas with a brownie on top!) I decided on the Desert Crunch-stellation with vanilla custard and toffee bits! The texture was so amazing and rich but not overpowering in sweetness and flavor!   Service here is on point! The staff at this location offered samples of new flavors... Advice on beer selections and even seconds with fries when we joked that we needed more to give them an honest opinion - what's the worst that can happen when you ask for seconds right??   Yes, this is a place of indulgence ... And I'm the fitness trainer. I'm also all about the 80/20% lifestyle so we can enjoy foods that are in our city and all in moderation! ..

We got away with two shakes, two burgers and one order of fries for $32.16 which would be $16.08 per person if broken down. Now, while the place is nice, it's not restaurant nice. I note that because a lot of actual (mid-tier) restaurants you get away with a bill like this for two people.   If you are about that bougie fast food life, this might be the spot for you. Because I can definitely vouch for the taste. I just don't know that the quality exactly matches the price tag, in my opinion.",

I also had a strawberry shake.  I ordered fries with cheese for my companion and almost spent twenty dollars.  That was a bit of a sticker shock!    The cheese sauce on the fries was better than most.  It was creamier and had a combination of a couple of cheeses. There still wasn't enough to cover all fries and I found the remaining fries a bit salty.   The shake was good but not what I expected.  My granddaughter drank most of it.There is one fast food place that I can think of that has a better shake than Shake Shack and this was a bit disappointing considering the name of the establishment.    The service was prompt and helpful.  The food is good. My point would be if you want more \"bang for your buck\" you may want to try someplace else in Downtown Summerlin.",

When I tasted their food, OMG... It was sooo good. Til this day, I can't stop talking about how good their food is.  My party ordered:  Smoke Shack Burger $6.69 Regular Fries $2.95 Cheese Fries $3.95 Shack Stack Burger $9.49 Shack Burger $5.19  I actually liked their Shack Burger the best. But, all their burgers are juicy & delicious. I love the burger buns as it reminds me of the Hawaiian bread that I love. And their fries, those were my fav!!! I don't know what seasoning they use, but it tasted so yummy, & they fried them perfectly for me - well done fries that's crispy on the outside.   Although they accidentally mixed up our order, they were very apologetic, and the manager took the initiative to hand deliver our correct order to us. The staff were very helpful as well.  I seriously can't wait to go back... This has actually become my new favorite burger joint!",

The atmosphere is very quite, all you can hear is yourself and the TV. Since it's kind of empty, you have a lot of space to yourself. I do love the location of the restaurant though, because it's in Downtown Summerlin mall and the outdoor designs are so aesthetically pleasing.   * There was this student discount that they having going until July, where it is but one get one free. I ordered the shackstack and my boyfriend got the smoke shack (or smoke stack, I forgot, whoops). These burgers ooze out flavor. It is so amazing but it also oozes out oil; like lots of it. My boyfriend thought that the meat was very tender and juicy, but the burger fell apart quite easily. Very hard to handle and keep clean.   * Like I said, there was a student discount from Mon. - Thur. Until July. I recommend going there for the buy one get on free burger if you're a student. It's a quite deal. You basically only pay $7-$9  * Boyfriend Rate: 7/10 * My rate: 8/10  * Price: $",

On the rainy Friday I went to the Shack here in Vegas, there were no lines but plenty of crowded tables, mostly filled with teenagers.  I got two Shackburgers and an order of fries to go, which I split with my husband at home. He liked the burgers more than I did. To me, they taste like a combination of In-N-Out and Steak and Shake. I love both of those burgers, but they are bigger and are more reasonably priced than the $5.39 burgers here. And I was not a fan of the doughy potato roll. But I do like the crinkle-cut fries here better than the ones at either of the aforementioned spots.  Maybe the \"Shake\" part is what drives the Shack's popularity. But I'm not a big shake fan, so I'll never know. And when it comes to burgers, I think I'll stick with the Double Double.",

    "text": "It's nice to have Shake Shack in the neighborhood! I, for one, love Shake Shack, but I'm not crazy-impressed by it either.  Food is great! The 'Shroom burger is their vegetarian option with a crispy and juicy portobello patty. The vegetables taste fresh, and there's gooey, melty cheese that oozes out as you take bites from your palm-sized burger. Some may find it's size relatively small, but I think it's a healthy portion.  A burger, a side of fries, and a milkshake is a good combination that will satisfy the average sized person! If the portion were any bigger, I would feel unhealthily full! (Psst! You know exactly what I'm talking about! It's that, \"I just got hit by a truck\" feeling after gorging on junk food!) And side note, I love cheese, but I definitely prefer the fries without it. If this review were based on food alone, I'd give it a solid 5 stars!  Now, why is it a 4 and not a 5? Well, I was put off by the customer service, which is indeed essential for a prime dining experience. The place just opened, and I understand they need to work out some kinks, but I didn't enjoy the atmosphere of the place either. The walls do not absorb enough sound, so the noise levels were a little high for my sensitive ears, and it pales in comparison to the more spacious Strip location. These are the reasons why it is a 4-star overall rating from me.  Also! I've noticed others mentioning the price... I expected that and accepted it, as I've been to Shake Shack before and understand that it needs to maintain the image of a more \"upscale\" fast casual restaurant (which also explains the trendy, industrial decor).   Overall: Shake Shack is definitely my choice for a burger treat! I can always take my burger outside in their nice little patio :-)",

They all kept holding the door for the guests, personally handing them the menus, and just making you feel like your first time experience there is a great one!   Now on to the food, my BF and I ordered the ShackBurger and the SmokeShack. ShackBurger was superb; it was so juicy, cheesy, and delicious that I even considered getting a second one cause it was that good! The SmokeShack was good but the cherry peppers made it too sweet for my liking.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was really nice! They have an outside patio where my BF and I enjoyed our meal since we had our puppy with us. One employee was even nice enough to give our pup a Shake Shack dog biscuit! He gobbled it right up. We thought it was so sweet for her to do that!   Definitely recommend this place if you want to enjoy a delicious a antibiotic-free, hormone-free burger with a wonderful atmosphere and excellent customer service! :)",

I placed an order and when I got up to the counter I had found out after a couple minutes that our order was given to another customer by accident. Edith and Jeff apologized right away then made us a new order and not only that Jeff came up to us and apologized again and gave us a refund of the total amount and also gave us 4 free coupons for a burger. I was completely impressed with their customer service and the way they handled it. Not only that, we didn't even complain or get the slight bit upset with the mix up and they still went above and beyond to honor customer service. Kudos to that crew there!! We will be back very soon!! Awesome job!!",

    "text": "Located in Downtown Summerlin, comes Las Vegas, Nevada's second location....only after its New York-New York Hotel & Casino location. This Burger & Shake joint hails from New York, a well known spot where customers line up for a bite to eat regardless of how long it is.  The place is very dapper, hip, with a contemporary classic modern twist. It's simple, not too flashy, but most importantly clean.  Restrooms are pretty clean as well with a stainless steel appeal! ...And on the real...The place just recently opened up a couple weeks ago....so cleanliness should be expected...lets hope they keep it that way.  TV's surround the upper wall ceiling for a casual feel. Wife and sister in law and I came during an off time on a Sunday afternoon, around 3pm, so this place was not crowded at all, plenty of seating to choose from and the line was minimal. That being said the location does boast an outside seating area to match its indoor seating...weather permitting. However, expect this place to be packed during peak hours, lunch and dinner especially on weekends. The good news is that Downtown Summerlin hosts plenty of restaurants and eatery joints with more opening soon, so it does help spread foot traffic from all those hungry shoppers.  Menu choices do contain a variety, but not as much as far as burgers go. They do offer hot dogs and simple yet crinkle fries with shack cheese. Shakes & thick creamery delicacy serve up to those sweet tooth looking for something to go with the delicious meal. Regular drinks come on the smaller side, but they offer free refills, actually when you do refill the drink, they give you an entirely new cup! (How bout that?)   Staff were friendly, helpful and did provide a better experience. Found the staff to be plenty and in full force. So with a crowd coming in, looks like they were prepared to battle it out.   All in all, our overall experience was excellent. Everything from service to ambience to food was on par. Burgers were juicy and on point, maybe not the healthiest, but it sure does hit the spot. I do recommend checking the place out to blanket your pallets with a mouth watering juicy and flavorful burger. You won't be disappointed.",

Plenty of customers but the service was quick and extremely friendly. We were a group of 4 and our food was out in under 5 minutes with a steady line half way to the door.   First off, the burgers are a little on the simple side but the meat inside really shines. You can distinctly taste the level of quality in their meat. Well cooked, seasoned, and put together. Now I wasn't overly impressed by the fries, however the simplicity of the crinkle cut spuds well matched the shack's relatively basic burger offerings.   On to the shakes.. Now this is where they really impressed me. I tried the brownie batter (shake of the week), and my son, the strawberry. Both were impeccable. Flavor, texture, you name it.. all exactly what I was hoping for. Overall we were all thoroughly pleased with our visit and will without a doubt visit again.",

Staff was friendly and helpful. The line had 5 people ahead of me but moved quickly due to multiple people taking orders. Menus are available at the entrance so that you can review while in line. The double Shack Burger was juicy and tasty. All burgers are prepared medium unless you specify other wise. We requested an order of sauce on the side and found it was nothing special, not much flavor. The fries are great, not greasy or salty. There is a lot of competition in Downtown Summerlin for dining and Shake Shack is another one on the list. Glad we waited for the Summerlin site as a special trip to the strip would have been disappointing.",

I asked the cashier which flavor shake she liked most and enthusiastically made conversation and recommended something I not only didn't notice, but totally loved: a Cookies and Cream shake.   Three televisions all on different channels, perfect for kids, parents and adults of all ages. The staff was so friendly and eager to help from the moment we walked in.

    "text": "So many fucking haters on Yelp. If something comes in with a huge reputation, it seems like so many are eager to tear it down. When you review a spot, you should go with an open mind. Blank slate...like if you were the first one to review a new joint that nobody knows about. That's a True reviewer!  With that being said, the shake shack in Dt summerlin was as good as I expected. Met with a friendly greet. Cashier asked if we needed recommendations. Place was clean and staff was eager to give the guest right-of-way and politely held open doors. Burgers were consistent to what I had in Madison Square Park. Strawberry shake was thick AF and tasty. Crinkle cut fries aren't my fav but good enough. Probably won't get cheese on them again-personal pref.  How the hell can this be only a half star above Crave? This spot at least tries and should deserve at lowest 4 stars.",

I'm not going to hate on Shack but it was definitely somewhere below the hype that builds up its rep. At the Downtown Summerlin location the ambiance is awesome. We are talking about a burger joint where you order and sit down, but it definitely has a clean feel and trendy look.   The burgers were good. Nice portion too, staying away from an oversized portion. Ingredients were fresh from the bun to the tomatoes. Fries were crinkled and crunchy. (None of that soft, high school cafeteria, baked and flaccid fry.) Ketchup was good and they gave me a side of awesome sliced pickles without charging me and with a smile, no less.   The difference between church-goer and cult follower comes down to a few things for me. We tried the shake and the custard. Not bad, but not great. We've had better, smoother custard and places like Freddy's. And the shake was just ok too. Not bad, but probably won't be a crave-inducing shake. The burgers are good. But they are in the Smashburger category. Similar buns, similar patty and similar ingredients.  I'd recommend the place and have no reason to steer people away. Just putting this place somewhere below the hype.",

Yeah, Shake Shack offers all of that. But it comes at a price that borders on being ridiculous.   My first visit ended up with an order that got messed up. Want a drink refill? It was a bit of a pain to get one. And at that price point surely they can direct someone on their staff to empty the dang trash cans. Sure the burgers are fresh and flavorful. But when you pull out your debit card and get the total, then look back at the cost after you finished your meal it comes across as seriously overhyped and way overpriced.   It's worth trying once or twice, or if you're in downtown Summerlin and are craving a good burger it's an option to consider. But otherwise, I think I'll keep looking for better burgers elsewhere as Shake Shack just ain't all that.",

My first experience with Shake Shack was at the location on the strip and it was underwhelming to say the least. I had ordered the double burger the first time around and could not fathom how anyone could enjoy paying $10+ for such a mediocre burger.   This time around I ordered the Shack Stack Burger and I was once again disappointed. The burger came out to almost $10 and I was still fairly hungry when I left. The  \"shroom\" that they put in the burger looked like it would add a substantial amount of mass to the burger, but the moment you bit into it, it flattened and became almost non existent. Not only that, I couldn't even taste the mushroom.   After trying two different locations of Shake Shack, I cannot justify coming here anymore. You pay high prices for mediocre burgers, that don't do much to satisfy your hunger.  Honestly, gather together a few extra dollars and go check out Bachi Burger. It is MILES ahead of shake shack for slightly more money. You'll thank me later.",

It sounded really good so we wanted to give it a try! This was our second time here, so we thought it was going to be just as great as the first. But we were wrong! When we got up to order the cashier, I believe his name was jheroll (at least that's what my receipt says) he came off extremely rude to us. Everything was okay in the beginning, I ordered the chick n bites with honey mustard, fries and a small drink. Then when I asked for the peanut butter bacon burger he acted weird and said \"there is no peanut butter on this premises\", then proceeded to laugh at my boyfriend and i's face like we were dumb for asking if we could get that burger (as if we didn't know if they could make it or not because it was our first time asking for it). My boyfriend and I looked at each other and we were like \"uhm okay that's fine\" and we instead ordered a single shack burger. Now don't get me wrong, the food was phenomenal regardless of not getting what we came there for, but the 1 star review is for the counter attendant who treated us like we did not know what we were saying. He made us feel dumb and embarrassed. Definitely not a place I would come to again. I'm very big on customer service and that encounter made me never want to step into that restaurant again.",

The onions cannot be grilled. $6.99 for a bland burger? The fries are not salted either. I tried looking for signs of salt crystals but my beedy little eyes didn't detect any. The best part of the burger is the bun. Its like a soft Hawaiian bun. The patty was cooked to the right consistency and not over cooked. The apple pie shake was good and tasted like apple pie. Next time I'll stick with 5 Guys on the other side if I want a burger. Shake Shack. They must've shook all the seasoning out of their food.",

I wish that they just had grilled onions and it was not mixed with bacon. That would be amazing.  The cheese fries with peppers are the best. I normally have to share these but I am pretty sure I could eat the entire bowl myself. They are that good.   I have never tried the custard but it looks delicious.

    "text": "This Shake Shack is located in Downtown Summerlin. Inside was clean and the guy who took my order was really nice. The wait to order and get my food wasn't terrible considering they were supposedly making it fresh and they were busy. They have seating inside as well seating outside seating on the patio which is dog friendly.   Chick'n Shack ($6.59) -  Crispy chicken, lettuce, pickles and buttermilk-herb mayo. My sandwich had both leaf and shredded lettuce, odd. I have to say that I really enjoyed the taste of this much better than the one I had at the other location. I did ask for extra mayo this time and it made a huge difference. I ate every bite and can only hope that if I do stop by for one of these again in the future that it will taste just as good.  Hot Dog ($3.39) - Advertised as flat-top dogs, these hot dogs are sliced down the middle and cooked on you guessed it, a flat-top grill. I added Shack Cheese Sauce for $.50 cents more and that still didn't cover up the not so great taste of this dog. One side was charred way too long and the other was just right. The potato bun was tasty, but this hot dog was just lacking many things.   Shakes ($5.29-$5.79) - They have soda, water, beer and wine, however we chose to support No Kid Hungry and purchased $2 shake coupons and had shakes with our meal. I was excited to try the Coffee Fair Shake, but it was a real disappointment. The coffee shake tasted like a Jamocha shake from Arby's, but with less flavor. My hubby ended up getting the Peanut Butter shake and it tasted very good! I bought a few of the $2 shake coupons, so I decided to go back and get a peanut butter shake and was so glad I did.   The fries here are just average in my opinion. I honestly prefer Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken located right across from this Shake Shack because I get a better portion for my money. The burgers here at Shake Shack are too damn small. A double shack burger will set you back $8.19 before tax, drink or fries and let me mention that's for a burger with just lettuce, tomato and sauce. I can get a double double at In N Out Burger for $3.45 before tax, so I just don't get what's going on here at Shake Shack. If someone wanted to come here I'd join them and most definitely I'd go with the chick'n shack, but can't see coming back on my own. One cool thing is there's an outdoor patio with tables/seating and it's dog friendly.",

I normally get the smoke shack and cheese fries, I will say the cheese fries are way better in the restaurant then when you order them on postmates. The shakes are great too, esp the apple pie shake but it's only a seasonal shake.",

Located in downtown Summerlin this Shake Shack is so clean and the staff is really on top of things. Menu has a decent variety and is pet friendly meaning they actually have desserts for  your fur friends. Clever and cute little touch might I add. Super friendly service when taking our order which always makes my meal start off on a good note.   Next the guy (Matthew)going around making sure everything was clean by wiping off tables, sweeping etc. was super friendly as well making a point to clean tables off with a separate,  and NEW wet wipe every time!!   I watch this stuff my friends so you don't have to ;).  Food comes to our table the presentation looks good, however we all know that looks can be deceiving. I'm here to tell you that it not only looked good but,\" Oh My Gosh\" it tasted even better! So yummy it should be a sin. The buttery bun, the crispy batter -that hugged my chicken cooked perfectly might I add, was just absolutely delicious. Others including husband, reported their burgers to be so delicious as well, that we have decided to come here again for our next Saturday \"lets not cook day!\"  Best $40.06 spent on a splurge \"QUICK\" dinner for 3 in a long time.  Kudos staff at Shake Shack you guys are doing a fantastic job please keep up the good work!! Shake Shack Is AWESOME!! :)",

A single isn't very filling. Overall it's an overpriced 4 star joint.",

The crinkle cut fries go well with the special \"shack\" sauce. I have eaten at Shake shack numerous times and the fries are always hot, crispy, and tasty. On to the Shakes, they are superb! There is a reason Shake is in the title. While thoroughly decadent, my wife and I love the salted caramel shake. The chocolate shake is another delicious choice.  Regardless of what you order, if you are in the Summerlin area this is a great spot to stop and grab a bite before an Aviators game or a movie. Swing by and check it out - you will be glad you tried it. One drawback is the absolute lack of cell service, must I really be relegated to using your wifi?",

    "text": "UPDATE: after getting assistance from corporate, I decided to try Shake Shack Summerlin again. The cashier seemed a bit unhappy, but I'll chalk that up to being busy. Also, she might have been new, because she seemed a bit confused. All good though! I received my food quickly (with everything in it), and it was SO GOOD. I'm very happy with my second experience!  Also, I got a Poochini for my pup; it was so cute, and my pup loved it! It has custard, peanut butter, and a Shake Shack biscuit.   I'm so bummed. I love Shake Shack a ton. BUT, the last time I went (this past Sunday), they forgot to put my bacon cheese fries in the bag (app order). Things happen, so okay. I decided to call because that's $5, and I wanted my fries. I left a message with the 'manager' (just an answering machine), and the prompt said they would call me within 24 hours. I never got a call.   The food was great (what I got of it), but I'm really disappointed in their customer service on the manager's end. I'm not sure if I'll go back to this location, just because I'm irked the wrong way by the lack of call. Again, super bummed.   Picture of my dog with the Shake Shack water bowl (the staff was very friendly and helpful! Thanks for that)",

I think I love the fact that there is always this lady who come around asking if we need anything like forks or water. I always forget to ask for her name but she's wonderful. There's a lot of space to sit inside and some seating areas outside as well. They have great options if you are can't decide whether you want a chicken burger, beef or vegetarian. I tried their chicken hot dog here and it's pretty good! I can't complain. I always take family to this location because it's closer to home and not as busy as the strip. My mom tried their bacon burger and so did my cousin. It must be really good because my cousin totally finished it in a blink of an eye. Like literally!! I was surprise so that means she liked it. Cheese fries are probably my favorite style fries because I love cheese! If have to update this post the next time I go there. They have your self serve water, condiments and utensil bar after you order. Beers on tap. Delicious shakes! Can't go wrong with a simple vanilla. It's perfect on those hot summer days.

I know a lot of people talk about this place being pricey and that In-N-Out has better burgers, but all in all, Shake Shack is not all bad.  I don't crave for burgers that much, but their veggie (portobello mushroom) burger is really good. That and their cheese fries are the main reasons why my fam and I come here. Sometimes it seems like they don't put enough cheese on the fries, but I'm pretty sure you can request for extra. I don't see why not.  One of their specialties is the frozen custard ice-cream called a Concrete. I highly recommend this menu item if nothing else seems to be striking out to you.  They have a lil menu for dogs too if you happen to bring the furry friend along. My dog taste tested all the treats and loves them!  If you're in the area, give this place a try. Plus you can go shopping right after since this restaurant is located in Downtown Summerlin!",

I asked what the difference between a concrete and shake was and they just said the concrete is thicker and had stuff in it (recess cups or whatever depending on what you ordered). It's not a shake at all, it's a sundae.  The food was very pricey. I paid about $20 for the 3 items and the portions or pretty small. The burger was okay, nothing to rant and rave about. The sundae was really good actually but came out all melted, and the fries were decent and you got a decent amount.  The customer service wasn't to great, the food was mediocre, and the presentation of the food was really bad. The burger was falling apart and the sundae was all melted.",

It's crispier and more to it than chick fil a... fries are just fine- nothing special- but the cheese sauce is yummy!

Shake shack is not an on the go burger.  I hate to say this but the more I've had it, the more I prefer it to some California chains. The eggy bun is so tasty! Charred beef! Cheese fries! (Although I do prefer fries at other said California chain better). This place is made to order so often food can take some time depending on how busy they are. Also they have a rotating menu among their usuals so that gives you a new experience every time. I need to try their Pie Concrete because the pie mix in comes from a Brooklyn Bakery!   If you want a good sit down experience, have time to chat and watch tv, and want decent burger quality, check this place out with an open mind.  I still like the other place.. and have my cravings for it.. but I've eaten at Shake Shack more often in the last year than other place.",

    "text": "5/5 because Shake Shack always knows how to satisfy my belly! The Smoke House Burger, Loaded Fries (don't forget to request some cherry peppers!) and some amazing frozen custard. I always enjoy checking out the special flavor of the week. Also, I'm pretty picky when it comes to milkshakes, but this place does them right. They've never lost any flavor, they're very rich and thick.   This location is great because it's never going to be quite as crazy as the one on the strip. That means shorter lines and shorter wait time! Also, the service is very friendly and helpful!",

    "text": "The first time I came to Shake Shack, I didn't like it. Ordered their Hot Dog at the time, which was tasteless and horrible. Seriously, a hot dog from a movie theater tastes better than the one from here! I didn't come back for a while, until my husband later heard from some friends that the chicken sandwich was very good. So I decided to try the Chick'n Shack on my next visit and I loved it!! This is honestly one of the best chicken sandwiches that I have ever had. The chicken is always juicy and not overcooked. My usual preference is no mayo in any of my sandwiches, but their buttermilk herb mayo was pretty good. Also, unlike the Hot Dog, the Chicken Dog here is awesome and packed with flavor. I have always been a fan of crinkle cut fries and usually order the cheese or the bacon cheese fries.  Although the food here is expensive, customer service is top notch! There is always an employee walking around the dining area, asking how the food is tasting, offering to get a drink refill for you and taking away trays and throwing the trash away. They also clean up the tables in a timely manner, which is great because at other fast food places, you sit down in the restaurant and find oil, crumbs and other trash on and near your table.   Other than their Hot Dog, the only other thing that I don't like about this place is that they give you a buzzer while you wait for your food. I'm sorry, but those things have a lot of germs and who knows how often they are sanitized! Will be back again soon!",

A little over priced then you would pay for fast food but it's completely worth it because of how fresh the ingredients they use are. Meat taste great, fresh lettuce and tomatoes.! I never feel horrible after having a burger and fries from here.  Recommended items: SmokeShake Burger or Shake Shack burger on a Gluten-Free bun (for an extra dollar more) and the Cheese Fries. Burgers are small looking but definitely filling. \"Don't judge a book by its cover!\" Don't forget dessert; Shack Attack (frozen custard) it's a spot you have to try at least once.",

The burgers are not enormous and not greasy. The options are easy and pretty predictable but in a good way.  When I am craving a burger I will indulge on occasion especially if I am wanting some cheese fries, I have to admit the old wives tale \"once on the lips, forever on the hips\" rings thru your head while you devour these but they are yummy.  I have only had a shake here once and I chose the chocolate malt and it was an 8 out of 10...  I have grabbed a bite here a couple of times, it is out of the way for a quick grab so it seems more of a dine in place if you are shopping in the mall. It makes it a little difficult compared to the ease of other places with drive thru or easier take out options available .  Just sayin.  Great burger and worth the wait especially if you have been shopping and want a good bite for lunch.",

Yes! their stores are modern and sleek.  No! the food is not good.   No! they are way over priced.  Their burgers a tiny tiny.  I'm a skinny Asian guy and thought that I needed at least 2 burgers for it to be considered a meal.  They use a heavy potato bun and a pretty boring piece of patty. Their burgers are also fairly expensive - it was $17 for 2 basic single burgers and one shake.  At that price, I can go to In-N-Out and get four burgers that are spectacular.  I can now say I've done Shake Shack, but there's no reason for me to go back.",

There was hardly any cheese in my shroom burger and it was slightly cold. It alsmot seemed like they forgot the cheese. I thought maybe it all need up at the bottom when I took my first bite but nope there was hardly anything on the bottom. The bacon cheese fries were ok they could have been better if they were warmer. They chocolate peppermint shake was amazing it taste just like a thin mint girl scout cookie. The shake was the best part of the meal.   I guess I need to head to NYC cause this experience was not the best. Not sure I will be back to the Vegas location.",

The SmokeShack burger's pickled cherry peppers adds a nice tangy flavor to the burger. A welcomed change compared to typical bacon cheeseburgers. I like that they add a regular slice of pickle to it as well in addition to the lettuce, onions, and tomato.   The ShackStack burger has both portabello mushrooms with a beef patty and cheese. Nothing special to be honest but still good. We probably won't come here regularly but we had been looking forward to trying it out and we're glad we finally did.   The cheese fries are typical crinkle cut fries smothered in a bland cheese sauce. Decent but again, nothing special.",

    "text": "Skip this place! After reading the reviews last night, I thought perhaps people were too picky and we're giving too hard a report of this place. So I went with an open mind.  I liked the look of the place. It had a promising feel that I thought would turn out some artsy creative burgers. NOPE!  After spending close to $90 on a family of five, I was expecting rather great food. My shack burger had bacon which helped make it edible. Basically imagine a cheeseburger from Mc Donald's. Add some bacon. Add some red peppers. That's it! Gross! No FLAVOR! the fries were tasteless. The beer was ok. I ordered a pint. Definitely not a pint size.  Save your caloric intake for something much better, please!",

Not even worth taking the time to discuss them. Trendy idea designed to be mass produced. I had to go back up and confirm the coffee milkshake was actually a coffee milkshake because its tasted like an ordinary chocolate shake.   I understand why the hip crowd like this place. It was very well designed, clean and the staff was friendly. The game was on multiple tv's and the staff stopped by our table a few times to check on us.",

Had to order another to fill me up.  The burgers were way too small, even the doubles. This is more like kids size. If my 9 yrs old had 2 of the regular cheeseburger (he's a skinny kid), then the burgers here are kids size. $90 for 5 people is a bit steep.   The staffs were nice though. Clean restaurant. Just doesn't make up for the ridiculous size in portion and costs. The burgers are not made of top quality wagyu and should not cost this much. I don't care if it's non gmo either. I used to work for a 5 star fine dining restaurant on the strip so I know my beef. For that size, it should be a $5 burger. Would not come back even if u bribe me with free meal.",

My first Shake Shack was in London, England...not even in the USA! I haven't had Shake Shack since June 2014, so I  was very much looking forward to the Yelp Elite Event to check it out!  Try the classic cheeseburger, some cheese fries, and an IPA. You truly cannot go wrong with that combination. Some compare their fries to In-an-Out. I think Shake Shack wins hands down. I would take their fries every day.   The frozen custard was the only thing that could've been improved on. I didn't think mine was the best in terms of presentation and taste. But, my prior experience with Shake Shack won't influence the rating on that!  There is tons of parking at Downtown Summerlin. You may have to walk a bit, but it is so worth it. They have a nice little patio as well!   Will keep coming back!",

After living in CA with all the amazing fresh selections for burgers - I find Shake Shack to be pricey compared to other gourmet burger joints I've been to.  The fries seemed to be over fried. They were too crunchy where there wasn't much moist potatoes inside to taste. Thought I liked the shroom burger before but this time it just tastes like a over fried mushroom with cheese. The shake my nephew got was tasty but nothing different or spectacular.  Ehhhhh... Don't think I will come back.",

Both patties had a very nice char from the flattop grill. The melted cheese and the chopped red peppers were a nice compliment along with bacon. The bacon was real bacon not the so thin slices places like Red Robin use. The fries we're perfectly fried. Our boys ordered two shakes. Who knows what the butterfat content might be, but such a great flavor and mouth feel. Still think it is overpriced but I could not say a bad thing about the food or the very nice people working there today.",

The one thing I don't understand is all of the people that compare this place to In 'N Out. They are different price points, different levels of quality and completely different business models. I just don't get it.   I love Shake Shack's Smokeshack burger, it's delicious. A bit pricey, but the flavor is amazing. Their crinkle cut fries are great. I usually hate crinkle cut fries - theirs are actual the first ones that I've tried that I like! Their wines and beers on tap are pretty good (and I was pretty skeptical) and their seasonal salted caramel hot chocolate was amazing. I am super picky about hot chocolate (no way in hell I would drink that chemical-tasting packaged crap) and theirs was SO good.   The service at this location is great. I've even been comped fries before with a burger for no reason. The food comes pretty fast, the restaurant (including the bathroom) is very clean, and everything about this location is better than going down to the strip!",

Walked in and there was no line. Loved the decor, this place has a cool ambiance. The menu was pretty extensive. Since it was my first time here I kept it simple and ordered the double shack cheeseburger, fries, and a strawberry shake. My bf got the double burger with bacon and red peppers, fries, and a chocolate malt. The cashier was very friendly and informative when it came to our questions. Our order was over $30...somewhat high for burger place. But I do like that they use hormone free meats...  Didn't take very long for our food to be ready, which was a plus. My burger was awesome. I got extra sides of the shack sauce to dip my fries in. Loved the crinkle fries, perfect mix of crispy outside and soft inside. Only downside was that I really wished they had ranch. I love ranch with my fries...but what can you do. My bf really enjoyed his burger and thought the peppers perfectly complimented the meal.  My strawberry shake was delicious, I wish it was bigger! My bf wasn't too impressed by his chocolate malt. He thought mine was better. We are big Luv It fans so we're picky when it comes to custard shakes.    Overall everything was good. The price was a huge turnoff, if I ate alone it would be almost $20. And I wasn't too happy about there not being any ranch. This is definitely a place worth trying.",

The manager on duty came out and explained to us that they were closed for Easter early, even though the answering machine didn't indicate that.   We were annoyed and we'll go back but FYI they close whenever they want and if your driving from across town you might want to call and actually talk to a person, because they close at random hours.

My husband wanted to check this place out so here we are again. Final verdict:   The food is pretty good but the prices are a bit high. $5.99 for a small hamburger $2 extra for an extra patty and the drink size for a regular is more of a small which they fill with ice (not a fan of the waisted space technique). I love the butter bun they serve with their hamburgers! Crinkle fries are nicely salted and soft. The shake I had (strawberry malt) was just okay. The chicken dog is not impressive, bun and dog. We ordered two single patty hamburgers, 2 drinks and a chicken dog for about $25... Yikes. These prices will keep us from coming back which is a shame.   The tables are recycled wood which is awesome! I suggest having a refillable soda area accessible to customers and lowering their price points with added drink sizes.",

But, a few hours after eating I got sick, and it's pretty obvious that I now have food poisoning. I'm usually hesitant about pointing the finger when it comes to food poisoning, but my boyfriend looked up the reviews and noticed two other customers already mentioned undercooked food and people getting sick. I think it's safe to say something isn't up to par here and the food is making customers sick.  ***Update***  My boyfriend was so pissed about me getting sick that he started researching Shake Shack and found quite a few disturbing articles related to food poisoning, including this one:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Farticle%2F3147046-could-this-be-shake-shacks-worst-nightmare&s=b1255bd4a293aab091b5b992600782ff198d0eba1a20f9ae58c94701a556da3d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">seekingalpha.com/article...</a>  The article explains that Shack cooks their burgers to medium versus well done, which greatly increases the risk of spreading food-borne illnesses to consumers. I'm not saying that Shack doesn't obey all laws and regulations, but I do believe this is why myself and so many others are getting sick, and it's something people should know before deciding to eat there.",

This is probably what stuck out to both of us. $20 for 2 smallish burgers and smallish fries is not going to cut it.  Overall the food is a 3 stars, but the value is only 2 stars.

I got the Shroom burger (it's a fried mushroom stuff with cheese, a vegetarian option) and a red velvet concrete. The burger was nice and cheesy and the concrete (frozen custard with pieces of red velvet cake in it) was absolutely amazing. I also split fries with my boyfriend, who enjoyed his cheeseburger and peanut butter shake. Fries were a bit undersalted, but still pretty good.",

    "text": "Really good burgers which must be compared to In N Out and Five Guys to give the right perspective.  I grew up in CA and instinctively am biased against Shake Shack in favor of In N Out so this review hurts a little.  Quality of Meat: Shake Shack - In N Out - Five Guys (from best to worst) Shake Shack the easy winner here.  Juicy on the inside and cooked at high enough heat to get some charring on the outside.  A really solid patty you wouldn't have an issue with if you paid $15 at a steak house for(besides expecting a bigger patty).  Five Guys, to me, has the worst meat.  It's bland and cooked at lower heat so there's nothing happening on the outside.  In N Out has some charring but the patty is too thin and not juicy enough.  Quality of Bun: Shake Shack - In N Out - Five Guys The Shake Shack bun is awesome. Soft and pliable.  It lets you bite down into your burger without all the toppings flying everywhere.  That's a problem Five Guys in particular has and to a lesser extent In N Out.  In N Out does toast the buns....I couldn't tell if Shake Shack did but definitely didn't taste the toast like you do at In N Out.  Still.....have to go with the Shake Shack bun.  If they sold that bun in any supermarket it's what I would buy to take to a bbq for burgers.  Quality of Toppings: Shake Shack - In N Out - Five Guys In N Out has the best tomatoes, lettuce, and onions.  However, Shake Shack has bacon, superior grilled onions, and other toppings like peppers which give you much more variety.  Five Guys has the most options and they're free...but I've always found their toppings to be bland, poorly cooked, and just not good.    Fries: Shake Shack - Five Guys - In N Out Well seasoned crinkle cut fried over at Shake Shack.  NOT a good value by any means as you get an average portion at around $4.  That's insane pricing.  In N Out has pretty brutal fries IMO.  Five Guys gets silver on volume alone.  But fries are too big which means you have to put a ton of salt and/or ketchup.  Cost: Shake Shack - Five Guys - In N Out (meaning Shake Shack is the most expensive option) Shake Shack is flat out expensive.  For a double cheeseburger they charge around $10 vs. $3.50 for In N Out and somewhere in between for Five Guys.  I don't know why anyone would eat at Five Guys with the prices they charge.  Five Guys does have an awesome soda machine at Downtown Summerlin.  If you're price sensitive, Shake Shack is gonna trigger you.  TLDR; Shake Shack has really good burgers and fries.  But it's very expensive for what is essentially a fast food experience.",

    "text": "Really nice atmosphere and clean. The place was pretty full but the food was prepared rather quickly.  The staff was friendly and attentive. The burgers and fries were average, nothing to spectacular about the food. The fries were good and the cheese fries had just the right amount of cheese on top. Just your typical burger and fries joint. There wasn't anything that would set them apart unlike Tommy's in Los Angeles or In and Out. I don't think it was worth the price. I ordered two Shack Stacks, fries, cheese fries and a large root beer. Came out to a little over $32. Would I eat here again, probably not. It's not that the food was bad I just don't think it's worth the money they are asking.",

    "text": "Very disappointed by a recent experience at this location.  We have eaten at this location around 6-7 times since their inception.   One of the main reasons is that they have a menu for dogs.  They even on occasion provide a bowl for our pup to drink from.  Tonight we popped in there and was immediately told \"the dog has to be outside\" it's literally 50 degrees and too cold to eat outside let alone have the dog out there.  I brought it to the staff members attention that we are frequent customers and we \"get it\" but it's cold outside and it was never a problem during the prior 6 visits.  I added it's really nice you have a dog menu but if feels like a \"colored drinking fountain mentality\" when a business wants your dog money ...but then ya gotta eat outside when it's cold ... regardless I decided to call and express my displeasure to the manager and I spoke and was met by silence.  So I called back and was sent to voicemail.  Awesome job guys, you lost a customer at this location!",

    "text": "Service was great at the counter. Busy place, I assume patrons are to bus their tables and if they don't it takes awhile to get it cleaned as this spot is pretty busy and keeps the workers on the move when it's busy.   We ordered the single patty shackburger so delicious!!! The burger patty was crispy and delicious, the bun was perfectly soft, buttery, slightly sweet and just the right size.   My other half ordered the smokeshack thin patties BIG flavor with melty cheese and awesome bacon.   The cheese fries were pretty dang terrific too!   The strawberry mint lemonade fell short of the mint flavor and was on the sweeter side. We will definitely in to visit the L.A. location when we get back to home base.   We hope and wish for a location in Orange County, California verrrrrrry soooooon!  Keep up the delicious flavors and sustainable menu!",

    "text": "In this day and age with todays technology, how can you open a restaurant in the nicest, cleanest mall in Vegas and NOT make your restrooms touch-free. How much money did they really save by opting for the cheaper , pull flush and touch faucet?     And if you wanna sit outside, be sure to put some OFF on your skin because the flies will be having a feast on your skin, thanks to the \"open top\" garbage cans they have in the patio.   As for food, thats why i gave an extra star. Burger is promising. If it was served hot, i could consider 3 stars. But no, cold burger, terrible fries. $27 for 2 burgers, 1 fries and 2 drinks. For this price and location, i expected better.",

    "text": "**sigh** There is a saying, don't go or do anything with expectations because you will always be disappointed.    The hype over Shake Shack is tremendous. I was in NY this summer and didn't get to try it because the line was out the door every day we passed by no matter what time of day it was. Didn't want to wait in line knowing the Summerlin location was opening soon.  I wanted so much to like it but....in my opinion In'N'Out is better and here is why:  My first shock was the price. Actually I was told the prices were high, but it still made me gasp looking at the prices.  I was hungry so I ordered the double shackburger($7.99) thinking it would be like a double double from In'N'Out.  When I saw the burger it was a lot smaller. The meat was probably similar in size, but smaller buns, and much less lettuce and tomato. I prefer the toasted buns from I'N'O as well as fresher and larger portions of lettuce. After eating 3/4 of the shackburger I had no lettuce or tomato left. The bland taste made me reach for some ketchup. You should never have to do that.   I like krinkle fries and they were good, but I still prefer the fresh fries from I'N'O.  Ordered two hamburgers for the kids and three shakes. Vanilla and chocolate were okay. I tried the flavor of the week, salted caramel butter. Very good!  So fast food dinner for me and two kids came out to $41.37. Not quite worth it. Would rather pay much less for In'N'Out or Fatburger, or go sit at a nicer place at Bachi Burger for similar pricing.   Food is good. I will be back to try the custard and concrete desserts. But as I said, will not live up to the hype. If you go, then go with a 3 star rating in mind and maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did.",

Had to send my burger back because it was raw in a few spots. Had it remade as \"well done\" and it was still luke warm and the $1.89 extra bacon was cold on BOTH burgers. No thanks Shake Shack. I will continue to eat burgers at In N Out for half the price and twice the quality. Honestly, I feel ripped off.",
