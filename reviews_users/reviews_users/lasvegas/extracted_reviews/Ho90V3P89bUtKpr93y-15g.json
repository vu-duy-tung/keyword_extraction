    "text": "Well hmmm!! The service was on par, the food tasted alright and the ambiance was tranquil. Hence the 3 stars!  However, I wish there was more lighting at night on the exterior so that we can see the restaurant from the road as it was hard to spot at night. The portions of our food were \"what I am not used to seeing at other vegan places.\" I had the classic burger with waffle fries. Normally when I go to vegan places the amount of fries I get is pretty generous. At this location I had maybe about 8-10 pieces of fries spread out on my plate which were small pieces a couple pieces were the size of a half dollar while the remaining 6-8 pieces were the size of a quarter. It was not packed on like I am used to at other vegan restaurants so when I received the food I was in a little shock. Not worth the price I paid for, for that meal. The dessert selections were alright.  I may be back to give this place a shot again!",

    "text": "So I accidentally stumbled across this gem and you can best believe my next stop won't be an accident lol.  Go Vegan Cafe has so many options that I literally started salivating while looking over the menu, they have everything from freshly made and super healthy smoothies to superbly made sandwhiches, tacos, quesadillas, and much much more.   First the customer service was exceptional, the staff seemed very relaxed and friendly. As I waited for my meal to be ready I was offered a sample of their \"kookier and kreme \" smoothie and it was absolutely delicious!! I didn't order it because I didn't bring much money with me (I will next time though).   I walked around this place and there is plenty of seating on the inside, then I saw the outdoor portion. It contained a magnificent water fall structure with greenery, beautiful pieces of art on the walls and the temperature felt great as it was well ventilated. I sat out here and I was impressed by how relaxing it was despite it being 105 degrees outside. You would t know it by sitting in this area.   I ordered the Buffalo jack fruit sandwich, with a side of sweet potato waffle fries (you have a choice of a side). I wasn't impressed with this plate but I ate it anyway because I was very hungry. Also, this was my first time trying jack fruit so it wasn't a clever choice on my part as I didn't know what to expect. I also ordered the classic quesadilla and it was delicious!!!   I plan to go back and order more food because they have so much variety I feel like I did myself a disservice not bringing more money to spend there lol next time I'll bring enough to order at least half the menu   From the famous words of the Terminator....\"I'll be back\"",

The place is dingy,  the AC did not seem to work at all, and it was just about empty when we went in, but maybe because the AC doesn't work :/     Now the food, we ordered breakfast and I was pleasantly surprised.  Pancakes were great, my friends both got Tofu scrambles and they said were excellent, we shared a side of sausage and this was terrible.      The smoothies were good as well.  The water, not so good.  It tasted bad, we all independently thought this but didn't say it till the end of our meal.  Then there is the service, this is where it goes downhill to me.  I assume the owner is who served us; and he although maybe not trying to be rude; was.   A number of times we noticed he would ignore us when we called for him.  There was one other person that came in and he seemed like 2 parties was pushing him to his max of attention.  Then when we did ask for water to drink with our meal, we each noticed him roll his eyes.    Between the heat in the room which left us sweating and the service, we had to give this place a 2 and will not go back.  It's ashamed because we would love to find a good vegan place.",

What they have done is taken familiar foods that we all know and love, made them vegan without losing any of its qualities of the familiar food. They have enhanced the flavors of the food that you are enjoying by keeping two important attributes, quality and love! The quality of this food can be put next to any 4 star restaurant on the strip! The love is comparable to what your mom puts into her cooking.  I had the breakfast feast which came with your choice scramble, potatoes, pancakes and a choice of sausage or bacon. We also had the fiery dragon sushi and avocado fries (which aren't really fried). All were so delicious and perfectly proportioned. The fiery dragon is a must if you are curious about vegan sushi and quality and the breakfast feast is worth it if you want to get an idea of how much love is put into your food! I was very happy with my experience, the staff really were knowledgeable and came around frequently to check on you. Thanks again for the awesome service. The food was so good I forgot to take pictures! Eat like me.",

These two things were AMAZING! The nachos tasted just like regular nachos, it's hard to believe they weren't loaded with actual cheese and meat. And as for the tofu scramble, one of the things I miss most after going vegan are eggs, but this tofu scramble proves that the chef here does tofu better than chickens do eggs.   5 stars, easily.

The owner or manager came and chatted with us, explained the menu, the variety items and such.  The food did not take long to arrive and when it did I jumped right into my plate. It was simply amazing. All fresh ingredients, sauces made in house, beautiful presentation and the taste of every single item was well beyond my expectations.  We tried a few desert bites as well. They have a nice selection of resources- books and products for the vegan lifestyle. There's also raw food preparation classes the first Saturday of every month for those like me that need a few more ideas when cooking at home.   I loved everything and I really can't wait to go back.",

However, the jack fruit in the enchiladas had a texture that mimics meat. The guacamole was cold (as it should be) and down right delicious and fresh. The beans, which were peppered with some corn, were tasty.  To top it off, the meal was gluten free.  I will definitely be back.  Oh yeah, my German, meat-eating partner loved his sandwich too.",

    "text": "After becoming ill from one of their burritos, and finding out the Health Department had (finally) payed a visit..I was curious to see the public records on this place. My previous experiences haven't been that bad, but they certainly weren't great. Firstly...go to the bathroom somewhere else because the facilities here are gross. The service here is hit or miss, some of the employees are nice but the Management is horrendous. I've witnessed them verbally abuse their staff and even food delivery services drivers, like Uber and Grub Hub. I had ordered the classic burrito and eaten it and felt a bit off. Within the next few hours I definitely didn't feel good, and shortly after that I know it was food poisoning, or at least bad food. I haven't eaten there since. I also witnessed Management insist that an employee at the juice bar, pick up a sliced apple that fell on the dirty floor mat and use it in a juice. Luckily the juicer explained, that was against health code, but she got in trouble for doing the right thing. This verbal exchange happened in front of me and other customers. I would have called the Health Dept. right there if it went in the blender! I looked up the public records. See the photos I attached. You can see they have a good amount of demerits, even close to a C rating at times. Based on the records I can tell they are not going to change and have no real intention to run their food establishment safely for its customers. I find this dishonest practice and complete lack of respect for the publics health and well being despicable! These Two Managers have NO BUSINESS running a business. Aside from that, the actual menu items are a complete waste of your money. Most the specialty items are store bought, taken out of the package and then heated, or not, and put on your plate. And then your paying 12$ and up. Literally, freshly cut waffles fries..means frozen from the bag and stuck in the oven, and served at near room temp. There is a small stand alone freezer, over by the tea and coffee bar, and you can find your tamales in there. Frozen and off the shelf. What's really sad is that they found a way to muck up produce. The salad bar isn't sanitary, and from sitting at the juice bar, I could tell, First In First Out, was not a phrase Management has heard of or practices. You think your safe eating raw, but fruits and veggies go bad; but they don't care. And thats what makes this the even worse! they don't care about their customers who want to spend their money on a quality VEGAN experience! Being talked down to and disrespected by the two supposed owners, says it all. Save your money, go to ANY OTHER vegan spot in town. Oh, and based on the fact that they hold their employees checks for 3 weeks after they are due is a huge sign of them being in the pooper financially. And I think the nasty old man who is mean to al the customers, lives there!",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I was under the impression that it was just a juice bar with a raw menu, which typically I find boring. Now, there's nothing wrong with raw veganism, but I do like my comfort food when I eat out.  First of all, the food here is absolutely delicious! And it's not \"just a juice bar\" at all--the menu is HUGE! Not only was my meal super comforting, but it was healthy. We ate a ton and still felt amazing afterwards.  Everything was so fresh and and the flavors were very satisfying. Eating outside in the covered courtyard with the fountain and all the plants was peaceful and relaxing. Pretty sure I almost fell asleep--in a good way.  Very happy with Go Vegan Cafe. My boyfriend said this was the best tofu scramble he's ever had. I will definitely be returning soon!",

    "text": "This comment is from 2 months ago. I left it on their Facebook page so I'll copy and paste:   I've been attending this place for months. I'm not vegan but I enjoy the food and the service was always amazing UNTIL my experience today. I am really disappointed. I went in and ordered & paid for my food TO GO because I work across the street and was on my lunch break. My order was taken by the lady with dreads who is always nice and courteous. She told me that I could wait inside or in the lounge. I told her that I would be in the lounge. I decided to wait in the lounge because I had just raved to my co-workers earlier today about how beautiful it was and the nice fountain there. A waitress (1st time seeing her out of all of my visits) came out to ask if I was dining in or had take out. I told her that I wasn't dining in and that I was waiting for my food to go. ABOUT 5 MINUTES LATER: She comes back out and says,  I didn't hear what you said, are you dining in or JUST HANGING OUT. I told her AGAIN that i ordered and was waiting for my food To-Go. & then she asked for my name and i told her. THEN: she comes back out about 10 minutes (give or take) later with my order. Asks if it was my order and looks as if she didn't believe me when I stated: yes. At that point she did not have my food in a bag (which waiters or waitresses have always done before when I've ordered take out there) and she asked if I needed a bag or utensils while I was reaching for the food I told her that I did and she took the food from the lounge back inside with her. So I decided to follow her inside because I was not about to wait for her since I was on my lunch break and because she had already pissed me off that point. when I go on she's bagging my food and proceeds to ask me if I PAID!??? like she didn't already get my name before or forgetting she already asked me multiple times  if I was dining in or taking out . I told her that I did and asked if she wanted to see my receipt and she smirks and says no. I rushed back to work and called the owner, who was nice and apologized multiple times, YET all he could do was make excuses for her behavior instead of acknowledging that she was wrong. I informed him that I visited often, loved the food and prior to this day I had always received amazing service. I won't be coming back because that was ridiculous and I felt totally uncomfortable.",

The employee was nice but that's kinda overkill. Smoothie was good and soup was decent but it was literally broth and nothing else inside. Also while I was there a customer came in and asked one of the workers for a smoothie that will give her energy and his reply was read the ingredients. If you're serving healthy food workers should be somewhat knowledgeable especially if your paying these kind of prices. I waited almost 10 mins for a cup of soup that just needed to be poured and handed to me and the place was dead  The 2 stars are for the nice server and the smoothie was good.",

They're so yummy (esp the parm) but tiny! I found myself wanting more and leaving still hungry. Then I tried the raw burgers. They are definitely different if you aren't used to raw vegan food, which I wasn't when I first tried it, but now I always find myself coming back for the raw portobello burger with the nut patty. It's so filling and you feel so good after eating it! Your body processes the raw food so much better and you find yourself feeling healthy af for the rest of the day! Maybe that's just me but this is now one of my go to spots for vegan food. Also they have a really awesome patio that's so relaxing. Definitely try this place if you're more experienced in the vegan community",

The food is pretty decent, and the shakes are yummy. Their vegan iced mocha is by far one of my favorite mochas ever! Their customer service isn't always on point...sometimes it takes a while for them to notice you standing at the counter. The cafe's setup also needs some work. You are supposed to order at one counter and then walk across to restaurant to another counter to pay. Just a little awkward. Their prices are a little more on the expensive side for a cafe, but that's to be expected at health conscious eateries. Overall, Go Vegan Cafe is a good place to catch a bite if you are in the mood for something healthy.   UPDATE: I just gave their jackfruit tacos & eggplant parm a try. They were sooooo good that I needed to give them the extra star. I still think the setup needs work, but with food like that, who cares?!?",

    "text": "I hate giving a review that is less than 4 stars. I want to love everything and make everyone happy, but alas...  I came here on my lunch break today and was sat promptly and guided to a nice seat on the heated, enclosed patio. I ordered quickly (pesto tofu scramble burrito) as I had already decided what I wanted before I arrived. On a one hour lunch break, one must be efficient. I figured the food would be out quickly as the place wasn't very busy and what I ordered seemed pretty simple....25 minutes later when my food arrived I was contemplating throwing it in a to-go container so I could make it back to the office on time.  The overall taste was very good but some of the potatoes were a bit undercooked for my taste. Although considering half of their menu is raw maybe this is their cooking style? The random orange and apple slice on the plate is also quite odd. I had signed up a few weeks ago, on Facebook messenger, for a free truffle. But then they wouldn't allow me to use it without inputting my phone number and signing up for their dining membership. I did as I was told but felt a bit swindled in the moment, especially since I'm not sure I will be back. It might be in poor taste complaining about a free item but I was thinking the coupon was to simply get me in the door, not to force me to sign up.  Next time, if I'm craving a vegan lunch, I'll just order for delivery.",

The owner is so kind and has a way of bringing about a very calm and lovely vibe. Now the food is on a whole other level of tasty, not to mention you will feel amazing after...especially if you try the back or the menu- which is their raw options. My personal favorite foods are on the raw side; did I mention most items are gluten free!? Hands down the best pizza if you want a fresh twist and aren't a particular fan of vegan cheese laden pizzas. Also you can mix flavors!! Don't take my word, try it for yourself!! They're Rawsome",

The atmosphere was very sad and there wasn't that many choices to drink besides this newbies. I was never updated on what I needed or if I was OK, the food came out fast but like I said, I don't think that it was cooked all the way.I definitely will not be coming back to this place.

The house salad is not ordinary but has a bunch of different chopped veggies, sprouts, and a proprietary dressing that so perfectly merged and complimented the flavors we ate every bit of it!  Also had the BBQ Portobello sandwich with slaw and found it equally delicious. Our daughter had the Classic Cheese Pizza which again was not ordinary but had flavor augmenting spices that made me wish I'd ordered it for myself! Our other daughter had the Pesto Quesadilla and so loved it that I didn't manage to get a bite.  Loved the open airy dinning room with the big fountain.  I'd give this a 10 if I could.

My friend went to the restroom and I stayed there watching the guy getting the smoothly leftovers out of the blender and putting it in a cup.

Rod (the owner) has been trying to come visit your new business, but the only day he's around is on Mondays... & you're closed Monday's...\" That's love & respect right there. Comes to show there's still good people out there. We're still truly humbled  thank you again, @goraw.govegan! (Oh, this is the mexi pizza w jackfruit btw)",

I'm not sure about the other complaints some people had since I didn't have the same issues on my visit, but otherwise, this place is worthy if you have diet restrictions or can't bear to eat food made from animals.  We had the grilled cheese with tomatoes and the pesto pizza and a slice of carrot cake. They were smaller than average portions but overall sufficient for two people. The price is a little higher than traditional restaurants but that's expected for  non-animal and gluten free raw materials. The flavor for these meals was tasty and not bland and satisfying. The menu looks extensive so we will be back to try something else soon.",

Same goes for Go Vegan Cafe, I found this place after a search on Yelp, specifically looking for a Vegan option while in LAS on business. It was quite exciting when this popped up in the search and  I drove 5 miles with great enthusiasm to enjoy a nice healthy lunch option. The place did not disappoint. Warm, prompt service and many options to select from. I enjoyed a salad and washed it down with a healthy juice. The only reason they fall short of the 5 stars, is because most of the menu is based on vegan substitutions of the usual suspects, Pizza, Burgers, Sandwiches, Burritos, Tostadas. IMHO, there is no need to try to replicate those items, you already got us, we are Vegan, we don't walk through the door because we want to have a burger, I think we have already transitioned to the bright side, and quite frankly, you will not turn a non vegan into began just because you serve them the Vegan alternative to their flesh eating ways.  But then again... this is just my opinion, and I could be wrong.",

Fine, they have plenty of another GLUTEN-FREE options  Second, I decided on the roasted veggie quesadilla. I've had it before and it sounded good with their cheesy cauliflower soup of the day.   The soup was good, mainly just broth. Tiny bits of cauliflower floating around only.   The quesadilla on the other hand smelled bad. I took a bite and immediately had to spit it out. I finished the soup and tried again.... NOPE.... I advised the waitress that the tortilla smells bad. It also has access flour on top of it which is extremely weird.   The owner came to talk to me at a distance. I get he's the cook but felt personally attacked... explaining that the GLUTEN-FREE tortilla don't go bad. I had to correct him and advise all tortilla can go bad. He wasn't concern about what I was trying to explain and the fact that I wasn't upset. He was rude and short and felt disrespected since I set the item back.   I'll never be back. He was unprofessional and honestly just plain rude. GOOD LUCK!!!",

    "text": "Trust me when I say this is going to be one of the best vegan restaurants you've ever been to. Actually, don't take my word for it- go and try this for yourself.  I met up with my sister for a weekend in Vegas. We decided to have brunch before her flight and we truly left the best for last with Go Vegan Cafe. This location is a bit off the beaten path, but there's only so much of the Strip I can take in one sitting.   We arrived minutes after they opened and had the covered patio all to ourselves. (I believe I spotted air conditioning units, which is necessary in Vegas heat) Our server was warm and friendly and answered our questions about the extensive menu and provided great suggestions for our newbie experience. We finalized our choices to: the omelet and raw collard greens wrap. We also added the breakfast sausage because the server told us it was house made.   I've had a couple vegan omelets in the Boston area and, while they were both amazing, they resembled more of a crispy crepe than an omelet. That was not the case here. With a fluffy, souffle-like texture, it was the closest thing to the real deal I've ever had. The oat-based sausages were equally amazing. (Double check with your server if you're gluten free) As a bonus, a little muffin came as an accompaniment to our omelet. So much bang for your buck with this dish! To my absolute delight, it ended up being a seasonal strawberry rhubarb and it was perfectly baked. It was a \"This is vegan!?\" moment, for sure. The collard wrap was refreshing to eat as we felt the desert air start to warm up. The crisp wrap and creamy filling was a satisfying combination.  After our meal, we walked over to the register by the front door and saw the workers stocking the salad bar, in case you are in need of a quick meal. Another FYI, they give you stevia with coffee. I'm particular about coffee and think stevia leaves a bit of a metallic taste, but it didn't affect me since I carry around a travel size maple syrup in my purse. The coffee itself is cold-brewed, which means it's less acidic and easier on your tummy. Ever notice when milk looks curdled when you pour it into your coffee? That's a reaction to an acidic brew.",

One tamale was sooo good the jackfruit one then when it came to the jalapeno cheese one. It wouldn't come off the corn leaf thing, stuck on so I requested a new one. That took 20 mins for a new one when my first one took 5 mins. They brought out another jackfruit one that was terrible, nothing inside rock hard on outside. Now.... I asked for a replacement of jalapeno and cheese. These people are all over the place, the one guy said we thought u didn't want the jalapeno one. What? Ok so I told them dude the 2nd one was terrible u didn't serve me what I ordered.  They were like, oh we will take $3 off. What?? I are one tamale off a 2 tamale plate.   You took my guacamole and wild rice w ya, and I still have to pay $10-$11 whatever over it. Running late from lunch now.  We also orders the vege pizza. Veggies were done right but overall a bad experience.  Ordered the juicers on way out since my lunch was ruined and we were still hungry.   Guy making the juice said, u only ordered one juice, I literally just paid for 2 with the lady up front.   I think these were the owners.  U may have the vegan concept but this place is just operating and I really don't know how.  No signage visible to the restaurant.  Will not be back",

All in all, highly recommend!",

They were cooked perfectly and did not have the usual chemical taste that GF waffles have. They were very flavorful.  1 person (10 year old) has a \"burger\" and fries. For a vegan burger it was very good. I am sure it would have been even better had the child wanted it loaded instead of plain and dry. The fries were few but very delicious! He said they were better than fast food fries.  My husband and I ordered from the raw menu. They were both very good. I had the jicama fries with my meal. There were 4 slices and it was served with hummus and it was as I expected. My Mediterranean meal was delightful with the beet burger.",

Did a quick Yelp search of the photos and it appeared the mixed berry pancakes were the route to go so that's what's I went with.  I really enjoyed them. If you have any problem with soggy, that could be an issue because they send the cakes out in a plate with a puddle of a light syrup in the bottom. It didn't really bother me though honestly.   The Vegan thing isn't really for me as I eat a lot of protein. When they say vegan they mean vegan. Theres no hidden beef burger on the menu unfortunately.   We sat in the greenhouse-like area outside of the main dining room. It was really nice ambiance with a cool fountain. Unique seating area.   The problem with that was that we literally waited 15 minutes for service and the place wasn't very busy at all. After about 5 minutes we went inside to use the restroom and told the waiter we were outside and it still took 10 minutes or so for him to come out and grab our orders.   So they lose a star for the subpar service but the food was tasty.",

When I walked in, it didn't even seem like they were open for customers. The walls are bare, half of the restaurant isn't even lit and there's no counter or menus on the wall. You walk in and kind of guess where you're supposed to go. Anyways, the older guy with glasses gave me a menu and didn't say much to me after that. I had to get up and go to him to order (he was watching tv on his iPad). He literally said \"what do you want to order?\"  I gave him my order and he did not say another word to me until he brought my food out. This was extremely awkward since I was the only one in there. A couple walked in while I was waiting. He didn't greet them at all. They took a glance at the salad bar and walked out-2 potential customers missing out on a really delicious meal! Maybe they're just not worried about engaging new customers with good service or even a \"Hi, welcome to my new restaurant !\" For a new restaurant, I guess I just expected more attention to a new customer. Great yummy, organic, vegan food! Sub-par customer service.",

I found the service to be perfectly fine so no complaints there. True, the ambiance leaves a lot to be desired, but I can overlook that if the food is amazing. But it wasn't quite amazing. The first huge indiscretion is that along with my tofu scramble I was served a ketchup that had honey in it. I'm only plant-based and not vegan so I was ok with that but this is unacceptable for a place that has vegan in its name, and many people would have rightfully been angry about this. Also, the tofu scramble and potatoes were unnecessarily oily. After I cleaned my plate (it was actually very good), there was a thick layer of oil all over my plate. I understand using a little oil but when you can taste it as a dominant flavor in a dish you've gone too far. The apple muffin, however, was delicious and perfect. I will come back soon because I'm guessing there are some real winners on the menu. I'll just ask if they can use a *lot* lighter of a hand with the oil next time.",

However, there are so many wonderful vegan options in Las Vegas now that it's a little harder to slide by with a great review. I do want to compliment the fact that everything tastes fresh and you can tell they take the extra time to make everything homemade. Also, unlike some other vegan restaurants you can tell that they have a mutual focus between taste and health. I got the BBQ pulled jack sandwich. The \"meat\" was delicious, and the sopapilla made it unique. Also, it's hard to find waffle fries anymore and they did a fantastic job with them: tasty and with a crunch. My husband got the Chile Relleno. I tried his and was glad that I decided on mine. It tasted fine, but again there are so many great vegan restaurants that you don't want just fine. I do want to go back and try another one of their smoothies. They have a Durian one that I am intrigued by.",

The menu has so many different options from burgers all the way to quesadillas, there's something for everyone. I ordered the raw veggie wrap and he got the eggplant sandwich. I also grabbed a few truffles from their dessert bar (it was so hard to choose from all of the options haha) Such a cute atmosphere and all of the employees were really nice and helpful :)",

I was in Vegas on business and found it on Happy Cow's list.  Their menu has something for everyone, whether you eat a vegan diet or not.  The service is undeniably great.  I made this my home away from home and ate all of my lunches and dinners there for the four days I was in the area.  It's not like some vegan restaurants that serve vegan fast food; the food is clean and extremely delicious.  When you're in the Las Vegas area you must go to Go Vegan!  It's an experience you will never forget.",

    "text": "I LOVE THIS PLACE and someday I'll live closer and visit regularly.   My dad and fiance are not vegan, but both enjoy the food regardless.  My dad and I went here for lunch and had a very relaxing time with delicious food. We ordered the following:  Yummy \"Grilled Cheese & Tomato\" with delectable \"Sweet & Spicy Fries\" Excellent \"Eggplant Parmigiano\" with Mouth watering \"Coleslaw\" Best Ever \"Cold-pressed Coffee & Coconut Water over Ice\"  During another visit, I ordered a decadent Double Layer jelly filled Chocolate Cake to bring home for my guy and it's to die for!   In fact, today we're currently awaiting delivery of that cake, Chile Relleno, Enchiladas & Cheese Fries. I'm certain the food will be the highlight of our day and it's been a great day!   Restaurant Details: I love the garden area with the fountain. It's sometimes difficult to hear out there from the echo of the water fountain, but I still love it. Inside is pleasant and inviting too. The ambiance is so peaceful that it's somewhat romantic. The place is spacious with a quaint feel. There's a salad bar full of fresh, wonderful looking produce, a bakery counter with enticing sweets and a juice bar.    Service Details: They never rush you. In fact, they invite you to make yourself at home which brings a sense of relief from the madness of the day. Everyone I encountered was friendly, caring and attentive to requests.   I also attended an awesome Raw Food Workshop here and look forward to attending more! Check out govegan.cafe for details.   Browsing the books for sale and discovering other things in the market section that I never knew existed was cool.  I think this would be a great place to do some studying, research, reading, writing, etc.   Oh...as for the wait at the Cafe, I was busy dealing with a situation on the phone while we waited for our meal, so it didn't seem like it took long at all.   And, the food we ordered today was delivered by <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonlinerestaurants.com&s=ac27aade2eea9dffb1344557b51b7631f6195398cb85f1e1dcd4ca50c054c367\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">onlinerestaurants.com</a>. The driver was delightful and the grub was absolutely delicious!  Thanks for reading! Hope to see you there sometime!",

    "text": "Someone once said \"No one chooses to go to Denny's, they just end up there.\"  I somehow ended up at a restaurant serving raw vegan.  Hey!  They don't have to cook any of it!  This should come out quick! haaaaa  When I used to live in NYC, there was a semi well known \"Juice Bar\" on St Mark's for a while that was a front for selling illegal things.  Walking into this pretty empty space totally reminded me of that.  Aside from the salad bar in the center of the relatively big room, one would be hard pressed to tell if the restaurant was coming or going.  There was a sushi display case at the rear counter from probably like 4 businesses ago and a bar on the right that looked like it hadn't seen a patron in years.  With its basement type ambiance, Go Vegan Cafe is clearly a takeout type eatery.  I doubt a person that lives this type of lifestyle cares about any of that since a lack of vegan options in the neighborhood would totally supersede atmosphere.  The \"Raw Portobello Burger\" with its nut patty (made with almonds, sunflower seeds, sun-dried tomatoes, ginger, & carrots) was better than expected.  The creaminess of the almond \"cheese\" and avocado made for a more than passable garden sandwich.  The onion rawtilla bun wasn't flimsy at all and held everything together nicely.  The \"fries\" were simply 3 slices of breaded avocado hmmmm. My wife liked her \"Veggie Wrap\" which was basically a reshaped salad as collard greens were used as the tortilla.  The house slaw that came with her dish with its unique dressing was the tastiest thing we had.    Two dishes and veggie juice came out to $37, yet both of us were still hungry later.  Wanting to stay consistent with the whole raw evening, I ate a couple of bananas later on.  There's really no rush for me to return, but if I find myself on one of those beefx5 kind of weeks, this would be a good way to change up the eating cycle.",

The sweet potato comes with it was so overly fried it's hard to chew. I didn't even want it but they said there's no option of just ordering a sandwich.  Not to mention the weird older guy in the book/market section. I can tell he's not very happy that I pay at that station for food not paying for market products. Plus, why put a book section/ market section in a restaurant? Just strange lay out in this place. And the interior design is just..they can do so much more in this space and make it so much more elegant.",

I buy organic sweet potatoes - they are not THAT expensive. Most of the menu items are just not enough food. You shouldn't leave a restaurant hungry. Why don't they care enough about their customers to even address their complaints? I don't usually bother reviewing restaurants at all but this just irks me.",

    "text": "I'm still new at exploring vegan places, so I was really happy I could try this establishment with Tigra, my vegan muse and Happy Cow expert.  We decided to order family style and ordered the following items: Fruity Pancakes, The Loaf (Lentil Loaf), Tofu Scramble, Fried Avocados, and Sausage Links.  Once we placed the order, I decided to also order a coffee drink. Our waitress was so sweet and offered to customize my drink with fresh coconut water, suggesting to include it in a blended beverage because I could not decide on what I wanted, I was struggling between a blended Mocha vs. Iced Coffee over Coconut Water.  The waitress said they could just add Coconut Water to my blended beverage, it'd be a little unconventional but they could do it. i was really happy with this suggestion but then one of the owners came up to our table discouraging my custom order. \"Why do you want coconut water in your blended drink\", he asked me rudely. I was a little puzzled, I just wanted to try something new, but didn't want to make a big deal out of it so I changed my order and I  simply ordered Iced Coffee over Coconut Water. The beverage was delicious, but I was put off by the fact that the owner had to come out and have a conversation with me.  Our waitress also returned to say that they could not accommodate cooking 1 pancake. We had asked earlier since we were tasting a lot of different foods if this was OK, but again, one of the owners remained inflexible and basically said it's all or nothing. We begrudgingly ordered the full order of pancakes.  Finally, the food itself arrived. It's no surprise that a lot of the items were hit or miss. The Fruity Pancakes were delicious and the Tofu Scramble, i couldn't even tell they weren't real eggs. I liked the Lentil Loaf, even though it was walking the line of moist and dry. The sauce tasted great on it.  The bad? The sausage links were mealy and fell apart into pieces and the fried avocado wasn't even fried, just rolled around in a lot of spices. We finally confronted the other owner about our experience, and she was really understanding. Based on the food and how understanding the other owner was, I would still give this place 4 stars, they did a great job with the entrees, but with the other owner having that conversation with me, I must give it 3 stars. I've never had someone discourage me or my party from a custom order to the point where they have to personally talk to us about it...Hopefully, if you come here you will just have a positive experience with the food.",

It has a small corner dedicated to vegan snacks and vitamins like a mini grocery store. On a raised platform, there's a small display of desserts ranging from cookies to cakes.  The menu sounds appetizing. Their fresh juice drinks are absolutely fabulous. The burger did not have a hamburger/ciabatta bun (as pictured on menu) but a flat, hard, whole wheat English muffin-type bun. Extra crispy waffle fries were edible.  The female employee was nice. The older male employee checked up on our food and didn't smile.   Large floor plan but it needs to be redesigned for a better flow...maybe someone should also redesign the menu. I felt the menu was catered more towards raw vegan than vegan. I'll come back to grab their refreshing drinks.",

This place was dead btw, not busy at all...My mom had to go inside ( because we sat outside) and ask a waitress to please fill her glass with water because she came and filled mine and my boyfriends water but walked away from my mom when she put her glass up asking for water...  2.) my mom can't eat onions, they don't sit right with her so she asked for no onions on her BBQ sandwich and when we finally 45 mins later received the food, there was pickled onion on it AND onion in the mixture with the mushrooms. ( which we didn't know about the onions  being in the mix as well if it had just been the pickled onions on top we could have just picked it off and be fine with it. ) She sent it back asking to take it off of the bill  and didn't bother re ordering since it took so long for our original order.  3.) THIS is the most angering part of our experience here. We told the woman up front about what happened with my moms order and here's her response \" oh. Well if you would have said you had an allergy we would have not put onions on it.\" To which I replied \" if a customer asks for an item to not be on her plate it shouldn't be there we shouldn't have to say it's an allergy.\" Her response made me very angry because to me it sounded like if you don't have an allergy and request your food that you're paying for a certain way, we won't do it. There's more than just allergy reasons to not have an ingredient in the food you're paying for to not be on the plate.  She was dismissive and tried to pass blame on my mom for them messing up the order.  4.) the food was not worth this hassle.   Not good. Never will be back. No thanks.",

    "text": "I haven't gone here enough to give it a really low rating or a high one but I'll just start off by saying my first visit was more than enough to make an opinion on this.  The menu seems overpriced for what you're getting and in my opinion, I don't think what you're getting is what you're paying. The coffee isn't too good. I ended up ordering a waffle-- which wasn't too bad, it was nice, airy, crispy in the right areas and very fluffy on the inside but portion-wise, paying $14 for a waffle that's not even topped with anything (nor comes with any sort of side) is not worth it. I got the chocolate on the side-- I wish the waitress advised me with how hot it would be. It was scalding hot up to the point where you'd scorch your tongue if you're not too careful. The sauce itself was good but again, nothing too special. It tasted like melted chocolate (with the consistency of water-- I almost thought that it was just a chocolate bar that was melted that added a vegan butter and/or water just to thin it out).   I'm not saying that the food isn't bad but I'm not saying it's great either. I just wouldn't come here again to pay the money I had, for what we originally got. If you do end up coming here, I'd advise to purchase something more filling because if you don't-- you will most definitely not get your money's worth and you'll still be hungry when you leave the place. It was almost $20 just for a waffle and coffee (nothing else)... Honestly, you could use less at other vegan-friendly places within the area, get more for your money's worth, and actually be satisfied with what you've gotten. Would not recommend this place.",

I ordered a breakfast burrito. I can't remember what my husband had ordered, but we we're both impressed with the quality, taste & value for money spent.   There aren't a ton of vegan options on the strip, especially if you haven't won big at the casino (they are very expensive).

The reason for the low rating is based solely on the food.   My boyfriend said that if this was his first attempt at eating vegan he'd never ever try it again.  Nothing tastes good.   The only thing we found edible was the burger patty.   We started with the Mediterranean plate.   The hummus was dry and tasted like tuna.   The baba ganoush tasted horrific.   The falafel was dry and flavorless.  I ordered the jackfruit bbq sandwich.   The sopa was hard and dry and there was so much liquid that it squirted all over my hands, face, and shirt.    All the plates came with pea shoots and an apple and orange slice.  There's no need for this.   The expensive plates should have something of substance like more of the meal we ordered.   My bfs burger came with like 10 fries.   The thing that actually made me mad about the fries was they it says they are baked but it's clear they are purchased and were fried previously.   We also didn't like the fact that the cooks had to come out to the salad bar to get veggies and supplies to cook in the back.   This seems off to me and I did not like that.  This was definitely the worst vegan restaurant I've ever been too.   Definitely the worst restaurant I've been to in some time.",

NO, and did not eat one -Salad Bar a good selection, salad dressing was amazing - 2 Raw desserts-Coco one was really good  The inside of the Cafe is well done, and the fountain is beautiful! Service was great. My suggestion is to dine in and do the salad bar, desserts or a smoothie. But if you are looking raw food, you may want to try another place.",

I love that they have a rewards system on an app. You just check in on Fivestars and add up the points redeemable for menu items when you earn enough.

    "text": "I have been to Go Vegan Cafe a few times, but I have not had all of their main dishes. Therefore, my review is based on just a few things.   I have had their fresh juices and smoothies. My favorite fresh juice in general is an apple, carrot, beet, ginger. The had two different drinks that had these ingrediants, so I had to add ginger to one of them. It was a decent juice. For me it is pretty hard to mess this juice up.  I have also had the Pina Cool-ada raw smoothie. Filled with pineapple, banana, coconut, cashew, and date, this smoothie keeps me filled up all day. Very refreshing and yummy.   As for food, I can't remember everything I have had in the past. Recently, I tried their salad bar. At $9 per pound, I didn't mind the price too much. I eat fairly lightly, and was able to create a sampling from the salad bar for about $5. I especially enjoyed the potato salad and the vegan ranch dressing. I also tried the vegan cheesy cauliflower soup. This was definitely not cheesy and thick like the non-vegan version, but it was still great as a more broth-y version. It had a little kick that I wasn't expecting, and I actually enjoyed it (normally spice scares me!)   The service here has always been relatively attentive and friendly. I enjoy the large indoor courtyard area. It is a unique space not often found in Vegas.  Some of the reviews I have read talk about the quality of the food and cleanliness of the place in general. So far I have yet to see any issue. If it were more affordable to grab a fresh juice all the time, I would definitely come here.",

I ended up having the kale salad and was very pleased with the flavor and portion size. Next time I think I'll try some of the banana pancakes!

I felt like having a plate with a bunch of different things thrown together so I ordered the nachos. It really probably was the best thing I could have ordered because it was oddly filling and pretty good. Vegan cheese has always been a fear of mine for whatever reason, I have this thing in my head about it not being good because of a past experience but that was not the problem here.  The other dish was the enchilada which was presented really nice but I wasn't a fan, something was missing but honestly there's only one way to find out and that's me coming here again and making sure it wasn't just an off day for them.

Our server was extremely nice and relaxed and willing to answer all of our questions. We perused the salad bar which looked AMAZING! It was serve yourself by the lb for $9!!! I DEEPLY regret not opting for this. It had salad fixings, hummus, potato salads and veggie galore! All so fresh.   I decided on the traditional burger w sweet potato fries and a choco-cinn smoothie. My friend ordered the loaded nachos and another item I can't recall, but is pictured (tostadas?).   Our food arrived fairly quickly and it looked really good! I am by no means a vegetarian or vegan, but I do love veggie burgers. This was not disappointing! It was full of black bean flavor, corn and spices. My only regret is not reading the description more closely because it had a lot of mustard on it!  But still delicious. The smoothie was great as well. Very banana-y tasting which my friend said most of their smoothies taste like.   Check out is done up front. I had a bit of sticker shock as this place is not cheap by any means, unless you get a special or the salad bar. My burger and fries were $14 and regular smoothie was $7. I definitely want to return though to try some of their other items!!",

Our very kind waitress Maria was very patient & understanding of my cousin & I because we took awhile to figure out exactly what we wanted. We got our food in a reasonable amount of time & it came out hot! Everything was super delicious & it makes it 100% better knowing it was all vegan! Super friendly & peaceful place.

    "text": "We arrived a little over an hour and a half before a scheduled float next door and intended on getting a light meal in before our float.  When we arrived the restaurant was empty.  It was 110+ degrees outside so it was a little warm, but not terrible inside the cafe.  They had all the lights off and ceiling fans running, it reminded me a little of eating at places outside the US where they don't rely on 24-7 AC.    We sat down and looked over the menus for a few minutes, we ordered a green juice, raw pizza, and jackfruit tacos.  The juice arrived shortly, maybe 10 min?  The man who took our order was the one who made the juice.  A middle aged woman was also slowly pacing behind a counter watching  us, but aside from that they appeared to be the only staff in the front of the house. They were both kind of joyless and not at all welcoming.   Another table of two arrived after my friend got her juice.  We were chatting and I noticed this table received their food order before ours even though they arrived about 20 minutes after we did.  We continue to chat and anticipate our food.  I checked the clock and noticed we had been waiting over 45 min for our food and only had about 15 min before our scheduled float.  I got up and inquired, and apparently the man forgot to put in our order.  I asked to just cancel the order and pay for the juice as we had to go.  He offered to have the food prepared for us after our float, and I declined as the point was to eat BEFORE the float.  He didn't seem to want to do that and said \"well they already started the food, it should only be about 5 more min\", well by then it would be time for us to be next door.  I insisted that we just get it to go then, and he still brought it out on plates.  I asked for the check and some boxes.  Pretty unpleasant.  The food was okay.  I enjoyed raw pizza that had hummus on it, but otherwise it wasn't anything special and certainly not worth waiting over an hour for.  (it's hummus spread on dehydrated nut crust and sprinkled with chopped tomato and arugula, it should have taken maybe 2 minutes to assemble at the most.  My friends jackfruit taco and rice and beans tasted microwaved and all elements were prepared ahead of time and simply assembled so there is no reason for the hour wait except the man forgot).  No apology or acknowledgement of inconvenience.  The raw pizza was about the size of 2 wasa crackers and cost $16.  Our total bill was about $45 with tax.    Not recommended.",

Her cold heart most certainly doesn't want to make me go back there.  She left a poor first impression with me.  Her juices weren't even very good.  She uses the wrong high speed juicer.  She needs the Norwalk juicer because most of the juices are going straight to the trash can with her high speed juicer and your getting mostly water.  You can tell because if you leave her juice on the table for a minute it separates and you get water at the bottom.  Norwalk juicer doesn't do that.  You get the full nutrition with the right juicer.  She is using the wrong type of juicer.  The lady working there was very rude with no people skills.  It wouldn't have even mattered if they made the juice properly.  Her bad attitude and poor demeanor would have still made it hard for the juice to go down",

The Mediterranean burger patty was pretty flavorless and the texture was less than ideal. It was a mushy patty that fell apart at each bite. It had \"tabouleh\" and hummus on it as well. I saw both on the burger, but tasted neither. The burger was $16 and came with just a few cross cut fries.   The fruit looked old and as though it had been sitting there for a few days. Side note, the salad bar is self service and is $9/pound..which in my opinion is pretty over priced.   Overall, 1 star for food, 1 star for service. This place is pretty pricey for the tiny portions and less than mediocre food.",

    "text": "If you find yourself in the unfortunate circumstance of entering the stank and lifeless tomb, please be sure to not poke the zombie owner in search of your favorite fresh juice. Twice we had gone there to get juice. And twice we had encountered the very surly and customer-unfriendly owner of the establishment who looked as if he is just been awakened from a long and restless sleep. Please, understand that as a customer of this place, you are not allowed to have what you want. You will have to get what they give you instead. In case you wish to protest- the mean spirited owner we have dealt with twice - will shot down and refuse the service.   I ordered the green juice. A young waiter took the order and charged the card. I asked if they had all the ingredients ( kale, celery, cucumber, parsley, spinach, collard greens). The waiter asked me for the menu back and looked at the ingredients. He acknowledged that they were out of collard greens. He offered to add extra kale instead. I insisted on substituting the missing product with parsley. He agreed and noted it on the order. As he started working on it- the juicer jammed due to not being properly cleaned. The owner came with a lug wrench, took apart the juicer, and cleaned it. After about 15-20 min the juicer was fixed. Then the owner decided to clean up the bar area. It took him another 7 min. In no time did they offer water or such. In fact, the old grouchy owner told us to go elsewhere cause he didn't feel comfortable with us watching him. When he did eventually start making juice, we discovered WHY he didn't want us watching him. He started to fill the juicer with celery sticks and kale, totally ignoring my request about extra parsley instead of missing herb. After we tried to stop him by reminding that we ordered extra parsley -  he immediately stopped, threw the remaining celery stick in the trash and replied ' how about I just give you the money back?!' To which we gladly said 'ok!'    Luckily, we escaped this dark and gloomy establishment. NEVER to return!",

We also enjoyed sitting out in their enclosed patio area.   *Cons- The service was pretty lackluster and it took forever till someone actually came out to bring even some water ( we were acknowledged when first walking in). While it looks plentiful in the photo the side of fries they give you is super small, at least my serving was. That however wasn't the big blunder but the fact that my waffle fries tasted like day old reheated fries and they weren't even hot. Just room temperature like they'd sat out forever. I brought this to the attention of our waitress and she was kind of dumbstruck. Her reply was a \" Oh umm, okay. Sorry\". Just that and nothing else, no comp on our bill or offer of fresher fries. My toddler was with us and like most her age loves fries. She wouldn't even eat them, so that's telling you something.   Overall I'm willing to go back and try again but maybe try something else and ordering to go.",

I purposely went out of my way to download Yelp just to help this cafe grow. Their outdoor dine-in 'garden' was so peaceful. I would also like to add that I am not vegan, but I am a health nut and the fact that I know everything on that menu is healthy, loved it. They also had that salad cold/hot bar where you weigh your food out like at Whole Foods. So convenient.",

My meat eating sister said her burger was a little mushy so maybe ask them to make it crispy if you order one. I got the Spanish breakfast burrito and it was fantastic. My sister loves the sushi, my little sister LOVED the vegan pizza (and she's tried a lot of vegan pizza and is never satisfied), and my other sister (I know there's a lot of us) got the enchilada and devoured it. They also had dessert options which were so freaking good: I had the carrot cake, one had the raspberry chocolate, and the other had Oreo (which she said was little dry) and the strawberry shortcake cake which was the best out of all.  Highly recommend for former vegans! The only complaint was the server we had: she seemed not \"all there\" and would make super intense eye contact and was very \"high\" sounding.",

Prices aren't a steal, but they aren't too bad and putting healthy fare into your body is worth a few extra bucks.    The cold-brew coffee with coconut water is one of my favorites, as it's a unique/interesting combination.  I tend to order from the raw menu and am not in love with any particular item, but I'd say they're all just fine.  When I'm in the mood for comfort food, the vegan grilled cheese with tomatoes and sweet potato fries is amazing.",

I tasted it myself because I was curious and I had to spit it out. Mind you, I haven't had to spit food out in years. Wifey's pizza had no flavor and she scrapped the cheese off the top and just ate the bread. How can u go wrong with pizza. Oh yea and the waiter forgot to put in my order of tacos so never tasted those... disappointed and still hungry.",

I've been trying to incorporate a more plant-based diet and was happy to see a healthy food option near where I work, so I decided to give it a try.   The portobello raw burger was great. I got a side of the house salad and holy cow, I don't know what they put in it, but it's seriously delicious. You can get a small container of it to go, but I wish they bottled it and had it all the time. I often thought that you need to eat a lot of food to feel full on a raw diet, but apparently not: I was really full after eating only half the burger and decided to bring the rest home.   My second time was to grab a smoothie to go. It was delicious and filling.  This time, I tried the raw feast sampler platter with a portobello wrap and the ole tostada. Both were super good. You really don't think you're eating something that's 100% raw or vegan.   The only downside might be that it's on the pricier side, but I don't mind paying because the quality is so good. Definitely check this place out!",

It was YUMMY but NOTHING compared to the food that I ordered, chile rellenos and it comes with a rice and beans mix.     I took one bite and I was HOOKED.   I will go back as soon as I can and I plan to hit the whole menu from top to bottom though I admit I want more chile relleno!  Its all Vegan and for those who think that Vegan food is bland or is all lettuce and grass, THINK AGAIN.      My ex was with me and he tried a cherry smoothie and loved it, his only complaint was that the large cup is a too small!     Its filling though so you dont really need more than what they give you.  I also bought the ever elusive VIRGIN CHEESE to try and some Violife cheese and they had a salad bar, snacks that looked amazing, more cheese varieties that I will try next time and even books...There was one book...I might go back for it....a 2019 guide to everything Vegan in Vegas...As you know if you follow me, I am not 100% transitioned yet but with this place on the list, I think it will make it a hell of a lot easier for sure!  I didnt catch the girl's name who helped us, I have severe social anxiety so I couldnt sit still long enough to catch it.   :/       Oh and before I forget, they have this amazing courtyard with a fountain and tables to sit at and above you is the sky, I think they should put in water spritzers, that would feel so good in the summer and if customers didnt want to get wet, well, they can sit inside at the tables and booths--what do you think?     :O",

I was slightly disturbed when I went to pay my bill was tad bit higher than I expected because they charged me $1.50 for a tiny TINY ramekin of extra dressing... The dressing was good, but the salad did not have enough (in my opinion...and I'm not a heavy dressing person) but the bigger issue is I was not told it was extra and that bothered me. Other than that, it was great. I just don't like feeling gouged...at most it should've been 50 cents for the amount I was given.",

The kids loved the pancakes but the waffles stole the show. The cheese used in the scramble was amazing (they sell it onsite). The sausage wasn't a big hit so next time we'll try the bacon (not gluten free). The staff was warm and inviting. Will definitely come again!",

Pretty much I could of made a better one at home , I asked for the sour cream On the side when it came it was about 1 tablespoon , I also added Cholula  bottle hot sauce to it for an added flavor  I had a glass of water with my meal . The service was not really that good for it not being busy and  Anyways when it came time to check out I was charged a bit more then I saw in my receipt that I was also charged $1.50 for the sour cream which I was never told that it was extra , not only that I left a $2.00 tip so I walked out of there paying almost $14.00 for what I'd call frozen vegetables  and some cheese with pesto spread . No I'm not happy about that I really believe that there's better Vegan places I'll try but I won't be going back to this spot",

We decided to get kinda the same order but salads instead of potatoes since we were getting nacho waffle fries,  the waitress said we had to get fries with a combo which it was a total of  $19 for each of us, but why??? Tons of restaurants let you switch salad for fries, or fruit but here you are forced to get their fries, if you want salad is extra. This time I order the quesadilla with roasted veggies, waitress said there was eggplant, and I don't like eggplant , I wanted mushrooms, so same deal I had to pay extra for tiny bit of mushrooms,  I wish I could post the picture of that poor quesadilla made with Daiya cheese...... I thought everything was homemade but I guess not for quesadillas,  or pizzas terrible experience sadly I won't go back to an overpriced place with 0 options unless you PAY EXTRA! Everything is just about the money, they want you to pay for extra FOODS that you don't need in your plate and it will end up as a waste, because you don't need all th at food and pay for extra items just because they want you to spend more money!!! I'm ok with paying $19 for a plate, but why do you push customers to get extra food that won't be eaten. They also need better customer service for a high overpriced restaurant.  End of the story the quesadilla was not good, I really thought they would use homemade cheese super dry, not good at all, and my husband's burger was ok... \"mexicali burger\", but he only got less than 8 fries lol",

We make it a point to eat at a new vegan place anytime we end up in the area of one. Unfortunately for us, this place was close today. Adam ordered our food to go. Simple salad for him with a juice & soup, mexiburger for me with classic waffle fries, an iced hazelnut coffee, & 2 shots of wheatgrass. He walks in the door & I open the box & the first thing I see is a small pile of maybe 4 waffle fries that are dried out & shriveled up. I pick one up & take a small bite & it was so old & stale that is fell apart all chalky & weird in my mouth. I spit it out immediately & looked at my significant other & did the classic \"this is awful...try it!\" So he did. He also spit it out. I take the bun off to inspect the burger as now I am suspect if everything they serve & I see the top bun is covered in mayo & ketchup with this big discolored slimy green thing laying over the burger & a heaping pile of cilantro. I look at the bottom bun & it is drowned in Dijon mustard.  There is no quac just a small side of some creamy green sauce. And the bun was that thick chewy type of stale where you struggle to detach a bite from the rest of it & can't chew it to save your life. I call & the girl who answered REFUSED to let me speak to a manager. I had to repeat my request 10 times. Then the manager get on the phone who says he is also the owner which I hope is not True, & I tell him the girl who answered was awful & he has the audacity to say \"yea whatever; what's your problem?\" WHAT?! I was speechless. I tell him the problem with my food being covered in ketchup mayo and Dijon mustard & he asks if we have eaten there before, I say 'no' then he tries to say \"yes that's always how we make it\" I told him I read the menu (screenshot below) & he gets upset that I read it to him word for word so I know that it doesn't then says \"I know you're just after your money back so you need to just find somewhere else to get your vegan food\" I was stunned. I'm still stunned! Do Not support these types of businesses & business owners. There are too many good people & small businesses to support that treat their customers with respect and serve accurate quality food.",

    "text": "First time I've eaten at a Vegan restaurant, and I've got to admit I was very impressed by the overall quality. The food tasted healthy and fresh while still full of flavor.  I've been looking to eat less meat and dairy for health reasons, and we were nearby so decided to give it a try. I've had a few vegan dishes that surprised me lately, so this place seamed like something I really wanted to try. Both my wife and I were very happy with the outcome.  Just an FYI before I talk about the food we ordered, this place has a full menu of cooked vegan items and raw vegan items. I understand some vegans don't want to eat anything cooked (I don't get that one at all, but to each their own) so this place has plenty of options in that area to. My wife and I stuck to cooked food though. They also have full selection of fresh juices and smoothies.  I ordered the Spanish southwest scramble, which uses tofu and vegan cheese to emulate an egg scramble. It came with breakfast potatoes and a vegan chocolate muffin. My wife got the grilled veggie sandwich, which comes with a side (my wife chose potato salad.  We sat in the patio area, which is still indoors but is beautiful and has a nice fountain in it. The staff was extremely pleasant and our server offered recommendations, and later even told us a bit about how the food is prepared.  The food came out and it was honestly some of the best plating I have ever seen outside of a fine dining establishment. The use of greens and the different colors from the plates and veggies just made everything pop out. I recommend checking the pictures for this place.  The scramble was incredible, and I would defy anyone to think this wasn't an egg dish. The breakfast potatoes were very good, and the muffin was good to, though much denser than a normal muffin. The veggie sandwich and potato salad were also very good. Both the scramble and sandwich used vegan cheese and you really couldn't tell it wasn't dairy.  I only have one real complaint and that is the portion sizes for the price. The building that Go Vegan Cafe is full of health related places (yoga, herbal supplements, etc.) and the portions are probably very healthy for you in terms of calories. Us Americans are used to big meals, and I'm OK with the smaller size provided (heck, I would be far better off eating smaller portions),  but I can't help but think the prices should be just a tad lower. My wife's sandwich was made with bread smaller than your typical loaf you'd get at a grocery store, and it wasn't exactly loaded with veggies. My omelet was also small and they portion of breakfast potations was the smallest potato side I have probably ever had with a meal. I wonder if they just charge more because this is in a ritzier part of town where people are used to paying more, or if they charge more because the vegan food is so labor intensive to prepare. I hope the latter.  Speaking of prices, their juice and smoothie menu seemed really overpriced. It scared me away from trying anything on it, but based on their food I would think their fresh drinks are very good.  I don't want anyone to think I'm being overly negative about the prices here, as I'm not trying to be. This place was very, very good. I actually wish it was closer to where I live, as I am on the other side of town, and I would be stopping here regularly if it wasn't such a drive. I am planning on going here again if I end up on that side of town again soon.  This is a great place for a light and healthy meal. Its a perfect spot for breakfast or lunch, and don't let the Vegan thing scare you away. Even devout carnivores would enjoy a meal here.",

This was a great find.    I had the Grilled Cheese sandwich and minestrone soup. It was excellent.  This was a gluten free and vegan sandwich and I enjoyed every bit of it.  The cheese tasted good and melted perfectly. Dave had the burger which he raved about.  He wanted to take home a pack of the buns just to eat.   I have to say the service was excellent and friendly.  As I said, I ordered the minestrone soup and the broth was excellent.  I should tell you that I am a picky eater.  Among other things, I just don't do onions.  This soup was packed with onions and consequently, I left most of it uneaten.  I really felt bad when he didn't charge me for the soup.  But he was gracious about the situation.   The atmosphere was a little bohemian and perfect for the meal.  It's clean and funky and a fun place to eat.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying other things.  The salad bar looks fantastic.",

I have celiac so am highly sensitive to gluten and feel anxious going to new restaurants that may cross contaminate but this place made me feel so comfortable.  All Vegan, everything is gluten free except for one item that they get from an outside source and has seitan in it.   I got a coconut and raw burger and it was incredible. I will be back every day that I am staying in vegas!  Highly recommend for anyone with gluten sensitivity or who is vegan.",

It comes close to a regular breakfast burrito in my opinion. We also got the classic burger, which was just okay. We got a side of waffle fries, in the box it comes with only a couple waffle fries, which was disappointing. Also, the burger had a lot of mustard, so unless you're a mustard fan, I would tell them to go easy. The third thing we ordered was a small batch of plain pancakes. The order came with three decent sized pancakes that were made fresh but completely flavorless, aside from a subtle hint of cinnamon. The syrup was a molasses or something of the sort. Would come back, but not somewhere I'd eat on the regular.",

I ordered the tamale plate but the rice and beans smelled and tasted rancid so I skipped over it and kept to the tamale which tasted like the kind you'd find in the freezer aisle of a market. The cheese pizzas we ordered were the Daiya cheese pizzas you could also get at the store, if you're lucky to find it. The only thing I really LOVED was the chocolate cake that had cherries in it which was delicious with the frosting on the cake. But everything is rather overpriced for tasting like freezer food. I am planning on going back but will probably only order their raw food and smoothies/juice as I'm sure it's got to be made in house.",

I absolutely love that most of the menu is gluten-free. I had the waffle cheese fries which were super crunchy and came with pico de gallo and guacamole on the side what more could I ask for? \"Is butter a carb? Whatever I'm getting cheese fries.\" My boyfriend ordered the classic burger and the gluten free bun was amazing. I loved that the burger patty was visibly made of black beans but had a very subtle and inviting flavor unlike other over-seasoned ones I've had.  Before we left we grabbed some gluten-free chocolate chip cookies, which were pretty pricey $6.48 for 4 small cookies, but delicious nonetheless. I'll definitely try it again.",

Its like the owner woke up one day and decided to put up a cafe with whatever furniture they had at home. It literally made me feel sad. I'm all for becoming an entrepreneur-  but come on now... you can do better than this.  Then there's the food? I eat alot. But for the first time ever - I did not finish the food that was served. I ordered a $12 pizza (pesto). My husband got what he thought was a sandwich, but we have no idea what he actually got served with. Total bill was around $35 for food that was barely edible. Did I mention their coffee was $8 a glass?   I would take your hard earned money and just go elsewhere.   They have a big menu, both raw and cooked. I would highly suggest that they downsize that menu and concentrate on a few items that they can make well and redecorate.",

The jackfruit enchiladas are so fresh and delicious, you won't know it's not meaty and the vegan cheese and sour \"dream\" has great flavor. The \"BBQ sandwich\" is open-face on sopapillas so it's not exactly able to be picked up, but it's still pretty delicious! I tried the mushroom version, but if the jackfruit filling is anything like the enchiladas then it's very flavorful.  The waffle sweet potato fries were pretty soggy, not crispy enough, but tasted good. Those were the only fries we had so, not sure if their regular fries are different. Overall everything was delicious and I'd eat here again, though it definitely isn't cheap. Very satisfied customer here!",

    "text": "Very disappointed. I would not call this place delicious at all. Although the service is friendly, the food is absolutely awful. We have been trying to eat a more vegan-based diet and I have made a lot of vegan food at home, including burgers, and have been blown away by how delicious the meals are. I would expect nothing less of a restaurant. We came here today and I will tell you that they are good when it comes to their juices. I ordered the coconut juice with a shot of wheatgrass juice and beet juice and my friend ordered a juice made of beet juice along with carrot and apple and she really liked it. We ordered a quesadilla with vegetables as a starter. It was just OK and I would not order this dish again. Two of us ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana sandwiches. We added sweet potato waffle fries which were an extra $3.50 a top of a charge of $11.50 already. The extra would not have been there had we ordered regular potato fries. The sandwiches were absolutely disgusting. There is no other way to say it. The eggplant was over charred and poorly prepared with very soggy oily bread and a sweet tomato sauce and too much pesto that was just awful. The sweet potato fries were soggy and oily and just gross. I pretty much threw my meal away because it was literally inedible. We ordered a classic veggie burger for our son and I mean it when I say that it could have come from a dumpster. It was absolutely awful to the point where none of us could eat it because of how bad it tasted. It was so incredibly disgusting. I have made many veggie burgers from scratch at home that are 100 times better! Honestly, if I had started being vegan and was not cooking dishes on my own, this restaurant would literally deter me from continuing on that path because of how bad the food is. The desserts are OK but not that great. They are also exorbitantly expensive. For 3 little nuggets, truffle sizes, of combination desserts of almonds and coconut and different ingredients, it is six dollars for three small nuggets. They also have cheesecake which is very expensive and in small containers. Now,  if the food is yummy, the price is not important because good food is worth it. Yet we ordered food that was absolutely awful and paid a whopping $101. For a quesadilla starter, two eggplant parm sandwiches with soggy fries, and absolutely horrible veggie burger, and very small amount of dessert, along with the two juices and a small package of corn tortillas, we paid $101! This is a serious rip off and I don't know how this restaurant continues the way that it does.  We do not plan on trying this restaurant again and we do not recommend it at all. This is literally the worst vegan food I have ever tried. Knowing how good my vegan dishes are at home, the bad food at this restaurant is just disgusting and unacceptable.",

My favorite dish here so far is the lentil loaf sandwich. The 'loaf' is accented perfectly with grilled red bell pepper and a delectable BBQ sauce. I tend to swing between pairing it with the side of potato salad or baked sweet potato waffle fries.  I have tried a few other sandwiches here, none of them bad at all. I'd like to try their brunch soon, as the tofu scrambles and breakfast burritos on their website look amazing.",

Both were delicious and so fresh with many layers of flavor. They were also pretty filling. The avocado fries are so delicious. Seriously such a treat and so cute (they're a little small haha). The outdoor-ish patio (covered but still feels like the outdoors) with the nice fountain has a nice ambience. The servers we had were both very soft spoken and we laughed that it must be a vegan thing (just kidding, of course). I would come here for lunch again for sure, and there is also a little shop in the front with refrigerated vegan cheeses (they all look delicious) and lots of other goods.",

I've never ordered though the Yelp app before, but I must share that it was easy to do and I had no issues with the app or Grubhub, overall I was really pleased with the online order and delivery process.   I ordered a pesto pizza, cheese pizza, and the gluten-free waffle. However, with the delivery and the tip the total was $55, (avg $18 a meal) so a bit more than I originally planned on spending.   The food arrived hot and on time. The gluten-free waffle was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and full flavored. The sauces (chocolate and mixed berries) were perfect complements to the waffle.   The pizza crusts were the softest gluten-free crusts I've ever tasted, and the combination of flavors in the pesto pizza complemented each other nicely. The vegan cheese melted similar to real cheese and the flavor was better than I expected.   It's super nice to find vegan restaurants, and this is definitely a place worth eating at!",

The raw portobello burger with a beet patty is also my favorite! The other day I just tried the cooked fiesta platter and the chili rellanos and jackfruit tacos had the most flavorful sauce and dips. The desserts are delectable - the chocolate truffles are a perfect little bit of sweet. They also sell a full raw chocolate tart.  The environment is very relaxed and laid-back but the owner and all of her staff are very kind, attentive and friendly. The vibes in there are really positive and the food is nourishing, healing and delicious.",

There are amazing desserts as well and a little area near the cashier station where there are some foods & goodies you can take to go.  I got beautiful shampoos, conditioners, body wash and CBD.    This place is a super conscious health foodies dream.  Everyone that works there is very friendly too...you can see it in their eyes and in their presence that they eat well and are healthy too.    5 stars always for Go Vegan and I can't wait to go back to Henderson.

    "text": "I felt the light and love as soon as I walked into this place. The way I'd describe it is like getting a hug from your mama :) I miss it already. I had the \"Classic\" tofu omelette (spinach, red bell pepper, scallions and cheese). Comes with an apple and orange slice, along with a side of breakfast potatoes which included sweet potatoes. OH EM GEE don't let me forget that muffin it came with too. Goodness that was good it had a fruit filling I think it might have been raspberry. I will definitely be coming back maybe every single day :D not kidding. The woman at the cash register told me that they have yoga classes upstairs and if you join you get a discount at the cafe. I will be looking into that ASAP.   P.S. I sat across from a fellow who was eating there for the first time as well but also his first time eating vegan food. He enjoyed everything as much as I did. Vegan or not, I truly encourage giving this sweet cafe a visit.",

I have driven by here many times but was turned off by the weird looking exterior, to me it resembles a office building or something else. But once inside I was impressed it has the vegan restaurant feel that I like with a cozy feel. It features daily pop up specials, a good sized salad bar and a veggie burger that could change my mind about eating hamburgers. I have only been here once but can't wait for my next visit. They post the daily specials on their FB page if you are interested.",

While waiting for rhe asian server to get back at us to ger our orders, my friend took a short video l. She likes posting videos on fb about places she's been to. Then i guess it's the owner/manager(i think he's middle eastern older guy) called my friend out and said you can't take video/film here. He said other people doesn't apreciate to be in a video. Well, no one was inside the cafe except us and that guy and a caucasian guy. There are probably a couple of customers at the patio area outside. Technically no one was in the video. So disappointing. He was rude and raised his voice at my friend. So my friend said sorry and we're just gonna order. Told my friend no we are not ordering. We are leaving . Geez. Why would I give my business to you if u are rude? The places we went to don't mind taking video because they know that's how your business will spread. Free advertising. They even join our selfies. Too bad we weren't able to try the food. But doesn't matter how good the food is, if the customer service is bad then no one will come. Will i ever try to go back? Probably not. Like what they say, first impression last.",

    "text": "I came to eat here about a week ago, and I came because I saw their Veganuary promotion. I ordered the breakfast, that comes with a side of pancakes, and a tofu scramble with vegan sausage and hash browns. I enjoyed the pancakes, but didn't like the rest of the food. I just didn't enjoy the taste, and so I asked if I could switch out my dish for something different. The server prompted the manager to come over, and I expressed to her the same thing. She said I could get something different, but would have to pay for it along with my dish at a 10% discount. Also, she didn't understand why I didn't like the food, and to me it felt like I had offended her by not liking the food. Which everyone has different taste preferences and that's okay. She seemed a bit upset, and it didn't seem right to me that I couldn't get something different and that the discount was so little since I didn't want to eat the food. Earlier before speaking to her about the food, she was very polite, but after it felt to me she was being rude. Personally I won't be returning to eat here since there are many other vegan restaurants I can go to. The lack of communication and customer service towards the end wasn't okay with me. Ultimately I explained all my concerns to the server, didn't eat my food any further which I did not want to eat, and when I went to pay she gave me 20% discount instead. I haven't tried any other food here, and won't be. I felt the experience was just very uncomfortable, too much miscommunication and didn't enjoy the customer service on the end.",

The restaurants dining room itself was far from exciting so it was cool they had an alternative place to dine. Plants, a fountain, and high vaulted ceilings made for a quaint place to have brunch!  Now to the menu... To drink: I got the green zing and although it was tasty, it was centrifugally juiced versus cold pressed and this bummed me out a bit. It's not a BIG deal but it's worth mentioning. Boyfriend got the pina cool-ada and liked it a lot. However, those two drinks alone cost me nearly $20 so I don't think I'll be getting any drinks next time.  To eat: I got the pesto breakfast burrito and it was very very good. The \"eggs\" has great flavor and the pesto was spot on. Just wish for $11 and change this burrito had more bang for the buck.  Boyfriend got the BBQ pulled jack sandwich and was very impressed. He eats meat and tries these places with skepticism but he thoroughly smashed this sandwich. The waffle fries though... They were so stingy. I guess they're weighed out but it was very disappointing.  Overall:  Food= excellent Drinks= good  Portions= lacking Service= excellent Ambiance= outside:good as inside:lacking Price=good",

    "text": "Go Vegan Cafe is absolutely disgusting. Wow. Right upon sitting down the table was dirty with crumbs. Everything is bland, unflavorful, and has a weird after taste. We ordered the enchiladas, the classic burger, and the eggplant parmesan sandwich. The whole environment is unclean and just gross. The enchiladas were terrible, the jackfruit had no flavour and there was a certain taste that was just so unpleasant. The classic burger was not a firm burger and the corn and black beans were not appealing. The fries were bland as well. The only good thing was the eggplant parmesan, but it was so so small. Maybe the waffles or pancakes would've been decent. The environment was just a no. Go to Vegenation downtown if you want good vegan food, if you want shitty ass bland overpriced food come here. Cook your own vegan food at home! This place sucks!!!!!!!!!",

When I responded in Spanish the worker looked at me with a dumb face and said she didn't speak Spanish... I am never returning because I don't think it's okay to judge people, especially when I am trying being healthier.

Not fluffy pancakes, but none the less delicious and my favorite part swimming in syrup!   I had the Mexi Vegan Burger (not the raw one this time) and I thought it was beyond great! Great flavor and the sides of katsup, guac, and salsa were not needed to dress the burger up, but complemented it well. She had the lentil loaf and it too was impressive. Very filling and no left overs!",

We tried the breakfast and both had a Tofu scramble.  Mine a Mexicali with pinto beans, vegan cheese and very fresh guacamole.  Hers was the Spanish with roasted veggies and she added roasted Jalapenos.  Both were excellent and filled us all day:  I'd match these scrambles against any regular egg dishes anytime.   The veggies were fresh and crisp as well as varied and abundant (I think that's enough adjectives for now...)  I recommend asking for the homemade Jalapeno hot sauce.   It is for those who love it hot.   I wanted to take the container home.  We came back specifically to try the dinner menu of enchiladas and BBQ jackfruit sandwich.      The enchilada was very good with fresh Guacamole and a good tortilla.     Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the jackfruit sandwich unless you like enjoy your BBQ bland.   I missed the spicy kick of a good sauce.  Additionally the gluten free roll was chewy.   In their defense I've found very few gluten free bread products that are good.   It's hard to pull off as whatever gluten is, it is delicious.      Please give this place a try as they are hurting with the road construction being done in the area.   We will be back.",

We sat on the outside section covered by a canopy and a water fountain in the middle of it.  We ordered he bbq jackfruit  sandwich and the classic breakfast burrito along with the greenhouse juice. The portions are really small for the price you pay. I understand it's a vegan gluten free cafe so it comes at a price but I've been to multiple vegan cafes in LA who offer similar items with similar prices with much bigger portions. The bbq sandwich was okay. We make these at home so it didn't taste like anything special. The classic breakfast burrito was pretty good tho. Tortilla seemed fresh. It was just way too small though.  The greenhouse juice is pretty good. I would add some raw honey or agave to it. But It is an alkaline drink so it is best in its pure state.  3.5 stars overall. 5 stars for service.",

Each time, I try something new and have an old favorite. It's always fresh, creatively done and delicious. Not what you might expect from vegan food. My favorite -- the fiery sushi roll...INCREDIBLE! And there is a variety of tasty desserts.  The owners are always so nice and the staff so accommodating in our food requests. On the last trip, my friend and I drove 50 miles out of our way just to eat here. And we'd do it again. It's only 4 or 5 miles off the strip but well worth it. The decor is simple in the main area and the atmosphere in the fountain room is better if you don't mind the noise of the water. But don't be mistaken...the quality of the food is top notch and the prices are more than reasonable.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g45963-d10882252-r590656713-Go_Vegan_Cafe-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html&s=79686d84478b671fb166c5784d5aa694bf27ee617876a864b0077452be86200d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

I was a party of two for breakfast on a weekend late morning.   Once I was fed, I noticed how clean and relaxing the space is. Great music. The servers are chill and the one at my table was kind and had a great presence.   She suggested a coffee drink and it was everything she promised and more - with cashew milk.   We had two tofu scrambles. They were beautifully prepared and presented and the portions were generous. Each one come with a muffin. Pretty sure it is gluten free.   Finished with three nibs from behind their display case. Highly recommend.   I go to workout classes in this building and live down the street - I will definitely be coming back to try the salad bar and other menu options. Thank you guys!!  My only criticism is on the pricing. I wish it were a little more affordable - but in their defense, everything is delicious and high quality.",

A little bit of everything everywhere,  from books to juice bar, fridge and self serve buffet in the middle, supplement on the shelves  and seats to eat. I was surprised how this place was dark and  so not welcoming. After seating, the service was good. I order the classic burger, who came in a very timely manner in a plastic plate with very cheap silverware. The burger was tasteless and very fulfilling.. the outside veranda was full of dusty plastic plants.... this place need a new owner with a different vision. Vegan is not what is used to be and can be so much better. Price of my burger was $15.35",

I loved the huge gluten free menu. The kids had the cinnamon apple waffle. I tried it and it was great sweet and candied with fresh fruit on top. I had the raw portobello mushroom sandwich. I was disappointed in it because it was way over salted. It had a good flavor with the pesto sauce on the heavy grain bread if I could get past the salt on the portobello marinate it would have been good. My son had a vegan burger the consistency of the meat substitute was really nice and felt like real burger meat the only negative is that it was salty as well.   They had a lot of interesting items on the menu like tamales and fresh pressed coffee plus lots of juices.",

    "text": "I am not a Vegan by any stretch of the imagination, so my knowledge of this foodie world is lacking, with that being said, I found the food here to be very flavorful and filling.   Walking-in it's very plain on the inside, looking like a half finished school cafeteria with a small grocery section selling vegan or vegetarian products. I sat down and realized I was the only person in here, which can be creepy. The menu is overwhelming, as there's a lot to choose from, to make matters worse, I wasn't really given any guidance on how to tackle it, so I went with the Lentil Loaf sandwich and the Roasted Veggie quesadilla.   The Lentil Loaf was good, but a little on the dry side. It needed some type of sauce to moisten it up. The menu said it comes with BBQ sauce, but there was little to no sauce on this sammie. This was very filling and if you're looking for heavy meal, this is a good option.   The Roasted Veggie Quesadilla had a lot more flavor, but it was greasy! Like needing to wash my hands after every bite, greasy. There was cheese on this, dairy free cheese, and to be honest, the difference wasn't ultra noticeable and I actually liked it. The roasted veggies still had a snap to them and a little heat that slowly escalated with every bite. Good stuff!  The design and the service here needs a huge upgrade, I only received one glass of water, which I had to ask for and was checked on only twice during the entire meal. Go Vegan needs to work on these things if they want to prosper in their not so great location.",

Of course I said Yes, I've Been wanting to try this place out as well.   They have indoor and \"outdoor\" seating and they sell vegan products within as well.  We were seated at a booth and ordered:  Mexi Burger: Veggie patty w/roasted pasilla peppers, melted Daiya cheese, and slaw. (Also added the roasted jalapenos!) Side of Pico de gallo and guacamole. Side of spicy sweet potato fries, included.   Classic grilled cheese sandwich w/potato salad, included: blend of Daiya cheeses.   Hunnie Bunnie loved her potato salad and the grilled cheese was nice and cheesey for her! Thumbs up for sure!   My burger was delicious as well! I cut it in half and tried to eat it with my hands but ended up eating with a fork and knife. It was a bit messy but tastey so who cares! And the roasted jalapenos added a nice kick to it.   We both agree that fake \"meat\" isn't really the business and they have great options here that don't include soy \"chicken\" and whatever else... Lots of fresh ingredients. All raw options and cooked items on the menu. We will definitely come here again! NOM NOM!",

Plus it's the best kind of takeout ever, since you don't have to worry about it getting cold. ;)  There are \"raw\" and just vegan items available- the raw burgers (portabello on nut patty!) and collard wraps (mexican and italian-style!) are my favorites though, both served with avocado \"fries\". If you want a liquid lunch, they have a massive selection of smoothies and shakes, as well as fresh young coconuts.  Location is a bit odd: you cash out at the hostess stand rather than the back bakery counter or the large ground counter where the staff sit. There's a huge salad bar ($9/lb) in the middle of the dining room with a small supplement shop area to the right, and the \"small talk garden\" area to the back. There's just a lot going on and not much in the way of decor. I guess all their focus and energy are busy in the kitchen!",

And, very few of them have soy in them, which is good for me (as I am allergic to soy) as well as people in general who are looking for something other than soy-based meat-substitute dishes that strike me more as gimmicks than serious dishes.  I had the spicy raw burger nut patty. Full of flavor, and filling--emphasis on filling; I came in pretty hungry and left completely filled up. The balance on the dish is also tremendous--no single flavor is overwhelming. The bun is a bit tough, so I ended up eating it separately; it's filled enough that picking it up and biting it is a bit inconvenient.   They also have some desserts that look good, but I was too full to try one. The service was friendly and the person who took my order explained several dishes.  I'd definitely recommend it, to both herbivores and omnivores.",

The one that attracted me most was their eggplant parmigiano. I saw loaded pictures and review about it.   I came in and i fell in love with its atmosphere. The outside fountain was soothing to hear while looking their menu. I see myself coming here to do work or study. The people who work were very welcoming and friendly. The lady made sure i was comfortable and helped me on picking out what to get. Originally came here for the eggplant sandwich but i was also drawn to their enchilada dish! Her and a few workers also recommended the dessert area. Did i got up and checked it out? I sure did. Got me some truffles!   Ended up with the eggplant parmigiano and i must say it was great. My order wasn't as loaded as the ones i've seen in pictures. My eggplant wasn't fully baked which was sort of how to chew. It was okay though. Overall it filled me up. The waffle cut fries were seasoned to the point, i wanted more.  Then again, i had to refuse because i had truffles waiting for me.",

The service is a little long but that is because their food is so fresh. They also have a salad bar which has more than just salads. They have multiple dessert options as well. They are conveniently located so this is my GO-TO spot for meetups with my friends. You feel like you are at home with the service! There is not anything on the menu that disappointed me!

I picked the pulled BBQ jackfruit sandwich as I have had this sandwich before at a different restaurant. The spices added to this sandwich were very unique and bursting with flavor!!   The restaurant itself has a very odd setup and a bit confusing if you walk in from the side/back? entrance. The restaurant has a smoothie bar, (with a very unfriendly man working it), a little health section \"grocery store\", and a salad bar that feels very out of place.   Our server was extremely nice and you can't beat the price of healthy food. Good food that won't break the bank!",

    "text": "I stopped by to check this out per recommendation of a new friend who's vegan/veg. It's always nice to go to a place where I know that there are things my son can eat. It's a rather large place, with a register in the very front, a long salad bar (think Whole Foods) in the middle, some tables and big, comfy booths. There's also a small dessert case and some books, snacks and supplements for purchase. All vegan.  Before stopping in, I checked out the menu so I was pretty sure of what we wanted- just a snack to share and a smoothie. We ordered the Cheese Fries and a large Berry Good smoothie. The portion was small. Extremely small, for $8. As was the $8 smoothie. I would have hated to see what the actual small smoothie size looked like.  We got 2 or 3 normal sized waffle fries and the rest were like the remnants in the bottom of the bag, which only took up 1/3 of a small salad plate. They weren't crispy. At all. In fact, and I even hate to say it, but they were soggy. The vegan cheese was melted (as much as it can be). It was like they put them in a microwave. I buy the Alexia waffle fries and the same vegan cheeses they have, and use them on a daily basis, so I know what's up.. My son, who's the fry king, didn't even want to eat them. That might not really mean anything to you, but that speaks volumes to me. He's legit a fry critic. If they are actually good, he'll wolf them down. But he doesn't like soggy fries. Sorry. The pico and guac were meh. It seemed like there wasn't anything on the plate that was made in house. But there were micro greens decorating the plate.  The smoothie was good. It's hard to mess up a smoothie though. But for $8, I can't believe at how small it was. I'm going to give them another shot because I do really want to like it and it's somewhere that can accommodate all of our families food allergies/intolerances.",

Ordered the Eggplant Parmesan and boyfriend got the Mexi Burger and some pancakes with mango, pineapple and coconut topping. Everything was so good, my Parmesan eggplant was DELICIOUS!!! I will definitely be back more often to try the rest of the menu! I love how much variety in food they have. Overall, it was a great experience and definitely worth trying out!",

Loved the fact that it's vegan comfort food, wow wow wow!!!   Ordered lentil loaf, mexi burger and gluten free pancakes with spicy mango nut mix on top. Damn good!!   Mexi burger comes with roasted peppers, slaw and daiya cheese on a gluten free bun..so excellent. Came with  side of  guac, ketchup and pico... Incredible. Lentil loaf did not disappoint either. Very hearty, savory and yummy yummy. Comes with pan fried potato awesomeness. No left overs from this food adventure, that's how yummy it was.  Didn't love the gf pancakes, they were a bit on the mushy side, but I think u can only do so much with vegan AND gluten free. Taste-wise, they were a win, just not in love with the texture..  Either way, meal was amazing. A Vegan, vegetarian or carnivore could fall in love with this spot, so give it a try. Can't wait to come back.",

The place was pretty empty but that didn't matter to me. I had looked online at the menu and decided on the Asian burger with waffle fries. I got my food to go since I only live 5 minutes away by car.  When I opened the to go box the food looked really good. The only negative upon first look was there were very few fries. The few fries in the box were crisp and delicious. The burger was SO GOOD...but the only negative I will give it was that the bun COMPLETELY fell apart on both the bottom and top from being just slightly wet from the condiments. Literally impossible to eat this burger with my hands, I had to grab a fork and knife to try and eat the rest.",
