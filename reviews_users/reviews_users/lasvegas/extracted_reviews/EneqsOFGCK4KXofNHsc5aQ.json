I think the burgers at In-N-out taste really good with the veggies being fresh. I like the service too and how they ask if I want onions with the burger. I don't and I usually forget to order without onions at order burger joints. So I just remove them. The shakes are good too but i usually order the secret menu one. Over all, I think they have the best value burger with the freshest ingredients. Shakes too!",

Service was fast for the amount of people there. The price was also reasonable (although heard it's a little more than an average location) as it's a strip location. I got the cheeseburger combo but should have gone with the double for a more filling burger. Great quality burger and fries though. While the fries tasted better here than five guys, I'd overall say five guys is better. More customization and larger burger and fry portions. It comes very close though and will easily eat here again anytime I'm back. A must stop place to eat for any coming to the West Coast who haven't experienced it before. Fast and tasty food at a reasonable price on the strip can't be beat.",

I have studied the secret menu and been filled with tales of deliciousness from friends who went to college on the west coast or people who have visited on vacations. Unfortunately this experience fell way flat of those in my dreams. This is a pretty  standard, slightly better fast food burger place that maybe was a trail blazer but now is just one in the crowd with places like smashburger, meatheads, whataburger, 5 Guys etc... I got a double double animal style. It was fine for a late night snack. But tasted pretty much like your standard griddled double cheeseburger with thousand island like spread on it. The fries were just bad. Soggy not very salty and the melted slice of american cheese solidified quickly at my table. Unappealing and not tasty at all. The chocolate milkshake I had was the best part. Super thick and was able to withstand the heat walking back to are hotel.",

I ordered a simple cheeseburger meal but added the special sauce to it. The best part of the sandwich was the soft and crusty buttery bun. They take the extra step to toast the inside bun which adds the perfect light crunch. The fries were good not extraordinary. I also tased the fries animal style - it was too rich and heavy for my tastes but I liked the flavor combinations of the melted cheese with special sauce with the fries.  I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a fast food restaurant with good, quality fresh burgers.",

French fries were just ok.  I had a double cheeseburger and my wife had a cheeseburger and a shake. Overall it was good but we would probably pass if it was a 20minute wait. Also, this location is at the back of the Linq area.  There was no seating in-or-out of this location so we ate by a nearby fountain.  We'll go back but not on a weekend.",

Being that it's in Vegas there were TONS of people here so you can imagine they had orders coming every second. The workers here took care of everyone and no mistakes from what I witnessed. The service was only surpassed by the quality of food. Everything I ordered came out not just hot but fresh and succulent. Because of this I visited every day I was in Vegas. Keep up the good work guys much appreciated from us travelers who can't have your food as often as we would like!",

The line is non-stop & never ending, but those cashiers and cooks keep things moving!   I ordered the Animal Style Fries. The fries were not the crispy, but maybe this is an In-N-Out signature. I did devour the entire tray because the sauce & caramelized onions will not stop calling your name.   I am a non-meat eater so there are basically zero options if you are looking for a veggie burger here - just FYI.",

I literally went five times during Memorial Day weekend lol.  Burgers are A1. So good that I was willing to smuggle 50 of them on my flight...but TSA wasn't having it bahaha. ;)   I will say that I wasn't a big fan of the fries. Both the animal style and regular style tasted like NOTHING to me...like empty potatoes if that makes sense.   Additionally, this location is pricer than others in Vegas, but I guess it's all about location.   Yum yum yum for dem burgers thoooo. Yes lawd.",

Lines move very fast and efficiently and the food is cooked to order. This particular location is very busy and a great late night offering after a day or night of enjoying what Vegas has to offer.

We ordered 2. One came just enough to fill the fries bowl. The other was only half full. For those who love In-N-Out, you know they are generous with their fries.

This location is like going to the concession stand at the circus on any given day but no matter the crowds or how long the wait I'm not walking past it. It's rare that I see a security guard at the entrance to a burger joint but there's one here and it appears he's sampling what he's paid to protect or at least paid to open the door for the crowds.  I don't know if this is the best fast food burger on planet earth but it rivals any I've eaten at and I think I've tried most of the most popular ones at least once. There's no doubt this is a popular walk up location and although the wait can be long the food will be served hot and fresh. The dine in area is relatively small but there are a few tables outdoors and also a concrete wall out front that some choose to take advantage of, if this is an option you chose be prepared to share with the pigeons they are very friendly and bold so protect your burger and share your fries...",

Our number was in the latter part of the 40's and they were on their 20's. We waited around for a while to get our order as the 20's passed, 30's passed, 40's passed, 50's passed... wait what? Where is my order? I went up to the pick up counter and waited a little bit before i asked if they called 48 yet?   The lady that helped me checked the back and found my order stashed with all the other upper number of to-go bags. We walked to the Linq to meet up with my friends and ate our meal. The burger weren't even warm (The Linq is literally across the way and the temperature outside was well over 100 degrees). The fries were super cold that we didn't even touch it. This tells me that they totally forgot to call out my order number and was sitting there for a long time for.

And as far as seating goes the 3 times I was there on my trip (all at various hours in the evening) I had no problem finding a seat (both inside and out.)

    "text": "I FINALLY was able to try In-N-Out burger last night!!!! There is a new location in the Linq Promenade, located between the Linq and Flamingo hotels. It was exactly what I needed after about 7 hrs of traveling.  The Good: This is a popular place, but the line moved swiftly. The employee who took our order was very nice and happy!! It's a pleasant change from the sterotypical down-trodden fast food worker.  In order to get the real In-N-Out experience, you must google the secret menu. I ordered the Flying Dutchman with lettuce and tomato (a double cheeseburger minus the buns), Joe had a double double animal style (a double cheese burger with their sauce, onions, pickles), and an order of cheese fries lite well (fries cooked just a little longer so they are crisper with 2 slices of American cheese on top).  Oh my gosh, the food was so fresh and so delicious!!! Our meal costs $12.02. That is a STEAL for a meal for 2 in Vegas that isn't McDonald's!  Could improve:  Knowing you have to look up the secret menu for the full experience.... or else you are getting just a plain hamburger/cheeseburger.  Cleanliness in the dining area. It's not that the resturant was totally unclean, it's just that this resturant was hoppin' and there was a lot of foot traffic, and some people don't clean up after themselves. There were several employees running around and cleaning up, so they were definitley trying!  Also, some chili on those fries would have been tasty ;)  The bad: Nothing!!!  Overall: In-N-Out lived up to the hype for me, however I have learned to keep my expectations low when anything is hyped up.  I will most likely be getting food there again before I return to my In-N-Outless state if Wisconsin.",

The chocolate shake was also very good. My only complaint is that the fries, while tasty, were a tad undercooked, hence the one star deduction. Highly recommended.",

I assumed oh well it's on the strip it's going to be overpriced and slammed in there. Sure enough I was right about one thing. They are slammed. Surprisingly it's the same price as any other In-N-out. My boyfriend came on a Tuesday around 2 o clock this place was busy. No seats to sit inside or out but we got our food fast. Service was really great and efficient. The decor in here I love. There is a clean red and white theme with the little palm trees all over the wall and the outside is bright and neon like any good place is in Las Vegas. We got our usual two doubles with animal fries and a chocolate shake. The food was hot and fresh! My fries were nice and crispy with lots of spread. Definitely coming back to this location",

    "text": "I had heard a lot about In-N-Out Burger so I was quite eager to try it while we were in Vegas.  To be honest I was a bit skeptical as I've eaten at a lot of burger places in my life and I hear all the time about how great some shops like In-N-Out Burger are but they rarely live up to the hype.  A good burger is a pretty rare thing, a truly fantastic burger is almost unheard of in my opinion.  So one night after a night of fun in Vegas the wife and I decided to try In-N-Out Burger finally.  We arrived late in the night, after many a drinks, and stood in a pretty long line.  Thankfully the line moved very quickly so it wasn't long before it was our turn to order.  I ordered the animal style burger and some fries and the wife got the same.  After waiting about five minutes or so our order came out.  There was a lot of people in the restaurant but we were able to find a spot.    I was pretty impressed with just how truly tasty the burger looked in it's little container and the fries were very tasty looking as well.  It didn't take long before I ate a few of those and wow, they were really good!  Very crispy and not too oily. Very much like the king of fries: McDonalds.  I am not a \"fry guy\" so for me to like fries is almost unheard of.  Nearly everywhere aside from McDonalds I never get fries (Burger King=onion rings, Wendy's=chili, etc).  But finally it was time to actually taste the burger and I was blown away by the explosion of flavor.  The animal sauce wasn't quite like 1,000 Island or Big Mac Sauce or anything like I thought it'd taste.  It is really difficult to describe, but I will say it was delicious and I loved it.  Will definitely have to get that on the fries next time.    So to say I love In-N-Out Burger is an understatement.  The wife loved it as well.  We honestly were tempted to go back again the next night and came very close to doing so but ultimately our desire to try some new places won out.  I sort of hope they never get these in Ohio or I may end up gaining about 10 pounds a month from pigging out on their food.  A must try, I am definitely coming back here for a burger next time I'm in Vegas or any other place that has In-N-Out Burger!",

No burgers, no shakes, just some extra crispy fries with cheese, onions and sauce on top. We patiently waited over 25 minutes before my husband went up and asked someone the status of our fries. The guy behind the counter was amused for some reason, as he laughed in my husband's face and stammered like a burn out \"well, you see, the thing is... uh, there was like... a disagreement on what well done was?\" What the heck does that mean?? The manager comes over and asks what's going on, and come to find out they burned my fries, threw those ones out, then just forgot about our order all together! Not ok! Took us about 45 minutes to get just one order of animal fries. The employees obviously don't care to live up to the In N Out standards.",

    "text": "#51 for 2018  Located in the LINQ, this is one of the largest In and Outs I've been to.  The lines were long but processed quickly.  It helps if you know what you want.  There are tables outside but nobody wanted them with temperatures over 100 degrees.  All the tables inside were occupied.  I placed the order while Gabriel stood close to the seating area ready to rush in for a table.  Not sure if the girl taking my order just came in because she was cheery as can be.  Not.  Maybe over whelmed 1st day on the job with the heat and the endless line of customers.  I'm surprised it didn't go out the door.  She took my order with some difficulty because the  noise level was so high. She did confirm my order of a 4x4, dbl dbl and animal fries. I also asked to load them up  with everything especially the fried onions.  I then walked over to the other side of the seating area.  This way we had both sides covered hoping we would get seats soon.  Then It happened.  A table vacated and I swooped in before the last person got out placing my rightful clam on the table.  Gabriel came over sat down while I loaded up on napkins, ketchup and those delicious hot peppers.  I was proud to have this moment with Gabriel, my son.  Having his 1st 4x4 and animal fries.  I wasn't sure if he'd be able to eat it all.  I know I can't that's why I just had a dbl dbl.  Well,  he did finish it all proving he is a carnivore.    Something about the taste of these burgers just keeps everyone coming back.  Clean, pure and feels healthy with the tomatoes and lettuce.  It's how I would make it at home but not as good.  Well, you don't have to go off the strip any more to get your secret menu craving.",

Lines and crowds on a Sunday evening looked daunting but the wait was surprisingly short less than expected anyway.  As I've written in some of my In N Out reviews - the first time I had one of their burgers over twenty years ago I thought it was the best thing ever but since then the experience has varied and it's never been quite as good as that first time (maybe it never was quite that good and it's just a rose colored nostalgic memory :-).  Come to think of it - a recent burger I had at Holstein's at the Cosmopolitan (Rising Sun burger) was probably the best burger I've ever had at a restaurant but then that was 18.50 and a double double at this In N Out was 4.45 so can't really compare fairly.",

When we arrived, the line was well outside the door, but we only ended up waiting about 15 minutes total time from when we got in line to when we received our food. They are used to big crowds and the staff is well prepared. The bigger trick is finding a table if you're planning on eating at the restaurant. What we found most people doing was having one person stay in line to order and the other start scouting out seating. A table will open up, you just need to be patient. The food was excellent, as usual. We got double-doubles and fries \"animal style,\" trust me, having the fries \"animal style\" is a must. The next time I'm in Vegas, you can bet I'll be back!",

I was greeted by a homeless man exiting with his fly down and his junk exposed.  The staff was super busy, the location was packed at 10:00 am, and there was trash on the tables, overflowing from the bins, and food crumbs on the floor.  My first thought was that I had made a huge mistake.  Well, it wasn't as bad as expected as the staff got to work and quickly got things under control.  We eventually found a table that was semi-clean for our food and snarfed it down before departing the place to clean up.  Would repeat again only if hung over.",

Also, they don't panic, remain calm despite being it very busy and heavy with traffic  Food - Ordered a regular hamburger and french fries (classic item) as it was my first time - Overall, it's a pretty plain, simple burger - Patty was done well, a little dry, but it didn't give me any 'wow' factor at all - Cheese and lettuce compliment well - Burger size standard size (around a hand palm) - Fries are pretty regular as well, not much with a 'wow' factor as well  I'm not entirely sure what's the overall hype is for In-n-Out. Price value wise it's very cheap (~$6). I guess for a quick snack or late night food, it might be quite comforting. But I would prefer Shake Shack more than this.",

The order of fries was enough to share.  This would have been great, if the fries were good.  The  fries were dry and tasted like dehydrated potatoes.  Between the two of us, we only ate half of the order and it was not because we were full. Looking around, we were not the only ones who did not care for the fries.

I mean its probably the freshest, fast food burger chain in the west coast. I get that so many people may hype up things for you, but its always good. I've never had In N Out and be disappointed. For me its nostalgic, coming in with my family and having a good meal and times.   So if you don't already know, yes there is a secret menu. What I have discovered is that it really isn't a secret anymore. If you don't know its because you probably moved from out of town and don't know how it works or you're just lame... jk. I remember how I reacted my first time I saw someone eat animal style fries(fries covered in melted cheese, house spread, and grilled onions.) AMAZING! Must try if you've never had them. You can pretty much order the burgers or fries to your liking, temperature, style, add ons, etc.   I remember ordering the 4x4 and just not being able to complete my fries and drink. It was quite a mouth full. For me its the #1, Double Double with onions and add pickles. This is what its all about. I love you In N Out. Never stop being you.",

After hearing so much praise about it (especially that it was comparable to Shake Shack) I had such high expectations for it, which weren't met at all! The fries are so unbearably dry. I thought the sauce from the Animal Style fries would help, but I personally don't like the chipotle mayonnaise/ onion taste. The burger is fine, but also on the drier side. The shake doesn't have any texture! Overall disliked the food, but I did like the cheap price point and atmosphere of this location, especially with the outdoor seating. I would compare In-N-Out to a McDonald's or Burger King.",

I ordered the cheeseburger and fries with a drink. I believe it came to $8 which wasn't bad.  So as I receive my food, I was lucky enough to find a seat on the patio because it was crowded. The first bite I take was the French fries and they were very crispy. I thought it was a couple but no it was 80% of my fries. I don't know if that's what it was supposed to be like but I didn't have the patience to wait in line for a new batch. I then took a bite in the burger and it was pretty good. Very fresh.

A few days ago, I paid three times the price for a famous chef's burger.

To find something as cheap and good as this on the strip is definitely a win-win. Single burgers are a little under 4$, while doubles are a little under 5$.  There is also a secret option that is not so secret anymore. I heard a lot of people mention \"animal style\" which is some special sauce with fried onions and cheese. You're able to add this with your burger or your fries. To be honest, I didn't think that it was all that. I was thinking gains... try it tho before you stick to the yummy basic order menu",

Great, I thought. But the wait really wasn't bad, less than 10 minutes. There were no tables open inside but I sat by the fountain that is right outside so I didn't mind. The seating situation is the reason for the 4 stars as it is clear that small of a space won't seat enough guests. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars because I love the food.

    "text": "I've eaten at In-N-Out Burger before when I was in Las Vegas (required me to drive from my Strip hotel) but this location is the first (and currently only) In-N-Out located on the Strip. It opened somewhat recently (less than 1 month ago). People are always comparing In-N-Out (West Coast) with Shake Shack (East Coast) and now that In-N-Out is located on the Strip, people can enjoy both while strolling on the Strip.  This In-N-Out is located in the Linq Promenade area.  When I went in, I was immediately greeted by people behind the cash register. I wasn't sure what I wanted yet so I didn't line up. After I quickly looked at the items advertised above the cash register and decided to get a double burger combo. The prices seemed higher than \"normal\" but I would assume that it is because it is on the Strip. I asked for the animal style fries (which isn't shown on the menu on the top of the cash register). I was handed a cup so went to the soft drink dispenser to get my drink. I opted for Dr. Pepper since they didn't have the soft drink that I normally prefer which is Coke Zero. After a few minutes, they called out my number and I went to get my tray.  Even though there wasn't much of a line-up to order, the sit-in area was almost completely filled. I managed to get a seat when someone left. Cellphone reception was somewhat spotty inside the restaurant (I'm with T-Mobile) but the restaurant did have free wireless so I was able to update my status of Facebook as well as include pictures of my meal on social media.  When I finished my meal, I went to refill my drink and asked where the washroom/toilette was in the place and one of the employees informed me that there wasn't one inside the restaurant and I had to either go inside the casino or go to the public washroom within the Linq Promenade. Not knowing where the public washroom is within the Linq Promenade was located, I opted to walk to the casino to use the washroom and wash my hands since my burger was messy (but delicious).  Them not having a washroom inside the restaurant and their prices being higher than \"normal\" are the reasons why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars.",

    "text": "The late 1940s saw the birth of two icons. In 1946, the first Las Vegas Strip mega resort the Flamingo opened. Two years later the First In N Out opened in 1948. Fast forward 71 years after the first Strip mega resort & 69 years after the first In N Out there was finally a link connecting the two icons. This link is spelled Linq. A couple of weeks ago, the Linq made headlines when this location opened as the very first In N Out on the Las Vegas Strip.     The first In N Out on the Strip is drawing in the crowds. And the demand is exceeding supply. The famous red, white, & yellow colors adorn a an average size eatery. During peak times there are insufficient  booths and patio tables. This was the case last time when I left disappointed. In hindsight I could of ordered to go then walked nearby to the Wildlife Habitat to have an In N Out picnic in the company of flamingos, ducks, and exotic birds.     The next week it was a different situation. On a rainy day we experienced the sunshine of In N Out when startlingly there were vacant booths. In N Out is fast food sunshine on a cloudy day & anyday. I have yet to see a gloomy employee in their restaurants. During the grand opening era, employees opened and closed the door for me. Now if I needed to use a restroom they would open and close the door for me because there are no restrooms leaving me  to use the public  one in the Linq. Across from the door in the open kitchen there were at least 29 employees greeting customers and creating the food.     Comparable to all In N Outs ordering is done with ease. The menu features 3 burger items that include lettuce, tomato, onions, & a thousand island style sauce. They are also offered as combos that include a medium Coke beverage and fries. The prices are higher than the other locations yet a bargain for the Strip. My cheeseburger combo came to less than $10 around the price of a beer on the Strip. It was $ well spent. Contrary to its namesake the food is never \"In N Out\" of a microwave or fryer. It was freshly made from the time of order causing a good few minutes of anticipation. The In N Out sunshine that permeated the delicious burger & fries was worth it.      In conclusion I anticipate a perpetual extraordinary busy In N Out. I foresee patronizing the local In N Out and leaving the a booth for the out of towner that craves In N Out. Now if there are a few available tables, there will be one for this local when he is craving In N Out.",

    "text": "Great burger. Lives up to its hype with the succulent double-double cheeseburger. This was my second time at an In-N-Out and I was not disappointed. The burger is juicy, consisted, and feels of quality despite this being categorized as fast-food. One thing is I tried to like the 'animal style' fries (ordered it two times now), but it is not good and a bit overrated. The price of the animal fries are about the same as a double-double and does not satisfy me. The dressing makes it soggy and sticky and I generally prefer the regular cut fries to be able to add to my burger or add on ketchup to it. Ordering the animal fries also added an additional 12-15 minute of wait for me which was a bit annoying.   In-N-Out is great and hope it makes it out to the Midwest in the future!",

It's certainly better than McDonalds, but it's basically the same level as a Five Guys or a Steak n Shake.  Higher end (but not quite gourmet) burger places.  I almost gave it a 3-star just because it doesn't meet the hype level everyone places on it, but that seems unfair.  If you want a great burger, go here.  If you need to do it because you've always heard about it, go here.  But don't make the trip because you expect some mecca of burgers - you'll be disappointed!",

This isn't my first time at one, but it definitely has been a while.  This location is in the Linq Promenade.  It's terribly busy.  That's why I gave it 3 Stars.  Just sheer busyness makes it a bit annoying.  The food as always is top notch.  The burgers are delicious and the fries are as always very good.  Getting a seat is a bit of a chore.  Also, once you order, however long it took you to get to the register, double that time waiting for your food.  It is what it is, but honestly it's a good bargain for the Strip and a tasty meal.",

I was not disappointed and it beats any of the burgers you'd get at the usual fast food joints.  I enjoyed my experience and wish they'd expand out to the east coast.  Maybe one day!",

I saw last October when I was in Vegas that they were opening one on the Strip, in the Linq/High Roller area, so I was very excited about that.  I was looking for more of a snack today, so the only thing I got was a hamburger, animal style. I love that they marinate it in extra sauce when you ask for that and they also add chopped onions on top. The hamburger was delicious and I wish we had this chain closer to me.  This location does lose one star for me because it didn't have any bathrooms, as far as I could tell. I had to backtrack to the Linq and find a bathroom to use after my meal, instead. Also, they need more seating, I was lucky to get a booth but a lot of people were eating outside due to the lack of seating inside.  That being said, In-N-Out is delicious and my burger was very good.",

Cute concept and decent service, but I was expecting so much more. Do not get suckered into thinking that this is something great. As a matter of fact, skip it.

I have to say I absolutely loved as I bit into a tasty roasted bun, felt the cold and totally delicious tomato on my tongue, then made it into the crunchy pile of lettuce. So far I totally got the appeal. Then I just never really tasted the burger or cheese. I looked around for the burger flavor and it just blended into or was overshadowed by the rest of the sandwich. Now, I absolutely loved the rest of the sandwich, but I am a burger fan and wanted to taste the burger. The fries were very bland snd I didn't sense any real flavor from the potato. I did get the salt, but it didn't help the flavor profile.   I did find the service to be good, and liked the atmosphere. It was crowded, but I found the end of a table and shared it with strangers. Had fun sharing travel stories while we ate. Awesome!",

After all these years, I will still go out of my way, plan my day, and not care what I weigh to have an Animal-style Double-Double Cheeseburger with an order of In-N-Out Fries Well Done.  This Las Vegas Strip location (near the High Roller Ferris Wheel at the Linq) is just as busy as all the In-N-Outs in Southern California. Our wait time for an open seat was about 5 minutes after getting our burgers. My recommendation is to grab a table or seat as quickly as possible after walking in while someone else in your party orders.  The delay to pig out was worth it though because In-N-Out Burger remains the best Hamburger and Fries at this price point. Obviously, there are a zillion choices of what to eat in Vegas, but if you want pure inexpensive comfort food then there really is nothing like getting the most comfortable of them all: In-N-Out Burger.",

Encountered so many eateries and shops along the way to the roller coaster/zip line.  Lo and behold. In & Out Hamburgers.  Across from the Linq Hotel. Its was Friday around noon during Valentine,President day weekend.  Not too crowded since it rained all day long the day before. Walkin only, no drive thru. Only a few minutes to go thru the ordering queue.  But 5min wait for my special order pickup since I ordered my burger with extra veges and no added salt.  The pickup area was congested with people waiting for their orders and the drink fountains. My burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Prices are just 25 cent - $1 more than the normal.  But not those exorbitant hotel casino strip prices.  Plenty of tables inside and out.  Or just ask and share a table.  I don't bite.  The staff is constantly clearing and cleaning the tables.   Please don't feed the pigeons.  They develope a bad habit and become those unwanted guests you can't get rid of.",

The reason for the four stars are because their fries are more like those canned potato sticks and their milkshakes, at least the chocolate, are just bland.  I loved the burgers.  I had the double-double.  The first time, I had it with tomato and grilled onions. I'm glad the cashier told me that grilled onions was an option.  The tomatoes, however, were refrigerator cold and I don't like the taste of a cold tomato next to a warm burger.  So I left off the tomato the second time and it was awesome.",

    "text": "In-N-Out is always 5 star consistent goodness. Wherever we find a place, you always know you're going to get a good meal. They have always managed to keep their food fresh and deliver it just the way I want it... animal style.  I suppose most people reading the reviews are going to be those who have never been before (because those who are regulars will have already ordered their 4x4 animal style with animal style fries and a neopolitan shake). The first step is to understand that they have burgers at pretty much whatever size you want. They through in fresh lettuce, tomatoes and a secret dressing (which is likely a spin off of thousand island). The cheese is perfection and the patties are always so moist. For those of us with a wide mouth, this burger is for you. For others, it may be a challenge until you have squished your burger into a manageable size.  You look at the menu and you see burger, fries, drinks and shakes. Yup that's about it until you discover the secret menu that everyone talks about. Google it, is my advice. Animal style will give you grilled onions/cheese/extra dressing that you can add to both your burger or your fries. Neopolitan shake blends all the flavors of ice cream together into a wonderful milkshake. They can also do a patty for your dog, remove the buns for those on low carb and add extra patties who want a larger meal than just a double double. They will also do a grilled cheese which is essentially vegetarian.  Go early because as soon as lunch time comes around they are hopping. Before this location by the Linq opened up, we used to have to run across a lot of traffic to get to the other. Thank goodness this opened up on the strip! We were able to grab a meal before we hopped on the plane. Needless to say the calories we ate that morning lasted us all the way until the evening time! Always a winner. Always delicious.",

Conveniently located at The Linq Promenade, In-N-Out is a hot spot with a line that can be a long zig-zag. However, the line moves quickly, and everything else is a speedy process too since the staff stays on top of their game. Despite the heavy traffic, the store stays pretty clean since there is always someone running around bussing tables and sweeping the floor. Seating is available inside and also out on the patio, and people are constantly coming and going so it will not take you long to find a seat.   If you are new to In-N-Out, the menu is simple. There is the hamburger and its few variations: cheeseburger and double-double. Pair that with some fries and a soda or shake, and you have a meal. There are also some secret menu items, but it is no secret since everyone knows them. Like stated on the menu, ordering is as easy as 1-2-3. Though simple, the burgers are amazing. The bread is perfectly toasted. The cheese is perfectly melted. The burger patty is perfectly thin yet juicy. Everything is fresh and made-to-order.   In-N-Out Burger ranks among the best burgers out there. Some call it their favorites while others beg to differ. I call it my favorite. People come from afar to In-N-Out for a reason. Try it yourself and determine if it is the best burger out there.",

So when we visited Vegas for the weekend and having one right next to our hotel (The Flamingo) it was a sign that it was time for me to finally try my first in and out.    First off the inside was nothing special, it was super busy and they did a good job keeping it clean.  I have to say, I was a little worried when I walked in because there were so many people.  But wow, do they know how to put out the food!!! They must have had 20 people working while we were there and they do push the food out efficiently.  I got the Double Double and my wife and daughter each got just a plan cheeseburger.  Weill I can now say that I have finally had an In and Out Burger and it did not disappoint.  I thought it was a really good burger, and I enjoyed their fries too.  Bottom line, they need to open one in Milwaukee!!!",

I had the double double and fries (not animal style).  What I got was a double double animal style and soggy fries.  The burger is way oversauced and super messy.  The taste pretty good but I don't think it is anything ridiculous that I haven't had at other decent burger chains.  The fries should definitely be ordered well done as another yelper suggested.  Mine were soggy and lack luster.    I'm not one for crowds or lines for burgers and fries...but that is just me.",

Instead, everything runs so smoothly, staff is so nice and friendly, and the food is great.  To that extent, I would say that the food is better here than at other locations by comparison. Very hungry the other night and ordered a 4 x 4 with mustard grilled into the patties, well-done fries and a chocolate strawberry shake. Absolutely hit the spot, only took about 15 minutes if that and the burger especially was exceptional.  I only wish that other Vegas entities, from restaurants to shopping, could replicate this experience. All too often, Vegas almost 2019 takes its visitors and customers for granted assuming they can't go anywhere else and will take whatever they get. In-N-Out is the exception in delivering stellar food and service...very much appreciated.",

I wanted a nice brunch....I planned for the Venetian, but it didn't happen for reasons beyond my control. I decided that since we wanted to try In and Out Burger this was as good a time as any.   The very long line moves quickly. I was so surprised. There is a fairly decent wait for the actual food to come out but it's not unbearable.   Now for the food!!! Yummy squared. Since I missed breakfast, I got a double double with fries. The burger was fresh and juicy. Well cooked. Tasty without accompaniment and filling. The fries were super salty, but not so bad if you skipped the ketchup.   The only negative was that sitting outside seems to attract the drunken men and women looking to get over their Saturday hangovers. I never heard so many f bombs in such a short period of time...unless Richard Pryor counts.",

The other reason there's a star knocked off is the chaos of the place, there's no real guidance for where to wait to get your order.

The place was packed, which is why I am not a huge fan of this location. I'm going to guess that it's hard to find cheap eats on the Strip, so that's why the situation. There was just a huge line to order, a while to wait, a number system that didn't seem to be in any order so you really had to pay attention, and no where to sit. I will give them credit, that they did a pretty good job keeping things moving, all things considered. I just personally don't like being in big crowds and then eating standing up because that's my only option.  The burger was nice and juicy and lettuce and tomato provided the perfect contrast. The fries were great, described by my boyfriend as \"too salty\" but I say there's no such thing. Is it worth all the hassle of getting the food? Ehh I'm glad I tried it but brace yourself if you come here. I would be more than happy to visit another INO when I am somewhere else on the west coast, provided they are calmer.",

    "text": "In N Out Burger is one of those places, living in the Midwest, that everyone who has gone out west tells you to try asap. Well they aren't kidding. This place is a gem! The location I visited was off the strip near the Linq, and for a Friday night, it was super busy, but they keep that line a-movin'! Their menu is smaller than most fast food joints, but honestly, that makes it easier. No frills- hamburger, cheeseburger, fries and shakes. They DO have a secret menu that you can find online (I found out after leaving Vegas, boo!). The food is GOOD too, guys. Like the fries are perfect and the burger is so juicy. There's a little area that you can get all your condiments including peppers. It was kind of difficult to find a place to sit at that location, considering the time we went but they do have a lot of outside seating as well!",

    "text": "So back when I had much more hair and much less weight, I used to attend a hacker conference every summer in around late July - Black Hat/Defcon, it was called, and it used to take place at the now defunct Riviera hotel on the north side of the strip, close to the current location of Circus-circus.  One of the rites of passage for a journeymen \"hat\" is to make the trek up Las Vegas Blvd, walk about a click on Sahara Blvd and brave your way across Interstate 15 to hit In-n-out for a meal.  It's cheap, reliable food that is pretty much universally accepted by those who are not burdened by salad guilt, so to speak.  Of course, the last time I was at the Riviera for Defcon was during DC18 back in 2010.  For DC19 (2011) the venue was switched to the Rio, which it stuck to until it was moved onto the strip after DC22.  My last Defcon was 20, which was work financed with all sorts of employer sponsored hilarity involving roller derby girls, vodka cocktails at the Red Square in Mandalay Bay and an M249 SAW in a firing range (not necessarily in that order)  Fast forward today - different gig, and less happy reasons to be at the strip - job sent me here for ensuring smooth operations at trade shows (Freeman, the operator of the LVCC are the real one-arm bandits of Vegas), and I got put up in a hotel that I would prefer not to be in, but it's next to the monorail.  Of course, there's the small problem of finding a cheap place to eat close to the strip that won't go over the rather stingy per-diem allotment.  I mean, granted, if I have a rental car I can hit the $8 buffets at the Station House casinos off-strip, but I...don't.  So, I need a cheap, honest place on the strip, which by any sense of the concept is a contradiction.  Vegas is here to hustle, and the strip especially so.  Oh yeah, there is that bible passage quoting fast-food joint from SoCal on the other side of the Cajon pass...  So, In-n-out is rather famous if you orbit between the coasts.  It's supposed to be the west coast counterweight to Shake Shack, something that was known for its no-nonsense approach to the seemingly simple task of getting burgers, fries and shakes to the consumer without compromises to quality.   Unlike Ray Kroc's soul-less Scottish clown chain, In-n-Out is famous for not pushing for rapid expansion and \"consistency\" via shortcuts like using pre-cut frozen fries, frozen patties and soy based frozen beverages (you know, instead of real milkshakes).  They are also still an ostensibly family owned chain with its own idiosyncrasies (like biblical verse call-outs in the cups and hats).  In fact, it was the only burger chain welcomed to the Fisherman's wharf area in San Francisco due to its family owned nature and flexibility blending in with the local businesses.  The vision of a '64 Impala with the hydraulics deployed on an In-n-Out parking lot in Compton is as much a California thing as, say, the tricked out Integra Type-R in Daly City or a Tesla Model S at an In-n-Out in Malibu.  In-n-Out is a part of the California car culture transcending ethnic and class lines much like fuzzy dice or cruising down the Pacific Coast Highway.    So, what's so great about this particular location?  Well, it's cheap (compared to the rest of the offerings on the Strip), and unlike the other nonsense out there, it's a beacon of honest value.  If you blew a few hundred on Texas Hold-em and the casino won't cut you slack on the comps, you cash out your chips, walk down to the LinQ promenade and grab yourself a double double with animal fries and a Neapolitan shake.  It's a $12 outlay and it'll fix you right up.  If you enjoy it fresh (my recommendation is to eat right outside) it's a tasty repast that is invigorating.  If you are on the company tab, well, that and Capriotti's sub's represent good value for your limited meal dollars.",

    "text": "Ok, so the food would probably get three stars, but for my first time to this chain, and at a very busy Vegas location, it was a really good experience.   Burger was good, but definitely more salty than I'm used to - I think it must have been a fluke because surely their burgers aren't always this salty. I was hoping for leaf lettuce, but it was more like chunks of iceberg - just personal preference. The tomato was fresh and I liked the sauce, which is basically thousand island dressing. I ordered cheese fries but that was a mistake as I was expecting a cheese sauce but they a steam a slice of American cheese on top of the fries...had I known that I would  not have ordered cheese fries, haha, but again that's just personal preference.   It's quick and convenient, free refills on drinks, and for under $20 for two I was really pleased. Happy that I finally got to try it out.",

No but seriously ever since I had my first experience a month back I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. My first trip out west was in June and we didn't have time to fit In-N-Out into our schedule. When I found out I was going back in September I couldn't leave it out. I had to leave knowing I tried the famous In-N-Out.  I ordered just a single with fries because I didn't think I could eat a double double at the time. However, after one bite I wished I had ordered the double double. That burger was so juicy and the animal sauce was smothered all over the burger making it that much better! It didn't taste like a garbage burger. It tasted like a quality burger produced in a fast food setting.   We have something similar in Pittsburgh called Five Guys, but it doesn't give me the same feels. If I lived out west I would be frequently making trips here. The price is right and the burgers are tasty!",

You will probably have to wait a bit to get a table but turnover is high because people don't hang out there for too long.   The burgers will definitely hit the spot after a night out. I would recommend doing animal style on the fries and not the burger if you get the combo. However, the fries in general were really disappointing (friend described it best as cardboard). The animal style with cheese and onions made the fries more tolerable.",

The line wasn't too long and it moved quickly, with all enough employees manning the cash registers. We ordered some of the off-the-menu items (like fries well done, animal style fries-hold the grilled onions). Somehow our order got skipped over, along with about 10 others, but we got our food soon after we brought it to their attention. I thought maybe I had a bad experience when I had In-N-Out in LA, but nope.. everything just tasted overly salty to me. People ate and didn't linger, so by the time we got our food, there was an open table for us to plop down at. Since the turnover happens so quickly, the tables are not wiped down. All of the common areas (soda dispensers, condiments area) were cleaned and restocked often though. Overall, I'll eat here if someone requests it, but I wouldn't be the first to recommend it. Food isn't great, but the service sure is!",

Because it's cheap, good quality and of course the not so secret menu items. I tried the 2x2 animal style burger and animal style fries. Everything was good, don't get me wrong but I was way to hyped for this place. The food was good, and animal style adds good flavour but everything seemed cold and really greasy. I'm definitely going to try it again if I have the opportunity. But if you're visiting and don't have these around your home try it. It's cheap, decent burgers and filling.

I had been out west before, heard of In-n-Out before, and was always berated by people when they found out I had been in California/Vegas but hadn't gone to this burger place. I finally made my way back out to Vegas and tried it out with high hopes. Took me about 5-6 hours to realize that it was so average/below average that I couldn't even believe it. The patties are thin, they have no flavor, and the animal sauce is nowhere near as special as Mac SauceTM. I'm shocked that people think this place is good, almost to the point where I think I must be wrong. I'll try it again tmrw but I am sure that this place is missing many of the fundamentals of a good burger; needless to say their fries are also garbage. Johnny rockets is better than this place, and five guys wins without a conversation. So disappointed, in the restaurant, of course, but also in the percentage of humanity that advocates so heavily for a garbage burger chain. Good logo",

After eating an expensive dinner at Caesar's, I went to see the Beatle's Cirque du Soleil LOVE show.  By the time the show ended, I was kind of hungry again and went for a stroll on the way back to the hotel.    I saw a massive In-N-Out neon sign on the strip and made my way over.  Here is a tip, the restaurant is actually kind of hard to find.  Just keep walking towards the ferris wheel and it will be on your right hand side, if you're coming from the strip.  Anyways, I stopped in and they were doing brisk business even though it was 11pm.  So there was a bit of a wait but the cheeseburger I ordered was excellent, the bun was crispy and fresh, the fries were tasty and the lemonade hit the spot.  The In-N-Burger was way better value than anything served at the restaurant's on Caesar's properties.",

Location didn't disappoint!!!  The outside motif allowed for cool, fun photo op.  The inside is definitely not big enough to provide adequate seating for the business of this location.  We were lucky and just happened to grab a booth right before our food was ready.  However, while eating I just felt bad for all the people that didn't share our luck.  It was 115 outside so getting stuck eating out there could not have been enjoyable.  The staff was amazingly friendly.  They did a great job keeping tables cleaned and dining area presentable. The line to order was long but the crew moved it super fast.  They had at least four order takers on front cash. It was great.  As always, food was fresh and delicious.  Considering how busy they were, our order seemed to take no time to come out.  They have a merchandise window outside selling all kinds of shirt choices, souvenir pins, etc.  That was cool.  Do be advised, unfortunately prices are higher at this location.  That is the only reason for 4/5 stars.  I get it, companies want to take advantage of location/people but it still sucks.  I though In-N-Out would be different and stick with their prices and I was sadly disappointed.  It cost $35 for 3 drinks, 3 fries, 2 doubles, and 2 singles.  I was floored.  Due to that, unless you just want to check out the decor of the location I would eat any of the other dozen locations within miles.

No matter which location, I know that I will get the same great taste that I remember them to have. This location is really busy as it is in the Linq promenade so there is a lot of people nearby and stopping in here. There can be super long lines so just account for that especially when it's lunch or dinner time. The only thing you have to realize is that since it is in Las Vegas, there is a slight upcharge than what SoCal-ers may be used to.",

Only downside is that there are no bathrooms. You have to search endlessly in that area full of tourists, shops and restaurants just to find them. Very frustrating.",

And being one of the more affordable options on the strip, it's definitely busy at all times of day.   Seeing I didn't know when we would be making a trip to California again, it was a must to check out the new Promenade location and get my fix while I was in town. First visit I went for my standard Double Double Animal Protein burger and Animal Fries (well done!). Instead of braving the crowd, I took it back up to my room to enjoy in peace. Second visit, I just got a simple double double animal style (no fries); the lettuce wrapping takes a little longer at this location then I've experienced at other ones so I went without this time.   In-N-Out definitely ranks up there as a must stop whenever I'm in range for a visit.",

I will call the fries \"fry chips.\"  Most of the fries in the bowl were teeny, tiny pieces with about a dozen actual fries mixed in.  The cheese on top was kinda bland.  All this being said, this place was packed.  It takes some time to get your food so be prepared to wait.  Everyone seemed to have a good time and enjoy their meal.  When I think of Gormet Burgers I think of the restaurants at the Burg (St. Petersburg) or many of the fine restaurants in the Midwest.  I just did not find this burger up to that level.    The thing with this place is I was starving.  I had not eaten for 18 hours.  Anything should have tasted good.  I really wished I had gone somewhere else.  Maybe I had an off meal, but I won't be going back.",

So if you are vegan and have family or friends that want to go here, don't feel like you won't have any options because technically there are secret things you can order.   We were having dinner later so just decided to share some animal style fries (see picture to see what this means) and animal style cheeseburger. Basically animal style is when they put dressing on top. It's really tasty. Everything was good and tasted like it typically does, it had been many years since I had a burger from here but I would Return.   Also, I've never been to an In-N-out and it not be busy, so have some patience when you arrive. The staff are always super friendly though, at least in my opinion.",

    "text": "I've had plenty of In-N-Out and this location was by far one of the busiest which was expected because it's located on the LV strip and pretty much all In-N-Outs are busy. The most disappointing part of my experience here was the service: the cashier who took our order was plain rude and he really wanted to show how he didn't want to be there. This part of the In-N-Out experience was weird because I've never really had a bad service before even on their busiest hour at other locations.   Food was still good.  Restaurant was expectedly crowded.  I'll only go back here if I really crave it that I won't care about bad service.",

    "text": "Let's start with the pros of this particular In-N-Out location. First the location is nice, it's right off the strip in a colorful and busy area where there is plenty to keep you entertained while you eat. Second the service is extremely fast even though it was packed we didn't wait more than 10 minutes for our order. Third the food is worthy of an IG picture especially if you're from the East Coast-ish area like me where these don't exist. Annnd that's about all the pros I have. The 2 stars are for the customer service and location only. After all the excitement I felt when finally entering an In and Out it was quickly turned into disappointment once I bit into my Double-Double combo Animal Style. It was one of the most underwhelming experiences I've encountered while eating at a big name spot. It was just a bland patty and even blander fries even with the sauce and cheese. Needless to say I won't be back, but I'm still happy I was able to check In and Out off my Foodie Bucket List.",

They had a lot of employees working and because it is located on the strip it gets really packed. When I got there there were only 2 people in front of me but there were a lot of people waiting for their food. All the tables were full but my food was to go because we were going to eat in the room. It took us about 10 minutes to get our food which I was surprised, I thought it would take longer because there was a lot of people.  The employees were nice and they made sure they gave me enough ketchup. They also had enough chili peppers so you can grab.  Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and I will go back when I stay in Flamingo again because it is so close to it.",

Being my first ever trip to an In-N-Out location I needed to make the most out of it. The place itself was absolutely packed but they went through the line super fast, so kudos to the fast staff. I ended up giving the double double cheeseburger a try along with a side order of the French fries (I totally regret not trying a milkshake here as well). I've been waiting many years to bite into an In-N-Out burger and I didn't know if the hype was real or not, but boy oh boy, the hype is real. Don't get me wrong, this is not some revolutionary burger that's going to change the way you look at food, but it's the best possible version of a fast food cheeseburger I've ever had and for that, it gets a huge thumbs up from me. The French fries on the side were also really good and had some pretty great seasoning on them also, which made them the perfect companion for that double double.  Overall, my first trip to an In-N-Out was wonderful and they definitely lived up to the hype for me. Will I be hitting more of these up on future trips to the west coast? 100% yes!",

The fries were ok, nothing special in my opinion. It was really hard to find a seat but we got to eventually. The place was super hot, it didn't really seem like they had AC which was a bummer, would've enjoyed the burger more that way but of course there was just way too many people.

I've dropped by The LINQ's location several times and did so again this past CES 2019.   My standard order during lunch is the double-double, fries, and a coke (burger and fries animal style). As always, there is a line and a 15 minute wait (but I commend the managers and staff for being as efficient as they are). My meal was served quickly and I ended up eating in the outdoor pavilion area. The burger is always solid - thin, crispy patties with cheese, animal style toppings (chopped grilled onions, thousand island sauce) but the fries, when prepared animal style, require a fork and knife (delicious but very messy).   Overall, a great product, solid pricing, prepared with focus and limited deviation from best practices. It's what makes In-N-Out a success!",

We ordered, then waited about 5-10 minutes for our food to be done. It was located a short walk from the high roller and right next door to sprinkles cupcakes.   Now, the food. Goodness, it was fantastic. The menu is tiny, but they do what they have well. We got cheeseburgers and animal fries and couldn't get enough. That sauce is something else! The only thing we didn't love was the chocolate shake... just because we've had some amazing shakes. This one was ok, but not amazing.   So, that's it. We are hooked.

I'm sure every Californian will rub in your face that In-N-Out is the best fast food joint out there while all Non-Californians uselessly argue against it. Forget about it, if you're near California, at In-N-Out, and aren't from California, you're gonna lose the argument. Take your opinion elsewhere.  Since I live in Miami, my opportunity to frequent In-N-Out is few and far between - relegated to the times when I am at West coast attending conference. So we tried the double double with animal fries. You won't never go wrong with this. The best part of In-N-Out burgers is that they are not greasy. You don't feel gross after eating one burger. Two, maybe... I'm a huge fan of their French fries. They just taste more potatoey and fresh to me. If you get it animal style, make sure you have mints because your breath will smell like onions! Ah yes, I need not mention the \"secret\" menu cause everyone and their mother better damm well know it by heart by now.  This is not your usual fast-food restaurant.  This is In-n-Out, and it's earned its reputation. It's undoubtedly very busy when we were there. But the lines went by very quickly and we managed to get our orders in within 10 minutes. And for some reason, despite the craziness, we were still able to find a seat to sit inside. This particular location has great service. The staff are quick, yet are always very personable when you come. I also appreciate how informed they are and not totally lost like other fast food employees. I love their outfits as well!   If you want a quick inexpensive meal, In-n-Out is your fallback option.  You know what you'll get:  high-quality burgers and fries for under 10 bucks.",

People on the east coast often compare it to Shake Shack, but it's far from that. The restaurant was very crowded, the air smelt like fast food, and the tables were all dirty.   I decided to order the animal style fries, which I was very disappointed by. The fries were didn't have much flavor, and the ketchup mayo sauce tasted artificial. I would go back to try the burger and shakes as the prices were very fair, but I wouldn't go back for the fries.",

Great addition to the linq promenade, with all the other bars and businesses around already.  Anyway, this place is busssssyyy (which in n out isn't though). The flow is quick and efficient, probably had 15 people in line but it cleared out within a few minutes. I got so excited for my cheap in n out burger I forgot to ask for animal style on my burger... *face palm*. Ended up asking for the spread and adding it to my burger which will have to do. This is probably the \"best\" meal to get on the strip if you want something cheap and affordable. I was eating at other restaurants costing me more than $40 each time so this was a major plus in my book.  I love the water fountain area in front of in n out to just sit and enjoy your burger, and just the atmosphere of it all. Perfect November weather for Vegas and perfect view of the high roller and the new zipline they just added!",

At this particular location the lines get pretty long and finding a table is a bit of a challenge. The only upside is that bcz your order takes so long you're able to nonchalantly stalk and grab a table before your order number is called.   We tried burgers and fries plain and animal style and it was great going down but this grease sensitive tummy sent it right back up within the hour. The highlight for me was the milk shake.   Would I go again?  Nah.  But i'm happy to say I had the experience.",

    "text": "I am a HUGE fan of In-N-Out, but before coming to this location, I had only dined at the L.A. locations.  So when I was planning my very first trip to Las Vegas, this In-N-Out on the Strip was added to my to-do list.  And the hubs and I weren't going to eat there just once... we planned to go twice.  And we did!  Both times, everything was just as delicious as I remembered from L.A.  Our first visit was around 11:30 am on a Wednesday, and while the restaurant was busy, the line wasn't long yet.  Every table was occupied, but after ordering and paying, the hubs and I only had to stand around for a few minutes until a table opened up.  Most customers know not to linger after finishing their food since In-N-Outs, in general, tend to get busy and full.  As indicated by the restaurant's name, it is not the place to just sit and hang out.  If you are dining in, you don't have to \"rush,\" but please be considerate of those who are waiting for a table.  During our second visit, we got into a long line around 2 pm on a Saturday.  However, the line moved pretty quickly.  While my husband ordered and paid, I went to the dining room and waited patiently by a table that looked like they were finishing up soon.  I was delighted when the two ladies at the table asked if I'd like to use their table when they were done.  Score!  What I've had at this location:  * Cheeseburger ($3.25) - If you're not super hungry, the single patty cheeseburger is a good amount of food.  I always get my burgers with NO onions.  This simple, classic cheeseburger is seasoned perfectly with the right amount of \"spread\" (basically Thousand Island-style sauce) along with lettuce and tomato.  Every ingredient tasted fresh and delicious. * Double-Double ($4.50) - Pretty much ditto what I said about the regular (single patty) cheeseburger, but add an extra patty and an extra slice of cheese for more food and flavor! * Fries ($2.10) - The flavor of their not-so-greasy fries actually reminds me of potato chips!  They're somewhat light and even though they're not the best fast food fries (in my humble opinion), I still think they're tasty and pair perfectly with the amazing burgers!  I don't bother with animal-style (\"secret menu\" item... ask them), protein-style (lettuce instead of buns), or any of the milkshakes.  I've always enjoyed the simple, classic items as they have consistently been good.  Overall, this In-N-Out Burger on the Las Vegas strip gets 5 stars!  Thanks to the friendly and efficient employees, convenient location on the Strip (The LINQ Promenade), and of course - the BEST fast food burgers, the hubs and I thoroughly enjoyed both of our visits to this location.  We'll definitely return whenever we visit Vegas!",

Finding a seat was another matter but by divide and conquer we managed to solve that one. There's seating available outside in the patio too but it's pretty darn hot outside.  When the number was called, we pounced and got to the burgers and fries ASAP. The French fries were the way I like them -- thin sticks of goodness as salty as the Dead Sea. Perfect. The burger was pretty good but a little small.",

Could not give it 5 stars only because they do not offer any other kinds of cheese for the burgers. I love Cheddar cheese and it would of made there burgers that much better. Culver's is still #1 in my book because you can get different cheese on your burger, like Cheddar.",

I usually get a single with cheese and spread only.  When hungrier I get the double double.   This location is located on The Strip in the Linq Promenade. My wife and I got there right when they opened at 10:30am on a Friday, so it was not super busy. But it did not take long for the line to grow. I can only imagine how slammed this location gets.

Our favorite place to get burgers, In-N-Out serves up their regular items with a slight upcharge, but not by much.  It's crowded, yes, and you may not be able to find a seat at prime hours (like on New Year's Day), but there is plenty of seating next to the fountain outside. My regular order is the #3:  hamburger with grilled onions, fries well-done, and a root beer.  It's just as good here as it is at other locations so if you want your fix, just be a little patient for your order and you'll be enjoying the best of the West in no time.",

    "text": "Finally got to try In-N-Out Burger!  I've seen people post pictures of their burgers and \"Animal Style\" fries, I just had to try it for myself.  My friend and I came here around 5:00pm.  The lines weren't too long and go by quickly, the place was packed with people waiting for their food and seats and tables were filled.  I ordered the Cheeseburger Combo (protein style), which came with fries and a medium drink.  I ordered my fries \"Animal Style,\" which is fries topped with melted cheese, sauteed chopped onions and Thousand Island Dressing.  The burger was delicious; the protein/bunless version makes it feel light and the Thousand Island Dressing adds some sweetness but complements the burger really well.  The \"Animal Style\" fries was just okay for me.  I would order the fries as is.  It's quite messy, so my friend and I asked for utensils.  Customer service was friendly and quick, despite the busyness.  I'll come back here if I'm ever craving for a burger. I have yet to try their milkshakes!  Some tips and notes:  - They do protein/bunless burgers; it's not on the menu, you just have to ask - \"Animal Style\" fries is on their secret menu, as my friend has told me; mention it to the cashier and they'll know what you're talking about - They do not have utensils in the back with the condiments and napkins; you will need to ask - Eating the \"Animal Style\" fries can be messy, make sure to ask for utensils!",

One of the very best fast food burgers. Was it the best? No! My vote still goes to Shake Shack.  P.S. One noted deficiency; although there is a very nice and simple menu, all the options for the fries were not listed. I had to ask if it was possible if to get cheese on my fires. After I ordered I learned that there is also the \"Animal\" option for the fries, which appeared to be cheese, chili, and some kind of special sauce.

We noticed that In-N-Out was close by so decided to give it a try.  My wife spoke highly about eating at different In-N -Out Burger joints in the past.   They have a very simple menu with only a few options.  It was very busy but they definitely live up to their name.  The food arrived quickly and was what I expected.  I had the Double Cheeseburger with Fries.  It was a good burger, but if you are expecting something special, you might go somewhere else.  The Fries were kind of disappointing to me.  It was like they weren't deep fried or something.  They were just dry and not as good as other fast food options in my opinion.    Overall it was a good, reasonably priced, quick place to grab some food after a night of drinking.  They must be doing something right for how long the chain has been in business with such a simple business plan.  It met my expectations and we will go there again if it is up to my wife.  She really likes it!",

It was time for me to finally determine if it was all hype or reality at In & Out.  After a modest wait (15 mins?) my double-double \"animal style\" was ready and was adequate in taste, but far from spectacular. Fries were a disappointment- very lukewarm temperature, and sort of bland tasting. Went back up to the counter and asked for some fresh and hotter ones, and was served the same poor tasting and equally lukewarmy crap.   In this price range, I'd probably recommend Shake Shack or Fuku Burger - both just a short walk away. And for a tiny bit more, Twin Peaks would be a better choice too.",

They have a rope at the front door with two door man making sure that the place didn't get over run with customers. We were let in right away.  It was a small shop with not very many indoor seating available. I was lucky to find a table. They have a cleaning crew that does nothing but clean the floors, counters and tables. The turnover is huge. The cleaner was friendly, outgoing and a joy to converse with. It make the experience pleasant. The food is a bit pricey but everyone seems to love it.

It was always a hassle in the past to get to one in Vegas but now it's as easy as walking down the strip.  I dinned here 3 times during my long weekend and it was packed each time. The good news is that the ordering line moves fast and waiting for your food is easy as you can watch the food from other orders pass you by and anticipate the greatness about to come your way.  Of course their food was wonderful as usual. A Double Double with fries and a vanilla shake. Why order anything else?? There is the usual seating and some outdoor seating as well. It is a bit limited during peak times but there are plenty of bench style seats just outside within the LINQ area.   During each of my visits, I was approached by an employee asking me how \"everything was\" as least once. On my third visit, I was approached 3 times and asked how my meal was and if I needed anything. This is unheard of in the fast food industry and I am very impressed. Did I also mention everything is reasonably priced? Especially for Vegas.  If you are on the strip and in the market for great fast food, do yourself a favor and experience In-N-Out Burger. I can only dream of them opening in NYC!!!!",

I really wanted something good and cheap as I knew that it was going to be a long time before dinner. It was well worth the hour wait from in line, paying and getting the food. Of course with any other location finding a seat is a challenge. I would have more luck winning money at the slots than actually finding a seat the first time. Eventually we realized that this wasn't anti social Vancouver and that most people given the seating circumstance would be happy to share a seat with us. We found a seat with this lovely couple. Again seat sharing isn't a thing in Vancouver so we were shocked as someone actually welcomed us to their seat. I didn't do animal style this time. I just got two basic burgers and fries to share. I am happy to report that the taste is just like the location in LA. I ate that burger slowly with my eyes closed. I didn't even talk to my best friend. I just wanted the moment to myself. I picked up a pair of In and Out Milk Shake socks on the way out since I collect cool socks.",

The restaurant was busy with a lot of people working but also seemed disorganized compared to my experience at similar in-n-out's in California. Double/Double animals style was tasty. My friend got his fries extra crispy which made them like potato chips.",

Word of advice, just don't get them.  This chain needs to do something to make their fries better, such as fresh cut like the 5 Guys chain does.",

Second, we ordered our food and waited 20 minutes as they called up to 15 numbers more than our number. This wouldn't have been that big of a deal had we not had to ask about where our food was. We waited an additional 5 minutes before we got our food and got no apology. LAST, someone stole my drink as we were waiting (which had my receipt on it). I felt at first that someone must have stolen our food. But the person handing out the food was checking receipts. So this is In N Out's staff's fault. I'll never come here again.",

Not gonna lie, I was tempted to walk out but there were so many hard working staff and numbers were being called so quickly, I soon realized that the wait would be worth it. We ended up waiting only about 10 mins and we got our food. We ended up eating outside by the stage because there was not really any space inside to eat. I only gave it 4 stars because it was a bit too much to go through but all things considered it was a good experience.",

    "text": "Las Vegas Strip has a tasty IN and OUT Burger, when Colorado doesn't even have one. I have friends visiting from Colorado. When they fly into Las Vegas, the first place they want to go is In and Out. Now I take them to the Linq so that they can have the Las Vegas adventure with their burger. I used to take them to UNLV near the airport, but the Las Vegas Strip is a great experience for tourists. If your visitors travel all the way to Nevada, if they crave the taste of an In and Out Burger with hot peppers if you like them, take trip for the burgers to the Strip across from Caesar's Palace and next to the Flamingo Hotel Resort for an In and Out Burger. The place also has outside dining so that you can sit and watch tourists walk by. Remember in this hot weather, In and Out also has ice cream shakes with chocolate and strawberries. We went across the way to a chocolate store for desert after our burgers. There is also a place that makes custom made cup cakes directly next door, so when you finish your main course, you have a variety of great shopping, more restaurants, and of course, the LInq ferris wheel. Enjoy summer 2017 with fries on the Las Vegas Strip people watching.",

We thank him/her for their sacrifice.  Staff was very friendly. Shout out to Eric in particular. They recognize cute rompers. They recognize Swedish Delight. They recognize my need to hydrate without #Fiji water.Real recognize real.  Five Guys has better burgers and fries...but the price is pretty good. It's like the Calvin Harris of fast food. Good for fast food but still trash.  Bring your date if they like wearing paper hats and are afraid of Burger King.  7.5 would recommend",

The double, double wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either. The cheese fries looked AMAZING, so I decided to try them. They were just fries with a slice of American cheese melted atop; they sucked.   Service was great considering the amount of people that were waiting to eat. We received our food relatively fast and the order was 100 percent accurate. I would not go back, but I'm glad I got to try it.   Side note: my husband thought the burger was FANTASTIC, but he and I are on opposite ends of the burger spectrum",

They're located by some big bars so it'd be great to see them open longer because I know they'd get business. Order your burgers animal style to get some pickles and chopped, grilled onions!",

I have been dying to try IN-N-OUT since the celebrities I follow on social media are always getting it. So I was excited to know that I had one right next to my hotel on the strip. When I first arrived to Las Vegas I checked in to my hotel and went straight to eat. The lines were really long but they move extremely fast and make sure you pay attention to your meal number as they don't go in order.  I got the cheeseburger meal with a vanilla shake and OMG it was to die for! I love how crispy the bun was from them toasting it and how packed my burger came but not sloppy at all. I hate have to bite into a burger and all the ingredients are falling out because it was overstuffed and everything becomes a mess. With this burger it was no problem. The milkshake was thick and creamy. The animal fries were fantastic!!!  I went about 5 times during my 3 day stay because it was the only fairly priced meal on the strip that was worth what you pay! Only problem I had was the attack of pigeons in the outside seating area that never left your side lol. But I demolished my food quickly so it wasn't a bother.  Thank you IN-N-OUT for your great food and amazing service!!!!!",

There were zero tables to sit at inside or outside, so we opted for the the fountain. It was a warm day and the mist from the fountain felt nice anyway. But, be aware, seating can be difficult!   As far as the food goes - it was wonderful! Between the three of us, we had two double-doubles - one of them animal style, one single cheese burger, three orders of fries - two of them animal style. We were not able to even come close to finishing everything. Portions are very generous! I recommend sharing fries if you're not all that hungry!   And if you're not familiar with animal style, just try it! You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Eating at in n out is a must do every time we happen to be on the west coast. I sent my friends snapchats of my food and they were jealous. I think this is my favorite fast food burger ever. My husband and I both get the double doubles and fries. The burgers are fresh and I love the toasted roll. The fries are crispy and fresh as well. I think I got the burger animal style when we went years ago, but I don't think we remembered to order it that way this time. I wish they would put it as an option on the menu, rather than \"secret\". Now I need to come back to the West Coast soon to try it again.   I really liked this location as well. It was a short walk from our hotel and the Linc is a cool hangout place with a lot of different restaurants and bars. We were planning on coming back a second time later in the week but unfortunately we didn't make it back.  They need to open up some locations around Philly! Or at least somewhere along the East Coast!",

I had tried them years ago in LA, but had forgotten how I liked them, so got the opportunity to try them again while in Vegas for a conference with coworkers.   It gets pretty busy but once we got our food I was excited to dig in. I got a cheeseburger animal style and cheese fries. I'm a big lover of fries and love some good cheese fries. Unfortunately these disappointed. I thought the cheese would be more of a liquid texture, like good cheese fries should be. Instead the cheese was melted hard on top of he fries so everything was stuck together and impossible to spread around. Even alone the fries just weren't good, which really sucks. The burger however was better but still nothing to write a great review about.   I really wanted to love everything but it just didn't do it for me. Maybe I should have went to Shake Shack instead...",

    "text": "YOU GUYS! We need one of these in Minnesota! Yes we do!   My 7th time in Vegas and I like the LINQ promenade, lots to do and plenty to see. It was my first time going to an In-N-Out Burger and I was so impressed with everything that it has now moved Shake Shack down to number 3 instead of number 2. In-N-Out is now my number 2 burger spot in the US.  Ok - we actually managed to find seating inside! Mainly to avoid the pigeons. Just kidding! It's hot in Vegas and air conditioning is good. I snagged us a table after ordering and husband stood in the waiting line to fetch the food once our number was called. Once our number was finally called it was like heaven was speaking to me....\"FOOOD...go fetch your fooood, it's hot and fresh waiting for yooouu\" - well not really but almost! We ordered our Double Doubles \"animal style\" and our fries \"animal style\" too! Found out that meant the Burger patties are fried in a mustard sauce and Thousand Island dressing and fried onions are added on afterwards. Woah. I've never had an appreciation for Thousand Island quite like this before! The fries arrive the same way AND with melted cheese on them. Double woah. Where the heck have you been all my life In-N-Out? Oh, on the West Coast.   I thought it was better than Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr. and creeping on up there on my burger list it was, fighting the others down, down, down. Even the hats were so cool we asked for one, and they gave us a few as we left. Please for to open up in Midwest. Pretty please.",

I'd have to say, this is the first time I've been to Vegas that I didn't eat at a buffet.  But In-N-Out is always a good choice!  Finding this little haven is a bit of a challenge.  I had never been down this street, and there were a lot of shops and other restaurants, so it was more like an outdoor mini-mall and it was right next to the Eye in the Sky.  Yes, there is always a wait, and the area is a little cramped.  But this double burger and animal fries really hit the spot!  Considering I had a single $8 shrimp cocktail earlier....LOLLLL!",

Objectively, I think Shake Shack and Five Guys serve a much more delicious burger, but for the price, you really can't beat In-N-Out. Eating In-N-Out for three days also did not make me feel disgustingly greasy or anything, which I feel like after I'm done eating at Five Guys. I do have to say that their fries, even animal style, lack a lot of texture and flavor - stick to the burgers.",

This location was close to where we were staying on the strip so we decided to give it a try. So much better than its Texas counterpart. The burger tasted fresh, the veggies were crisp and the bun was toasted to perfection. A really good burger. The fries still sucked, but at least they weren't burnt! We ate here a couple more times during our stay, and while the subsequent visits were not as good as our first, the food was still palatable. Maybe I'll check out a TX location again. Maybe?",

    "text": "I have to preface this review by saying that I am a born and bred Californian that has loved In-N-Out. However, location's customer service needs substantial improvement.   I came in on 11/24 at around 10:40pm with my 12 year old niece, my husband and my two brothers  -in-law. My 12 year old niece ordered two animal style double doubles with chili's and an animal style cheeseburger. Note: she'd ordered the double doubles for her grandparents and planned to drop them at their hotel room.  When her order was ready, we grabbed the bags and walked away. As we were moving her burger to its own bag (because the double doubles were going to get dropped off), we noticed that her cheeseburger wasn't animal style as she'd ordered it, so we walked back in to tell the gentleman who'd provided us with her food. Pro tip: animal style includes grilled onions.   I'd told him that my niece's cheeseburger had fresh onions on it when it was supposed to be animal style. He immediately tried to rebut and tell me that the burger that had fresh onions on it was actually one of the double doubles and that all was okay with the order. Well, that would make sense if we hadn't asked for both of the double doubles to be animal style. I'd mentioned that to him too. Note: the burger with the fresh onions on it clearly only had one patty.   At that point, he'd asked us to see her receipt in a noticeably frustrated and skeptical way. That same employee had already taken the receipt away from my niece when she'd initially picked her order up. I'd made sure to verbally let him know our order number and that he'd already taken the receipt so we had nothing else to provide him with as proof of order.  Finally, he said, \"okay, we'll do you want a new burger or can we just put the grilled onions on this one?\"   At that point, my 12 year old niece just wanted to eat, so she'd asked them to put the grilled onions on the same sandwich because she didn't want to wait any longer.   I'd been to so many In-N-Out locations before and I've never ran into a situation like this, where  an employee had went through so much trouble to NOT provide good customer service. He wasted more time questioning us and pushing back than fixing the order.  Do better next time.",

This caused me no small amount of discontent on the homefront. And I am sad to report that it was not remotely worth it. To me, the best thing In-N-Out Burger has going for it is an extremely affordable price point. But that's it. The fries are uninspired and overcooked. The burgers are dry and relatively flavorless. The shake was good, but I've never had a bad milkshake so that's not impressive. The location is also quite bustling, so be prepared to wait in a line for this thoroughly unimpressive burger. I anticipate that some readers of this review will be very angry by what I have written. I stand by my opinion. I have now visited this location twice and was equally unimpressed on both times. In-N-Out Burger stinks. Fight me!  Please don't actually fight me. I am very fragile. But I still don't like this restaurant.",

I don't make it out to the west coast nearly as much as I'd like to, but when I do, I always make it a point to head to In-N-Out.   And this last time in Vegas was no different. I snuck out in the middle of a work meeting to get here; consequences be damned. Some things are just more important.   It's a mall restaurant, not a stand alone place but the experience on the inside was the same.  My double double was perfect, my fries were perfect and even though I don't drink soda, my soda was perfect.   I got my fix and left happy. So if you need to escape  a boring work meeting or you just want a great burger, head straight here.",

I can see why people love it, the rarity, the freshness. I think people must love the nostalgia and the no frills version of the American classic cheeseburger. So overall solid burger and fries. I did try the animal style fries which I was not a fan of. I don't know, maybe I'm a spoiled east coaster but while good, I'm still not thinking this tops Five Guys! Beware this location is very busy as it's part of the strip, so be prepared for a long line (seems to move quickly though) and to have to scout for seating.",

I ordered up a double double \"Protein Style\" - this is a secret menu item that replaces the bun with a lettuce bun for low carb eaters. The burger took a little longer than the tradition bun burger, but it was wrapped in iceburg lettuce really well. It did not fall apart as I was eating it and it was able to hold all of my toppings in. The ingredients tasted very fresh and the lettuce had a nice snap to it. The burgers were seasoned nicely and had some heft to them. The burgers didn't seem to shrivel to nothing like some other fast food places.   They have a little shop attached to the restaurant where you can order up all your in-n-out gear with free shipping. Lots of their customers are from out of town, so this is a great option to have all of your gear mailed directly home for you so you don't have to worry about getting anything home on the plane.",

We stayed at the Flamingo hotel and this location was practically right outside the doors. I guess it was new since my Uber driver told me I'd have to leave the strip to find one.  We went later in the evening one night. The line was pretty long, but it moved extremely fast. From the time I ordered, received my food, and finished eating, they had already served over 100 other patrons. That is some great service.   Ordered a double double and a side of fries. Everything exceeded expectations that I had in my head.   My only problem is that now that I have finally had In-N-Out, is that I won't be able to have it again for a long while. :(",

That's when I fell in love with In-N -Out.  The burgers and nice and juicy the fries are crisp, but them shakes HIT different. It's  like they take strawberries picked from the freshest fields and mix them with sugar and spice and all things super nice.....LoL, they really hit different.

The lineup went fast and you ordered quickly but that waiting for the food was just insane! Clearly this was a popular joint, I remember having it when I went to Cali. But it never looked like this.  The food is good- the burgers are juicy and taste but the fries are the star for me. I like that you can add some zing and scoop some peppers on the side.   The loss of the star is the waiting for seating. It was like being apart of a pack of hyenas waiting for the next seat available. Once you make that eye contact with someone, you know they are getting up and it's like 3-4 people running for the same table. They need more seats or something up in there!",

Fast and friendly service- you really can get \"in and out\"! What's not to love about this place! Best bang for your buck and hands down best fast food!",

Found seating quick and our food for the four of us came out in just 7 minutes .... any staff walking by us would ask if we needed anything or even at the end came and took our trash... also I have to add everyone working seemed to work together as a team and would help each other out ... the floor was a little dirty in one spot and I saw a worker walk by and say \"oh we gotta clean this!\" And then came back with a mop and someone to dry it up as she cleaned the floor ... great experience and will be coming back.",

I got the double patty w/ cheese protein style and fries. The food was good, my burger wasn't all soggy and dripping with juices like other places. The fries were fresh and crispy.  I docked a star because it's like a massacre in there. The restaurant is so small and there was A CRAP TON OF PPL. You literally have to stalk for a table! It's so awkward standing next to someone half way finishing their meal so that you can get their table when they're done. The wait for food wasn't too bad considering how many people were squished inside this tiny restaurant. A lot of others had to get outdoor seating and even took over Sprinkles' outdoor tables.",

The secret menu fries which they call Animal fries: 1/5 - toppings consisted of cooked onions, cheese and a sauce that tastes like the thousand island salad dressing).

I would suggest going animal style but only on the fries because they were quite dry without the sauces. The quality of the burger is evident with your first bite.  As far as price goes you really cant beat it compared to other food you will find in Vegas, butttt you better be ready for a wait.  We went for lunch and it was packed out.  We ended up waiting for the 25 minutes in line and then having to sit outside the restaurant near the fountain.",

The line to order was short, but the line to wait for food was all huddling around the drink area. Luckily for me, I only ordered a chocolate shake and animal style fries. Prices are pretty cheap until you want to make it animal style.  Chocolate Shake - $2.50 It was too thick to even drink out of the straw.   French Fries - $2.10 + $2.00 (Animal Style) - I guess I'm just not that big of a fan of In -n-Out like others. It was okay.   I think I prefer Shake Shack over this place. I guess I come hoping it'll be better then the last time.",

Most quick burger places have the soggy tomato problem, not here.  Employees wear these oversized hats, straight out of Pizza Planet from Toy Story. Speed is a priority, but always have my order right. Food comes in little red lunch trays. Burgers are served with the wrapper support, facing upward. Food presentation checks every box.   This location is newer, and probably the largest In N' Out that I've seen. They're running through people here. Ticket numbers cycle 1-100 throughout the day. I was order #17. By the time I finished my meal, they were on order #94. Talk about speedy gonzalez! Mind..blown !   ANIMAL style is my favorite aspect of In N' Out, which is the Golden Goose of the franchise. Although not featured on the menu, Animal orders smear a blend of sauteed onions and thousand island sauce, to my knowledge. Anything you order can be served animal style.   Milkshakes are mediocre average, but they also don't claim them as a focal point. --PASS--  ***Affordable, quick, delicious. You really do come in, then out. HUGE IMPACT. My only complaint is the lack of locations around the country. Consistent end product, start to finish***",

It was super busy when we went (not surprising) but the employees were all really friendly and nice. I was expecting it to take long because it's pretty typical that it's a long wait. Since I made two different orders, I got them at different times. When I told them which order I was waiting for they reassured me that it is on its way. They kept checking in on me and letting me know where they were at with my second order. I really appreciated how nice they were, it made waiting less annoying haha.   As for the food... one of my favorite burgers ever. I got the double double with onions. I'm not a big fan of the fries but I got well done fries. Finished it all and I was happy! Definitely coming back every time I visit Las Vegas!",

Well, it was around 9pm and I just happened to be walking nearby In-N-Out at the LINQ and so you know, when you crave something you love, you gotta have it!  I just ordered my usual two cheeseburgers Animal style without lettuce and tomatoes (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2w4yKZl&s=eecdc2e1bc54d03761dcae1958b632a35ece1a5eab9590a5a71b16782cedd57c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2w4yKZl</a>).  Just the way I like it and totally hit the spot for me.  I didn't order any fries only because I was craving the burgers at the time.  This location is pretty similar to the San Francisco location at Fisherman's Wharf.  There's no drive-thru, but a ton of tables both inside and outside.  Plus the prices are inflated since it's literally on the Strip, but still cheaper than Shake Shack, and even White Castle.    Overall, this In-N-Out location is a very welcome addition to the Strip and is another great late night burger option if you're in that area.",

I really like what they did with this previously unused area. It's quite the attraction now with unique shops, the ferris wheel, and of course In-N-Out! I always get the double hamburger because my sensitive palate can't take any processed 'American' cheese. It's reminds me of plastic and the consistency is quite revolting. I've heard of the 'animal style' but I prefer my onions sauted. I do like their shoestring fries and the unlimited spicy peppers that you can help yourself to.  This location is small but people don't stay long. You could even say they move In-N-Out quickly... I always like to look at the merchandise but I have a hard time buying virtually useless things at those prices. I'd much rather lose it at the roulette table or put it toward 1/10th of a show ticket.  I'll be back for more burgers and fries!",

So, I thought d take a stroll through the Linq Promenade to find a place to eat lunch. I was thinking about going to the Tilted Kilt, but then just past it I saw it.... the wonderful, wonderful In-N-Out Burger. There it was in all its glory calling my name. Yes that's where I'd get lunch of course.   I go in and the place was jam packed. But no worries this place is as efficient as a fast food restaurant can get. They had a million people working there. The staff was great!!! Friendly, knowledgeable and nice looking. The store was crowded but it was clean. It was like a Rolls Royce, a fine running smooth machine. The orders were coming out so fast the long line wasn't a problem. I got my food within a couple of minutes.   Outside it was 115 degrees so every table in the place was taken, nobody wanted to eat outside. I stood to eat until a seat came open.   The double bacon cheeseburger was magnificent. Hot, juicy and full of flavor, the bun soft and fresh and the bacon? Well it's bacon so it's good all bacon is good. The fries were pretty damn yummy too. This was an excellent meal. Not quite as good as Gordon Ramsey's Steakhouse at the Paris or Hugo's Cellar at the Four Queens but it was fantastic.   I left feeling full and happy. I wish In-N- Out Burger would move into the Washington DC area.",

I haven't had one of these in years and it just doesn't disappoint.  $4 for a great burger, loaded with fresh lettuce, a hefty slice of tomato, cheese, generous pickles, and most importantly, that rock on animal sauce.  If that doesn't get you hooked, how about the whole potatoes being cut into fries right in front of you.  Even better, get them loaded with the animal sauce and it's like nothing else you've ever had on top of fries.  There is not a better burger for $4 anywhere.  Only one complaint, when is In-N-Out going to open up on the East Coast?",

This location is located in the Promenade, and you can't miss it! We went on a Saturday night, and while there was a line, it moved quickly.   My husband and I each had a number one combo, but \"Animal Style\" burgers and fries. The burger was delicious, and the freshness of the lettuce and tomato really gives a nice taste to the burger. The Animal Style fries are hearty, so be prepared. The cheese, onions, and spread really give a nice taste to the fries, but it is filling!   We definitely will be back, and I'm glad it was worth the hype!",

He even brought us extra napkins.  Excellent service!",

I rate In N Out as the best fast food burger chain in the country.  As you might expect given its location, the atmosphere is chaotic. I've never been to a location that wasn't very busy, but even by these standards, this place is booming. As in, I think they were serving orders in the 30s and my order was 84.  You might think that would entail a crazy wait but it did not. Within fifteen minutes I had my food in my hands.  Now, finding a seat is a bit of a different story--i should have grabbed one once I poured my water. Instead I dutifully waited until I had the order, and then looked for a seat. And looked. And looked. I had some fries while I waited. Finally a seat opened up, yay!  This is wedged into an area that has no cars, only foot traffic. So if you go by Uber just have them drop you off at the Flamingo.",

We stopped in and they had a line out the door, but got everyone through in a short span of time. The team was very quick with orders and efficient.   I got the double double which is standard with fries and a drink.  Burger came out on about 10 minutes and was delicious and greasy as is what you would expect going to In-N-Out. For some reason, I had a very thick slice of tomato in mine.  I enjoy tomatoes, so its no big deal.    Inside was a little packed and had to share tables with strangers, and it was a little dirtier than I would've liked, but that's no fault of the staffs because the restaurant always seems to be absolutely packed.   Either way, you know what you want when you come here, a good fast food burger, and that's exactly what you'll get.    I highly recommend stopping by here if you get the chance.",

Maybe I've grown out of fast food but I didn't love the quality of the food.

So there were a few sprinkled thru out the city and we chose one on the strip. Upon arrival obviously this place was no secret, and a popular place. The menu is pretty basic and it's easy to make up your mind as you either get a single or a double. Combo meals are optional.  I opted for a dbl and both my son and wife both had singles, we all had fries which are the skinny type almost like string fries if you will. The burgers were decent but honestly I could have probably eaten 2 of the doubles. I am a bigger fella but honestly comparison wise I do get full on Wendy's/McDonald's double burgers. But dont get me wrong they were a different animal on the fast food chain and we did ask the local Lyft drivers thier opinions and one said definitely once a week, and the other at once a month so its definitely on everyone's radar. If your by one give it a shot, and honestly if we had them here in Denver we would probably have this in our rotation of quick bite spots.  And yes, we did enjoy our meals.",

The person taking orders was very friendly and they did have a couple of kids continuously cleaning the floor and clearing tables.  However, the food was sub par.  It took a while for the order (yes, i know they were busy) but you would think that with that many orders they would be constantly  making fresh fries, but 'no'.  And worst, not only were the fries not hot but they were like cardboard lacking flavor and dry not moist on the inside.  The best part of the burger was the lettuce and tomato.  The meat was tasteless.  Not sure it is worthwhile to go there just to say you have been to an I&O burger",

Coming from the Midwest where In-N-Out Burgers don't exist, we especially appreciated that we can now eat here during our trips to Vegas without having to leave the strip. We came here on a Wednesday shortly after they opened for lunch and it was packed. The line to order went out the door, so we had to wait quite a while to order, and then a bit to get our food. The restaurant isn't very big (was hoping for more seating), but it was clean, and there were a few tables outside. When we finally got our food, it was delicious. It's so great to have an affordable yet good place to have lunch on the strip-something we've been wanting for a long time. We'll definitely be back!",

We do not have these in Ohio! The menu is very small- the focus is the burger. First off, this is Vegas, so there was an annoying guy in front of me yelling, picking up pennies, calling the cashiers \"cute and sexy\", and flamboyantly twirling around the restaurant. Not In-N-Out's fault but oh boy it was about to ruin my experience. Anyway, the service line was fast and efficient. I ordered the double double with fries and a drink. It was amazing! The burger was juicy and tasty. It had lettuce, tomatoes, onion (white), and a special sauce. Yum yum yum. The fries are \"hand cut\" and thin and I actually thought that I was going to like them more than I did. They were a bit bland. Not too bad though. I'm very critical when it comes to the taste and crispiness of my fries. This meal was much needed and so worth every calorie! If you need something fast, delicious, and cheap....come here!",

You can even get only a piece of lettuce and a tomato slice alone (no meat, sauce, pickles, onion or bun) if you want to feel like you are dieting. I don't know if that has a secret menu name, but they'll do it for you and it made the fries I ate with it ok to eat after all  In N Out is so good.

This particular location is in between Harrah's and the Linq hotels. I got there around 2AM and I was surprised that it was not packed. The inside is well lit and looks very clean. The menu is extremely small which I thought would mean faster service. Thankfully my friend ordered for me and I got a double animal style with animal style fries. Animal style means thousand island dressing with grilled onions. The burger was delicious! Nice toasted bun, crispy lettuce, perfectly grilled onions, on top of melted cheese on a grilled meat patty. I was more blown away by it at 2AM than at 7PM the next night. The staff was very friendly and patient. They have a ketchup and hot pepper station which I loved because those are two of my favorite things to add to my burger! Now the fries also came animal style. Thankfully because they were not seasoned and were like thin straw fries. Not a fan of those. All in all, the burgers were pretty good but I was not blown away. I'll stick to 5 Guys or even Cookout.",

(I sometimes go protein style when I don't want bread.)  Having the burger dry (but still juicy) and with no tomatoes really lets you taste the crispness and quality in the meat.  The fries aren't amazing but they're not bad. Cheese fries are amazing. Animal style fries if you're game.  Their house lemonade is also in a league of its own.",

The place was extremely busy (labor day weekend) long wait for food.  The fries were good with all the fixings, but the plain fries were kind of cardboard like. The burgers also lacked the flavor that we remember. After we finished this meal, we already decided that we will head to dean Martin location before flying back to east coast.",

Also did not put enough of their secret sauce on the bun and their french fries are godawful!  they have hardly any taste at all and are not seasoned with anything. Most of the fries were white in color when they should be a golden yellow maybe because they were not cooked enough but either way they were terrible. Strawberry milkshake tasted great but it was too thick to go up the straw I would take Red Robin over this place any day and get a lot more food, much better tasting fries and much faster service for about the same price!!!",

I will say the burgers were very good and the service was excellent. The place was jam packed with people in the heat of a Las Vegas night, and the service was quick and the staff were all very attentive and accommodating. Our one compliant was that our fries were cold and underwhelming. I rate it 3 stars because I wasn't blown away by my experience but the burger was decent. Good not great. Definitely a cheaper option along the Las Vegas strip and it is in a happening and cool area.",

And regardless of what people on Yelp say or don't say, In N Out will always be packed. In n Out should just be given 5 stars on Yelp permanently. Anyone who gives it less than 5 stars should not be allowed to review restaurants.   But now that they are on the Strip in Las Vegas, it behooves me to add yet another 5 star review in the hopes of helping fellow tourists find the best casual food option on the Strip.  In N Out is the gold standard by which all other fast food restaurants should be measured. They value their customers and not just in a lip service type of way. Their restaurants are clean, bright, and shiny. They have a staff of smiling, hustling, efficient workers who can move long lines that would have caused a catastrophic meltdown at other restaurants. They will not compromise on the quality or freshness of their product. They only have a couple items on the menu so that they can do their thing (burgers and fries) and do it exceedingly well. Their burgers are everything that people hype them up to be and more. And \"fairly priced\" doesn't even do justice to their prices because they could DOUBLE their prices and I would still go there the same amount without batting an eye.   Unsurprisingly, I found this location is the same as all of the other In N Outs I have been to in terms of the above qualities. Go. You will not be disappointed.",

We got our number, turned around, and there were probably a crowd of 60/70 ppl waiting for their food. Figuring it'll take a while, we looked for seats. There is a tiny sitting area outside and half of the restaurant has seating, a lot of ppl opt in to sit on the fountain outside. As you can imagine, it's tough finding a seat. Luckily for me, I have no shame in preying on tables and quickly found a seat where a couple was just finishing up. It was about a 10-12 minute wait and then deliciousness. The burger was great, they put their signature animal sauce on it and it was very satisfying. The animal fries were A LOT, there was cheese, caramelized onions and topped with a ton of animal sauce. I've never heard of onions on fries before, but I was feeling adventurous and I'm glad I was. While I enjoyed them, they are definitely not something I would get every time, because like I said, it's a lot. I could not eat all of my fries, I was stuffed after that burger. AND it was the cheapest meal I had in Vegas, only about $21 for 2 ppl. This is a franchise I will definitely be supporting again.",

Forget about the average service and complete lack of hospitality (which you get in spades in most other In-N-Outs), what does this location in is pricing. You will easily pay 30%-40% above standard In-N-Out prices for the same food. I get that the location is in a tourist mall on the Vegas Strip, but when you go to the Starbucks in the same location you pay standard national pricing. If a megalith like Starbucks can do it, why can't a Christian company like In-N-Out do the same?",

Animal style is usually FREE I dont know if it is suppose to be Free here on the strip or not,but I was charged 4.50 for Animal Style Fries,and full price for the shake witch was 2.50. Instead of paying 8.xx something plus tax. I was charged $14.00 dollars total,ya thats right $14.00 dollars!!!!!. When my food was ready the double double had barely any onions or sauce on it, I asked the girl can I get extra onions. than I asked why am I being charged full price for a shake when I asked for the number #1 should just be a upgrade of a 1.xx something of small change,and she couldnt answer,or explain SHIT to me, very Stupid,Young,and Dumb. They food tasted like Crap out of a cleanser sink. So I went to in and out on Nellis and Charleston today to see what would happen if I ordered the #1 off the Strip. I got 2 numbers #1 for a little over $20.xx bucks plus tax. I was dumb founded. If at all possible I would go to the ones off the strip,or be sure to asked if they charge extra for how you want your food. I have photos of last night and today I will also be posting to show you the difference in Quality too!!!",

Granted I didn't get fries or a drink,  but this is a pretty filling burger and a steal for under 4 bucks. If you do visit this location,  prepare to stand on a looooong line and wait,  but it moves rather quickly and they have outdoor seating which if the weather is pleasant,  it's nice to enjoy your burger outside people watching.

    "text": "\"in-n-out ... in-n-out ... that's what a hamburger's all about !\"  The menu is simple : burgers, fries, shakes ... however you want to order it simple or complicated, they'll take care of you.     If I want to be complicated foodie I will order a double single burger extra toasted with extra lettuce and grilled onions cut in half with well done fries with extra spread on the side and strawberry shake (don't judge me) otherwise if I'm being basic ... number 2 with a pink lemonade.  We had tickets to a show at the LINQ so we wanted to grab a quick bite to eat and of course I chose in-n-out.  This location is a bit more expensive then your local in-n-out, but it's expected to be that way because it's the strip.  Also don't be too intimidated by the large crowds, the line moves quite quickly.     I find it from people that either you love in-n-out or you hate it.   I am hands down always a fan.",

First, the fries were cold and hard. How do you expect me to spend calories on cold fries? That's a total waste. Only $7 for a burger, fries and a drink but animal style is $2 more. My burger was good but mostly bread. They serve coke products with DIY free refills but no club soda. What the hell?? Please put a button for just club soda (no syrup).  Also taking off a star because they don't have a bathroom on premise. But the cold, hard fries such a fast paced environment is inexcusable.",

You can get out of here with a double-double meal for under 10 bucks.   I'm sure it's a shitshow during usual busy times but if the Strip in general is slow, this place will be too. I visited on a slow weekday at 11 am and hardly anyone was there, no line to order and got my food in about 5 minutes. I've had way worse waits at In-n-Outs in non tourist areas lol. Not having a drive thru here helps with the wait time too, and it's kinda hidden away on the LINQ promenade where it's not convenient to get to unless you're staying at one of the CET properties just north of Flamingo.",

But line moves really fast.. just a little hard finding a table inside during the day, since it's crazy hot outside.  In and out is still our favorite fast food burger spot, given that my husband is originally from Arcadia CA, maybe he is a bit biased. Haha. However, I do love their burgers, but fries is just average to me. I always ask for their special sauce to dip the fries in or put extra on the burger, and it's free! Free sauce, can make your own animal style fries!  Rideshare from hotel to the linq is super easy now too, it's at the end, by the ferris wheel, where the valet round about is. Last year, it was horrible location, there wasn't reception and you had to go through the linq hotel.  Wish In and Out would open a location in WA.",

    "text": "In-n-out never disappoints and would be hard not to like. In my opinion what makes there burgers is that they properly griddle there buns. There are obviously all sorts of \"secret upgrades\" and combos that you can add to your meal. Really though what In-n-out is (which I appreciate) is good fast food. You can't beat the price for the location, you and another can be full for under $20 that's a steal in this town. Expect to wait in line for a bit, listen for them to call your number out loud and to stand in close quarters while doing so with hoards of other hungry people. You could argue that it's all part of the experience and that the anticipation of watching those ahead of you get there food makes you subconsciously more satisfied when they call your number. Regardless, expect your food to come out nice and hot and to satisfy your burger fix. As I sat and viciously devoured my double double I noticed staff constantly sweeping and wiping down tables, oh and there very friendly, great to see. This would have been a 5 star review except for the fact that my fries were a little bland and boring and they need more seating to accommodate there volume. Great job guys  see you next time.",

As expected the lines can get very long, but that's no surprise considering it's 1 of 2 locations on the Strip (I believe).   As for my opinion of the food, it's very overhyped. I've had better burgers elsewhere. We had the animal style fries and that was really disappointing. It came out lukewarm and just tasted like mayo and cheese splattered over fries... which I guess is what it essentially is but I digress.   My only wish is for this location to be open 24/7.

The prices are very fair, but the food itself leaves something to be desired. It's edible, but not completely enjoyable. I got a double cheese burger with animal style fries. The burger is ooook. Both times I've had it, the patty was a bit overcooked and dry. The fries are the let down. They're always cold and a little stale almost. I was hoping the animal sauce would help, but it was also cold and overly salty. Being from NY, there's always comparison between Shake Shack and this place and I'd pay a little more for Shake Shack any day, but if you're looking for quick (if there's not a huge line/wait for seating and cheap, this does the job.",

This place will almost always be packed though, so be prepared for that. Only reason I gave it a four star is because I think since it is packed, the workers might be in a hurry and try and rush the food they cooked. We went there twice and the burger was pretty pink on the inside. But overall this is a really good spot. People in the west coast love these burgers and I see why.",

Before when I'd come to Vegas, I would hop a cab over to the In-n-out to satisfy my craving for the fatty juicy burgers that would be adding greatness to my handles of love. And then, when there was Lyft/Uber, I started ridesharing it to this fine fast food establishment.    Now I can just cross the friggin street to get a double double or two. Yes, I'll have fries with that.    Definitely one of my favorite fast food burgers. So the fries are fresh and crispy, the burger is tender and juicy and the service is top notch. Nice fresh tomato slices and pieces of lettuce to boot.  The employees were so friggin nice I almost felt like I was on the set of Pleasantville. Food came out reasonably fast despite how busy it was. Who am I kidding? Even if it wasn't fast I would've waited to satiate my craving for this old west coast great.",

    "text": "It's official.  In-N-Out Burger is at the LINQ.  This is also our first In-N-Out on the strip. This was news months ago and the predication was that this location is going to be the busiest In-N-Out ever.  I don't know about that.  The Barstow CA and Tropicana NV location is pretty crazy.    The girlfriend alerted me that this In-N-Out grand opened today and I couldn't resist. I've been to every In-N-Out in Las Vegas/Henderson and wasn't missing a chance at this one, especially since it was the middle of the week. I'm assuming that the lines during the weekends will be cray cray.  There was a line when I arrived, but it's In-N-Out and goes by so quick.  I found one seat open and took it.  I don't know if it's temporary due to grand opening week, but my meal was served to me.  I prefer a Double Double, spread only, extra toast, and well done fries.  But on this visit, I kept it Keto style with two Flying Dutchman's (Two Patties/Two Cheese x 2). Of course I had spread added (awesome sauce!!).  Both Flying Dutchman's were too salty for my liking.  In-N-Out is known for throwing a lot of salt on their patties, but mine was a little too much.  I'll give them a pass since they're new.    This is not your typical In-N-Out.  For one, there's obviously no drive thru.  And two, the prices are bumped up a bit.  For example, a Double Double is normally $3.60.  Here it's $4.35.  Two Flying Dutchman's usually cost me $4.76.  With a drink, I spent close to $9.00.  A Double Double Meal aka a Number 1 is about $1.50 more.  You get the point. The upcharge is due to location and rent must be exceptionally high.  I get it, I just don't agree with it.  This location is not going to be crazy, it's going to be Karazy.  I'm sure they'll make enough to cover expenses.  In my opinion, locals should get a discount.   Overall, I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out.  I just don't see myself going out of the way to eat here.  But if I am at the LINQ and in need of a good burger, then you know where to find me.   TIP #1:  Don't forget about the secret menu.  Animal Style!! TIP #2:  This location has a Company Store. It's small but good to know.   TIP#3: Expect tons of tourist here.  It was cool to watch excited customers walking in and out.  I even witnessed a few hi-fives and cheering.  Poor things...we are so privileged out on the west.    2017 In-N-Out Review #4 / 2017 Yelp Review #31 / In-N-Out Visit This Week #3",

    "text": "To preface this review, I had never been to In-n-Out before and I am from the East Coast. So perhaps take my review with a grain of salt because I'm probably biased. Either way, when I found out that Vegas has In-n-Out, I knew I had to try it - if only to further support my argument that Shake Shack is better.   We arrived in Vegas just 2-3 days after the new In-n-Out opened in the LINQ Promenade, so we didn't have to drive out to bumblefuck in order to get it. The line at about 9:30pm was relatively short and we got our burger relatively quickly. We took them back to our rooms since half of us wanted In-n-Out and the other half wanted Shake Shack (In-n-Out's vegetarian option is...to be it frankly, sad).   The fries, first of all, were just disappointing. They're regular fries - but overly salted fries. I dare to say that even McDonald's fries are better! The burger itself wasn't anything spectacular. I got mine Animal Style and it kind of just tasted like a \"real\" Big Mac. I didn't particularly enjoy it, but I didn't hate it either. My friend from San Francisco has already disowned me.   To be fair, we did eat it after it's been slightly cold. BUT even cold Shake Shack burgers are bomb. Again, I might be biased. Either way, I'd have In-n-Out if it's in the area, but I don't think I'd ever go out of my way to have it again.",

My west coast friends would constantly rave to me about the juicy cheeseburgers and amazing animal style fries that I had to try. As such, those were the things I ordered. Here's what I found...  Pros - Lines were long but orders came flying out  - Service: Although a fast food chain, workers smiled and someone even came to clean up our plates  - Price: The best part. Two \"cheeseburgers\" (animal style is free) and animal fries (not free - surcharge of $2) for $11. Not a bad deal to get you full   Cons - Fries were soggy. Even the ones at the bottom not soaked in cheese were soggy :(  - Burger was good but not great. Lettuce and tomatoes were fresh but the patty was very thin. Bun was the saving grace. Maybe getting a 2x2 or 3x3 would've helped.   Overall: The food was definitely better than McDonalds but I'd prefer five guys or even shake shack. Five guys because their fries are much crispier and burgers can be customized with many more toppings. Shake shake while more expensive, has a better beef patty and much better tasting fries. Personally I think this place is overhyped but maybe it's just the one in Vegas. Will give it another shot when I get to California.",

We went in around 1115 on a weekday thinking 1. people wouldn't be awake yet, or 2. it was too early for lunch. Boy were we wrong on both accounts. It was packed, but the line moved quickly. Soon it became a \"who is quicker\" competition for trying to find a table. For the amount of customers they get, they sure need more seating when the weather isn't that nice outside. Luckily we found a table quickly and our food arrived shortly after (maybe 10 minutes or less).  The burgers were delicious with the grilled onions and special sauce. The fries were a bit cold and stale so I think we would have rather gotten bigger burgers and passed on the fries. The milkshake was super thick to drink through a straw. Walking around with it, the consistency thinned out and we were able to enjoy them.   NOTE: There are no bathrooms at this location.  (When walking by later at night it wasn't super crowded, might be better for a cheap dinner if you don't want to wait.)",

The place itself is clean too, and always busy, so therefore if you're looking to sit down and relax like at a cafe, this is probably not the place for you, but you could still pick up some burgers before going on your way. One tip I would say is to ask for some kids stickers; as an older person, and coming here after a long time, I've realized the stickers are probably what made my waiting a lot more manageable. They're also a great tool to keep kids quiet and focused in the already busy place. Very fun to do yourself, may I include. Great food, great place, definitely check it out!",

I got animal style and fries, and I did like the animal style sauce with the onions but I think I just prefer a thicker, more irregularly shaped burger with grill marks. I wanted more after hearing about it for the past umpteen years from various friends. The fries were good, but I immediately regretted not adding cheese or animal style sauce. My favorite part of the whole meal was the strawberry shake. It was so thick and sweet and made with real ice cream, not some weird milk product.

The meat was seasoned well, and the fries tasted like old school McDonald's fries. Yummy I didn't like the fact that they only have American cheese though. Yuck. So I just opted for it without. It was still good. Also, despite the lines they do move very quickly to get you \"in and out\". I'd recommend.",

The fries were okay, they were just whatever fries. My friend got a burger, and she enjoyed that it was cooked medium and said the meat had a great taste.   The only bad thing is when she ordered she asked for a \"hamburger, make sure it's not a cheeseburger.\" Then she got a plain burger on a bun with no condiments, lettuce, or tomatoes. Then she went to the counter to correct it and they gave her a cheeseburger with all the condiments, and it needed to be corrected again. Everyone was very friendly and helpful though.",

    "text": "We came around 6:45 PM and line up was out the door. It was probably due to the holiday and everyone was in Vegas. I ordered a double double with onions to go. Even though there were a lot of people waiting to order, the cashier didn't rush anything but also repeated my order to confirm they got it right. I really appreciated that. However, the line up for pick up was just ridiculous. It was chaotic: people who just ordered stood in front of the counter even though there was already a line formed. There was absolutely no order here and I literally had to push my way through to get my food.   I enjoyed my double double. The two beef patties tasted great. The amount of the sauce was just right, it didn't make the bun all soggy and a mess to eat. It was definitely better than McDonalds. Other than that, it was nothing special. In-N-Out Burger is a great and cheap option if you are looking for a quick fix. However, that also depends on how bad the line up is, in that case, you might not be \"in-n-out\" at all.",

Plus, as an east coast gal I have to make it a point to eat here since I'm deprived back home.  The only thing I have to say as a con is that while the service is incredibly fast for considering how many people go through the queue a day, it's also a bit sloppy. I asked for no animal style on my burger yet it still came with it. I ate it anyway because the line was too hectic and not worth it to change. Also, you have to scout and hunt for a table while one person waits for your food. That's the only way to do it. I felt like a vulture the moment someone was cleaning up their trash. I had to pounce!   But that's part of the experience I suppose. Overall delicious burgers at a great price.",

I've been here 3 times, and each time the line is really long, but it always seems to go by quickly.   I couldn't find a restroom, so it's a secret path out here in there and it'll take about 8 minutes to walk. Wouldn't recommend for elderly.

Living in NYC, we are deprived of In-N-Out (although we do have Shake Shack) so I had to give it a try to see what the hype is about. The burgers are made to order so you should expect to wait 5-10 minutes for your food. In an attempt to be a little healthier, I ordered a double-double protein style (no-bun). At just under $5, this was well worth it. Good burger, good sauce. I had some of my brother's animal style fries which were quite underwhelming (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). The cheese is just a slice of what seems to be a kraft single melted over the fries with onions and sauce.   Shake Shack over In-N-Out  In-N-Out over Five Guys",

The special sauce they put on there burgers is delicious! You can also get the sauce on the side they serve it in packets it goes great with your fries. There fries are also delicious! Of course they are always busy especially this location but the line goes really quick they take your order then give you a order number on your receipt then you wait until they call your number they are really quick and well worth the wait.

I thought it was very tasty.  & Since I have owned & operated restaurants, I especially liked watching their modus operanda & dissecting it to see what makes it tick.  The Formula works.  How the team turned out 70 fresh accurate orders in 25 minutes is a mystery to me.  Kudos to their unique system.  It's obviously a tightly-run ship.    I conversed with the Manager, who was minding the Merchandise Store.  California, 1948 . . . This is the only store that is not freestanding.    As the chain grew, in order to ensure high quality & consistency, the Owners resisted franchising or going public.  Textbook success.    The chain is currently owned by the only Granddaughter of the Founders, who will continue to open new stores, but has no plans to franchise or sell.",

The carmelized onions/thousand island dressing add a bit of sweetness to compliment the flavor note.   The fries are shoestring and fresh cut.  They have that homemade taste.  These are my favorite fast food fries.  All in all, In n Out is a great example of how a fast food operation should be ran.

Not really unique to this location, but it was packed and we were lucky to snag a table (which was dirty). The sign outside says 'no delay' which is misleading as it took us ten minutes to get through the line and another fifteen for our food. I wish the hours were expanded a bit later than 1 AM. I can tell you that this place would see business at any hour of the day if they were open 24 hours, not sure why that isn't a thing since the Starbucks next door can pull it off.

I ordered just a hamburger with extra lettuce, tomatoes and grilled onions (not animal style, but my personal style) and it came out to about 4$! The burger looked beautiful when it came with all the beautiful toppings peaking through and when I bit into it, the top bun was warm but the bottom was cold. The bun was also a little bit hard and the meat was quite eager compared to Shake Shack. Even so, I was gladly satisfied at this must go West Coast USA joint.",

    "text": "Let's kick back way old school - remember when you couldn't get Coors east of Colorado (yes dating myself) and my Dad would smuggle out a six pack (ON THE PLANE) and we would crack a ice cold beer in the Midwest and swear it was the greatest beer ever -- and now it is just Coors - its okay on a hot day but way way down the list of best beers.  Which begs the question, is my love for In-N-Out just a function of it's relative inaccessibility or its excellent.  Probably a bit of both - as far as the In-N-Out on the Strip (on is also relative - sort of on more precise) goes you don't just get a great burger and fries - the place comes with a show.  By show I don't mean dancing girls (although I am not ruling it out) by show I mean ever single segment of society smushed into a small restaurant - mostly drunk - all hungry - at midnight - hangry for some seared beef perfection.  So there I am - dressed business casual - with multiple shirtless dudes, bachelorettes and whole host of Vegas finest - all congregating peacefully while waiting for our number to be called and shove the Double into our face.  The five star review may not be applicable at ever hour of the day - but at midnight after entertaining clients all day - eating practically nothing - the Double at In-N-Out is one of the greatest things in creation - and you need it Animal Style because of course you do and I don't really even know what Animal Style means.  The patties are cooked perfect - cheese is melty - lettuce and tomato super fresh - bun holds up to the beef and toppings and it is just the best late night meal.  Also went Animal Style on the fries - probs not absolutely necessary but yes on the burger.  As much as I would like to see In-N-Out move east - I think my preference is to maintain the mythical status of the once a year late night calorie explosion in Vegas when I never have to consider it just another burger.",

Fountain machines are in the dining area and refills are free (and definitely the cheapest fountain soda I could find at under $2!). Coke products-yay!!!

The experience was almost on-par to McDonald's, but worse.   Yep, this goes under the big ol' book of fails.   You'll be fighting for seating during peak hours, but the staff was pretty nice and on it, which is why I'm adding a star to the experience.   Nope, nope and more nope.

AND...... whenever we go to Vegas, our first stop off the plane is to....you guessed it. They are quite packed in Vegas so we always have a Plan B and Plan C location to fall back on. Imagine my amazement when I found out that this burger haven now has a location right off the Vegas Strip. It is officially listed as at The Linq, but is right around the corner from The Flamingo Hotel in the alleyway leading to the Giant Ferris Wheel. Now we were able to walk there after checking into our hotel. As with other locations, the crowd was plentiful but the young staff was quite efficient in filling the orders and getting the food in your hands in a reasonable time. My wife in the meantime secured a nice table outside. So, that's where the good review ends with the pleasant and efficient staff. They get the one star that I have awarded. As for the food......my love of all In-N-Outs has come crashing down to earth. I ordered my usual Double-Double and Fries. The burger which is usually juicy, was cooked beyond recognition. It was horribly overdone and I actually threw it out after eating half of it. My wife's was the same. Now, they can't also screw up the freshly made Fries, can they? Yes they can and they did! These Fries were so overdone, charred and dried out that they were like those dry straws you buy in a bag or can. How can they mess up what every other location has brilliantly delivered? I hope I'm not scarred for life, but for sure will never visit this location again. Hopefully it was an off day, but I won't be around to find out. Back to Plan B & C.",

When waiting for my order, we attempted to find seating and there was none available. The wait time to receive our food was quite long because they were very busy. Eventually other guests left and we were finally able to find seating after about 15-20 min.   Once we received our food, it wasn't up to the normal In-N-Out standard I'm used to in CA. The buns seemed a little dry and would crumble a little when you would hold it. The French fries were definitely a disappointment. They were so salty we couldn't really finish them.   Because we were so hungry, the food did its job but overall I probably won't come to this location again.",

Not only was the food spot on - delicious tasting and traditionally priced - but this location was also great for people watching. If you catch my drift.   Animal style all the way, my friends.",

    "text": "After pining for In-N-Out for months (I live on the east coast) I was so excited for my In-N-Out experience. I hate to say I was disappointed. We waited a very long time for our food. They called all the numbers around us, but not our number. Eventually I went to the counter to ask about my food- it had been sitting there the whole time and they never called our number! My burger and fries were cold as a result. The burger party itself was small and had too much sauce (I ordered it animal style) I'm not sure I'll go back on my next west coast trip.",

    "text": "My wife and I came to Vegas last week and top of my list of places to eat was in-n-out. I'd read all the great reviews online and seen YouTube videos of people proclaiming their love of the best burgers and fries ever, we ordered the double cheeseburgers, animal style fries and chocolate shakes. What happened next was both surprising and heartbreaking, it SUCKED. The fries and the blandest fries I've ever had, I can see why people put all the sauce and cheese on them otherwise it's like eating cardboard. The burger was average at best, I'd rate 5 guys, fat burger, McDonald's etc way above it. We ate maybe 10 fries each and half the burgers and binned the rest. Obviously people and just drinking the in-n-out cool aid and believing all the hype because this is nowhere near all it's cracked up to be. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 star review was because the staff are all very friendly and it's actually a nice restaurant inside.",
