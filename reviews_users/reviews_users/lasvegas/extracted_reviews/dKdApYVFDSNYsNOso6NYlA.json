    "text": "Some reviews on here are too much in depth and have over complicated something so very simple.   Simply put, White Castle is a classic burger joint that is known for their small square burgers. Over the years, they've added other delicious items such as chicken sliders, cheese fries and fish sliders to name a few.   I stopped by here earlier in the week to have some burgers, chicken fries and fries. I grew up with a few in my area back in the day, and haven't had any for a while since they've been closed. The food was fresh and hot here! Prices are much higher here but we all know why. Service was excellent, and our cashier offered sauces without having to ask. Will definitely visit this location again!",

Not as bad as Disneyland. The employees and volunteers were awesome. Everyone had a great attitude. It took about 40 mins to get to the front of the line, then once inside there was another small line of about 20 people deep.  Right before we got inside, they started giving out free regular sliders as samples. I seriously thought about getting out of line after the sample. The beef is literally 1/8\" thick. It's $1.09 for a plain slider, $1.50 for one with cheese. You would have to layer probably three patties to get it the same thickness of say a $1 burger at McD's.  Imagine if you ordered a $1 burger at a fast food place and got a White Castle style slider. You'd be pissed right? But people are lining up for these and buying them by the box! You can add on extra pickles or onions for no charge, otherwise there is only one pickle. No sauce either, but you can ask for ketchup, mayo, etc.  They have $5 shakes too, but no bourbon in them. They didn't even fill it to the top!  Food 1 star Value/price 1 star Service and employees 4 star Got to hang out with Nik O and say hi to Niyen 5 star Likeliness of my returning 0 star  I've never had White Castle before, and now I can say I did. I don't get what the big deal is though. In N Out hands down.",

    "text": "This place is for sure a 5 Star experience so you all need to get down to the Strip to try this place out for sure.  The Ambiance - While you are waiting in line, you will get to speak to so many people from the Mid or East Coast where they all grew up having White Castle Sliders.  I mean these peeps have lived on them and this is the comfort food of their generation.  It is so cool, that I, being a West Coaster, was able to learn about how WC was part of people's lives!!!  The Wait - Not so bad. We went at 9:30 on Sunday right after Church..... We prayed for a short line and our total wait to be in line, order and then get the food was only 30 minutes.  When we left at 10:20, there was actually no one in line in the street and only about 25 people waiting inside.  The Food Experience - It is certainly interesting that you are paying about a $1.10 to $1.20 for a slider. It is very expensive overall.  However, that being said, that little itty bitty piece of meat, that is razor thin and about 2\"x2\", with the two pickles and a quarter piece of processed cheese and chopped grilled onions is not bad. The bread is very soft and the perfect taste. Not too tasty and not bland. Just right. This little slider will not win any taste awards, but it is very edible and certainly evokes memories for so many.  This falls in line with grilled cheese and chicken noodle soup or even Mac and Cheese as go to comfort foods that is just right.  The Food rating - Nevertheless, lets face it, man cannot live on fond memories alone and so, the quality taste of the food has to be key and in this case, the Sliders themselves do not taste very good at all. They are pretty basic actually.  The crinkle fries are absolutely horrible and I would suggest naming them droopy fries, because they lack any crispiness at all. These are the most floppy and soggy fries ever. The amount you pay for the quantity you get is absolutely laughable.  We ordered loaded fries as well and these were looking like some 10 year old whipped it up and put it together.  There is not an ounce of artistic gourmet quality in this little burgers.  The Service - Not bad. The security that helps the line flow are very good quality. the cashiers are a bit new and this is taking a bit of time. They are not totally connected with the entire process and ordering and etc.    Buy why? - I wonder why put this  small restaurant in such a location? Horrible location, small, no easy way to get here if you are local.  I will be coming back, with friends or guest, but not for the burgers, for the experience. Out of context and just taken alone, the burgers are just as good as twinkies and hoho's are to desserts. In the context of the whole experience, very good place to go.  GK says, check it out.",

    "text": "Let's get this out of the way: this is not a foodie destination whatsoever. However, it's a way for people not from the Midwest or the East Coast to experience this cornerstone of American culture and history.  I was quite disappointed when I tasted the overly hyped White Castle offering at Las Vegas Foodie Fest. It was very mediocre and I couldn't believe that they would eat this stuff fanatically. When they decided to open an actual restaurant in response to the crowds, I decided that I'd have to give it a shot. Perhaps the sliders at Foodie Fest weren't quite \"the real thing.\"  I parked at Harrah's. You might consider the Mirage across the street, the Venetian to the north, or the Linq slightly farther south, but I think Harrah's is pretty convenient. I happened to bypass the line (it's possible if you take a side door or just walk through Casino Royale) because I wasn't looking to stand in line at all. The line was watched by private security and extended onto the sidewalk outside the \"White Castle\" door.  The menu prices tend to be absurd, so I was really glad that Antonia R. and Renzo were kind enough to share some of their large order. Not that anyone should wander in here alone, but you really should share a 10-slider sack or a \"Crave Case\" of 30 sliders with friends/family if you don't want to end up paying $8 for four tiny sliders, awful fries, and a cheap soda.  In light of that comment, I'll discuss the sides first. The french fries are really, really bad. They're soggy crinkle-cut fries with barely any crispiness or salt. Pretty much every other fast food chain can beat this handily. The onion chips, on the other hand, are surprisingly awesome. They're crunchy and not overly greasy. They're like onion rings but in a small enough size so that you won't have that issue of eating the entire onion portion while trying to bite the onion ring into smaller pieces. Definitely skip the fries and get the onion chips if you come here.  As I'd anticipated, the sliders here had much more flavor than whatever they were serving before. You can taste some savory flavors from the almost paper-thin patties, enjoy the soft bun, and notice the grilled onions and pickle. I actually found the cheese on the cheese sliders to be a distraction. The cheese just obscured the other flavors without providing much flavor of its own. Order the original sliders.  Look, you really shouldn't go here unless you've never been to White Castle. You'll get more meat at a lower price at pretty much any other fast food place, even those on the Strip. But if you do decide that you must have the experience, make sure you're aware of the prices and strongly consider bringing a group.",

    "text": "Mmmm White Castle...brings me back to my college days every time I visit one! I was stoked when I heard they were opening a WC in Vegas because that means I no longer have to seek them out when traveling back to the Midwest. I knew the crowds would be bad so I waited a couple weeks before checking it out. But little did I know there would still be crowds and long lines! If you come to this location, expect to wait in 2 separate lines: 1 outside to get into the store and another to order once you get inside. The security guards were a little rude during this whole process, which may turn me off from this location for a while, at least until the lines die down a little.  This location is also much more expensive than other WC locations I've been to...probably because it's located on the Las Vegas Strip versus some southside hood. The food is on par with any other WC's and is something people either love or hate. You'll never meet someone that just thinks White Castle is alright. They will either love it or hate it and this one is no exception.   My favorites here are the cheeseburger sliders and chicken rings. Their fries suck so I would stay away from those. I thought maybe this location would be different because it would be fresher due to higher turnover from the crowds but nope...still sucks! They had a full staff working and the food comes out surprisingly fast for the amount of customers they're serving. Like all their locations, this one is 24/7 so you can get your fix anytime!",

Those little hamburger / cheeseburgers were delicious! Even as an adult now I would pick up a box from the freezer section from time to time.  So naturally I would assume freshly made would taste better than the freezer section. Sadly this was not the case. I'm not really sure how to describe it... the sliders were actually bland and soggy.  And the smell / stench... I'm not sure where it was coming from. Either the casino or the actual \"restaurant\" (the White Castle is located in the casino; open space) or a combination of both... but it was unpleasant! We quickly ate the sliders so we can get out of there as fast as we can.   Placing the order and picking up the food went very smoothly and quickly. The cashier and the lady that handed me the food was also very polite. So no complaints about that.  Absolutely skip this location and satisfy your White Castle slider cravings for your local freezer section!",

Thought we were going to have to wait 30+ minutes to get our order but it only took about 15 min. The burgers are VERY TINY like...mini sliders tiny...but they're pretty delicious to snack on. It's not expensive either! If you're a girl who can eat, I'd say to order about 3-4 burgers and a side of crinkled fries and you're good to go. For guys, maybe 6-8 burgers? But if you're REALLY hungry...I think 10 should do it LOL!  As for parking, you might want to self park at one of the neighboring hotels nearby and walk over because parking is nonexistent.",

The food was very good.  We started with the sliders combo with fries and a soda.  The sliders were awesome. One silder was clearly not enough among the three of us. We ended up ordering the fish slider.  That too was awesome.  The other great thing about our first experience was the service.  Excellent service!  The employees were very kind.

Before this experience, I've only ever had frozen White Castle burgers that I bought from Safeway (those were horrible). The real deal was much better.  I'd say give it a shot! It's cheap junk food, so of course it's not going to be perfect. If you're coming here looking for a medium-rare wagyu burger, I suggest you take your hipster ass somewhere else. White Castle isn't your fancy gourmet burger shop, it's a quick stop for a quick snack, and it does not disappoint.",

Especially after Harold & Kumar took a wonderful journey just to go to one of these White Castles.  Let's get down and dirty. In & Out still reigns supreme for fast food burger joints. It beats this by miles! It also beats the East Coast's Shake Shack if you look at it as a whole in terms of value/quality etc. Where Shake Shack actually serves up good quality food, despite a higher price than In & Out (In & Out serves good quality food at a great price--thus why it's hard to beat), White Castle on the other hand tastes as good as it looks--and go look at the pictures.  The burgers are tiny, and thus why they serve them in multiples when you order a combo. Usually 4 or 6 etc. They are served in those signature boxes. We just got the cheeseburgers for our first time experience. The food is a BIG BIG \"MEHHHH\".   Nothing special at all. Like I said, taste as good as it looks, and it's not much to look at.   This location is located inside the Casino Royale. It has it's own entrance from outside the strip, but it is not an isolated space of it's own. Once you go inside you will see the casino floor on the right. So if you were hoping to not be exposed to smoke, think again. The staff all seemed great though, despite being hectic opening week.  I'm just glad I got it out of the way and was able to say I've tried it.",

Prior I had only had White Castle from the frozen section but frozen can never measure up to the freshly prepared sliders. So on my first night out in Vegas for my company's annual trip and after a jillion glasses of Rieslings later, my boss (who is from Detroit) took me and my co workers here. We walked all the way from New York New York! Since it was my first time going to a White Castle restaurant I kept it simple and ordered six sliders and fries. The sliders were even better than the packaged ones! I think is the the fresh onions that give the sliders that bang. However I would say the fries were nasty because they were hard and cold. I complained about it all night. There was no wait because we received our food pretty fast. Hey a drunk can't tell no tales.

The food was served quickly.....not usually the case at most White Castles! Burgers were what we expected but the chicken was full of grizzle and had me very dissatisfied in that department. Yes, it was dirty and the drink station a mess but there was a worker cleaning. I chalked that up as that they were busy. Management probably needs to put someone in the seating area cleaning at all times just to keep up on the traffic and mess!  Would I go back....if in Vegas again....

    "text": "I feel compelled to review this White Castle mainly because of the stream of slightly negative reviews.  First things first, White Castle does not serve a killer gourmet 16 ingredient big burger.  They're small simple classic sliders from the oldest American fast food chain.  People who have had them both crave it and are nostalgic for it.  Bottom line is to appreciate for what it is.  Simple.  We went here on a Harold and Kumar esk trek from Downtown LV.  The location is convenient to guests of the Casino Royale or any strip hotel connected to it.  Way less convenient for all others.  We parked in Harrah's which is fairly close and you can walk to the joint inside the casino as Harrah's and Casino Royale are connected.  Parking is free and the walk is less than 5 mins.   I've heard a lot about the insane lines so we opted to go when all others are asleep at 5am.  Yes, burgers for breakfast!!  Walked up and ordered in less than 2 minutes and food served 5 minutes after that.  Employees were friendly and obviously over whelmed by the onslaught of customer pouring in all day.  I was impressed they were so positive and that's certainly not been my experience in White Castles past.  The crew were bantering with each other making for a positive vibe which was nice especially if you've getting beat down by the casinos.  I'd say enjoy the multitude of employees that are working in anticipation of the crowds because when it's slow its still fresh and super fast.  There's a couple of workers constantly cleaning so the place is well kept and clean.  Another nice change based on my past experiences with this chain else where.  The set up can make the view from the strip looking in deceiving.  While it may look like there's a large crowd it could just be people eating their food and standing around.  The dining area is toward the strip and the ordering area is inward.  I'd say a good rule is if you see a line extending out doors then ok it's a long line.  Else you should check inside cause the line may not be that long.  We had the 20 originals with 2 fries combo for $28.  Just over a buck each which is standard.  They could gouge us but I'm glad to see they didn't.    We have eaten these many times so having these without being in the mid west is a treat indeed.   These little suckers and simple and tasty.  Soft bun, slim patty, grilled onions and a garlic-esk seasoning makes em tasty.  They pretty much melt in your mouth which I love.  Swallow em whole I say (I can't btw)!  Average person can probably eat about 3-5.  We had 10 each.  Don't Judge!!!  We weren't drunk or stoned.  Fries are crinkle cut and crispy.  Add some salt.  Get one order fries for every 5 sliders.  Bottom line is that it's a White Castle for those who have had em.  The same except this one is very modern and much cleaner than those I've been.  For Noobs, don't buy into the hype.  Keep in mind, where these are from, they are very convenient, never crowded, and relatively cheap.  Don't expect a miracle in a burger and you'll find they are great by their own right.  These things have character like that cool friend everyone knows but nobody sees.    Looking forward to having more next time I'm in town.  Congrats Vegas!  Lucky you.",

But now, it's made it's way to the main strip of Vegas, which is great news for those of us who don't want to journey to the east coast just for these little sliders.  Truth be told, I was totally unimpressed. The burgers were inconsistent, lukewarm, and tasted bland. Some had pickles, some didn't. I was missing cheese on some of my cheese sliders too. I'm sure this is due to how crazy busy the place has been ever since it opened a couple of a weeks ago. Hopefully they get all the kinks worked out soon. Also, this White Castle is pretty pricey. A combo with 4 sliders, fries, and a drink will cost you $7.99. Add cheese to them and it's $8.99. Kind of expensive for pretty mediocre food if you ask me.  Open 24 hours but there seems to always be a line! We went for lunch on a Monday and there was a line out the door. It's probably because of all the hype since it just opened. Definitely worth a try just to see what the fuss is about, but now that I've tried it, I'll probably pass next time unless things improve. Located across from the Mirage.",

There are very few places in Las Vegas where you can get a meal for under $10, aside from your typical McDonalds, Subway, Panda Express...White Castle is just another fast food option.  I came here the second week of opening and there are still long lines. If you don't like waiting an hour for sliders, come during the graveyard shift and the wait becomes only 10-15 minutes. Management still needs to train its employees better. All their trash bins were full at 10pm, and no staff was emptying out the trash, leaving piles of WC boxes stacked up a mile high. But I believe once the hype dwindles down, WC management will figure out what changes need to be made for this location.  I'll be back White Castle!",

    "text": "Being a self proclaimed burger expert I had been waiting to come here for ages. Last time I came to Vegas I didn't find out there was a white castle here till I had left. This time however I made a point to come here. Now I've been eating quality burgers my whole life and yes I can be a little critical at times. However when I came to white castle in Vegas I was in a very vulnerable position. I was extremely hungover, even a big Mac would have made me happier than anyone could imagine.  So I naturally got in line and asked what I should order since it was my first time at white castle. I got a very vague response that the beef was good and that the chicken was good as well. With this information I order 4 beef sliders, 2 chicken sliders, fries and a drink for a total of around $17. I got the food a short time later and was very unimpressed. For $17 back in Cali I can get some very quality burgers and great service from a well known restaurant that has locations all along the west coast, Nevada, and Texas.   These burgers were very bland and tasteless. I tried using the sauces provided and they didn't really help very much at all. The food just lacked any kick or flavor. It tasted like something that was pulled out of the frozen food section, microwaved and then given to me.   If anyone from Cali is reading this, we aren't missing out on anything by not having white castle. The east coast however y'all definitely missing out on not having in n out.",

I parked at the Venetian and walked over to White Castle (it's in front of the Casino Royale) and I wouldn't recommend it...there's a small alleyway with a sign that says \"Casino Royale Best Western Entrace\" inbetween the Casino Royale and the Venetian and I will try that if I ever go back.  The wait was not too bad.  There were like 3 sloppy security guards inside...dirty, uniforms didn't fit, bad weaves, etc.   They shorted me 1 slider.  All 4 people who ate them got diarrhea.  TMI?",

The sliders weren't bad but they weren't amazing either. The fries and onion rings were pretty good in my opinion.  I hate the location because it's a pretty far walk from the parking garage.",

Nothing but drunk people screaming at the workers and women with barely any clothes on walking around. I really felt as if I was in a nasty club with really bad lighting.   It took almost an hour to get my food, the workers looked tired, overworked, and unappreciated. I felt so bad people were yelling at them cursing them out saying mean things to them, It was really bad.   On top of that, I ordered the chicken rings and try were extremely dry and hard. The shake was about 7 dollars and not great. Overall I wont be coming back, but I hope that the people that work here can get a nice vacation some day because what they go through is atrocious.",

What we ordered was the cheese burger slider which came with 4 cheeseburgers a regular fries and a drink. The sliders had pickles cheese and onions. It was soft and good. But if youre a big burger eater i suggest you order their crave packs that have 10 or more depending on how hungry you are. The buns were soft meat was soft too kinda reminds me of a meatloaf in a way but a good meatloaf lol.  We also ordered the onion ring chicken slders it came two sliders regular fries and a drink. The chicken sliders were good it reminded me burger kinds chicken fries. The other stuff we ordered on the side was onion chips theyre like onion rings but turned into bite size pieces of goodness. We also had the bacon ranch fries theyre crinkled cut fries loaded with bacon ranch and cheese. It was pretty good. The other thing I ordered was a vanilla shake it was thick and yummy. Above all I would come bk the lines are long but once you order your food comes out pretty fast. They have an assembly line going on in front of you so you can see what theyre doing to your food. The best part is it's open 24 hours 7 days a week. The location is in between Venetian and Harrahs inside the Casino Royale. Oh yeah they also serve beer for all you beer lovers :-)",

I remember getting them for .10 cents a burger. lol. I will admit that it is a little pricey but then again, you are paying to be on The Strip.   I wanted to add an additional side note on the service. Of  the 3 times I have visited White Castle here on the strip, I have had the fortunate pleasure of having Nohemi take my order at the counter.

The western most outpost of the east coast chain is at the Casino Royale between Harrah's and the Venetian.  Veterans know what to expect. White Castle specializes in small burgers called sliders with a thin beef patty grilled in onions. You order several paired with fries or chicken rings, although I always recommend doubling down on the sliders as the fries are rather basic.  The real value comes from the large packs of sliders. You can get a bag or case of them to take back to the room for a cheap price. The restaurant is nice to eat in with basic decorations and easy access.  It's nice to see some east coast classics make their way to Las Vegas. White Castle is not the best burger on the strip, but it's comforting to have them as a fun option while visiting.",

    "text": "One time I had White Castle in Ohio. I was on tour playing drums with a band at the time and I always remember my mother talking about White Castle and how much her and her friends loved it when growing up in Detroit. Mom liked it so it must be yummy. Mom is not always rights.   Putting my crappy first White Castle experience behind me I (very drunkenly) decided to dive back in during my last trip to Las Vegas. I told my friends I was going to bed and then lined up with all of the other schmucks for about twenty minutes. Women had their heels in their hands, guys had to be held up by their buddies, and the leisurely pace of the staff was in no hurry to get the line of disorderlies served and out the door. This can't end well.   Eventually I landed a bag of sliders, fries and a Sprite and I couldn't make it to my hotel room fast enough to devour these little gut bombs. When I finally plopped down and my tiny hotel room table I massacred the bag of burgers and they were truly awful, but for some odd reason I couldn't stop. Hunger does funny things to people and this was a prime example of me making a very bad decision. They were cold, soggy, and basically tasted like a piece of wet cardboard that had been folded in half a few times. Garbage I tell ya. Absolute garbage.   After all is said and done I'd like to tell you that I'll never return but that would be a lie. Next time I'm drunk in Vegas I'll be in that 5am line with the rest of the drunken scumbags waiting for a hefty dose of processed crap. Cheers!",

It's an east coast thing but since we weren't planning to fly to the east coast anytime soon, we stopped here for a snack to try it out.   SERVICE - The cashier was nice. Think fast food joint. Order at the register and they call your number.   FOOD Cheeseburger Sliders - Okay, obviously this place is a gimmick especially due to the publicity from Harold & Kumar. The sliders were  on soggy buns. The meat was a frozen patty thrown on the grill. The onions came from a Tupperware of onions. Who knows how long they have been sitting in there. The cheese was processed cheese. You get the idea.   Fries - Frozen fries thrown into the fryer. We could actually taste freezer burn with the batch that we got.  Overall, cannot say it was good but I don't think it was meant to be good. Think cafeteria food, that is what it was. We did not come in expecting to have amazing burgers or fresh anything but more so to be able to check off that we ate it thanks to Harold & Kumar. If you're looking for quality food, turn away! If you want to be able to say you've tried it, this is the spot for you.",

We went to Vegas and slave girl has never been to white castle yet, so for love, I went to another bad place to eat.   The service was actually good. The lady at the counter was super friendly and very pleasant. Ordering was easy and fast. Good job. We ordered a 10 pack burger with 6 pc chicken ring and loaded fries.   Now on with the food. White castle burgers are cheap but small. The burger patty was thinner than a sausage patty but flavorful. However, the flavor was not the typical burger flavor and I wasn't a fan of that taste. The chicken ring was nuggets smashed with a hole in the middle. Dry and nasty. Our friend ordered this onion thing but it was also dry with almost no trace of onion.   The only thing that was decent was the loaded fries. I think we just liked bacon.   All and all, you gotta wonder why eating White Castle in Vegas when we were surrounded with some of the best restaurants in the country. Slave girl said never again, lol.",

Guess the arguing, loud and busy doesn't bother you when you've had 32 ounces of alcoholic beverages on the strip of Las Vegas.  The food was not even impressive as a drunk, so I tried it again sober and still not impressed.  I guess I am missing the hype..... went down the street to In-N-Out and found it....sorry!",

It was alright. So the Sliders are made out of 2 mini buns, chopped onions, pickle and meat. Onions were carmelized. Meat was very thin, the flavor was mostly from the carmelized onions. And one pickle was placed in each slider.   Honestly, I've had way way better sliders at other restaurants. I'm not sure what the hype is about this place. I don't think this place can make anyone full unless they 'Buy them by the sack'. It's a good place to snack.  I also got Loaded Fries. They were pretty good.",

We particularly liked the fish slider which I thought was a cut above McDonald's Filet-O-Fish. The crinkle fries were okay. 'Try the crunchy onion bits.

You stare at the menu and wonder how this place is still up and running because there's like five things on the menu?   You get six \"burgers\" (cause they are the size of half of your palm), fries, and onion chips. You watch as they make the burgers and it doesn't look appetizing but you give it the benefit of the doubt. When it's time, you grab your order and dig in. A frown forms on your lips because they don't taste anything like you'd hope. They're soggy, flavorless, and small. The fries are the same. This meal's saving grace is the onion chips.

    "text": "White Castles are not a common sight in Los Angeles county.  Friends say that they were once plentiful, but I understand that they have retreated to the comfort of the east coast. Save this one. This White Castle is all alone out here in Vegas. So, it was on my list of things to see and experience in Las Vegas. I'd never had one. Not even from the grocery store. I'd even seen all three of the Harold & Kumar movies about them. I was super excited. Well done White Castle!       So, I parked my ride back at the LINQ self parking, and hiked down this way to get to the Treasure Island for the Pirate ship battles and the Marvel thingy. It was quite of a hike to thie point. Several times I pondered giving up and taking the Monorail. But I persevered, and this was a well deserved stopping point. The Las Vegas strip is deceptively long.        As I entered there was a bit of a line at the counter when I walked in. The sounds of the nearby casino jingled and buzzed and tempted through a huge opening in one wall. I assume the White Castle is open at all hours to collect the hungry gamblers. Which is probably alot, as the smell of burgers wafted across my nose as I looked up at the great big menu to figure out what I wanted. Looking at the items, the prices ranged within your usual 'fast food prices'.      There was a range of options. Meat, other Meat. Fake Meat. No Meat. All the glutens, none of the glutens. Even Vegetarian and probably Vegan options. I saw a sign for a double cheeseburger combo (little teeny ones) and decided that's what I wanted. I wound my way through the line and got to a register, and ordered one from the nice lady behind the counter.     I was given a cup and a receipt. I took both to find a place to sit. Easier said than done. This place was pretty popular. Eventually I found one at a high common table. I set my camera bag and phone on the table corner to mark it as being taken. As I went over to get an iced tea, I heard my number called. I altered my trip back to my table, and veered back over towards the counter to pick up my tray of food. I was excited, I was eager. I was going to try White Castle burgers. I reached into my bag and withdrew the three small boxes inside.      Hrm. These three tiny things are supposed to fill up me? Seriously? Hrm. Ok. After the yelp photo, I carefully pulled out the miniscule burgers, doing my best to save the buns from ripping. I excitedly took a bite of one. It was okay? I was not as awed and amazed as Harold and Kumar were. I wasn't overwhelmed and taken away on a meaty dream sequence of awesomeness. I was just kinda sorta whelmed.     Even the iced tea was that fountain done stuff. Not brewed iced tea. Meh. I'd have rather been eating a Carl's Jr. Big Carl. But. I'd finally experienced it. Checked it off my list. That's part of the excitement of life I suppose. To get out there and try new things. Sometimes they're just not as great as the commercials.",

I love the little buggers, but I'm not exactly a craver! This location does a decent enough job of preparing them, and they sell beer! However they are priced considerably higher due to it being on the Strip! Hence my 3 star rating!

I finally got the real thing in Chicago and it was pretty damn good especially for the price. So how's this White Castle in Vegas?   Nothing special sadly. There was just something missing. Not only were the prices higher here, the quality was definitely off. Where they took their time in Chicago putting these sliders together, things were rushed out of the kitchen at this location. These sliders were made with hate and you can taste it. The cheese unmelted, the burgers smashed into its containers, and the flavors sorely lacking. Where is the caramelized onion flavor white castle is known for? I thought an establishment that sold out within hours of its grand opening would present something better than cafeteria food.",

They have no White Castle in Hawaii where I'm from.  We had just eaten at a buffet but I had to try this place out. I just got a cheese slider. My hubby got the chicken ring slider combo, which came with fries and a drink. I know that their sliders are small, but it must have shrunk some more because it was tiny. The hamburger patty was paper thin but it was tasty. They serve crinkle cut fries and not shoestring. At least the fries were crispy and not soggy.   The wait time for our three sliders and fries was 20 minutes. I guess this must be a popular place on the mainland.",

It's a 24/7 location which means sometimes service can be hit or miss, but their staff were absolutely cheerful for a 6 am on a random Wednesday in February.

    "text": "Questions: Did I eat at the same place that all the other reviewers did? How much did they get paid or how much did they smoke? Also, what was Harold thinking?  Before I go on a rant let's try to find the positives and try to write an unbiased review minus any hype. First off all the servers were incredibly friendly. The menu was easy to read basically pick a number between 1 and 100 to determine how many mini boxes you will get. Everything on the menu is colorful and photogenic.   Cliff notes Summary: 1. Equal or lesser quality to the frozen store brand 2. If your mind is telling you no but your stomach says yes. Ignore that urge to go. 3. Taste like a half star better version of McDonald's but someone cut your burger in a square and gives smaller ingredients.  4. When I was done eating my friends first reaction was Can we go now? While my reaction was can I eat somewhere else as a do over for this meal.  5. Sad face.   Warning Rant ahead...  The HYPE. First to address the hype before the review. I'm sure 99.9% of the people walking in the door watched Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. I even heard a rumor that a White Castle would be open in Hollywood to promote the movie. False. The closest White Castle to CA at that time was in Chicago but eventually a location came to Las Vegas. The only promise of enjoying a small slider in the frozen form after getting the munchies from a mind altering substance legal in some states was the only way for some people to get a taste. The idea of a fresh burger drew all of us here.  Where is the line?... I freaked out thinking... I hope this place isn't packed during lunchtime on a Friday. There was no line just 1 person taking their time ordering and other employees taking their time filling the order. The food is served in little boxes. My first temptation was to order a lot but I calm myself down and decided to start with the 4 sliders combo (2 cheese, 2 plain and fries). Visually, when I received the items it was disappointing compared to the colorful menu pictures. The slider fills about 2/3 of the box (with a 70% bun to meat ratio) and the rest is just air and paper. If only the boxes were etible I would have more food... think a kids happy meal only smaller.   The ingredients mimic McDonald's. The pickle, cheese, mustard, onions etc without lettuce or tomato. Only the slider patty is seasoned differently and the bread is like a 99 cent store roll. I can see the appeal of eating 30 boxes... I mean sliders but I rather have a 1 pound burger. Also, sliders are served everywhere in standard bar food and even Dennys is a lot better. I sure there is a disclaimer that reads only consume with alcohol and or other possibly illegal subtances.  In California, I am spoiled with the burger options and no In N out is not amazing it's the Honda Civic of burgers there good and reliable but there are better  options.  It's a good thing this place is Las Vegas. I can't speak for the rest of the country but if this is your only option I can understand the love for White Castle but if you've tried other options you will be sadly disappointed. If you want a burger you can hold in 2 hands this is not the place.   The location is not easily accessible since it faces The Strip. If you are not walking around this general area it is a bit of a walk. I don't recommend going as a fast food option on your last day when leaving  Las Vegas. I parked at Venetian and walked past so many great affordable eating places on the way to White Castle. I feel like an idiot now, after the disappointment of my lunch choice.   In conclusion, just don't do it. My mistake was I had Shake Shack the day before and I ignored my brain that warned me about the hype. Fool me once shame on me but fool my twice F U. If you are a fan do whatever floats your boat but if you are trying for the first time just don't go. There is very little room left for improvement. White Castle is for people that enjoy McDonald's but want a smaller snack with food that taste like it came from the frozen section of a grocery store.",

I was expecting delicious small burger sliders with a side of fries for the amount of money I paid. It was horrible. And I don't blame any staff, this iPad to do with the quality of the burger. They basically tasted the same as the microwaveable ones you get at a local food market. Very disappointing. I couldn't even finish the small lil burgers. Would never recommend this franchise to anyone until they find a better supplier for their patties. And stop using microwave food. The fries were ok. The instructions say to \"put mustard on this review\" (and I wish I woulda put some On that horrible burger) but I don't wanna sound like I'm trashing this franchise blatantly, I'm sure there's a few that will appreciate the quality of these small burgers. Good luck White Castle! Hope you get better, being this is our first west coast franchise.    Ps: don't let the movie fool you!",

I had chicken rings which were basically like chicken nuggets with a hole in the middle. The burgers tasted pretty close to the flavor I've experienced with the frozen kind. I don't know if that speaks to White Castle's ability to freeze and recreate in the microwave or what. It's okay.

Advice:  Go in the daytime, buy a sack and put the leftovers in your room fridge for a late night snack.  Oh so good.  You'll thank me at 3am after a night at Omnia.....  Special shout out to the Saturday morning staff (9am - 7/30/16)  Super friendly and fast service.  Kudos!!",

    "text": "So my kids and I, enjoy those famous cheeseburger slider, from White Castle, found in the frozen food section, at your local grocery store.  So getting them fresh off the grill, must be even better.  Before, the only way to go to a White Castle restaurant is driving to the Midwest, which was the closes restaurant to Southern California.    But now, Las Vegas has opened two of them, one on the strip, and one in downtown Vegas.  So visiting a real life White Castle restaurant is now a reality.  So we spent the weekend in Vegas, and visited the one located on the strip.  Typical fastfood atmosphere, with a casino right next door.  Between the four of us, we ate about 30 cheeseburgers, with a half dozen chicken sandwiches, and a half dozen of the fish sandwiches.  Also got an order of french fries, and onion chips.  Fries were just OK, but the onion chips were actually really, really good.  At the begining, we were in heaven, eating them fresh is so much better than the microwave version.  But to make a long story short, we had so many sandwiches, I don't think we'll eat another White Castle cheesburger in a long, long, long time.  I think I was having nightmares, of those sliders attacking me.  So all and all, a great little burger, just take it slow and easy.",

Came back a couple nights later after seeing \"O\" and we ordered the same thing except my girlfriend didn't want onions this time. Got the food and looked at the sliders and there were onions on all of them. Took them back to the front and told them I asked for no onions. The guy responded with \"we don't do no onions, just easy onions\". I told him I was just there two nights prior and got them without onions and I'm allergic so I can't do \"easy onions\"....  Another employee came over at the point. Well she didn't really come over, just kind of turned towards us and yelled \"we can't do no onion so if you're allergic you can't eat here\". I was shocked. How can you tell a customer (who already paid) that they just can't eat there because of one single topping on a slider?   This place is garbage, the employees are garbage. Slogan should be \"have it our way\".",

    "text": "I have been craving white castle for many many years now! There are no locations in California so it was hard to get my hands on a burger. AKA why it took over 20 years to try one. When I spotted the location walking down the strip I veered right in! I had already eaten but I needed to try it. I am always a sucker for sliders. They are cute and mini. You can mix and match them with other types and they are easier to eat when small! I chose a burger slider and one with cheese. Both of them are delicious! If I had to choose one though I would definitly go eith the cheese one. Why you ask? Cheese makes everything better!! I am ready to go back so I can try other versions! Also shocker but I didnt get any french fries. I saw they have loaded fries and it was the hardest thing not to order them. Any one feeling nice enough to buy me a plane ticket to get them?",

This was the first time I had White Castle since then. I was severely disappointed and it's not because I went with the veggie burger this time.   Everything was disgusting. It was a poor excuse for what they are calling a \"burger\" and \"fries\". Their onion fries were their saving grace. It was the best thing we ordered, which was at least edible. My girlfriends had the burger and neither of them finished their meals. Our order took forever because I ordered the veggie. Apparently it takes longer to make? Perhaps it's because it isn't ordered as much as the burgers?   For the 3 of us, we spent a total of $17 which included a beer. This is definitely a cheap eat, and somewhere you'd go if you were drunk and hungry. There's no other reason why you'd \"crave\" this place ever. Save your money and calories and get a real burger from Shake Shack or In n Out Burger.",

Way too many years later, I finally got the chance when we were in Vegas. I don't know why people complain about these or what they are expecting. It's not an In-n-Out. It's a processed, tiny burger, but that's okay! If that's what you're looking for, it's pretty good. get yourself a half dozen and go to town. They're very inexpensive, and you get what you pay for here. I didn't expect gourmet Gordon Ramsey burgers that are $26 for a cheeseburger. I expected a fast food experience, and that's exactly what it is/was. I liked it okay, but I won't be rushing back per say. The service was fine, and the wait wasn't bad. I would say there needs to be more seating, because it's shared with the casino floor, so that was a little unexpected. I would have rather this been sectioned off, so it would be its own stand along place. Basically, if you go in knowing what type of food it is, you're going to be okay. There were some drunk college kids that kept running back and forth from the sports bar to the restaurant acting like morons, so the crowd you deal with is a crap shoot, keep that in mind.",

Nevertheless, we just really wanna stop by and see what the fuzz is all about. The price was fair, $9 for all in that combo. If you think that's high, then why are you in Vegas??

    "text": "Tried White Castle for the first time at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest and thought they were decent. I think there was more hype about how great they were that made me want to give it a try.   When I heard about White Castle opening in Vegas I thought I should try it from the real place instead of a food truck. So I went with a friend opening day. The line wrapped around the building. We waited for about an hour and a half but moved pretty fast considering the line of people. While waiting it was nice to see some of the staff coming out to talk to us and we're so enthusiastic about opening.   When we finally got to the front I had to try one of everything. Almost everything. We got the original sliders , fries, loaded fries and chicken rings. Once we had the food to ourselves we indulged. Loved the chicken rings and who doesn't love fries. The loaded fries tasted good but I could have done without the bacon,sadly it didn't taste like good crispy bacon we all love. Annnnnd then the sliders...they tasted just as I remembered from the foodie fest. Luke warm and wet, almost soggy bread.  I'm an optimist so I do wanna go back and try it again and hope it was only like that due to the craziness of opening day. If not, definitely munchie or drunk food.   P.S. Get a beer! The way they serve it is pretty awesome.",

Once you get into the idea that you're eating something completely different, you're on the road to success.  I fell in love with these little onion-y meat and bun nuggets in Kentucky. I suppose if you hate onions, you'll hate this. The onions are cooked and the patties and buns are stacked on top steaming everything with that onion-y goodness. These were every bit as good as the ones I've had in Kentucky.   Pro Tip: Get a side of onion chips, and order by the sack.",

My only beef with this place - no pun intended, but I could have deleted it and used another phrase if I really wanted to - is that they serve onion chips, which are whole chunks of onion covered in bread crumbs, instead of onion rings, which are built around processed, probably reconstituted onions. It's a nod to quality but I miss the old school rings.  And of course now I want White Castle. The crave is too real.",

I was impressed by the chicken sliders which were made from all white meat chicken. the cheese fries were also very good. all in all, this is the perfect hangover food but I would not consider it \"quality\" food.",

    "text": "White Castle, what are you doing in Vegas? I came here with a goal to try this place. I watched the movie and heard the hype and I pumped up my wife and son about the franchise. The tradition and history was the draw and the curiosity was the nail in the coffin. So our drive to Vegas was filled with goals, must do's, promises, and plans to try White Castle and Nathan's Hot Dogs. We were on a budget because we were staying for a week and we had a football tournament to attend. But White Castle was a must have and we decided on taking a walk from Excalibur to White Castle. It is a 1 hour walk from end to end because the sidewalks are so crowded and a 2 mile hike if you look at a GPS. It was a cold night and we worked up an appetite walking to the location but that did not help the outcome. Finally when we arrived with our faces half frozen we found a place to sit across from all the slot machines. The restaurant is very noisy because it is open on to the game floor. I lined up and saw the huge selection of options and I decided to keep it simple. My order: Original slider and original slider with cheese: They were a total disappointment bland with no seasoning not even a pinch of salt the cheese was flavor less but did add some texture. The onions got lost in the process and added nothing to the flavor. My 11 year old could not even finish one slider and he walked there with no dinner he thought it was gross and said he was scared for life.(preteen drama) I think when three people who enjoy fast food aren't willing to eat the food something is extremely wrong. (Negative rating if possible) Loaded fries: Those were okay and edible but nothing to rave about I would definitely order the wedges from Jack's than these.  Fries: What can I say about prepackaged frozen fries other than they weren't burnt or soggy.   Onion rings: They were good but not worth remembering or craving. Wo when the sides are okay and the burgers suck you get one star that is all there is to it and I don't think if I was in the East coast I would ever go looking for a White Castle or waste my money at one. Oh yeah and the customer service was just okay you can tell the staff was tired and not happy to be there even though it wasn't even 10pm. I though the walk would enhance the experience but it just added to the disappointment so I apologize if I upset White Castle fans with my review.",

Depending on the time of day, you might encounter a line of people waiting outside.  We came here at 6 pm on a Monday evening - a short line of 5 people formed outside; when we left 45 min later, the line was around 20 people outside. Once you're inside, it's another 10-15 people. It took us about 30 min to get our food. Once you place your order, you are given a number, and once your food is ready, they call your number to pick it up. The lady would repeatedly call out the same number for a minute or two until the order was picked up. That certainly didn't add any great ambience to our dining experience.  As of 2/2/15 their menu was not quite extensive as the menu on-line. They don't have fish burgers or onion rings. We tried the original sliders, chicken ring sliders, fries, and onion chips (like onion rings but chopped up). Everything tasted like a 2/5 except for the onion chips which tasted better.",

It's a small steamed burger, and it tastes great. Small sliders that are bite sized is what White Castle is all about. Quick service and overall great place in my mind.  Yes, the prices were high, but drive 1200 more miles if you want the closer one, and you'll pay the higher than normal prices for them there.

Well the taste is no better then what you would get from the grocery store, so might as well stick with that if they are the same plus you don't have to wait in long lines like you do at this place. On the bright side they are pretty inexpensive compared to the other food choices offered on the strip.",

He thought they looked good and he did not want to try the frozen ones as he wanted the authentic experience. They were such a waste of money and calories! We got the 10 pack of hamburgers for $11, and a large fries for $2.95 which would of been the same as getting a number #1 and 2 extras for myself and come out with less food. We waited 30 minutes for our food and when we got it and ate it, we were so unsatisfied with the flavor. IT tasted just like onions, thats it! so overpowering. Will not go back! Do not suggest.",

I think it's just something you have to grow up with as a kid to crave for nostalgia's sake when you're super high. As a grown-up who's never had these before, these were basically worse than McDonald's. They tasted like chemicals and I'm not even sure if it was even real meat. It made me and my girlfriend feel extremely gross after, and I had to walk it off for the rest of the day to feel normal again. Would never ever try this again even if someone paid me to eat it.",

With that said, and with rave reviews of friends and family, my experience here was anti climatic. I'll have to admit that the fresh ones were slightly better than the frozen one you make at home. These famous sliders are steamed on a bed of grilled onions with a very thin slice of hamburger,  (And I mean thin. I suppose so that it could cook faster) and topped with a bun to also steam. If you want cheese, that is extra. Your slider also contains a pickle. If you want double meat that would be extra as well. I had order the cheese slider combo. It came with 4 sliders, fries or onion chips, and a drink. This cost about $9. Prices are a bit high for what you are receiving. That is to be expected considering it is on the Las Vegas Strip. It's always busy and within one of the casino in Vegas.",

If you're on the strip and you have time to wait in line it's worth the wait for a white Castle. And staff did seem really stressed out by the sheer number of people being served. Also price of the burgers are higher there then I've paid elsewhere for a white Castle.",

I can not begin to understand how someone could \"evaluate\" a White Castle as if it was some kind of high end steakhouse.   1. White Castle is NOT an east coast thing. The first White Castle was opened in Wichita Kansas.   2. There are none west of the Mississippi? 31 in Missouri, one in Vegas and 68 in Illinois which sits on the east side of the great river, I say close enough.  Eat them sober, why? A shot of tequila should come with four ingredients, tequila, lime, salt and a Whitie! A twelve pack of beer should be called a twenty pack, twelve beer and eight sliders.  If it was up to me I would add one more option to the menu. Grind up all the west coast Castle bashers, mix them with the beef and call it the west coast Whitie. Go back to your over-rated In and Out burger!",

The onions and grease are key to the entire experience. Without them, you've just got a tiny, boring, dry cheeseburger ... which is what you get here.   I mean, you can see them grilling the food right there, but somehow it comes out tasting almost exactly like the crappy frozen microwave version! You don't taste the onions at all and there's minimal grease to liven up that dry bun.   Dunno if this is typical corporate quality-cutting when something develops a following, or just this particular location not having their stuff together, but this ain't the White Castle people rave about. About as cheap as Strip food gets at 1.30 for regular and 1.60 with cheese, but you might as well just microwave up a six pack if it's gonna be like this ...",

White Castle is one of those late night craving fixers that used to not exist in the western USA, leave it to Vegas to make it happen. This place is a bit of a show in the middle of the night as most people are drunk and sloppy while ordering lol. The food itself is as expected, small but tasty, usually takes 4-5 of these bad boys to get you full. This is likely the only reason to go into the Casino Royale, as it is located within. Overall, recommend as a late night novelty fix, not necessarily if you're looking for a delicious burger.   Pros- Price Beer price Only one in western U.S.  Plenty of seating  Center of the strip  Cons- Average food A bit of a novelty burger  Messy  Cleanliness",

I could probably eat a dozen of these guys. These fries are the best because the wrinkle cut fries has way more crisp because there's a larger surface area for it be fried than a normal straight cut fry. NOW let me tell you about the onion chips. If you like onion rights you will like this because they are just big size fried onion wedges. I would highly recommend this over the fries just because the fries were not as crispy as I would have liked. A great place to grab a snack after all the drinking.",

This location is convenient & clean (right next to Casino Royale, Denny's, Walgreens, near the Venetian) ... but irritating beyond belief in how SLOW they are.  Should not take more than 10 minutes to get your order (& that's not including a slow as molasses line to even place your order because the workers are just not efficient.  Managers should train their staff to be faster than this!!",

And if your fan of the movie(Harold & Kumar) then you must try this place once cause those frozen ones you buy at the grocery store are fake and don't give White Castle anyway justice.   I ordered a combo.  *Sliders with cheese - Without the cheese they slider would suck so the cheese is good and def a must.  *Fries - Crinkle cut and very lacking. Easy pass next time. *Onion Fries - Your combo will be much better if you substitute for these. I like these a lot better.   I would probably recommend on skipping on combos and getting a sack. Because 4 sliders aren't really enough. Anyways White Castle isn't anything special but it is appealing at 4-5 AM, if you don't want Hash House or Earls.   The service is like any fast food joint. I asked for ranch and the lady said she had to go to back and get some. I waited 5 minutes and she didn't move at all. She had the easiest job of handing out sauces and she couldn't even do that smh.",

I wasnt really expecting too much thinking it will taste exactly like the frozen ones, but I thought they were pretty good! I wouldnt say that im obsess with it tho, lol. I would still recommend it if you're in Vegas just to say that you've tried it. Lol.",

The bread is warmed on a bed of onions and they can only scrape it off, so it still thoroughly tastes like onions no matter what. The meat is not a good color and is so thin. The only thing that saved it for me were the chicken rings and chicken slider. We had In-N-Out the first day and this comes nowhere close to the quality and freshness, especially since they are just about the same price. Don't bother.",

But you will be able to see the White Castle sign.   When we got there the lines were not as busy like we hoped it would be. It took me a long time to come just because the hype made it impossible to come. Thank god we waited though.  We ordered 20 like cheeseburgers sliders. They also has beer for you beer drinkers. They are like I expected little tiny cheeseburgers with 1 pickle Alice and some onions. For some reason it did taste good. But it taste like how the frozen one would taste at a grocery store.   Although those sliders were tiny I did get start to get full off 3.   I probably won't be returning here unless one of my tourist family members want to try it out. It wasn't a horrible experience I just feel like there's nothing special about White Castle. Maybe it's better on the East Coast!",

You can order combos or the items separately. I got the jalapeno burger with white cheese pickles and onions, a cheeseburger, and the loaded fries. I felt that the burgers tasted subpar at best and for sure I've had better. But if you're getting fast food style sliders these will somewhat hit the spot. The fries were a bit salty for me so I'm not really a fan.  Don't forget to get condiments. They don't provide them to you so you have to ask for it. I would recommend the Dusseldorf mustard. To me it's a bit spicier than regular mustard.  Also they have \"swag\" aka souvenirs that you can purchase and if you like beer they do have alcohol at this location.  TL;DR Don't expect fancy ass burgers for a fast food slider place. Keep in mind these guys have to make even 100 sliders for just one or many orders. Also it is a bit pricy here so order wisely.",

After that, I noticed that you could buy them frozen in the supermarket and defrost them to get a fix. When I heard an actual location opened up in Vegas, I made it a point to get there eventually. It took me 3 trips to Vegas to finally go because I was scared away by the potential crowds.  Well, it finally happened. It's located on the outskirts of Casino Royale on the strip, really easy to find by foot.  I came on a Wednesday around 11 am. There was a very short line but the seating area was pretty full. I asked the cashier when it starts getting crazy, and she told me after noon. A hot tip for you guys, earlier is better. The service was great, and the seating area was clean.  I ordered ten sliders with cheese, onion rings, and fries. The fried stuff was meh but the sliders were delicious. Meat, cheese, onion, and a soft roll. They taste better than the frozen ones because they're cooked fresh. The difference isn't that noticeable though.   Verdict: I love their sliders. I don't care that they're mostly bread with very little meat. I'm not coming here to be healthy.   Note: They have cheesecake on a stick. I regret not getting it. They also sell beer.",

Not only do they seem to hate their jobs, they seem to hate life. No matter how polite you are to them, how much you smile, they are rude and unpleasant.   Dirty. As in disgusting. Food on floor. Smeared food on tables. Sticky, dirty floor in front of the soda machines. Just very unsanitary look and feel.   Dried nasty onions on the sliders. These things must have been scraped off of a counter. Inedible. Tossed those two directly into the trash. And I didn't dare approach the counter with the issue... As unpleasant as they were, who knows what they would have done to my food. As it was, I did get sick that night. About an hour and a half after eating there. First time I have EVER been sick from eating at ANY White Castle!  The sad part is I was there a year before... Almost to the date. What a HUGE difference. My first trip, it was clean. Staff was friendly. Food was great. I was so looking forward to my return trip to Vegas, and even planned with several friends to ditch the high end eateries at the Venetian/Palazzo, and go on a 'Crave' run. But in one year this location did a 180 and turned into a garbage bin.   Owners/Management please step up and do something to turn it around. Please. I beg you. If you don't, I fear you won't be around next year when I'm back in town, or the Board of Health will button you up. Yes, it was that bad.   Is it too much to ask to have a clean place to eat? With a semi friendly staff? And food that doesn't make you sick soon after eating it?",

    "text": "Meh... The presence of White Castle in movies, social media and your grocers frozen food aisle planted the seed of curiosity. I just had to know what the excitement was all about. Stories of four hour waits and the Strip White Castle selling out of sliders back on January 29, 2015 during opening day, burgeoned the curiosity. Was it a craving? No interest in standing in lines so no special trip to find and pay for nearby parking to give it a go. However, when friends are staying at the Wynn, it's your day off and you're parking free at the Palazzo you cruise the Strip. It's been a day of Popping Boba, Lobster Tails, lunch salad and after a couple hours of penny slots, we decided to drop some coin in the Casino Royal.   My friend and I noticed White Castle. First impressions of the establishment were not impressive. It looked poorly maintained, trash bins full, tables needed wiping and bussing. Neither she nor I had ever had a White Castle slider so we ordered one each. $1.49 a pop! For this 2 inch by 2 inch burger with a 1/4 teaspoon of grilled onion and a pickle slice??? The patty is less than an ounce at  .89 ounces... the Micky D $1 menu burger you get a 1.9 ounce burger patty.   The Staff was nice and the sliders came quickly. I opened the slider to take a peek. It looked grey, wet and unappetizing but we pressed on. White Castle has been in business since 1921. They have something going on.   The bite...the bun was soft with a shiny exterior, somewhat appealing to the senses. The bun was fresh and had a sweetness kind of in that Hawaiian bun kind of way. There was the savory onion and the subtle beef flavor without the bite and texture I like when eating a burger.   All in all, been there, done that but won't be back. Not for me but please note it's not about me. Some folks can't stand cilantro but I love it. Also note that you can but a stack of 100 sliders for $115; this location sold three the day before.   Tomato, tomahto...",

Because we didn't have any in Arizona me & my brother & some friends made a spontaneous trip to Vegas just for White Castle! Yes it's True, that's how much we love it!   Best cheeseburger sliders! Make sure you ask for cheese on your sliders, taste so much better. They even have a case for 30 sliders & 100 sliders!   We also tried their onion chips which is suppose to be onion rings but they look like fish. It's cut up but still good.   The sliders are so small you can eat about 4-6 of them depends how hungry you are.   Also you might have to buy extra fries or drinks cause some of the meals don't come with enough, example the 20 pack comes with only 2 fries but I had to buy 3 extra fries cause 5 people were sharing. But 2 extra fries would have been enough.",

However, it didn't turn out the way we had hoped. The staff are slow and the thin, grey colored burger didn't have any taste. And the burger sauce? What is that??   While we were eating a lady who worked there hovered around us during our entire meal. I assumed she was the custodian of the restaurant, but it was creepy and annoying.  I am as disappointed as anyone that we didn't like it :-(",

I'm glad I got to finally experience white castle after everything I've heard and seen, but that will probably be the last time I ever go... It's just not for me, My boyfriend loves it here.",

But it wasn't the wait to order that was awful, it was the wait to get your order. The staff could not handle it and the girl in charge of noting which orders were coming out could not keep up. She was putting out orders to be handed out without telling the guy which order it was. Luckily another girl came over and took control, sending the other girl back to the prep line.   When we finally got our order 30 MINUTES LATER, super disappointing. The burgers tasted exactly like the ones you can get in the frozen section of your local grocery store. The only difference-A fresh bun (not soggy like when they come out of the microwave).  Guess I won't ever have to make the trek back here or stand in line. I'll get mine from the freezer.",

I have never been to White Castle before and have wanted to since the moment I watched those movies. For some reason I only recently found out there was a White Castle in Vegas so the next time I went, I had to try it out.   This place is open 24/7 and is next to a casino so it's loud. You'll see a lot of interesting and drunk characters (like we did). There will be a long line no matter what. It's just how it is. Also, you can order beer here (as if you thought you could run away from that in Vegas).  We ordered three original sliders, three cheese sliders, onion chips, and french fries. If you are like me and can't tell how big the sliders are, I finished one slider in 4-5 bites. The onion chips are decent; they're just onion rings in chip form. I'm not a fan of crinkle cut fries so I thought the fries were okay.  This place is the place to go when you're hungry and need some comfort food to munch on and settle in your stomach before you pass out in your bed.",

We got the meal that comes with 10 cheeseburgers and two fries. It's the appropriate amount of food for two people. We even had some left overs.

It's the only place that I've been able to find them so that was great, but the only issue for me is the staff here is rude, and slow. My friend and I ordered 2 orders of mozzarella sticks and have been waiting 15 minutes for them and it's not even busy here. I walked up to a worker and asked if he called our number yet because we had been waiting a very long time for a small order. He responded with a nasty look and said \"you've only been waiting 12 minutes\".  Not for nothing but there's 15 people working behind the counter and max 10 customers ordering food. I'm really disappointed in the pace and attitude of this staff. Idc how strong my craving for mozzarella sticks is on this vacation, I definitely will not be back.",

Expect two to four more security guards in the tiny, cramped dining establishment.  That is not intimidating at all.    The GF and I ordered a slider and fries.  I saw them putting pickles on the slider and knew this would be a no go for her.  Sadly, the cashier had already rung us up.  It took an awkward 2-3 minutes for him to refund and re-swipe my credit card.  Sure, it is my fault for making him go through all that trouble. But, could he not have simply told the person making the sliders to not add pickles?    A minute or two after being witness to sheer incompetence, our number is called.  I guess in all the confusion, they forgot to put fries in the bag (even though I was charged for it).    Despite being the only one in line to order, I feel this place can be described as chaotic.  There were so many employees at work.  There must have been hundreds of sliders already pre-cooked and just hanging out, waiting for someone to buy them.  Freshness is definitely not a high concern amongst them.    Now on to the actual taste of the slider and fries.  The slider was nothing special.  It tastes like an exact replica of the microwavable ones.  The fries were average at best.  They taste so plain, and crispiness is word miles away from the texture of them.    Yelpers, you have been warned.  Proceed at your own risk.  If you are drunk, by all means, you will absolutely love it here.  If you have standards, please head to our friend Ronald.",

You can get a way better burger for cheaper at Shack Shake, Steak N Shake, Fatburger, or even McDonalds, if you want a late night meal, Del Taco is better than White Castle. I think people rate it in the nostalgia feeling and the memories, because it's totally not worth it.  The line did move fast and it was clean, but based on taste, no way. You're in Vegas, were you can get a gourmet burger for $6.99  (at Flemings Steakhouse)  or a decent burger at local bars for the same price.",

    "text": "I was extremely excited when I found out White Castle came to vegas. I remember eating those ones you get in the freezer section at the grocery store. The burgers at White Castle taste exactly like the ones in the frozen section. I am very disappointed.   First of all, every worker here looks miserable. Does anybody know how to smile? Say thank you? Don't you work in customer service? I've worked in food and beverage and customer service for a long time and I know that your job can be stressful or whatever but at least look up at me and look like you care. I feel this place could benefit from the manager monitoring everyone. Anyway,  I order original cheese sliders and jalapeno cheese sliders. I am awaiting for my number to be called then loudly and obnoxiously on the intercom I hear mine. I'm pretty excited still. I go up to get my food and then ask for ketchup. The lady goes to grab ketchup and hands it to me without saying anything. Then I ask for ranch. She looks irritated and then goes and grabs me ranch. I also asked for mayo then she finally looked up at me, kind of rolled her eyes, grabs that even more frustrated and hands it over. She never said one word to me.  The burgers... were okay. I open the bun and the cheese is not melted. In some of them they were partially melted. But man.. at least throw it in the toaster oven or microwave or something. I hate cold cheese.   It doesn't look like I'll be coming back. I can just go to the store, buy the freezer ones and warm those up.",

The chicken rings taste a bit like breaded shoe leather, definitely don't bother ordering those.  There can be a a significant wait to get your order, and the dining area is suffused with a quiet, desperate sadness, so if there are no available tables, go get (a lot) of drinks elsewhere and try again later.",

Cheeseburger over regular burger and you need to eat at least 3 of those to compare to eating one burger since it's so small.  Get regular fries and onion rings... they both go well with the burger. They also have beer on tap.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Hellooooooo White Castle! I've been waiting for you to come to the West Coast (or as close as can be to the West Coast) since the Harold and Kumar movie. Yes, it's been THAT long. -_- And those White Castle sliders in the frozen aisle of the grocery store do not do it justice! Located in the Best Western Casino Royale, in between Venetian and Harrah's, they're open 24/7, perfect for late night munchies and as expected for a Vegas spot! There's a direct entrance off the strip so you don't have to go through the casino floor. The direct entrance takes you through the dining area first while you make your way back to the counter to queue up and order.   BF went all out for 2 people and got the #9 combo pack, which includes 20 original sliders and 2 orders of french fries. Just 10 sliders short of a crave case cardboard box, which meant our order was packed slightly discreetly in a paper bag with a plastic bag instead. LoL. Sliders come with bun, patty, pickle, and onions. Cheese is an extra $6 (about 33 cents per slider) for the #9 combo and was well worth it! I bit into the slider with low expectations because I've been searching for them for so long and I didn't want to hype up the slider only to be disappointed. I wasn't. Flavorful and all gone in 4 bites (2 for the BF). Enough flavor on its own. You can also politely ask for some sauce (meant for dipping chicken tenders but oh well). I used ranch, BBQ and zesty zing on some of the sliders. Even though we ordered and took it to go, and made the 15 minute trek back to our hotel room to enjoy, the burgers were slightly damp, but still good!   How successful were we in finishing the entire order? Maybe 70% of the way through. We dusted off all the fries and had only some sliders left. The remaining 30% was an excellent breakfast/lunch (not brunch since it was a weekday) meal!",

    "text": "Ok so for those of us who have never ever had a White Castle from an actual \"White Castles\" I was so freaking stoked about my visit to this holy grail. I truly believe I had the  exact same feeling that Harold and Kumar had when they finally arrive at the place where they have been dying to get to all because they have been yearning for those little magical sliders in the pretty little white box.  As I stepped through the double glass door from the Las Vegas strip and entered this gold mine I was filled with happiness. Who would have ever thought that we would be so lucky to have a White Castle here, but I guess dreams do come True.  The line was not bad and space was pretty small and yes they only have 2 cash register but there was an army of workers in the back cranking out them sliders and the food came out fast. As I am placing my order I am still in disbelief that I didn't have to travel to the east coast to experience this must try burger joint. Any how that was just it. I am giving them a 4 stars because although everything was great the burger itself the one thing that this place is all so famous for was good but I wish was better by being hot and fresh.   I totally understand that in order to meet demands and keep customers happy by getting their food quick they must constantly pump out burgers and let them sit there, and that's where it suffers I think. I burgers itself was a little cold. But never the less I was extremely content. I ordered almost every item on the menu because even though I wish it was a hope skip and a jump, it is not easy for us locals to just drive up and pick us up a bag full of burgers...no you must be strategic about it and actually plan your day to enjoy this place and it's food.   All in all everything was good and I defiantly will be back again and again. I'm crossing my fingers they will open up other locations where we can just pull up to a drive thru and satisfy our cravings a little easier. I think I have been building up the anticipation about White Castles since the movie Harold and Kumar and never thought I would ever get to taste them or get to one without actually leaving Vegas but now I can. So say what you want about this place I am just so happy that after all these years I Finally Made it to WHITE CASTLES!!!! Thank you for opening one up in Vegas.   Oh and the staff was super nice too!!!  ***OOPS I PUT THIS PLACE IS DRESSY BUT I MEANT CASULE*** I hope we all could figure that out! LOL",

I almost cried. I can officially say, I tried it! I think everyone should experience \"the hype\" and live up to that movie. Some will drive hours away for this, some will just walk from their hotel and devour it. I say, great experience! Pretty quick service too. I didn't order but it was fast haha!

Yes the prices were higher as if you were to go back to the mid west. However you have to take into count that. Mid west is cheaper. This is Las Vegas. And also it's the strip everything on the strip is priced higher. So can't complain. Def worth waiting in line for!!",

I'm not a big girl, but I swear I could have killed like 20 burgers (eh hem, really they're SLIDERS) if our group didn't already have reservations for Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse. I was there for Superbowl and this location had just opened so the wait was pretty ridiculous over the weekend but we waited in line in the late afternoon so our wait wasn't as bad.

    "text": "White Castle goes one of two ways typically.  People are either fanatics or hate it.  Personally, I fall in the former category.  Their fries are delicious, the sliders are unique, offering a steamed variation on the burger.  And the toppings are minimal yet effective.  For the first time, I got a chicken ring sliders which was pretty good and seemed to offer a sizable piece of chicken.  In N' Out may be a little better, but White Castle is great as well.  Having the closest location to Los Angeles, I stopped at the Vegas White Castle for a Crave Case.  I went for the Cheeseburger Sliders, which run about $41 for a case of 30.  Although I remember them having ketchup, when I asked for them to hold the ketchup, I was informed they came without ketchup, but did have pickles which I did not remember.  These ones were not quite as steamed or good as some of the east coast locations, but hey, I'm eating White Castle so who am I to complain?!  I'm not sure that the pickles were needed and as they sit in my freezer while I work my way through the case, I may regret getting a smaller order and going for the frozen ones at home, but so far I have yet to be too disappointed.  And if anything the mental appeal and novelty of having an authentic White Castle experience awaiting in my freezer will help give it an edge.",

Yeah, the meat is a super-thin mystery but it's a nostalgia thing, there's nothing like the WC flavor. Summers in Ohio with my cousins would always end with a trip here. Back home in Texas, my dad would crave them and have to settle for the frozen-aisle version.   Finally, Vegas got an outpost! The prices are jacked up for the Strip location but the taste is all 1994. It really is a trip to finally be able to taste real White Castle burgers again: hot, fresh, crusted in onion bits and topped with a single pickle. You gotta get them with cheese for the full effect. Add ketchup at your own risk!  Service is pretty organized: the kitchen is open and everyone is working hard, order numbers are both called out and posted on a screen. Somehow I got skipped, but they remade my order and tossed in dessert, too.",

The closest thing to these little sliders in SoCal are in the frozen foods aisle of the grocery store.  I got loaded fries and a slider. 1 slider because I didn't know if they were going to be giant sliders or tiny ones. The fries were crispy and definitely loaded. The slider was good but not enough so I got another one. They're like the size of a post-it.  If you're comparing White Castle sliders to premium hamburgers then that's not a fair fight, White Castle goes into a category all on its own of fast food sliders. The employees are all really friendly. The food is good and soaks up all the alcohol you've been drinking.",

    "text": "The Veggie Sliders are baaaack!! (They are vegan with the Sweet Thai sauce, or ketchup, of course.)   I'm from the midwest, where White Castles are part of the urban culture and everyone has a story or two to tell about a WC experience.  When I gave up beef in high school, I would eat the chicken rings and fish sandwiches/nibblers. After giving up all meat, I was left with french fries. However, I moved to AZ a few years ago and I swear, as soon as I moved, they introduced the veggie sliders. Unfortunately, there were no White Castles west of my hometown at the time. Then came the opening of this Vegas location in 2015. I was ecstatic!   I drove to Vegas, went straight to this White Castle, and glazed in amazement as I saw that they sold the Veggie Sliders. Once I reached the cashier to order the Veggie Sliders I was advised that they stopped selling them.  I cannot express the levels of 1st world sadness that came over me. I sulked into the background as the rest of my family joyously ordered cheese fries and chicken rings with extra honey mustard.   We returned a few months later so family and friends could get their fix and lo and behold, the veggie sliders were back!! Security cameras may or may not show me dancing around in front of the register.   The veggie sliders are a Dr. Praeger creation, made with veggies (carrots, broccoli, spinach, etc.) instead of soy.  Do not compare them to the original sliders (although, if they teamed up with Beyond Meat or Gardein, they could replicate those); you will only be disappointed.  These sliders are vegan (including the bun), and the Sweet Thai sauce option is also vegan. Some veg*ns do not like them; I love them!  I love being able to eat a full meal at the same place that my non-veg family eats. And I don't care if they are \"healthy\" or not (they may be). You don't go to White Castle for healthy meals; you go for the junk food!  This Vegas location stays packed, particularly later in the evenings.  I've had success in beating the crowds by going earlier in the day, before noon.  The employees are constantly cleaning the dining area, so it tends to stay clean and well stocked.  The drinks are self-serve here, unlike other WCs, which took away my joy of asking for a \"mix\" (which only White Castle OGs will understand).    The prices at this location are jacked up, up to 50% or more on some items (e.g. The Veggie Sliders cost .99 back home; they cost $1.79 here! Milkshakes are nearly $6!!).  Also, this may very well be the only White Castle in existence that doesn't have a drive-thru, so come prepared to go inside. And definitely walk, not drive, as parking is almost non-existent along the strip.  Aside from my complaints, the fact that after nearly a century there is finally a White Castle west of the Mississippi, it's open 24/7, and they have the veggie sliders, AND it's a short road trip for me, is a win-win.",

The sliders were also nowhere near what was expected after eating them so many times in the Midwest in the past.  The buns were all soggy, and even though they are small and square they managed to entirely miss putting them together straight. How did they fix that? Oh, just stuff them in the box and crush them!  There was also only a couple of tables in use, but every other table was absolutely filthy with trash, spilled soda, condiments. I'll save any future White Castle urges for trips to the Midwest.",

Ordered items: Combo #2 which came with 4 cheese sliders, some fries and a drink. The burgers were nothing special. They were good, but I will definitely not go out of my way to get these burgers. I would say 4 sliders are equivalent to 1 full size burger.   I was told this place is the east coasts in-N- out. In my opinion, it doesn't come close. The concept is interesting with the sliders, but the overall quality of the burger Isn't great.   Overall, it was an interesting experience. The line was too long and the burgers were average. I would recommend you only try if the line are short and you're very hungry.",

This small shop is located next to the Harrah's on the east side of a small casino. As you may already know, parking on the strip (if you are coming from off the strip) is a pain in the butt, but if you are coming just to have White Castle I would choose a hotel/casino near the Harrah's.  The restaurant is pretty small and narrow. Once you walk in there are a few tables including one really long table with seats on both sides of the table. The counter is in the back of the restaurant. The menu is pretty basic; there are a few combos that include the sliders, fries and a drink, sliders that are being sold by themselves and also options to order large amounts of sliders!   We ordered a regular combo, but added a few more sliders to our order. They came out quick and hot... and they tasted just like I imagined a fresh White Castle Slider would taste like... my childhood nostalgia. I easily packed away like 7 sliders without blinking, but boy do you pay for it later.  I have friends that have visited the Midwest and told me that White Castle was delicious, but gives you gnarly gas... and boy does it! You have been warned.",

The cheeseburger sliders were slightly better,  but still need improvement.   Don't waste your money here,  you'll regret it!  For $20+ , it should've been alot better! I'm surprised they are still open.   Employees are bitter and unhappy.   Needs some great improvement all around!",

Hey, we don't have a White Castle in Arizona and I have wanted to try an actual White Castle forever.  Even before I saw Harold & Kumar, I enjoyed their frozen sliders growing up.  Eating the real deal after all this time, even after a great German lunch, was heaven.  It could also be because I was under-dressed for the surprisingly cold Vegas weather but the warmth of a cheese slider was bliss.  I loved every dang bite and I don't care what y'all say.  We ordered a 10-slider, fries, onion rings, and two drinks combo.  We got five regular hamburgers and five cheeseburgers just to see the difference.  I was trying to tell Mike W. that cheese makes everything better but he didn't listen and I ended up having to choke down some plain burgers while he enjoyed my delicious cheeseburgers.  The fries were meh but those onion rings were pretty legit.    All in all, I wouldn't mind stopping in for a quick cheap bite when I'm on The Strip.  Is it the best burger ever?  Haha, of course not.  This is a fast food place, obvi.  But I definitely wouldn't say no to going over to White Castle for a quick bite!  Note: Don't get the fish slider. It's super dry!",

    "text": "I give them 3 stars because the food is to my liking; however, there are a few things that I don't like about this place... 1). You have to park at a hotel and walk through the casino to get out to the strip to do some more walking just to get to the place. (walking I don't mind so much, good exercise - trying to keep a positive mindset especially if you're eating junk food lol) 2). When you do finally get there, you have to wait in line and depending on when the tables are cleared/available and how many people you have with you (besides how packed they are) will determine how long you wait until you get inside - only to have to wait in another line to order your food. 3). They dont have an extras section on the menu - for example if you want to add an extra slider to your combo.  4). If you're sitting by the door of the entrance to the place, during the Volcano show at the Mirage hotel across the street, you can feel the heat blowing at you when the door is open. (Im not a fan of heat; and yes Im aware I live in Vegas lol) ***Lastly, I hope they open more locations so for some of us locals who tend to avoid the strip wont have to go to there. As good as the food was, the traffic on the strip, parking at the hotel, and dealing with all the tourists is enough to keep me away.",

We got the Original Slider Combo and the Cheese Slider Combo. Each came with 4 slider burgers, regular crinkle cut fries, and a drink. The best way I can describe the taste is that it reminded me of microwaved cafeteria burgers from elementary school. The sliders weren't hot or cold. The meat, cheese, and onions all lacked flavor. The fries weren't any better. It would've been better with some more salt.   Despite the fact that it's 24/7 and restaurant shares space with a casino, it was surprisingly clean and tidy. We don't understand the cult like following for these sliders and it's not worth the hype. If you're looking for a novelty burger, go to In-n-Out down the strip instead.",

    "text": "I decided to try White Castle for the first time, since this 24/7 location is near the hotel that I was staying at. I bought their cheese slider combo, their breakfast combo, cheese fries, and one chicken slider just to give it a try. Although, I ended up trying their regular slider the next day, since my friends ended up getting some White Castle too.  The cheese sliders are definitely better than the regular sliders. The bread is very soft, but the beef tasted kinda cheap and eh. I personally liked the chicken slider more than the regular cheese slider, but I'm sure most people like the regular cheese slider more. I thought the cheese fries were just okay. I actually like crinkle-cut fries, but these fries were nothing special. The fries are pretty similar in taste with Del Taco crinkle-cut fries. I thought the prices for combos were okay, it was something like $8 or $9 for 4 cheese sliders, fries, and a drink. Maybe it's technically pricey, considering sliders could be finished in a couple bites. But I thought the prices were okay.   Overall, like many, I think we all want to try White Castle because of the Harold & Kumar movie. Or maybe, you tried their sliders in a grocery store, and want to try the real thing. But unfortunately, I think White Castle is very mediocre. I think I could get better chicken slider from Chick Fil A, better fries elsewhere, and better regular sliders or just a better burger/sandwich in general at other fast food establishments. Would I go again? Probably wouldn't go out of my way to get it, but I'd eat it if given to me. There's just so many other better fast food restaurants on the strip, that it doesn't really make much sense to pick White Castle over them.",

Harold and Kumar really hyped this up for me.  Maybe this was a Vegas thing or maybe I need to eat it on the East Coast.    People were also ordering it by the pack so that might have added to the hype.  There was plenty of indoor seating.  I would recommend trying it if you haven't but I won't be getting White Castle from the strip again.",

I personally love sliders so i opted for the 4 sliders, fries and a drink combo. I know i am going to catch some flack , but to me they didn't wow. I don't know if it's a coastal thing like west coast, CA folks and In N Out. Anywho they were just on the bland side, perhaps that was my main gripe. After all the hype it was a bit of a let down. However we were all able to dine on the cheap and get back to the concert in time for some good tunes.",

Each time I asked, the person handing out the food would promptly dismiss me, and even the manager bluntly and rudely told me they serve hundreds of burgers a day, and it would come out soon enough.   Also note - my order number was 374, but they kept on calling order 274 out. I asked if they perhaps had my order ready, but they told me no, they had Order 274 ready, and that it was not my order.  Now, about 1.5 hours after entering the restaurant, and an hour after placing my order, I demanded that they finally look inside the bag, and the manager who had been extremely rude finally conceded that they had mislabeled my order.  Instead of offering anything to help make it better, they only offered me a brownie, which means that they valued wasting about an extra hour of my time at ~2 dollars.  If they had merely checked the queue the first time I asked, no problems would have occurred, and we could have resolved all the issues. Instead, this Whitecastle decides to run as if the customer is always wrong, and will stonewall and lie to you about your order.  Once a mistake is also made, they will make a measly effort to fix their problems.  I strongly recommend you go elsewhere for a burger fix in Vegas.",

Harold and Kumar can finally get their fix in Sin City. While the location in Best Western Hotel is a little bit awkward, it's also quite convenient being that there is parking in the back. I came here in the morning before heading back out to Los Angeles. The staff was in full force and looked like they were ready for a big crowd to come through. I might have been one of the first people to walk in that day so my order was very quick considering that I ordered a crave case.",

    "text": "We're from San Diego, so my boyfriend was eager to eat White Castle that wasn't out of a food truck----it tasted the same lol. I wasn't impressed because a burger can only go so far with flavor, especially White Castle's concept with simple sliders with just meat, buns, optional cheese, onions and pickles. But they're still good and easy to eat. They're also fun to eat. Their food is a cute portion, which allows you to order more of them, or just sticking to a nice small portion that we should be eating haha.   Taste-wise: their burgers honestly taste like McDonald's dollar cheeseburgers to me, BUT BETTER. I stress the better because i'm comparing them to McDonald's. White Castle has better buns, better meat, and better sides for sure. Their onion chips are my faaaaavorite. The chicken rings are okay, dry if anything but a good change if you want chicken as your side. And their french fries remind me of cafeteria fries, and i like cafeteria food.   White Castle is cheap, which is a plus. They aren't trying to sell gourmet food so don't expect gourmet burgers. They're just simple, small, and not bad at all. I can see White Castle doing very well in SoCal and be highly competitive with all of SoCal's other burger joints, seriously. It would be a nice addition to fast food joints i can choose from.   I'm just deducting one star because their food isn't anything out of the ordinary (what do you expect with fast food though?)--but i'm sure that wasn't their goal to begin with, sober at least.",

The line looked really long, but we were only in line for about 10-15 minutes and then it took maybe another 5 to get the actual food.  So here's the deal. My husband and I have lived in So-Cal all our lives, so even though we've always heard of White Castle---the East Coast version of In n Out, we had never gotten to try it. We were SUPER excited when we randomly saw they had one in Vegas that we had to stop and try it! Yay!  We had seen the frozen ones at Ralphs for years, but didn't ever want to ruin our first experience for when we did eventually get to try the real thing....in hindsight I feel like the frozen ones might actually be better!  We weren't very hungry so we just ordered 2 cheese sliders and 1 double cheese slider with no onions for me. PROTIP: Yes you can order individually even though they aren't on the menu that way.  We were lucky enough to instantly find a table (it was packed), sat down, and dug in. Upon first bite we both looked at each other with a WTF look on our faces. We had waited years to try this? Avoided the frozen version? Waited in line. Ew.  The buns were soggy and wet, the meat was gray. Not a good combination. Like I said we didn't spit them out, so I guess it gets a 2 star, but OMG they were pretty close to terrible.   This is what all the hype is about? I admit I think they're cute in those little boxes, but the compliments pretty much end there.   I think I figured it out though...you must have to be high riding on white tigers like Harold and Kumar to be able to say you enjoyed those things.  Thanks but no thanks White Castle...ew.  In N Out for the win....West Coast 4eva!",

I found myself on the strip at 5:45 am, less than 16 hours after the grand opening and judging by the line I figured this may be my only shot to ever eat here.   Even at 6 am it was pretty packed. I only ordered 2 sliders and onion chips and waited for my food. And waited for my food. And...  See, the issue is, there's always going to be some yahoos getting a crave case or a crave crate (100) that is going to hold up the line. I also saw people getting their food before me that ordered after me, and my order was quite small.   Pros:   It tastes exactly like the White Castle you have grown to love.   Cons:  The price is a bit higher than your typical standalone WC.   The wait is always going to be outrageous.   The back of the house is absolutely filthy. Like, worse than Waffle House.   If you've got the time, and you want some White Castle, have at it. I'm not sure I'll be back.   Three *** - Only because I knew what I was getting into.",

Orders are placed at the counter and your number is called when the order is ready for pick up. At the time of my visit the order line moved slowly because only 1 of 3 registers were open. The order was filled quickly even before I reached my table.   Being from Chicago what can you say about White Castle other than \"It's an Institution\". But in Las Vegas it becomes another choice in the growing Burger business. Glad they are here because fresh is better than frozen and I won't have to satisfy the crave when visiting Chicago. Buy them by the sack.   One difference here is that they do not have onion rings. They have onion chips. These are basically rings that have been cut into pieces. Just as good as the rings. Just place several on the slider.",

    "text": "White Castle is just another east coast burger joint that doesn't quite do it for me. My boyfriend and I came around 11 PM after watching a show since we knew the wait during the day would just be ridiculous. Thankfully we were right and the line was pretty short (25 mins) compared to what other people experienced. The line starts outside on the sidewalk and is pretty well manned and serviced by security guys.   On to the food. I wasn't that hungry but my boyfriend decided to \"Buy 'em by the sack\" since this is probably the last time we would be coming here unless we were super drunk and stumbled down this way again. The menu says 10 original sliders but they will put cheese on as many of them as you like which costs you a bit extra. We also got extra grilled onions (which can be added for free). The crinkle cut fries were good but don't think they were any different than ones you get from other fast food joints (just a bit more soggy). The sliders with the cheese were definitely better. They may not seem that big but you can tell you are just putting a whole load of grease down into your stomach.  Onto the aftermath of eating those sliders...man what are those things actually made of! The next morning I was soooooo gassy! So I'm not sure what those tiny little meat patties are made of or how much oil and grease is used to make the burger but man that was noooot pleasant. All in all I probably won't be coming back anytime soon, at least not sober. It's definitely a place to try just because of it's notoriety from the east coast but don't wait in line if it's over 30 minutes! You will be disappointed!",

    "text": "I had my first experience with the White Castle (WC) food truck at the Great American Foodie Fest held in San Diego. I always heard of the business--known for their sliders--and was always interested in tasting one of their products. I guess I just assumed that WC was like the McDonald's of the East Coast, and I wanted to see what it was about those sliders that made them so great (especially after seeing the White Castle excerpt from \"Harold and Kumar\").   There were pre-organized queues and a HUGE WC tent, so I'm sure the vendor expected mile-long lines. However, when we went on the first night the foodie fair was open, there was NO line; only a few people were in front of us so we didn't have to wait long to order and get our grub.   Final verdict: After all that hype, I think I was slightly underwhelmed by those sliders. Maybe it's just because I was different from what I was expecting. Was I glad I tried them? Yes, definitely. Would I crave them late at night? Not so much ... if I were craving fast food late at night, I would probably go for Five Guys fries (soooo addictive) or anything from Del Taco or Chick-Fil-A.   But here's what my friend and I got, as well as what I would try next time if I ever visited a WC again:   \"Cheese Sliders\": These sliders vary slightly from the \"Original\" because they include a slide of American cheese. I need cheese in my burgers ... since I take out the tomatoes and pickles, I can't really just have a slider with the burger alone. My friend and I got 2 for $3 (at least these buggers were cheap), and we saw them being mass produced--in that the thin patties were on the grill in multiples and the workers were putting everything together in True assembly-line fashion. The bun was soft and tasted fresh, which was a plus, but the patty--is that what you even call it?--was super thin ... so thin that I could hardly even taste it. It reminded me of a super thin slice of Spam. I liked the fact that the slider was really light--didn't feel heavy and bloated after eating it--but it definitely needed that cheese. I guess I was expecting the slider to be addicting/have some kind of addictive taste since it got so much hype, but that factor was lacking for me. I'm glad for the experience, but I would probably order something different next time. (Seriously, I don't know how people order packs and packs of these).   \"Bacon & Cheddar Grilled Chicken\": I would actually be interested in trying this slider because it has more elements that I like. This medley features savory grilled chicken with a zesty cheddar-cheese sauce and smoky-bacon crumbles. I do like cheese and bacon, so maybe this slider will be slightly more tasty that the \"Cheese Slider\" that I had.   \"Western BBQ Grilled Chicken\": I love BBQ flavors so this slider sounds like it's right up my alley. It features a savory, grilled chicken slider topped with smoky BBQ sauce and crispy onion rings. I do like BBQ-inspired sandwiches, so I'm down to try this slider one day.   \"Fish Sliders\": I've had fish sliders before that I really liked, so I'm willing to give the WC version a go. It features two fish sliders made with Alaska Pollock and topped with American cheese. You can even upgrade to a combo and add small fries and a soft drink. I'm not the hugest fan of soft drinks, but I would want to add fries to my order ... this is sort of like fish 'n chips, after all, but in slider form.   \"Loaded Fries\": I'm a huge fan of loaded fries, and since the WC version features fries topped with creamy ranch dressing and hickory-smoked bacon crumbles, I'd definitely want to order them some day.   \"Brownie on a Stick\": This dessert sounds really cute and seems to be a great mini indulgence. This treat on a stick features a chocolate brownie dipped in a rich, fudge coating. Brownies are one of my favorite snacks, and everything just tastes better when it's presented in a fun form ... so if I'm craving something sweet after my WC meal, I would go for this.   \"Cheesecake on a Stick\": Like its brownie counterpart, this cheesecake piece is bound to be the best little indulgence after a fast food meal. It's made with light and creamy cheesecake and dipped in a rich, fudge coating. I'm so down to try this chocolate covered cheesecake (both of these dipped dessert options were not available at the truck, so maybe I have to visit an actual WC restaurant to get it ...)   \"Bacon, Egg & Cheese Slider\": This breakfast slider sounds like one of the best ones on the WC menu. It includes freshly cracked, loosely scrambled eggs topped with American cheese and crisp, hickory-smoked bacon on a steamed signature bun. I'm a huge fan of breakfast sandwiches, so I would be willing to try this breakfast slider if I came to WC when the breakfast menu's being featured.",

Anyways anybody that grew up back east should know White Castle. This is the first location in the west so of course it had to go on Las Vegas Blvd. Not sure what some people were expecting or built up in their minds about this place. It's exactly the same it's always been just higher prices (not extreme though) because of the location. As a Vegas local and someone that grew up with eating here I can say it's good but not deserving of more than 3 stars.   PROS Same White Castle you have always had. If you enjoyed them in the past you will enjoy them here They serve beer which is pretty cool  Dining area seems to be well kept and clear of trash   CONS Location..  Good for the company I'm sure but locals absolutely hate coming to the strip. I understand why the first one had to go here but wish now there was an easier one outside of the strip to get to  Size.. As I said well kept and clean but not nearly big enough for the amount of foot traffic that comes through.  Some employees... Look I work with drunk asshole tourists everyday too so I understand what they go through but there are some (not all) here that have just  nasty attitudes. Granted it's a few bad apples but they leave an impression. A few times the fries were old/cold and asked politely for new ones and have been met with sighs and eye rolls. Please expand into the local area!",

Spent almost $50 and could have done way better with $15 at dell taco.  The best part of this experience was the smoke drenched casino attached and the jameson filled Irish coffee you can get while waiting 30min to get inside.   If you want White Castle go to the frozen food section at your local grocery store.",

I was interested in going to this place after I watched itsjudytime's (Youtuber) husband, Benji raved about it when him and Judy came to Vegas.  To be honest, it's not worth the hype. People say this place is pretty bomb since it's an East Coast branch but it was all right.  The portion is super small so you def have to get some more items if you're hungry. I got the regular sandwich (with buns and sausage link pattie) and loaded fries. The loaded fries tasted much better because it had a nacho cheese sauce with bacon.   Other than that, if you're into trying something new. But I would pass! Oh well!",

Then the popularity from Harold & Kumar happened making want to always try a White Castle restaurant. I finally had my chance this summer in Las Vegas! I was actually feeling like a little kid again as we were on our way walking up the strip looking for this place! A special adventure! I was so happy to finally eat at a White Castle! To me, this was the first mini burger I have ever had, so it was unique.   I ordered the 20 pack of sliders and 2 regular fries combo pack. $25.99 before tax. Sitting down and laying them all out for my girlfriend and I people thought it was all to myself since she was in the restroom. I laughed and said no, I could have eaten all of it, but not today :P The burgers tasted exactly like the frozen ones, just a bit fresher. Not too surprising, would give them a 3 stars. But the extra star for me was the service and overall experience I got from finally eating at this place! Highly recommended for a quick burger bite! Would go back again next time I visit Vegas!",

Also if you want mayo, oh GOD it's like gold to the employees, they will only hand you 3 for every 10 sliders. Now to price.  HELLO!!!!!! Lower the price. \"Vegas\" price is such BS and if they want to say because the rent is high us another stupid excuse. These sliders are only worth $.87 a piece and not over 1 dollar like they charge here. It's really not worth the hype and I find that In & Out is 10 times better. They actually put flavor on their burgers.",

Which is amazing considering the line NEVER stops.   They do have beer on tap. I should've got one...might have made things taste better!  The food was fresh but nasty and soggy. Not my thing. Chicken rings are gross. Why do they get to call it chicken???  The onion bites weren't bad. Not making another trip just for those though!  I can say \"been there, done that\"!",

Even though it wasn't mind blowningly better than the frozen ones, I was not disappoint one bit. The original hamburger had a very rich beefy flavor; while the cheeseburger was nice and cheesy. It's soft, simple, and quite addicting.   As good as whitecastle may sound, I wouldn't go out of my way to get it. Afterall, it's still fast food. Probably not the best for your health.

The patty was thin and the looks of it was different from the kind of patty I am used to. Bun was soft but from the heat and being in a paper box, it was a bit too soft or bit soggy when I got it.

Out of sheer morbid curiosity, we arrived at White Castle a few weeks ago and saw no line and figured it was as good a time to try as any.   We shared some sliders with cheese and chicken rings along with some fries. Prices were a bit steep, but that's to be expected for the strip.   I was surprised that the food wasn't as awful as I was expecting. It wasn't necessarily good, either. I favored the chicken rings to the sliders, which as people have noted are steamed and therefore have a mushy texture that I didn't enjoy. The fries were forgettable, so I'd avoid those.  Their drink and ice machines weren't working and people were bottle necking fighting for the one side that was actually functioning.   All in all, I guess I'm glad I gave them a try, but it looks like one and done for me.",

The lines are about 20 minutes long and the sliders were similar to the ones you get in the frozen food section.   Pretty disappointed in this place but I already expected it. The sliders looked like they were just slapped together. The only thing I liked about it was that they came in mini boxes. The meat was small and mysterious. We picked up a bag of hot cheetos to put it in our sliders to cover up the taste and it worked.   I got the Combo #2 (~$8.99) which includes 4 cheese sliders, fries and a soda. Next time I'll pass on this.   Overall, will not come back to this location. I would give White Castle another try but in the East Coast.",

    "text": "White Castle!!!!  I was so excited to see that a White Castle had opened up in Vegas.  I have been wanting to try it ever since Harold and Kumar.  I already knew going in that I was probably not going to be blown away by White castle.  I had tried the microwavable ones and they were okay.  It is fast food and sliders, so I was not expecting gourmet or even In N Out status.  I was just excited to try it just for the sake of saying I had it before.    It is open 24 hours and located inside the Casino Royale.  We were staying at the Venetian which was just a short walk away.  The line was pretty long when we got there but it moved pretty quickly.  Their menu mostly concentrates on their sliders and they have a few slider combinations that you can get.  We decided on 10 sliders with cheese and a side of onion slices.  Each slider comes in a square box and has chopped onions and a pickle inside.  We got our order pretty quickly and headed back to the Venetian to enjoy our food.  The people working there are really nice and good natured.  They were having fun at their jobs and our cashier had a good personality.    I read a lot of people complaining about the size and relative price of the burgers.  It is a slider, that is what they are known for and it is fast food AND it is Vegas.  Everything in Vegas is like a dollar or so more in pricing when compared to another city where tourism is not so heavily relied upon.  Seriously though, lower your expectations a bit beforehand and you should be good.   Despite thier small size, those things pack quite a punch because of the buns.  I got full after eating about 4 of them.  The first one I ate, I thought was really good.  The onions, cheddar cheese, soft bun and thin patty came together perfectly.  I did not even mind the pickle in there and I usually hate pickles.  I thoroughly enjoyed my first one.  By the third and fourth one, I was enjoying then less and less.  If you have had the microwavable ones, then you have pretty much tasted what they taste like.  They taste exactly like the microwavable boxed ones except just a tiny bit better.  The onion chips were really good.  I would definately recommend that if you like onions.  The breading is crunchy and thick.  We ended up having two sliders left over and I ate one at like 5 am when we got back from the club.  Still pretty good, but the bun got really hard.    I enjoyed my sliders but then again I came in with low expectations.  If you are not from the midwest or east coast and you just happen to be in Vegas, I would definately give it a shot.  It is open 24 hours anyways.  I do not think I would crave them but I would get it again if it were convenient.",

They boast 100% beef but the slices were too thin to notice anything amiss. Bread is very soft so it easily soaks the juices from the patty. Portions are small so even with my small appetite, I ate three and was still hungry.   Not bad. I would definitely go back and buy a box of this to bring home the next time I'm in Vegas.   Lots of tables and booths and the employee wiping the tables was so nice. Props to him, anytime customers left a table, he would immediately wipe it down.   The place is good for a quick bite, a snack, not a meal. It's just food to keep you going for the night but won't make you heavy or full.",

I was extremely happy to be vacationing in Vegas & see that there've finally arrived on the west coast!!!  Those who've written bad reviews obviously are those who probably eat at the Golden Arches & think that's good... From the smell & taste you can't go wrong here, with or without cheese love these little burgers!!!  If your not a beef person check out the chicken rings trust you'll leave satisfied!!! Love me some White Castle",

    "text": "So who was the wise guy that thought a whopping two registers was going to cut it? There's an army deep of prep workers and cooks in the back and periodically over a block long line of White Castle fans, with a team of security directing traffic and you only have TWO registers? Yeah, its awkward.  O T H E R W I S E...  Woohoo! White Castle is officially in Las Vegas! I can't speak on behalf of anyone else, but White Castle holds a special place in my tummy. I was born in Minnesota and still have family living there, so whenever I would visit, my uncle would welcome me to town with a crave case. What says love more than a giant box, shiny with grease, filled with sliders?  Of course, this is nowhere near the top ranked best fast food burger, but it wins in the nostalgia points! Mini sliders with grilled onions - you can't go wrong there -  portable, cute, easy to eat, and especially reminds me of my childhood. Their burgers taste like how I remember it, so they don't do a bad job at this Vegas location but consistency is questionable. On our second visit my sliders were all too soggy for my liking - which is not good, not good at all.  I actually prefer the original sliders over the cheese slider since the cheese overwhelms the flavor of the grilled onions too much and I love love LOVE the flavor of the grilled onions. Sometimes I would try to ask them for extra grilled onions and most of the time I am unsuccessful, but it's worth a try.   We also dabbled in their cheese fries with ranch and bacon and the crew thought it was pretty tasty, but I think their crinkle cut fries need major work and typically taste stale. I really like their ranch sauce so I dip my sliders in it from time to time. Also pass on their onion chips, the batter is dense and not that great. Their shakes are simple, vanilla or chocolate - nothing crazy, but its not bad either. I don't think they offer a strawberry shake at this location since I would of been all over that. Oh yeah and they have brownies and cheesecake on a stick - just thought I'd let you know.   I can typically eat 5 sliders on a good day and it is filling! For a normal person I think that 3-4 sliders is just right. For the overzealous types they also offer crave cases  and crates that range anywhere from 30-50-100! Dang. Don't come in here expecting an amazing burger - just great memories - KEEP YOUR EXPECTATIONS IN CHECK and I think you will be in a good place.  RIP stomach.",

However, after waiting in such a long line, I was disappointed to see that these burgers taste EXACTLY like the microwavable burgers. Even the fish filet sandwich tastes exactly like mcdonald's fish filet. I just wished they tasted a little better. Granted, I still love how white castle has sliders because its small and is more fitting for my small appetite.

Happy they got them here. Mostly friendly staff,  and clean restaurant. It does take a little while to get your order. Most of the employees are working fast and hard. Several are just standing around holding up wall I guess.  However it seems to me they have to many people working behind the counter. There really isn't enough space for so many workers. I will come back. The wait is worth it to me. Ask for jalapeno cheese. Yum!",

If  you're one to compare it to in and out, your taste buds got some evolving to do...there is no compsirison! WC is better. And if Harold and Kumar is your only refereence to these little angels, thats sad.  Much like most of the places on this strip, WC is always packed, but the staff is unfazed! The drunks, the Half Naked, the Regular Folks like me are all treated to the same great service and regular 15-30 minute wait on a good day (first visit was like an hour but since I didn't have any heart transplants to preform or any nations to conquer, i waited. That's the reason I came that day!) Because it's SO busy, you never have to worry about any food that's cold. The grill is ALWAYS going! The cost is the only thing I'm not liking. Seems about $4.00 more expensive than its Midwestern siblings for the same meal, but hey, it is Vegas. All in all I'm geeked that there is a taste of home now only 4 1/2 hours away by car and I try to take it as often as I can!",

    "text": "The 2 stars are exactly what it means. I have experienced better. Whether it is the frozen ones at Smiths in the frozen food section or sliders from other restaurants, the actual sliders I had here at this location was mediocre at best if I was I really hungry.  Im trying to understand how east coast  peeps grew up on this garbage. This is definitely one of those spots that are severely hyped up because of the fact that this is the only White Castle closest to the west coast. The funny thing is that the first day they opened, they ran out of food! What a fail on their part. You're open 24 hours. You know you're gonna have patrons lined up for miles but yet you just happen to run out of product.   I knew eventually I had to try it just to see what the hype was. I have only tried the frozen ones so far. So a couple of my friends are here from out of town. Of course they want to try it. So off we went.  Located just inside the Casino Royale just right off the strip, you line up starting outside if it is really busy. One thing is for sure, I dont think this casino has never seen so many people in their establishment. Since it is a part of the casino, you will be exposed to the smoke factor. You cant smoke where you can sit down and eat your burger but yet you will be inhaling enough of it coming from the casino itself. They have security posted outside where the line begins and one right at the door where you enter.  So far I have gone 4 paragraphs without any mention of what we ordered. That just shows you how really bad the food is. While my wife went and stayed in line to order food, I scoped out a table. She came back with two craver packs for our group along with loaded fries and 4 drinks. The total came out to 51 bucks and some change.   I was somewhat hungry so I ate 2 regular sliders with cheese. In the other craver pack I also ate 2 regular sliders with pepper jack cheese. Now I LOVE onions but the ones they put in these sliders taste like reconstituted onions. You know, the dry kind that has to be mixed with water to bring it back to life. Then they grill it. The smell of it now that I think about it almost makes me want to vomit. The patty itself does not look like a real beef patty. Referring to my pic, it looks more like prop comparable to those fake plastic fruits you will see in some people's homes. The only thing that may have peaked my interest was the pepper jack cheese. Had a little kick to it. As for the loaded fries, I was no longer in the mood to eat after surprisingly eating 4 sliders.  Service was actually decent, otherwise this would be a 1 star review. From standing outside to making it in to order, all took a total of about 25 minutes with 10 waiting for our finished product after ordering. They have one security guard outside to watch the line while another one is at the door entrance to make sure nobody cuts. This was surprisingly organized. Too bad that's it. Oh and that they are open 24 hours would be the other thing.  In closing, if you have never been here, by all means, try it out so you can make up your own mind if its worthy of a trip to the Casino Royale. I mean, you don't really hear too many people talk about going to the strip just to go to a not too well known casino.

Its always super busy here which is assurance that everything is fresh, hot, & ready to go. They ppl here a great system to get you in & out.

If sliders are on the menu, I'm 110% all about sliders. They're just really delicious, bite-sized, soft and convenient little burgers. My girlfriend thought they were okay and tasted just like the frozen ones, but every bite was extremely satisfying.  It ended tragically though. My motor skills weren't all there and I dropped a whole slider on the floor. Rest in peace, slider I never got to enjoy.",

So we just went and honestly, I'm not sure how I feel about the place. The burgers itself were kind of dry but I really did like the grilled onions in it. I just think if there was some sort of sauce in the burgers, it would've been much better. I was expecting much more.  However, the price wasn't that bad. We got the combo with 20 burgers and two fries and it cost $25. So that wasn't bad at all.

We opted for the number 7 combo which consisted of 10 sliders, 2 fries, and 2 drinks. We upgraded the sliders to have cheese because who can eat a burger without cheese? Total after discount came to around 21 bucks.  The sliders were good and didn't require ketchup surprisingly. The fries come unseasoned so you need to add your own salt and pepper.  The downside is that you wind up having gas all day after eating them. The plus side is theyre way better than the freezer stuff.",

I liked the overall flavor of the sliders, especially the grilled onions, but the patty was like the consistency of a McDonald's patty. I also liked that there were different sauce options but some were kinda bland. Fries were good, no problems there. I did appreciate that the sliders were individually boxed and that it was reasonably priced.  Service was awesome - everyone at this location was so sweet and made sure that our order was correct.   I really don't have much to compare White Castle to but I have to say that out of In-n-Out, Shake Shack, and White Castle - In-n-Out is still my number one choice when it comes to a burger. If you haven't tried White Castle, it's definitely worth a trip to cross it off your burger bucket list.",

Low and behold signs on the way to Vegas advertising for White Castle.   No traffic, no crowds, no parking issue was going to keep us from going.  Park behind and walk to the front of the strip location.   The customer service was great, the location is clean and inviting and the food was so, so delicious.  The burgers were just as good as I had hoped, and the dipping sauce zangy sauce was OUTSTANDING.  I tried to find a copycat recipe of it online, but have failed.    I will definitely, be back when in Vegas again!   Love White Castle.",

It's a bit tough to get to.  I parked at the Venetian and took the long walk all the way to the strip to get to the restaurant.  It's not necessarily big but there should be enough tables to accommodate who's in line.  If you've had White Castle before, I always say its good if its late night eats or if you're pretty drunk, or both.  Other than that, the food isn't exceptionally great.  In fact, it's actually a bit on the expensive side.  A four slider meal with a handful of crinkly fries and a coke goes for about $10 after tax.  Not really cheap.  You actually might still be hungry after that.  I don't hate it but if it was a few bucks cheaper, I think it would be a better value for your buck.",

I'll be honest, these are not the best burgers I've ever had - nor are they best sliders either. But hey, they're tasty and they get the job done. They're pricey but that's common in Vegas, but I must say the sliders with cheese are delicious. Their chicken rings, yes \"RINGS\" are delicious as well. So if you find yourself nearby while walking the strip and need either a small snack or full meal, try it.  It's not the best burger in town, but it's a tasty for what it is.",

This is located in the Casino Royale casino, in between Venetian and Harrah's.  This past time we went, we tried 1 of almost every slider available. Here's my personal ranking from best to worst: Double cheese slider  Original slider w/ egg and cheese  Cheese slider  Fish slider and veggie slider Chicken ring slider and chicken breast slider I hope that makes sense. I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the two chicken sliders. The fries are a must here, especially when they're freshly fried. Also, don't forget to ask for all your sauces at the counter when you pick up your food! The food usually comes out pretty quickly, so don't be discouraged by long lines!",

Of course that was many years ago and you could get them for around 25 cents, that's really showing how long ago that was. So I was glad to see one open here on the strip. So I packed up the wife (who never had one) and off we went. After a short walk and a short line we ordered. Shocked by the prices, but everything costs more today. Told the wife how good these were while growing up. I guess all things change from what I remember. As soon as I pulled the burger from the package it seemed the burger was way thinner than I remembered and after the first bite I was disappointed on the taste. Guess this is off our list on coming back along with the \"shake shack\" also. How disappointed this was from the memories of my youth. Pay a little more and find one of the other burger places nearby so not to be disappointed.",

I expected there to be a wait so I won't complain about the 1 hour and a half that I stood in line but I will complain that the line is like General admission for the club. I don't think they thought thoroughly about having a line outside on a busy strip sidewalk. Also I wasn't that far back in the line so I thought once I got into the building I would be minutes from ordering. Okay so the food; when I received my burgers they were lukewarm after coming fresh off of a grill! I also ordered chicken rings and they didn't have honey mustard! Dont even get me started on the employees! They need to bring some people from the MIDWEST to train these people. For those who have not had White Castle before this is not what all of us Midwest folks were excited about! It wasn't nearly the experience from back home! I agree with those that said you can go to the frozen section for what they are serving up here. Also they need to figure out how to get one off of the strip and with a drive-thru and breakfast. I will not be returning to this location.",

Let's cheapen the food and raise the prices because all we care about are profits. You can't slip anything by me though because my palate is so sensitive.

Its been 14 years since I saw Kal Penn and John Cho's awesome hysterical movie \"Harold and Kumar go to White Castle\". Fortunately White Castle decided to open a couple of locations in Las Vegas, not far from my native San Diego!  Well...those slim, salty, soft, gentle, and delicious cheese sliders lived up to the hype and satisfied all my dreams!  Its not your typical burger, these sliders are served in the softest white bread bun with a extraordinarily thin slice of beef, grilled onions, pickle and generic American cheese...somehow these very basic ingredients combine into a near perfect harmony of meaty, cheesy, and carby deliciousness.    $8.99 for the 4 cheese slider combo with fries and fountain drink...I'm sure that's much more expense than the typical non-Vegas location, but its cheaper than trying to drive out to the east coast to save a couple bucks. Note: Avoid the chicken sliders...so gross!",

Ordered one regular breakfast slider (egg and bacon), another one with sausage, hashbrown bites and a coffee. The egg and bacon slider was pretty good, the sausage one had a very weird taste, but the hashbrown was the real MVP here. The coffee was absolutely terrible, had a sip and I had to throw it out.  Service... nonexistent, we were the only ones there and even though there were 5 people in the back 'working' our food took an eternity, not because of the cooking part, but cause the people were basically sloths.",

Being connected to a casino you would obviously expect it to look like it had some major traffic going through it and did it. The restaurant was run down and dirty looking, homeless people littered the place. We waited in a long line for at least 20 minutes and finally ordered. There were about 20 or so people working behind the scenes to ensure this machine ran efficiently as possible and they failed completely. After ordering it took a solid 30 mins to get our food. And when we go it is was cold and not very impressive, I know I know what did I expect? Well....what I got I suppose. ",

Food was ready pretty quickly and as we set our bags on the table we noticed the grease already starting to come through the bag. But this is totally normal for any fast food place.  I gotta say, this was a good choice for burgers and fries in Vegas. AND we were completely sober! I imagine this spot is packed at night with people looking to soak up their booze (or other substances). If you need something quick and less expensive, this is a solid choice!",

Adamant that having only had the frozen White Castle burgers, I absolutely HAD to try the real thing. And, being that her advice has never led me astray before, I was all for it!  So, after making our way through a few of the sketchier casinos farther down the strip for the sake of escaping the heat, we finally found it. Nestled way back in Casino Royale! Not the fanciest place for them to be, but it really doesn't matter all that much to me. They do have a door that leads straight out onto the strip, but being that it's summertime, you take the walk through the sketchy casino.  As for the food, we tried four plain sliders with cheese and one fish slider. Proooobably wouldn't try the fish slider again... But, the cheeseburger sliders were great! I very much enjoyed them. Not-so-surprisingly, they were much better than their frozen counterparts!   Having now tried this iconic chain, I don't think I'd necessarily make it a destination. It's definitely someplace I'd pop into if I were close and wanted some simple noms, though.",

Of course after getting our order and mocking him the burgers and onion fries tasted exactly how we thought it would taste. Definitely not a bad thing but also something that I wouldn't crave.

    "text": "I'd prefer to give it a 2.5 rating.  I am so appreciative that the owners of the local Las Vegas area White Castles finally joined the corporate-owned restaurants in offering the Impossible Burger patties.  They're much better than those nasty Dr Praeger veggie patties they used to serve up until earlier this month.  But come-on, guys. $3.60 (plus tax) for each vegetarian slider?    You're White Castle, and these are sliders.   Please come back to reality, and lower the price.  I know they're quite popular -- only three people in-line -- the woman in front of me ordered one, I ordered five, and a guy that picked up his order shortly before I did had ordered some too.  But I really believe by lowering your price, you could greatly increase sales & profit off the volume -- with a reasonable price, you could count me in for about 10 a month, instead of the 5 I had being it for the whole year.  The place wasn't busy when I placed my order at 1:44PM on a week day -- just one couple in front of me, one or two people behind me, and maybe about 10 people in the dining area.   Yet after waiting 11 minutes to hear my order # called, I decided to walk-up to the pickup area to investigate.  There was a bag sitting on a prep table, a worker called-out someone else's # & he came to pick his up (he'd also ordered some Vegetarian sliders) and after it was handed to him, I asked the worker about mine. She checked, and it turned out to be the bag that's been sitting on the prep table for the past couple minutes, but she told me it'd just been made ready.  It was now close to 14 minutes after I was issued my receipt, again, at a fairly slow time.  As much as I love their new vegetarian burger using the Impossible patty, 14 minute wait for White Castle *sliders* that cost $3.60 +tax apiece -- $17.95 before tax for the five *sliders* to fill my belly is NOT at all a good deal, and for that price, I can go to a nicer place and get a full-sized veggie cheeseburger with the Impossible patty, plus fries or a drink.  I also ordered Onion Chips.  I shouldn't have. Very little flavor, & a tough deep-fry coating that made me worry about chipping a tooth.  Yeah, you're on the high-rent Las Vegas Strip, but you're WHITE CASTLE, serving SLIDERS inside Casino Royale, not some place serving full-size burgers or located inside The Wynn.  The fact that you have a uniformed security guard there much of the time to shoo the vagrants out should remind you that you're not a classy place.   I love those veggie burgers, but PLEASE lower the price to something commensurate with who you are, where you are, and what you're serving.    I won't  be back until that happens.",

When we walked past White Castle on the Strip - we had literally JUST eaten dinner - but he was so excited he went inside and bought 10 sliders. He vowed that we would end our night here as well (which we did, at 4 AM).   The sliders are super cute, and each come in a personal sleeve so they're easy to eat. The bread they use is super soft and fluffy. I wasn't a huge fan of the cheese (it tastes like Kraft American singles) but the plain hamburger tasted pretty good! When we came back after a night out, I tried the Mozarella sticks. Not sure if they were actually amazing, or it was just the alcohol - but they were delicious! Great place for drunchies, especially since they're open 24/7",

Why must we be relegated to the grocery store freezer for a taste of their burgers?   Luckily for us there is one on the strip in Vegas. Understanibly they're open 24/7 to keep up with the demand. This is the second time I've been to this one. The people aren't the nicest or maybe they're just tired after dealing with drunkards for the duration of their entire shift, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  The food here with the exception of the onion chips is awesome and fresh. You can't go wrong with the cheeseburgers and cheese fries but avoid the double burgers as they have extra bread and tend to be a little soggy. There's always a line so patience is a must but it'll be well worth it in the end. Hope we get a real one soon.",

I tried it but don't think I'll come back to this location.  I will be going back to NY in couple month and I'll try to jog my memory but what I had in this Vegas location didn't taste as good as one I had in NYC.

I also ordered the chicken fingers and it tastes just like the Costco Dino bites maybe worse than that.  Overall, this place is quite expensive for a meal. I don't think I'll be returning back to White Castle again.",

I came to this White Castle because we grew up in Chicago and I knew coming here would bring back fond memories of what castles with my mom. What a horrible terrible disappointing mistake this was. Its 3 in the morning and the line to get the food is crazy the service is incredibly slow and the nasty clientele hang around here selling drugs begging for money looking like hookers is just absolutely disgusting. I am going to take my meal and leave I cannot wait to get away from this place. I'm almost tempted to not even wait for my hamburgers and just leave. This location is a horrible representation of White Castles. It should be closed just for the hookers alone. The Beggars and the drug dealers don't help either.",

When you go to their site it will list numerous of locations near me, but that is because they sell the frozen sliders. There are no White Castle locations near me so I had to try one.  As soon as I got there, there was plenty of seats and no line. It was in the afternoon when I got there. I was surprised to see they had beer there. That's cool! Beer and sliders. Great! I ordered my food and it came out quickly. Woohoo! I'm glad I came at the time I did since the place got busy as I was leaving.  I went with the cheese sliders and fries. The sliders were warm and tasty. They were so good. The bread was soft and the patty was tasty. I wasn't expecting crinkle fries for the fries. They were ok. This is a place you should try at least one.",

Because of that movie (one of my fave movies btw), I have also been a fan of White Castle before trying those bite size burgers.   Luckily, before they opened up shop in Vegas, I had to settle for the frozen squares at the local market.   Now that we are lucky to have our own White Castle, I finally got to try them!   I was not disappointed. I knew what to expect and I can say that they taste a little better than the frozen - microwave version I tried before. Still a fan.   It's convenient if you're walking the Strip. Once you pass this, you're gonna wanna pop in and grab a couple to continue your walk.    There are toppings available. Try them if you haven't before. Prices are reasonable. Keep in mind, it's on the Strip.   The only thing missing was a photo booth with Harold and Kumar! haha John Cho..... :-)",

    "text": "YAY! Finally we get a White Castle on the west coast area. I live in California and they do not have one here. We decided after riding the High Roller we would pick up some burgers.  There are two locations in Vegas, this one is located on the strip, and the other is somewhere in Fremont. This one is located inside Casino Royale. We entered right from the strip, so we had to walk through the casino, but then we saw there is an entrance that will take you right through to White Castle's seating area. There is not a ton of room to sit and eat, which was fine since we took our food to go. The line was long, which from what I saw was constantly long. This location is open 24/7. I ordered a #1, 4 burgers, fries and a drink for $8, a side of onion chips for about $2 and change, and a brownie on a stick for $2. It was like $13 and change. They were out of the cheesecake on a stick which I wanted to try. You can get ranch, mustard, ketchup, and other condiments for your meal.The staff wasn't super friendly and seem annoyed with tourist. So these reviews on here crack me up, because many people think this is supposed to be a high class burger joint. Dude, it's White Castle. It's what Harold and Kumar, our stoner friends from the early 2000's, embarked on to try. This food is for sure drunk/stoner/junk food.  Now, my favorite menu item was the onion chips, which are pieces of onions deeper fried and super crunchy. Really tasty and addicting. I recommend with ranch! The fries taste like any crinkle cut french fries you may have had elsewhere, but weren't bad. The burgers themselves were good, greasy for sure! The patty is super thin and comes with onion and pickles. I didn't eat the burger with condiments seeing as though I wanted to keep the traditional taste of White Castle. My friend was not a fan, and had ate the frozen ones at the grocery store. I never had, and I didn't mind it. I would get again for sure, but it's not my favorite!",

We stopped by midday and ordered one of the slider meals, adding mozzarella sticks to it. In the long wait for our food, I noticed that every person working behind the counter looked miserable. Everyone.   The food that comes out of this kitchen (despite its fast food quality) does not equate to the product sold elsewhere. Add to this the fact that prices are marked up to \"Strip value.\"  Come to the Casino Royale to grab a few cheap beers at the bar adjacent to this place, but don't feel bad if you decide to skip White Castle.",

    "text": "I lived in Indiana for 9 years. I learned to appreciate White Castle from the locals. I'm going with 5 Stars due to years of memories from that extended experience. This was before things like WC fish burgers and the newest veggie option. I don't understand all the 3 Star reviews and won't even try to. All I can do is state my own opinion.   Venue: Very small shop, by Las Vegas standards,  that is right off the strip and is right next to/inside of  a casino. Most easily reached by walking a distance once you find a place to park. There is no convenient parking to speak of. So I recommend combining a trip to WC with something else. Small eating area that was full because the shop was so busy.  Food: The traditional White Castle menu is very simple. Onion Chips, Regular White Castle Burgers, and White Castle Cheese Burgers. But, I don't eat meat burgers anymore. So I was very interested in trying the fish burgers and veggie burgers. These are non-traditional items. I'm sure some are shocked and appalled with the concept. I was motivated to give these a try as I may not get to the midwest in the near future.  Veggie Burger: Good but a great effort at providing meatless. i appreciate the effort. They provide a choice of sauces with these as they are needed. The fish burgers were a similar strong effort. Well appreciated by those on dietary restrictions.   Yes,  I was a bit underwhelmed by the veggie burgers but the chance to indulge myself in old memories was priceless. I'm glad I made the effort to seek out this White Castle experience.  Service: 5 Star Service from a very busy crew.",

They don't look great, the location is small and weird right inside of the gross Casino Royale, everyone inside is plastered, and it just doesn't matter. When your number is called and those little boxes of heaven are handed over, all the pain in the world goes away and the most amazing flavor of deliciousness is all that matters.  I suggest getting doubles; double the meat, double the cheese, double the fun! I just prefer the extra meat and gooey cheese to bun ratio better than the singles. I also prefer the jalapeno cheeseburgers to the regular ones. It is not a spicy jalapeno flavor at all, just a little kick to let you know it's there. Just an added bonus for who like a little spice.  There's not much more to say. If you're looking for a gourmet burger, this is not it. But if it's late, you've lost some money at the tables, and you just want something delicious to chomp on, this is the place. The lines can get long, but who cares? It's Vegas. Grab a drink and relax. What are you in such a hurry for anyway?  SIDE STORY: My wife got hit on right in front of me and I still didn't care. White Castle. That's all that matters.

    "text": "This White Castle location gave me the worst customer service I have ever received. I was verbally abused by the manager working and will not be returning until Christina, Kandy and Nikky are reprimanded and/or let go. It was July, 27 at 3:10AM and I had asked Nikky if she had called my number. The screens that show what number is ready we're down and she wasn't using the microphone so I could hardly hear. She stared at me for 30 seconds and I asked again did you call my number or are you just gonna look at me? She said \"did you hear your number?\" I said I didn't know and she said \"you didn't do you can go sit down\" in a rude tone. I went to sit down and when my number was called, her coworker (a male standing next to her) had already complained about her being rude to him so she was moved to the back. I asked for the manager and Kandy came. I told her the story and she was apologetic and said she would handle it. I watched as she went nothing and resumed what she was doing before. Irked, I ate my food and went back up asking the nice worker at the handoff for both of their names so I can call corporate. He said that he could get her higher up manager if I pleased so I said yes. Christina came up and immediately told me \"you need to back off you're being confrontational by coming up and asking for me and it's none of your business how I'm going to handle this situation\" blah blah blah. Excuse me, isn't that your job to deal with confrontation about poor service as a manager? She told me Nikky would be allowed to work the rest of her shift. So... Nikky can just abuse her coworkers and customers and continue working? She was staring at me the whole time I was complaining to the manager and again, not working. I was mad so I left and called corporate. Again they were apologetic and said I would like to be contacted back after they talk to the restraunt. I haven't heard back. No email, no call or ANYTHING. I also emailed the store and haven't heard anything back. I will be calling again tomorrow and if I hear nothing back I will be posting to my 6,000 followers on Instagram, most of whom are from Vegas or friends that come to visit that I used to take to White Castle, that they should boycott the restraunt and I will continue to share this story of the rude customer service I and others endured. Thanks for nothing.",

    "text": "Many years ago, I visited a White Castle back east (once) so I knew what to expect, but we decided to give this place a try just because it's new to Vegas.  Before I get to the food, I have to mention that the two cashiers were both visibly annoyed at the customers in front of us, and they treated the couple two spots ahead of us in a completely unacceptable manner, simply because they were new to the menu and unsure how to order, making an annoyed face and screaming \"NEXT\" to get to the customer behind them. I was sure to place my order as quickly as possible (we ordered the #2 cheeseburger, fries, and drink), so at least the cashier appeared to merely tolerate me as I paid. This place has only been open a few weeks and the employees at the front are already burnt out. What's up with that? With so much unemployment in Vegas, couldn't they have found a few cashiers who are a bit friendlier?  As for the food - well, it's White Castle. It is what it is. Tiny, thin burger in a plain bun, with a bit of cheese and onion. There's a burger in there, but can anyone really taste it? I estimate the ratio of bun to burger is about 8:1, so you'll have to eat a huge amount of bun before you get much burger in your tummy! The fries were just bleh.  About the location - I'm not sure where to park to get into this place. There is no parking in front, so we ended up parking in the Venetian and walking back to the Strip, but surely there's a spot closer than that? Also, there were TWO security guards working this location, which only amplified the negative vibes in this place. And our table was damaged enough that it made eating uncomfortable - such a shame at such a new location.  Not recommended.",

What a Waste of money.  Not only that but it took way too long to get my food and the constant yelling of numbers made the atmosphere unbearable. First time here at this place and definitely will be my last time. You have been warned: don't ever eat here!",

However, after watching Harold and Kumar, I've always wanted to try White Castle. Luckily, they finally opened one up in Vegas in Casino Royale and I just had to give it a try. Just walking in, there isn't much separating white castle from every other fast food joint.  I ordered 4 cheese burger sliders with some fries for around $8. Boy, did this place suck. Honestly, minus the cool boxes the sliders are in, the cheese burgers here taste the same as the burgers I microwave. Same goes for the fries. Just salty empty carbs...   Overall, this place disappointed me. Next time, I'll just buyer the microwaveable ones and just eat those or I can go to the millions of better burger joints in the area.",

Well we were always wondering if that place is really as good as the movie portrayed it to be or was it because they were having the \"munchies\".  I was finally able to try this place, turns out I stumbled across it while walking up and down the Las Vegas strip. The place is pretty busy, especially since you have everyone from the strip just drinking and looking for food. Which in all, isn't a bad thing. That means it must be good.  What I ordered was two chicken sliders with loaded fries. It's cheap, I only paid $8 and thinking these small sliders were not going to fill my appetite but they sure did. The chicken and buns were fresh, no stale taste. The fries were the amazing part to me, loaded with bacon and ranch. I just couldn't get enough of it.   Give it a try next time you are wandering around Las Vegas trip, it's quick, cheap and will get you fed so you can continue your Las Vegas adventures!",

You can actually buy the 6 pack White Castle frozen burgers at Target, Safeway, and Walmart, which are very tasty if you microwave them properly!  The only difference from the real deal is they don't have pickles on them, yet taste almost exactly the same as eating in person at the restaurant!  On my recent visit to Las Vegas, White Castle was #1 on my list of tourist things to eat!!!  My brother has been to the ones on the East coast, so he told me they opened up the very first West coast WC on the Las Vegas strip a couple months ago.  To my surprise, it was just across the street from our hotel :D  I was very happy to discover that White Castle is open 24/7.   My first visit, was in the late afternoon, loooong lines, a bunch of loud drunk people, no where to sit, and crazy busy wait.   We opted to eat a quick snack instead at the little Footlong Hot dog place in Casino Royale, and came back next day 10am!!!  NO LINES and NOT crazy busy lol.  Definitely had to try the Double cheeseburgers, Onion strips and of course the crinkle fries.   I loved everything, Double cheeseburger was great, comes with the tiny onions and pickles, crinkle fries were great, and Onion strips were good.  I really didn't mind the prices, for my first visit, it was worth it.   I just want to say if you are a big eater, make sure you get yourself at least 4-6 cheeseburgers because they are tiny and won't fill you up compared to regular cheeseburgers elsewhere.  I think White Castle is more like a snack for some people...  Staff was very friendly and helpful, place was clean too!  I am really glad I had the opportunity to come here and try it out for myself.  It really was more about the experience and enjoying my vacation in Las Vegas.  Next time I come back, I'll try the chicken rings and loaded fries.   Menu is simple and easy to order from, and for drinks they have a fountain soda machine.",

That being said my pregnant self wanted a slider for a snack at 10 AM and this place delivered. There was no wait at 10:00 AM (surprise surprise) and the food was cheap (for the strip) and came out very quickly (maybe 3 mintues?).

Finally got my chance to and I don't regret it. The prices of the sliders were delightful and affordable. Quality isn't top notch but I feel like it's more enjoyable than a McDonald's burger. And it simply melts in your mouth, it was great, I didn't know that a slider could run like gold down your throat.   I was also really big on the free onion ring slices that came with the sliders. That was amazing! I didn't even ask for that and there they were! I think that's a thing? Am I wrong? Or did the server just love me that much? I'd like to think it's both. Yeah probably both.   While I loved the flavor of what I ate, White Castle is definitely more of a late night snack than a stomach bloating meal. For me at least.  But I loved it none the less.",

It was OK and had too much filler in it that it didn't taste like hamburger meat. Also, it was pretty bland. I liked the soft buns on everything, but it's not enough to bring me back.

If you are going to drive there, maybe reconsider and have an Uber or Lyft driver, make sure they drop you off at the casino (where white castle is located) front on LV Blvd during a red light. Like I said I made a mistake of driving, pulling into park at the Venetian, and then you have to find your way over to the casino where Whitecastle is located and then make your way back. Definitely delicious once I got my food and I would probably go again if I was actually walking near by already on the strip. I almost felt like I was either Harold or Kumar. Total mission for these sliders. ENJOY!!!",

Luckily, this fast food restaurant was open 24/7 so after a night of clubbing, my friend and I headed over to this place for a quick meal. There was definitely no lines on a Tuesday morning around 4am, and I quickly ordered one original slider ($1.29) and one chicken ring slider ($1.99) to try. The cashier proudly told me he had 15 chicken rings for lunch when I seemed hesitant in trying the chicken ring slider. I was definitely not hungry enough for 15 chicken sliders, but you do you boo. However, props to the cashier working on this 4am shift!   When I received my sliders, I was quite surprised at how tiny these sliders looked. They were about the size of my palms and I'm pretty sure I can eat the slider in one bite if I tried hard enough. Taste wise- they were both okay. They were not mind-blowing and I don't see myself craving these sliders in the future. They actually tasted a bit plain to me, since there was no special sauce included in the beef or chicken slider. I guess this a good place to grab a quick bite if you are on a budget since the prices were more reasonable than other restaurants on the strip. I can't say I won't ever be back, but probably not in the near future.",

Well ok maybe not everything.....I will admit at first it was a bit difficult to find (was across the street pretty much from Mirage and tucked inside the craziness that is the Harrah's portion of the strip), but once I did it brought me back to the days of my youth in Minnesota and damned if nostalgia didn't make this meal taste that much better..Oh yeah and I'm talking about the REAL White Castle and not the supermarket abomination!  So I just kept it simple and got a bag of sliders with cheese (no condiments needed and that's a bold statement from this guy). It was just as I remembered from the taste to the smile at the end. They are small in nature, but I don't feel like a fatty if I pound out 5 of them! I did like the fact they are put in paper containers now and the pickle in the middle gives it that perfect hint of umph when partnered with the tender meat and gooey cheese..Just thinking of the slider salivates the mouth indeed!  I did take notice that the line does get a bit lengthy, but doesn't that tell you your taste in food is better than most? I thought the staff managed to kill the line pretty fast, so for me waiting wasn't a complaint at all. I also found that they treat you with respect if you give it back so my experience was just as I remembered it.  All in all, I will be back again and this time I just might bust for the 100 slider snack pack..Signed, sealed, and delivered their mine!",

    "text": "Every time I see this place, I think about Harold & Kumar go to White Castle. Although I've seen and passed by this place every year for the past several years, I finally decided to come in and try the place in February. I actually walked from The Excalibur here and walked back. In a way, it was my own White Castle adventure. I was able to snag a coupon from a guy about a block down and that really sealed the deal. The restaurant was pretty packed, there were absolutely no seats available, but the line was very short when I got in.  I got the 4pk cheese sliders with a drink and fries for about 9 bucks before the coupon. I was kind of expecting the prices I heard in the movie, but I'm thinking since this is Vegas and on the strip, everything is like 50-100% more. Food came out within about 5mins, and I took it to go and ate at the fountain right in front of In N Out. If you ask why I didn't just go to In N' Out, it's because I have one close to home, so I wanted something I can't get back home. The burgers themselves actually didn't look very appealing. The meat kind of looks like spam (not that I have anything against spam). I have had the frozen ones before and those looked better. As for the taste, it wasn't bad. Typical fast-food burger taste, but the little chopped grilled onions add a lot of flavor. I was pretty full after eating all 4 of the sliders. I would probably come back again if I had a longer stay in Vegas. If I'm only here just a few days, I would probably rather have something a bit nicer. The only exception is that my brother is pretty crazy about these, so if he ever comes along on one of my trips to Vegas, I'll bring him here so he can try to eat 20 of these lol.",

I also had the vanilla milkshake, which was pretty good. It tasted like an In N Out shake, but sweeter. The fries weren't that bad either, I would eat them again. Lastly, the onion chips were probably the best out of the whole meal; they were really crispy and delicious.   Overall, I wouldn't come back here by choice but it wasn't a HORRIBLE experience. Their staff was friendly and service was quick, impressive since it's pretty full..being on the strip and all. All and all, i say come and try it out for yourself.

My husband almost got into an altercation with one of them because he made us feel extremely uncomfortable & also unsafe.

Came here with high expectations due to:  1) Everyone ranting and raving about how great the burgers are 2) It's renowned reputation in the East Coast 3) they made a movie about how amazing it is!   Always wanted to try it after watching Harold and Kumar so naturally when I had a chance to dig into a pack of these \"amazing burgers\" during my last trip to Vegas, how could I not???   Although the service was great, the staff worked hard & fast, and the restaurant was constantly being cleaned (thus the 3 stars), the burgers were just OK and left something to be desired. They were mini burgers with paper thin meat that you could hardly taste and bread that was somewhat soggy due to the pickles/onions. it was a huge let down when I took my first bite. I immediately regretted being overly excited and buying a whole pack of these mediocre burgers! My husband and I didn't get through our pack of burgers and ended up throwing them away knowing we weren't going to eat them later.   Huge disappointment!  :(",

There literally was no difference at all in terms of taste.  3. Don't plan to go to hot yoga after because you will get bad gas. seriously... big mistake  Overall: It's really overpriced and the taste is comparable to the ones you can buy frozen but I will say that they do not taste all that bad.",

I was very shocked at the standard of meat being used in the burgers.. it looked inedible and made me want to feel sick at the site of it..   The cheese and onions being used looked burnt and plastic looking..   There was no sauces etc inside the burger it was plain and stale...   The prices are cheap, however I feel this place is more for those who are heavily drunk or intoxicated by other means...   I would never try White Castle again...

I say this because it tastes exactly the same as the frozen microwave burgers.  Exactly? Well not really because there is a pickle in these ones.    The location is on the strip in the small casino north of the Venetian by the Linq parking lot. It's very fast paced and as soon as we ordered we weren't able to fill up our drinks halfway before our order of 20 cheese sliders, 9 piece chicken rings, onion chips and fries were done.    To say the least it was not the most rewarding way for me to break my pescetarian seafood diet.  At best it could be said that you could enjoy the satisfaction that us West coasters can now join the likes of dining in an East coast fast food institution.  Not as rewarding as the opposite experience is for East coasters trying a Double Double & Animal Style Fries from In & Out for the first time.    We got hugely full sharing a 10 pack of sliders for 2 and the baby loved the chicken rings though.  We brought the second 10 pack home for my little bro.  Sadly he had to microwave them slightly by then.  Completely rehashing the same old feeling of eating them the frozen way.  He noted that it was cheaper and more convenient to have just got them at the freezer section.  They may even use the exact ingredients at the restaurant?  It was fun.  Everyone should try it at least once.  I may rather stick to a grilled cheese w/ grilled onions with Animal Style fries & a 7up next time without the strip traffic though.",

That being said, their sliders are pretty good for the price. The sliders are on a soft pillowy bun with grilled onions and pickles with the option of cheese.  We received a text 3 days before the official opening date stating that White Castle was giving away free food. Within minutes we were out the door and made the 20 minute drive to the strip.  When we got there, there was caution tape preventing us to enter the restaurant from the casino, but we were able to see the entire restaurant. We saw kitchen staff making sliders and contractors making finishing touches. We figured that they would give away all the sliders they were practicing to make for the grand opening. After being told that they were only giving them to casino employees we decided to hang out for 45 minutes hoping for the chance they would have extra for us. We even offer to pay for them.  The patience paid off and we went home with 14 sliders and fries for free!  The customer service was amazing. Curious casino patrons would peek into the White Castle and sure enough an employee would come over to answer questions and encourage them to come back in a few days when they officially open.   They open Tue, Jan. 27th at 2pm!",

    "text": "I was real stoked to hear that White Castle opened up on the strip. And since we were gonna be in town for the big fight weekend, I was hyping up getting a crave case at some point during the weekend. Good thing it's open 24 hours but its location is a little tricky in that you really have to be in the immediate area and just walk over because it's smack dab in the middle of the strip by Harrah's and across the street from the Mirage... I was bummed to find out that this particular White Castle location does not offer the bacon-cheese slider or the jalapeno one. LAME. The bacon and cheese one is so good. Whenever one of my relatives flies to LA from Queens they bring a crave case of that goodness but none in Vegas?? That alone is worth the deduction of 2 stars.  We got there after spending a few hours at Omnia nightclub and were all starving. Luckily the line wasnt too long. We only waited about 10-15 mins before we ordered. As soon as we sat down, the line was crazy... We ordered a crave case. That's 30 sliders. We got half classic and the other 15 with cheese. We got 4 orders of large fries and sodas. The sodas are refillable so that's good. The crinkle cut fries are decent. Some are crispy. Others were a little soggy. The sliders which I was so looking forward to were a little disappointing. Not because bacon wasnt an option but they just didnt taste as good as I remember. The weird thing was the original ones without the cheese were tastier than the ones WITH cheese. They seemed to have way more of the grilled/steamed onions on the originals than the cheese slider. The difference in taste was significant. And I was pretty disappointed... Dont get me wrong. I still scarfed down about 6 of them bad boys but I had no choice, I was starving. But I was still disappointed because I couldnt figure out how the sliders hand-carried on the plane ride from Queens and reheated in the microwave were better than the ones right off the grill in front of me. Puzzling... I hope it improves because if someone like me whose \"lightly\" familiar with the White Castle menu is disappointed, what more for someone that's a tried & True Craver. Harold & Kumar would not approve...  Funny story... As we were finishing up. A slightly tipsy and partied-out couple who didnt want to wait in the long line for their food offered us $10 for 2 sliders... SOLD. To the lush couple... Only in Vegas.  Service was ok. Definitely no enthusiasm from the cashier that helped us. Theyre probably over it with the characters they see on the daily... Be better White Castle Las Vegas. You should be better than that.  ps - cousins from Queens brought over a crave case a couple of weeks after this trip and sure enough, they were tastier. taste comparison complete... I was right. Vegas needs to step it up.",

    "text": "Simply put - their burgers/sliders suck. I walked in with pretty low expectations and they didn't even meet that. But you're likely going to check out White Castle anyway whether it's out of morbid curiosity like I did, or because of nostalgia.   I stopped by on opening day because I was walking distance away and had a friend already in line. The line moved relatively quickly, but White Castle way underestimated the wait time. It's nice that they handed out free sliders as a sorry, but ironically that well intended gesture made me consider getting out of line after sampling their sliders. But I promised to bring WC back for other people, so stayed in line.  Great service for a fast food place especially on opening day. Everybody was helpful nice, and smiley despite all the chaos - I read they were churning out around 4,000 sliders an hour, which is insane.   I've never been to another WC before, but heard that they're normally priced around 80cents each vs the cheapest you'll get it here is $1.09 with the 100 pack. They can say the higher prices are due to higher rent on the strip, but that's bs - they would've made up for that with the ridiculously high volume this location will do, so they're just plain greedy. But what can you do - it's the only WC west of... think it was Missouri?   Anyway, back to their crappy burgers. Yes I know that sliders are small, but paying over $1 for something that's 1/18th of a pound of weird gray \"beef\" is just silly. For comparison, a McDonalds hamburger (also crappy) is 1/10th of a pound and at least looks more like real beef than this does. The bun was ok and I like grilled onions, but I did not enjoy tasting them for the rest of my day.    I guess it's WC's thing that they never dress the sliders for you - want some ketchup and mustard? Too bad, you get grilled onions and pickles - anything else you have to add to it yourself. Not a huge deal, except that you need to know to ask for it, then wait for the guy to get packets from the back because they don't have them out to just grab. And he only gave me 1 packet each of ketchup, mustard and mayo for 10 sliders, so thanks for that because ketchup and mustard were the only things that gave the burger any taste.    Also ordered a chocolate shake because the lady said they're amazing since they're made from frozen custard not ice cream or soft serve. It was a decent but overpriced shake, which was so thick that I couldn't drink it through a straw. I have no idea if that's how they always are, but a spoon would've been nice.   I would normally say well I didn't like it, however you should probably try it out for yourself. In this case I have to say eff it - skip the lines and the clusterf*ck we call the strip and just pick up the frozen ones from the market. They sadly do taste about the same and I think are cheaper.",

That's amazing for a Grand Opening first day.  White Castle is now open on the Las Vegas Strip, across from The Mirage and inside of the Casino Royale. They serve beer via those cool stadium bottom up cups. The sliders are small, so be sure to order more than a few at a time.  Their drink stations easily accommodated all of the people on opening day, so they should be good to go from now on. I like their fudge covered cheesecake bite on a stick for dessert.",

At least they didn't last night.   Overall, a worthy stop for the White Castle experience. Would rate Detroit #1, Vegas #2 and New York (Brooklyn #3)",

My group and myself felt so ill and bloated afterwards that we would all rather regurgitate the food than continue to walk around the strip with it in our stomachs. These sliders were soggy and terribly put together. The sliders you get back in middle school that were in a bag were way better than this. My fries either had the flu or were just old because they were pale and felt like rubber. If you are sober and looking for a decent meal to eat so that you can sight see, DO NOT EAT HERE! The food will make you sick. Never again. Best thing was the fountain drinks.",

The manager at the location took the time to explain how they grill their burgers and said that they could make their sliders with no buns. They even cleaned the grill before they made them and kept them separate from all of the other burgers. The taste of the burger was amazing for fast food. They were a little pricey, but the flavor of the food made up for the price. I would definitely recommend going here if you are looking for a quick and delicious night night snack!",

The bread was so soggy that it was falling apart.  The meat itself felt like mush and the onions would have been better if they were caramelized.  Not a fan of this place at all.

It's connected to the Best Western/Casino Royale's food court, which let's face it, is not the most stellar hotel/casino out here.  I did go out of my way just for this food, but it was worth it to me.  Again, just the fact that it's out here is worth a lot.  Now I only have to drive 5 hours, not fly across the country, if I ever get another craving.  :)",

The kitchen staff here is obnoxious and uncouth, and the dining/cashier area is filthy.  The clientele is bottom-drawer strip scum.  Eat here when you're broke and don't have any plans for self-respect.  EDIT**  The business manager decided to respond.    Michael, while I appreciate the clapback laced with PR platitudes,  a somber fact remains:  This branch is an obnoxious dump.  This reflects upon the way you run the place, and through the people you hire.  The food itself was actually not bad, so whatever brand quality you've attempted to maintain with respect to the edible product was satisfactory.   However, it's impossible for you to escape the abject, at best, dining experience one could expect of a visit to this White Castle.  The employees use gratuitous profanity with no regard for ambience.  The lack of attention to cleanliness in the dining room makes for a vulgar jarring of the senses.  Why is there food on the floor in the queue area in direct sightline of the cashier staff for 15+ minutes?  Why must the dining area reek of disinfectant?  It's adjacent to a smokey, aging Casino, and yet the dominant aromas are not the sizzling meats or the bread, or the cigarettes, but the fucking mop which was leaned up against the soda fountain and then, somehow, forgotten.  \"Vile Nature\" is right.  Maybe make that the name of your shitshow and the discrepancy between expectation and product wouldn't be so dramatic.  Until then, I wish you luck in capitalizing off of any moron who would order food from this place.  Instead of taking personal offense to this critique, you should use it to stop repelling potential customers.  As you were, citizen.",

The casino that it sits in is rather dingy and dated, but perhaps that is why it was available. My least favorite part of coming here is just getting in and out. When you try to turn in off the Strip, there is a constant stream of pedestrians who have no intention of letting a car through, then you have to run the same gauntlet when you leave. Once I was waiting for almost five minutes to get enough of a gap in the pedestrian ant farm to turn in to park. Unfortunately, there is no rear access to this place, so Las Vegas Boulevard is your only way in. On the upside, staff is generally friendly and they keep the line moving even when it is long. They also offer a ten percent discount with a local ID (although this isn't displayed anywhere in the restaurant). Seating in the dining area is limited, especially at the busiest times.  WC should consider putting some restaurants out where locals live. I would eat here a lot more often if it weren't such a hassle getting in and out - plus it's about 20 miles from my house.",

You can buy sliders individually without a combo meal or without getting a 10 pack. I ordered 1 slider (just to try it) and the 9 piece chicken rings. Slider was about $1.29 each (which I'm told is more expensive than their usual locations, probably because it's Vegas).  Super disappointed. The whole slider can probably be ate in 1 bite and it just melts in your mouth in a bad way. You dont even need to chew. I'm all for soft buns, like shake shack buns, but this reminded me of wonder bread, which is probably as artificial as it gets... There's also little to no patty. Chicken rings were basically flattened out pieces of chicken cut into being shapes. They were like onion rings. You also have to ask them for ketchup.  Yeah, its probably the cheapest you can get in Vegas, but its also just low quality food that you should probably just skip. Only good thing is that you get your food fast after you order.",

First mistake: I didn't realize the sliders come with pickles and onions. It was my fault, although they were not pictured or described on the menu. I was starving, so I brushed the undesired condiments off my sliders. Sadly, I only made it through 3 sliders before my stomach started to hurt. I feel a little sick. so I decided to toss the last slider and call it a night.",

    "text": "Was surprised to be walking down the Vegas Strip and happen upon a White Castle!. The exterior and interior design of the building is very well done - nice stone work on the exterior and great use of wall graphics inside. Surprisingly, the floor plan works very well, especially considering the long narrow nature of the space they had to work with. Having security was a good idea - it helped keep traffic flowing.   As for the hamburgers themselves, they were very well cooked. We enjoyed double cheese, regular White Castles and cheeseburgers as well as fries. And you always have to top it off with a Coca Cola. The burgers were cooked very well - in fact they were some of the best I've had in a long time. Some people think they are greasy but it is actually the steam cooking process that results in a nice soft and somewhat juicy bottom bun. Everything was very fresh and hot off the grill.  We also enjoyed their krinkle fries. These were good as well, though I am more a fan of sweet potato fries.  With White Castle, you either love them or hate them. I suppose I love them - and the Las Vegas location did not disappoint. Customer service was very good as well. I had the opportunity to have brief conversations with several of the staff and they all seemed to be genuinely enjoying their new workplace. They had cleaning staff making sure the front room was clean as a whistle and that recently vacated seats were ready for new customers. It was also good to see they incorporated the Vegas theme in the signage, including a slot machine menu sign.  All in all our visits to the new White Castle in Las Vegas were very enjoyable. The quality of food and service was great. We highly recommend it to all relocated East Coast Nevadans.",

    "text": "I first had the honor of noshing on these edible miracles, while attending the U or MN (Twin Cities), beginning in 1969 (Sliders were 12/each, then).  I had a \"dry spell\" (living W of the Mississippi River) until I visited NYC in 1976.  Since then, none.  Now, it's like a prayer has been answered in my favor, and I can once again re-live my college days, even though I am now 65 and can't down the 20 I used to put away at a single visit in the 1970s.  I have a friend in Meadview AZ who's more \"addicted\" to them than I am, so if he has HIS way, I'm sure he'll be traveling the 218 round-trip miles every weekend, and crying when that's not possible.  While I'm glad they have finally opened an outlet in the Las Vegas Valley, I only have one question regarding that:  WHY didn't you open one here, in the 1970s?",

The highlight was the warm juicy onions against that little crunch of pickle.   The location in vegas has just missed the boat. They were tastless, over salted and soggy. I was so ticked I went to the manager and said these are not white castles. He asked me where I was from, told him, he laughed and said me too, then he went back there and made me some himself. Those tasted right.   Ultimatly I think it is the fact that you have non-chicagoans trying to make vintage Chicago food. It would be like having a blind guy pick your wardrobe... he can get close because someone told him about the colors but never dead on because having never experiance them, he doesn't  really know what the colors are. (No that's not a dig on blind people). Same deal here...",

It is connected to the Casino Royale but has its own store front so you literally pass it when walking on the strip.  You can see and hear slots in the dining room.   I've tried them in the frozen aisle before and ended up tossing the rest of the box because I thought they were awful then.  I was hoping that maybe getting it fresh would make a difference.  UM, no.  They were pretty awful.  Patty is thin as paper with no flavor.  Bread is soft and soggy.  Price was also a lot for the quality you get.  $7.99 for 4 sliders, ordinary crinkle fries and a drink but it could be because they are on the strip.  Even my husband was not crazy about them either.  It was good enough to try once but I won't be coming back.  I just don't get the fascination?  Give me In and Out Burger anyday.  Heck even Burger King beats it and I can't stand Burger King.  They get an extra star for friendly staff. As for the complaint about the trays, that is the least of their problem.  The whole thing was so bland.  Would be good for kids.",

    "text": "I ordered 4 regular sliders, no cheese, one order of fries, one order of chicken rings, a 20 oz drink, black ice tea non-sweetened with a 16 oz beer and the end price came up to $17.05. As you can see in the picture below, the price doesn't bring much quantity to the table. The sliders were really nothing to rave about in flavor, I have tasted something similar before during a Thanksgiving feast eating ground beef stuffing with dinner rolls. They add a bit of chopped onions and a single pickle. The fries are a bit buttery in taste I suppose but enjoyable, they don't taste frozen either. The chicken rings were delicious as well, not too salty for my taste, and they can come as sliders too. The best part of the meal was when I ordered a second helping of 4 sliders, with cheese this time, and onion wedges, the onion wedges were perfectly fried, their fried crust had the consistency of what you would find in fried shrimp, very tasty, the second order was at around $7. Overall okay place to eat, nothing in terms of quantity but they do offer boxes with dozens and dozens of sliders for a hefty price. But other than that it is worth at least a one time visit if you've never been to White Castle, especially if you wanna know what Harold and Kumar are craving their munchies for, which isn't much in flavor or quantity.",

OMFG white castle seemed like fine dining compared to that place....but honestly this place sucks.  if you want late night food, eat secret pizza, tacos el gordo, or even grand lux cafe (haha)...white castle doesnt deserve to be a franchise.  it should stick to east coast, and not infiltrate the west coast, where people understand what good food tastes like!",

    "text": "No where like the ones in NYC.  No fish sandwich or clam strips. Chocolate shake was almost 6 bucks too.  Which brings me to the fact that the sliders in Vegas are about 45 cents more than the east coast which doesn't surprise me. Food out here in the desert costs more in grocery stores and most fast food chains.  Quality and taste? Well, the slider was on the dry side and the onions didn't exist. I'm not a fan of them anyhow and only stop in to see if the fish and clams are available yet.  Having no other choice, I pick up a few sliders.  Far from the worse place I've ever been, but anyone who's been to the ones in NYC will know the difference.  The \" good ole boys\" here in Vegas think it's a great place to eat and talk all day about \" no state income tax\" here. But that 900 a year to register there truck is fine and dandy along with all the other super inflated city and state fees.  Point is .....ignorance is bliss.  If you don't know what a real White Castle is, you'll be happy.  Every real NY'er I know thinks this Vegas location sucks. Will I be back? Not for a slider. Hopefully the fish and clams will be here.  Then again, they'll probably fuck those up too and charge 40% more for them since we're sitting in this \" rock quarry\" called Las Vegas.",

THE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE): - limited and narrow seating - with the limited space that this place has, it's pretty good on the traffic line for those awaiting to order  THE MENU: - castle combos - castle packs - bigger cravings - sliders - sides - dessert on a stick - beverages - breakfast  WHAT WE ORDERED: - the original slider - cheese slider - french fries - onion chips  THE LOOK/TASTE: - the packaging is so cute!  - the sliders were good!  - the french fries were basic - the onion chips were ok, i prefer them to be in rings  CUSTOMER SERVICE: - fast - polite enough, considering the high volume of customers",

    "text": "As a 12 year old boy, my friends and I were obsessed with Harold and Kumar and I mean OBSESSED. We'd watch it every single week after our Sunday league soccer games and always dreamed of going on a road trip to get 100's of those tasty looking  little sliders.  Unfortunately, that dream never did come True but 12 years later the reminiscing angels opened up the heavens and decided to let the King and Queen of White Castle land one of their castles on the Las Vegas strip!! Hallelujah right??! ....OH... HELL.... NO!   The spot is located inside the Casino Royale  Hotel, right across the street from the Mirage so it's pretty centrally located. It wasn't too busy when we went but it seems like the line goes very fast any ways. Maybe sipping on a fruity Phat Tuesday at the same time as ordering wasn't the brightest idea but either way the food here is absolutely disgusting.   I was EXTREMELY excited...remembering almost every line from Harold and Kumar as I waited for my food to be ready to grab. That excitement did a complete 180 Right after opening the bag, as it smelled like landfill or some type of sewage leak but of course I ignored it and proceeded to pull a couple regular sliders out of the bag and a chicken ring slider as well. Even though I was really hungry this stuff was so hard to swallow and digest. The sliders are almost as bad as dog food, actually I wouldn't even feed this to a poor little pup. The chicken ring sliders weren't as horrible but still tasted like dry cardboard.   I now understand why Harold and Kumar craved this place when they were high, because being high has to be the ONLY POSSIBLE WAY TO ENJOY THE FOOD HERE.",

Quite frankly it adds up to $15 or so bucks to get decently satisfied if you're a moderate eater. It'll hold up in Vegas fine. Quick service, surprisingly nice workers and decent burgers.

It was about 1 AM and I was starving so I dropped by to get some burgers. Given that I was starving and have heard such great things about this place I was very excited.  Little did I know this place is literally the worst burger joint I have ever gone too. Their burgers look like they are frozen and then simply just microwaved. I would NEVER come back here again and would advise that everyone stay away.",

Waited in line for 5 minutes and decided to order combo #2- 4 White Castle cheeseburgers, fries, and a drink.   The very friendly attendant recommended the onion chips instead of their regular crinkle cut fries. Great recommendation!  It's like onion rings but in wedge form. Burgers were nothing spectacular; steamed mini buns with grilled onions, processed cheese, a pickle, and a ham-like slice of hamburger. This place is overrated but makes a good and inexpensive snack (individual burgers are $1.29). Do keep in mind that each burger is the size of a dinner bun.",

The verdict: White Castle burgers taste just like the burgers you get out of the freezer aisle. They were pretty damn satisfying and tasty. The fries were good and the chicken rings were definitely questionable. I would definitely go back!",

And you can tell they're already made just sitting there, waiting for someone to pack it once you order it. It wasn't great nor was it horrible, it was just blah. And no one told me but they put ONE pickle in it.  I know it's a classic, but it ain't for me. Sorry fans. I'd rather spend my money at In-n-Out.",

I liked this one best. Had the best flavor because of the pickle.  -Chicken Ring Slider- two chicken rings with cheese. I wouldn't order it again and now understand why it needs the cheese. Without it.. Kinda dry. Fries- crinkle cut. Standard!  The boo is a fan of the cheeseburgers goodness. My beef (hehe) is that I'm not a fan of the soggy buns. Sorry!

    "text": "I don't know what to say about White Castle sliders...  Realistically speaking, there shouldn't be any reason why a slider from White Castle should be appealing: (1) cheap, soft, over processed rolls which are reminiscent of what you can expect from the buffet at Pondegrossa, (2) over-cooked, greasy patty cut in a ridiculous, bite-sized 2x2 inch square, (3) a diced and sliced mixture of onions and pickles that are better suited for a hot dog or a stupid, McDonald's hamburger...  ...And yet, they're surprisingly good.  They have the faintest philly cheesesteak aspect to them that I find irresistible.  And unlike a cheesesteak, which has sliced rib eye steak, a White Castle slider can't be nearly as expensive to replicate that flavor.  I'd say they're on to something, but then again they've been doing this for a while.  After all, some movie director even made a movie with the White Castle name on it which forever immortalized it in the bong-resin charred brains of stoners everywhere.  As far as I'm concerned, I only seem to dip into a White Castle every decade or so, but I was pleased to see that they have all kinds of different sliders these days: chicken sliders, jalapeno sliders, fish sliders, etc.    Maybe next time I'll get a double cheese slider and a bacon & cheddar grilled chicken slider.  Who knows?  It might get really weird.",

This white castle did in fact run out of hamburgers when it opened on The strip I remember the day that it happened and it made headlines It's kind of like a classy white castles if there such a thing",

While it wasn't anything TOO grand, it was very special and delicious nonetheless because I went back to my childhood the moment I took my first bite of the burger. You get a pretty good deal for $7.99 with 4 burgers, fries and a drink, and I'll gladly come back and eat here once more when I'm in town.",

I ordered one of every type of burger. The double burger with jalapeno cheese was my favorite--so melty, so soft, so delicious and perfect. I literally could have finished it in a bite. Burgers were not greasy one bit.   We tried the onion chips as a side since they seemed to be the most unique. I could have done without them, but they were a nice accompaniment.   I love watching the employees make the little burgers. So efficient and coordinated. It's gross looking at the raw little patties (I mean, who knows what's in that meat despite them emphasizing it's 100% beef) but still, it was delicious.   I can imagine myself finishing an order of 30 burgers if I could...  White Castle isn't In-n-out, my forever favorite, but every time I'm in Vegas, I'll be making a stop here.",

I'll admit that my nice experience was probably due to the fact that we were staying on the strip (so no need to drive and park), our wait on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend was less than half an hour, we met some cool people in line, and we found these two private seats over in a corner with a floor to ceiling window.  We got a ten pack plus loaded fries and a soda which really isn't much for two people.  But then again, what's the point of getting sliders if you're just going to eat 20 by yourself?  Go get In N Out instead.  I actually enjoyed the food, although I'll always prefer In N Out.  I can see why people say that you either need to grow up on it or be stoned to enjoy it.  We downed a few drinks beforehand, but I think I would still enjoy the food sober.",

I was pretty excited to learn that White Castle was fairly new to Vegas so the hype was intense. The line is crazy and the menu is like nothing i've seen before. You basically order for the group or small orders for 1 person. Obviously we went for the 20 burger combo with fries and the chicken rings. Seeing how the burgers are made is mesmerizing. The kitchen is pretty open compared to other fast food restaurants where large machines cover the process. White Castle however lays everything out for you to admire and salivate while you order. They cover the grill with the chopped onions and then place the patties on top. It is definitely a sight to see. 20 minutes later, we got out food which was well worth the wait. Those little sliders are so delicious and fresh. You almost feel bad as you count how many you eat from the 20 burger combo. The onions are probably my favorite part. The fries are really nothing special and i would not order them again. The chicken rings are pretty good but are pretty basic tasting compared to Burger King's. I ate 6 sliders by the way...",

If you have never been here, I recommend ordering a few extra burgers. They go down easy, I ate three of them no problem!  Perfect snack after a day of drinking!  Down side is the line is long but that seems to be a Vegas thing anywhere you go!  I will be back.",

    "text": "I walked by and saw there was no line and I had time to kill so I went in to try this hype. There's a part of me that was curious as I grew up in California where we don't have these. Ordering was pretty efficient and I got my order in a matter of minutes.  I've only ever had the microwaved ones to go by and there are pretty much the same slider with cheese in taste minus 2 things - these had pickles in it and the bread is softer since it wasn't frozen. I don't know if that is a positive feat that a microwaved product taste the same so you can have these anywhere or that it's pretty bad that I can see something cook up fresh on a grill and have it be no better than what I can reheat at home. Fries were pretty standard crinkle fries.  Maybe nostalgia is way more powerful and brainwashy in other people but I didn't really get this one. I already don't really get the crazy fandom of other fast foods, but I think some of those are justified after this.  In N Out, Five Guys are actually pretty good fast and fresh options so I understand how that can be satisfying.   Cheap lowest denominator type of fast food - the type for being  fat fucks, drunken and stoned. That is the only time I've ever gotten any sort of satisfaction from White Castle is a late night binge with friends who raided the supermarket frozen aisle, Taco Bell and Jack in the Box for some mad munchies marathoning while being too inebriated on drink, herb and food to move from their chair.   Being completely sober, drug free and  hungry after a long shift at work, my actual senses and judgement was yelling \"WTF....how is this worth a long line?\" as I took bites from my sliders.   I left a bit salty that I wasted my calories on that. These are the type of famous places that is the reason foreign friends think America is  gross when they try it, just by going by brand hype. I normally don't write pretentious fuck type reviews, but  I definitely agree our American fast food enfatuation is the worst.",

I don't know if the Las Vegas location does the brand justice, and I might be talking crazy here, but I actually prefer the microwave burgers from the grocery store.   The burgers at this restuarant are much greasier, inconsistent (one of my burgers came with pickles, the other did not), and somehow lacked flavor compared to its microwave counterpart. I also tried the chicken rings-just your average chicken nugget. I don't know if it is just a western state thing, but they did offer jalapeno cheese which was a plus. For the size of the burgers, they are certainly overpriced-but I guess that's nothing new.  Because it's Vegas, they have beer on tap, but it is of the cheap variety. But then again, it is fast food after all. I will eventually give this brand another chance in the mid-west.",

    "text": "Not sure if lackluster taste or just sober.  I've gone to White Castle locations in the East Coast a few years back and remember tasting the sweetness of caramelized onions with that salty square patty and having a huge smile on my face from the first slider to the last. This time around... not so much.  Granted it is a fast food chain and not much should be expected but nonetheless I'm voicing a little disappointment. I'm sure after knocking a few back through the night this place would have been a godsend but not when I'm sober and chauffeuring people from out of town trying to explain that this chain had a whole movie revolving around it.   The sliders do come somewhat neatly packed into their signature boxes and it's always a fun time when you take 20 of them to make a nice castle to DESTROY. We opted for half regular and half with cheese for this order.   Fries were under-seasoned and kind of took me back to the days of my childhood eating cafeteria food... you know what... let's just call this experience that.  Having White Castle on the Las Vegas strip in the early evening is like over-paying for the same $2.50 slider and fry combo you would buy at your school cafeteria during lunch. I wouldn't say it's terrible but it's not that great either. In our case, we went for the number 9* pack for 4 people and still left a bit hungry and our international friends very disappointed (sorry folks).  *Drinks and cheese are extra",

All we had before were the microwaveable burgers, and that certainly cannot match up to a restaurant's quality of burgers, right?   Well... White Castle is certainly good, but maybe not as good as we hoped. I would say it is slightly better in the store than it is from the frozen burgers. One view I have is that the bread and meat is not cooked long enough. If they were cooked an extra thirty seconds to a minute, it would taste much better in my opinion. The texture of the burgers are very similar to the microwaveable version, that is one thing that makes me not think it's that great. Their fries were pretty good, as well as their chicken rings, and that's what brings it up a little for me. The location isn't the greatest, but it isn't too far away from things where you have to go so far out of your way for it. It is a bit pricy in my opinion for the amount of food that you get, but what do you expect, it's the only White Castle on the west coast. It definitely is worth the experience, but not much more than that to me.",

Fatburger sucks 2. There's now a White Castle WAY OUT WEST  This fairly new White Castle is located in the Casino Royale ... which is appropriate when you realize that the \"Casino Royale\" is a somewhat divey casino with a Best Western Plus serving as the casino hotel. (Hey, at least it's not Ellis Island, right?)  It's been roughly 15 years since I was actually inside a White Castle, but the company remains the same ... Jersey-boy turned LV local and Yelper Jay F. was at my side just as he was 15 years back. (This guy used to smuggle White Castle burgers back to LV with him when he visited his parents in NJ. You can only guess his level of happiness)  White Castle is one of those fast food places that invokes a strong reaction from people ... and unlike, say, In-N-Out, the reactions can run hot or cold. Those who love it speak of White Castle as a holy grail of fast food, and worship the Crave Case deity. Those who don't get how a thin patty, dehydrated onions, and cheese steamed into one gooey concoction that \"slides\" down your throat (hence the name sliders) can be heaven on earth will be utterly confused about what the big deal is.   I had forgotten how sinfully delicious a sack of 10 White Castle sliders are, how gloriously gluttonously disgusting you feel after pounding so many sliders, and the distinctive aftermath that soon follows.   Ahhhhh memories ... memories that will last forever.",

When I finally visited on 12/17/16, I was sooooo disappointed.   I came pretty late at night and there was a line of people. The line went by fast and I ordered the original slider, cheese slider, chicken ring slider, and the onion chips. Total came to under $20 I recall which is not bad. Food came out fast and I was ready to dig in. The sliders were about the same size as the frozen ones but it seemed a bit smaller, maybe that's just me. But as others have pointed out, these taste just like the store bought ones. Depending on you, this could be a good thing? Maybe you like the consistency?   But like others, I was just expecting so much more!! I blame the hype surrounding White Castle. This place is too hyped up and I'm not sure how others could give it 3+ stars.   Don't get me wrong, I'm still gonna eat my frozen White Castle sliders. But don't bother going to the actual restaurant. You'll be disappointed!  Onion chips are good tho...?? I guess",

Well then, this White Castle is for you!! Easy to get to, not a huge line (if ur going at an off time), and a big payoff! Yesssss. Instant gratification. #winning  (PRO TIP: Not to be confused with the other castle, that's Excalibur.)  We came on a weeknight at an off-time, maybe around 5pm. No line whatsoever. Ordered a giant BOX of those mini buns of goodness and when our order came, the patrons' eyes around us got all big. They were all jeals for sure.  The burgers remind me of those little McDonald's happy meal burgers with the diced onions, patty, and buns but mini version. Awww. So cute. No frills. Just simple burgers. Love how oldschool and classic they make 'em. They are so good, that even my picky-eater, traditional Chinese mother loves them!   (PRO TIP 2: Eat the burgers there or at ur hotel if u live close by. They are definitely best fresh!)  We walked back to our hotel with our briefcase of burgers like a baus. Many people from security guards to random Las Vegas tourists stopped us to share with us how much they love White Castle, and to ask where we got them. Definitely felt like a celebrity! Haha, all part of the Vegas experience, if you ask me! :)",

    "text": "Been wanting to venture out to White Castle for about a decade now. Ever since Harold and Kumar made their voyage, I've been anticipating my own. Had a few days off from work and figured it was time to try these burgers fresh, instead of the ones from the frozen food section that I have once in a while.  Walking down the strip towards White Castle was awesome and exciting but when I finally pulled out my first slider my excitement faded a bit (not much, it's Vegas!). The bread was very soggy and they tasted about the same as the frozen ones to me. Though these had more cheese. Was expecting a fresh White Castle patty to be tastier. Maybe this just isn't a great location. I'm definitely trying White Castle again if I ever encounter another chain.  If you happen to stop by a White Castle I would firstly advise you not to settle for this and turn away. Vegas has so many better options! What? Sorry! If you're on some quest like me or just dgaf than I'd recommend asking for a toasted bun if you choose to eat here. It is a cool experience to have if you are a fan of the Harold and Kumar movies, but beyond that these burgers are kinda average (both frozen ones and these).  While the burger itself wasn't what i was hoping for, I was still glad I made the drive to White Castle. It was an experience I knew I wanted to have and though the burgers weren't satisfying, the overall experience was fun. Oh yeah and the fries were meh too. Though crispy. Throw some Cajun Seasoning on them sumbitches or something! Thank God for Ketchup.   Pros: + Staff was nice  Cons: - Bun was very soggy - Fries were bland - Location could have been cleaner (several dirty tables)",

I envisioned my experience at White Castle the same as Harold and Kumar, enjoying endless sliders in absolute joy, basically having the best meal of my young life. Unfortunately that does not hold True and eating at White Castle makes me appreciate In-N-Out that much more.   The sliders here are very thin, soggy, and underwhelming. They do have a strong flavor of onion as they are grilled on a bed of onions. The price of each slider is pretty ridiculous at 1.29 each because you need about 4-5 to be anywhere near satisfied.   I happened to enjoy the chicken ring slider, as it was fulfilling and lathered with some liquid crack, in the form of cheese, which was very pleasant to eat. If I was hella drunk out of my mind I would probably order 20 of these easy.   The onion peels take on the shape of a garlic clove and are deep fried. They taste just like onion rings and are not anything too special at all.   I wouldn't mind coming back to White Castle if it somehow it magically ended up in the Bay Area, but if I'm in Vegas again, I would definitely waste my money on something actually worth spending on.",

Ordered: Two of us shared Combo #7 - 10 original sliders, 2 fries, and 2 drinks.  This is one of my favourite fast food joints.  The buns really make these sliders.  They are so soft and easy to eat.  The patties are very small, so if you want more of the meat, order the doubles or triples.

Years ago, I had the frozen one once & IMO it was horrible. Everyone else claims the frozen was better but perhaps I got a bad batch?!  Reviews are so mixed here but the sliders were better than I had expected. For I am huge fan of sliders.   -:::- VENUE  -:::-  Located on the strip between Harrah's & Venetian. It's a good size location with it's own front entrance yet connected visibly to Casino Royale. We didn't bother with driving for we figured parking would be a pain. So we walked from the Elara hotel -- which wasn't bad at all. We went on a Saturday afternoon around 4ish & there wasn't a wait when we arrived. We didn't dine there for we took our orders to-go. The place was fairly clean with decent amount of seating (tables & high tops) and a self serve beverage station.  It's your typical fast food joint so really there isn't that much to expect. I like the outdoor venue castle themed decor tho!  -:::- SERVICE -:::-  The older gentleman who was cashiering was very courteous & sweet! Despite there was a line that came in right after us (& there was none prior!) he was patient & tried to get us the best deal for the amount of variety we ordered. The service was definitely quick & accommodating.  -:::- MENU/FOOD  -:::-  Mentioned by another Yelper & my gf (this was her 2nd visit) it's way better to order the Double Slider or Double Cheese Slider. Double the flavor! The buns are very soft & squish-able =P  I actually liked the slider size & the packaging.   All of us didn't bother with the combo or sides & went straight for the sliders a la carte.  Food came out pretty quick too. We all got our orders in less than 15 minutes. Eating it fresh off the grill/fryer is ideal. But we had some late night after clubbing & some the following morning for bfast which after heating it up in the microwave -- IMO it was still yums!   Interestingly, my group ruled that they liked the Fish Slider the best. I personally liked both the Double Cheese & Fish slider. Chicken was a bit dry but easily solved by packing on some sauces White Castle provides.   Double Cheese Slider   [4.5/5] Chicken Breast Slider    [4.0/5] Fish Slider                     [4.5/5]  FYI: this is NOT a gourmet burger (don't compare it to one) nor a gourmet slider. It is a fast food joint slider & it did the job! White Castle is one of a kind!  -:::- NOTES  -:::-  1) Sliders comes with pickles & onions. If you don't like either let them know ahead of time.  Next time I'm back in town I'm definitely hitting up White Castle again & to try their b-fast as well. I hope they open a White Castle in the OC in the near future!",

The line up was long and took about 20 minutes from entering to leaving with my food.  I'm not familiar with their sliders so I decided to get 3 of them and a regular fries.  I thought if I couldn't eat them all, I would share with my husband.  The line up to order was the longest wait, but the cashier was friendly.  After I waited on the side for my order number to be called.  It seems to be an efficient process with staff doing their part of the assembly line to get the food ready and placed in bags.  The woman who calls out the number also provides ketchup packets and is friendly.  When I got back to the hotel, I was disappointed with the food.  Each slide had a pickle and onions but the beef didn't look and taste very appetizing.  I was hungry so I did eat up eating all my food but now that I've tried it once, I know I never have to go back.  There's too many other great restaurants and food to be had in Vegas so I'll keep walking by next time I'm in the area.",

    "text": "I love how all of these east coast classics are making their way to Las Vegas! I guess that is the one perk about living in a city that is just one big tourist destination.  White Castle made its debut a few months ago in Casino Royale, a hotel that is smashed between the Venetian and Harrah's. White Castle is really easy to find since their have their own entrance from the street. I have read the reviews about the long lines, so I waited out the hype and my first visit was last week. I was there around 4pm on a Sunday and the line was not too bad-- I would say tops, 15 minutes.   We ordered four cheese sliders, a double slider, loaded fries, regular fries, cheese sticks, and drinks. The person took our order asked where we were visiting from and when replied that we lived here she offered us a 10% local discount. Sweet! You wait for your number to be called at the end of the counter. The food came out in about 5 minutes.   Cheese Sliders-- They are pretty tiny, seeing how the meat in the burger is about the thickness of about 10 post it notes stacked on top of each other. But hey, they were still pretty tasty. I like the squishy buns. Ha, that sounds really weird.  Fries-- Crinkle fries are better than any other fries in the whole entire world. So, I like!  Loaded Fries-- Meh, could skip on these. The bacon and cheese toppings were not that special.  Cheese Sticks-- I think these things could be good if there was better marinara sauce. The sauce comes in one of those sauce tubs that do not require refrigeration. It has a weird after taste.   After reading all of the mixed reviews, I have to say that my visit was better than expected. A lot of people are saying that it is not like how it is on the east coast, but that's how it usually goes. The original is always better. Don't even get me started on Shake Shack LV. All of our mini sliders & fries came out to be around $20-- but that was expected, since this is the strip. The next time I want to try the cheesecake on a stick or the chicken sliders. I think I saw a sign that said that they also have a breakfast menu.  Oh yeah, White Castle is open 24/7 to satisfy your after party munchies.",

Ordered the original sliders, which were good and fresh, but I don't recall there being any pickles in it? I like pickles, just not in my White Castle. Of course these are way better than eating them frozen from my local grocery store, but I think the White Castle in New York is a lot better. This location is open 24/7--awesome! Located a few minutes down the ways from Harrah's hotel and Fat Tuesday, right on the strip. I'll still come back to this whenever I'm hankering for a baby burg slider, but beware those drunks! Jeez. Seriously can't even order a burger without being harassed! Comes with being on the strip I suppose, but don't let that deter you away from a nice hot melty cheesey burg!",

After a few hours, I HAD to have some White Castle, damnit!   Upon entering, it's already a sad state of affairs. The tables are gross, have trash from prior diners all over them, and everything just feels dirty. But maybe the food is worth it?  The service was not very good. The cashier was nice enough, but it took forever for the food to be ready, even when our order was just a bunch of sliders you slap together.  + SACK 'O SLIDERS (10, $11.99): I ate FIVE of these damn things! I was starving! But the patties were too thin, and there was practically no flavor except for the mustard and ketchup I lathered on. I was thoroughly upset that I wasted stomach space for this.  Lesson learned is, don't trust two stoners to make your dinner choices.  ==== Food: 1 // Service: 2 // Environment: 1 // Price: 3",

    "text": "Okay, I like ALL KINDS of food.  Fancy food, simple food, cheap eats, expensive eats. I'm not discriminatory and will give anything a chance.   I have always enjoyed a White Castle for years, going back to visits in St. Louis and Kansas City when they had one years ago.    On a recent trip to Vegas, I popped in --- let's just call it \"late night\" or maybe it was \"early morning\"!  The White Castle I visited is in the Casino Royale on the Las Vegas Strip right across the street from the Mirage and just north of Harrahs. It's conveniently located right in the front so you don't have to weave and wander your way through the casino.   It has a walk up order counter with dedicated seating adjacent to the casino floor (slot machines).   Service is generally quick and the sliders came out just the way I expected them.  I ordered three sliders with cheese - steamy bun, square beef patty, grilled onions, cheese, pickle... that's it.  The combo makes for about a 3 or four biter, but they are surprisingly satisfying, especially after hours at the tables, machines, or just hanging out in Vegas \"hydrating\" with your friends!   Three stars, because this place has a cap to it --- maybe it's 3 out of 3 possible in my book or 3 out of 3.5.  They do sliders and so them just fine.",

We got 4 of the Impossible sliders, which at this location were a bit pricey at around $3.60 each plus tax. (On the website they are advertised at $1.99, but of course this location is inside a casino hotel.)   Almost twenty minutes later, we had our sliders. This was a long time for fast food especially in between mealtime hours, but we could see in the open kitchen that people were doing their best to catch up. I think they just don't have enough grills to keep up with demand. We have to subtract a star for the long wait and lack of customer service, i.e., thanking people for waiting or apologizing for the wait.  As for food, my partner enjoyed his sliders - they reminded him exactly of fast food burgers he used to get when he still ate beef. I didn't like them as much for the same reason - they tasted very much like low quality fast food beef burgers which I've never liked. I prefer the other interpretations I've had of the Impossible Burger, but I'm happy that they offer them at White Castle. This is a place to try once if you've never been in a city with a White Castle. Otherwise I'd avoid it.",

I was soooooo excited to find out there was one in Vegas, and I couldn't wait to take my husband while we were here.   He has never been to the original locations in the midwest/southeast.  He has only ever tried the frozen kind we get to microwave for our teenager.  I don't know if it's good news or bad news that the fresh ones we got in Vegas, tasted just like the packaged ones we get in the freezer section?  We each got five lil burgers and some fries.  The fries were not good at all, so we didn't eat them.  I ate 3 burgers but didn't even get to my 4th or 5th because they just were not good!  Ugh!  And the line, the service - all of it was just a shitshow of a scene.  Then, as a bonus, I got to repeatedly burp up the unpleasant flavor of the burgers until the next morning!  Lol.  Total bummer, because we ubered halfway up the strip to get our late night, legendary grub on.  And I know this is Vegas, but YOOOOOO.... these lil burgers were created to be cheap and simple!  What the!  $40?  Noooo!  The guy that started White Castle must be rolling in his grave.",

The pickle is an extra special surprise that is not on the frozen burgers.  This may have been the last time I enjoy these burgers. I've loved them all my life but the onion burps are just too much!

Prices are pretty high too but what do you expect for Las Vegas and on the Strip where they raise prices up.

    "text": "Eh   So I have always wanted to try white castle. I guess walking by the White Castle on the strip and having no idea it was here was similar to someone coming out to California excited to try in n out. I can't really explain the feeling of silly excitement to try fast food? It's almost embarrassing to admit.   Regardless on an impulse I went in with my friends, and waited in the ridiculously long line with a single cashier to place our order. We were looking for more of a snack and attempting to just try everything. Sliders, chicken rings, fries, and cheesecake stick is what we ordered to snack on.   Didn't realize there were pickles on the sliders, which I guess is my fault for not being more cautious, so that first bite made me cringe. However once I removed the green devil slice and got into the slider I was...well still not impressed. It's hard to judge a fast food place like a high class restaurant, but I was still disappointing. The slider was very akin to a McDonalds burger, and the chicken was airated. Fries were crinkle and a little bit cold which was upsetting.   If I had one close by I dont see myself ever really going over the other fast food chains which just are better.",

So I'm not from the Midwest and I didn't grow up on these, but I gotta say, these small hamburgers are damn good. Every time I come into Vegas I always get them after I've been out. The line can get long so be prepared to wait. These little patties are like basically sliders with thin meat and chopped up onions, catchup and mustard and a pickle. They are pan fried so they do retain a little more fat and grease which is why they taste so good. I do love their fries cuz they are extra crispy.",

Tastes like something I could've heated up from my freezer.   Pack of 10 costs about $11 and $3 extra if you want to add cheese But there's really nothing special or note worthy about the food.

The old man working the cash was extremely nice.

The burgers at the Las Vegas location taste worse than the frozen ones I've had before. The bottom bread was super soggy, meat not cooked well enough. Maybe it was the way they are cooked. I noticed they cook the meat patty with the bottom bun on top. Which makes it soggy and soaked up with meat juice. I feel this was a complete waste of money. I did not enjoy it and spent way too much for something I could have gotten at my local grocery store for less than 5 dollars.   If you want a good burger in Las Vegas go to Shake Shack or literally anywhere else. Do not spend your money here.",

Very crowded so consider me one of the people who came to say they were there, but the food is plain and tasteless in my opinion. We ordered the combo #1 and split four sliders an order of fries and a 16 ounce soda. Total cost $8.64 and a waste of 30 minutes we can never get back... Skip this place, swing by any McDonald's in America and call it good! And by the way.... The movie wasn't good either....",

I have no clue why anyone would waste a moment on this food chain. The line was incredibly long, they required three guards to monitor. Three. I expected a drunken brawl to pop up with this level of security. I ordered a 10 slider pack, 2 fries, 1 onion chips, and 2 drinks for $26.  There were no seats so we had to snatch a table at the Subway nearby. The wait was long but the word \"crave\" was scattered all over the walls so I thought that is had to be worth the wait. Welp, I was wrong.  I wasn't surprised by the size of the slider, they are meant to be tiny and cute, but I've seen cheese slices thicker than these meat patties. And overall it was bland, no seasoning whatsoever. Crinkle cut fries should have that extra crunch but these were limp and bland as well. Everyone knows to salt the fries straight out of the fryer, except these guys. I sampled a chicken ring from a friend. It's cute but nothing special. My friend did find a little bone in one of his rings. At least we know it's real chicken. The only star of the whole meal were the onion chips.  I loved the assembly line but I was disappointed that all of that hard work for food that tasted microwaved.  Oh, and did I mention that this morning I woke up to the sound of my boyfriend hurling his heart out? Keep in mind that we were sober all night. Definitely not worth the trip.",

You have probably been to many fast food-chain like McDonald's, Wendy's and Jack in the box... right? So why not add this to your list?  Yes it's a little overpriced but it's on the strip and  rent is high but if this place was elsewhere it will be a lot cheaper.

We stopped by on Saturday afternoon around 5:30, it took 45 minutes to wait and order, then another 10 to receive our meal which wasn't too bad.  We were able to find a little spot to sit in really quick, the table was clean but the space was tiny. The employees that I dealt with were friendly.   I can say that I am glad we took the safe route and ordered very little food, better safe than sorry. I got combo #2 which comes with 4 cheese sliders, an order of fries and a drink for $8.99, I also ordered 6 additional cheese sliders, an order of onion chips, and a fudge dipped cheesecake on a stick (additional burgers were for the kids at home). I ordered all of the cheese sliders without onions. When our number was called my husband picked up the order and brought it back to the table. I opened the bag up and noticed no cheese and onions on the first slider, so it took out one after another and noticed they all had no cheese but they did all have onions, on top of that, I didn't receive my cheesecake. I put the sliders back in the bag and took them back, they threw the sliders away and I waited another 10 minutes to receive the \"correct\" order. First 4 sliders were fine, cheese and no onions, other 6, cheese with onions. WTF! My receipt clearly stated cheese and no onions for all 10 sliders! At that point I was annoyed so I didn't take them back to the front counter, but seriously, you must really not know what you're doing if you get my order wrong twice. To top it off the burgers were semi-warm, they should be glad I didn't become very disgruntled.  I honestly wasn't impressed with the tiny burgers, I took a bite and to my surprise, it tasted just like a McDonald's $1 cheeseburger. The slider consisted of a bun, thin patty, and sliced pickles. The fries weren't anything special either, they tasted just like the crinkle cut fries that you buy at the grocery store and fry up yourself. Onion chips were okay, they were very crisp and had a semi sweet taste to them. The best part of the meal was my orange fanta beverage and the fudge dipped cheesecake on a stick. We spent $25 on our meal and thought it was a complete waste. Meal #2 comes with enough food to fill up a hungry toddler, not an adult. The cost is not justifiable to me, too little food for the price, $1.50 for a tiny cheese slider, no thanks.   I came, I tasted, too over-hyped.",

    "text": "I see a lot of bad ratings about this place and while I can see how some people might feel, I think they got it all wrong. I mean you can't compare it to anything else which some do talking about how you can get bigger better burgers. You don't come here for a double double, you don't come here for a 1/2 lb patty. These are White Castle sliders. This is what you come here for. These mini perfect two bite sliders steamed on a bed of onions.  The next complaint I hear is about the price being more expensive then back east. This is the Las Vegas strip. It's not cheap to be here. Let them make their money. It's not insane. Meals are about $8-$10. A damn McDonald's meal can come out to almost $7 or $8 off the strip, give them a break! In fact it's the same price or maybe even a little cheaper than when it comes to the foodie festival and no one complains about that. And this is a legit White Castle. Not a truck just serving the sliders.  The sliders are the real deal. The sides are good, small, but good. The service is impeccable. Even with long lines you get your food in 5-10 minutes. I got mines in 3. It's kept as clean as possible considering the crowd that comes through here.  The bottom line is this is secured in my places to eat at and I'm more than thankful to have it so close to me. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the casino it's in, and the type of crowd that comes from that casino. You'll see what I mean. To get an idea, as I write this review, there have been literally thousands of people who have gone here and only 55 yelp reviews. So they're not exactly the courteous foodie type.  But it's White Castle, and it's here, the farthest west it's ever been. Try it. Love it. Carry on.",

    "text": "Okay, let's get this out of the way right up front. White Castle is an ACQUIRED TASTE.  People who have grown up on In-N-Out or Fatburger or (insert burger chain here) probably aren't going to appreciate the food here, and that's fine (though, if you try them and love them; PROPS! and welcome to the club). Let me make one point though; it is possible that none of those places would exist if not for this burger chain. White Castle is the OG of fast food, established in 1921, and pioneered many of the technologies still in use today throughout the industry. This is the first , and only White Castle in The West. Like all White Castles, it is clean, and service is friendly and fast. It is located inside a casino, so that's different. Now, about the food; here's what to expect; the burgers are small and thin, and there are reasons for that. The truly unique thing about sliders (and please stop calling other places' mini-burgers sliders; they're not sliders, they're just small burgers) is how they are cooked. The meat never touches the flattop. It is laid on top of a bed of onions and cooked with the onion steam. This is why the meat is flattened so thin (and has holes poked in it); a thick patty would never cook with this sort of indirect heat. The bun is also laid on top of the cooking meat so that it gets steamed also. This results in a very soft, some would say soggy, bun. These features make White Castle burgers unique (well, almost unique; the southern Krystal chain makes burgers this way since they copied White Castle's model back in 1932). The burgers are served with the onions they are cooked on and a single pickle slice. As you can imagine, the cooking and serving method results in a burger with a lot of onion flavor. If you don't like grilled onion, this burger is not for you. You can ask for mustard or ketchup, but I don't. They are also available with cheese. I can't comment on their chicken sandwiches and I never will; my childhood didn't include that and when I go to White Castle, I'm reliving a piece of that childhood as much as I'm having a meal. Having said that, take the five-star review with a grain of salt; it might be biased.  ;-)",

    "text": "I finally got to try this hype machine and meh is right!  I've been wanting to check out White Castle ever since I saw the first Harold and Kumar movie. After my recent visit, its clear to me that you have to be stoned out of your mind to enjoy this place.  Located in the decrepit Casino Royale, this White Castle is probably the main reason people even step inside this place. WC takes up a pretty big amount of real estate in the casino but don't expect to find seating or quick service. Being the only Castle on the West Coast means this place is packed; lines are long, service is poor and its not rare to see people fighting over a seat in the dining area. If you must come here, parking at Harrahs next door or Mirage across the street should be sufficiently close.  The food here from my understanding is essentially the same as it's East Coast counter parts plus a few bucks cause you are eating on the Strip. The tiny sliders come with a paper thin slice of beef, a few grilled onions and a soggy bun due to the grease. The crinkle cut fries can be found at many other mediocre fast food spots. Skip the chicken rings and go buy some frozen nuggets from Costco, you will thank me later. The food is definitely over priced, a four slider combo with cheese runs for $9. Service was abysmal and place was a mess.  While waiting in line, the party in front of us was talking about how they grew up on White Castle in New York and how excited they were to finally eat here again. I guess nostalgia must be the only way to really appreciate White Castle. Oh and maybe after smoking a bunch of weed.",

    "text": "When I saw that White Castle got only 2.5 stars I was like naawww that can't be, but guess what; it's truly what it deserves.  Being from New Jersey, I pretty much grew up eating White Castle. Ever since I moved here in 2005 I always complained that there was no White Castle and that the frozen ones don't taste the same. But holy shit, I would actually prefer the frozen one's over these \"fresh\" ones. I was just insanely disappointed.  My husband has never had White Castle in his life and he really wanted to go randomly at 3AM. It's inside the Best Western casino/hotel which is just a really random place to have it in the first place. I actually didn't wanna try White Castle in Vegas because I already had a feeling that it wasn't going to live up to it's name here like it does on the East Coast and I was so right.  We ordered 4 cheese sliders to share with fries & a drink. Order came quickly and of course hubby couldn't wait to try it. The sliders were warm and the cheese was barely melted which means it was most likely just sitting out for a while. I let that go cuz I haven't had \"fresh\" White Castle in forever and I was just hungry as fuck. All was good until hubby bit into his second slider then started making this weird ass noise and faces at me until I looked at his burger and saw a freaking curly ass strand of hair in his slider. FUCK THAT. Instantly, my stomach just churned and I just felt like I had a stomach ache. I'm sure that if I hadn't seen that piece of hair I would've been fine, but that just ruined White Castle for me (at least in Vegas). He brought it to the cashier, hair still intact and shit and they gave him 2 double cheese sliders. Nice of the cashier but it still didn't make up for how shitty we felt after eating there. What's sad too is that I overheard other people saying how much this place sucks :/  So I came to the conclusion that I'm never going to waste a drive to the Strip again and if I want White Castle I will just go to Smith's and get the frozen ones. Seriously, you're probably better off not driving down there and dealing with all the tourist and drunk people.  It's cool that Vegas is trying to expand on all of the popular foods from other states but I seriously think White Castle belongs only on the East Coast. I still love White Castle though but just not this location. Maybe they should consider making a location away from Strip!",

The best item on their menu is probably the chicken rings, and they're not even known for that.

    "text": "So here we have it, the very first Castle of The Sliders to open shop west of the Mississippi River.   Now if you come here expecting a charbroiled masterpiece akin to Five Guys or In-N-Out, you've come to the wrong place. *side-eyeing most of the other reviewers here* It's not the highest quality food around and none of the nostalgic Midwesterners and East Coasters are saying it is either. What it is, is a place for \"cheap,\" late night grub after a debaucherous night out. An experience amplified by booze or \"greens\" so to speak. And now, thanks to Harold & Kumar, a meme in of itself. There's a whole novelty associated with it that up until now couldn't be experience by people on the West Coast. THAT'S what the big deal is, so if you fail to comprehend, care to spare us of the elitism?  Since this was a late night trip, I was able to walk right in. It was nice to see how fast they were working at getting food out for people. I was taken aback by the prices, but I guess it's to be expected since it's on The Strip and most people on this side of the country wouldn't know any better either way.   I must say, the fresh white castle sliders were a step up from the frozen ones. The cheese was nice and melted, with fresh minced onion and topped off with a super sweet pickle. The chicken rings were tasty too. The fries were just plain ol' crinkle cut fries so not anything special.   Fittingly the place is located in Casino Royale, home to the cheapest bar on the strip. I need to make a point to get a good buzz going there before stumbling into white castle. That way I can get the full, well rounded experience.  The FInal Verdict  Pros: White Castle. Better than frozen. In close proximity to the cheapest bar on the strip.  Cons: Marked up prices.  Return Factor: 10/10. I still need to try this place while drunk.",

I feel like when places like this are talked about so much the food is generally mediocre. My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try as a late night snack. We got there around 11 and there was a huge line. The wait was not bad at all though. The line looks long, but they make the burgers pretty quick so it goes by really fast.  I opted for two of their original cheese sliders and they came out really quick. The burgers are really small so I understand why they have such huge combos. I am normally a person who doesn't eat much and I think I could eat about 4 sliders. The patty is really thin and that is what makes the sliders stand out. There was nothing special about them, but they were the perfect late night snack.   I will probably be back here when I am in Vegas and craving a light snack in the middle of the night since they are open 24hrs. I am curious about how their other sliders and fries taste like so I might revisit the next time I visit Vegas in July. With so many food choices near by, White Castle would probably not be the first place that comes to my mind when I want a full meal.  Overall, White Castle is A-OK in my book.",

Whoever is hiring is doing it right. It's also fun to watch the team sling burgers - serious skills and rhythm.   For folks who are new to White Castle:  White Castle sliders are thin hamburger patties cooked in onions sandwiched between very soft white bread. There's a good amount of char flavor thanks to the onions and the high surface area to inside meat ratio. The cheese is American processed cheese.  IMHO, there isn't enough meat on the classic slider to balance out the bread and the double sliders have too much meat.   I recommend the chicken sliders instead. These are fat, glorified chicken nuggets (but better) on the same soft white buns with a slice of cheese. In this case, the ratio is spot on! They're perfectly-sized and priced for a between-meal snack.  Opt for onion chips over fries and dip 'em in zesty sauce. Trust. Pass on the other sides, which taste like food you probably shouldn't be putting in your body.   This is a good place to go if you're hit with The Crave or if you are just nostalgic for those little sliders or if you legitimately love White Castle. If you are just a fast food fanatic whose never had White Castle, it's worth trying once.   On the White Castle scale, this location is a 10/10 for the staff.",

    "text": "Why?  Why? If you can afford not to, don't. I must hate myself. Harold and Kumar were dumber than they looked.  THESE ARE THE POSSIBLE TITLES OF THIS REVIEW.  I came here super hammered trying to have my drunken stupor wear off.  So I was quite out of my mind.  Going here was another example of poor judgment while intoxicated.  I parked in the Venetian and walked a good hike to get find this place.  When I finally found it inside the Casino Royale, there were a lot of people waiting for their food.  I have never had this before, so I asked the lady in the line in front of me if it was really \"that good.\"  She replied, \"Well I grew up on it.  That's why I like it.\"  In most instances, that's not a good sign for newcomers.  It means, \"If I wasn't used to this stuff and didn't have fond memories associated with it already, I sure as heck wouldn't be eating it otherwise.\"  But again, I didn't listen to my intuition because the alcohol was screaming down my cranial highway still, killing any brain cells available that night.  I ordered 10 of these bite size burgers and a 3 piece of this chicken ring thing.  What should have made me leave was the fact that you can see the food as it's being made.  I don't mean the workers cooking.  You can see that.  I mean you can see very clearly what it is you're about to eat BEFORE it's cooked.  Well let me tell you... the so called beef patty was this weird spam colored looking cube kinda sizzling on this flat stove.  It looked as processed as spam or an MRE for our brave military folks reading this.  Well when you're not in war, sacrificing your life, you kinda want a nice meal since you're not about to die.  I got the food, walked the long walk back to the Venetian garage and began my journey home.  I tried very hard to eat this stuff.  Very hard.  I made my way through half the burgers and chicken rings before I tossed the rest.  When you compare mcnuggets or strips to these chicken rings, you at least get a sense that there are chicken remnants in the nuggets or strips.  These chicken rings are more chicken flavored than anything.  It made me a nit nauseous, beyond the liquor, thinking about what I was eating.  I thought to myself that there must be some homeless person who could benefit from this.  But I felt actual guilt if I had to give someone this to nourish themselves.  Basically Ill choose McDs, JintheBox, KFC, Taco Smell, BK, or even Arbys over this place.  Now I realize how pompous and spoiled I sound.  As I was forcing this stuff down my pie hole, I thought to myself, \"Who would choose to eat this stuff on their own volition while not only paying for it, but waiting in a line and waiting after to get it?\"  So I realize how blessed I am to know what better food is and being able to make a choice.  I fully realize most all people don't have a choice or have ever had better.  For that, I am humbled and grateful.  So why the two stars?  Well, good question.  I guess it's relatively cheap and it does have a strong flavor.  Chalk this one up to experience and having checked something off the \"try anything once list.\"  ADVICE:  ORDER JUST ONE AND TRY BEFORE YOU BUY.",

The Original Slider didn't seem that fresh to me but I was surprisingly impressed with the Chicken Slider. It came with cheese and was crispy yet soft. It was great!

Off we went, coming from the club we had heard good about this mystical 24/7 White Castle and after seeing Harold and Kumar we wanted in. So we took orders for our other guests at the hotel and stood in line for what seemed like forever. The restaurant itself was crowded, packed with people and rather dirty with trash and slider containers still on chairs and tables. The line started towards the back end of the register and displayed a crowd of people either looking to the menu, waiting on food or in line to order.  After about a 25 minute wait we ordered two #2 combos and a slider suitcase. Worth it. The food was not that great but hit the spot and I assume is the taste of most if not all White Castles.   Could have been better, not complaining on the worst end but it was good enough for three in the morning!",

This spot is on the Strip (next to Walgreens and the Venetian). It's open 24/7. And they serve alcohol too (duh, it's Vegas!).  The staff are always friendly and nice. When it's packed, it can sometimes take awhile to get your order. But most often, your order comes up pretty quick.  Personally, I always opt for one of the meal deals - usually the one with 4 sliders. Both the fries and fried onion thingys are decent choices.  It's also pretty fun people-watching when you come here at like 3am on a weekend.",

Don't really eat it earlier because hey, I don't want to chance getting sick during my trip. But haven't gotten sick yet!  This place is located inside a small little casino (which I learned has $2 craps tables!) and is open 24/7.  If my husband and I drove to LV we would stop by here on our way home, get like a small party box of 10 or 12 (and some other stuff I love like their jalapeno burger and fish burger) for our drive to treat ourselves.

I wouldn't say these burgers are something you must try in your lifetime, mostly because if you've had a McDonald's cheeseburger, you've had one of these. I will say that due to their small size, they can be a little addicting.   They start with a square mini patty and top it with cheese, onions and a single pickle. They put that between two warm buns and that's it. Don't get me wrong, they are good, just nothing amazing. Ditto for the crinkle cut fries.   What I did think was great, were the chicken rings and onion chips. The chicken rings have a light breading to them and a nice saltiness that make you wanna keep coming back for more. The onion chips are like onion petals, small little slivers of onion, and are pretty addicting as well.   Where this place is severely lacking is customer service. I get it, this is Vegas. I'm certain the staff has dealt with its share of rude customers. But getting condiments for my order was like filling out a credit application. How many? What did you order? Why do you need so many. Look, between my brother and I, we fed a family of 12. We need a TON of ketchup for the 6 in our party under 10 years old.  Also, you know, I wanna sample your sauces!!!! (Ranch is terrible, BBQ is great by the way).  Also, from the woman who took our order, to the guy cleaning the dining area, everyone who worked there seemed depressed or angry (again, it's Vegas).   Anyway, stop in for nothing more than to say you have and for the experience. Don't do it for much else.",

Maybe, you were or weren't drunk enough? These have never been a thing I wanted to eat while drinking and the Vegas location is the only one that serves up alcohol with them. The outcome seems to be on par with birds, mentos and coke, WC is not for faint of heart if you fear onions or massive gas bubbles.    Yes they are steamed little patties of beef or little fried squares of fish and circles of chicken rings but that's what makes them them. You cannot begin to compare these to freezer case burgers, but if that is all you know then that is what you will think they are supposed to be like, its not, they don't have the pickles or enough onion from the freezer,  trust me.   We have been here three times and every time its been close to midnight or later and we have stood in a line of about 5-10 people and it takes about ten minutes to get them. Comparison, I was just home in Kentucky, stood in line at 12:30am in a line of 10 people and cars wrapped around the building. Point is doesn't matter if its Vegas or Louisville where there are a million WC to choose from, there is a line.",

Well on our last trip to Vegas, the stars must of been aligned because it was the time we got to try this famous White Castle. I was going to go and order 10 little sliders for instagram sake, but my bf convinced me otherwise. I was so glad he did because boy were the sliders bad. I couldn't even get past two. The bread was moist like it was soaked into water. The onions were over powering since there wasn't much meat within the sliders.   We couldn't even finish the fries, but the worse part, were the chicken fingers. They were no bad. I wish we didn't order them.   Thanks but no thanks Harold and Kumar! Perhaps it was all done so that the chain can live on! I do not plan on returning in my future. The way they were making the burgers just was not appetizing.",

Crew members created meatless substitutes. (You can just click that cool or useful vote now) Luckily, White Castle now offers vegetarian sliders and I can't think of a better place to indulge than in Vegas. This place is hopping and stays pretty busy 24/7, but the food gets out fast and hot!  Since no trip to Vegas would be complete without at least one walk of shame and one greasy meal, White Castle fits the bill for the meal, the rest is up to you.",

Apparently there's a secret menu! I'm so bummed out I didn't know earlier, next road trip. It wasn't the greatest burger, you have to be drunk to enjoy them, plan sliders with no seasoning.",

Their burgers are the size of Hawaiian rolls, the patty is really thin, no condiments except for a few diced pieces of onions and a slice of pickle, and they come in a paper box. $1.29 for a 2-bite burgers. They tasted like steamed patties but I'm not sure how they're cooked. We also tried the fish sandwich - same size with a slice of cheese and no sauce for $1.89. These tasted better than the burgers but needed some type of sauce. And the fried onion chips were small pieces of deep-fried onions - $2.89 for a regular-sized order. These were good but mainly batter. I've tried White Castle a couple of times now but I can't envision returning anytime soon.",

Pretty decent size place and could need some improvements on the cleanliness of the place.  There use be a long line here when this was new couple of years ago, but now there's none.  There is nothing special about their slider but it's sure it's mouthwatering.  The softness of the bread and the combination of the patty, onion and cheese is very satisfying.  Simplicity is the best and white castle has that!  Service is fast enough.  I ordered the Crave Case which has 30 regular sliders $35.99. I added cheese for an extra $9, my order was ready in less than 10 min.  Staff are nice.  i didn't have any issues with them everytime I come here.  I will keep coming back here whenever i'm in vegas",

I ordered 4 burger sliders and some cheese sticks, and jn True Vegas fashion, they had beer and alcohol readily available. I didn't have to wait long for my order and there was plenty of seating available. The food tasted better that what I was hoping for and I wish I had their brown mustard with me all the time.

There was no wait-time when we arrived on a Friday at 10 AM, but a long line quickly formed behind us. It's on the strip, so you know how busy traffic is.  We got 2 cheeseburger sliders and a fried chicken slider to try out. The cheeseburger slider had really thin unnatural looking patties. They weren't bad-tasting, but it wasn't anything exciting. The fried chicken slider was decent and and somewhat crispy, but still somewhat thin. I think you would need to order a lot to get full of these; and even so, you would be getting full from the bread. Despite their cute individual containers, the sandwiches don't appear very appetizing. This would make for decent drunk food if there weren't so many other better options on the strip.  I actually kind of liked the flavor, but the service and wait-time don't seem to make this place worth it. Service is lackluster and dreadfully slow; the staff look really unhappy to work there. I'm glad I was able to try it, but I don't plan on revisiting anytime soon.",

The fries were the driest fries I've ever had and it wasn't even warm - I was so upset! Even with ketchup, it was overly dry. I then tried their tiny slider with some ketchup, which was better than their dry fries. Skip the fries and order their sliders. This was the first fast food place that wasn't satisfying while drunk.

You get in line of your own free will, if you don't want to wait then go elsewhere. I also will not rate based on comparisons to other fast food empires (in-n-out, shake shack, McDonald's, etc).  What I am basing my rating in is the food. Let me be completely clear here...if you have ever had the frozen, microwaveable grocery store White Castle sliders then be advised that it is EXACTLY the same as what you will get here. Kudos (I guess) to whoever produces the frozen versions available at the grocery stores because they have 100% matched the taste, consistency, texture and quality of the famous White Castle slider. I wouldn't waste my money on that stuff at the market so I certainly would not ever walk in to another White Castle brick & mortar restaurant location. Sorry but there are WAY too many quality options in town to even consider wasting my time, money, or tastebuds on White Castle.",

    "text": "it's been about 10 years since i've eaten at a white castle restaurant (queens blvd, woodside queens, october 2005)... and being somewhat of a drunk i'm a big fan of the microwavable white castle sliders.  a few weeks after the grand opening of the very first west coast location on the las vegas strip, i decided to drop in and give it a shot, seeing that there were no ridiculous lines to be encountered. i stood in line for about 10 minutes, ordered the #2 (4 cheese burger sliders, fries, drink) for just under $10, and waited another 10 minutes to receive my food.  the overall meal was somewhat satisfying, but the food is a bit overpriced, and obviously geared towards tourists. would i recommend any locals go through the trouble of navigating through las vegas blvd. traffic, find a spot at the harrah's parking structure, and take a long walk through the casino to get to white castle? well, i personally wouldn't do it again. i think i'd only eat here again if i was already close by and doing something else. the only advantage to eating here rather than microwaving some white castle sliders that you bought at albertsons is that the buns on the restaurant sliders are fresh, and don't get hard like microwavable variety sometimes do after you take them out of the wrapper... and the restaurant variety comes with a sliced pickle... not that the pickle really adds to the overall taste. but overall, i'd have to say that the microwavable sliders and restaurant sliders still taste identical.",

My wife and I just recently visited this location on the morning of Friday 02/06/2014. We placed our order at the cashier and then head to the soda fountain to fill up our drinks. Before we are finished filling up our drinks, the man (5'8-5'10 with short hair) at the front counter is already calling out our number to pick up our order. I'm already trying my best and hurried up filling up our drinks so I can pick up the order. But within seconds after the first number call, the man at the front counter started to sound impatient and angry when he calls (yelling and screaming) out our number for the second and third time. I'm appreciative that they provide fast service on the orders, but the man really scared us and made us feel forced/rushed, it was very unprofessional!  Note (02/26/2015): This location barely just opened and it's the first location on the west coast, it's already at 2.5 star overall rating on Yelp, it's shameful and embarrassing.",

My friend and I, being locals, drove from Henderson to the strip to try White Castle out. My family is from the east coast so I've experienced it before, but my friend hadn't.  After our long wait, I ordered a combo with 4 sliders, a side, and a drink and I ordered the 10 slider pack to take back home to my grandma. My friend ordered 4 sliders, a side, and a drink. I received my order fairly quickly after ordering.  I ate my food and waited an extra 30 minutes before my friend got his. I order 10 more sliders than he did. He went up 3 times to ask what was taking so long and the guy calling out orders said he had his ticket there and he would call him. Still nothing. He finally went and asked the cooks and they made his sliders right then and there. I don't see what the problem was.  Also, two of my sliders had a pickle and two didn't. The fact that they are already inconsistent is pretty bad.",

So whenever I went on a trip to the East Coast, I tried to make White Castle a must visit place. Unfortunately, it always eluded me, thus making the allure of White Castle that much greater. Even when it made its appearance at the food truck festivals, I opted not to wait in the 3 hour line. so when I heard they opened up a location on the strip, I figured I'd try it once and for all. And no, the Wal-Mart ones don't count. I also understand ones expectations usually does not meet their perception when yearning for so long. Plus I heard it's overrated. So when I tried it, I wasn't surprised it wouldn't live up to the hype. But what I didn't expect was for the frozen Wal-Mart ones to be better. That's right, I said it. I like my microwave sliders better. Maybe they rushed to get all orders out quickly, which is why my order felt on the cool side. i have to say though, I went on a Wednesday night and got my order quickly. So that's a plus right? So to end my review, I'll say it was ok. Worth the hype? Nah. Will I go back? Probably not. Vegas is surrounded by burger joints in the same price range. So I think I'll just check this off my list of places to try and move along.",

So far I've only had the frozen ones which are just \"ok\". Well unfortunately it tasted the same as frozen. Guess that says how good of a job they did with the frozen burgers, but also about how \"meh\" the burger is. I'd imagine the prices are a lot higher at the Vegas location than ones on the east coast, at least I hope so for there sake. They had combos with 2 or 3 sliders and the things are so tiny I wouldn't be surprised if people easily take down 10. I got a single, a double, then split some onion rings (although they werent rings, what? they qere quarters) and chicken rings (which actually were rings). There is way better food on the strip, especially for burgers, but if you go here, I suggest just trying it for a drunking snack, not for a real meal.",

All of my bodily senses tell me I shouldn't like it. I mean, the famous sliders were soggy and tasteless, and yet I came away from it all kinda enjoying the experience. In a way, I can understand the appeal. If you're completely famished, it's easier to stuff yourself with White Castle sliders than with any other fast food burger precisely because of the very traits that make it so unappealing to foodies. Dunno if I'll ever come back, but regardless of all the bad reviews anyone who liked Harold and Kumar owes it to themselves to try the food at least once.",

You did not score at the club.    My friends and I would come to White Castle in HIGH SCHOOL after a night of cruising, boozing (fyi: drinking age was 18 back East--16 if you looked older and cool), schmoozing, and losing.   At 2 AM all night long the place is filled with dudes that have no squeeze box--otherwise they would not be here--you have loser spelled all over you when you step foot in the door.    But after a few White Castles at 25 cents each, 30 cents with cheese it was, and some greasy ass fries--you don't worry about it till the next morning when you wake up alone with Hamburger breath.   Not a place for children, not for the sober, not for anyone looking for a quality hamburger, not a place you take a significant other or any woman unless you want to get dumped fast.

They taste exactly like the ones you find at the frozen section of your local grocery store/7-11 (after they've been defrosted/heated, of course).... even though they're supposed to be *somewhat* more fresh when prepared right away. Really, it's not any different, so I wouldn't make it a point to stop by White Castle when in Vegas, unless you want to try their other items like chicken rings, fries, etc.  If you're planning a visit anyway, the deep fried onion petals are a must as a choice of side! Super crunchy and delicious. I don't know about you, but I always felt awkward biting into an onion \"ring\". These are so much more fun to eat! Just pop those little suckers right into your mouth. I went with somebody who has tried it in New York, and apparently this location doesn't offer everything from the original menu.  The mere thought of horseradish makes me cringe and shiver for irrational reasons, so if you and I share that intense disgust for it, stay away from the zesty zing dipping sauce. Had it by accident without knowing what it was. Blarrrggh!   I'm not an active environmentalist, but I don't litter and am aware of other issues relating to the matter, so it did sort of break my heart to toss out so much cardboard boxes that only served as brief housing for such dinky sliders :( But I suppose that it's because they are very delicate, and typical wrappers would've squashed them.",

My girls and I checked it out after a night of club hopping--and this food is perfect for that sort of situation. I HATE onions, but was so tired I ended up eating them anyway. The burgers weren't horrible, but they weren't amazing either. I know that folks say they're like Krystal's burgers, but I liked them better...although I couldn't tell you the last time I had anything from Krystal's.  All in all, the restaurant wasn't great, but being able to experience it during an awesome Vegas vacay made it worthwhile.",

Since we were staying on the strip for a 3 day staycation we planned on finally trying White Castle and cross it off our list. Personally I have had no urge to try this popular east coast chain but the hubby was adamant in trying it at least once. Ummmm NO, not going back. Lol.   After trekking the unforgiving 110 degree Vegas heat from the Flamingo, we arrived at the very well lit White Castle space inside the Casino Royale. The area is decorated modestly and everywhere you looked was clean hence the extra star because reality is, all I can give for the quality food wise is 1 star.  We ordered 2 cheese slider combos ($8.99 each) which consisted of: 4 cheese sliders, regular size fries and a drink; Large order of the onion chips ($2.99) the buy 'em by the sack which had 10 original sliders. All that set us back $32+ after the 10% local discount they gave us. The first couple of bites were okay but it was downhill after that, I had 3 sliders and I was fighting to down it. The middle was somewhat soggy which was very unsettling, the taste is indescribable but not in a good way. The fries and onion chips have nothing going on for them either, nothing to write home about. My daughter who likes cheeseburger barely finished one, my husband had the same sentiments, after his third one he was done. My son is the only one that liked it. I told him he can come with his cousins if the mood strikes him because there is no way you can ever bring me back here, it's just not worth the calories. White Castle, check, on to the next adventure.",

    "text": "White Castle had been on my bucket list for years. When I heard they recently opened a location in Vegas my smile grew big as I bookmarked it and forgot about it for a few months. We decided to head out to Vegas last weekend sporadically and I knew I had to find it on the strip and try it. Luckily, without planning our hotel was not too far from the White Castle that we stumbled upon our first night in town casino hopping. It is located inside the Royale Casino, which was another amazing find (cheap drinks), but that will be another review.    We got in a long line and waited eagerly. We ordered a number 9 which included 20 original sliders and 2 regular French fries for $25.99. We added cheese and the total was around $35. Amanda took our order. She was patient, polite, and informative on our questions. Give Amanda a raise. We took our booty back to our room and began to pig out after a long night. I was surprised to bite into pickles on the burgers. Prior, I had only tried the frozen White Castle burgers, no pickles came on them. After the two of us devoured all we could we quickly realized that we had ordered way too much food for two people. There were MANY burgers left over. I am glad I checked this one off my list, and didn't have to travel to the East Coast to do so. It was not the best food but for being hungry in Vegas it hit the spot.  *The french fries were not good at all. Wish we had tried another side instead.",

My experience with them to this point had been buying their frozen burgers they sell across the country in most grocery stores (which I really enjoy).   I have to say that there wasn't much difference between the fresh restaurant product and the frozen product. I even think that I am slightly fonder of the frozen one. Also the added benefit of there being no drunk people stumbling around the freezer section of your local Walmart gives getting the frozen burgers a leg up on visiting this location which is in the middle of the Casino Royale (a fun but slightly shady casino on the north end of the strip).   Burgers were okay, fries were okayish, and prices were average. White Castle ended up being a luke warm purgatory like experience.",

So while I could knock them for the fries, it's a White Castle and it was a WC experience    The line wasn't long, the wait for the food was alright and the burgers were as good as any. They don't serve win mustard and ketchup but when you have such a massive operation as the LV location you make allowances.   Kudos for a great \"dinner\".

There's a casino right next to you also, but the entire location is pretty run down because it's one of the older areas of the strip that's still left.  When we finally got to the front after like 20 minutes we ordered the Crave Case which comes with 30 sliders, which is cool if you have a bunch of people with you. The cashier asked if we wanted cheese and we decided to only do half with cheese. Turns out it's an extra $5 just to do half with cheese! He didn't even warn us it was going to be more, but I guess we should have assumed it. There's honestly nothing too special about the actual slider. All I can say is that it tastes pretty damn good.  All in all, I love White Castle but this location sucks. I guess it's cool if you want the sliders fresh, but it doesn't make that much of a difference.

It opened on January 27th, 2015; and it was the very 1st time in 56 years that a White Castle has expanded in a different state.   The 1st time I ever had a White Castle slider was back in the 90's when Costco used to sell them in their freezer section.  I didn't even know that they were a fast food chain since there weren't any in the West Coast.  After Costco stopped selling these, I never heard of White Castle again until the film \"Harold & Kumar Goes to White Castle\" was released in 2004.  Ever since I saw that movie, I've always had a craving for White Castle.  When I went to New York in 2008, it was the very 1st time that I ever dined at a White Castle establishment.   When I went to Las Vegas in 2015, I was pleasantly surprised to see this White Castle since they've only had their restaurants in the mid-West & the East Coast.  I had to give them a try!  This is a cleaner White Castle than their other locations, and it was fun to sit by the window and \"people-watch\" the folks walking on the strip.  As for the food.., it's your typical White Castle.  Small portions & very greasy.  You always have to order more sliders than you think, if you just have a normal appetite; and even more sliders if you're really hungry!  What makes this White Castle unique is that they serve breakfast items from 5am - 11am, and they also sell cold draft beer.   It's a good place to get cheap food at any hour of the day/night.  In the past, the only place to get 24/7 fast food was at McDonald's.  It's a novelty to finally have a White Castle in the West Coast; but at the end of all things.., it's still just a fast food chain.  It's just nice to have another alternative than the McDonald's on the Las Vegas strip.",

    "text": "I live in Georgia, where we don't really have White Castle restaurants.  We do have something called Krystal, which sells small sized boxed burgers too but all the northern transplants down here (which are annoyingly plentiful) always say White Castle is so much better and they always wax nostalgic about growing up devouring their burgers.  I'm not a fan of Krystal either, so I believed them.    The only White Castle burgers I'd ever tasted were the refrigerated, microwavable ones you buy at the grocery store.  They were bland, but I gave the transplants the benefit of the doubt.  After all, the microwavable sandwiches probably didn't taste like the real thing.    Fast forward to March 23, 2016:  I'm on vacation in Las Vegas and I'm staying at the Casino Royale Hotel.  There happens to be a White Castle restaurant right here in my hotel!  It was late at night, I was starving after a long day of just having fun on the Strip without eating anything.  Just about anything would have been delicious to me at the time.  I walked in, ordered their $9.99 package (which includes 4 small cheeseburgers, fries and a soft drink) and immediately took it back to my room.    A previous poster here, named Leanne L., summed it up perfectly:  It tasted no different from the microwavable White Castle burgers you get at the supermarket.  And the fries were only slightly better.  After all these years of having northerners tell me how great White Castle is, I was disappointed.  It sucked when the best part of my meal was the Coca Cola I drank.    I guess the northern transplants will tell me that since the restaurant I went to was located in Vegas, it was just a bastardized version of White Castle and not the one they grew up eating.  We all know Sin City likes to replicate themes from other places, but I doubt this is the case here.  I doubt I'll eat there again unless I'm just desperately hungry and don't feel like walking all over the Strip to go somewhere else.  I do admit that their chocolate cheesecake on a stick looked good on the menu, but I didn't try that.    I give them good marks for having friendly cashiers and quick service even though the place was crowded.  But I was there for the food and it really wasn't much different from Krystal.  Little, bitty tasteless burgers with cheese, diced onions and no tomatoes.",

As I was walking the strip looking for a place to eat, I stumbled across it and decided I might as well try it. I ordered a variety of things: onion rings, chicken nugget like things and two sliders.  Onion rings, unfortunately these were the highlight of my meal....they were the best tasting thing I ordered and even then they were just okay.  The chicken nuggets tasted very stale and were pretty small too. For reference I am a fan of McD's nuggets.  The sliders were bad. They tasted like meat paste covered in onion inside a bun. I cringed while eating them and so did the friend I was with.  At least their service is nice though?",

Since they do not have this chain down south, where I stay, I had not been able to taste it.  Until one day, I was driving by the vegas strip and noticed it tucked deep in the sidelines of the Casinos.  After some tricky parking, and a long trek I was finally at the register ordering the cheese slider meal.  At first glance, everything seemed good, heck it sure did make for a great instagram post, which is mandatory for me on all food I eat.  After the first bite, I was left unimpressed.  I would easily rank Fatburger and In and out above this chain and even Mcdonalds.  It was definitely great to finally try it but would not go out of my way to do it again.",

Now for the food, we got the combo meal that comes with 4 white castle cheeseburgers, cringly fries and a drink. Fries were good but the burger was just ok. Nothing to get excited about. They are very small with a very thin slice of meat and a ton of onions with pickles. If you love these two veggies then I think you will love the burgers.

I am so disappointed that the burgers were watery, like they were frozen and not cooked all the way. The sliders filled me up quickly, but it was not satisfying. Definitely really expensive and not worth the price.  Dont expect to have that amazing experience there, unless you are super drunk or high and dont care what you put in your mouth. Fries were ok.",

You get a lot of food in your meal but it taste like your average fast food that you can easily get from any fast food restaurant. Some of the employees seem very impatient but you can't really expect much from a fast food restaurant that's always packed. It is worth the experience in Vegas to say the least. If I'm starving at 3 or 4 in the morning with no other option the next time I visit Vegas, I might give it a second chance?",

Would I try again, why not but I wouldn't expect outstanding at all.   Onion strips were okay. Staff was polite and kind and had me on my way with combo #2 in no time (4 cheeseburgers, onions or fries plus drink).  Place is located on the east wall of the Casino Royale which I think they took some space from a Denny's that use to be there or might still be there.   Security is there to keep people from cutting a very long line.  My experience was walking in and was asked by a guard if I just got there, I said yes and then he asked me to get in line but there was no long line, I asked him which line? He then said oh, another guard just said go ahead sir. Line was actually 5 deep at the time and not out the door to the strip like some mentioned.",

The line was long and took me 10 minutes to order and another 10 minutes to get my food.   When I got my food, I was disappointed. In no way did that resemble a burger slider. The bottom bun was so soggy that it stuck to the packaging. The burger patty was probably 3 millimeters thick. It came with one pickle and grilled onions. The fries were soggy as well and tasted like plastic. The fries tasted like they were frozen and reheated in a microwave. To top it off, the food was not worth the money. It costs almost $10 for a slider combo (drink, fries, 3 slider). I paid $1.30 for each slider that you could finish in 2 bites. The best part of the meal was the drink.  The food here closely resembles the frozen, microwaved lunch you get in elemenatry school. One star because it is open 24/7.",

Ended up getting the 20-pack with two fries. Add cheese to them and it's a little extra. Also ordered some mozzarella sticks. Total came to just under $40. If you buy the slider packs, it would be cheaper than buying 2 or 3 meals that come with maybe 3 sliders and a drink and fries. Up to you what you wanna do.  It's good to try.

    "text": "For over 30 years I've been hearing about White Castle sliders from those that lived in, or traveled to parts of the country that offered them. Then, after Harold and Kumar made their movie, I truly hoped that one day I would travel to a place in the mid west or eastern parts that had a White Castle Burger joint, or even better, I wished that White Castle would open a store here in Southern California. Sadly, no luck either way. Then voila! I saw them in the frozen section of my local super market. I bought a pack, took them home and immediately nuked a few in the microwave. Not bad I thought to myself. They had a unique flavor with kind of an onion tang. Nevertheless, these were frozen burgers. I knew the freshly made ones had to be better, so I withheld final judgement, and continued to hope for a real experience at a White Castle location.  Fast forward several years and I'm walking the strip in Las Vegas and the White Castle sign hit my like a ton of bricks! There it  was! Boom! A real deal White Castle burger joint right here in Las Vegas, and right in front of me! I dragged the wife into the place and immediately placed an order for sliders, fries and a drink. So let me get this out of the way first, I don't like krinkle fries. And, the White Castle krinkle fries were no different than any other krinkle fries I've tried. So what did I think of the sliders? They were really tasty and much better than the frozen ones, as I expected them to be. These are truly unique sliders. They are steamed with the onion on the patties. I think that's part of what makes them distinctive.  Now, if I'm only judging the slider, in the context of the fast food world of large or popular burger chains, I give it 5 stars considering the under $2 price. I don't smoke weed, but if I did, I could see myself eating a bag of these little morsels after smoking a bowl, just like Harold and Kumar did in the movie.   The slider is the only thing that stood out. Again, I didn't care for the fries, and everything else was just okay. Service was decent, drink fountain was nothing special. Over all, 4 stars for White Castle, mostly because of their famous sliders.",

I live in Los Angeles now and when  go back to visit family in NY, I usually grab a few White Castle in The Bronx and get that great White Castle taste I grew up with.  Last week I went to this Las Vegas location and I'm sad to say I was disappointed in the food.  First of all, $3.59 for a double burger is just way over priced!  The White Castle locations I visit in NYC charge about $1.89 for a double.  I guess it being located on the strip is why the high cost?  I did notice the menu was a little different.  I don't think I saw fish sandwiches and I didn't see any fried clam strips.  And I'm fine with those menu differences.  I did like the onion sticks instead of the usual onion rings.    My biggest issue was the flavor of the burgers.  They just don't taste as good as the White Castle I'm used to.  Despite them being made fresh at this location, they still taste similar to those terrible frozen ones you buy at the supermarket.   It's too bad because I was really excited to have a location out west.",

I wanted to get these because it's been about 20 years since I moved to California where there are no White Castles. I almost forgot about this business until Harold and Kumar came along and I got the frozen ones a few times a year. I actually liked their sliders as a kid...obviously they look much tinier now.  Anyway, we didn't like them enough to eat the 8 we got (I consider 4 of them as an equivalent to one normal burger) We took it back to our hotel room and I chucked the remainder in the freezer....I got hungry the next day and decided to microwave one up for 40 seconds....Maybe it's just me, but it tasted better after the freezer.  For those people complaining about the patty's color, it's because of the way it's made, doesn't mean the meat is inferior (most fast food patties are all roughly the same quality). They lay down the minced and semi cooked onions on the flat cooking area, cook and reduce the juices a bit, then lay the frozen patties on top of the onions, then they lay the bread on top and let the onion steam cook the patty, thus the gray color. Meat only gets brown if it's directly on the cooking surface.",

    "text": "White Castle was in Las Vegas as a food truck during the Las Vegas Foodie Fest previous years and the line for it was un-fricken-believable. Reportedly, people waited long hours for the infamous tiny sliders. I didn't wait for it personally, but I did see the extreme amount of people in line as I was exploring other (and better) food options. And now it's here not as a mobile restaurant, but an actual restaurant, hidden away in the Casino Royale.   To find it, you need to walk a little bit, so make time for that. I don't mind playing tourist in my own city every now and then, but lemme tell ya, for White Castle? Not worth it!  The little sliders are, at best, just cute. The meat was dry and it didn't help that the regular sliders were like 90% buns and meat. There were onions and pickles on it but it seemed like 2 little tiny pieces of diced onions, and a pickle the size of a dime. I prefer the cheese sliders over the regular ones.  About 5-6 sliders can fill me up really good on a hungry day, so order accordingly. The way they fill up the beer with the magnet is pretty cool! :) Oh, and perks, 10% off for locals with a local ID!  I'd say this place isn't really worth the hassle to get... maybe a good place to stop by when you're playing tourist in your own city, but that's about it.",

I ordered a bunch of cheese sliders and original sliders to bring back to the hotel for my group of friends. Needless to say, my first White Castle slider will probably be my last White Castle slider. There was nothing special about it, and I definitely was not impressed.

I personally think the frozen ones are better than the ones I had yesterday from the new location on the strip.  At 2AM we still waited at least 15 minutes.  All we ordered were regular burgers.  You could see they were rushing to complete orders and voila when we got our 8 sliders they were not very good.  3 of 8 had no pickles (we did not order them that way) and on all of them the onions were still mostly raw and overpowering.  Overall, based on the visit, I will not return.  Considering the frozen ones cost abo.ut 50 cents each from Costco or when they are on sale at the grocery store, why go to the strip to pay double for an iconic slider that didn't taste all that great with mostly raw and overpowering onions.  This is a post script:  I just came home from Sam's Club where I purchased 18 White Castle Cheeseburgers for about $11 and they are way better than the sliders we got on the strip a few weeks ago.",

Only reason I went back was because my friend had never tried them before and he will agree when he said \"that food was pretty wack.\" After waiting over 10 minutes to get our food, (which was to be expected as I learned from my first visit since they can be pretty busy at times) our fries were cold and stale. I was so hungry though that I ate my 5 sliders before going back up to the counter to tell them about the fries. The manager tells me \"you ordered almost 20 mins ago and now you tell me about the fries?...of course they're cold\". Yeah we ordered 20 minutes ago, we hadn't had our food for 20 mins. I could not believe the audacity of this idiot. I told her they were cold and stale when she gave them to us and I wasn't going to argue with a fast food employee. As a manager she should've been accommodating especially since we just spent close to $30. I told her she could keep her fries, left them on the counter, and left. White Castle food is trash and their management reflects their product. I will NEVER waste my $$ or time there again.",

My 11 yr old grand daughter can eat that and more because the burgers are so small. .I paid $15 plus some change for that combo plus 4-burgers.  That was my usual order after the club in Chicago and Minneapolis.  It  cost me $6 plus some change for the same order the last time I had them in Minneapolis.  I have not lived here that long so I have recently had white castles.  Just because it is on the strip that should not make such a big difference.  That is just pure greed!!!  if they open a store off the strip and the prices are within reason I would patronize that store but not on the strip ever again.  It is so sad that companies are so greedy, you people make enough profits give us a break.  This is why I am only giving one star and I hope others follow suit.",

Really? The burgers here don't even compare to the frozen boxed ones, and are not even in the same ball park of the traditional ones from NY. They tasted horrible! And in NY they never had pickles on them, where did that come from? In NY we jokingly called them belly bombs, out here they truly are! My stomach hurt for 2 days after eating this crap.

The order came with four cheese burger sliders. While I was waiting I saw how they were cooking and assembling the burgers. The meat was frozen and came in thin squares. Bunch of people were working there just assembling away. They didn't look like they were happy working there.   The way the burgers were cooked and assembled, I feel that they can automate the whole process with machines and eliminate the whole work force. That was how I felt the burgers tasted. Did not have any depth or feel any \"love\" from the burgers.",

Light little pillows of bun holding together meat, cheese, grilled onions and a pickle or two!  My life is now complete, unless there are other food apocalyptic type events waiting to happen.   The fries were great! Just wished we would have gotten one more, as the reg size is meant for one person, I believe.  Onion petals were good as well.   As for the chicken and fish sliders; I think these were good, but would rather have the originals instead.  I attached a pic of the aftermath!  This joint is Jake Approved!",

The meat doesn't taste like meat, the buns are thin and boring, there's hardly any toppings or anything to it... If you get dragged here by someone else in your group, the one thing I would recommend would be the \"onion chips\" sort of like onion petals from Arby's. Tastes like an onion ring but in flower petal shape. I didn't try the desert, but I can't imagine they'd be able to mess up a chocolate dipped slice of cheesecake.   This location is conveniently attached to a casino with a few other foods options. They offer bar seating and a few tables, but the location is on the small side. They did not seem to have an attached restroom, you would have to go into the casino area. I'm giving 3 stars for cleanliness but I'd give 1 for the actual food.",

There's very little sitting and just be really friendly with other diners.  We sat near a gentleman from LA in town for a concert. We chatted before his food came out. He bought one of everything on the menu which I realized was accurately smart. He ate his food and didn't even touch his bacon cheese fries, he was so full he gave us the bacon cheese fries.  We were so full after we left and it pays to be friendly with neighboring people.  We had a number #7  ten sliders pack, cheese was a $3 up charge.  I think I had 5 little cheese sliders they had pickles and onions.  It was a surprise they have a 10% locals discount!!!  Now serving breakfast MIDNIGHT until 11 AM!!!",

I don't know if they still have long lines since people know it's not the best lol The burgers were tiny and had very little taste to them, which I assume it's how it is in where it came from. It was very expensive for what you got to be honest. It was not good at all, way way over price. Like In-n-Out is better lol The kitchen where you can see them cooking the burgers is very unsanitary looking. There were buns everywhere, chopped onions on the floor, not to mention their was pretty brown lol DO NOT WORRY IF YOU HAVEN'T GONE THERE, YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING.  Pros:...umm they have really good chicken rings?  Hope this helps.

I know it's on the Strip and I expected it to be packed so that wasn't a problem.  I went here a second time and this is why I won't ever be back. After waiting in line for 20 minutes I finally ordered a dozen burgers to go. I don't care for onions so I ordered those burgers without them and the lady repeated that. I waited several more minutes for them to come out--my mistake was not checking them in the restaurant. I drove all the way home only to find out these burgers had been completely caked in onions. After scraping off a massive amount of onions, reheating the burgers and having my meal I decided to call the restaurant to inform them of their mistake. I was surprised when no one answered. I tried a few more times. Nothing. The next day I tried calling and still nothing. So I left a voicemail with my contact information. I waited a few days and received no type of reply back. At this point I gave up. If they can't even reply to a customer then they don't deserve my business. White Castle can be good but this location has a big ego being the only one in Vegas. If you do encounter a problem you will have to personally go in and inquire about it. No one cares enough to call back. Just a forewarning.",

Las vegas finally gets with the program and White Castle learns a lesson in economics (you go where your rabid fans are). yes it's a square, little hamburger. Yes, it was copied by some Schmuck named Krystal  from the south who claims he had the idea when visiting St Louis World fair..     Some people pay premium dollar to say they have an iPhone, some people pay a price to eat a small, square burger that has its onions and buns steamed with the burger...    This one serves beer...

    "text": "Having been dubbed as 'gut bombers' by friends from the Midwest, I should have known better not to dive straight into the pits of hell.  Unfortunately, the term still holds True despite of being in this side of the country!  Engorged 3 sliders and things began to go downhill from there.  I'd like to keep this review as clean as possible so look up reviews on Amazon regarding sugar-free Haribo gummy bears to give you a better idea of what actually went down.  If this were your first time, consider yourself warned and eat at your own risk!  After hearing about the grueling wait in line for the past several days following its grand opening, we came in around 4 o'clock Sunday morning thinking there wouldn't be anyone in the establishment.  Instead, we walked in to one of the worst mistakes we've done in awhile.  To our surprise, the place itself was swarming with drunk people from nightclubs around the area.  It almost felt like a nightmare coming in sober; as if someone was about to get shot/stabbed at any moment.  At least you can get $1 beers from the bar right across the fast food joint to help you get acclimated with the whole scene if you happen to find yourself in the same situation.    We ended up waiting for over 50 minutes just to order and another 15 to get our food.  The sliders were just as good when I had it in Chicago.  For those having it for the first time, however, they're fairly similar from what you can get at Costco.  This might even be worse as they were rather cold once I started eating them.  Overall, White Castle is definitely bringing in the masses for their infamous sliders.  As much as I'd like not to come back at this establishment, I can see my inebriated self lining up in the near future just to get a hold of their greasy sliders to help soak up the alcohol.",

    "text": "11 years! That's how long it has been since Harold and Kumar made such a fuss about these tiny burgers, and how long I have been waiting to find out if it was worth it.  Spoiler: It kind of is.  The meat is really nothing special here.  It looks preformed from frozen (I could be wrong, but just my observation) and it very thin.  What makes this joint stand out is everything else in addition to the location.  The burgers grill on a flat top coated with onions to soak in flavor.  They are simply made with a couple leftover onions and a pickle, plus cheese if you pay extra.  No frills needed, or really requested for that matter.  The other options I tried were pretty basic type fast food, so nothing special I would go back for.  This location is 24/7 right on the Vegas strip and whether it was noon after a night of drinking, or 4am during a night of drinking - this place is gold! 4 bite burgers that are pretty cheap, freshly made in front of you and aren't super heavy.  I chowed down on 5 of them easily feeling satisfied without feeling sick the next day or really even feeling regret from eating anything overly greasy or poor quality.  In a regular fast food setting it would be just that to me.  A quick bite when I don't really care about what I'm eating the way most fast food is.  On the Vegas strip however, this is probably my new favorite stop during the night or before I get some sleep!",

Even a hamburger at nasty McDonald's would be cheaper and more flavorful. The sliders are literally the size of a half dollar coin, and takes less than a bite to eat. Like you read in the other reviews, the meat is paper thin, our sliders had barely any grilled onions in it, and the bread was soggy. It tasted like literally paper. If it was actually the same prices of the east coast white castles then I could see the appeal in getting filled by buying like a million sliders for cheap although you're wasting it on eating a pile of flavorless junk.",

Unless you are walking on the strip, it takes quite an effort to get to the restaurant since you have to go through people and traffic, park at a casino, then walk down the strip to eat here.   When it comes to waiting, the time you wait in line to order is a lot longer than the time to get your food. My friend and I ordered #9, 3 cake on a stick, chicken rings, and onion chips. Literally, right after we ordered it took about 30 seconds for us to get all of our food.   The quality of the food is disappointing and it might be because of how busy they are. The sliders weren't anything great and their fries are not crispy at all. Their chicken rings didn't have much flavor in them either. However, their onion chips and cheesecake on a stick were amazing.  Their service is a lot better than I assumed. The worker who took my order was extremely kind, patient, and helpful. Everyone looks like they're trying their best to work as quickly as possible to meet every customer's needs.  To be honest, White Castle is okay but it just wasn't for me. The food isn't worth the wait like people think it'd be.",

The combination of cheap and small makes you want to come back for more. Unfortunately you will need to order quite a few in order to feel full. Sometimes simple is better. There is no glamour to these burgers. The restaurant is full of people with happy smiles. Unfortunately the location needs to be cleaned more often after people eat at the tables.",

Do not come here expecting to have a burger your way with 86 options to choose from, you can venture down the strip if you want to spend 40 bucks on a gourmet burger. This place is serious business here, they have A LOT of employees working in assembly lines preparing burgers, refilling soda machines, stocking up on ketchup, cleaning up as soon as a vacant seat is available, calling out numbers with video screen assistance like the DMV, organized chaos at its finest. The line stayed long, it moved quickly, and the staff was great. I got the cheese sliders, and being a cheese lover I do not think I would enjoy burger as much without it. The fries were mediocre, but probably taste better with toppings. Overall this is a great late night munchies spot and I am sure to return.",

First issue is the fact they don't add ketchup like they do at all white castles.  I had to tear all of my burgers apart to add ketchup which being sliders was cumbersome.  Even the guy I complained to who is from NJ said \" we don't do that, even though all of the other ones do it\".  Second issue was the quality.  The burgers weren't fully cooked, since the patties are so thin, this is very hard to screw up.  Third issue was the fries.  They were much thinner and far less quantity than the normal white castles.  Fourth issue was the very loud intercom, they yell almost every 15 seconds your order numbers.  This interrupts the dining experience and hurt my ears.  If you want the real white castle experience I highly suggest you skip this horrible excuse for a white castle and go to an established one.",

I thought, \"wow, it must be really good.\" I relied on regular tv news and drunk friends instead of reviewing  yelp comments to help me decide if I was going to eat there and I paid the price. The taste of the meat was bland and the bread was like store bought buns. Really did not taste anything to make it stand out. I kept thinking I should have just gone to the store and bought the kings Hawaiian Sweet Bread and some burger meat and made my own.  I did like the loaded fries. They were tasty but the serving size was small. Bright spot, i like how security tried to keep the line moving and safe.",

We don't have many options in Vegas for Sliders so this could be a main destination on your list. Location is kind of goofy and not very accessible to the local folk would like to grab a quick bite. You have to find some where to park on the strip and walk which is fine, but like I stated quick bite it isn't happening. Now to the food, Burgers are pretty decent no onions for me, but the onion flavor is echoing off the bun which gives it that classic White Castle aroma. Instead of hard microwave buns now they are soft and fresh and the burger is made right in front of me instead of in a factory  which makes it a plus. Now to the best item at White Castle the Chicken Rings. It reminded me of the old recipe Chicken Nuggets at BK. Reminded me of my childhood which resulted in yet another plus. Overall good spot for the Tourists and the tipsy crowd walking by.",

This is my first time trying White Castle and I really wanted to see what the hype was all about, but I was so disappointed. The beef patty is so thin you are basically eating steamed buns with pickles and cheese. The onion fries I got tasted how I expected it to taste, basically cut up onion rings. Glad I finally got to try this after so many years, but basically one and done for me.",

    "text": "My boyfriend & I have been waiting since our last Vegas trip for this to open!  Finally, a White Castle for us to try that is not frozen!  We ordered:  #7 - 10 original sliders (add cheese), 2 regular soft drinks, 2 regular French fries (one of them = cheese fries).  It sounds like a lot, but for 2 really hungry people, it is a cake to finish because the sliders are small.  Each slider comes with onions & pickles (I did not realize this until I took my first bite -__-)  The food is good & it is a perfect drunk meal for when you are finished clubbing because it open 24/7! Fudge-dipped Cheesecake - Nothing extraordinary.  Customer service could have been better.  Several of us were looking at the menu & deciding & the cashiers kept on asking if we were ready.  Also, considering how much food my boyfriend & I ordered, they only gave us 3 ketchups...  My boyfriend went back to ask for more & the workers gave him 2, then I went back to ask for more & I got 3.  Pretty shady!",

I tried the chicken sandwich the second time I came here to try something different . Pretty basic small sliders to get the job done and fill you up late at night . The fries are okay in my opinion . Now with the new in n out opening close to the linq that's a more likely spot for me when I got vegas. Good to try one time my yelpers :)",

For a family of 3, it was me, my wife & our 3 year old, i ordered the 4 cheeseburger sliders combo and extra 2 cheeseburger slider. I thought it was enough for us, but I had to order a few more lol.  For me its best to eatitwhen it is still warm, everything just melts in ur mouth, and im craving for it right now again while writing this review.  I ordered a $5 chocolate shake too and that was also good!  Their service is really fast and food quality is great, that is why for me, they deserve a 5-star rating.  At the time that we were there, there was a good amount of people.  When I paid for my food they gave me a number, i went to go get my drink, a minute or two after, they called my number right away, so i was very satisfied.  Its a small dining area, so It might be a little hard for you if you come here when there is a lot of people.  When I come back to Vegas, I would definitely come back here.",

We got 4 cheeseburger sliders with a drink and fries and it was $8.99.  The sliders were pretty gross. I think some frozen sliders even taste better. The bread were soggy on the bottom as if my bun was accidentally dropped in water. What makes it worse is its not water but the bun soaked up the fat juice from the meat (which some may like but a soggy bun, no thank you). The meat looked old and not fresh at all. One picture that a fellow yelper posted says it all.   Service was ok. Some were super nice while some looked as if they just crawled out of bed or have a bad hangover. Definitely a one time visit for me. Never again.",

The lines are seriously puzzling... is there a secret menu I'm not aware of?!  On the most recent, the hubs wanted to try the chicken rings.  It's a rip off.

So I came in here around 2pm on Sunday, and it was fairly busy. The staff was all helpful and friendly, and they got my order correct and ready in good time. The place itself is pretty clean, and the lady walking around the dining area was nice enough to clear away the trash on my table.  As for the food, you need to remember that it's FASTFOOD. Don't expect gourmet sandwiches or sliders, or even compare to In n Out. It's simple food. I got myself 10 cheeseburger sliders and loaded fries. In all honesty, the food was better than when I had it in Jersey. Fries were nice and crisp(I normally hate crinkle fries), slider bun was steamed nicely so it was very soft with fresh onions. The flavor was satisfying and hit the spot. I'm thinking about going to the grocery store to buy some microwaveable sliders just thinking about Vegas!",

Location: This place is located on the strip near the Palazzo Hotel and right next to Walgreens. It's right across the street from The Mirage and Treasure Island.   Parking: You're gonna have to park at a nearby hotel and walk over if you aren't already staying at them because it is located directly on the strip.  Menu: Pretty straight forward. Original or Cheese Sliders. They serve beer on tap! How awesome is that?! Lol You can also buy meal packages, sets of 30, 100 lol  Boyfriend and I opted for 10 cheese sliders and 5 original to compare and we heard they were small.   ** TIP- You will not like these sliders if you do not like onions. I only like onions if they're cooked or caramelized or depending on my mood. I know I'm weird. Lol  I had low expectations going into this place despite reading other reviews. The cheese sliders wasn't too bad. I would eat it again. The cheese was so gooey and blended well with the onions and meat party. The original one was just too plain. The cheese definitely makes it taste 10x better. I don't recommend the original ones at all. The also come in cute little boxes.   This place would definitely be great drunk food lol but it's not amazing but it's not bad either! I just can't see myself craving it all the time.   Check this place out at least once so you can say you tried it!",

They sell them frozen in the Supermarkets, but they are NOT the same... perhaps 6/10.  Closest White Castle franchise is actually located in Las Vegas.  It was good, but not as good as the ones in N.Y.  I think they charge like a buck fifty for 1 slider.    If you are listening White Castle Corporate, please open some up in San Diego, California!!!",

    "text": "Well, I finally made it to a White Castle.  It is what it is and it doesn't try to be anything more.  And that's basically how a 24-hour food joint on the strip should be.  Be noted that I came here right after having a Filet Mignon at Mon Ami Gabi, so I really came in here with lower expectations.  I like cheeseburgers so I went with their Castle Combo No. 2 which had 4 cheeseburgers, fries, and a drink (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1d7fHzH&s=a8a63496f4157fbd83e29ef7e7d8b26579893853fa4c1875507a0f3fb01bdb31\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1d7fHzH</a>).  I can describe these little cheeseburgers in two words:  Salt Bombs!  These little suckers were pretty damn salty.   I think after every bite I just keep going for my soda to soak it all up.  Despite the saltiness, the cheeseburgers weren't that bad!  But it might be because I had some alcohol beforehand.  And definitely better than getting them frozen ones at the supermarket.  For just under $10, the combo was decent.  Luckily when I arrived to White Castle at around 10:30pm, there wasn't a line to order.  So my experience was pretty quick as it should be.  But when I walked by at around midnight, the place was super packed so I was glad that I just had beat the late night munchie rush.  Amazing!  Despite the novelty, I don't know if I'd come back to White Castle again.  If I want a burger on the Strip late at night, there are plenty of other options at around the same price range.",

The beauty of the strip is that you could be eating gourmet burgers from super star chefs one day and sliders from the freezer section of your local grocery store the next. As expected we ordered a bunch of stuff like original sliders, cheese sliders, onion rings, curly fries, chicken nuggets etc. The onion rings and chicken nuggets were outright nasty. Do yourself a favor and stay clear of those. The sliders specially the cheese slider was surprisingly very good. The buns were nice and soft without any sogginess. The pickles, cheese and patties came together very well. I chomped on six of these bad boys with ease so definitely order a bunch of them to fill you up.  What I like about White Castle is that it does not try to be something that it is not. It is located opposite to one of the seediest dive bars that you will find on the strip and below a dumpy hotel both of which I have had the good fortune of sampling. Been there, done that, have no intention of repeating.",

Well I can say, \"If you didn't grow up with White Castle, then you'll probably NEVER understand the sensation of biting into one of these heavenly sliders!\"  Just keep in mind, they're NO comparison to a normal burger like In-n-Out.  So believe me, I'm McLovin' all the negative reviews.  Yes they're cute tiny little burgers and can be eaten in four bites.  But that soft steamy bun with a little bit of chopped onions, pickles, and melted cheese (or without) are just the best!  Not as healthy as a four start chain Habit Burger, or as beefy as Five Guys, but more of an \"if I had a fast food burger choice\" of a burger chain;  I'd choose the Dub C!  I mean, they made a movie out of it!  Plus I grew up with them in St. Louis, so it's a personal choice!      Located in the Casino Royale, and the only location in the west coast;  It's conveniently sitting between Fat Tuesday and Walgreens.  And thank goodness for being 24/7, as it's a great pre- or post-party snack!    Regarding service, it's fast food, not fine dining.  Luckily I had no issues with service, but what do you expect?  Just order and scarf them down!",

I've been to a White Castle before in the Bronx of NYC wile on tour being that is the only other time I've actually had their food you so know that we are going here especially late night after a few drinks!  Being from California we don't have White Castles anywhere around so we go to In In Out and it's always just magically delicious and what we crave!  The burgers here were soggy but I think it's because they steam them overall I'm not a fan of soggy buns I wasn't impressed enough by the burgers to ever really want to visit one of their locations again.  The onion chips were decently good though and went well with their BBQ sauce and made your burger taste a bit better if you added one to it.  The other thing I thought was funky was how they had chicken rings and onion chips either way I don't find my self craving anything from here like they advertise.  The line moves fairly quick though well at least for us it did as well as our food came out quickly too!  They sell beer here too so that's definitely awesome if your in it for a burger and beer!  Well what I will say is if you have never visited a White Castle and your next to one after you've had a few drinks pay them a visit because you might like it more than I did.",

When my sister-in-law saw that there was a White Castle in Las Vegas, one of her vacation stops here had to be White Castle--something that she fondly remembers from her youth.  I am still firmly in the I don't get it column.  There were three of us and we ordered a 10 pack bag with three bottles of water.  The sliders come out to be just over a dollar each but they were missing something.  Even the devoted sister-in-law thought they were missing at the very least some salt (and she doesn't use salt very much).    I was underwhelmed by the sliders.  The onion taste was about the best thing and it's really stretching it calling that little thin piece of beef a slider.  The thing is mostly bread.  Being in the Casino Royale doesn't make it an easily accessible place unless you're a tourist walking the Strip and decide to drop in.  We walked from the Venetian.  Again, I just don't get the cult following.  I'd rather spend a bit more and have something more substantial and a whole lot more flavorful!!",

    "text": "Charlton & the gang go to White Castle! Since this Vegas trip was primarily focused on burgers I wanted to experience as many places as possible. Ever since the movie Harold & Kumar go to White Castle popularized the existence of this burger chain to a wider audience, it has always been on the back of my mind to try it. Unfortunately since they are only located in the Midwestern United States, I had to settle on the frozen ones that they sell and love it or hate it, I find them quite tasty!   Las Vegas is known for housing popular \"guilty pleasure\" restaurants that can't be found outside of their respective regions or cities, making them must-visit destinations for tourists. Casinos have opened such iconic locations as Pink's Hot Dogs from Los Angeles in the Planet Hollywood Casino, and New York City's Shake Shack recently found a home inside the New York, New York Casino.  This White Castle is located across the street from the Mirage. You can easily walk to this location by parking either at the Ceaser's Palace self parking or at any other of the casinos close by and walk to it. The location is small but there is plenty of seating available inside. Since I've had the frozen ones plenty of times before, I wanted to order the exact ones which were the cheeseburger sliders. The lowest combo you can get is 4 sliders with fries and a drink which is what I decided to get (having still been fairly full from the buffet from earlier).   Once you place your order, you get a number to wait; thankfully orders are pushed out quick since they are made en masse. The sliders are all packaged individually; I can only imagine how many they go through a day. Taking my first bite, it instantly reminded me of the frozen ones. I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. The only difference was that there are pickles in the sliders that are not in the frozen ones. It does add more flavor to it but not much else. These sliders go quick, I can usually finish one in two bites or one if I really want to. The fries are crinkle cut, my personal favorite, they aren't as good as Del Taco's or Shake Shack's fries but it gets the job done.   I would suggest coming here if you have NEVER eaten the frozen ones before. Then you can brag to all your friends who live out in the west or east coast saying that you've actually been to an actually White Castle. This place is worth coming for a late night snack, drunk food or a quick meal. Otherwise, if you have had the frozen ones before then you are really not missing out on anything other than the pickle.   I am a fan of White Castle sliders but I'll settle for the frozen ones just fine.   CC out!",

They were in silverton casino for the food truck fair. I waited in line for over an hour. They were worth waiting for. Cost 1.00 each. Today I went to the strip to get some. Very disappointed.    The burgers were over cooked, no ketchup , no salt and the roll was like it was sitting unwrapped for hours. Dry and firm.Like a hamburger roll gets when left in sun.  In NY you are able to watch them make them. Seems like they are not making them the same way.  Corporate needs to bring out someone to train them and I don't  mean a manager. There was a lady in NY that was there for over 20 years. Food could be good but the chef has to cook it good.......",

I'm from Minnesota so to see a White Castle on the West Coast was like was Christmas in July. Finally found a parking spot this is really hard to there is no parking for them White Castle that is. Made it in and see no line, no surprise because White Castle always has a line. To my surprise a young man that was in line at the front front got upset because the people that were working we're laughing and doing nothing instead of working he being frustrated hit his cup off the counter counter. That's what got my attention he started screaming that there's a line of people and the people working are laughing joking not doing anything I noticed this was True they were all in a circle just kind of hanging burgers are sitting on the waiting table ready to be made or should I just say put together cuz they're already made and we're waiting. Fred the manager who was a woman I say that because I think they gave me the wrong name of the young lady but if Fred's the name Fred's the name Fred got mad at the young man for noticing that her workers weren't working and instead of apologizing threatened to give the money back, at first he was reluctant just wanted some ketchup but when that was a chore he said yes give me my money back. I just want to say that this made everyone get hands on deck when I say everyone's hands were moving they were all moving and I don't know if it was because Fred came out or if it was because the young man made a fuss but what I know is that I got my food a little bit quicker than I would have had he had not said anything... and he didn't even get to eat. Very sad to save my hometown restaurant Kansas City Missouri where my family is from, we grew up on White Castles. Bunch of onions piled up in the corner little mustard a pickle man that bread something else. I tell a lot of people about White Castles and everybody says this or says that me I love him Frozen from Minnesota or Frozen from in the grocery store what I don't like is bad customer service and that's exactly what I got at this White Castle with Fred as the manager. It was so bad that the drinks didn't even work and the young man who only was able to get his drink had to be mad about that as well.",

I'd say try out simply to say you had White Castle. For $10 you do get full and their onion chips are pretty good, but other than that know that they are mini sliders (and sliders are already small). I guess 4 mini sliders equals an average size burger. I would suggest though when in a group of four get the 10 sliders special and split should get you through and save money when looking to be resourceful with your expenses in Vegas.",

Price is a tad below average which is a small plus seeing its located on the strip. You might notice that the place is a dump in the inside, understandbly so many people. As for the burgers/sliders they were tiny and light and also tasteless nothing to write about but an after taste that stays in your mouth tasting like old onion. I went to use their toilets after waiting in line for 5 minutes, just as disgusting , it looks like the burgers rushed out of people's systems in a hurry.

    "text": "This probably deserves a 4-star rating given most people's expectations, so let me clarify before I get into the review: I have no real qualms about this place besides the price. The burgers are nearly as good as those in the Midwest.  So, the GOOD:  - Burgers are nearly as good as the Midwest - They give you as many ketchup packets as you want (you probably need to ask if you want any at all) - The place seemed clean enough during a busy night around 1 in the morning - The wait wasn't bad, for the ordering line or for the pickup line  The BAD:  - The main thing is the price. It shouldn't be more than a dollar per burger, and obviously buying more burgers should give you some sort of deal. But it's (as of April 2016) $35.99 for a crave case (30 plain sliders), which is almost the exact same price as 30 individual sliders. Likewise, it costs 30 cents to add cheese to a slider. If you add cheese to all 30 sliders, you might expect some deal. Nope. 30 cents times 30 slices of cheese is 9 dollars, which is the exact amount you'll have to add to your price if you want 30 sliders with cheese instead of regular sliders. That means you're paying $44.99 for 30 tiny sliders...and that's before taxes.  Look, I know it's the Vegas strip, so I don't really mind the price that much. Everything's more expensive, and the constant stream of customers proves they're asking a fair market price. Still, I'm taking away a star because that's just way too much money for those tiny burgers. It costs the same amount for 30 tiny sliders as for like 30 full size McDoubles.  - The burgers aren't quite as good as in the Midwest. They're still good -- they'll satisfy if you're a White Castle fan like myself -- but they're just slightly lacking. I think the problem is that they use this large island grill where something like 4 people work at once, and that open setup results in the steam escaping. For those who don't know, part of the magic of White Castle is that the burgers are cooked by steaming them over a bed of onions. So that onion flavor permeates the entire burger and bun. But with the Vegas location setup, I think the steam doesn't do it's job. Which also results in less moist buns.  But don't let this sway you from going here. Still very good.  - The staff wasn't all that friendly. Not that they were rude. When I asked for ketchup, the guy gave me plenty of ketchup, but didn't even look at me as he was serving me. The people on the grill looked a bit miserable. That's understandable, given they probably spend their day making millions of sliders non-stop because this is a hugely busy location. The girl taking orders was neither friendly nor unfriendly.  - The menu is a bit poorly done. The cheese options, for instance, are listed as a footnote at the top (are those still called footnotes?) where it mentions that you can add cheese or jalapeno cheese. For those unfamiliar with the White Castle menu, they'll probably just miss that option entirely.  - It's WAY at the end of the strip (that is, the part furthest from the 15 freeway). Not as far as Trump Hotel, but past the Venetian. So if you're down near Excalibur, or even the Cosmopolitan, you've got a long walk ahead of you. Might be better to drive to closer hotel and walk. Harrah's parking is free and easy to access off the strip (not sure about other hotels -- do your own research).  SUMMARY:  Go here. It's good.  So why the low rating? I'm taking off two stars because of 1) price and 2) not having the service or taste that lives up to the Midwest experience. But it's still quite good -- I just can't justify mathematically giving it 5 stars because 5 stars would be the standard White Castle experience, which this misses. But going here was still awesome.  PRO TIP: White Castles are excellent breakfast food. Let them sit overnight -- keep the burger cases overlapping to trap the moisture in! -- then let them sit out overnight and enjoy the next day.  Always consume with ketchup.  HELPFUL INFO for the uninitiated:  White Castle sliders are tiny and come standard with chopped, slightly grilled onion, and a pickle. No mustard or ketchup. You have to ask for ketchup packets if you want, but it's easier to bring your own bottle so you don't spend your meal opening and squeezing out 30 packets.  For guys with a young appetite, you could easily consume 10 sliders. Something like 6 might be enough for you.  Women and girls with lesser appetites might be satisfied with 2-4 sliders.  Don't forget to try out their other stuff, like jalapeno cheese, onion rings, etc. It's all good stuff.",

They are fresh, but they taste the same. We just came here to say that we have been to a White Castle. The food was just mediocre, even when we were starving, the food should taste way better, but it didn't. We took our share of pictures and that was it. Would we come here again? Probably not.

    "text": "I don't understand the rave about this place. Out of years of curiosity, I finally decided to try this place out. Why in Las Vegas? I don't know maybe because it is the only location I know of for now and no I would not try it from frozen bought from grocery stores. I'd rather have it freshly made to have a real experience of the slider.  Now, I've heard that the grilled onions are the specialty ingredient that gives the slider buns and patty a flavorful taste. Although True, the slider is very simplistic. Cheese and an extremely thin piece of Wendy's shaped patty, that is it. And guess how much it is, almost $2!! Seriously, this little tiny cube of a slider is more expensive than a burger from the dollar menu in Mc Donald's? Nuh uh... I can't comprehend the favoritism of this place.  Chicken rings were alright as what I would expect, a chicken nugget in the shape of a ring like an onion ring. What is weird is that the onion, on the other hand, doesn't come in rings as we are used to, but in chip form. The onion chips might be the only reason why I would come back to White Castle now. The pieces of onion are thick and wide and yep it does taste like onion and not just the fried batter.  Overall I think I'd appreciate this place more if their menu was less expensive for the amount they serve. This place is 24 hours so it caters to the drunk club goers. Actually now that I've thought of it, maybe the prices are high in order to keep dirty homeless people from coming in or hanging around. If I end up visiting the East Coast maybe I'd give White Castle another try someday but for now I'll stick with other burger places.",

    "text": "This was my first White Castle experience.  I had tried the frozen ones before and didn't care for them and was assured by many that I had to try the real thing.    I was excited that White Castle had opened in Vegas since it was more likely that I would make it to Vegas than the east coast.  Final the Vegas trip was booked and I was excited to try out White Castle.    Flash forward to Sunday morning.  The breakfast debate begins and me and my home skillet decide on White Castle.  Since its Vegas it's open 24/7 so why not!  White Castle is located on the strip in the Casino Royale.  The store front is located on the strip and easy to find.    As you walk in it feels like any fast food restaurant.  Ordering was quick, easy and friendly.  We ordered the 2 person combo with 10 sliders (5 with cheese, 5 original), a fry, an onion chip and two soda's for a little over $20.  Our order was up pretty quick.  They do require you show your receipt when you pick up your order.  I'm sure this is a safety measure as I can imagine as day turns to night and the party animals are on the loose there has been previous burger burglaries.    The moment has arrived the tiny little boxes of meat onions and bread is before me!  I take my first bite and.....it's alright.  I figure it's a east coast thing.  I'll stick to my my west coast In n' Out.  The restaurant itself was good, I can't blame them for my taste buds being born and raised on the west coast.   Moral of the story.....try it, you might like it, even if I didn't!",

    "text": "Good luck finding a White Castle stand-alone restaurant anywhere in California or the West Coast. This White Castle is the closest one I know where I live, but I wouldn't make the drive solely for WC. If I'm going to Vegas, I'm gambling, going to different buffets, and having my fun while I'm out here! I've came here on two separate visits to enjoy WC burgers. Cooked fresh in front of me instead of buying the WC burgers in my local supermarket freezer or convenience store.  I'd imagine this WC gets a ton of foot traffic and their employees getting paid well doing what they do. Do they deserve $15/hr? Hell no! Because of what I said, there will often be long lines which doesn't bother me much. The food is well worth the wait, and if you love their food wouldn't you mind waiting a little longer? They also don't serve burgers, nope. Veggie sliders, fish sliders, etc are also on their menu. I don't come here for anything but their burgers. I mean aren't they known for their burgers? I don't mind variety and options, but In N Out has done so well just serving burgers!",

Since they're sliders I suspected that they'd be small which was why I ordered two. The sliders come with grilled onions and pickles inside just an FYI if you don't like those stuff. You can see the chefs in the back cooking and boxing all the orders so I would say it's not exactly \"fresh\" because they're just constantly making the same thing over and over again. The chicken rings were good, they were like thinner chicken nuggets in a ring shaped form. Overall, this place was nothing special. Never been to the east coast to try the legit thing nor have I tried the frozen boxed one.   At least the workers were nice and efficient.",

From the outside it looked like a tiny standalone but actually the location is inside the Casino Royale.  Got the #7 Castle Pack, which was 10 sliders, two regular fries and two drinks.  Service was good as they got my order out quickly in spite of the place being packed but for my first time eating White Castle burgers at a White Castle I was rather disappointed.   These certainly did not hit the spot! I know sliders don't have much meat but these were practically meatless! And the onions could've tasted a whole lot better. The Fries were meh too as they were a bit soggy.  Not gonna lie, I enjoyed the microwave White Castle burgers you get from the grocery better...",

    "text": "Very small restaurant capitalizing off the brand's nostalgia and charm. They sell their signature miniature \"slider\" sized burgers at an overpriced rate. This seems to be the selling gimmick for White Castle, luring in drunk gamblers or curious tourists to stop in.   The restaurant itself is attached to the casino of the Venetian I believe. It is located on the Strip, with a one door entry point. A long line of hungry customers fills the restaurant, although it moves rather quickly. There are only 5-6 tables, with 2 larger bar-stool type tables for seating. As you reach closer to the register, you are welcomed with a better view to the behind-the-scenes look of White Castle. Rapid hands swiftly assemble buns amongst grilled onions and juicy meat patties, exchanging between different work stations to finally end up placed in a singular order, ready for the customer.   A large glass window display showcases some of the White Castle souvenirs that are available to purchase to take home. A $10 coffee cup or a $25 T-shirt? Not for me but maybe for others.   Last, but certainly not least, was the food. If you're familiar with the case and recognition of White Castle, then eating at the actual location only provides a slightly more fresh experience than the frozen, store-bought burgers. The buns are much softer and are squishy to the touch. The taste and aroma of the grilled onions complement the meat patty. It's White Castle, there isn't much too glorify about it or expect.   My experience was pleasant, but to each their own. For $8.99 you can get 4 Cheese Sliders, a small fry and a small drink. The price is consistent with the glamorization of the branding. I ate each slider in about 2 bites and was still hungry afterwards, but didn't want to face waiting in a long line again.   If you are nearby in the area, take a look!",

    "text": "First, if you come here for an earth shattering meal to a place known for feeding small burgers that is the basis of a stoner movie, you really need to get a CAT scan and a reality check.   However, if you come here to try a typically East Coast only chain that serves small greasy little burgers that spawned a Stoner movie, then you won't be disappointed. This place is inside a casino but has about 10 tables, is stylized like the East coast locations, and has an assembly crew to handle the giant lines.  Expect about a 20-30 minute wait when you go to order.  I love these little burgers, they are the size of a post-it note and about 2 inches tall. Each one is served in a small cardboard box. I like the original without cheese (its just a greasy bun, onions, and patty), the wife likes the ones with cheese.  We pick up 15-20 when we are in the mood for them and these hit the spot from this location.  These will not stack up against \"premium burger\" joints, they are not a premium burger.  This is your 2 am burger where you got a hangover and you need grease.  This is what you get, greasy, greasy goodness. If you want great beef flavor, go to one of the million other burger joints on the strip.  If you order any of the sides beware, they are all mediocre. Imagine going to a Burger King and ordering fried chicken... Are you really surprised that it sucks? If you go to White Castle, just get the burgers, skip the rest. If you get the rest, that is on you...  The price is a little more than the locations on the East Coast but when everyone else is price gauging on the strip, you can't blame White Castle for doing the same... Worth a try if you have never had it, but do yourself a favor, drink a yard long margarita with a few extra shots first.  That will put you in the right state of mind for White Castle.",

I loved each mini cheeseburger with a sliced pickle and chopped onions on it.  I didn't give it 5 stars, as the fries definitely needed some fresh oil and some TLC.  They were a bit brown and sad for fries, so I'd recommend going with the onion chips (like pieces of crispy onion rings).  If you haven't gone, you just need to!",

    "text": "So you're drunk on the Strip and you want that delicious but poor food choice? Yep White Castle fits the bill. The sliders are little bites of heaven which do a great job coating your alcohol laden belly. Being originally from Detroit there was a White Castle on every corner so it wasn't an urgent run to try them when they arrived on the Strip. Being drunk and at Harrah's seeing the White Castle was like a beacon calling us over. The place was packed as we weren't the only ones with the same brilliant idea. The cashiers do a pretty efficient job filling all the orders as quick as possible so expect to wait 15 minutes on a busy weekend night. 4 cheeseburgers, fries, and a pop (dammit I'm from Michigan and it's POP not soda) will set you back $8.99 but the extra space it soaks up for more alcohol consumption is priceless. Thank you White Castle!",

    "text": "My love for white castle will never go away, since I had my first on Hollywood Blvd in 1984 right before I was going to watch Ghostbusters at the Egyptian theatre.  After that was gone, I was subjected to Frozen White Castle burgers from the grocery store.  I believe the now gone famous Mermaid casino served white castle burgers, but they were not made there, but I was still happy.  I was even thinking about flying out of state to Kentucky just to experience the restaurant again 33 years later.  After a taxi ride down the boulevard, I spotted the White House logo in the Best Western Plaza.  Instead of going to Caesars palace, I had the taxi turn around and take me to white castle.  There are so many great restaurants in Las Vegas, and I love gourmet food.....but something about this place reminds me of my childhood.  I ordered 6 cheeseburgers and fries. Pigged out like there was no tomorrow.  Did not care if I would have a stomachache later that night.  The burger is a mini bun, with an oh so thin patty, and slicer of cheese. I like mine with a pack of ketchup.its like a fast food appetizer, except I got greedy.  All I know is thank you for having a White Castle in Vegas, when I thought there was no more around.  I was too hungry to even take a pic of my food, just had the empty box.",

Negatives were the smaller menu (would love some jalapeno burgers), location is not the best, gets a bit crowded/long lines, over priced for sure, and the fries, meh, still not very good. Still, living in Phoenix now, I am thrilled I can get great sliders without having to fly back to Chi-town - I would definitely hit this place every time I was in town.",

I should have followed my gut and not eaten here. I saw about 6 employees, just one cashier and two standing around not doing anything. The grills and floor looked a mess and needless to say it did not look appealing. We paid and the food was ready two secs later. What does that that mean? That we were served burgers that most likely had been prepared who knows how long ago. Sliders were super soggy.  The fries were not hot, tasted rubbery and old.  About 15 minutes after eating, I started feeling nauseous with a stomach pains. I pride myself on being able to eat anything without consequence.. but never again.",

    "text": "So I've had the frozen White Castle burgers from my local grocery store & always liked those. So when I first came across White Castle out here in Vegas it was @ a Foodie Truck festival & OMG they were soooo gross, they made me want to get sick so I threw them away.   Last year I was on the strip with some of my friends & they stopped by this location for some food but I skipped the lines & opt out due to not liking them that time @ the Foodie Fest.   But the other night (late thurs am) my friend & I were out on the strip & he's a vegetarian & heard they sold vegetarian burgers & wanted to go & check it out. So this time I actually decided to give them another try. We were so hungry & ordered a bunch of stuff, as their burgers are very tiny. We got 2 burgers, 1 chicken sandwich, 1 fish & 1 veggie sandwich. An order of cheese sticks, french fries & onion chips.   So we start to go to town on our food & I realize I have no marinara dipping sauce for the cheese sticks so I have to go up to the counter & request some & also got some Honey mustard sauce. Everything I ate was good. After my friend ate his veggie burger he couldn't find his fish sandwich. We double checked everything, accounted for the empty containers & realized we never got it. So he went up to the counter to let staff know this. Next thing I know he comes back to the table with the manager all angry & upset. I told the lady \"my friend didn't get his fish sandwich.\" They were arguing with each other because the manager didn't believe him, she thought he was lying so that's why my friend became so angry with her. Really lady?? My friend is going to make up a lie about something he didn't get when he could afford 100+ of them........I've never been to a business where one was questioned about a missing item from their order. The manager eventually told him she would get him another one & walked off. He filled me in on what happened & I felt like she probably would spit in his sandwich after all that arguing so he didn't want his sandwich now so we got up & left.   It was late @ night & not very busy @ all. There were probably 7 people in the eating area. The one thing that was an eye sore was a guy passed out with his head on the table drooling all over it. Money was hanging out of his pocket & he had an open bottle of baby lotion with lotion all over the table with his trash on the table. The manager had to have seen this guy as he was sitting behind me & never went over to wake the guy up & tell him to either stay awake or leave. His food was gone so it looked like he was just looking for a place to take a nap. I even woke him up to tell him his money was falling out of his pocket & he woke up briefly then went back to sleep. I can't believe the manager would allow someone to just be passed out like that. There even was a guy who was sweeping the floor who had to have seen this guy too as he swept by him & didn't try to wake him up.   Besides being disgusted with how the manager treated & spoke to my friend over one tiny fish sandwich that he paid for and didn't get then stood there & argued with him about it in front of everyone in the dinning room, the fact that she lets people pass out/sleep & drool on their table is a major reason why I won't go back here & advise my friends to skip a trip here too.   The next day something even more major happened.......I got sick from their food. Let's just say the food turned into liquid & found a quick way out of my body. Becareful eating here guys, stay close to a toilet afterwards!!!",

I had to try this place though to say that I've been, but as for going back, I'm not sure about that....   The sliders are extremely tiny. If you do choose to get them, the CHEESE SLIDERS are way better than the ORIGINAL SLIDER which pretty much consist of bun, patty and pickle. Most definitely can make something way better at home. I think I need some more content in the sliders. They're dry and bland. Sadly do not taste good. Definitely for those with the munchies and just want a quick bite to eat. You'll definitely also need way more than a few sliders to get filled up. The CHICKEN RINGS, they are just ok. Not as great as everyone says it is, just reminds me of the dinonuggets we can heat up at home, but in a shape of a ring. The LOADED CHEESE FRIES were probably my favorite part of the whole meal. Simple, but the most tasty with the bacon, cheese, some mayo ranch smothered on top of crinkle fries.  Ultimately, good to know that I've tried it, but not a place to return to. Good thing is, I didn't have to pay for parking because there's a tiny lot in the back.",

Whatever the reason, White Castle has been on my bucket list of burger joints.  I thought what a perfect time to check White Castle off my list when I saw it on the Las Vegas Strip.  Las Vegas is actually White Castle's presence in the West.   Strolling the Strip after lunch, we decided to check out the offerings at White Castle. Known for introducing The Slider, we got two Original sliders to try. The sliders are steam-grilled and consists of a thin 2\"x2\" all beef patty with onions and a slice of pickle.  The square shaped beef patty looked like a processed patty. The original does not include ketchup, mustard and or mayonnaise. So I put some ketchup on my slider. The beef was bland tasting.   While ordering, I noticed that the sliders are mass produced and are lined a sheet pan.  They are not made to order.   Compared to other burger chains, it doesn't match up to In-N-Out or Habit.  Maybe good enough to stop by for a quick snack?  But I'm glad I got my White Castle curiosity out of the way and know that I won't be having craving for The Original Slider.",

You can see it a bit red not sure if it is undercooked or what. The cheese gives it some taste but the original sliders (without cheese) is just awful.   I have to say the chicken and fish are not bad. But all in all I don't recommend this place at all (or the chain for that matter).",

I'm talking about a place where the soda flows and the decadent burgers sizzle in a cozy bed of onions. WHITE CASTLE.   What are you about to experience? A miracle on Earth! A culinary climax.

The employees...I mean heroes that work in the heat work hard to bring joy to all.

    "text": "My family and I are on a short vacation in Vegas on the weekend before July 4th when my dad, who is familiar with the movie involving White Castle, suggests trying this \"iconic\" hamburger chain for lunch.   LOCATION: This store was along the Vegas Strip and was actually in a casino. The tables and chairs were clean, but there is smoke in the air from the casinos nearby, and if you are like me and you don't like the smell, then it would be better to eat somewhere else.   SERVICE: The ladies at the register were really abrupt and a bit impatient when it came to ordering. Although I do understand that they are doing their job, I still had hoped for better service, especially when we arrived around 11 a.m. and they only had a guest behind us.   CONS: -Price: It was pretty expensive for very small portions, but then again, it IS Vegas. I ordered the original sliders (4 sliders) with onion fries and loaded fries combo. and it already costed $8.  -Portion: The sliders were VERY small and unsatisfactory. There was a special pack that included about 10 sliders for about $18 which STILL wouldn't have been fulfilling.  -Loaded Fries: It was okay, but visually, not appealing because it looked like they just dumped the cheese and the bacon onto fries.  -Self-Serve: We had to add on our own mayo and ketchup onto the hamburgers. For some people, they might prefer it this way because they can adjust how much they'd want in each slider, but for me, I had to use multiple packets of the condiments, which wastes a lot of plastic.   PROS: The hamburger sliders themselves were not too bad and the location was conveniently close to the Flamingo and Bally's Hotels. I also got a souveneir cup for upgrading to loaded fries which was pretty cool.   Overall, this place, for me, functions as a place for a quick snack and if you're willing to pay the price for more sliders to fulfill yourself, then go ahead. However, the price to do so, in my opinion, would be better used for a buffet or some sort... where the food is more appealing, more satisfactory, and more fulfilling. I would not come here again unless I am really desperate for something to eat.",

Took a trip to Vegas to pick up the Mister from a business trip and he asked where should we eat... Duh....White Castle. This was our one and only chance to get our hands on these mini burgers.   There is no easy way here. You have to park at The Venetian then walk outside. No biggie. You can see on the strip, it's near Sephora and attached to Casino Royale.  Not going to lie. These pint size burgers taste a step above the ones you buy from your local grocery store. But the onions are fresher and you get a pickle. It's all about the hype. If you like frozen White Castle then you will like this place. If you hate those frozen White Castle burgers then steer clear. In case you dont know. These burgers are steamed. They then pile steamed onions on top then slide them into little boxes. They are paper thin. So go with the doubles.  Between the 2 of us we ate 4 double castle cheeseburgers. 2 regular cheeseburgers. 1 chicken burger and ALL the sides. The fries are horrible. I mean super gross. Save your money and get the onion chips. The mozerella sticks were average. Ask for marinara sauce because they won't give them to you.   Either you love White Castle or hate White Castle. Or maybe your just curious. I was just curious. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. But if I were passing by, and lived 1000 miles away from the nearest White Castle then I would go.  P.S. the soda is extra fizzy and bubbley.",

The sliders were pretty basic tasting cheese burger but I suppose does the job, especially if you're drunk.   You can buy these frozen sliders from your local supermarket too which decreases the value by alot. Next time, if you really want these sliders, check our local supermarket and buy it to microwave at home. Nothing too fancy here!",

It wasn't too bad as I liked how the bread was fresh and everything was freshly made. I also liked how there was fresh onions on it too. It was pretty cool how you could see the kitchen from the register at this particular location so everything is made fresh and you can watch it being made.   No complaints about service either. Even if its just a fast food chain, the staff was friendly and working as fast as they could since there was a huge line of people waiting for their food.

It's pretty sad when the customer is the one who smiles and asks the employee how they're doing instead of the other way around. Not one smile or anything...just \"what can I get you\". I will not ever come back to this White Castle again when I am in Vegas because it's a crap show.

The service was pretty quick but afterall it is a fast food joint.  I can't really compare it to other White Castle but in comparison to In N Out and other burgers spots its right up there in my opinion.  If I'm ever in Vegas again I wouldn't be oppose to picking up a few for the road.  They are really affordable and thats probably the best thing about them.  The sliders are really flavorful.  We drove to get here so it kinda sucks but if you're walking the strip I don't think it should be that bad.  Overall I'd definitely return again.  The sliders are legit and taste way better than I expected them to.",

People just don't clean up after themselves.  :(  Oh well...   The burgers are served on a dinner roll.  I'm glad they serve it plain without any sauces but it does come onions and pickles.  The fries were a bit cold despite of being busy and the fries being served quickly.    Overall, the burgers were alright.  I ate half of it and threw the rest away.  I probably should've been drunk that it would've tasted much better to me.   A lot of people like their burgers but for me I don't think I'll return.",

If you're walking the strip, you've been drinking and hungry then White Castle is a must! It's a newer spot on my way back to my hotel so I figured, why not? What you eat in Vegas, stays in Vegas.   Since it's only sliders, I ordered a variety so that I can get my White Castle fix. My favorite was the Jalapeno Cheese Sliders. It wasn't spicy at all just in case you don't like spicy foods. The patty on the sliders are very thin and I recommend getting the doubles. White Castle has a nice twist of an onion ring with their Onion Chips. It wasn't bad and complimented the sliders well.   The staff here is what you expect from a fast food restaurant but the customers are interesting. It ranges from the very drunk, drunk, families to completely sober people. Luckily they have ample tables and seating in their dining area. It could be cleaner but you have to option to take out. For me, I'm glad this experience stayed in Vegas.",

So here's my verdict:   Cheeseburger- 2.5 stars  Jalapeno cheeseburger- 3.75 stars. The white cheese is a nice change of pace from American cheese, adds a slight kick and adds an extra oomph to the overall burger compared to the regular cheese.  Fish burger- 3 stars  Crinkle cut fries- 3 stars. Just average.  Onion chips- 3.5 stars. Good breading, nicely fried. Have had better but not too shabby for fast food.   7 burgers, one drink, and onion chips came out to about $19.   I'll be back for the onion rings and the jalapeno cheeseburger.",

I have had WC and Krystle before, so I knew what was in store for me. Mini burgers served in packs with fries and soda. It's a pretty simple meal.   The lady behind the counter (wish I had gotten her name) was extremely courteous and appreciative of her job. She was telling us how another location just opened up in DTLV and how she was assisting there too. Though tired, she told us how she's thankful for the work and happy to serve the customers providing her and her coworkers jobs. I always have an appreciation for people who appreciate the opportunities given to them. We ordered the special at the time which was Jalepeno sliders with spicy jack cheese and regular cheese burgers. It's more a place to give it a shot, but don't expect a mind blowing, fine dining burger experience. We also upgraded our fries to loaded fries which was worth it. It is connected to the casino, which was surprisingly not bad considering you'll normally be exposed to the stench of cigar/cigarette smoke which was not an issue when I dined here. The dining area, along with the soda fountains were  kept up well as there was plenty of foot traffic in and out of this particular WC.",

We only came here since we were starving and needed something fast. The fries were the only good thing, which was crispy and pretty good. I'm not used to having a burger that has a soft consistency that tasted mushy. It was just ok. I won't be coming back anytime soon. The cashier does ask if you're a local or visiting (if you're a local, you get a small discount).",

I've been to multiple locations on the east coast, and wish they would come to Cali, but Vegas is close enough for now.  Having the cheeseburgers made fresh are 20x better than the frozen ones. Hands down, my favorite tasting fast food cheeseburger. I love the Hawaiian style sweet bread for a bun, the grilled chopped onions, the juicy flavor of the meat and the melted cheese. The chicken was juicy and tender and the breading was a little crunchy. Mmmmmm so good for a quick bite to eat. Many people come here to try the burgers and complain that they are small. Duhhh, they are called cravings because they are small slider type mini burgers. Either way, I love their burgers, and am glad to see a closer location.   This location has beer, soda, donuts, fries, burgers with and w/out cheese, and chicken sandwiches. The line was long when I arrived, but moved really quick. The food was ready within 4 minutes and there was plenty of seats inside. We enjoyed our food before we continued walking, and took the 4 cheeseburgers we had left for later.   Whenever I am in Vegas, you can guarantee I will stop by.",

I was not impressed but super hungry. I got a number 2 which consisted of 4 small White Castle cheeseburgers with crinkle cut fries and a drink. I enjoyed the crinkle cut fries. I had a raspberry iced tea. The burgers were filled with cheese and pickles. I don't like pickles in our burgers. I think this place gets too much hype. Place had refill Coke soda station like the old school fountains. Descent place to eat.   The guy at the register was super nice. The guy calls your number when your food is ready. You basically dump your own trash. There is plenty of seating. At least I got to try this place once.",

We ordered sliders with the American cheese and jalapeno cheese, fries, chicken rings, onion chips, and a drink. We also got the brownie and cheesecake dipped in fudge for dessert. We wanted to try everything on the menu basically lol the food came out pretty fast. It really fell flat on the food. Everything was really bland. There's no seasoning whatsoever on anything. The sliders were kinda soggy. The onion chips had such a thick coating with no flavor. The best thing we had was probably the brownie for dessert lol it's cool to try if you're curious since it's quite famous. Just don't expect a lot so you won't get disappointed.",

The frozen cheesecake on a stick is worth the trip alone.     I admit that when I first tried this place it took a while to grow on me, but now I really crave these simple little burgers.  I try to stop in every couple of weeks for a quick bite.  I avoid the weekend tourist crowds and always stop there for weekday lunch.  My parking experience has improved since I discovered the back entrance.  The only bad thing about this place is getting in and out of the parking lot, but that's not the restaurant's fault so I won't ding them for that.  I also get a kick out of the people walking out with two suitcases full of these things.  Like they're buying enough to feed a whole plane.",

I was already convinced the only time I would actually get a chance to have it again was during my visits home to Jersey.   I do not go here or to any White Castle burger shop for anything other than the cheese burgers. I wouldn't mention this place if someone was looking for a good \"fries\" spot, this isn't the place for you.   I do highly recommend the cheese sliders and onion rings. The taste is definitely unique and savory. The patties are small (slider), but also thin and slowly cooked on a bed of finely diced onions. The bun is soft and not doughy, which creates a perfect meat to bread ratio.   The price is fairly inexpensive and it is such a clutch late night meal after a long day, or night of partying. Also great place to try if you are on a mission to try unique tasting burgers. Also, if you are a fan of milkshakes that are on the thicker side of the scale, this is the perfect place. Have fun experiencing the ultimate milkshake/ burger enlightenment.   I will admit the 4 star rating maybe more about growing up with this burger than the actual restaurant.  Go explore! Get adventurous!",

    "text": "For starters...for all the people giving it low stars because of the wait they had to endure yesterday (this review is being written the day after the Grand Opening), you're all morons.  Seriously.  What in the world did you expect?    As far as taste goes, White Castle is not for some.  I can't hate on people not liking it if it's their first time.  I'm also well aware there are FAR more better burgers available, but sometimes you just want a White Castle that is cooked unlike any other burger.    The burger tasted like I expected, and the cashier, who I'm sure wanted to rip her own head off, was a sweetheart.  Being the lines were so crazy, I asked her if anybody in her team had walked out yet, and she said \"we're soldiers!\".  I loved her attitude, and I wish I had remembered her name.  My gripe, and why it's 3 stars, is with their pricing.  I know it's a strip joint, but there are other chains that charge their regular prices on the strip.  A few steps down is a Chipotle and a McDonald's that charges the same as any other one of their locations.  I don't care that rents are higher on the strip and it's their only location.  Whenever they come into town...locals CRAM THEIR FOOD TRUCKS for their burgers.  They could have just as easily chosen an off-strip location and made a killing off of us.  I split a Crave Pack that came with 10 hamburgers (we paid extra for cheese), 20 chicken rings, and 2 regular fries.  Large sodas ($2.99) were separate.  The bill came out to $38.88.  I'm sorry, but $19.50 for 5 cheeseburgers, 10 chicken rings, fries, and a soda is lame.  For $20, I can come up with 50 other places I rather eat at.    Also, they offer a combo that comes with 3 cheeseburgers and regular fries for 8.77...WITHOUT A SODA.  That's just wrong considering fountain soda usually has the highest markup of any of their items.  They could've easily included the soda.    I won't be going back, but I'm hoping that they'll open up some off-strip locations and possibly offer the pricing that other White Castles are used to offering...because at the end of the day...this is White Castle, not Five Guys (or any other burger joint of your choice).",

Had the regular beef sliders, chicken sliders, and cheese fries. The beef I found was pretty thin, but the toppings and the fluffy bun def made it taste above average. The chicken lacked toppings and was a tad dry. The cheese fries are good, but you could probably make your own easily at home. Overall, it was a mediocre experience for me. At the end of the day, it's fast food. So if you just want something relatively quick and cheap, this could be one of your options.",

    "text": "After hearing about White Castle for ages, I finally found myself near one in Vegas so my wife and I decided to give it a try. My fist impression is that it is a bit strange, they have a very precise process of cooking onions, burgers and buns, and it all appears very methodical. They cook on these little square griddle inserts in the counters and there are multiple little stations.  Not sure where their beef comes from, but it does look a bit unappetizing when they are laying it out in the onions, at first I thought they were putting on some sort of red square rubber spacers with holes in them so they can steam the buns with the onion aroma, but nope, those square red Lego looking things are actually the patties.  I was aware that they only offer little sliders, but I was not aware that the little sliders cost the same as a full sized burger elsewhere (1 single plain slider with nothing on it costs $1.35), they have to have huge margins here as you get basically a meatball on a roll for the price of a Big Mac. (Not that I condone eating Big Macs) We ordered the meal that came with 4 sliders (with cheese) and some fries, and also ordered 2 of their chicken ring sliders. The chicken ones were actually pretty tasty, tasted very similar to burger kings chicken sandwiches, the sort of over processed ground chicken variety. The sliders were fairly tasty and I did like the idea of eating the little thing, and though they are very basic they taste pretty good, as everything cooks in and with their caramelized onions. I did, however, need to dip the burger in ketchup to get a more deep flavor. I felt like they tasted sort of like a basic McDonald's Cheeseburger and an In-n-out \"Animal Style\" cheeseburger had a baby (so somewhere I between the quality of the 2 though much more on the McDonald's side). The Fries were also pretty good, though nothing to write home about. They are the wavy variety and not over salted.  Because the things were so small, I had the go back and order more food! This time I got 2 more chicken ring sliders and went for 2 double cheese sliders this time, which by the way are over $3 a piece! That's like the price of the \"six dollar burger\" at Carl's Jr, or the more expensive burgers at about every fast food chain, but again even the double burger is less substantial than a single \"$.99 cent menu\" burger elsewhere.  All in all we ended up spending over $30!!! Just to get full here, that is a ton for a fast food place! I really don't think I'll be back to a White Castle anytime soon, it's possible the craving could hit me when I see one because it is a unique taste, but even then, I'll likely just grab one slider to go and eat it on the way to wherever else I'm going to eat.",

    "text": "I used to hear my friend talk about eating at White Castle. He was so hype about it. So once I saw this, I had to go try it. Service was great. Food was prepared quick. I ordered the double slider, cheese slider, and a fish slider. Size is your typical small slider size; smaller than a McDonalds. The food was just plain. Your bun, cheese, meat, pickles, onions? and that's it. If there was sauce, I couldn't taste it. Good thing they offered condiments like ketchup, mayo, mustard, ranch, honey mustard, BBQ sauce, zesty sauce, hot sauce, etc. Mayo went well with the fish slider I got. Honey mustard went well with the double slider. All in all, I was a little disappointed in the taste. I don't want to have to add my own sauce... Well, at least I tried it...",

I mean 32 $ for 20 burgers with cheese and pickles not too bad for it being on the strip. They serve beer and wine too... my only problem was that they charged  6$ for cheese ..",

Living in California, we don't have a White  Castle, except for the frozen aisle. I was in town for the weekend, and before I left I got some White Castle. I was honestly hesitant about coming in, thinking this would be exactly like the frozen aisle. Dear reader , rest assured, you will be glad you came in! White Castle was my favorite part of my stay, seriously.   I can't describe the feeling, but you will be screaming with excitement!",

    "text": "When I heard about White Castle coming to Vegas, I honestly got excited about it. I've never been to one of their locations before but I figured it would be a cool experience, especially seeing it practically get famous from Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (I can't believe that movie is 11 years old now!)  Located on the Casino Royale side of the Strip, White Castle offers cheap sliders at any time of the day. I honestly think it's better than most fast food chains, but it tasted the same as the microwaveable ones you can buy at the grocery store.  The breakfast slider was pretty good, though. It really isn't anything special because it's just a sausage patty with an egg, but it does the trick if you want something simple and filling for breakfast.  It's not a gourmet burger joint, but it's definitely nice to have one of these on the Strip. The cheap prices and better quality food than other fast food chains are what makes White Castle a winner in my book! It might be a little too over-hyped, but it's still a place to visit just to say you've been to one.",

    "text": "I'd say this is a good experience for those who've heard the legend of White Castle (much like how East Coasters need to try In N Out, us West Coasters need to try White Castle) and only have tasted the retail supermarket frozen freezer version of these mini silders.  I was actually fairly excited at the prospect of trying the White Castle Burger.  They sell them individually and they're over $1 each.  If you look at the special \"dollar menu\" items at rival fast food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, Wendy's etc. and take a step back and analyze how much food you get in a White Castle Burger vs a full sized burger, it doesn't add up 'tho.  It takes at least 4 White Castle Burgers to equal a standard burger (not even a Whopper or a Big Mac, Quarter Pounder, Jumbo Jack or Happy Star).  So, to that degree, I think the mini-burgers are worth at most $0.50 each and ideally, not to be thrifty sounding, but in analyzing pound for pound and bang for the buck comparisons to their peers, maybe 3 for $1 or 4 for $1, so about $0.25 each (they did debut after all for $0.05, a nickle each, albeit back in the 1920's nearly a century ago.  Beyond the pricing, the food was unique, it has a soft steamed bun with a pickle and chopped cooked onions with a very thin and sort of slimy (not in a bad way) square (a la Wendy's) beef patty which is reminiscent of those Banquet/Swanson's frozen dinner \"Salisbury steak\" or sliced meatloaf.  It's quite tasty and I like 'em where others may feel they're stoner late night snacks, I can see eating 'em and easily going through 4 and possibly eating 10 and maybe even being up to the challenge of over indulging to potentially eat 20... and those statements are both a testament to the fact they do taste good, but they're also not so filling and very small in size.  The french fries are really weak 'tho, previously frozen crinkle cut, very thin, small portions.  I'd roll the money to be spent on fries towards other food purchases.  Del Taco uses similar styled fries, but they're much better in pricing, portions and execution (fried nice and fluffy inside and crispy outside).  I rate this * * * three stars, \"A OKAY\" which means I'd recommend it and come back again, but it's not necessarily so unique that I'd crave it and put it on my \"must go to\" list whenever in the area, which is in part my criteria for my rankings of places that earn four or five stars.  This location is on the Vegas Strip in a very safe area, easy to park if you park in a hotel casino I'm sure, congested to get to by car via the Las Vegas main strip, but convenient if you're staying in a local hotel.",

The buns were soggy, the meat was extremely flimsy and tasted so artificial, and the fries were unevenly cooked and unseasoned.  The fries tasted as if they were from the freezer section.

I ordered the two cheeseburgers with chicken rings and the total was about $10. It is very expensive for very little food. The thing that really bothered me was one of the rude worker. After waiting for about 15 minutes to get my food, I asked the lady what type of condiments that they served here because it was my first time here. Her response was, 'well condiment do you want.' So I replied with what are your options. She was just rude about it and for some reason wouldn't tell me. I got frustrated so I just told her to tell me the ones they have so I can choose and if you can't do that then I want one of every condiment there is to offer. She finally told me and I got what I wanted, but all this altercation was very unnecessary.   This place is pricy, has little food for what you pay for, busy, and has rude workers. No reason to ever come back here again or ever recommend people to come here. It was overly hyped due to the movie and that is the only reason this place is busy.",

    "text": "Well, well, well-- another burger joint in Vegas. And guess what? It's affordable, especially after an intense session at the slots or tables! Or if you had ''too much fun'' at the clubs.  Location: This burger hot spot is located near the Linq, across from Mirage-- it's literally next to \"Margaritaville'' or whatever. But definitely easy to spot (look for the castle structure sign).  Interior: This is a typical fast food joint. Need I say more?  Food: The burgers were pretty small. Being a Hefty Hannah that I am (inside and out), 5 burgers & fries would probably fill me up. I kid you not, I could probably fit 2-3 burgers in the palm of my hand. Compared to Shake Shack & In n Out -- this place is.... different. If you're into small & soft burgers-- this is the place for you. Also, I really like how the cheese is always melted in the burger (that's total perfection). However, the squiggly fries were \"eh.\" Same with the chicken rings-- I could pass on both and stick with the CHEESEBURGERS. Oh, and be sure to ask for the sauces with your burgers-- it definitely makes for an exciting twist. Between the other burger spots, I would choose this place because it's one of those, hashtag cheap eats -- and bragging rights of \"OMG, I ate 10 burgers!\"  Service:  It was alright. Nothing to complain about.  TLDR: This place is great for cheap burgers-- comparable to McDonalds, but better. in flavor and MELTED CHEESE! Burgers are small, so order A LOT (5-6 per person).  Turn Ons: - Cheap - Melted cheese - Super small KAWAIIIII burgers - Sauces - Opens 24/7 (I think...).  Turn Offs: - Fries & Chicken rings (ew)",

At least I can say that I've been to White Castle(although not with Harold and Kumar). :)",

    "text": "Haha!! Finally got to try this place after years and years of wanting to try their infamous burgers after the Kumar and Harold movie. This was probably the first spot we hit up after we arrived in Las Vegas because that's how badly and excited we were to come here. Here are my thoughts...they taste just like the frozen ones!!! They taste exactly the same except it has a pickle haha. They are kinda expensive too for a dinky burger. I am glad I got to finally try it. If I crave for it I can always get the frozen ones. The milkshake was good. The bigger combo you get the cheaper the burgers are per unit. They are quite expensive for what it is individually. It is probably expensive because of the brand and because it's located on the strip. Everything on the strip is super expensive and overpriced. I think a cheeseburger is like $1.69 each? Overall, this is one of those places you gotta check out when you're in Las Vegas because it's the only one in the east coast. It's opened 24/7 so that's awesome. Hungry? Why wait? Grab a White Castle burger. Just don't spoil your appetite. I ate so much burger while in Vegas that I didn't enjoy my Gordon Ramsey burger at BurGR and didn't enjoy my Shake Shack burger too lmao. I would definitely come here again to show off since it's the only one in the east coast.",

    "text": "A short walk north of The Linq is the brand new White Castle location. It opened on January 27, 2015 next to Casino Royale has been busy ever since. The only time I could get a White Castle was when I was in Chicago for a tradeshow. I simply had to hit the Vegas location up for these tasty little sliders.  Loaded Fries are topped with cheese sauce, ranch, and bacon. I love the crinkle cut fries which holds the sauce and toppings really well. Nothing better than cheesy fries, unless they are topped with chili too. Rating: 5/5  Double Original Slider is two beef patties with an extra piece of bread in the middle and topped with onions and pickle. Patties are steam grilled with the onions which adds more flavor to the patty. The buns are put on top to steam as well. The whole slider is just juicy and soft. There are imitators but this is the original! Rating: 3/5  Double Cheese Slider is two beef patties with an extra piece of bread in the middle and topped with cheese, onions, and pickle. When I bit into the first one, I was in foodie heaven. There is nothing like the juicy beef flavor with the grilled onions and gooey cheese. I was being good, but I could have easily eaten a couple more of these. Rating: 5/5",

She asked if we wanted onion chips or fries with our order and we wernt sure what onion chips were so she gave us a sample.  How sweet was that?  We went with it.  The burgers are steamed format with onions and yes it tastes much better fresh than frozen.  I must say though that being a Cali girl that it just can't compare to In N Out and The Habit. I really wanted to love WC but it was only so-so.  Shake Shack is next on my list.",

The five of us dropped in for a snack following a show at the Venetian.    Queued up and looked at overhanging menu posted above.  Combo pack = 10 burgers, two fountain drinks, and two orders of fries could satisfy our palates.  The order taker asked if we wanted cheese.  O.k.   Total came to about $24.00.  Almost $5.00 per person for a what we got didn't seem worth it to me.  I'll pass next time.  But those are the kind of prices even for junk food in Vegas.  Mystery burger meat shaped thin and square.  The chopped onions and the pickle made up for it.  Soft burger bun.  Maybe two to four bites depending on your bite.  Served in individual cardboard boxes.  I say save money and use paper.  Need to be more eco friendly.  The kitchen was working hard.  Look over the counter and you'll see the assembly line.  And another mentally challenged person who popped himself at our table.  Talking and mumbling to himself.  First in Phoenix and now in Vegas.",

I scarfed those bad boys down and thought they weren't half bad. Couple days later I got the 2 dbl chs w fries and soda for $7.99 but thought the middle bun was too squishy and unnecessary. Not much of a line, pretty quick service, what could be better?",

It is Las Veags, and it is a bit pricey,  but for any True sliders fan;  they know these are the best little burgers. The flavor is amazing and the softness of the bread is excellent. I love how they cook the sliders over a bed of steamed onions. Nothing has changed here since I first had one as a little kid. If you did not grow up on these sliders than you missed out. I love White Castle. Finally the west coast is catching up.",

If you have never had them before, like my California friends you might not like them.  A guy who works at a hotel here said they aren't as good as Jersey, then said that in n out is not good either and he prefers Sonic.  I think his taste buds have died, and there is NO way he is from Jersey.",

This one wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't wasn't the same as the ones back home.  They were tasty, and not bad at all, but they just tasted like the boxed ones that you can pick up at Vons, only with someone else heating them up for you.  I'd come back while drunk or on a craving, but for an authentic White Castle burger it looks like I'll be catching a flight from LAX back to O'Hare.",

    "text": "The hype with this one was strong.  What with the constant talk on local news stations, blogs, websites how could you not feel the pressure as a lover of food in Las Vegas? We were not immune to the build-up and thus had to see what we were missing all these years.  We visited on a Saturday, early evening/late afternoon timeframe. The place was busy, but that was no surprise with the aforementioned popularity still booming. The line was relatively long but moved at a decent rate. They do well to get you through and on your way. We waited about 15-20 minutes in line. The menu is simpler than most fast food type joints with limited offerings. Think somewhere between In n Out and Chil Fil A. I appreciate this; makes it easier for someone like me who wants to get right to the \"bread and butter\" if you will and skip over their second rate items. The sliders were much smaller than we expected; again we've never had even the frozen grocer variety so expectations were only speculative. It reminded me of a plain McDonalds burger with the small chopped onions being one of the only things on the burgers other than the meat. The fries were nothing special. Not great but also without any major flaw. Straightforward French fries. Our meal was over in less than 10 min and we left feeling quite disappointed, and overall confused about the hype.  Guess it's just one of those things that you either get or you don't.  And I don't.",
