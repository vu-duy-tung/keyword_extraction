The breakfast burrito is delicious and whatever they do to those potatoes makes them super crispy on the outside, yet smooth and creamy on the inside!!! Hands down best potatoes this potato addict has tried!   I tried the queen bee late that everyone recommends and it was perfect. I expected it too be overwhelmingly sweet but it was just right ! Try this place and it will instantly be one of your faves !!!!",

Only reason I withheld a star is because my dish didn't come out until my company had completely finished theirs.

    "text": "Wow, I hate to be a party pooper here, but I was really disappointed in this place.  It was Father's Day and my Hubby and I found ourselves on the other side of town in search of brunch. I opened my trusty Yelp app and came across Neighbors. I saw all of the great reviews and thought it sounded great, so we headed in.   I dig the idea of this place - fast casual, order at a counter, open seating, etc. The food sounded good too so I was excited. I ordered the steak and eggs, which is and 8oz ribeye with housemade chimichurri, smashed potatoes and eggs. My hubby ordered the breakfast burrito, which he really enjoyed. I ordered an iced chai and he asked for black coffee and then we ordered the frittata for our daughter with an extra side of potatoes. We were given a number and found a seat, but weren't really given any instructions other than where we could find a high chair.  We took a seat and a few minutes later my latte was delivered. We mentioned to the server that we also ordered a black coffee and he pointed to a self serve station near the register (this would've been nice to know).  Our food was delivered and everything looked amazing! That is, until I cut into my steak. It was way undercooked - to the point where I was almost afraid to eat it. My Husband felt horrible and told me to send it back. I probably should have, but I ate what I could and enjoyed the potatoes and eggs and then just gave up. Nobody ever really checked to see if we were satisfied, so I also didn't have the opportunity to say anything and I didn't really want to wait forever for my meal to be remade.  Our breakfast (after adding a tip, which I don't think we should've done) was almost $60, which is more than we would spend at a traditional sit-down place. This just adds to my disappointment, since we had to get our own silverware, fill our own waters and coffee and my meal was not cooked properly. As I mentioned, my husband loved his burrito, but that is not enough for us to return. Although everyone we encountered was friendly, nobody ever checked back to ensure that we were satisfied with our food and that is unfortunate. Maybe I am being way too hard here, but I just didn't have the mind blowing experience so many others have mentioned.",

Service is nonexistent, just ppl working there going about their business and interacting with each other.  I ordered the old school breakfast and salmon toast. And a latte.   Scrambled eggs were folded...booooo Smashed potatoes were delicious  Sausage links were just unusual but tasty  Salmon toast....fail! Glob of salmon with garnishes that are more for looks than taste. Oh and all the delicious coffee reviews, nonsense, even Sbux is better.   This place had the right idea with poor execution. But someone please tell me why places like this still expect tips at the register??? Upfront even. Who am I tipping? I gave you my business and you gave me what I paid for... that requires gratuity??? I think not. At least give me the illusion that you are trying to earn it.",

Thanks to my son, I got introduced to this fabulous place! The food is always fresh and the menu is very expansive! I am currently working my way through the menu to try everything they have because everything they do have is so delicious and fabulous! It's always very fresh and creative! I highly recommend you try this place! Whether you want to eat breakfast or lunch, or just mix it up. Five stars for the menu selections, for the service and for the venue itself. This trip we had both breakfast and lunch. Their homemade soups are excellent, especially the pea soup and can't say enough about the fresh ingredients! So many in-house made teas and juices, etc. it's such a cute little place as well and always clean and the staff is always so friendly and helpful. Just go! Delish!",

The London Fog tastes a bit water down due to the ice but the hot always has a more pungent lavender flavor. It's just too hot outside for that right now.   In the past I have ordered the avocado toast for breakfast. Damn, it is SO GOOD. I got that with a latte and they did a cute design in the foam.   I shared a B.L.A.T.C (Bacon, Lettuce, Avocado , Tomato, Chicken) with my mom. We also got a side of sweet potato fries. The sandwich was pretty standard but what made it stand out was the pesto aioli that left it with a smooth and nutty flavor. If you have a pesto allergy, get it with the avocado crema (it tastes just as good!)  The sweet potato fries were crispy, salty, and satisfying. I couldn't stop eating them!",

They offer other styles of coffee drinks, tea, and brunch items. Great ambience to get together with your friends or family",

I definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area to try some delicious food.  The cafe was very open and spacious. The decor was very minimal but was very green because of all the surrounding plants they had in the vicinity. You order at the counter and they'll give you a little stand with your name on it where you're able to pick any table of your choosing.   I got the breakfast burrito and was amazing. Inside the burrito was lightly smashed potatoes, sausage and eggs and on the side was a chipotle ranch sauce which really enhanced the flavor of the potatoes and sausages very well.  My only complaint is that it can get pretty heavy and that they only sprinkle the pico de gallo on top and on the plate for decoration. If you need something to cut through the heaviness ask for more pico de gallo/salsa.  I had a taste of my friend's french toast and it was amazing. Super soft and pillowy, and  generous on the cinnamon but it's not overwhelmingly sweet.   The portions at Neighbors is very generous as well so you won't have to worry about small portions if you're coming in starving!",

The items I tried: coconut pancakes, avocado toast, breakfast sandwich and the fall pumpkin latte with coconut milk. Let me just tell you that it was wayyyy overpriced and for the taste, definitely not worth it. The breakfast sandwich and pancakes were ok, but the avocado toast was not good. It seemed like they used store bought guacamole on the toast. We told one of the employees we didn't like it and took it back and asked if we wanted anything else and so I asked for the raspberry white chocolate muffin to go. Honestly, the muffin wasn't that great either. Highly disappointed. I guess I won't be driving down this neighborhood in the future.",

There were 2 tables opened after we ordered our food.   Service, semi ok.  It was our first time here and nothing was special.  No one greets you when you come in or even noticed when you're looking for assists.  They didn't explain how things work.  Example, where the napkins and utensils were kept.  They were actually out of clean forks.  It would have been nice when the guy who dropped off our food would mention it to us.  It's obvious they weren't on our table.  The cashier didn't tell us either.   The food was ok, not bad.  Nothing I'm craving.  I'll come back another time see what they have.",

To begin with, the service is friendly and very helpful. The  prices are more than reasonable.  You go to the counter, look at their menu of a large array of choices,and you order and pay the same time. They bring everything to your table which is the table you choose, first come first serve, to sit at with your party. To start, I ordered a London fog lavender tea with almond milk and it was outstanding. I ordered the acai bowl made with fresh bananas and blueberries and oats and coconut and several other delicious additions and it was outstanding. The avocado toast is amazing with a side salad that you put on top as well as a over easy egg placed on top with it. Just delicious. The egg with sausage and toast is delicious as is the burrito. The breakfast sandwich made with eggs and sausage and Gruyere cheese, accompanied by fingerling crisp potatoes, is also delicious. The price is right and this place is absolutely delicious. We are so coming back here and I highly recommend it.",

When my coffee arrived after half of my sandwich was gone, there was lipstick on the cup (big turn off), I took it to the counter and they apologize and remade my drink, when I finally got it back, it sure was not worth the wait. The coffee did not have any flavor, very bland and not hot. Also, the toast on my sandwich was soggy and really did not WOW me (lack of flavor) and the potatoes were cold. I guess I ordered the wrong thing given the other reviews.  The overall appearance of the restaurant was nice and inviting with live plants everywhere. The downside was the noise level, given I was there on a Wednesday and just a few other customers, I can't imagine what it sounds like with it's full.  Not sure if I will give them another try.",

They are also very environmental friendly, everything's served in glass or ceramic, thank you so much for doing this.  Just couple things result in one star off....I feel they are not flexible on their order, in one of their order, we can pick either bacon or sausage, I ask them if I can do half and half so I know which one is my favorite next time I go, cashier immediately told me they can't do that...(ok....wow, is it really that hard?)   another time I order my meal with bacon, but they gave me sausage instead, I told them I ordered bacon and not sausage, so they took away my order, throw away those sausage and put bacon in it.....I just don't understand, rather than just throw away, why can't you just let your customer keep it(especially restaurant is the one who made the mistake and not the customer), please don't be so stingy, and you also ruin another perfect chance for your customer to try out what you have in your restaurant.  So in the end, I still don't know what their sausage taste like, I don't think I'll ever be able to find out....",

My husband's bacon burger was excellent, with good quality lettuce, tomato, and red onion. The french fries were just meh. I had the old school brekkie. Eggs were cooked perfectly, but the bacon was almost raw. Gross. I enjoyed the smashed taters and appreciated the bit of greens and tomatoes. The sourdough was nicely toasted but it didn't come with butter, so i asked for some. It was super cold which made it impossible to spread. Bummer.  We didn't try the coffee, but i know they use Vesta. We will come back to try it, and i hope it's as good as downtown's Vesta.",

My wife and I decided to make the short drive to visit Neighbors after a recommendation from our friend who was local.  The place is currently at a stand alone spot which is good in terms of parking.  Though it does get busy, there's tons of places to park.  The moment you walk in, you see who popular this place is.  I'm sure the majority of the customers that were in when I visited were locals but I could be wrong.  The smell of coffee was welcoming.  The layout of the dining area is perfect.  It allows rooms for people to eat comfortably, without banging elbows with their dining neighbors.  You order first then pick a place to sit.  Within minutes your food and drink are delivered to you.  There are several table options.  Small for a couple or large for a big group.  The food was really good and all natural.  The breakfast potatoes were surprisingly good too.  The portions are large enough to share if you get a plate.    I'll probably be back again when in town.  Kudos to Neighbors for offering a new place to enjoy brunch.  Give them a try.  You can thank me later.",

I was stuck between coconut pancakes, breakfast sandwich and breakfast burrito. I opted for the sandwich and it was fresh and tasty.

Bad because new customers might not see the storefront (but they will see the sign spinners!) but also good because for now, it's just my little spot that not too many people will flock to! lol.   My boyfriend and I absolutely love the decor inside. Minimalistic, sort of rustic, plants.. it just feels like you're not in Las Vegas. I wish there were outlets here and that they extended the hours because I would love to just study and work here on my laptop! Due to my work schedule I can only come here on the weekend mornings if I'm lucky!   The parking isn't too bad. The food is great, the drinks are great, the whole vibe here is great.

They offer a few breakfast dishes & different burgers/sandwiches. I played it safe & got a mushroom burger but I'm glad I did because it wasn't like any other mushroom burger I've tried. Very flavorful & the FRIES were thin & crispy just how I like it! Perfect place for caffeine lovers. I requested for something sweet & the guy suggested a plain old vanilla latte, but it was anything but that. It was actually pretty good!

My sister got 2-egg breakfast with turkey sausage and I wanted the beet salad with soup of the day (pea soup) and side of scrambled eggs. The food was fresh and I enjoyed it along with our two espresso drinks. They gave us a complimentary slice of cherry cheesecake and it tasted fresh and homemade. I definitely recommend this neighborhood spot!",

Walked up to the register and I ordered my coconut pancakes and matcha latte, the hubs ordered some breakfast wrap. They give you a sign with your name on it and you find a place to sit. Most of the tables are the larger community tables so if it's busy, get comfortable and maybe make a friend :)  My coconut pancakes were really good but at one point the compote got to be too sweet so I just ate the pancakes and the coconut flakes and some sort of cream on top. Could've used more of the creamy goodness but they weren't as generous on that as they were with the compote. My matcha had a weird, almost fishy taste to it. Kinda weird but I drank it anyway.   We'll be back. There are more items I wanna try!",

It's half serve yourself and half they serve you. For not having your own personal waiter, they were all still very attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is very cool and fresh but can get a little echoey and loud when it's full due to the minimalist look of the walls and their high ceiling. Sometimes, it's the price you pay. I think it's worth it. The food was great! My son and I both got what resembles a Persian omelet, with tomatoes and egg. It had a little heat which I'd have them add more next time but perfect for my 8 year old. The lavender latte was incredible! I'm so glad I tried it! It may be something I just stop in for! The one minor issue I had is that my son finished his toast with his sashuka fairly quickly. The line was too long to stand in again for just toast but All in all, the place and food were lovely. We will return!",

The salmon came out first and it was pair with a fresh  salad. Loved the dressing in the salad. It was refreshing. The salmon was delicious was well. It was fresh and not fishy taste. I liked the cucumber and cherry tomato on top of it. It was a well balanced dish. Our steak and  egg came out as well and it was delicious as well. The potatoes was soft and cooked well.

Entirely different from everything else we had seen in Vegas, which is what we were hoping to find!   The location is interesting. If we didn't find it on yelp, we never would've never noticed this place and could have easily just driven right by. It looked like a closed building at first glance.   I was surprised to find that it's not one of those places that has a cool atmosphere but not so great coffee and food. We LOVED our breakfast and the coffee. Generous portions, everything tasted like it was made from scratch and they knew what they were doing.   Love that they have take away coffee cups and to go boxes right at the counter. Makes it so easy!  Food came out really quick and the staff was really friendly. Clean bathrooms (which I have to note, because it's important!), nice spacious open and well lit restaurant.   I could definitely see us coming back here next time we visit, because it's great to get away from the strip and relax and recharge there.",

Also had the portobello wrap bc it was the only vegan option they had for my sister and a cold brew! The restaurant itself is really cute with wood tables and plants at the entrance as well as a wall of plants and succulents which are my fav! The reason for the 4 stars is the lack of variety in the food for all people weather you eat meat or not as well as healthier options and a tiny bit over priced. In the end it is worth checking out and customer service is good.",

They were very good but came to the table barely warm with cold butter and barely warm syrup and way too much powdered sugar.  The Chai Latte was weak and  only warm not hot. The pour your own refill was great, food came fast and staff was friendly. Minuses: Some order takers provided incorrect info when asked about menu items.   Despite the minuses I may give them another try sometime.",

Besides if your in good company, it really doesn't matter. It's different in that you order your food like you would at a fast food joint, but they serve you like a restaurant. Kinda reminds me of the way Carl's Jr. use to be back in the day, where you would be given a number to be placed at your table and then they would bring the food to you. It's a nice concept, verses waiting for a server who may take some time to you because other things are detaining them.",

My mom and her friend shared the breakfast sandwich. That thing is huge! And they said it tasted very good.  My dad got the muesli and he enjoyed it too.  We are all super happy about our meals and coffee.  The ambience is great and the staff is real friendly too! I hope my new friend at the front desk gets his hair to his hair color goals!

Recently opened Neighbors definitely fits right in with all the other solid brunch options in the southwest area. I did make a joke about the business sign facing oncoming traffic looking more like an ad for real estate, rather than a hipster brunch spot , but not holding it against anyone, lol.   Ambiance and service were great. Spacious dining area with plant life, wooden details on the hardware are a nice aesthetic. Attentive and prompt servers. Self-serve water.   I'd give the food a 4.9, only because I felt my Acai bowl was a little too watery, texture-wise. But it was a good bowl.  Breakfast burrito was awesome, pancakes were top notch.  I tried the Queen Bee Latte and an Iced Matcha Latte. Both were really good.   Next time I'm in town, I'll definitely be back!",

I ordered the avocado toast because I can't seem to ever pass that up and it was good although the avocado was a bit over masked for my liking and need a bit of salt/pepper (personal taste) the poached egg on it was cooked to perfection. I'm not a big poached egg person but this one was nice, light and cheesy so whoever made that knows what they're doing. Ordered a side of bacon to go with and that was like cold, hard fence posts... bacon isn't hard to do just please don't overlook it like that. I was like eating cardboard so not finished. Overall atmosphere was ok but with so many hard surfaces it was was a bit on the loud side. We sat in a corner and could hard hear one another sitting across from each other and this was during the week so I can't imagine how it would be on the weekend.",

The match latte is quite nice, slightly sweet but not cloying, balancing well with the slight earthiness of matcha.  The steak and eggs was solid though I wouldn't say it was spectacular (hence four stars and not five). The steak itself was ok, just not particularly memorable. The accompanying eggs and smashes potatoes were nicely done though.  Overall, it is a nice breakfast and lunch spot that I would definitely go back to again.",

I had the french toast and the beet salad. I love the granola and the strawberry, they add the prefect crunch, sweetness and tartness to the french toast. The beet salad has good flavor, the argula is prefectly dressed, beet is cooked nicely (not to soft and not too firm) and the feta on top adds a great saltness to tue whole dish!    Overall I have great experiences here. Lovely atmosphere, delicious food and friendly staffs. I'll definitely be back!",

The modern design with all the neutral colors, wood accents, and live plants make for a real relaxing environment to start your day off with.  We started our brunch with the Steak and Eggs and Chics and Waffles. The Steak and Eggs were good. The  temperature on both the eggs and steak were spot on. The chimichurri sauce was mild in flavor, but I didn't mind it because I got to taste more of the flavor of the meat. I got to taste a bit of the chicken which was also good.  There are lots of other things on the menu that piqued my interest. The next time I visit Neighbors I will try some of their healthier options because they look awesome in all of these Yelp photos.",

We decided to go together on a Monday morning for breakfast so he could try it.  This visit was disappointing. He ordered the old school breakfast. He also got an order of French toast. I got the acai bowl. He was disappointed at the prices. The french toast didn't come with anything, that's why he ordered the breakfast too. His eggs came out first. Then my bowl about five minutes later. He never got the french toast. When he mentioned it to the server, the server went & got a copy of the receipt & showed him he wasn't charged for french toast. I heard him order it so... We also found it irritating that we kept having to walk to the counter over & over for silverware, napkins, water, coffee, ketchup, etc. Every time we'd sit down we'd realize we needed something else. The toast that came with his breakfast was served dry. He had to ask for butter. There was no offer of jelly or anything like that. The food server was running around like crazy with no help.  Sort of disappointed this time around. My lunch was better & more reasonably priced. I don't recommend it for breakfast.",

As soon as we arrived an employee greeted us and gave us the regular menu as well as the summer menu. Since it was my first visit I appreciated getting the menu ahead of making it to the counter. All of the employees that I encountered that day were friendly. My lunch and drink were prepared quickly and delivered to my table.   The Lavender Lemonade was a unique menu item and refreshing. The lavender was just a hint and added to the flavor of the delicious lemonade. The Chipotle Chicken Sandwich was very good. All of the flavors with the grilled chicken were perfect together. There were several choices of bread and I went with a grain bread that was delicious. The sandwich was not only delicious, but a lighter choice that didn't make me feel guilty.   Overall, a great experience! Great food, interesting menu options, and great service are the perfect combination.",

When you first walk in, it is a bit confusing because the food menu isn't posted, only the coffees. We had to find a spare menu on the tables and bring it to the register to order. After we ordered, we found a table quickly despite it being a packed house. Luckily they have a very large spare dining room to accommodate their long line. This restaurant lost a star due to customer service and timeliness of food delivery. The food runner dropped half of the order and then brought the second half 15 minutes later. We asked her for waters on her first drop and asked for ketchup on her second.  She laughed in my friends face and said \"seriously is that it?\" It was so shocking that we stared at her in disbelief that she literally laughed-our-loud at us. I will give this place another try because the food was good, it was clean and easily accessible.",

Fast forward another 5 visits you can say I'm a fan. I really like the chipotle chicken sandwich here. The fries are pretty good too. My boyfriend usually changes it up. He liked the mushroom burger the most though.   The service is kind of slow. Sometimes it's hard to get the persons attention that is serving the food.   When you walk in you put your order in at the counter and they give you a sign with your name, which is a nice touch. It really confuses the servers because some people have the same name (obv). They might want to consider putting the last initial as well to help the process.   The cafe itself is super cute and clean. If you're nearby def give this place a try. I probably wouldn't drive across town for it though.",

They do have Vegan, Vegetarian and GF options, which is a wonderful touch and makes the dining experience easier on those with such preferences.  You are expected to seat yourself, grab your own waters & coffee but still pay $12 for French toast. Your order takes place at a bar and is prepared and delivered from the open kitchen, which I love.   There were 6 of us. Our two kids (age 7) shared the French toast with a side of fruit from the kids menu with no problems.  The food overall was good. The concept though, is kind of strange. *shrugs shoulders*  Also, the entry is full of plants. Which I personally find attractive and impressive since everything I touch dies. Lol",

    "text": "Found this place from the Yelp app. Yay! Score another one for Yelp! Located in an out of the way office building, we passed three other breakfast places getting here. Those three had good reviews on Yelp, but this one sounded intriguing. MUCH bigger than you'd think, you order at the counter, then have a seat while they bring the food out to you. There were quite a few items on the menu, so we sat down first to peruse the menu. Water and drip-coffee are serve yourself at the counter. Nice glass glasses for the water, and ceramic mugs for the coffee (with lots of fixings, not just cream and sugar).  I didn't see soda, nor a soda machine, but the menu board above the ordering counter listed it, so maybe?  The food was FANTASTIC! Definitely not fast food, we had to wait about ten minutes, but WORTH IT!  I had a breakfast sandwich on multi-grain bread. My wife had a frittata. Both were tasty and came with greens, so we felt healthy! Actually, the greens that came with the sandwich were out-of-this-world good! I asked and they said they make their own honey dijon dressing. It's just a bit of sweetness in a light vinaigrette dressing. AMAZING! They should bottle it for sale!  Customer service was really nice, as people came by often to check on us. A quiet atmosphere and delightful decorations within, we can't WAIT to go back!",

The space itself has more of a restaurant feel to it. It is very loud as there are no walls to separate the kitchen from the dining area.  The employees were... nice? although stern and to the point. No conversation was made with the guests. The food runner did not smile nor did he introduce the food to the table.  It is a nice spot but I do believe that it could use some improvement.",

First off, I'm not a big fan of ordering at the counter, I prefer the standard waiter/waitress taking our order, but this wasn't too bad.  The main complaint is the wait in line to order.  After that, the servers were very prompt and accommodating.  I had the steak & eggs, it was excellent.  The steak was cooked perfectly med rare, the eggs over easy and the chimichurri sauce was outstanding.  I'd drink a cup of their sauce.  My wife and grandson had the breakfast burrito and the Old School breakfast, both were excellent.  Overall:  an outstanding place for breakfast or lunch.",

F&B I thought was food was okay; it can use some improvement. I am pretty sure the vegetables in my winter protein bowl were cross-contaminated.. My friend who is a picky eater wasn't a fan of her dish, but she has been several times before me despite warning us of a certain item that she had in the past that she wasn't a fan of. She overall enjoys it here and I can see why. I wanted to like Neighbors more than I did. The drinks here were perfect. I ordered a seasonal raspberry mocha that was sweet and delicious. My friend's chai was also top notch.  Service This was also just okay for me. It's as if they wanted to create a cafeteria disguised as an adorable restaurant and avoided hiring hosts and actual servers. Good workplace for introverts!  Overall To be honest, outside of the cute decor and tasty drinks, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. I am willing to give this place another shot a few months down the road because I think this place has the potential to be an excellent diner.",

After receiving our food it was nearly impossible to locate an employee to request additional assistance (of course i didn't want to walk to the register) .   The French Toast presentation was definitely five star worthy, however the taste was underwhelming. The syrup was minimal and the overall taste was just okay at best.  Shakshuka was a pleasant surprise to the menu. Saucy, a little spicy, seasoned with cumin served in a skillet full of messy deliciousness for the win! If your adventurous I'd highly recommend this Israeli/Middle Eastern inspired (I'll let you decide which) anytime of day tomato, chili peppers and poached egg dish!      Nearly $40 for two...",

I had the coconut pancakes ( I don't even like pancakes) but these were really appealing to me due to the coconut, blueberry and lemon components. The were wonderful , please have them non pancake lovers. My friend ordered the granola French toast and those were really good. Very comforting and basic however not boring. I recommend those also.   They stole my heart due to having a lavender latte. I love all food things with lavender and it was really good.

The potatoes they put in there are so good, the eggs were fluffy, the sausage tasted so fresh and the tortilla was good quality. I also got the coconut pancakes but I wasn't a fan of them. They had some kind of berry syrup on it that I didn't like. My husband got the steak and eggs. The eggs were fluffy, it had the same potatoes as in my burrito and the steak was very juicy and soft. I will definitely recommend people here! The customer service was great! Everyone was extremely nice and they kept checking on us to make sure everything was good or if we needed anything.",

The waiters here don't come up to your table, you order at the counter and they bring the food to you. I ordered the berry quinoa salad ($10) with smoked salmon on the side ($5) and a mint lemonade ($4). My brother ordered a pina burger with sweet potato fries ($13) and also a side of smoked salmon. All together we spent about $40. The smoked salmon definitely wasn't worth $5. The food was pretty tasty though. The sweet potato fries were just the right amount of crispy and the burger was really unique. The salad was alright though because it was missing some flavor by itself. This cafe is pretty cute though, I see myself coming back again.",

I'm only giving 4 stars because they boast being vegan but only offer two small vegan options. They should at least include a meal that is vegan if they want to include vegan on their menu.

To be honest this kind of dish is fairly new to me I have never tried it before but I don't regret it either. It was very delicious.  My bf ordered the coconut pancakes, OMG let me tell you I've never been a big fan on pancakes but this was amazing. The zest of lemon, the sweetness of the coconut, and the tartness of the berry syrup. It's like a vacation in your mouth. I'm just blown away on how it tasted so good. I highly recommend it! They had a variety of teas and lattes to choose from. I also saw they had some fresh juices to choose from as well. I ordered the Queen B latte which was the perfect taste of honey and cinnamon. The vibe and setting there was comfortable, peaceful and happy. We will definitely come back again.",

The menu looked to have a number of interesting dishes but I went with the Pina burger and a iced been tea. For those two things it nearly set me back $20 yikes! I would not have guessed that judging by the location and the actual portion size of the food.   The burger was not bad, the pineapple and charred burger patty was tasty, I just wish it was bigger for the cost. The sweet potatoes fries didn't have any seasoning that was detectable.   The biggest let down though was that all of the waiters was standing at the counter with there backs to the dinning area 95% of my meal.   I needed napkins bc the egg told had got in my beard lol... after waiting for a few minutes I noticed these gilts never gave the customers and I just walked up to them to ask for them.  Next when my ice tea went empty not one person ever came by my table the entire meal. If your going to charge $3.5 for a simple glass of ice tea. Please refill it.    Interestingly this place solicites tips before you get your food. I hate this as most of the time the service is really lacking because they think, hey I already got mine!!! Funny thing on the screen the options was 10% 20% 30%.  Well I did want to try the pancakes but I doubt that will happen. If your in a burger mood Bachi nails the menu better. And if you want a coffee well maybe this place is for you.",

I to had to get up not once but twice to get utensils. I'm not really sure about the two guys that stood up front and their positions. The only thing I could see was that they brought my plate to me and handed off the bags to the Uber and Doordash drivers. Maybe this is a futuristic place that caters mainly to pickups orders because it seems as though the guest inside were pretty much invisible.",

    "text": "Finally went and tried out the place. Very easy to find as it was directly across from my friend's house.   The space is gorgeous! Open floor plan, cute wooden tables and the decor is very clean. Love the greenery in the room. The big windows for sunlight makes for great pictures.  Food was decent. I ordered the pancakes which were very light, fluffy and flavorful. Definitely didn't need syrup with the house made sauce they put on it.   My friend's steak and eggs were greatly presented. Never been a fan of precut steak as I love to cut it myself, but their presentation of stacking it like a jenga stack was a breath of fresh air from the nornal sliced at an angle and fanned out on the plate like most places do with precut steak. Chimichurri was good. Their rainbow smashed fingerling potatoes reminded me too much of CRAFTkitchen's smashed breakfast potatoes. However, theirs could not hold a candle to the aforementioned restaurant. The potatoes lacked the crunchiness and creaminess. And the marinade made it look messy, not clean on the plate.  My friend who ordered their breakfast burrito, I am just a person of aesthetics... for the price he paid, I'm sure the cooks could've rolled that burrito tighter and actually put more filling... you can definitely tell there was no care put in to that burrito of how flattened it looked. I've rolled enough burritos and sandwich wraps to know how much filling and care goes in to making one.  All of the food was overshadowed by service. I'm sorry, if you're going to provide a refill service your tea, at least be attentive to your floor. Just as it was pictured in another review, servers still had their backs towards their guests. I understand it's not a full service restaurant, but if I'm going to pay for a $3.75 glass of tea that isn't that big to begin with, people do expect a refill. I'm fine with refilling my water. I do it whenever I am at Crepe Expectations.. but even if you moved to refillable teas as the server made a point to inform me, \"Oh I'm sorry, we just changed from non free refills to free refills,\" then please don't keep your back to your guests and just stand there with your elbow on the counter chatting away with your coworker.   On another off the subject, I now understand their 15% option on their payment for tips. Here's a tip for those complaining about the service after paying: don't pay the tip on the card of you're hell bent on complaining why the tip option is available (based on another reviewer complaining about it). You can easily put no tip and just leave money on the table.   I'll still come and check out the rest of the food, because it was great. Just like Pho Saigon 8 in Henderson: you know you're going to get bad service but you suck it up for the good food (however, their service has improved as of late - the server who ignores you doesn't work there anymore haha). I am in the area frequently so yes I will still support because of the good food, but I hope service standards get improved upon.",

The line is intimidating but actually not that bad. The food comes out efficiently and quickly, too. The place is green and welcoming. We ordered the French Toast with their granola, strawberries, and honey butter. That granola is addicting. We also tried the corned beef hash with crispy potatoes in a hot skillet. Such unique flavors! The queen bee latte was also balanced with the honey and cinnamon notes. A fun place with a good energy.",

I ordered the breakfast sandwich and swapped out the chipotle mayo for the garlic aioli. The sandwich was flavorful and the ingredients perfectly complemented each other. The side of potatoes were extra crispy and tasted more like chips. They were probably the best potatoes I've ever had. I also tried the queen bee's latte. It sounded unique, but it was actually kind of basic.   Overall, a lovely place for brunch with outstanding food.",

    "text": "My friend and I were together earlier in the day and were wondering what to eat for lunch. Since we don't have the chance that often, and it was a Sunday, I offered up the idea of brunch since she loves breakfast foods. Considering our work schedules and tend to want to wake up so early on off days, breakfast foods is not often an option.   When we had looked up brunch, this was one of the new places we didn't recognize and it was close by, so here we went for a new brunch experience.  Located just south of Russell and Ft Apache, Neighbors is located in the east half of a standalone building (totally thought they took the entire building until we walked in). Process is pretty simple. Go up to the counter to order and take a seat at a table of your choosing. To my own surprise, it wasn't as busy as I had expected.   Menu is small but fairly wide in variety. My friend had gotten the 'Old School' with orange juice while i had 'Steak & Eggs' with a cappuccino. After paying, we were given a tag where they write your name vs a generic number tag to place on your table. Don't poke at the writing as it comes off easily. A regretful idea my friend dealt with.. hehe !   One thing we didn't know is you grab your own waters, utensils, napkins, and accompaniments (sauces) next to the order area. Didn't find that out until we got our food and asked the waiter who delivered.   The 'Steak & Eggs' is a 8 oz ribeye topped with chimichurri sauce, smashed potatoes, farm eggs, and toast.   Mildly splurged a little due to the rare occassion. Of course the steak had to be medium rare with over-easy eggs. Toast? Sourdough ! Steak was pre-sliced and stacked w/ layed chimichurri sauce. Not a perfect cook but still tender and juicy. Chimichurri sauce is one of my favorite sauces to go with a steak, if any sauce is used overall. The smashed potatoes was surprisingly yummy. Small boiled potatoes w/ skin cooked again on a skillet (this is all a guess) and pressed to break the skin and create some crispy fried aspects to the edges. This is something i've been wanting to try and it was pretty yummy ! Eggs were perfectly cooked. Sourdough bread was amazing ! one of the better sourdough breads i've had. Crispy but not too hard exterior with a soft chewy interior. Great top mop up some of that chimichurri sauce w/ the rich runny egg yolk  The 'Old School\" consists of 2 farm eggs any style, choice of double smoked bacon or sausage, smashed potatoes, and toast  Over medium eggs w/ choice of half smoked bacon and half sausage, and sourdough bread !  She said the bacon was a bit overcooked and hard to eat. The sausage was really yummy. Reminds me of a style of breakfast sausage. Very juicy and flavorful.  We both thoroughly enjoyed this bread and is highly recommended to anyone who tries this place out. The plating of the food is amazing (IG worthy hehe) and the portion size for the price is good. As another reviewer had said, cali style, vegas prices ! Heck ya !   Oh ! forgot to mention our drinks. OJ was nice and yummy. Drank it after having my cappuccino so made it taste sweeter than it should be. Nice amount of pulp too ! Cappuccino was pretty decent with a nice heart design in the foam. Fairly strong but tasty. Size wise of the cappuccino was mildly on the smaller side though. OJ was pretty good in size.   I wanted to order coconut pancakes too but being two people and our small stomachs for the first meal of the day, yeah that definitely wouldn't work. Next time maybe?   Friend had mentioned people complaining about the overall noise of the restaurant. I feel like its fairly normal. Open kitchen. Open dining room. What you expect? A library?",

The line gave me time to figure out what I wanted to order, but it moved pretty quickly. The menu is kept simple, which I like. You order your food, find your own table, then the servers will find your name tag and deliver the food to ya. Again, it was a short wait before we were grubbin. I got the Shakshuka with sourdough bread and an iced lavender latte. I rate the Shakshuka a 5 out of 5 and the lavender latte 3 out of 5. Prices are reasonable and it had a fresh atmosphere inside with succulents everywhere. I think everyone was taking pictures with em....even myself lol! It's kind of tucked away hidden so make sure you don't drive past it like I did.",

    "text": "I was really excited when I found out that this place finally opened (I drove past it a lot when it was under construction). When I visited, it was on a super busy Sunday afternoon. As some reviews have mentioned, you walk up to the counter to order first then find your own table, much like how Panera does it. I wish they would change this because it does get quite chaotic when it's busy like how it was when I visited. There were a bunch of people standing around eyeing for the next open table, and it was confusing as to where the order line started.   Onto the food!  Matcha latte: Omg. I'm in love with this latte. I want to marry it...that's how good it is to me. I'm super picky when it comes to matcha and this place definitely got it just right. It had a nice hint of sweetness and a strong green tea flavor. You just have to try it especially if you love matcha!  Shashuka: this is a dish of 2 eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, red peppers, and onions. Feta cheese is also sprinkled throughout. Comes with slices of your choice of bread for dipping (I got sourdough). I pretty much ate the whole thing because it was just that good! The flavors of all the ingredients were wonderful and the red peppers gave it a nice little kick.   I will definitely be back for another visit. I have my eye on the lavender latte and the Queen bee latte!",

    "text": "I found this restaurant through an instagram influencer that I follow. Without her post I would never have tried this place. My first visit was great. I liked the atmosphere and the food was great. Since then, I have eaten there several times. I took my husband once (he says it's girl food so he won't go again), I took my grown kids there and I've even eaten there by myself a few times when I had no one to go with. I've even ordered delivery. I joined their rewards program, etc. Today I went with some family to show off this cute place down the street by where I live. I am aware that they are a breakfast and lunch place so I checked the time and I was good. We would have 30 minutes to grab a quick bite. I said hello, grabbed menus and found a table to read their menu. I then went to the counter and placed my order. The girl asked if the 2 sandwiches I was ordering would be the same I said yes and then she asked if I was having g a salad fries or sweet potato fries and so I said one with sweet potato fries and one with a salad and then the girl rudely said, so they are different not the same order, (ok )then I had my sister tell her what she and her son wanted. I then pulled a $100 bill to pay and she weirdly and rudely huddled with 2 other workers (pretty sure one was a manager)and whispered...she took a while and I'm just waiting there.....patiently. She then gives me my total and says this will all be to go, is that ok? I said no, you close at 3pm. She said oh but we close in 25 minutes so it all has to be a to go order. I looked around and they had  at least 5 other tables with customers. I told the girl, you know, maybe you need to change your store hours if you're going to do that because I got here at 2:30, that's plenty of time if you close at 3.  She said...oh no, we do close at 3 but it will all be to go right now. What?! I mean c'mon ....it doesn't say we close at 3pm and between 2:30-3pm we are solely a to go restaurant. Needless to say I am very disappointed. I have noticed their service has been in decline but that was not right. All the people that were already seated may have easily stayed there until 3pm for all I know. I have worked in the service industry for years and I would never consider being so unprofessional to my customers. My mother even noticed a cook looking pretty pissed that we were ordering.  I've been there. I've hoped customers wouldn't show up on my last hour so I could go home on time but I never put on an attitude or made my customers uncomfortable. I actually was super helpful so that my customers would not feel rushed or feel bad for coming in. There are store hours for a reason and its your job to service your customers. (I did nothing wrong and did not deserve that)That's how you guys make money and pay your wages. I no longer work and I love going out to eat but I guess I'm done with this place. I'll take my money to a better establishment that values having good customers like me.",

    "text": "Neighbors opened just a couple weeks ago. It's a hip modern-style cafe; upon walking in you're entering a large walkway area to the order station. If you take a look around while walking up to the cashier you'll notice it's somewhat of a minimalistic style, simple but eye-catching and decorated with greenery.   I came here mainly for coffee, and found out their coffee menu is also very minimalistic -- definitely not a bad thing because as they say, less is more right? They have a Queen Bee latte sweetened with honey and topped with cinnamon that tastes amazingggg. My friend jovi got an iced mocha latte which, as simple as can be, was made to perfection. It tasted amazing as well! Now moving on to the food menu, found on the back of their paper menu rather than the board. More extensive than the coffee menu and offering a few vegan choices as well (for those of your interested). I have yet to try a vegan option on their menu, maybe on my next visit.   I've visited Neighbors twice (with jovi) during their grand opening and ordered the mushroom burger on the first visit and the salmon toast on the second visit. The presentation of the food definitely fit the modern, millennial style of the cafe (even most of the employees fit into that type of \"style\" if that makes sense). One bite of the mushroom burger and OH MY GOODNESS  it was made with a beef patty and topped with onions and a bun with some kind of aioli sauce if I remember correctly. Jovi ordered the avocado toast, and I declined her offer to try a bite since my mouth was too busy with my burger, but she could not get over how good it was either! The second visit with my salmon toast and a side of greens also left me  it was basically their version of a lox bagel but on a slice of sourdough instead. Still bomb. am definitely going to visit again and again.",

The employees are super friendly and can answer any question you may have about the wide variety of food and coffees offered. They were all super excited about the opening of the restaurant and being able to serve the community a healthier food option! No matter what you order you'll get a deal.   I had the breakfast sandwich which was absolutely amazing. The presentation just added to the experience. It was by far the best sandwich of any kind I have had in months. I'm not big on spice, but this sandwich had a little kick to it which put it over the top. Not too strong, just enough to throw your taste buds for a loop. I chose a side salad with it (yea I know it was breakfast but I'm trying to be good!) the salad was super fresh and had a unique spin on it. The dressing was fantastic!! Wish I had the recipe but I guess that means I'll have to come back in for more!!  Overall the experience was fantastic and I will be going back! My advice to the employees and managers is to keep it up and keep it about the food experience. Don't get caught up in the penny pinching as your food is too good to cut corners with ingredients and effort. Quality over quantity will win every time. I have no doubt this place will take off and be the go to healthy option for the community!",

    "text": "You can easily tell that Neighbors goes the extra mile. Fresh ingredients are paramount. All breakfast dishes are flavorful and avoid the heavy oils commonly used in many breakfast restaurant kitchens. Their kind and competent staff, quality ingredients, variety of healthy options, and lax atmosphere make weekend brunches a hit every time.  Pancakes were REAL good. A little small in size but fluffy and full of all the right flavors. The Arugula side salad had very fresh greens dressed in a citrus vinaigrette that struck a balance between light and sweet. Everything I want out of a side salad. Their house potatoes easily passed my checklist for a great breakfast potato: crispy and well seasoned. The eggs were cooked to my liking and the pork tasted great.     \"Everything just tastes fresh and good\" - my gf",

    "text": "This place is okay. The woman at the register was nice. I hate that I'm pushed to tip when I pay at the register, but I have to get my own water and utensils? Stupid. My food didn't come out together, the soup and quesadilla came out separate which was weird because I hadn't ordered the soup as a beginning course, but part of the main meal. The food tasted good, I had the tomato soup with a steak quesadilla and fruit cup. Fruit cup was nice, had a lot of berries which is a good sign. The soup was good, solid tomato soup with basil. The quesadilla tasted good, but was way too much for a single serving. Like, I'm not a freaking lumberjack, this is one meal. Tone it down, save on costs and waste, maybe charge a little less. Also the plating was boring. It looked so plain and kinda sad. Just stacked on itself, no sides or prettying up with a sauce on the plate or anything. *sigh* I may be spoiled by LA brunches, but if I'm gonna pay that much, I expect better. The atmosphere is okay. No music that I could hear. Upscale brunch crowd on a Monday morning, all the children I saw were well behaved, which was nice. Would I come here again? Probably not. It felt uninspired and expensive. $25 for one person to eat (plus undeserved tip - no one even checked to make sure the food was good, just brought it out and cleaned up). For a place called Neighbors, they certainly skimp on interaction.",

    "text": "We decided to try out this new spot for breakfast while taking a break from running errands. First impression: this place is fancy! Liked the ambiance - green plants, sunlight and wooden tables. When we walked in, we were greeted by the friendly employees. One of them handed us their regular and summer menus. I panicked a little because their food seemed way too complicated for me. Since I'm petty and not a big fan of breakfast food, I prefer to keep things simple. Saw that they had something called the Corned Beef Smash on the summer menu, which got me excited, but of course it had stuff that I didn't like - bell peppers and onions. Figured these would be pre-mixed just like all the other restaurants who serve this dish. But to my surprise, they told me that they can make it without them. CoolCoolCoolCoolCool!   This is an order-at-the-counter-and-sit-down kind of place. While we were waiting, one of the employees brought utensils to our table. When the food arrived, I was impressed. Very nice presentation! This wasn't your usual looking canned version of corned beef hash (see picture). It was smaller potatoes and corned beef cut in perfect portions, topped with chimichurri and served in a skillet! On a side note, there was also supposed to be an egg on top. I asked for it on the side and gave it to my husband since I don't eat \"visible\" eggs other than in fried rice, LOL. Overall, it was good, but the chimichurri overpowered the dish. At the end, it felt like I was just drinking vinegar or something. Ugh. Maybe they should consider cutting it down a bit? My husband ordered the Old school and said it tasted alright. If you are looking for simple, this one is probably it because it comes with toast, eggs, bacon/sausage and potatoes.  Cool cafe with friendly service, but unfortunately I'm not about the fancy breakfast/brunch food. Glad to see they are doing well though!",

The place has a cute, stylish design, and you can see the hot air balloons flying off in the distance (if they are flying)  Two of us grabbed breakfast before hiking at Red Rock.  We ordered 2 portorritos.  They were good but the burrito is all that comes on the plate.  For $12, it would be really nice to throw in a side of beans, salad, fruit, or something. (- one star)     Add on 2 almond milk lattes and you have a $36 breakfast.  A bit pricey for  a Vegas breakfast, in my opinion.",

And the latte was yummy too. The regular latte is very plain and does not taste that great. But I also tried the vegan \"fun guy\" burger which was delicious, for it being vegan there was a lot of flavor to it. The service is quick, did not have to wait long for our food to be served.

    "text": "Love the aesthetics of this place but everything else is just meh. First off, there is literally two gluten free vegan options on the menu, so I was forced to choose between the two. An acai bowl without the granola as it wasn't gluten free. You're really losing out on business with such a limited menu for people that eat vegan or gluten free. Even if you're just vegan you have about two options. For such a new place I was surprised of the lack of choices. Either way the acai bowl was just ok, already a bit melted when it got to me. The service wasn't great either. The cashier was super friendly but the guy that brought us the food barely said two words and didn't offer silverware or napkins. When we went to grab some, there were no napkins or silverware left. I just think that when it's busy they may get a little bit distracted. It's also super loud in here if there are a lot of people due to the hard floors, I literally could barely hear my mom over the screaming kids. My parents enjoyed their food so definitely has great options for those that aren't vegan. I probably will only be back for tea or coffee on a not so busy day as it's a cute spot in general.",

    "text": "My parents wanted brunch so we came here bc it was close to us and it had good reviews. The inside decor is really cute with a lot of natural sunlight. When we got inside, this tall blonde girl gave us four menus and told us to sit wherever. After about ten minutes, we realized we're supposed to go up to the cashier to order and pay. I wish the girl had told us instead of us waiting and awkwardly staring at her. She didn't come to our table to ask us if this was our first time, what's popular, nothing. After we ordered, we waited for our food and it was pretty quick. The food was really good and the presentation of it was really pretty. We got steak&eggs, BLAT, and coconut pancakes. Pretty good I must say. Right when we got our food, the blonde girl asked if we needed anything and that was it. She never came to us again until the end to get our dirty plates. Towards the end of the meal, my mom asked her if we can get refills on our drinks while she was taking the plates away. She said yeah and walked away. Yeah and then she never came back. So my mom was trying to get her attention and even yelled excuse me once (embarrassing lol) and she didn't look at us at all. Even when she went to the area where she grabs the food to give to customers, her back was to us the entire time. Kind of felt like she was doing it on purpose. So I felt like she ruined the whole experience for us. In the future, I feel like this is a to go type place bc the food was so good tho! So four stars for food but two stars knocked down bc of the blonde girl. Been a minute since I wrote a review but she truly annoyed me. Unless this is a real hipster place and it's always like this, then it just didn't suit me and my family.",

We had to figure out that this is a place where we have to get our own utensils, water, refills, napkins, and whatever we may need with our meal, after the food order is placed at the front counter. The confusing part is that there is usually one or two food servers that seem to only drop off the food and drink at the table without any utensils , then never come back, but are still tipped. Besides the semi-service, this place closes at 3 p.m. It would be nice if this place extended their business hours, at least on the weekend.",

Only took a few awkward moments to realize there is no hostess and you order at the counter. After ordering there were no instructions on the open seating or the self serve area (right next to the register you pick up utensils, napkins, complimentary water, condiments, etc) I think this should explained, this is not a typical cafe procedure. No biggie, just should to be explained. I ordered the Avo (avocado toast), side of fruit, and tea. Food arrived quickly and is high quality. Unfortunately I was eating solo or I would have more to write about. The Avo is well balanced, poached egg was perfect, and the dressing on the greens was divine. Side of fruit had all the goodies (not just boring melon) -blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries. I'm definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu.",

We saw a line to the cashier but were not sure if the line were for to-go or dine-in. My wife and I decided to get in the line (15 plus people). After 30 min of waiting in line, we came to find out that after we order, we have to wait approximately 25 min to have a table. At this time, there were about 8 people standing around who ordered already but without a table. We angrily left the restaurant without ordering anything. I am not in the restaurant business but this place is poorly run. I believe there should be someone at the door to figure out if the customers were dining in or ordering to-go. If it's dining in, tell them how long the wait and assign them tables before they walk up to the cashier to order or direct them directly to the cashier if ordering to-go. I think if they can make some improvements on this aspect of the restaurant, I might give them another try.",

One side of bacon which consists of two pieces for 3 dollars was very small and thin. I don't know how the hell it was double smoked.

I shared the breakfast burrito as well as the Coconut Pancakes.  Both of these dishes were large and in charge.  I was blasted with fantastic flavors from the pancakes.  The toasted coconut chips with the blueberry lemon sauce made for a delectable breakfast.  The fresh blueberries were abundant making it an awesome stack of pancakes!  Of course the breakfast burrito was filled with so many great items~ eggs, sausage, smashed potatoes, cheese, pico, and avocado crema.  It is certainly a huge burrito that can get you through the day.    I can't write this review without praising the service.  The line can get very long especially on the weekend.

On a weekday around 9:30am, there was no wait and plenty of open tables. The entire menu is served from open to close so you can get whatever you want: sweet, savory, light, hearty, or just one of their divine selections of coffees, lattes, lemonades, etc. The ambiance is calm and comfortable, and the food is beyond amazing in flavor, overall quality, and presentation. The establishment is set in a plaza with plenty of parking. Step off the strip because Vegas has so much more to offer! Seriously, check this place out!!!  Bonus: This place is on the way to Red Rock Canyon so it's super convenient for visitors.",

I had ordered the Corned Beef Smash, after a recommendation from the cashier, and French Toast and my date got the Bacon Old School and Acai Bowl. The food was amazing, we devoured every bite. The corned beef had amazing texture and flavors and the potatoes were well seasoned. The French toast was amazing flavors also, nice hint of cinnamon and texture was great. While the old school was very plain with just eggs, bacon, potatoes, and side salad, it was well balance. The highlight was definitely the acai bowl which had the right amount of everything in every bite. If I had one criticism is that it is a little pricey; our orders came to a total of $50+ and while the taste and flavors were there, brunch seemed too overpriced.",

After waiting in line for around 5 minutes I put in my order, paid, and joined my gal pals at a central table. I liked the simple decor, the potted plants, and the dark tables. I feared we were going to have a long wait until the food was brought out, but I was pleasantly surprised when everything came out all together in just a few short minutes.  There was a ton of staff members who you could tell all worked like a well oiled machine.  My food was light, colorful, and tasty. I left very full and satisfied.  Parking was a bit tight-luckily there was a dirt lot for overflow. And the acustics were crazy in there. I could hardly hear the conversation at my table.",

There are lots of seats and you order at the counter here. I opted for the Shakshuka which are eggs baked in a rich tomato sauce and a cinnamon roll because, well, do you know me? I can never turn down a cinnamon roll. My gal pal opted for the French toast and we added a side of bacon because, bacon!     Everything was delicious and the staff is walking around to help you if you need anything while you're seated.

We ordered quite a few dishes, all was delicious! Corn beef hash was super tender with the sunny side egg, french toast was light and fluffy, it was not overly sweet which is a plus, shakshuka had lots of flavor but need more toast to dip in that red sauce! Salmon toast was light and crispy, I didn't try the beet salad but my brother seem to enjoy it a lot. Would definitely come again to try something else on the menu!",

You fall in line, order up and they bring your order to the table as you seat yourself.  The wait staff was friendly and the kitchen gets your order to the table quickly.  Very efficient process.  However, any assistance after you get your food requires you having to come up to the front cashier area.  You get your own dining setup, refill your own water, get you own condiments, etc. as a dedicated server is not assigned to your table.  I'm cool with this but just an FYI.  Also, it's  first come first serve when it comes to seating. Think of a sweet tomatoes service setup without the all you can eat option.  Neighbors cuisine:  The breakfast sandwich was small in size but big in flavor.  The salad sided with it was very fresh and tasty.  It could definitely stand alone if need be.  My latte was tasty and comes adorned with a flower graphic on the top.  The BBF's avocado toast looked tasty but came on one medium piece of bread, great presentation though.  The old school had heartier servings and my friend took it down quickly because it was flavorful.  Neighbors ambiance:  Potted plants adorn the this boutique cafe and the plant wall in the back is very cool. White walls and ceilings with a minimalist styling makes a for a visually pleasant dining area.  However, the acoustics of the area make it very noisy.  To the point where you definitely have to raise your voice for conversation if it open dining area starts getting busy.    There isn't dedicated table service and it's very noisy but the staff is great and the food is tasty. There are more dishes on the menu I'd definitely like to sample next time I'm in the area, but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy!",

There was a point in time that I think I went every weekend.   Salmon toast- I liked it better than the avocado toast. The smoked salmon was delish and the bread didn't get soggy.    Avocado toast- flavorful but I could easily make it at home is how I saw it   French toast- probably one of my go tos as I love the honey butter and the granola. Can I just eat those two things together if it didn't clog up my arteries? Lol. The bread isn't soggy and it had the right amount of egg wash.   Breakfast burrito- hearty but a good ratio of sausage and eggs to potatoes. I would def recommend putting some hot sauce on it too.   The one thing that surprised me was the portobello burger. Hearty and lots of fries if you love fries. The bread was a little much for me but I try to eat less carbs sometimes.   Overall, food is great and service is good. It can get backed up when it's busy but it's worth the wait or the postmates if that's how you want to roll.",

I've been here a few times now & every experience has been exceptional.  Their food is fantastic.  Well-prepared, well-seasoned high-quality ingredients & their coffee and beverage menu goes beyond your standard lattes and cold brews.  The ambiance is light, clean and minimal.  The only indulgence to the decor is the generously spread potted plants, making you feel more like you're on a rooftop terrace than in a nondescript parking lot in Las Vegas.  In a desert city of excess that lacks cool, casual refinement, Neighbors is an oasis.",

We decided on the breakfast burrito & sandwich with vanilla lattes. We paid & got our table name sign and found a table.   While we waited, I noticed the restaurant is so bright, open & clean. I absolutely love all of the plants & succulents everywhere!   Even though it is a self service establishment, the \"servers\" brought our drinks, food & checked on us multiple times to see how we liked the food, drinks and came by again after we were done to clear away the plates & cups.

    "text": "Just had to see what this new spot was all about. After this first visit, I knew I'll be coming back again.   Neighbors is literally a \"neighborhood\" spot tucked into the Southwest of Vegas. Careful not to drive past it because of its sort-of discreet driveway. Get here early! - We came in on Saturday morning around 10:30 and it was packed!   Tip: because of its self-seating dining area, have someone in your group first grab a table before they're all taken.  When you walk in, you'll find a line formed in front of the cashier who takes your order and hands you the number & stand to place on your table - only instead of a number it's your handwritten name.   On this sunny August morning, there was a Summer Menu, so not only was I ordering from it today, it also made me wonder if there's a Fall menu,... or Winter, or Spring.   I went with the Protein Bowl ($8) which includes quinoa, eggplant, mushrooms, and your choice of tofu (+$2), chicken (+$3), steak (+$5), or my choice, grilled salmon (+$6). With the salmon option you even have the choice of how you want it cooked; I would've gone for the well-done but I wanted to try the medium and it did not disappoint! The portion was also very generous. I mixed up everything together and didn't waste a bite!  I only wish that I lived closer. I want to try everything on the summer menu so that I can make my way to the regular one.",

They literally drop a bunch of lavender or mint in your lemonade and that it, so you don't even taste it, all for $4?!! It's not even an efficient use of their time! We witnessed people getting one drink at a time from the servers, then burgers coming out before pancakes, at the same table!! No efficiency here whatsoever. My husband got a chicken sandwich and I got the sweet beets salad, to go...took 45 minutes!! Definitely not worth the wait. Like another review stated, it's like going to a friend's house and they made you lunch, whoopee Dee! I'd rather go to Vic Vegas's place for a sandwich where it's good and does not take this long! Never coming back. My time is more valuable.",

The cashier made a very poor suggestion of the Shakushka minus the eggs, cheese and bread.. which leaves basically just tomato sauce and garnish. Tasty tomato sauce, but not much else. I went back up and ordered potato's to bulk it up, but it ended up being just rather pricy sauce. My partner's mushroom burger was tasty but on the soggy side.   If you are omni or just vegetarian, you'll definitely enjoy this place. If I go back I'll stick to coffee and a side of fruit, thanks.",

I got over the order at the counter process with handheld menus.  I tried the frittata with chorizo. Not my favorite but my fiance loved his burrito especially the sauce.  The second time we got burritos to go as I don't love the atmosphere. It's clean but loud, serve yourself anyway.  I thought I loved the burrito but found the sauce over powering. The third and fourth times the burritos were greasy. I've decided the cost is not reasonable, and I apparently don't love the flavor combinations.  It's on our list but we don't go often.",

Super noisy here, it's difficult to hold a conversation without pausing to wonder if the person you're talking to can hear you, because you can't even hear yourself.  I ordered ... to try and it tasted great! Until a few minutes in.. my egg was burnt on the bottom and the top layer was getting over cooked and not tasting as pleasant anymore.  Would not suggest getting this if you don't like overcooked/burnt eggs.  My friend ordered, and hers was a bit flavorless, but her cast iron wasn't as hot as mine and didn't have overcooked/burnt eggs. Interior is bright, simple and a lovely place to enjoy a meal if it weren't for the noise problem.  I've been to places where it's busy, but the noise doesn't echo and amplify. I would love to come back and give their other items a try. Who doesn't love breakfast right? I just wouldn't think I'd come out of my way for this place, unless a friend wanted to go",

Neighbors is a casual brunch/ lunch place with a very modern and chill vibe. You order your food at the front and seat yourself which would be my prime complaint- I definitely don't think this would be an effective practice especially if it's super busy, people may be discouraged at the fact that there are no tables nor specific waiting area.   We ordered the avocado toast and the old school. The avocado toast was very light and refreshing but definitely not filling as it only comes with one slice and a small side salad. The old school was your typical breakfast plate with bacon, eggs, potatoes, and your choice of toast. Overall, both were good- nothing exceptionally notable, but still good.     We ordered 2 coffees- an iced caramel latte and a regular drip. The regular coffee was very acidic and hard to drink even with an excess amount of half and half. The iced latte didn't have much of a coffee taste- I'd compare it to milk.   Overall, I'd return. The menu had a number of items that sounded delicious, the dining area was very aesthetic, food was good, and the service was great.",

We walked in and directly sat down thinking that they would take our order. But you actually order then they deliver your food. The service was kinda moderate. One server asked if we ordered our food, but didn't tell us we walk up to order.   Besides that, I asked about the kale salad and the vegetarian burger. The server suggested both were good, but vegetarian mushroom burger didn't come with a veggie patty.   So I went with the kale salad. It was good, but could of added more veggies since the plate to filling ratio wasn't enough.   Overall, cute place, but needs to work more on customer service and making sure everything is good. No one checked up on us after they delivered the orders. So everything is kind of self serve.",

    "text": "Stopped this morning with my girls.. first impression walking in the door was outstanding! Everyone was smiling and made direct eye contact. The place is well lit with lots of green plants spread around. A little art on the walls could really make it pop, but let's get right to the food.. Menu looked very unique, a mix of classic breakfast items with a few twists.. we ordered the chicken and waffles, breakfast burrito, breakfast sandwich on sourdough, and the French toast. Arriving at the table all portions were large in size and tabled to considerably please the eye.  French toast was out of this world. I'm not even a sweet breakfast food person and it blew my mind. I loved the subtle crunch of the added oats.  Breakfast sandwich and burrito were phenomenally executed.  The burrito was packed with hearty meat, potatoes, and a spicy mayo alongside, while the greens on the sandwich gave a very healthy crisp I wasn't expecting from a breakfast sandwich.   The chicken and waffles could have used a little work, as the waffles didn't really shine, but the breading on the chicken was amazing! I'd suggest a  chicken portion(s) with more meat? It came with two wing portions which made it feel a little weak.   Overall we loved it!!!! Friendly staff, bright open atmosphere, clean look, AND less than a block from my house?!?!  Great job guys!! I'll be back soon indeed.",

I ordered the steak and eggs and was shocked at how flavorful and delicious the steak was. Everything was cooked perfectly, the service was wonderful, and the price was right. I've seen a review or two on here that are complaining about the price and I don't understand it. The prices are barely higher than Denny's or Village Inn and the quality is about 10 times better than either of those places. This is going to become a regular spot for me.",

Their coffee was great and food was good, but was not happy to pick 6 small hairs out of our two plates of food.

Depending on what you value most or what your preferences are, Neighbors will fancy you differently.  The music, the ambiance, real plants, open space, large windows for sunlight, the fancy and small centerpiece plants, plates and silverware, the cool chalk board name plates for your orders are all pretty welcoming and neat.  I really enjoy a sunny and home feel to restaurants.  Especially these new and niche places that seem like home.  The funny thing is lots of the younger crowds don't have nice homes, or cook, or anything, so that's why nowadays a lot of these business just look and cook meals that represent something your family cooks.  The food comes out pretty and nice.  For younger people in the teenager to late 30s, you won't be bothered and will be satisfied with every aspect of this business.  Anyone who cooks or shops often or has a high standard of service, you'll constantly be asking yourself, or the staff questions here and there about, \"where's my order again?\" or, \"I didn't ask for that.  Can ya remake it?\"    I personally dislike wasting food for them to throw it away cuz of a mistake.  Yet it happened a few times in one visit and other visits.  Its cool cuz they compensate the wait or the honest mistake with more food.    For those who seek vegetarian options, this place is very friendly.  They still have steak and eggs for the others.  For vegans there are few, very few options.  Whenever you ask to make em that way they say they can't.  You watch them make it from scratch and wonder why they can't.  Sometimes when they do, they'll still botch or forget.  I don't wanna ramble on but the verdict is, I had mixed feelings on my visits here.  If you're here to chat to a friend it's perfect.  Semi health concerns, wanna eat steak and eggs but wanna make it kinda healthy?  Sure, it's great.  Vegetarians that want to have a quick meal?  Yeah it's dope.  Vegans, people who want the best in the food and the price and service, will be whatever about it.  You'd go here if someone wants to, but you, yourself, will never recommend or decide to come here on your own.  I'd say try it once and give it a shot, because many people who review or come here will strongly disagree with me.",

The positives- really cute atmosphere and decor, food was good enough. I had avo toast and coffee. The poached egg was very underdone, toast was nice and avocado was perfectly ripe, the side of lettuce was strange though, just a sprinkle of pumpkin seeds; I wasn't sure what to do with it, put it on my toast too?  Coffee was too strong and the complementary water tasted like tap.  For nearly $15 I could have made all 4 of my family members the same EXACT breakfast and better coffee.  If you don't cook and don't care what you spend, this place is ok.",

We both ordered the \"Old School\" two eggs, bacon, toast, smashed potatoes and with greens I substituted the potatoes for fruit which was melon and cantaloupe which were perfectly ripe. The toast was a super hearty whole grain. Not your normal Wonder bread wheat. My BF, who knows me so well, gave me one of his smashed potatoes. It was perfect!  Crunchy on the outside and fluffy in the center with just the right amount of salt.   I love the bright decor- white tile and concrete floors.  It is very lively AKA loud. Would not recommend for anyone who has difficulty hearing.  We took a couple of peanut butter cookies to go. They offered to heat them but we are saving them for our Sunday exploring. The burgers looked good.  Will be back to try other items.",

The first time I came, I walked in a waited a few seconds to realize that you order at the counter. I walk up and one of the girls looks at me and says \"what do you want?\", I was astonished on how rudely mannered she was.  I let her know I have never been here before and if she could guide me on how things worked. She just pointed at the counter and said \"order here\" and walked away.  I knew I should've left but I always try and give any place a chance, I ordered my food, I got a breakfast burrito; which the burrito was amazing and had so much flavor.  Overall first time experience, the service was bad but the food was good.   My second visit, I decided to order to-go through grub hub because I wanted to grab something before work.  I order online and go in about 15 minutes after I order. Both my boyfriend and I wait to get someone's attention, and my boyfriend tells them he has a pick up.   The guy who gave him the to go order just handed it to my boyfriend and said \"thanks you, bye\". My boyfriend wanted to order a drink but the young man did not even act like he cared. He waited by the counter, got his drink and we left.   Honestly the food here is fantastic, but the service is what makes us stray away. I would rather order to go then to sit in that place and be treated like that every time. Maybe I'll give them another chance, but not any time soon.",

It's very modern and simplistic with a lot of little plants :-) Got to sit at a table by the wall of plants, which also might be the best place to sit. Lighting is also BOMB. Your photos will look very aesthetic.  I'm not a fan of burritos and it's definitely not my first choice, but the breakfast burrito sounded good and the pictures on their Yelp page made it look good. Ended up trying it and loved it! I put some Tapatio sauce on the burrito, which made it even better. It's a huge burrito and I had to take the other half home. I also tried their iced matcha latte. This is probably my new favorite matcha latte that I've had. I've been to places where I could barely taste the matcha green tea and it would be just mostly milk, but it was a good balance of matcha to milk.  Definitely will be here more often and will probably try a burger next.  ***************************  Update: Tried the bacon burger. Favorite bacon cheeseburger, ever. I also got it with sweet potato fries. Get it with sweet potato fries, you won't regret it.",

You come in order your food sit down and the food will come to you. Something they do in New York is community tables and neighbors offers that. If you aren't used to it, it can be weird but it's fun once you've done it a few times. I got the French toast and it was a lot of food it was good though. I also got a smoothie and that was delicious as well. The staff is great.",

When You walk in, not only are you greeted by the refreshing view of many lush green plants, but also the warm friendly smiles of the staff!  The front cashier was upbeat and fabulous.   The food!!!  Soooooooo amazing and fresh!!  They paid close attention to our special requests and the food was nice and hot.  The potatoes in the breakfast burrito tasted just like my grandma used to make!  The sweet potato fries were perfect, especially paired with the chipotle mayo!!  If I could give 10 stars, i would!!!    ----  Back again for another yummy meal!! We appreciate how consistently good the food is here!",

I got the breakfast sandwich and my boyfriend got the mushroom burger. I got the side salad with my sandwich and he had the fries. I loved the food!  Both were great but the breakfast sandwich in my opinion was my favorite. It's a huge portion for only 8 bucks!  Thee chipotle mayo on it complemented the egg, sausage and bacon. The salad was light and went perfectly well with the heavier sandwich.   The mushroom burger was also super juicy and flavorful and the fries were super thin and crispy.. exactly the way I like it.   Will definitely be back to try more of the menu.  It's currently my favorite brunch spot in Vegas!",

    "text": "Food and beverages are usually pretty good.  Customer service in person is usually pretty good.  This review is because of the oddly rude customer service over the phone.  I had gone in about a week ago and was told they had stopped serving their summer menu about a week prior.  Which was a bummer because there were a couple items I had wanted to try, but that's fine.  So today, I go to their website to see their fall menu.  Nothing.  They only have their summer menu, which is confusing, because they had stopped their summer menu in-store a few weeks ago.  So I call them, and ask if they are still serving their summer menu, and I am told they are not.  I ask them if they have their fall menu in-store, and am told they do.  I let them know that their website does not have their fall menu, and that it erroneously has their summer menu.  At this point, a bit of annoyance creeps into the person's voice and she says that they can't change the website because the owner isn't in and they have been busy.  Which makes no sense, because that means for at least 2+ weeks, they have been too busy to update their website?  I ask how I can see their fall menu, and am told it is on their Instagram profile.  I thank her, and we hang up the phone.  I do a Google search for \"Instagram Neighbors Las Vegas\" and click on the first link, which shows a bunch of pictures that don't have a menu anywhere.  So I call back, get the same person, and ask her how to get to the menu.  She says I have to go to the Instagram page.  I explain how it is not showing up when I search for it.  She says she doesn't know their username and gets her phone out to find it.  Throughout, she sounds annoyed.  She tells me what their username is, and I go to their page, and it says at the top that the fall menu is coming soon.  I tell her that their profile says the fall menu is coming soon, and she says that they haven't had a chance to update that.  Which makes no sense, because according to her, the menu is on their page, so she's telling me that they've had a chance to update their profile with the menu but not the part that says the fall menu isn't here yet?  She says the menu is available as a story, but that means I have to log in or create an account, just to view their menu.  Here's what I don't get.  Why is an employee annoyed with me when all I want to do is look at the menu?  How is it my fault that they have a website that has their summer menu, but no fall menu, even though in-store, they only have the fall menu?  How is it my fault that a Google search for their Instagram page doesn't come up with their Instagram page?  How is it my fault their Instagram page says their fall menu is coming soon when apparently it's actually available, but only if you have an Instagram account and are logged into it?",

It was slightly sweetened to not over power the matcha flavor and that's what I want when I order one.  I'm a sucker for anything lemon. Seeing that their coconut pancakes had a berry lemon syrup it was a must order for me. This entire dish tasted so fresh, which sounds crazy to say about pancakes, but they were light and fluffy & the berry lemon syrup, packed with blueberries, had me wanting to lick the plate clean.   Do I think they are bit overpriced for their concept (order at a counter & the food is brought to you)? Yes But, did they leave a solid first impression for me to want to return? YES",

The Matcha wasn't overly sweet and they were able to substitute almond or soy milk instead of regular. Yay!

    "text": "Hubby had been to Neighbors before but I wanted to experience the establishment and formulate my own opinion.  We got there around 11:15 and I was told to choose from the menu sitting on the counter and then order from the cashier.  The food would be delivered to our table.  I ordered the French toast with an iced coffee.  Husband ordered the Steak and Egg combo, a bowl of corn chowder and a strawberry lemonade.   When I heard the cashier state the price ($44.38), I was sticker shocked.  Husband paid for our meal and we sat at a table with our place card displayed.  My French toast arrived but I was a little disappointed.  Not in the actual (3) large and thick golden French toast slices, but seeing the large chunk of almost 2\" of pure butter on top of the top piece and the disappointing lack of strawberries that was advertised.  The menu said the French toast came with \"strawberries\".  I saw (5) thinly cut strawberry slices that if you were to glue them back together, you'd have one whole strawberry.  This was almost a joke to me that was not funny.  There was a small sprinkling of the homemade granola over the top of the French toast slices and around the plate, the granola tasted good.  Overall, my French toast tasted good and I was not disappointed in the quality, I just wished I had several more strawberries and more granola.  Hubby's steak and eggs and then his corn chowder was reviewed in his Yelp review.  I will just add today's picture in my review.   What I really didn't care for at this restaurant was the lack of staff/customer interaction.  I had never been here and I didn't know that I had to basically fend for myself.  I felt that self service was kind of \"fast food'ish\" and it didn't seem to match the upscale and modern/hip vibe I was feeling from this place.  I had to keep getting up from my table to get assorted items from the self serve counter.  Silverware.  Salt/pepper.  Ketchup.  Napkins.  To-go box.  Definitely a \"no frills\" type of service...a little different set of rules of customer service then what I was expecting.  The interior of this establishment was a little open and noisy for my taste, I was having a hard time hearing fully what my husband was saying.  The openness and concrete floors, combined with the lack of sound absorbing decor/walls didn't provide me with a comfort that I think of when I hear \"neighbors\".  I'm not sure I would be returning to Neighbors, as I feel the overall experience did not match the price we paid today.",

Despite the business, I noticed that the workers are hard working and fast. After the group next to us left, a worker cleaned their table up only moments after.  I got the avo toast, which was perfect for my light appetite. I don't think it will satisfy those with a huge appetite, as it's only 1 slice with a light salad on the side. Tasty though! I also got an iced queen bee latte, which had the right amount sweetness, subtle but good.

I've been here a couple times and here's what I've ordered Corned Beef Smash, Shakshuka, Steak and Eggs, and the Blu-J smoothie. Honestly all of the food is amazing. I don't have a single bad thing to say about this place.  Food is fantastic. Their drinks are exceptional. Just come here once and you'll see.",

First you order at the table then sit with your table marker for food to be delivered.  The overall setup was good, but I feel it took away from normal service. Because it was busy and you sit yourself, your responsible for your own water and drink refills. There's no problem with this, it's just a bit of a pain when busy.  In terms of the food, it was good overall. Great flavor in both meals. Nothing extraordinary but very good. I got the BLATC sandwich which was fresh, with yummy aioli and crispy bacon. My husband old school was good per his review.   Overall I'd recommend this place to friends and family, I just wish we got served. Serving would make it a little more low key and relaxing, so we could eat our meal.",

The restaurant is located on the Southwest part of town, off the 215 & Russell in an area that looks like it would not be zoned for restaurants.   When we walked in, it looked like a chic brunch spot in Cali. You place your order at the counter, then they bring your food to your table. We ordered the following items:  Portoritto: B- (My husband was expecting more portobello mushrooms)  Breakfast burrito: B (Potatoes are in the burrito, so I didn't really need a side of smashed red potatoes. Wish there was more pico de Gallo)  Pancakes: A- (You get 4 heavenly pancakes)  Red smashed potatoes: C (Could have used more seasoning or maybe peppers?!)  Hot Chocolate with almond milk: B  Overall, I'd really give them 3.5 stars out of 5.",

I had the steak and eggs and while the meat was tender and undercooked, it was full of fat and gristle.  Not very enjoyable.  My wife had two eggs and toast. The bill was $29 That's quite a bit for what we had and the lack of quality.  There are much closer and far better venues for much less cost here in northern Summerlin.  Don't think we'll return.",

    "text": "I'm going to be completely honest. I have seen their sign for a while. I drive past them nearly every single day, as I live super close to this establishment. However, the building I see which is facing the street, has blacked out Windows. I have always thought that building WAS this business. It appeared as if there WAS NO BUSINESS. It wasn't until I searched Yelp for restaurants near me, that I saw Neighbors. So jumped in there to look at the Date of the last review. 3 days ago!! So the business is opened after all?? So my husband and I finally went!   Expectations: Restaurant where you get seated by a hostess and are waited on.  Reality: This is a fast-casual, hipster with Minimalism decor, establishment where you seat yourself and order your food at the counter. Everything is at the counter: silverware, napkins, drip coffee, creamer, salt & pepper, etc. , and the menus.  The decor was very nice. It was pretty loud in there. If you grabbed a table first before ordering, you felt the pressure of trying to decide what to eat as you watch the line grow longer and longer. Then, you have to leave you stuff at the table (or something to stake your claim) so that your table doesn't get nabbed.   The food was high quality and the presentation was beautiful! Plus, it tasted good too! But it felt a little chaotic, but that is ONLY because I expected being seated and staying seated. I had to keep getting up to order, grab silverware, grab napkins, grab my coffee, etc. That's not bad in itself. I just had different expectations for my first time.  I DO recommend this place! And I will be back! I'll post photos shortly.",

The first time me & a friend visited, the place just opened and the food that we were served was pretty good, but now after awhile, on my second visit recently, I would say the food has stepped up a whole lot. I ordered the steak and eggs with chimichuri sauce and it was perfect. Steak was cooked perfectly and of course the eggs were cooked accordingly. Came with a bread and the lemon muffin was perfectly baked. It was Saturday morning and it was pretty busy.  Although the food was superb, my one star less is from the customer service I received today. I came to have breakfast with my two year old son and after I ordered, we sat by the window and my son sat on the pillow side, when the old lady server gave us our Lemon muffin and iced matcha, I kindly asked her if she can get us a glass of water because I don't want to leave my son alone in the chair, without hearing me completely, she immediately told me YOU CAN SERVE YOURSELF WITH WATER OVER THERE. I thought that was very rude especially after I mentioned to her I did not want to leave my son alone (2 year old) in the chair. I know it's a self serve that's why I asked nicely but she didn't bother to understand. Hope this help the owner or the manager to let the employees know that sometime there are circumstances that you should listen to the customer.   Hope that will change because we really support this place as",

    "text": "Neighbors is just OK. I feel like there aren't many cool hipster local places like this (hence all the great reviews) and the area is desperately craving something like this, but this place still just falls a little flat.  I've been in here at least 4 times and the service is really disappointing. Their cheeseburgers are not served with mayo and getting a side of mayo, or ranch is $1 each-- which tbh is kind of offensive. If you're going to pay for an expensive burger shouldn't the condiments be free?   The last time I came into Neighbors, I ordered a burger and when it arrived I had forgotten you had to buy the mayo-- so I went to the counter, paid the $1 for the mayo and waited. The short-haired woman told me they would bring it over and then proceeded to chat away with her co-worker pals. So I went to my seat and waited for well over 5 minutes (no mayo) while my burger got cold-- finally I went back up to the register and the woman said \"Yes\"? In a kind of snarky way and I said I'm still waiting on my mayo. She said \" well it'll be out soon.\" To which I replied \"I'd prefer to have it while my burger is still warm.\" She legit rolled her eyes at me and huffed that she had to be bothered to get the side of mayo herself. It's such a dumb, unnecessary interaction that sours the whole dining experience. When you're spending $40 on a lunch for 2, asking for friendly service really isn't too much to ask. (I felt annoyed and swindled that I actually tipped this woman 20% on my meal-- especially when it's not a \"traditional\" waitress position)  The cheeseburger (even with the mayo) is just a big meh; just another dry mediocre burger.  What IS good is their beet salad-- wholly moly is it dynamite! The beet salad with chicken never disappoints.  Pros: The beet salad- AMAZING          The ambiance is super cool           Cons: The wait-staff is rude            The prices are high            Condiments like ranch and mayo cost extra            They don't accept apple pay",

I am really happy did because just might have found my new coffee spot!! It not only the lattes but the food and the fresh baked goodies are all delicious. The ones I had on two different occasions were very much on point!   My first visit came in for nice recovery lunch. I went with nice hearty filling sandwich. I ended up ordering the Chipotle Chicken Sandwich and also got blueberry muffin. It was amazing. Every component tasted fresh from the chicken, the fresh greens, onion, and few more items. The chipotle spread that took it up from not just plain jain sandwich but legit fresh sandwich. It nice size sandwich. Filling!!! The fries were nothing special but still they were nice and hot well seasoned. Definitely menu item would order again.  The blueberry muffin was tasty. One section off to the left of the counter has there fresh baked pastries. I like simple not huge selection. Each one on individual almost pastries stands or plate. Each one label so know without asking. The cinnamon rolls. I wanted to get one of those too. Just be overboard for just me. Lol. I ended up going with the blueberry muffin. The girl at counter got me sold even more telling me make pastries fresh everyday! It between small muffin and over the took big ones. I ended up eating it later that day. It was still one of the best muffins had in Vegas.  My second visit went with Matcha Latter and another blueberry muffin. It was the perfect compliment with my latte. Blueberry muffin was exactly the same feeling the first time. Really good blueberry muffin.   One thing should know is no table service you go up to the counter order, different they write your name rather then number that u take to a table, all the condiments and tap water you grab at the counter, and then someone drops food off at the table. I love the interior vibe all around. I all really nice wood table some long community tables. It would make sense with Neighbors and more open community of diners. I never been there full on packed. I could see it being loud cause all the table packed together. I love all the plants all round the restaurant. The service was five stars from everyone interacted with both times.   If looking for great breakfast/lunch spot off the strip Neighbors is winnah. I look forward to trying more of the menu.",

Coming in, I wasn't expecting the restaurant to be in such a isolated commercialized area with a very interesting parking set up that led into the dirt for overflow parking. The line was quite long and the space was surprisingly huge! The ambiance is great and I can see why photos are all over everyone's Instagram. The main area to the right of the register was loud and bustling, but the other side was quite and calm, which is where we ended up sitting. I enjoy that Neighbors tries to be sustainable with their glass water cups and silverware.   I ordered the shakshuka and lavender latte with almond milk and my sister had the chicken chipotle sandwich with a raspberry lemonade. The shakshuka was good and flavorful with chilis that had some kick, but it is not something I would order again. The lavender latte was alright, nothing special. My sister was unimpressed with her food as well and we both found the menu to be overpriced in comparison to what we got.",

I wasn't really feeling coffee that day but the lavender lemonade I ordered seemed like a great substitute. I liked how little lavender buds could be seen floating at the top of the drink.   The service is friendly and very quick. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. There was plenty of seating and each table seemed to have an aesthetic element on or around it.   We ordered the Shakshuka and Old School. Both were reasonably priced at $10 each and were very large portion sizes. The Shakshuka wasn't as spicy as I had thought but it did have some seeds that I had to skim for and take out. I chose to pair it with sourdough toast and it seemed like a match made in heaven. The eggs were poached well added more to the tomato flavor. The Old School had tons of potatoes stacked on top of the eggs and salad. The sausage wasn't too salty and had lots of flavor as well. It was an overall very filling breakfast with fresh ingredients paired with a nice ambiance. There's lots of parking too!",

    "text": "Neighbors is a quaint little fast casual restaurant where you order at the counter, grab your utensils and condiments, pick your seat, and employees bring you your food and drink. The decor is simple and the seats are hard wood without any padding. (Not the most comfortable for chillaxing)   The food and drinks are all pretty good. I love to order the frittata with feta instead of mozzarella so it's lighter and not so heavy. The red smashed potatoes are great, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The shakshuka is good if that's your thing (a little too tomato saucey for my taste). The avocado toast is decent, but not a lot of flavor. And the mocha latte is delicious especially since it isn't overly sweet like a lot of chocolate coffee drinks.   The service is mostly good although they do seem to have a constant turnover of their cashiers. My reason for not giving this place 5 stars is the restaurant cleanliness. It's very dusty and it's apparent the employees never clean or detail the condiment station. The amount of dirt and grime on just the salt and pepper shakers alone is horrific. It's sure to get a few dry heaves out of me when I think, \"I wonder how dirty the kitchen where they prepare our food must be?\"  I sure hope not because the food is good!    :-/",

Which was disappointing because my sister got the steak and eggs and we also got the coconut pancake to share. Both other dishes were bomb and full of flavors, dunno why my veggie frittata came out tasting like PAM - no exaggeration. Idk if the business had the chefs forgetting something but I wouldnt order this again if I came back - would come back doe",

Frittatas are large even though they're on the \"light\" menu. Delicious breakfast burritos! Will make an effort to visit here whenever I'm free for brunch",

The flavor is amazing!!!! Thank you neighbors!  Sorry no photos........ we scarfed down our food.   I will add that the staff could smile a little more and be more friendly. Not overly friendly or over the top fake nice but just a little more welcoming.",

All the staff was super attentive even though you have to walk up and order they still do a great job at making sure every one is doing well. The staff was really welcoming and friendly. Everything was great BUT the chai tea latte which tasted more like steamed milk rather than chai tea at all and also had about 2 1/2 inches of foam. Other than the latte which was -1/10, every thing was great! 10/10. I would recommend this to any and everyone in this neighborhood.",

You fill up your own water and grab your own condiments.  They really need to decide whether or not they are a casual or a \"sit down\" place. The mixed signals were overwhelming.  Good luck flagging down a waiter if you have questions or need something . I had to physically GET up after 5 minutes of trying to get one of the waiters attention.  Food is a 3/5. I had to send my streak back because it was SO rare when I had asked for medium.  Cappuccino was really good.  Overall, food was okay but I don't think I would return due to the service.

This dish should have vegetables cooked in the sauce with spices like cumin, paprika salt and pepper. The steak and eggs tasted bland even though they put a chimichuri sauce in top. Please season your food then you will get return client not just customers. I have more things to say but this has gone on long enough.",

Lol It's always fun trying out a cute new brunch place in town, decorated with such a modern type feel with a whole wall of plants, white walls, and bistro bulb lighting to make the eating experience Instagram-worthy.   What keeps me coming back is the fact that their coffee is from Vesta Coffee Roasters, one of my favorite coffee shops in downtown! I'm obsessed with their white mocha latte and their lavender latte which are definite must tries!   Their food is delicious and comes in pretty big portions. I typically get \"The Fun Guy\" which is a meatless burger but is just as yummy filled with a grilled portobello mushroom, a fried eggplant Parmesan, arugula and balsamic aioli! The French toast is also a great choice for something more sweet than savory and will leave you feeling stuffed!  I do wish they had more variety of foods; it's pretty much just sandwiches, salads, and burgers so the menu is limited. They also only have one vegan option which is the avocado toast without the egg - a heads up to fellow vegan friends. Prices are somewhat fair due to the size that you're getting but do expect to spend at least $12+ on just one item.   It's an order at the cashier and seat yourself type place, making it a great choice to have a lunch with friends or a quick coffee pick me up. Service is great and definitely would recommend for your next brunch spot!",

The place is ran as if they've been a seasoned business for years. The staff are always professional and friendly. The ambiance is casual, but interior decor is super hipster with neat plants everywhere. Very open, bright, and spacious.  The food is nothing short of amazing! I hate hate hate mushrooms but their mushroom burger is to die for. All of the lattes I have tried so far have yet to disappoint. And the salmon toast is one of my favorite things on the menu. Although I would recommend trying anything on the menu.  If I could give this place 6 stars, I would.",

The inside looks like Joanna and Chip Gaines decorated; it is absolutely cute and inviting. You order your food and beverages at the register and they will deliver it to your table.   I had the breakfast burrito bowl and a white raspberry mocha. My friend ordered the breakfast sandwich with a salad, and Nutella latte. There is a seasonal menu as well as regular menu, and honestly all the food sounded amazing.   There is a pastry case that has a variety of really delicious looking items. The cinnamon rolls were very tempting, but I ended up not purchasing. We came early (8:30am) and it was not very busy, but it definitely picked up around 9:30-10am just before we left. This was a good place to have a tasty meal, yummy coffee, and converse without yelling. Next time I'll bring my family too. I recommend checking this place out!",

It's pretty much with avocado toast with an egg on top, with a side salad. Something simple! I also ordered a fruit bowl- it cost $3. Not too bad. I think the best thing that I got was the lavender coffee. The lavender was subtle and not too overwhelming! It was slightly fragrant, but!!! The overall taste was amazing. I don't know about you but I love milky coffee.  Milky Not too sweet Sweet To sum it all up, this place sets a nice tone, the ambiance is great, the food is mediocre, their coffee is delicious, and your photos is this place will look stunning!",

    "text": "Today we enjoyed brunch with \"Neighbors\" ;-). The restaurant is literally set up like a cafeteria where you can share a meal and get to know your neighbors.   When you enter you are greeted and handed a menu to begin looking over. The line wraps right next to some delicious looking desserts and cookies. Once you order they give you a little metal tag to put on your table with your name. Very personable touch.   The wife chose the Shakshuka which is served in a skillet and comes with farm fresh eggs, sunny side up so you can break the yolk, tomato, bell peppers, feta cheese and fresno chilies. On the side of the plate you get 4 pieces of thinly sliced toast. Delicious meal and fun to scoop onto the bread with every bite. I decided on the Breakfast burrito this trip but almost went with the Old School breakfast. Both sounded good. The burrito was stuffed with sausage, smashed potatoes,a blend of cheeses and avocado crema. I had some sriracha mayo on the side which accompanied the burrito well and onions and diced tomatoes were sprinkled atop the plate. Definitely a 5/5 burrito. They give a 10% military discount and water is located next to the register; we made a couple trips to refill. I also ordered a sprite thinking it was a fountain drink but was delivered a can and glass with ice after inquiry a few times with the server. Next time just water or try to lemonade.  The place is new and popp'n, even if there are tons of people it'd be worth the wait. We have found a weekend brunch place to enjoy frequently!",

First of all, it was INSANELY oily/greasy. As if that were not enough, the corned beef was little more than ALL FAT. For the price of this dish, I truly expected more. Lastly, not a single person came by and checked on us the entire duration of our visit - and while I understand they are normally very busy - this visit was very early and there was hardly anyone there. Even on their busiest days, we always had one or two people come by and check on us.  The level of disappointment I have after this trip is literally detouring me from going again. It's really sad, actually, because I truly did love this place. I just can't bring myself to spend such an amount on their food anymore. I almost feel like they've gotten too comfortable and don't care for their patrons anymore. Pity.",

We ordered avo toast and shakshouka, sweet potato fries and fruit bowl for my little one. The side salad that came with the avo toast was nicely dressed! Very flavorful. The supposedly star of the dish (avo toast) wasn't everything. I've had better. The shakshouka was delicious! But I've had better. Wish it came with a few more slices of toast. The sweet potato fries was everything though. My son loved it! I'm definitely willing to come back to try other things on the menu like their drinks perhaps? We'll see.",

Aside from my burger coming medium instead of well done, all the toppings were stuck to one side (3 teeny tiny pickles).  The guy couldn't even spread the toppings evenly.  Burger was not well seasoned either.  The Chipotle mayo was pretty much non-existent and the bacon also under-cooked.  It gets 3 stars for arriving quickly and the decent fries.

The Mushroom burger was very good, especially with the Sweet Potato fries.  Everything was very good!  The atmosphere was energetic and lively.  The room was well lit and open, making the space feel huge.  It wasn't too noisy, but loud enough to know no one could really eavesdrop on your conversation, sort of the way that happens at parties.  The decor is gorgeous and almost ripped exactly from my Minimalist Pinterest Board.    There was plenty of parking as it is in a sort of office plaza, but not yet utilized by other businesses.",

Literal fire because the Shakshuka has way more of a chili kick than I was expecting. With a morning beverage menu fit for the gods, I recommend the matcha latte because my boyfriend was matcha green with envy that I wouldn't let him taste it.   Came here for breakfast with some co-workers and it was relatively busy for a Monday morning so I guess this is the spot to play hookey. You could call it a plant based restaurant since there are pots everywhere but the food is a mixture of millennial favorites such as avocado toast and gram worthy lattez. Cheers to 5 STARZ",

Not to mention - but totally worth mentioning - the place was adorable!   I'm slightly obsessed with lavender lattes rn so would you be surprised to know that is what I got here? You shouldn't be! And...I know I'm a yelper and all, but it was totally my first time having the cutesy design on top! It was marvelous btw.  My friend got some kind of Queen Bee latte. It was cinnamon-y and delightful as well.   I got some blueberry/lemon/coconut pancakes and I SWEAR I could've licked the plate clean because they were so amazing!  I will be back and I cannot WAIT to bring more people!!",

    "text": "We love this place! We used to go weekly. Food is/was always delicious and service was good. Occasionally a dish would come out missing something but runners would correct it right away. They used to have a manager when they first opened who was very attentive but those days are long gone. I'm sure they have a manager now but who knows?   Our last experience on Saturday 9/21 was not as pleasant. We received our drinks but then waited 30 minutes for our food. One of us did receive our food but everybody else had to wait. After 25 minutes waiting we asked how much longer and no apologies, just another 5 minutes they said.   People who came after us had already received their food and we're leaving by the time our orders came out.  Unfortunately one of these dishes was for my kids, who again, had to watch and wait patiently.  By the end of our meal I regretted leaving a tip.  They have now expanded but it seems like they're struggling to keep with the pace of orders.   Tip to Neighbors: Bring a tables orders out at the same time, or kids first. At least apologize when orders are taking so long, or better yet tell people when they are ordering. \"Sorry for the wait but we are serving our orders in 30 minutes.\"  Strive to give the best service, even when busy, and customers will keep coming back!  Tip to customers: If you go on a weekend make sure you have plenty of time and pack snacks ;)",

    "text": "I really thought I would like this place a lot more. Great atmosphere, menu had plenty of interesting options, but overall it was just overpriced and not executed well.  Pros: Comfortable, rustic dining area with counter-ordering, seat yourself and then food service. Very clean and open atmosphere, and some of what we ordered was very tasty.  - sourdough is thick sliced and delicious - sausage is juicy and flavorful - salad is the savior of flavor!  Cons: For what we ordered it was overpriced, poorly executed, and honestly just odd in places.  - We ordered eggs on the side of the breakfast sandwich, and ended up with just a traditional breakfast plate that came to the table at least 5 minutes before anything else we ordered. Neither of us could figure out why the remaining ingredients (bacon, sausage, arugula, cheese, and chipotle mayo) couldn't have been served on a sandwich still. As it was they didn't include the mayo spread and we had to ask for it on the side still. - the avocado toast was just extremely underwhelming, which is odd since it's a simple dish to start with. The poached egg was so overcooked they may as well have just gone with hardboiled. There was so much avocado that the ratio was 1:1 with thick sliced bread, and it had no seasoning so it was overwhelming. I love avocado, but that's just too much without anything to cut through it. I opted to leave off tomatoes, but 3 small, sliced plain tomatoes wouldn't have saved this. What did save it was the side salad that had all the flavor after I scraped off about an entire avocados worth of spread in order to balance out the flavors.  It looked like the restaurant does a lot of coffees so maybe food just isn't really the focus of as go back again in the future.",

    "text": "This is an update to a previous two star review.  My wife had not been to the restaurant and wanted to see if things had changed since I had previously gone or if it was a one time thing.  I ordered the same Steak and Eggs, and this time I ordered the corn chowder to go with it.   I specifically asked for the soup as an appetizer. Not only was it served with my full meal, it was served 10 minutes after my wife got her meal. The corn chowder while flavorful was cold when it got to the table.  When looking at my main entree, I immediately realized that the major issue from my first review had not changed. The eggs were again lying in a pool of grease....more like floating on top of it! I also asked for the meat to be medium rare. It was pretty well done.  Due to the materials used for decorating the restaurant -- concrete, tile, etc, the room is quite loud and almost beyond being able to carry a conversation.   The meal cost $44.00 for Steak & Eggs, my wife's French Toast, corn chowder and two drinks. Too expensive for the meal as served.  This visit confirmed that I won't be returning.",

I wish there was room here for an outdoor patio area that way you could escape the noise.  Next, (not something you'll care about if you don't have young children) but there is no changing table in the restroom. Not good! The menu is a little all over the place and lots of sausage, bacon, cheese... things others love but not us.  My husband got the shakshuka and said it was good but very \"American\" he's Israeli and knows the difference lol! I got a seasonal salad bowl which was good the corn was fried or maybe grilled but it stuck to my teeth (not a good look) but tasted great! We both ordered the lavender mocha and that I must say was really good!",

But quality ingredients can only go so far if you don't know what to do with them.  That being said, my reason for 2 stars was just an overall lack of flavor. I ordered the breakfast burrito bowl style, and while it was good, it was nothing special. From the first bite I immediately started looking for some ketchup and hot sauce. Not to compliment the flavor, but to make up for the complete lack of it. The scrambled eggs were bland, smashed potatoes unseasoned, and the sausage had no smoke to it. My sister ordered the Fun Guy burger, had roasted red and green peppers, portobello mushroom and fried eggplant. She said they basically fried and grilled some veggies and threw them in between 2 buns, no seasoning, no flavor, just bland.   The ambience is bright, fun and vibrant. But the food, while nice to look at, is all aesthetics and no substance. Better off going to Denny's, Egg Works, the Cracked Egg, etc.",

It can accommodate for large groups, they have a pretty large space, roomy and the simplistic plant decor makes for a refreshing atmosphere. I really like the concept if this place because operation-wise it's efficient. They hand you a menu as you walk in, you order, pay, they give you a table number, and you seat yourself. They have a variety of breakfast and lunch entrees fit for savory or sweet. They also have a wide range of coffee, lattes, teas, and drinks. Service is fast and friendly. I also like how they have the to go containers available for you to get yourself. This is a great place to go with family or a friend.   Drink recommendation: Iced Lavendar Latte, you're welcome :)",

    "text": "One of my favorite breakfast places to go to due to the great food, good service and cute atmosphere. I have tried many things on the menu and everything tastes delicious.   My favorite is the BREAKFAST BURRITO with applewood smoked bacon instead of the sausage. What I really enjoy about this burrito is the fact that the potatoes aren't smashed tater tots which make everything mushed they're whole red potatoes which makes the bite more crunchy and yummy. My boyfriend who is a fan of breakfast burritos says it's his favorite out of all the breakfast burritos (lol). It's very filling as well you can take the other half to go or eat it but you'll feel really stuffed.   For drinks, if you want something sweet and not caffeinated the lavender lemonade is to die for! For coffee, I stick to a normal iced latte which is good as well.   Service is always fast and friendly! We don't live too close to this place and we make an effort to come to this spot almost once a week because of how good it is. There is also ample parking! There are also two sides for seating, one is more noisy which is the central area and to the left of the register is a more quiet setting.",

I ordered the matcha tea latte and the breakfast burrito, around $19 for that -the most I've spent per person for brunch. Breakfast burrito was just okay, lots of filling gaps and the sausages they used wasn't good. I only had a few bites before I took it for the car ride home. The matcha latte, however was one of the best matcha drinks I've ever had. Real matcha and it was so distinct. This was pretty much my breakfast.   I also sampled the corned beef and steak. THOSE are the items one should be ordering here. Yum!!!",

    "text": "It was our last morning in Vegas, so some friends and I found Neighbors here on Yelp. Everything we saw looked delicious, so we decided to give it a try! Visitors, this restaurant is about a 20 to 25 minute drive away from the Strip. We just like to explore different areas of Vegas when we visit, so the distance doesn't bother us.   To eat I got the Frittata with Turkey Sausage and an Iced Lavendar London Fog to drink. At first I was a little skeptical on the price of the frittata coming in at $12. In my experience a frittata is so thin. BUT I WAS WRONG. The frittata here was loaded with veggies and eggs. It was about an inch thick. Totally worth it! My London Fog was delicious, but when first served was lukewarm. There wasn't enough ice to cool it down quick enough so I was in that awkward one sip is cold the next sip is warm territory. But, I drank it all!  My two friends each got a burger - the mushroom burger (not the portobello burger) and the bacon and cheese burger, and some of the cookies for dessert. They were both happy with their selections. I would surely recommend this joint to someone look for a wide variety of breakfast and lunch options, especially if you're looking to stay on the healthy side. There's something for everyone!",

Everyone in our party enjoyed their meals, but I thought ours was the best! My husband and I split a frittata. Even though I forgot to ask for added meat, the huge portion was yummy and was plenty of food for us to split and go away satisfied. My sugar free caramel latte was creamy and delicious. Everyone was very friendly and they were fine with us staying and visiting with our daughter while we sipped coffee for awhile after finishing our breakfast.",

So is their \"T\" chocolate-lil joke with the staff... hot chocolate had 2 letters fall and they hadn't fixed it yet.  Great laugh with the hostess and baristas.  Restaurant is great,  no RUSHING to get you out,  you can actually enjoy the company of those with you.   Highly recommend this restaurant!!",

Visit1: London fog not to sweet:prefer Starbucks version Salmon toast:delicious and the side salad was awesome with pumpkin seeds really nice flavor French toast toppings on side: came out cold too sweet Shaksuka: was cold kinda heavy on the tomato really thick not saucy like you get in Israel needs salt  Visit2: Flat white: served like an espresso with a small amount of milk prefer Starbucks blonde flat white Blueberry muffin: dense and flavorless almost stale tasting the blueberries were good Salmon toast: delicious just like the first time side salad was missing pumpkin seeds this time Museli: very very sweet and very mushy  Side of fruit: poorly prepped strawberries still had the white and top after the leaves were pulled off the cantaloupe and melon were not cut uniformly and were flavorless with rind  raspberries were mushy  Overall I would come back for the salmon toast everyday the rest leaves a bit to be desired. To be fare they they slammed both times and they have a well oiled machine as far as ordering and bringing stuff out.  Love that they bring you your coffee while you wait for your food!  Love having a new quick breakfast place hope they can get the flavors and execution together a little bit more would love to see this place succeed!  TIP: tables along the south side of the restaurant have so much sun its so hot and the person facing window will have the sun in their face.  They really need to figure something out before the weather gets warmer.  They had run out of silverware and so some guests were given plastic.",

You order at the counter and find a seat yourself. They'll bring the food to you. The food was quite nice and the price range goes from $6-$12 with the average around $9. Portions were decent. Everybody was content with their food. The main reason for the 5 Stars was their service. We had ordered an acai bowl and white mocha alongside with our other dishes. My brother had went up to order another dish while asking about it. They had forgotten the order, apologized, and let him get the other dish for free. Sometime later, his dish came, but the drink and acai bowl was still missing. My cousin went up and inquired again. The management had apologized profusely for the long delay and actually even gave us an extra acai bowl to go and refunded the drink and acai bowl. This was way more than we expected. So five stars for the stellar customer service",

    "text": "While Las Vegas certainly has its fair share of Brunch venues, a number that only seems to increase each day, the spots truly doing good Food remains low, particularly in the Southwest where a growing population has recently latched on to Neighbors as an answer to Egg Works, Mr. Mama's, Babycakes and all the usual Chains.  Officially open as of February and immediately making itself 'known' via Instagram, a giveaway requesting guests \"tag their Brunch Squad\" or some such nonsense drawing onlookers to a collection of Breakfast and Lunch items available from 7am to 3pm daily, it was along with a friend that Saturday around 10:30am found the space packed, one screaming child near the doors dragging the average age down from a population largely comprised of Millennials starring at their Smartphones and Soccer Moms.  Tucked away off Fort Apache and clean in design, potted plants dividing the largely communal seating area from a small foyer where guests are greeted with a menu, Neighbors encourages diners to step up and order from the counter once decisions are made, the prices of presumably housemade Pastries not disclosed save for a small laminated sheet at the register where money is exchanged for a stand featuring the party's name and number.  Busy but not particularly loud, the vibe essentially the same as Panera with inoffensive music overhead, it was shortly after exchanging $25 including tax and tip that a party of two found seats at a long wooden table, a trio of Cookies staff had offered to 'warm up' arriving shortly and merely room temperature with the Snickerdoodle pleasant and buttery inside a crispy rim while both Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chip were unremarkable save for a price tag of $2.50 each, just a nickel less than all three would have cost for better quality at Sweet Addiction up the road.  Passing on Coffee, the fact that Neighbors uses Beans locally roasted by Vesta a feather in their cap, it was after perhaps ten minutes with Water self-filled and even utensils not delivered that a $12 plate of French Toast arrived featuring Granola, sliced Strawberries without their tops removed and a round of unmelted \"Honey Whipped Butter,\" the meal's  most memorable moment occurring when a young man nearby ate the whole thing assuming it was \"Fruit,\" the humor likely lost on him both as a result of the shock and subsequently being forced to eat Bread that is poorly permeated and doughy without much Syrup and almost no flavor on its own.  **Featuring 2018 paint-by-the-#gram design and plates that look better than they taste Neighbors seems to be exactly what it sets out to be and nothing more discerning palates need to waste time or calories on, the same quality and better service offered at Panera or Kneaders for less and a far superior Breakfast available at CRAFTkitchen, Served or Kitchen Table in Henderson or even Squeeze-In, Mimosa's Gourmet, Babystacks and Bite just a few minutes away.",

They do not do refills and or substitute the menu.  I told her I would like to order a cold brew and then if I could just refill it with regular coffee and it seemed like it was a big deal.  I wanted to upgrade my toast to pancakes and like stated before no substitutions.  I ordered a side of pancakes, my meal and a cold brew and it was 22$ I was like damnnnnn and when the food came out there wasn't much to it very bland and boring.  My eggs and potatoes came with a big salad which I thought was a weird side for breakfast hahahh I do love the feel of the restaurant and how everyone has a purpose and they keep it clean and organized but unfortunately I dont think I'll be back for a min.",

The counter service is unique, pastry program and coffee are great.   The kitchen on the other hand needs some work, missing items both times we visited, and raw pork sausage this time. They deep fry their sausage and don't seem to use a proper thermometer to check if they pork has been cooked to temp. The chef at the pass doesn't seem to read tickets very well either as he has his runners asking the table if we received everything. We received dishes that would seemingly take longer than 2 plates of scrambled eggs. All of the counter staff and runners  are very kind and understanding. We will be back to give them one last chance to catch their sea legs.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to try this place for a while but it always gets too late as they close in the afternoon, but I have to say, I wasn't disappointed! You walk in and find a lovely light space with lots of plants. It's very clean and open. Walking up to the counter, the lady behind it was very friendly and helpful, she gave us menus and helped talk us through it when I had some questions, as well as offer me a taster of their in-house lavender syrup as they have a lavender latte that I'd never tried before. We ordered the breakfast sandwich, breakfast burrito and lavender latte and they all arrived in good time and the burrito in particular was a good size. The latte was very good - I could taste the lavender but it wasn't overly sweet. The food was also good. I was disappointed that the burrito arrived with about 4 pieces of diced tomato as 'pico de gallo' and nothing in the burrito itself, but the lady (manager, I assume) who was maintaining the floor offered amazing service and brought some more over with some cutlery and a takeaway box for us straight away. The only things that led to my 4 star review rather than 5 was that it is a little pricey. For 2 brunches and 1 drink it was nearly $35 and for a casual cafe, this seems a little steep. Also, the open space is lovely, but with a lot of people enjoying lunch, it can get very noisy and difficult to hear yourself think. I would definitely return for one of this lavender lattes though. It was great!",

Chairs aren't the most comfortable for sitting long periods of time and I wish there were some booths for hanging out a little longer.   On to the food- husband got the STEAK & EGGS* 8oz ribeye, housemade chimichurri, farm eggs, smashed potatoes, greens, choice of toast. We thought the dish was excellent and cooked well.   I got the MUSHROOM burger- Premium ground beef, mushroom medley, arugula, caramelized crispy onions, herb aioli. Again tasty and cooked well. I got it on a piece of lettuce since I'm reducing carbs. I thought the side salad that it came with could use a little more to it. I also would have loved some more mushrooms on the burger. Overall it tasted good though.   I loved the lavender latte!!! I have to admit I've ordered a few at other restaurants and the fake lavender taste is so gross. They told me they make their own lavender syrup and I could tell. I'm glad I gave it a chance.   I didn't feel their menu was very big and didn't have too many choices I was interested in. But sometimes a small menu is a good thing.   Service was more like get up and get your own condiments and whatever you need. The person who delivered the food never returned.   I would return here with friends if we could make it in time before they close. Welcome to the neighborhood Neighbors!",

My only gripes are: 1) their drinks are served in small glasses and are per priced per glass. 2) the recommended tips start at 18%, which is very high for a non full-service restaurant.  These issues aren't big deals and can be worked out in the future, so I'm not worried. We'll definitely be back to try other dishes and the coffee. Good luck neighbors!",

I got the lavender lemonade but tasted nothing like lavender but still refreshing and delicious. I also got the steak and it was very delicious! The only thing that I have to knock down points for is that my friend got her food 15 minutes before I did and the food runner that dropped it off had no smile , no eye contact when dropping off the food and didn't even put it near us. A little weird but I will still return!",

Few things didn't like, you order at counter and they bring your food, but with these prices I would have expect to be more like restaurant with waiters. We have to get our own water, nobody came around to check on us, only if we were done with our plate. They have a lot of workers standing at counter only to drop off food and pick up plates????? I saw chef come out, even possible owner,  still didn't come around and ask if everything ok???? Hmmmm.  I would go again for the food.",

YUM! The coffee was kinda sour...should have opted for espresso. Glad I stopped in!",

Their menu is next to the cash register, and you choose where you sit. I had the French toast, which had granola oats and strawberries around it. I also had cup of the Queen Bee latte. My sister had a Bacon Chipotle Burger with a side of fries. We were pretty satisfied with out food. Unfortunately, I only took a photo of my latte (guess I was looking forward to eating my French toast that I forgot to take a photo!). Their items are a little pricey, but their portions are huge. The French Toast itself had me stuffed. I'm looking forward to going back and trying out the rest of their menu!",

    "text": "Rudest Barista! I am a PM delivery person. I go into Neighbors frequently and it's normally an in and out experience. However on this beautiful Sunday morning I experienced something I can honestly say I'll remember as meeting one of the rudest human beings especially in customer service. I went to the counter and mentioned I was here for my PM order. I was told it would be a few more minutes for the order to be done. So I went to sit down at one of the tables out of the way and on the side. The same waiter who said the order was not ready came to me and bought me a cup of coffee and said here for you. I thought what an awesome gesture for me waiting a little longer. Restaurants are know give a drink when you have to wait for an order so I didn't think twice. I just said thank you and I was indeed thankful! About 5 minutes later after half way through the cup of coffee, the Barista made her way to me and grabbed the coffee and said, This wasn't for you. I looked at her as if she was joking because I was stunned. She said it again, it's not for you and are you ordering something for yourself. I said no I'm waiting for an order. She then walked away not another word with the half full cup of coffee. Then the same waiter came a minute later and gave me the order I was waiting for. Not a sorry or a single other word.   Some will say, geez it's just a cup of coffee or well you didn't order. But really people, be kind to others. It was just a cup of coffee but her action stung me like a bee sting. Someone's actions can speak volumes in humanity.   I gave 5 stars because we all know yelp doesn't post bad reviews if the reviews are paid for. I also want people to read this so maybe they can share more acts of kindness instead of rudeness. #bekind",

People seemed really obsessed with taking selfies by the plants in the front of the door entrance.    Didn't like the ordering situation and hope that changes.   We did enjoy watching the chef/ cooks prepare the food.  Chefs and cooking profession isn't always looked upon as an art or respectable and the viewing concept allows you to see the work out in and appreciate what goes in to what they do.  Don't know if we went on two off days??",

Don't get me wrong, the inside is absolutely exquisite and airy- totally feels like you're in California. 5 out of 5 stars for atmosphere. As for the pastries and coffee.... the barista recommended I try the vegan peanut butter oat muffin and I don't think I've ever made a worse choice. This was literally the driest muffin I've ever had- i dont know if it was stale or what, but it was disgusting. I know vegan stuff is sometimes more dense and dry but this was not your normal vegan pastry. It was just a dry piece of bread basically. It had no flavor whatsoever and made my mouth extremely dry trying to chew it. My boyfriends coffee cake was also dry. Maybe it was just a bad batch of pastries that morning?  I ordered the honey bee latte - it was mediocre. He ordered the americano with vanilla. Not sure what happened with that either, we got the drink and the espresso and syrup was not mixed whatsoever. The bottom of the cup was an inch of clear syrup and when drinks are not mixed before being served, that's nasty. Totally disappointed I spent $17 on some mediocre pastries and drinks at best.",

You order at the counter and they give you a little name plate to set on your table. I got the iced chai latte and it wonderful! I also got the breakfast sandwich with roasted red potatoes. The red potatoes were like nothing I've ever tasted before, it was a perfect balance between taste and texture. We also got two large cookies, one chocolate chip and one snickerdoodle. They heat them up for you and they are soft and perfect. We will be back to try the rest of the food on the menu!",

I placed the order at the counter then the person behind the counter asked if the sandwich my boyfriend was ordering wanted it on sourdough white or while grain. So I had to go back to the table we were sitting at and ask him his preference. I get back to the counter and then she ask what he wants for his side on the same order. I wish she had asked me all the options before going back to the table for a second time. I finally just got him to come to the counter. You have to get your own water which is annoying especially when I'm having to leave a tip for the waiter whose only job is to bring you your food and bus your table. I'm knocking off a star for the major inconvenience of the set up. Food was quite tasty and at a good price for what you got. All and all I'll probably come back but would rather the server take my food order in the future and fill my water    Came back for a second time and it sounds like this place is transitioning to a better setup. I'll be real happy when that finally goes into affect. On another note, people would probably have an easier time finding this place if the sign to it looked more permanent. Right now you can easily pass by this place because the sign looks temporary like a future development sign. A little confusing. But no shortage of business at this place. It's been full every time I've come here",

    "text": "Yelper/Instafriend Kenny T. gave me the heads up on Neighbors, and we finally got to brunch there after church.  To save you the hassle, follow these important helpful tips:  1)As you enter, head towards the wall of plants towards the \"ORDER HERE\" sign where the cashier is, take a look at the menu, place your order, then pay for your order...simple, right???  2)While paying, you'll have an option to leave a tip(10-20%) AS WELL AS A NO TIP OPTION...In no way are you being pressured to leave a tip up front like some reviews state. You can also leave a tip on the table after your experience instead. Duh???  3)BEFORE YOU FIND A TABLE TO SIT AT, and depending on what you ordered, grab your personalized nameplate, silverware, napkins, water, and condiments, etc. *Yes, it's a self-service concept, and  if this is too much for you after reading these three steps, because you feel it's the waiter's responsibility, go elsewhere...  While waiting for our order, I observe the kitchen and front of the house hustling to get the orders out, and something you almost always don't see is the floor manager bussing tables, and the Executive Chef Tom running food to tables. Great to see a team effort such as this where everyone works together towards the same goal to provide a great experience.  Our order arrives 15-20 minutes later: two Lavender Lattes, Breakfast Sandwich, Ribeye Steak and Eggs with Chimichurri, and some warm chocolate chip, snickerdoodle, and peanut butter cookies. Wifey enjoyed her sandwich and my steak and eggs were perfectly medium rare as I requested. We finished our meal with our cookies and lattes. Everything was DELICIOUS!!! Waitstaff bussed tables and refilled waters accordingly, and honestly,  the quality of the food served to the price point is very reasonable.  Other reviews complain about staff hanging out at the counter and not tending to customers. They were referring to the floor manager and executive chef(who I mentioned earlier)oh, and the waiter \"doing nothing but facing his back to you the whole time\" is actually THE EXPIDITER, whose responsibility is to STAY THERE, communicate with the kitchen, and control the flow of the tickets, so that each order comes up in a timely manner.  Great first visit after only being open for four weeks, stellar service, and already looking forward to coming back soon. Another tidbit... By looking at most of the 1 to 3 starred reviews, they should tell you a few things and raise a few red flags...  1)These people are probably regulars at Mickey D's drive thru and comfortable with the  dollar menu complaining about wait times and prices, SMH....  2)These are picky people that are very set in their ways, not open to change and new, different concepts, and have NO CLUE on how a restaurant operation works...  3)NEVER trust reviews, especially those with single digits(and no real pictures). Yelp Elite reviewers are much more accurate. Let those reviews help you decide if you want to plan to dine here...  RECOMMENDATIONS:  -Ribeye Steak and Eggs with Chimichurri Sauce and Smashed New Potatoes  -Get the Sourdough bread to wipe up all that chimichurri goodness  -Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookies (get 'em warmed up!)  -Lavender Latte (great with the cookies!)  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  5",

We ordered a breakfast sandwich with my choice of sourdough bread.  Now I don't know where their sourdough comes from, but being that I am from the Bay Area i am a bit picky with sourdough, and this was some of the best sourdough bread I have had, imagine that.  The sandwich consisted of more like an omelette than a scramble like it states in the description and included sausage, bacon, greyer cheese, and arugula. Pretty sure you could request your eggs to be made to your liking, but it was perfect for me! I also selected the potatoes which were incredibly delicious, some the best I have had!!! I also had a bite of my husbands steak and eggs and that was also incredible!    When ordering at the counter take a look at their display case immediately to the left full of delicious sweetness.  We tried their Snickerdoodle, Peanut Butter, and Chocolate Chip cookies warmed up which went well with our tasty Lavender Lattes... so delicious.    Service was great and everyone looked happy to be here!  I can't wait to come back and try some of their other offerings.  Kudos to the kitchen and to all staff! Very impressed!",

We ordered the avo toast, french toast, lavender latte and the white mocha. Even though it was Saturday brunch, it wasn't hard to find seats at all. We sat down and got our food pretty quickly. Everything was soooo delicious! I especially loved the lavender latte. I've tried many lavender latte and I've got to say this one was comparable to the one I had in NYC! The avo toast was great as well with a poached egg on top! The french toast was tasty, especially with the added granola!    I cannot wait to come back to try more! Really looking forward to try their other lattes. I love the vibe and the self-serving systme seem to be my thing, I feel like it prevents the restaurant from having long waits. People kind of just eat and go, instead of having to wait to get seated and wait for a server to serve you. Definitely a must try brunch spot in Vegas!",

They serve you your food HOWEVER they ask for your NAME instead of giving you a random number. It's admirable that little things like that make people feel special!! :)    FOOD 5/5: -Pacific Smoked Salmon ($11): They had a good portion of salmon on this. And the salad that came with it complimented the fish. -Wild Berry Parfait ($7): Although this is kinda pricey for a parfait, there was a lot of fruit + the yogurt was thick & delicious!  -The Fun Guy ($12): THIS IS A MUST-GET BURGER. I'm not a vegetarian but i LOVE this burger. It has a fried parmesan eggplant with peppers & grilled portabella (mushrooms) + it comes with CHOICE of fries, sweet potato fries or greens  CONS:  -NO alcohol :( I wish I had a mimosa with my meal, that would have been perfect lol",

    "text": "Such an amazing addition to the Neighborhood! From service to food everything has been a positive experience so far. And huge plus that it's just walking distance from my job!  It located on Oquendo and Forte Apache in a small lot that can be quite easy to miss. There is tons of parking, however I noticed when I went on a Sunday it got pretty crowded and cars were parking in the dirt lot next door.   Menu is not big but quality is always better than quantity. So far I have tried their Shakshuka, Salmon Toast, Coconut Pancakes, Breakfast Burrito and a little bit of my friends Steak and Eggs. I have also tried their Queen Bee Latte, Lavender Latte, Chai Latte and Matcha Latte.   Shakshuka with sourdough bread has been my favorite. So good that I went there two days in a row and ordered just that lol. I feel like there just isn't enough bread to eat it with though :( also there is no meat included but my bf ordered sausage on the side and it was even better with the meat.   Coconut pancakes would be my second favorite. The lemony syrup they use just absorbs into pancake nicely and the berries and toasted coconut go great together. And I'm not even a fan of dried coconuts.   Breakfast burrito was delicious and Salmon toast was just ok. It was pretty much a Nova Lox bagel replaced with a slice of sourdough.   Now the lattes. I would rate it as Lavender, Queen Bee, Chai then Matcha. Lavender had the most flavor and was the best tasting IMO. Queen Bee was also really good. It was a slight taste of honey and a lot of cinnamon. Chai latte wasn't anything special and Matcha lacked in flavor.   Service was good all the times I've went. Nothing bad to say there.   Definitely recommend stopping by here.",

We all really enjoyed the restaurant and the food.  You order at a counter and the staff brings you your dishes, which was super fast.    Mint Lemonade - 3 stars  Really not worth getting.  You don't really taste the mint at all.  Maybe try some thai basil to add more flavor?  Breakfast Sandwich - 5 stars It was dynamite and the char flavor on the bread was nice.  It reminded me of the food from The Stove, except that it didn't take more than an hour to receive.  I would order this again and again.  Chicken Sandwich - 5 stars My wife ordered this.  It was dynamite.  I would order this again.    Looking forward to going back and trying new items!",

The people had chill vibes were very prompt with my pickup order because I like eating breakfast at home lol. I got the berry parfait and frittata. The parfait was very sweet with their house made berry jam and added honey but the fresh fruit and Greek yogurt cut the sweetness and made it one of my top five favorite parfaits. The frittata tasted fresh and not like old baked egg and the arugula was a great green and spice factor and this will be my go to meal until I'm ready to venture out and try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "Neighbors is a welcome sight in the very up-and-coming area of the Southwest. The brightly lit white interior is very reminiscent of my days visiting coffee shops in LA, particularly Silver Lake. Minus the rude baristas.   Their menu is kept simple with a few healthy options, griddle toasts and traditional breakfast fare. I was a particular fan of the chicken and waffles and enjoyed the cornflake crusted tenders with the sweet chili maple drizzle. The savory chive waffles were a bit disappointing with how soggy the waffles got, and how I didn't particularly taste the chive element. But, I was very pleasantly surprised by the breakfast diversity with the shakshouka, a traditionally Middle Eastern and North African dish.   For sweets, I loved the coconut pancakes (mostly because I'm a fan of coconuts). The stacks were fluffy and there was a generous amount of blueberries, lemon syrup, and honey whipped butter. As for their specialty coffees, their lattes are more on the sweeter side, but the lavender did taste good. They have plenty of outlets and USB plugs on their walls, but the atmosphere is a little bit too loud for reading or studying IMO.",

It's spacious seating area has dark wooden  low-profile tables and cute succulents to give a fresh atmosphere.  From the Yelp pictures and reviews I was attracted to ordering the breakfast sandwich (warm scrambled eggs with flavorful sausage and a thick slab of bacon topped with arugula, gruyere cheese and tangy Chipotle mayo on multigrain bread). The side salad with pumpkin seeds and watermelon radish was a delicious compliment to the sandwich. Only $8!   Both the lunch and the iced queen bee latte (honey and cinnamon) was a \"Wow!\" experience! Hours are 6am-3pm, prices are very reasonable, and make sure to help yourself to the fruit infused water.

They also have good drinks here but I ordered the strawberry lemonade the first time I visited. It is a seasonal drink but I definitely recommend it! It's not too sweet and very refreshing. Borderline addicting! So back to the food. The first thing I noticed is that the portion sizes for the price is pretty good! When it comes to the actual dishes (just the two I've tried), they are definitely filling but I can't put my finger on what's missing when it comes to the flavor of the food. Don't get me wrong it's not bland, but I was expecting more. The ingredients are very fresh and the food isn't too greasy or heavy. Still worth trying and I still came back! I also would recommend coming early because seating is first come first served. If you come at a busy time or have a larger party, there's a chance you'll be waiting a little while for a table to open up. And the line gets long.",

I'm not a morning person, but I woke up an extra hour before work and drove across town to have breakfast here two mornings in a row. Clearly they're doing something right.  Love the decor, IG aesthetic hashtag in full effect with open space and lots of plants, along with ample natural lighting for great photos. Their menu is thoughtful, with breakfast and lunch choices from healthy to indulgent, as well as a range of specialty coffee, tea, and juice beverages.   EATS: If you're in the mood for a hot breakfast or a an early lunch, try the shakshuka. I'm a huge fan of this dish and there aren't many places to get it in town. For lighter fare, try the Pacific salmon toast with a side salad. They also have a small selection of baked goods to the left of the register. Will probably try a breakfast sandwich next time!  DRINKS: Lattes, cold brews, and drip coffees galore. The Queen Bee latte has so far been my favorite, though the iced matcha is a close second. They also offer lavender, almond, hazelnut, etc. Check in for specials like their Love Potion (dark chocolate and strawberry latte) that was available for Valentines Day. I haven't even tried the juices yet. YET.",

    "text": "Omg did I just accidentally happen upon a grand opening?!? Yaaas! Honestly I was just looking for a quick bite and a coffee while in the neighborhood of my bikini waxer. How lucky am i?!  So this place is awesome.  It's a perfect addition to the plethora of brunch places in summerlin/ south west area. I think they found the only block on Ft Apache that didn't have a breakfast spot,  so I'm sure it's convenient for a bunch of people (if you can get my tone,  I'm jelly,  and I want more places near me downtown).  The ambiance is relaxed and fresh.  You order at the counter and have a nice variety of healthy and hearty to choose from.  I got the avocado toast and lavender late.  Both were delicious.  The poached egg was perfect,  and the salad on the side was to die for!    Fresh ingredients and live plants make for a really nice spot to have a solo bite,  or meet up with friends.",

    "text": "I've struggled with this review for a while now since my visit.   I'm stuck between 3 and 4 stars because, while the food was great - exceptional, even, for cafe food - the overall experience was frustrating enough to deem it disappointing.   To the venue's credit, the space is beautiful. The interior is bright, crisp, and clean with ample seating. It's insta-perfect.   However, the space is so open that, when crowded as it was when I visited, it becomes unbearably loud. I'm talking crowded bar loud. I'm talking so loud that that my voice was hoarse by the time I got home from straining to make conversation over eggs.   Furthermore, they are not the least bit equipped to handle peak hours. When not busy, approaching the counter for a menu and to place an order, self-seating, and grabbing your own utensils is a non-issue. However, when I walked in, I felt like I was thrust into the Hunger Games. I wasn't sure if I should camp out for a table, elbow my way to the front of the line for a menu, or hang my head in hands and stand by the restroom where the end of the line had formed.   After a few breaths, my family and I settled at a table. I then managed my way to the front of the line to snag a menu. This happened to the chagrin of the person who was in the middle of ordering and had completely blocked access to all of the menus available. Menu in hand, I scuttled back to the base we formed at our table and tried to piece together everyone's selections. Ready to order, I made my way to the end of the line, which was still next to the restroom. I know I stood in line for at least ten minutes before getting halfway to the register. I then watched as several guests in front of me struggled to order from a menu they had just set their eyes on. Add to this the fact that there was only one cashier who was also struggling to keep the self-serve water dispenser filled, and, well...   What makes all of this so frustrating for me is that I can't write this off completely because the food was great. My in-laws ordered the Old School. There really isn't a lot to expect from bacon or sausage, eggs, and potatoes, but I've never see plates of classic breakfast as well-prepared as the ones served that day. I had the shashuka and gobbled it up. Perfect yolk. Great flavor. Feeling like I needed to order more food than I wanted to make up for the wait, I also chose the coconut pancakes. Damn. Also, good. The pastry case was lovely. We picked a coconut chocolate chip muffin from the bunch. While it could have used more coconut flavor and less chocolate, it received high marks from the table.    It's such a shame that the visit was so frustrating. The combination of the lack of service (someone helping to seat or direct guests to the flow of the room would have helped a great deal), the stress from other guests, and the noise made the experience feel as far as possible from neighborly.   Maybe it's a me thing? Maybe I need to just avoid peak hours? Maybe it'll be better next time now that I know what to expect?",

You go directly to the counter and order your meal, then choose whatever seats are available. They turned out the food really quick our whole experience took half an hour to be served and done eating. We had the old school breakfast, the burrito which normally comes with sausage they kindly switched it to bacon for me and the French toast. The burrito was savory with bacon, avocado and round potatoes (did not care for the half round potatoes in my burrito would like it diced-felt like I was going to choke on one if I didn't notice). The highlight was the French toast. More syrup please and powder.That was a really good dessert and brought it up to a 4!   I like the vibe in the restaurant. Could use some wall decor to break up the white walls. Servers were super friendly.",

    "text": "Food:2.5/5  Services: 3/5 Environment:2/5   It's so great to have many brunch options now in the southwest area. However, this one is not my favorite unfortunately. I heard some great things about this place among friends and yelp but I'm sorry to report it did not meet my expectations. Due to the fact that I was so underwhelmed of their coffee, this place is 2 Stars for me till next time.   Service: it's alright basically non-existent. No one to greet you and let you know how the system works till you ask. You can't get a table till you order at the counter, so I would not recommend to come with a big group.   The guy at the counter not only couldn't spell but also couldn't take the order right. My friend ordered the B.L.A.T.C and the guy put breakfast sandwich instead. Also, they are now charging $.50 on sweet potato fries according to the updated menu. However, they charged her $1 instead. I mean, it's fine if you wanna charge for fries but make up your mind how much you want to charge your customers.   Environment: Way too loud in here. I could not hear anything my friend said who sat next to me. Don't expect you can hear what the other end of table is talking if you come with more than group of four.   Food: overall, it's a meh place for me in the food aspect as well. I was highly disappointed in the lavender latte since it's their signature. From there, it just went downhill.   1. Shakauka (2/5): a new brunch favorite in many trendy breakfast places. It's a middle eastern vegetarian dish. Both of my friend and I ordered this and it came out so differently. Mine was really watery saucey skillet, and hers was more dense and lack of flavor. It was like eating tomato sauce out of the can. I also wish there's more herbs in this dish either more cilantro, basil, or parsley.   2. B.L.A.T.C (3/5): the chicken in the sandwich was good. However, there was too much sauce that made the sandwich soggy. The sweet potato fries was good though.   3. Old school (4/5): this was probably my favorite dish out of everything we tried today. The sausages and potatoes were both good. I would get this next time.   I would probably try this place again till they work out some kinks and get their consistency down. For now, I will go elsewhere for Sunday brunch.",

    "text": "I have been meaning to try this place out for a while now so my husband, brother, and I decided to come here for lunch today.   I personally really liked the style of the establishment. Everything was very modern and clean. It's almost as though you walked into a cafe opened by Ikea. Best of all, it's cafeteria style almost. You order, get a sign with your name on it, pick a table, and get the utensils, water, and sauces yourself. They will deliver the food to your table when it's ready.   My husband went with their breakfast burrito, my brother got their avocado toast, and I decided to go with their mushroom burger.   The mushroom burger has arugula, swiss cheese, tomatoes, and pickles in it. The combination of flavors was really tasty. While I think the meat is slightly under seasoned, the sauce makes up for it. They use a balsamic vinegar sauce. But I still think it would be better if it was seasoned more. The pickle do add a nice flavor to it as well. The burger came with your choice of fries, sweet potato fries, or greens. I went with fries and they were really good. Nice, crispy, and just enough saltiness to it.   It was actually a ton of food and I had to take a majority of it home. I was quite full afterwards and was about to lapse into a food coma.   Aside from that, we also ordered a chocolate chip cookie. They gave the option to have it warmed first and you bet that's what the road we went down! But ... unfortunately, I would not recommend anyone to get it. The cookie was dry even when it was warmed. And when it cooled down, it was really hard.   While I understand that they do have an open kitchen and it isn't a romantic type of establishment, it was really noisy. I could barely hear what my brother was saying and he sat directly across from me. It's a little tough to socialize ...   Overall, pretty decent. It's great if you want something new, fresh, and different.",

The decor is minimal, there is a beautiful back wall with shelves. The shelves are decorated with trinkets and (you guessed it) more plants!  You order at the counter and take a seat wherever. The menu is fresh and exciting. I love that you can go on the healthy side with an acai bowl, avocado toast, or spruced up parfait. Or you can go the savory and not quite so waistline friendly route with sandwiches and decadent dishes. Even the non healthy selections are made with quality ingredients.  I ended up ordering the queen bee latte (cinnamon and honey) and it was fantastic. A little on the sweet side, but after a hike I very much welcomed the sugar. I ordered the avocado toast and sweet potato fries. The person I came with ordered the breakfast sandwich.  My  avocado toast had a poached egg on it along with some red and yellow cherry tomatoes. The only thing I thought it was missing was red pepper flakes (but I put red pepper on anything). My guests breakfast sandwich tasted amazing. There was bacon AND sausage, plus their sourdough is a delight.   All of the servers were very nice, especially considering that it was Easter morning and I'm sure that they would have rather been home or with family. They made me feel completely welcome. I can't wait to come back again and try more of their menu!",

    "text": "This place is a hotspot for hipsters and millennials! The decor is pleasantly comfortable with hanging air plants greeting you at the front door to the front desk where you place your order.  I gotta admit, at first I was a little dumb struck and confused if I had to wait to be seated, seat myself, order, or just stand around the entrance like an awkward deer in headlights. Lucky for me I always choose the latter. The hostess was nice enough to call me over though to the front and explain how their system works and handed me a menu.  I ordered the shroom burger with regular shoe string fries and my friend ordered the steak and eggs (medium rare, with eggs done over easy). The steak comes with a chimichurri sauce on top that has a slight sourness to it. The steak was very tender and juicy, while the side of potatoes have a good crisp and soft Center to them.  The shoe string fries I got were nice and crispy, but a little cold unfortunately. I'm guessing they were probably cooked first and were sitting on my plate before the burger was cooked. The shroom burger was really soft and juicy and the fried onions on it had a pleasant crisp to change up the texture of the soft patty and mushrooms.  I wasn't really into the buns though, they were kind of cold and doughy. I would have really like it more if they had cooked it or something, because it just kept reminding me of bread buns you would leave in your fridge and they would get slightly soggy from the condensation and temperature of the surrounding food.  With that exception though, the food tasted good and guilt free.. almost  I hear their coconut pancakes are good so I'm looking forward to going back eventually to try them out next time.",

    "text": "I ordered the chipotle bacon burger for lunch today. It was a decent burger, but they ignored the instructions that went along with my order.  I asked for no onions, I asked for a side of ranch, and a side of balsamic for the Salad.   They obviously read my notes because they added .50 for the ranch. That's fine.  But it didn't come with balsamic, and the burger came with onions. No big deal I'll pick them off.  However, I asked for my burger to be cooked medium. It was well done, no pink, no juices.  This place has great reviews, and I've heard a lot of good things from my colleagues, so I had to give it a try.  Not sure if I will eat here again. Sometimes it's the little things that count, especially when they ask for you to pick how you want the meat cooked, and any special instructions. Blahhhhhhhh",

I got the Old School and orange juice. Pleasantly enjoyed my orange juice considering I almost finished it all. I don't usually finish my drinks. I got over medium eggs, sourdough bread, and half half bacon & sausage. The bacon was overcooked and hard but everything else was good. The small side of salad with its dressing was considerably delish and we both enjoyed our sourdough bread.   My friend got the steak and eggs and the steak was nice and moist.   When you place your order they write your name on the tag. Order didn't take that long for us but it also wasn't jam packed. I only noticed the noise after reading some reviews but that doesn't bother me at all.   The food looks very appealing when it comes out. It's like they're telling you to take nice pictures for social media. ;)   Overall, I really enjoyed it and will be back with my sister. I will be trying out the coconut pancakes next time!  Edit:  Breakfast sandwich - super good.   Coconut pancakes - different than I expected but not too bad. Love the coconut flakes.",

    "text": "Making a slight update to this review after going today:   This place is literally my new absolute favorite brunch spot in Vegas. I first fell in love with PublicUs in downtown Las Vegas, but since it was way too far from where I live in town I needed to find a new spot and I'm so glad my gf took me here one weekend. The inside is really open and sunny and great for a small gathering or a date. The vibe of this place is earthy retro with a very endearing hipster quality to it. The servers are all super nice and so helpful.   Now to the food. OMG their breakfast sandwich is absolute heaven in my mouth. I crave it more often than not now. It's a very hearty and flavorful breakfast sandwich that just hits the spot. I like to get it with their sourdough bread. Their fries are super delicious, crispy, and thin just the way I like them. I have also tried their Hawaiian burger and it was really tasty as well. I also love their sweet beets salad with extra beets.Their cookies are very spot on as well.   I tried their breakfast burrito today and well I wasn't blown away. Only in one small corner of the burrito was a small portion of avocado crema and cheese was randomly scattered in large chunks. There were no evenly dispersed ingredients. I would like for them to add much more avocado crema and correct the uneven parts. I also wasn't a huge fan of the huge smashed potatoes that took up most of the burrito.    I'm also in love with lavender anything, so I'm also obsessed with their lavender latte. I'm sure all their drinks are equally delicious.",

    "text": "Went for a breakfast here on a Sunday morning. Got there around 9 AM to avoid the long line (the place started to get super busy at around 10.30ish) and got ourselves a corner table by the pretty wall with all the planters.   I wouldn't sit there again the next time I visit though. As the line started to form, and it continued non-stop, it wrapped around the aisle where our table was at. It was uncomfortable sitting there having our meals, while being constantly surrounded by people's sides/butts lol I felt like I was in Hong Kong during a busy meal time, where you have people waiting for your table literally at your side.   I love the beautiful decor (airy, bright, and green from all the planters; very LA), but I think the place is not set up well for the long line it's having.   The food was good. I had the steak with scrambled eggs and smashed potatoes. The steak was prepared medium rare like I asked. Not the best cut of rib eye, but what do you expect for $16. Love the chimichurri sauce, limey, zesty, and fresh, and how it coated the crisped smashed potatoes. The scrambled eggs was kinda blah. My friend had their pacific smoked salmon and gave it a thumb's up. We also tried their vegan peanut butter cookie and lemon scone. The cookie was delicious, but the scone was a bit dry.  For drinks, I had their Americano and my friend had their matcha latte. No complaints about our drinks. Our total bill for all these food was around $45, so yeah, not the cheapest breakfast. Can't say much about the service as this place is mostly a self service place. Plenty of parking as it's in an office strip mall, so it's the only place that's open on the weekend. Overall, I'd recommend to check this place out, even if it's just to get some coffee, admire the decor, and maybe take some insta-worthy pics lol.",

This is the first time I've seen or heard of Shakshuka but it looked good so I ordered it .Shakshuka ($10.00) and is a vegetarian dish that is made of poached eggs,  stewed tomatoes, bell pepper, chili, feta and toast. I'm not a vegetarian but I don't need meat at every meal either. It was delicious! I wish it came with more bread though. Once I ran out of bread I still had a lot more left so I ordered more bread. (I couldn't bring myself to eat it by itself)...because bread makes everything better! I also ordered some coconut pancakes ($10.00) to share. It was made with berry lemon compote, toasted coconut chips and honey whipped butter. It was really good and worth a try! I felt regal that morning so I downed my breakfast with a Queen bee Latte ($5.00). Beat the crowd and come in before 8am!",

The menu doesn't even begin to explain how good their food is. I saw \"breakfast burrito\" and upon ordering it and assuming it would be ordinary... boy was I wrong (check pictures). It was filled with sausage, egg, cheese, bacon, potato, avocado creme and spicy mayo. MY GOSH DID I WANT TO TAKE A FEW HOME. This was probably the best breakfast burrito I had ever eaten and I swear I'll probably never get one from Roberto's or Egg and I again... it'll never compare to this one. My boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was also pretty tasty and we both got coffees. I feel the coffee menu was lacking a little compared to most places but... the FOOD OH MY.  Definitely \"wowed\" and will surely be stopping by occasionally for brunch.",

    "text": "Walking into the place I was greeted right away with menus, including their new summer menu, told it was open seating, and to fall in line to order when ready. The decor was clean and simplistic with lots of foliage. I decided to order a chai latte (decide between hot and ice, $4.50) and the Pina burger (mid-rare) with a side of fries ($13). I was served within about 3 minutes for my chai latte and 7 for the burger which was pretty speedy for how busy they were. The burger comes with lettuce, tomato, Monterey Jack cheese, egg, grilled pineapple, in-house pickled beets, and an herb aioli. The burger was cooked to temp and the sweetness of the pineapple balanced well with the bitter beet. The chai latte was simply nice.   Critiques:  Service: The service is a bit confusing to be served our food but to get our own utensils, condiments, and napkins. I can't tell if it's suppose to be a self serve fast food cafe or casual dining. Servers don't really check up on you, only interaction you'll receive is receiving food and when plates are taken away.  Chai Latte: Simple and sweet.  Pina Burger and fries: Bun could've been toasted a bit more, a lil soft in the center. The burger patty was not seasoned at all, very bland flavoring. The pineapple was a bit on the softer side and could be grilled for a bit longer. Not enough aioli. The fries were dreadful. Unseasoned, undercooked, and tasted like the oil in the frier hasn't been swapped out in a week. Did not take another bite.   Overall, the service is forgettable, and the food is average at best, which is a let down for how wonderful the place looks. Probably will not be back.",

When you get inside it is surprisingly spacious and has a very light and pleasant tone, lots of plants and lighting. First time we came i had a basic breakfast with eggs, sausage, potatoes and salad; i did not enjoy the taste of the potatoes much or the sausage for that matter. THIS TIME however i had the shakshuka which was bomb, it comes in an iron on along with your choice of bread and it is super tasty and filling. The girlfriend got a mushroom burger, which i had a bite of, and it was very tasty also. We had also ordered iced coffee that just didn't taste quite right and I'm not a big fan of no refills for any drinks other than water. The staff is very friendly and attentive as well.    I will say as a side note that because of the acoustics in the building a large party can easily encompass the whole room and it could get annoying to try and converse as it became a battle of who could talk louder. Could've just been those rude guests, but just thought I'd throw that in there.",

My friend who I convinced to go there with me for the 1st time didn't get great service. I was embarrassed. I had told her how amazing it was. She asked 4 times for her sourdough toast to have MELTED butter on it and they gave her dry toast with NO butter. She was frustrated and I don't blame her. It's expensive. Worth the money if your order is how u asked. When she asked for melted butter the other lady (not who took the order) looked at her like . She didn't understand I guess. It was a odd day at Neighbors for sure. Then I asked for more salad dressing and it took 2 cooks and another lady to figure other what I wanted and pour it.  needless to say they need help in communication.",

It's kinda farm type decor with lots of plants which I like. The staff are very nice and despite the fact that they were very busy we got out food relatively quickly. I ordered the AVO and it was nothing short of amazing. I was skeptical about the side salad with the honey Dijon dressing but it was good too. I'd recommend this place for anyone who enjoys a fast delicious, healthy meal.",

Order at the counter, get a number and wait at your table for the food to be delivered.  My wife ordered the coconut pancakes (berry lemon compote, toasted coconut chips and honey whipped butter) that huge in size and low in flavor sans the compote.  I tried the shakshuka (poached eggs, stewed tomatoes, bell peppers, chili and feta) that came with toasted sourdough bread.  The eggs were buried somewhere under the tomatoes, the feta was limited to a few small pieces and the overall flavor came up short.  This restaurant appears to substitute quantity for quality with prices higher than warranted.",

You start at the counter to order then take your seat, the food is brought to you.  They have a water station with a lemon, lime and strawberry water or just cold water, self serve.  They had a bogo coffee special, so we bought an iced white mocha with almond milk and an iced queen bee with almond milk. It was smooth, not bitter and so yummy!  We also bought the breakfast sandwich with potatoes (which are so soft and crispy!) and a breakfast burrito sub the sausage for bacon. The food was absolutely amazing and the sauce  oh gosh.  This is a must try place! We'd compare it to PublicUs downtown but with fresher food and a simplistic atmosphere.",

All of it was delicious! Service was fine. It's one of those restaurants where you wait in line to order, find a table, and then your food is delivered to you.

The beverage menu items all sounded amazing, like matcha green tea, macchiato, London fog, but I got their lavender latte.  My latte came with a pretty heart latte art!   I got the vegetarian sandwich called \"the FUN GUY\" and it sure was a lot of fun to eat!

There's mostly large tables to create the community dining experience.   We were warmly greeted and everyone was very nice and welcoming throughout. I had a yummy queen bee latte. Not too sweet. Very good (although could have been hotter). I was most pleased with my breakfast sandwich. Portion is huge. It was scrumptious and the salad on the side is not an afterthought garnish. It was delicious! Pumpkin seeds and watermelon radish added texture and visual appeal. Dressing was tasty and light.   Many bakery items to choose from. I didn't taste them but my boys seemed pleased with the muffin and banana bread.   Hubby got the avocado toast which looked great! Again....nice portion. Lots of avocado. He said it needed salt and a nice drizzle of some quality olive oil to bring it to perfection.   Alas...we will return. And soon! Prices are more than fair. Food is really good. Atmosphere is lovely.

Pricey for the level of service - you have to go get your own coffee accouterments (a disaster waiting to happen as people run around in an already tight space with large mugs of hot coffee fighting to get the last bit of creamer right next to the front door), you have to self serve for your condiments including salt and pepper (nice awkward moment having to ask to take them from another table because none are left up front), yet still charging full service restaurant prices.  I had the \"Old School\" - standard eggs, potatoes, bacon, toast.  It's served in a bowl which made it kind of cumbersome to eat, but fine. My boyfriend had the breakfast sandwich - both were good.  Nothing amazing, but good. Coffee was very good.   A couple of other things - it's insanely warm in this restaurant.  Do not sit by the windows.  Not sure what they will do come summer.  Also, there are these out of place plant fixtures throughout which I suppose are designed to create a break in the dining space, but they are a hazard!  Lawsuit waiting to happen.    Hope they work through some of these kinks.  I can walk to this place and was excited, but I think the concept needs some work.",

    "text": "Finally decided to give this spot a try for a brunch date with a friend on a Saturday at 11am. The atmosphere is very open and inviting and the place was pretty busy but not overwhelming. You seat yourself and order from the counter but there is a server(?) who walks around checking on tables and runs your food to you once it's ready. I ordered the coconut pancakes with blueberry compote and my friend order an acai bowl. We both went with white mocha lattes and they were extremely good. Frothy and perfectly blended the whole way through. We spent $29 pre-tip for our order (so that helps gives you a price point). My pancakes came out first and were delicious; I highly recommend them! But, we did have to wait almost 10 mins after I received my food for my friend to get his acai bowl. Which was strange. He said it was alright but he said the ones at Jamba Juice are better- not the best out there either but better and cheaper than Neighbors. (Just relaying the tip.) All in all though I enjoyed this place and will be coming back again. :)",

Not to mention, the food is very good and is served fast. I've had their french toast, the old school, and their breakfast burrito, which were all good and every time I order, I get my food in less than 10 minutes!
