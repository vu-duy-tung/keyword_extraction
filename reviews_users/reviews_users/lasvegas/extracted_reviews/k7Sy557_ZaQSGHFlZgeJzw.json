So I like to imagine that I do have a bubby and she wants me to eat more corned beef hash and eggs.  In Vegas, Weiss is the best option for a tasty Jewish breakfast option:   Bagels -- check.  Best bagels in town and an absolutely top-notch everything bagel.    Cream cheese and lox -- check.  I'm not a lox fan, but I took a smoked salmon fan here and she audibly moaned in appreciation of the fresh smoked salmon on cream cheese and a bagel,  Like I said, I don't really get the lox love, but this place has earned it.  Eggs -- check.  Perfectly prepared over-easy eggs.  Not too greasy.  Soft and runny yolks.  Love 'em.  Corned-Beef Hash -- check.   Rich and quality beef.  If you've only had hash frozen or out of a can, it will shock you how rich freshly-prepared hash tastes.  Fresh fruit -- check.  Add it all up and my imaginary bubby loves that I found this place.",

If I remember correctly it was a corned beef sandwich that I had a pickle and potato salad I believe there was something wrong with the potato salad or the mayonnaise even the thought of that sandwich to this day makes me sick to my stomach I missed 4 days of work because of that.

    "text": "Let me start by saying I think I just had a subpar experience. This is a little lengthy, but hear me out.  I went here with 4 other adults. Three of us arrived and sat and the other 2 joined within about 5 minutes. We waited hardly any time for someone to take our drink order, but there was a significant wait for our order. I order the pancake breakfast with eggs over hard, bacon, and I tried to order home fries with no onions. I was told that was not possible to do without onions. I asked if there were any potato options without onions and she said no. So I asked if I could get corned beef hash instead and she was going to charge me as a side (full price, not a sub price). I didn't want to tack on an extra $5.25 to my price and didn't think that was completely fair so I passed. The options I was given were a side of tomatoes or fruit, which I didn't want either. I asked if I could just get extra bacon and she agreed. I feel like these are pretty lame options just because someone doesn't like onions, but such is my life. Then after asking for bacon the waitress said \"there are onions in the corned beef hash anyway.\" Uh, ok. Not sure why that wasn't mentioned when I asked to get them. That would have saved a lot of back and forth.  The food finally arrives and it looks great. The syrup on the other hand.... not good. It came with 2 very large pancakes and I was given 2 small packs of kraft syrup. The syrup was nasty. It was thicker than honey and had to be spread with a knife. My mom had the same meal and told the waitress, \"um the syrup....\" and she interrupted and said \"oh, I know what you're going to say\" and quickly walked off. She came back with a pack warmed up from hot water. It made no difference at all. Hot or lukewarm, the syrup was thick and nasty. It was a below average pancake experience, which I didn't know was even possible. To make this not a complete bitch-fest, the eggs and bacon were cooked right at least.  The waitress was busy and believe me, I have very reasonable expectations from servers since I used to work in a restaurant. She was very short with us. She was foreign so I know that is a factor, but sometimes you need to show some empathy when you have to tell someone bad news, or when they ask things from you.  I have heard such great things from Weiss deli that I was looking forward to eating here, but was let down. If I could make a recommendation to them would be to have better syrup, and able to pour from a container. The syrup was so thick and messy (and not tasty) my hands were sticky, and the bathroom was locked so I couldn't wash them.   I would come here again, but I wouldn't order the same thing. I tasted my husband's french toast and it was very good. He had strawberries and whip cream on them so he didn't use the syrup. I noticed most of their food had onions, so I think my choices would be limited if they won't let me hold the onions. I'm not in a hurry to come back though.",

    "text": "We absolutely LOVE this restaurant. I'm going to give lots of praise to the the wonderful food and busy accommodating service, however I do have a huge complaint I hope management would take into consideration and address someday. First the food... it is tasty, well prepared, always fresh, perfectly deli-ish, plentiful,  and priced fairly.  We've probably gone for breakfast there about 50 times, and it has never disappointed. Special shout out to one particular server Jacques who is super on top of things and polite. But now, a major complaint we have... it would never stop us from coming back, but we are begging Weiss to install baby changing stations in the bathrooms! The single bathrooms seem to have plenty of room for the wall mounted pull down kind, and there's even often a bunch of supplies in the way which is already a bit of an eye sore. I get that the place is busy and cramped, but they really do need to get a touch more family friendly in this regard. It's hard to sit anywhere with a carrier to begin with, and no changing table just makes it that much harder to want to come back.  Lastly, two minor nit picks... please consider flavored individual coffee creamers, and please consider some crayons and drawing sheets for kids. You're wonderful Weiss, I just hope you can make your guests a bit more comfortable.",

    "text": "I almost missed out and ordered a simple Everything and Lox.    The waitress suggested, instead, the Lox platter.  I am glad she did.  The in-house, hand-sliced Lox pretty much put to instant shame any Lox I ever had when living in New York.  It literally made me swoon when coupled with the fresh fruits and veggies on the platter (including good grade olives and a pickled green tomato).  My colleague ordered the Hash, and said it was comparable to what his grandmother used to make.  He encouraged me to try it, although I have never liked Corned Beef Hash, I figured I'd give it a chance.  I am now a fan, at least of Weiss' Hash; enough of a fan that I may order that the next time I am visiting.  And there will be a next time, if I have anything to say about it.  It's worth a  cab ride from the strip.  Just make sure you don't get long-hauled via the Interstate.",

I normally tip every server especially since we live in Vegas but when I encounter poor service I refuse to tip. For a server to follow you out of the establishment and yell,  \" Wait until you come next time!\" is unacceptable. It's unfortunate to see family operated business hire staff like \"Margie\" who don't belong in the hospitability food and beverage industry. It is why many people would rather go to Applebees's or Chilli's where service to customers are followed by strict corporate standards. I will never eat here again!!!",

If this were a skit on TV, you would say, impossible. Could never happen in real life.   Dinner today at Weiss Deli. The server finally took our order once we asked. I asked for my beverage, and the appetizer first. Neither ever arrived before the food. I asked twice more for my beverage. The response each time was \"he is getting it\". I never quite understood who 'he' was. It finally came, but only halfway through my meal. Guess he finally got around to it.   The appetizer never came. We asked, she said she forgot. I guess with all the fun in the back room, it's easy to forget. You see, the staff could be heard throughout the restaurant loudly talking and laughing in the back area. This is while we wait and wait for service? I felt bad we were such a nuisance, it surely will never happen again.       During the meal, no sighting of the server at all. Nothing such as 'do you need anything else', or 'is your food ok?' We did need some things, but figured, what's the use unless we get up and go into the kitchen.   As we ate, one guy stacking chairs in half the restaurant, mopping floors, etc. Are you KIDDING ME? Who does this while customers trying to eat a nice meal? I felt like I was eating in a bathroom. Blatant disregard for customers.   I would like to share with the owner that although it might be difficult to find decent help, you have missed the mark completely. I cannot believe this could be your customary level of service, and hope you are as shocked reading this, as we were with the level of service. You need to take action immediately and find staff that understands how to deliver at least mediocre service. But surely, for the prices, your customers ultimately deserve good service.   There is no need for the food review. It doesn't matter how the food was, because no sensible person would go back and subject themselves to this nonsensical theater of the absurd.",

The matzoh ball chicken noodle soup is delectable and the small order is only $5.95, but it's more than enough to warm the stomach and soul. And, that matzoh is one big ball! I loved it so much that I came back a week later for another dose plus a half pastrami on rye sandwich--a delectable duo.

Good, but not worth all of the exclamation marks!!!!!!! and CAPITALS LETTERS i saw on previous reviews.   3/5, maybe I need to give it another try.",

Food is exactly as I remembered it. Actually better. At first I was planning to order the pastrami burger, then the open face turkey sandwich.... But thank goodness I kept looking, because I found the open face brisket with mashed & gravy and immediately remembered why I love this place. This is totally a cheat meal for me, but who cares when it is this delicious!   The bf also had difficulty deciding on one thing. He kept going back & forth between the sandwiches named after famous people. He ended up getting the pastrami sandwich with Russian dressing & liver pate/mouse (not exactly sure but that's what it looked/tasted like to me. *He's asleep so I can't ask him. Anyway whatever it was, the sandwich was ginormous. Crazy big. When I took my obligatory I have to try everything bite... I actually had to first bite the bottom pastrami part them go back for a second bite of the list pate. After I took the bite... The bf said it didn't even look like I had taken a bite. Seriously the sandwich was big.   He also ordered a black/white shake, and I love a place that has fresh brewed ice tea.  I know it's common... But  I consider iced tea to be a treat for myself so I'm always sad when the place has that fake soda iced tea nonsense.   Our service was quick & friendly. It took us longer than normal (which is usually typical for us) to order, but our server was very good. And came back right as we had just decided. Kept our drinks refilled & brought us to go boxes without us having to ask.  Also the French fries (served with his sandwich) were quite good. I liked dipping them in my gravy.",

    "text": "Woot woot!  New after church breakfast favorite!    My 8 year old gets a little fussy about going shopping after church.  We were heading into TJ when I decided to detour into Weiss's.  My plan was to buy her a black and white cookie.  This was derailed.  \"I want to eat here.  I need pancakes.  It's daddy's birthday.\"  Boy, that kid did have a point.  So this little treasure is tucked away in the corner of the strip mall and I don't think I had realized what amazing food was in store for us.    Since they make their bagels there, I decided nova lox cream cheese on a sesame bagel.  Little chunks of lox (AKA brine salmon) is blended into the cream cheese.  I could tell that the bagel was fresh.  Delightful!  $5.75 for this yummy goodness.  My hubby had the special fresh toast with a ton of fruit.  There was so much berries that he was able to have a bite of berries with every bit of fresh toast.  $8.99  Little one got a single pancake, but they baked chocolate chips into the pancake as well as topped it with chocolate chips.  She was in heaven.  This was the first time that she ate so much pancake that we didn't need a to go container.  Services was a little slow to start with, but once our servicer was at our table, he promptly checked up on us, food came out fast, and he was super friendly.  We will be back!  Yum!!",

    "text": "Not sure what the hype is... not being the biggest fan of traditional Jewish food, yet my hubby was craving an east coast Jewish style Rueben or similar sandwich, so we went.... standing at the door, seemingly invisible, we waited for at least 10 minutes as bussers and servers walked past. Finally, a busser offered us a booth, food scattered underfoot from the previous guest, we sat down.   The busser asked our drink orders, hot tea for me, water for my hubby. He returns a few minutes later, and a server comes over behind him. Friendly, but obviously hurried by her quick fire questions, we placed our orders. Not a lot for me with the style of food offered, I just got a grilled chicken sandwich, quite boring, I guess. Hubby ordered the Clary Silver, ginormous and enough for two or three people. Rye bread with pastrami, corned beef and cole slaw. He also ordered a potato latke with a side of applesauce. He said the Clary Silver was amazing, and finished it all. I tried the potato latke, salty and starchy, it's a potato pancake....  Personally, I'm just not a fan, but my hubby thought it was good. The place needs a good cleaning though in my opinion. He did mention the men's restroom was a bit messy.  Bill, minus tip, was $34 I believe.",

    "text": "Growing up in the Bronx, I was really excited to find what seemed to be a good Jewish restaurant out here, as that is something I haven't had the pleasure of enjoying in probably 20 years. Unfortunately, my excitement didn't last long, as my experience was more disappointing than impressive.   My wife and I went when they opened at 8 am, and seated ourselves as directed by the sign at the door. We were the first customers of the morning, so we picked a 2 seater towards the front. I don't usually really care too much about how a place looks, as long as it isn't dirty. This place looks like it was straight out of the lower east side of Manhattan, nothing fancy about it at all, or even pretending to be, with crooked pictures of their food and catering menus on the walls, walls which looked like they're still waiting for the paint job they needed back in 1977. Like I said though, I'm not too concerned with the place being fancy, as long as it's clean, and some of the best meals I've ever had were served in placed that looked like dumps, so that didn't really bother me, I'm just pointing it out to those who may be interested in the decor.  We were immediately approached by the bus boy who took our drink orders, 2 iced teas. He returned with our drinks a moment later and then came our server. My wife ordered \"the usual\", which is bacon, egg and cheese on a kaiser roll, and I got \"the killer\", which is pork roll, bacon, ham, egg and cheese, also on a kaiser roll. The food took probably 5 minutes to come out and was impressive at first glance, until I realized there was nothing on the plates of sandwiches but the sandwiches. My wife enjoyed her food, so I'll only speak on mine. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich itself was absolutely delicious, but for $11.95 I would have expected something more on the plate. Some potatoes? A slice of pickle? Hell, gimme a piece of lettuce or an orange slice as a garnish like the Black Bear diner does across the street. The bus boy refilled our drinks without being asked, which was nice, and then our server brought the bill: $25.63 (before the tip) for 2 sandwiches with no sides and 2 glasses of iced tea.  I'm not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, we eat breakfast out probably 4 mornings out of 5, but I do believe in at least getting what I pay for. This same bill at the Black Bear would have left us stuffed to the gills and more than satisfied, with friendly, attentive service. OK, whatever, time to pay and go. I pull out my card and put it into the little folder, and place it to the edge of the table - y'know, the international sign for \"please take this so I can go home and write my review.\" I wait. I wait some more. I wait even more. Now I'm getting annoyed. 34 minutes later, the server comes back to me and asks if we're OK, only because another customer came in and sat in her section. I said \"yeah, this was ready a half hour ago\" to which she replied \"oh, I didn't know.\" Well you would have known if you had bothered to come out from the back instead of hanging out bs'ing with the cooks. We ate right away and you brought the bill right away, how long did you think we wanted to sit there admiring the scenery?   Anyway, I gave the place 2 stars only because the food itself tasted delicious, but that's it. Credit where it's due, my sandwich was tasty and well put together, but absolutely not worth $12 by itself on a plate. Will I go back? No. I'll gladly spend the same amount of money across the street at the Black Bear, eat like I'm going to the electric chair, and not get put on the \"pay no mind\" list.",

I didn't know what to order and when the waitress was finally looking at me for my order, I panicked and got a burger.  Needless to say, I was given a hard time.  I knew that I was going against the grain when everyone else was ordering matza ball  soup and pastrami sandwiches.  But, to my defense, they had a burger on the menu, so I can only take half the responsibility.  The burger was okay, and knew I made a mistake as I was getting jealous of the soup.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will get the soup.    Service was alright and there wasn't an empty table in the place.  So, that speaks volumes.",

I've tried the baked goods and the deli food.  The hamantaschen, rugelach, and black & white cookies at Weiss are not very good. The filling in both the hamantaschen and rugelach seemed to rely more on a gel-like substance than fruit.  The cookies, a little stale.  Passable, but not something I would buy again.   The matzoh balls here also taste a little off...I really can't explain it. Rubbery?   Their corned beef, however, is decent as are the bagels.   But, Jewish deli is serious business.  Weiss just doesn't pull it off successfully.",

The chicken noodle soup is off the charts amazing and by far the best I've found in town. The staff from the 2 visits I've made so far all seem to be really great people. The experience in general is pretty cool. It's a bland looking simple restaurant when it comes to the decor but what they lack in decoration they definitely make up for in the food department. On a plus side it doesn't look like or feel like the cookie cutter restaurants that you walk into all over Las Vegas. It has a grandma and grandpa feel and that good ol home cooking grub. While I was waiting for my food I watched every plate come out of the kitchen and I honestly would've eaten any one of the items that I saw come out. Every dish looked scrumdiddlyumpcious! I highly recommend this place",

Also conducive to my niece making friends with the table next to us rather quickly.  Food Ups:  HUGE portions... and even that doesn't do it justice. You *will* have leftovers, and you will want them.  The brisket was amazing and tender and juicy and seasoned perfectly. The stuffed portabello was tender and meaty (texture) and fantastic and the spinach filling was fresh and just the right amount of bright and crisp. The corned beef reuben with homemade kraut was excellent. The chopped liver was so amazing I got some to go.  The chicken noodle soup was fabulous. Lots of chicken, veg, and flavor. Not overly salted and very, very well done. Home made and heartwarming, absolute bliss.  Food Downs:  The potato pancakes were too thick and just too large. Plate size, two of them came with the brisket and all but overpowered everything else. The FLAVOR was great... but I think we all wanted something a little smaller, maybe a little crisp?  The amount of cheese on the stuffed portabello could give even the healthiest patron a coronary. It detracted from the rest (see above) of the amazing dish. Cheese as a garnish, yay! As a gravy? Not so much.  A great meal, truly. Maybe a 3.5... but most of it was such an upside (with some of the amazing stuff to go!) that I had to round up. I will definitely be back for more.",

We just avoided siting in her area.  We had the occasion to sit where she was serving and she was cold to us.  We ignored it.  Today we went for breakfast where Jacques was our server.  He has always been courteous and friendly to us but acted as if we did something to him.  He brought our breakfast but it was 10 minutes and no toast or muffin.  My husband asked and he commented it was coming.  He walked away shaking his head.  I didn't say anything to my husband as I didn't want to ruin his breakfast but I told the manager.  No customer especially in a city in Las Vegas and Henderson where there are so many establishments have to see such behavior from their servers.  I no longer feel comfortable going there for breakfast and if we go there for lunch and either are our servers, I will not be inclined to put up with rolling eyes and shaking heads.",

I also put my clothes back on, my sick child, and took my 27.60 receipt with the food back to your establishment. When she looked in the bag , of course , it was wrong. She tried to give me the soup.  No apologies and the fact that I had to come out again to argue with your staff over a small cup of soup. I will not patronize a business that would treat a regular customer this way. Please refer to Yelp, my name is sweetnursecandy. Please look how many times I patronize your establishment. No I don't look like the regular people who frequent but please don't insult me. Denise was the worst encounter I have ever had out of the 30 plus times I have been to Weiss Deli. I asked for my money back. The moral of the story, don't stereotype me and you guys just lost a great customer. I will go where I'm appreciated.",

    "text": "We love this place! As a New Yorker, we're constantly struggling to find good traditional eats in Henderson and this place in one word is satisfying. Bagels, sandwiches, cookies all delicious. Wish we had tried it sooner. We are always so disappointed in what Henderson has to offer by way of take out or deli/diner experiences, so sometimes we put recommendations on the back burner. We have lived in Henderson for a little over two years and are just happy we are starting to try more things to weed out the bad. This place is great and even though it's not around the corner it's definitely worth it. There's really nothing great around the corner from Lake Las Vegas anyway and the \"village\" restaurants out by us are just not worth it even though they are less than 5 minutes from the house. If you like good food, you have to travel for it    It's just not something we are used to.",

The \"cup\" turned out to be a bowl AND that was the SMALL! I would imagine the BOWL is massive! The matzoh ball tasted 97% of what my mother used to make, and that's great!!  If that wasn't enough, I ordered a half of pastrami and chopped liver on rye, again, half a sandwich would be a whole sandwich anywhere else. Good pastrami as well as the chopped liver. The rye bread was excellent. Why did I wait almost a year to come here? Because Bagel Cafe is much closer. I decided to go beyond for a change....and it was a good decision!   And they have RICE PUDDING!!",

    "text": "I wish I'd gotten around to trying them sooner.  Weiss Restaurant Deli & Bakery is nestled in the Trader Joe's plaza on Green Valley and Sunset, and they're practically just around the corner from school and home. I sure took my sweet time getting around to trying them though. I don't recall whether anyone ever invited me here, but I finally invited myself today after deciding that I wanted lunch before grabbing some coffee.  The decor is a bit more reminiscent of cubicles than a diner or family restaurant, but the crowd was there for Saturday afternoon and the menu definitely does the trick. It's a Jewish deli type of place with some breakfast specials, burgers, and a huge variety of sandwiches. I took a long hard look at the menu, mainly because my server disappeared for a while after giving me \"a minute,\" but eventually I went straight for some of the classics.  First item to arrive (and very quickly) was the standalone small bowl of chicken soup w/ matzoh ball ($5.95). It's a classic take on soup with a few veggies. There's definitely more chicken than you'd expect, but it's a carb lover's treat otherwise. Thin noodles draped the bowl and the matzoh ball, which is a big fluffy dumpling that I'm sure reminds some people of home cooking. Oh, and the thin bread croutons on the plate did provide a hard crunch that was welcome. It was a good start to the meat.  The pastrami sandwich ($13.95 full size) came out soon afterward. This is the kind of sandwich that I'm sure other places try to emulate (and most often fail). Two healthy slices of rye (my slice) held together a huge mound of thinly sliced, juicy, tender meat. It was bite after bite of savory, spiced goodness that didn't require anything else - not even cheese or mustard. I didn't even find myself sucking up water afterward, which is a sign that nothing I had was a salt bomb.  The included-with-sandwich potato salad was a slightly sweet, well-executed side that's otherwise standard deli fare. Although it didn't help me that much, I'm not sure that the other options (cole slaw, fries, fruit) would've been direct complements either.  I've gotta add Weiss to my rotation and try their other stuff. Overstuffed sandwiches, burgers, and breakfast all seem like enticing comfort foods that could make me really happy under the right circumstances. It might seem just a tad pricey, but this is a great neighborhood deli that all Henderson folks should try if they haven't.",

It is mild but flavorful.  Portions are huge, so very convenient for sharing. If you get a chance - snag a seat in Jaque's section.  Now to the down sides (ergo 3 stars). The service in this place (Jaque notwithstanding) is absolutely atrocious. First - the hosting is incredibly disorganized, so at busy times, 20-30 people get cramped into a space designed for maybe 10 people and then try to flag down the \"hostess\" to get on a waiting list. Second - the wait staff is very inattentive and oftentimes looks downright annoyed when you flag them to take your order or refill coffee. Food is slow to arrive and sometimes arrives cold. Also - although there are typically 7-8 people on the floor, none of them seem to be doing anything related to serving customers.  I would still recommend this place because the food is that amazing. Just zero out your expectation of service and enjoy your meal.",

I've also gotten the tuna melt here and it's excellent, but I would recommend getting it closed rather than open-faced- it's messy (but worth it). Excellent, crispy fries, and delicious matzoh ball soup. Just don't try to come here if you're in a rush. The service is just fine, but it's not in-and-out-in-half-an-hour kind of service.

    "text": "I used yelp to find a breakfast place by the Galaxy Green Valley Theater. This is where the hubs and I ended up and we've been here 3 times since.  I LOVE Jewish delis. It reminds me of my NY NJ days. Good homecooking, and just quality food in jiffy.  The restaurant in nestled in a old shopping strip mall. The deli\\bakery has it's own entrance and the restaurant has booths and tables both inside and outside. As far as decor goes - it's definitely minimalist central but I did appreciate the local artwork they had up. We got their just after they opened and they already have 6 or seven other tables with people. The place obviously has lots of regulars because I heard a few waiters say - \"Your usual Mr. So and So\". Always a good sign.  I had their \"the usual\" breakfast sandwich and despite the warm day we were having, I had a bowl of Matzo ball soup. Everything was just the way I wanted it.  My husband got \"the killer\" breakfast sandwich and pancakes. He gobbled it all up. The bagels that the sandwiches came on were so fresh. My soup was flavorful and there was plenty of it. Despite my best efforts, I could not finish it :(  The second third and fourth time I've been here, I had the same breakfast sandwich and a side of corn beef hash. I enjoyed every bite. We brought another couple along, one of whom is a vegetarian. She had ordered the vegetable hash and could not stop saying how great it was. My husband ventured out and had their french toast which he told me was to die for. I knew it was because it was made on challah bread. I had a bite of it and it really was amazing.  The waiter we had the first 3x was Jacques, he was the perfect waiter. He remembered us when he waited on us the second time and just really added to the great experience we had. I didn't catch the waitress's name that was there for us on visit #4 but she was as sweet as could be.  All in all, from start to finish, we thoroughly enjoyed this place and have already began the tradition of coming here for Sunday breakfast and driving down a block to catch a movie.  If you are looking for a great breakfast\\brunch spot, make sure to add this to your list of places you must try.",

    "text": "Being a big fan of bagel cafe, I wanted to find a similar place to eat that was a bit closer and easier to get to. Luckily, I found Weiss.    Man oh man, this place has some dang good chicken noodle and matzo ball soup ! Broth is super flavorful, chicken is nice and tender. Basically, it's just piping hot amazingness in your mouth. Their food portions here are big enough, that I probably don't need to get the soup everything I go, but you can be damn sure I will. Especially now that it's getting colder, no way am I going to pass up the soup when I eat here.   Along with my soup, I usually get Ceilys stack. It's two potato latkes stuffed with brisket, and then covered with melted provolone and Munster cheese, as well as their brown sauce (gravy). I actually prefer to get mine with the gravy on the side. It's so rich and a little bit too salty for me to want it slathered all over. Instead, I prefer it on the side so I can just put small amounts on here and there. Also, just as a side note, Yates great even as left overs. I can never finish the soup and the stack, so I usually take half of the stack home, and it's still just as good. Meat, cheese, and potatoes... how can you go wrong ?   As fire the service, I've gotten mixed feelings about it. I had Jacques add my server in the morning, and he was great. He was super busy with the tables, but still checked in on us and was very friendly. At night, I had Margie. While she wasn't unpleasant, she wasn't very pleasant either. We were also only one of three tables at the time, and the service wasn't that great. Other than that, all has been good.   Now, if I haven't reiterated it enough... go get some matzo ball soup !",

    "text": "One visit so far, but will be back.  I had the Ceily's stack (brisket, potato pancakes, cheese, topped with brown gravy) and matzo ball soup.  The Mrs. had a Reuben.  We shared, of course.  Huge portions.  Chicken matzo ball soup is perfection.  Reuben was as good as it gets . . . and HUGE with plenty of meat.   Lots of made-from-scratch stuff.  It's the real deal.  From what we observed at other tables and ate ourselves, it's quality food with generous portions.  Large menu with a lot of choices.  Great take-out and to-go counter, including chopped liver, kippered salmon, rice pudding, bagels, and pastries.  Killer garlic bagels that simply reek of garlic!  This joint took me back to my East Coast Jewish roots.    Only complaint was the coffee tasted like instant, and no non-dairy creamer was available.  I would have deducted 1/2 a star for this if possible, but will let it slide for now. Given how many of us Jew-folk are lactose intolerant, you'd think they'd have non-dairy creamer available.  I'd happily pay a little more for the coffee in order to get good coffee and Coffee-Mate with my breakfast.  Service was just fine and reasonably attentive.  Waitstaff was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  No complaints there at all.  Hopefully future visits will be as good.  Looking forward to \"testing\" the benedicts.",

    "text": "I stopped in here finally after going to Trader Joe's like a thousand times right next to it. It was just me and I wanted something new for breakfast. I heard rave things from people so I figured why not? When I go places, often times I try to get what is their specialty. So I asked my super nice server and without hesitation was told the benedicts. After about 2 seconds of deliberation I was sold on the Black Mountain Benny. I figured this would make or break this place. 1- this entree has brisket, which I am CRAZY picky about. 2- hollandaise sauce....I make my own, and have rarely found restaurants that even make tolerable hollandaise. Double whammy of possible major letdown.   Letdown, I was not. The reason I am picky about my brisket it fat globs. Umm yuck. This was glob free and must have hit the pan for a bit with the onions because it has a caramelized taste to it. Yum. Hollandaise, was good. NOT as good as my own (I like a tad bit of lemony tang) but MUCH MUCH MUCH better than anywhere I have found thus far. It was real. Not mix that tastes like chicken broth with a flavorless mayo base.   Is this a fancy place? NOPE. Is it delicious? YEP. Will I be back for more? HELLS YES.   Fantastic service. good food. and next to Trader Joes...what more could you want?",

As if that wasn't enough I couldn't stop there I had to try the Reuben. Wow, it was excellent, would have to be up there with Carnegie's in NYC.

I was surprised by the amount of seating space inside, It's diner style and has lots of small business charm.  I was hoping to pick up some pastries while there too but none of them appealed to me.

Everything seems homemade and they have huge servings.  I have had the corned beef hash and it is the best in Vegas.  I get the everything bagel with breakfast.  It is toasty on the outside and has a nice chewiness with tons of flavor.  I have also had the Matzo ball soup.  It is so good - full of that umami essence.  The Half-sour pickles are my favorite, I have been looking for a place that has those pickles for years!  The place also base a deli counter to buy salads, bagels, pastries - stuff like that.  Do yourself a favor and go here.",

My Mom has raved about this place for years, and I was finally able to join her for lunch, hungry and excited to try the food. The matzoh ball soup was delicious, and the cup is actually a bowl. The half rueben sandwich was also delicious, even though I took it home after filling up on the soup. But the service... oh my...I've never been treated so rudely, EVER!! Our server seemed put out at every question we asked him, I was getting more and more uncomfortable at each snarky response he blurted out. I then asked him for a new fork because I accidentally dropped mine on the floor. I didn't think he heard me and repeated that I dropped it. He said he heard me the first time, and plopped the fork on the table. I then told him he needed to chill out, and he said \"I don't know what you're talking about...shut up and eat your food!\" I was dumbfounded, truly. He obviously knew he was out of hand, because he never came back to our table and sent other servers to help us and bring the check. We asked to speak to the manager, but were told that she just left for the day. I will try one more time, only because a good deli is hard to come by, but I sure hope the service improves.",

Upon picking it up, the woman did not provide me a bag to carry the two boxes, said nothing, and just walked off without acknowledgement. So I carried my boxes out and home.  She also did not pack me syrup or butter for my pancakes.  I returned to the store with my now cold pancakes.    The woman had the pancakes reheated up, against my wishes of new pancakes, provided me with butter and syrup.   The syrup is from Kraft and fake, the butter is not real butter, and the pancakes tasted fake (likely Kraft as well).   I had expected local and fresh ingredients to be placed in my food, such as local or regionally sourced real syrup, fresh butter, and homemade pancakes.  Did not finish my pancakes, and will likely not be returning.",

They are made with onions and really add flavor.  The sandwich can be difficult to eat, but get after it with a knife and fork and you will be in good shape.  For lunch, my usual is the Reuben.  This sandwich is LARGE, easily 2 meals.  Loaded with cheese and sauerkraut, it's the perfect amount of each ingredient.  I recommend heating it up in a toaster oven or regular oven, rather than a microwave.  It kept the bread crunchy.  My wife likes the chicken noodle soup, which uses angel hair type noodles and lots of herb, particularly dill.  Highly recommended.  We usually get some bagels to go to make sandwiches at home.  Fantastic everything bagels!  They also sell all of their meats by the pound, as well as many other items.  They make their own corned beef and pastrami, and it shows.",

Decent amount of seating with mostly 4 tops and a few 2 tops. We were seated right away and our server was right with us for drink orders.

She even eyerolled to her co-worker who shouted at her. (Watching this alone is cringey).  I get it, they're busy and I'm sorry for her that her co-worker pressures her. Can they process order according to who ordered first (and already paid) and not based on who has the loudest voice?  Tried to be as calm as possible and not to add pressure to the cashier but I had to go since I have limited lunch break. Ended up not getting the soup coz she might process new orders again if new people come in before grabbing my soup at the back. Got potato salad instead.

Piled so high with lettuce but barely any bacon. Potato salad was excellent though.   I was really looking forward to the bakery but it was extremely lacking. I got a variety and every single one tasted like a grocery store bought cookie. I still have a slice of cheesecake I haven't tasted, but I'm not feeling optimistic.",

This was the most bland meal I've ever had in my entire life. There was no flavor whatsoever to any of the food except for the potato salad and it was mediocre. Super disappointed and will never eat here again.",

I met a friend for lunch today and we each ordered a 1/2 corned beef sandwich, the matzo ball soup, and an order of two potato latkes so we each could have one.  The soup was very good and I made the comment that it was the only soup that I didn't have to salt.  It wasn't salty to me, but I tasted it and knew I didn't need more--an unusual circumstance.  As we were finishing our soup, the sandwiches were brought and they had a good amount of meat.  I got rye.  Then the potato latkes came and the waitress split the order and placed a latke on each of our sandwich plates because the tables are so small and very close together.  Service was good although I never was asked if I wanted an iced tea refill.    The best part of the meal was the soup.  I don't have to go so far to get good soup.  Weiss is OK.",

I had to try the chicken noodle soup with the matzoh ball and it was really satisfying. The soup had good flavor and the ball was not too dense. To accompany that, I had a scoop of whitefish salad which was delicately smoked and not overly full of mayo which was nice. My dining companion had the classic (roast turkey) club, to which he gave a thumbs up. The club came with a generous serving of fries- not too soggy, not overly done so it was good. I'll come back if I'm in the area and I want to try the bakery selection.",

Admitting up front that I'm neither Jewish nor particularly fond of smoked fish and thus leaving judgments of authenticity or the quality of their Lox at the door, it was just short of 8:15am when I entered the deceptively large space and with a young Hispanic gentleman shouting 'sit anywhere you want' I did just that, a quick perusal of the deli and bakery confirming some selections for later before sitting down to a menu already in place.  Declining potted coffee in favor of water as I was already quite awake from my early morning run I was soon informed that the daily-special French Toast with apples and walnuts would not be ready until an indefinable 'later' and equally denied a single buttermilk biscuit side-order because \"they come in threes\" I instead stuck to the menu, my three part order beginning with a nicely toasted bagel featuring great chew and plenty of plump raisins.  Moving next to a two-part pile of pancakes alongside housemade challah griddled golden brown and eschewing Kraft 'pancake syrup' in place of maple brought from home it was surprisingly the fluffy flapjacks teaming with buttermilk that outshined French toast not particularly well penetrated by custard and settling the bill quickly for a Jackson inclusive of tax and tip I quickly stepped next door, another $10 paid to a smiley young woman for three items consumed over the next couple hours while enjoying college football and coffee in a nearby lounge - the brownie a touch artificial with mouthfeel compromised by paraffin while the Frisbee sized Black & White was pillowy soft and the re-warmed block of bread pudding presented everything the French Toast did not, each bite soft with custard and equally eggy as it was sweet.  Equal to Carnegie Deli at half the price but only outshining Bagel Cafe / Del Mar Deli in the Bread Pudding and Black & White I'd gladly stop by Weiss in the future to check out some more of their baked goods or perhaps a sandwich and soup, but given the nearly 30 minute drive from my home in Summerlin I'll probably revisit Bagel Cafe first and recommend others do so as well - the selection, quality, and value all combining to put it a few steps above the rest...enough so that even if I lived in Henderson I'd make the drive northwest.",

Came here on a Sunday morning after the morning rush, shortly after 10, and we sat outside as the weather was nice. Food was still decent, I ordered an omelette with a bagel on the side and the bf had French toast. The French toast was huge! The food was good, typical breakfast food.   The service, however, was horrendous. The couple sitting at the next table, who came before us, remained seated for awhile without menus and it took another 5 minutes before someone realized so and brought them menu and served them.   No one checked on us during the meal, and when someone finally did when we were almost finished with the meal, we asked for another glass of orange juice. It took literally another 5 minutes before he came back, this time, with a wine glass of orange juice as he said they ran out of glasses.   After we were done with our meal and we were ready to pay, we put the card out ready to be paid. We finally asked the waitress to take it when she came to the table, and she asked, \"take what?\" Really? It just gets irritating when you have to ask for literally everything, every time, including a box.   The wait staff was mostly high school kids or at least they looked like it, so I guess we shouldn't be surprised. BUT since it's supposed to be a family own mom and pop place, actually I was pretty surprised. Would never return again unless it's for takeout!!!",

Open faced Reuben is a fantastic meal sure to promise a full second meal's worth of leftovers, although it's not a perfect \"Reuben\" sandwich per say. I've never been a huge fan of eating chicken salad sandwich's from restaurants, but their's is outright amazing and is in my usual rotation. Matzah ball chicken noodle soup is always the highlight of the meal for me, and I always get an order to go whenever I start to feel sick; it's the closest thing to \"mom's\" you'll ever get. For breakfast, it's always hard for me to try anything other than the \"Ceily's Stack\", it's savory breakfast heaven with massive latkes and meat covered in cheese and gravy.  Has a nice family diner atmosphere, and service is definitely focused on efficiently turning customers over quickly; which feels nice when your from the Midwest or East Coast like I am. Get in, be smiled at, eat, get a refill, finish eating, and then leave. The way it should be; no lollygagging around with laptops out or any of that nonsense.",

When I've come for lunch I've ordered half a sandwich and soup - the portions are huge! It's a great value. The waiter always seems to recommend Challah bread, so that is what I've gotten and it has been really good. Also, I had some sort of brisket eggs benedict - again, the portions are huge, I think I took almost half of it home. And the brisket was very tasty and tender - exactly what you'd expect from a delicatessen.   The downside is that there can be a wait and they don't seem to keep a list. You just have to stand around at the door until they get to you. And people aren't really standing in a straight line because there is limited space. It would make things much easier if they just took down names and let people wait outside. (I guess you could always order your food at the take out counter.)  Speaking of outside, when the weather is nice they serve at the outdoor tables too. So this place is dog friendly! Just beware, you still have to wait your turn in that line to get an outdoor table.",

HUGE portions - real corned beef, pastrami, tongue - yeah, I said tongue. (Center cut like you can hardly find as good in NYC.) Bagels, nova, chopped chicken liver, latkes, matzo ball and chicken soups like mom's and it cures whatever ails you just the same. Gefilte fish, white fish salad, cheesecake the most die-hard New Yorkers kill for, even service that reminds you of what being in a New York deli feels like. Pickles on the table, knishes, kreplach, rugalah, black and white cookies everything a New Yorker could want or wish for in a deli - except real New York rye bread. The bread has caraway seeds, but is much thicker and lacks the \"New York\" rye bread taste. OK, so you can't have everything, but this is irksome just the same.   Take home a \"doggie bag\" and/or stop by their take out counter and bring more of the deliciousness home with you.",

Finally got some time to meet up with Elite Emily, so we chose this place because who doesn't love some good pastrami? Terrorists, that's who. We, however, are not terrorists, so we went to check out this place in Henderson.  The main downside is that it's small. Like, \"get there early or prepare to wait\" small. Our wait time wasn't too bad, but with the cramped seating, I can see it filling up very quickly and not relenting. Also, even in our early [CENSORED] we definitely skewed the age range downward.  Suck it up, Soldier Sassypants, because this is some serious deli pwnge, Elite Emily went with the Soup & Sandwich combo, but the Matzo Ball Soup dominated so that way when she got to the sandwich, it was almost time to throw in the towel. My Pastrami Burger was so big I'm fairly sure you could have put little french fry legs and made it into a scene-stealing Disney sidekick. But it was delicious though, so it wouldn't have lasted long. Because I would have eaten it. And possibly burped. TMI.  The meat was done just right, with just the right seasonings to go with it, and the pastrami was shaved so thin while still being piled high and tender. Add a little deli mustard, oy, it's like buttah. You'll develop shpilkis in your genechtagazoink.  Service was friendly, if a little rushed (I mean, granted, we were thirsty, but ya didn't have to bring the whole pitcher of Pepsi over). Definitely a hidden gem worth finding.

It's a little on the pricey side for the area, but absolutely worth it. I was shocked to find a superior Jewish deli compared to anything I experience in LA or SF -- one that would hold its own in NY.  The only mildly disappointing item I've had was the lattke. It wasn't bad at all, but not the way I like potato pancakes. I prefer to have a little bit of crispiness.  Now that that's out of the way, everything else I've had at the restaurant was spectacular -- reuben, matzo ball soup, knish, bagel with lox and cream cheese, and the black and white cookie were all phenomenal. There are so many excellent choices on the menu that it's tough to choose.  Weiss is a great Jewish deli and I'll definitely be going back for more.",

Then 5 minutes later a third seating. Still no one came to take our order. The server then went to the people seated third and took their orders. The people next to me started complaing. Then a fourth table was seated and the server went to these people that were seated last and took their order. Mind you now, we are waiting 15 minutes with no one taking our order and we were first. I get up to tell the server and she annoyed says I will be right over. She continues to take the last seatings order and disappears into the kitchen. A few moments later, the owners wife and manager comes over to take our order. I tell her what just happened and  as usual dealing with here, no apology a, and says, well I am here now.   I have a friend I turned onto this place. He says he will never go again. Says every time he goes in, its server chaos. Get this. People that came in BEFORE me, I hear them complaining about getting their orders taken, and the waiter says 'Can't you see how busy we are'!!!   One time I went in the take out section. The Open light was on outside, there were a few people ahead of me. The owners wife refused to serve me, said sorry we are closed. At the time they closed at 4pm, I entered about 3:58. I am on the line maybe 3 minutes and the owners wife says sorry we are closed. I say I walked in before 4pm, the door was open and the open sign on. She refused to serve me. She has seen me in there many times before. If you people giving these great reviews can overlook the horrible service and a nasty owner/manager with zero people skills. Have at it.      They are lucky they are the only game in town. If a Deli of comparable food opens up in a 1/4 mile radius, Weiss will be Finished. I drive from the north west to frequent this business and to say they have no appreciation for their customers would ne an understatement. I am 66 yrs old and this is the first time in my life I refused to leave atip. I am a tip earner, and always tip. Even when the service is bad. I always think, oh well, maybe they are just having a bad day.  This lousy service and nasty unapologetic attitude filters down from the owner herself. Will not be back.",

    "text": "I've only been here once, but I will definitely go back. It was a while back but I had been searching the area for something  more in the lines of comfort foods. After googling and searching yelp, I read a few reviews and looked over their menu. It sounded like it was close to what I was looking for so I  headed over after work.   Food - I got an open face roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy, as well as, some chicken noodle soup. The soup was pretty good, but the best part was the HUGE plate of roast beef and mashed potatoes. They were the warm, yummy comforting food I was in a search for that day. I totally left happy.   Service - It was just a touch slow but the kid was pretty friendly and brought things out in a fairly quick manner. The only reason it was slow was that he was the ONLY person there and there were quite a few tables. I tried to be patient as I've been there and it kinda is hard.  I know this is a jewish deli so I totally need to go in for bagels one day, but I haven't had the time or thought. It's hard to find a place in the city with any semblance of comfort food so this place is a good alternative when I'm wanting mashed potatoes and warm yummy goodness. It's not the plate lunch places of the South, but it's a good substitution.",

The service was friendly and prompt and we all got exactly what we ordered and it was all at a fair price. The total check for 4 people came out to $46 with tax, but not including tip, which isn't that high for the huge portions we were getting.

Afterwards go to Ethel M if you're interested since it's only another 5-10min drive away.  It's an old style restaurant that's pretty popular now since Chowhounds mentions they have the best bagel outside NY in Vegas.  B. didn't like the booth sinks too deep he said, so we got a 4-top table.  I got: Poppy seed bagel w/ cream cheese $2.75.  I wanted sesame but they ran out.  I asked for it toasted & it was.  Cream cheese was on the side.  B. got regular bagel w/ lox & cream cheese $5.25.  That's cream cheese w/ pieces of lox mixed in.  I liked it better.  2 scrambled eggs $1.75 - we shared, fine.   Corned beef hash $4.95 - housemade.  I liked it, but found it salty.  OJ $2.25 - not freshly squeezed, B. got it.  Coffee $1.95 - they refill it free.  Our total $18.90 + $1.53 tax = $20.43 before tip.  Separate bathrooms available.  Credit cards allowed.  They have a little deli section & bakery too.  Didn't buy anything there.",

We showed up at noon on Sunday expecting to order a sandwich at a counter and look around at all the wonderful dessert items. Instead, we were instantly in the middle of a busy restaurant that offers a big selection of breakfast and lunch options. I don't think I have ever taken so long to decide on what to order. I chose the half order roast beef sandwich on a soft roll with a side of fries. Easily the best roast beef sandwich I have ever eaten! It was piled high with plenty of mayo, mustard, lettuce ,and tomatoes. The french fries were run of the mill and could have used more seasoning. Better yet- throw some gravy on those fries. I am so glad I ordered the half sandwich-- it was plenty! My wife ordered the half order brisket sandwich with a bowl of chicken soup that we heard so much about. The soup itself was good, but had a dill flavor that was overpowering in my opinion. On the other hand, the brisket was tender and delicious.   Our bill was a little over $20.00, and the service was great! Considering this place is a bakery, I was disappointed in the baked goods available for sale at the counter. I saw a few cookies, but was hoping to find an eclair, pastry, or cake to try out.    I am giving this place a solid 4 star rating for the sandwiches, portions, and service. I will definitely be back to sample their breakfast menu.",

Weiss is a full scale Jewish deli, in a city where so many are overpriced and underwhelming.   You can get everything from BAGELS, lox and cream cheese, to live and onions. Their sandwiches are piled high, and asking for things like Russian Dressing do not add $1.50 to the bill.   My favorite thing on the menu is not anything any other deli has, and I promise if you try it, just make sure you share, is something you will not soon forget! It's called the Cecily's Stack and it is brisket piled on potato latkas, top with melted cheese and smothered in gravy all served with a dollop of sour cream! It is simply amazing, the perfect comfort food, and one can never have too much of that!  My only complaint with Weiss' is that it is so far from my side of town, I desperately wish they would put one over here, hint hint!",

The Hash Stack is one of the best things I've ever eaten! The bagels are the best I've had outside of NY, and the sandwiches are massive. I almost always take half home for dinner.",

The outside dining area is a great place to enjoy breakfast!   My only complaint: The weekends can get busy, especially in the morning at which point the service isn't as good.",

I like the Carnegie Deli on the strip but I wanted to try this place which was closer to home. The waitstaff was very hurried, at least the young man who waited on us was.   It took a while to get service once we were seated.  He was brusque and was not helpful.  When I asked about a different type of bread for my pastrami  corned beef sandwich he just said \"it has to be on rye, nothing else will hold it.\" He did not come back to the table to ask if everything was ok.  I just felt rushed. The pastrami corned beef sandwich was good and big.  I had plenty to take home with me.  My friend said the matso ball soup was good. I would probably go back and hope for a better, less rushed experience.",

Got nervous when we walked in and the place was empty (think it was around 3pm on a thurs) anyway decided to trust the good reviews and sat down to order. We both decided on a half sandwich and matzo ball soup combo. 8.95 for combo and 1.50 extra for matzo ball soup as opposed to the soup du jour. Holy shit! The portions were ginormous! The soup which I thought would be a cup was a big bowl served  with bagel chips. The waiter reassured me this was the smaller size. Heh. The half sandwich was enough for 2 people! I had pastrami and he had corned beef. Both were piled a foot high between the biggest half slice of rye I have ever seen. Pastrami was sliced paper thin( just the way I like it) and soooo juicy and delish!  I didn't try the hubby's corned beef but he enjoyed it very much. Would definitely go on a reg basis if it was a little closer. Next time could easily share unless you want to take home leftovers.",

It's a pleasure to eat in a place that understands a big appetite and quality food in a town where we have a huge variety, but a lacking in overall quality. I wrote a review a while back when I was on a strict diet that had me very edgy and came in upset already on my cheat day and let ONE problem I had (out of 100+ positives I've had) lead me to write a review that IN NO WAY is a representation of how I feel about this place, and for that I feel bad. so I wanted to correct that snap judgement I made sitting there that day by re-writing my review. The only other thing I can do to fix this error in judgement on my part is something I already do, which is continue coming back to eat here whenever in the neighborhood and continuing to recommend this restaurant to anyone I know who wants to eat a great meal from a small business that in my opinion a lot of restaurant owners should take notes from and apply to their own restaurant businesses locally.",

I used a little Dijon mustard on the corned beef but the pastrami didn't need anything. Both sandwiches had plenty of meat and tasted great. I never had matzo ball soup and I don't know what it was supposed to taste like. It tasted like regular chicken soup with a large dumpling in it. Nothing too special about it.",

Made me feel like I was in Munich and waited for her to start singing Marlena Dietrich songs and bring out big mugs of Hefeweizen... if you like chopped liver and all the other salads and goodies in the deli case, they have everything on the menu to go.  Sharon had a cranky old lady that wanted the dressing mixed in her salad not on top so she hollered to the kitchen, \"Can someone toss my salad??\" I swear my drink shot out my nose and kitchen staff laughed till they hit the floor.  So much for Germans knowing American slang. So it's a joke now to ask \"how's your tossed salad?\" She will blush.  This deli is a great break from the strip delis and better quality and prices may seem high at first glance but if you see the size of sandwiches, you'll think they are training meals for 600 lb life. I actually got a couple meals and a snack. Don't miss the deserts they are great and Sharon knows the menu and can recommend good choices to fit your taste. Yea it's not on the strip but not all great food and service is on the strip. Sunday brunch could easily become a tradition. Anything on menu can be packed to go. Give it a shot if you like old school excellent deli nosh.",

    "text": "Weiss Deli has been on my radar for some time so I decided to do lunch yesterday. I have to say, I am a little disappointed. Mostly because what I really had a craving for I did not see on their menu. But that did not stop me from enjoying what I was able to order.  I ordered a half pastrami sandwich on rye with a cup of chicken noodle soup. I would have like kreplach soup but I didnt see that so I added a matzoh ball instead. I also ordered a potato knish because I had never tried that before.  The soup came out quickly. It was very good. A fair amount of shredded chicken. Both light and dark meat. Some carrots and celery. Lots of long skinny noodles. And a big ass matzoh ball. To echo Norm K, it did not need salt. It had plenty of it already. I cant say for sure if the broth was fresh or from a concentrate. I lean towards the latter. Either way it was a good soup. Very satisfying even on a warm day.  My sandwich came out next. Two thin pieces of rye bread with tender pastrami piled high. A squirt of mustard and it was on. A good sandwich but hard to eat. The bread was not sturdy enough to hold up to the meat. Taste trumps cosmetics so I can look beyond that. The pickle on the side was lack luster. Not very briney. More like a fresh cucumber. It was refreshing but I like a good sour pickle.  I dont know why I ordered so much food. I wasnt even that hungry. But I still had my knish to go. It came to the table hot. Very hot. It was fried golden brown. I wish I could say it was crispy with the fry job but it was kind of a tough skin on the outside. It was hard to cut through without the potato filling squeezing out everywhere. When it came to taste, though, amazing. The only thing that would have made it better to me would be a side of sour cream and chives.   Service was fine. My drink was refilled a few times. My food came out fast and hot. All good things vibes there. But they dont seem to have the kreplach nor cabbage rolls I was craving. And I dont like being told to seat myself. That just confuses me and makes me worried that I'll be overlooked. That is not so much a complaint as it is a reflection of my own insecurity. This was an otherwise solid experience.",

Today, the waiter was prompt to my table, and before I could even utter, \"L'Shana Tovah!\", the Matzoh Ball soup I ordered was there at the table, literally within 90 seconds!  Very good soup, excellent quality.  I then ordered \"The Dip\" which was this piled high beef sandwich with excellent beef and au jus sauce.  It was devine.  The French fries were hot and crispy and the pickled items on the plate were very tasty.  The only thing that was a bit off-putting - but not so much to me, as I drop F-bombs daily, the way some health nuts pop dietary daily supplements, was the staff were dropping some F-bombs and a variety of sh*ts peppered their conversations with each other, combined with how loud their conversations were (and I was on the other side of the wall) seemed a bit unprofessional, but hey, the food was that good that I didn't mind.    My waiter was Joquez (sorry about the spelling), and he was really nice, \"yes, m'amming\" it up, and even shook my hand before I left.    The bill from a small chicken/matzoh ball soup, a Coke and \"The Dip\" sandwich came to $24.  Not bad, especially since I have leftovers!",

    "text": "Woohoo! As good as it gets!....this is what Yelp has for 5 star reviews and I can say without a doubt that Weiss Deli is still as good as it gets all these years later. Actually, I probably like it more now than I did when I reviewed it back in 2014. My pallet has become quite a bit more sophisticated. The fact that in my last review I ordered a cinnamon raisin bagel just makes me shake my head.   So my go-to breakfast item is the MOTHER OF ALL HASH. Traditional corned beef hash that is so good that even my son, who has all of 19 months of lifes experience, loves it. In fact, he loves EVERYTHING here. He even eats the Eggs Nova Scotia that my wife regularly orders which includes salmon and capers. He eats like it's the last supper at Weiss, it's incredible. Much like his pappy he also loves the matzoh ball soup. It's dynamite. Sometimes we'll get a to-go order of matzoh ball soup, two everything or onion bagels, then a load of their chive cream cheese, which is life changing.   Back to the hash. It's crispy and savory. The poached eggs are always, always, always cooked to perfection. Once in a while the bagels will be a tad overcooked, even then they are amazing. Still my favorite bagel I've ever had. That chive cream cheese, if you are a fan of onion, is an absolute must. The flavor infused in there is just incredible, and they always give you a generous amount. There is a $.95 upgrade for it, but it's money very well spent.   Their service is also incredible too. Very nice servers, the bussers are incredibly attentive and I've never have issues getting refills of coffee or iced tea. They even bring out fruit early for my little man knowing that kids often get fussy when they don't have food 37 seconds after they sit down. The thoughtfulness is always very much appreciated.   If there is one place you visit for breakfast in this city I'd make this the place, it's that good. Waits are never that bad either for as busy as it is. After typing this review I feel like a need to go back to Weiss for lunch.",

As we sat waiting, more patrons came in and another employee came by to take their names.  We informed him that we were there first, but the other girl did not put us down.  When he was ready to seat us, he pointed to a table for us to sit at and proceeded to sit the couple after us in the available booth.  That was their first offense.  Then he asks the couple in the booth for their drink order and never came back to us.  We had to wait for another busboy to see that we were sat and to take our drink order.  Second offense.  Then the server proceeds to go to the booth first and take their order at least 5 minutes before heading over to greet us.  Third offense.  The booth got their food first...& continues to get the best service while we were neglected.  The server went up to their booth numerous times to check on them them and get them refills.  We had to flag someone down to get refills...& instead of iced tea I had coke poured into my glass.  Fourth offense!  Watching all of the busboys/servers attend to all the other tables around us and never come up to us made us feel like we had done something wrong.  All we did was politely inform the guy that we had arrived first!  The most attention we received from the waiter was he quickly dropped off the bill and only then did he ask how we were doing.  Really poor excuse for service!  Food was just okay, too!  First and last time there!",

The place was PACKED! With Jewish people! SCORE!!  Warning, their sandwiches are huge. Go for the 1/2 size unless you're really hungry or have a fridge at home.

    "text": "I finally ventured to Weiss for lunch with my friend. I have heard talk of this place for ages, so was excited to try what they had to offer. Since everyone seems to always rave about their chicken noodle soup, so I knew I had to give that a chance. I decided on the half sandwich and soup, to maximize the amount of things I could try. I'm not typically a big fan of deli meat, but still went with the corned beef.   The soup came out quickly and was enormous. Lots of meaty pieces of chicken and a huge matzo ball in the center. The matzo ball was perfection, I'm usually easy to please with these. The soup was a little under-seasoned for my taste, so I had to add some salt and pepper. I rarely ever have to add salt to anything, so this was very, very rare for me. The soup was very filling and by the time my sandwich came out I was stuffed. I ate about half my half sandwich, which was enormous as well and packaged the rest to go with me. My friend ordered the pastrami burger with fries. It was huge and looked really good and meaty. The patrons at the next table were impressed as well and kept asking him about his order and if it tasted as good as it looked, to which he answered \"yes.\" My sandwich was good and I enjoyed it for the mots part. The bread was a little dry, but adding mustard really enhanced the flavor. I would be curious about their clubs or reubens next time as those looked tasty, as well as their breakfast items.   Service was friendly, but they were short with us and we felt a bit rushed. After our second drink refill, the server left the pitcher on our table without a word, making us feel like we were bothering him a bit. Our other server was efficient, but not very chatty and didn't make much effort beyond what was expected.   For the most part, we had a decent meal and I'd be curious to check them out again and try some more items from their very extensive menu.",

    "text": "Jewish deli! Yes, please! I love this place! This is a hard one for me to write because I love everything from here! You can't go wrong with anything you order. I often stop in and order from their take out counter. My standard order is 1lb of potato salad and 3 of their half done pickles! Mmmmmm so so good! I've also gotten their rye bagel and a loaf of their rye bread. The taste is so good you will never want to buy store brand bread again. The White Fish Salad and the Baked Salmon Salad are super creamy and just has that fishy taste I want.   As far as sitting down and ordering a sandwich, which you can also order to go , there are many choices. The standard Pastrami on Rye is loaded with meat, more then enough for two meals. The Ruben is another excellent sandwich. Off their specialty menu I really enjoy the Clary Silver. It is loaded with pastrami, corned beef, melted swiss and it's served on their yummy rye bread.  My Husband really enjoys the Arlene Bianchi, which I also love! It It has pastrami, turkey and cheese all melted together on a triple deck of sourdough (usually comes on rye, but my husband is weird). You also get a side of your choice, but choose the potato salad. Always potato salad!  Basically anything you get from here is delicious! I've never had a bad experience here. The staff is super friendly and nice. The only downside is that it's small and can get busy during peak hours, but what good place doesn't? When the food is this good, waiting just does not matter to me! If you go for breakfast or lunch you will leave full and happy!",

They were extremely crowded but we were seated right away. However our server was inattentive. We had to ask her several times for several things. At one point we gave up asking her and started asking other servers for help. One of the things we had repeatedly asked for was half-sour pickles. She finally brought them out and they were Rancid. She told us they had come from the freezer and clearly they were no good but she gave them to us anyway. Also our food was only decent. Definitely will not be coming back here again.",

    "text": "This will be a bit of a strange review, I actually sent a dish back, but I like the place...I am jumping ahead of myself.  Last week I was feeling a yucky, the start of a flu bug, or maybe the end, it's hard to tell as these things don't hit me that hard, maybe just some man flu lol.  Anyways, the wife suggested we stop in here for a sandwich and bowl of soup.   This place is straight out of the 70's !  The decor, the menu, the service...All in a good way. We got there around 7pm, the place was slammed, a quick look around showed one waiter and one bus boy..Oh oh I think, this could spell trouble.  But let me say this straight away, if the owner of Weiss's is reading this, give those kids more money, whatever you are paying them is not enough, rarely have I seen two people work an entire restaurant so well, the service was great, friendly and well perfect.  The order was simple.  One bowl of Matzah ball soup, two orders of pastrami on rye with Swiss cheese and fries.  Well the soup order was for a small bowl, we both had some and there was plenty left over, the broth was great, perfect for a sicky like me, my wife said the Matzah ball was good, as ever, we will take her word for it as they are not my thing.  Now the problem, the sandwiches came out, and honestly, I thought they had made a mistake, if you had blindfolded me and said what meat is this I would have said corned beef, the closest thing I can equate the meat to is, well if you have ever tried the pastrami sandwich at Subway, it was close to that, just not as good...So yeah it was bad. As the wife like corned beef (which the server said it wasn't and on closer inspection it did look like pastrami so I will give him the benefit of the doubt there) she kept hers, mine went back, instead I went for an open faced hot roast beef sandwich with gravy.  Now that was a home run, great beef, tender and juicy, the gravy was perfect, just a great sandwich.  All in all a good meal, it could have been a disaster (though I will say, how does a Jewish deli serve bad pastrami) but they fixed the issue I had and again, the waiter was fantastic.  So yes I recommend this place, maybe you should ask for a slice of the pastrami before ordering though to make sure it matches your taste.",

The latkes (3 big cakes) were nicely seasoned and mixed well with the applesauce and sour cream.  The hash can hardly be called hash when the meat content is at least 90%.  The Everything bagel may be popular but my Egg bagel was both light and chewy, perfectly toasted.  It was surprisingly easy to get a table at 9am Saturday morning.  The service was a bit slow -- a little bit of pleasant assertiveness solves the service issue -- but the food is worth the wait.  I'd love to have lunch sometime but the breakfast had me skipping lunch and dinner.  This place is on the permanent list for Vegas.",

Don't worry that a half reuben won't satiate your rumbling belly. Their half reuben is still bigger than a whole one anywhere else. It's a pretty solid showing, though If you, like me are a fan of katz's deli sometimes you don't need a ton of cheese to make a point",

I have heard rave things about Weiss so I though \"I'll give this place a shot!\" I did just that!  I called a fee times to place my order over the phone considering I had to return to work. They never answered even though they were open. So I hopped my little but in the car and went for a drive. I arrived at this little Deli in between a art supply store and a  hair salon. Wasn't anything to be desires by the curb appeal. I entered and it appeared as if I time wrapped to the early 1990s but I digress! I placed my order, paid and waited....and waited...and waited...then waited some more. My food finally after nearly 25 minutes came to me wrapped in a typical plastic bag and screamed to be eaten! (Insert horror flic screams here!) I ordered the Latkes with Brisket and cheese. A first time meal for me,and was looking forward to it! I rushed to work, opened the package and scarfed my first gooey delish bite of pure bliss! I couldn't stop eating it! I kept shoveling the food in my mouth like a starving child! (Or a fat kid in front of cake!)  I was impressed with the Food. No complaints except for appearance and waiting time! If this place can clean up the decor a bit and work on customer service it will get 5 stars soon!",

The menu changed a bit but the food quality is still SO good! Matzah Ball soup fans, this is the place! Great chopped liver, whitefish salad, omlets, challah bread - everything is so good! The downside? The service is VERY inconsistent. The staff will tell you (by talking loudly to eachother) when they feel overwhelmed or too busy or if a customer is annoying them. But we've also have GREAT service on occassion. The food/bakery is good enough to keep us coming back, but we are always apprehensive about the service level, each and every time.",

The name has changed, and the food has gone from excellent to horrible, back to excellent again...you never know what it will be called next. But as of right now, the food at Weiss is awesome. I used to love going to breakfast with my grandfather here, now I thoroughly enjoy a solo breakfast on the patio (when the weather permits) to cure a hangover. I can sit outside and read the paper and sip my tea without too many distractions or noise. It is across the street from the GV library, and in a pretty quiet shopping center. The only time it is really too busy for this is Sundays for brunch. I love the lunch menu too, it reminds me of a Boston deli with corned beef and matzoh ball soup (excellent, by the way) Green Valley lacked breakfast joints for so long, that even though they are popping up a bit now, my loyalties remain with Samueli's, Samuel's, Weiss...whatever it may be called.",

    "text": "I have been here one before so this review is after my second visit.  First....food was good.  Simple presentation and the Leo (Lox eggs and onion scramble) was good but smaller portion for the price.   The waiter was very nice.  The owner on the other hand, was not.  I came with my dad, elderly.  From the same very small town the owner and his parents who co own it I am told, are also from ( in new jersey).  My dad was thrilled someone from his old hometown owned a business here and he looked it up and knows the mom.  When we got seated he asked the waiter if the owner was there, he wanted to say hello, he's from the same small town, knows his mom, who used to own the place.  The waiter was nice and said the owner was in and went to get him.  Waiter came back, asked my dads name, and left again.  Food came, drinks refilled, check paid, owner never comes out to say hi.  How disappointing.  I know that is not part of the restaurant experience but it reflects the attitude  of the owner  I read in some past reviews.  My dad was surprised and commented it's not like we expected a free meal, I just wanted to say hi.  Anyhow, based solely on that, we will not be back. There are other good Jewish delis in the Las Vegas area.  How sad that the owner could not have stepped out on a slow morning ( there were many empty tables when we were there this morning ) and said hello.  They lost a customer and most likely more as my dad is his hoa president in the area and people talk.  Hopefully the owner reads these reviews and acts accordingly in the future.",

    "text": "So, I have to admit something.  I used to be a regular at an awesome German Restaurant in Huntington Beach, CA called the Einbecker Inn.  Used to go there for their awesome Bratwurst and authentice, rare, hard to find German beers. Alas, they are now gone.  So, you can imagine when I saw \"Weiss\" while I was travelin in Las Vegas on business and it had great reviews, I had to try it.  Not really thinking that it's a NY Jewish Deli! (I'm not very quick on the draw with these things).  However, when I got my food here, I was blown away.  This is truly an authentic NY Deli hidden in a strip mall in Vegas!  I ordered the Remington sandwich which is roast beef with two kinds of cheeses, onions, horseradish sauce (missing the German punch).  I changed it up a little bit and ordered it on a french roll with no onions and was absolutely ecstatic.  First, it was huge.  Could have done with half and saved myself from rolling out of the front door.  Second, the roll was golden brown and perfectly toasted.  If you are a fan of horseradish and need the sinus clearing properties of such, ask for extra on the sandwich.  Not enough in my opinion.  It was excellent.  Trying to lose weight for an upcoming wedding and felt guilty eating the whole thing, but seriously...it was worth it.  Adding this restaurant to my favorite locations. Don't let the location, how hidden it is, or the dated motif inside persuade you....it would be a lot worse in NYC and if you lived there you would be a regular.  Get over it....ask for what you want, and enjoy!",

We tried the Matzoh Ball soup, a Corned Beef and Pastrami sandwich, a scoop of Whitefish Salad and we had some Pickles and Pickled tomatoes.  The Matzoh Ball soup was better than most I have had in New York and as good as the best I have had. The Whitefish salad was excellent, nice and smoky, and a big portion as well. The Pastrami and Corned Beef were very good, not quite as good as New Yorks very best, but good enough to go back for. The pickles were very good as well. All that and fries for 35 dollars including tip with portions big enough that we could not finish half (the rest went home with us). Also, the fries that came as a side to the sandwich. They were fresh, crunchy, and a big portion as well. The decor was minimal at best, the staff was courteous and attentive, and we are looking forward to going back to try what is supposed to be the best challah and bagel in the Las Vegas Valley. Also the Rye Bread was home made fresh and better than any in New York.",

I tried the bagel and I must say it was fantastic and the cream cheese is awesome. We also got a blueberry danish that was very good and huge, we didn't even put a dent in it.

    "text": "This place is great but I've gotta break it down.   They make most things \"in-house\" including the breads  The portions are huge  The prices are fair  The taste is great ( we had the Ruben and chicken salad sandwiches)   Now I'm going to explain a few things so you can decide if this place is for you.  The decor is minimal and functional. Its the combo of an east coast Deli and Diner. I don't think you would like it if you're into \"ambiance\", but we loved it because it was just like back home.  Also when I say east coast deli , I don't mean the overpriced , over rated ones that you can sometimes find in Manhattan. I'm talking about the ones where the neighborhood goes for lunch and morning coffee with a bagel.  Now on to the food.  The rye is amazing and the corned beef was out of this world.  The chicken salad was like east coast chicken salad, where the chicken is almost puree and the ingredients seem equal in amounts combined. Most places on the west coast have chicken salad with big chunks of chicken and less of the other ingredients. I think both types are great, it just depends what you like.  The potato salad was close to east coast potato salad (once again I say it so you can get what I mean, not because I just like saying east coast ). There are no bits of egg in it and it has an underlying flavor of vinegar. I added a little salt & pepper to spice it up, it could be considered bland. It's also made mostly with whipped mashed and some small chunks of potato. The fries were fresh and hot.  Now on to the service, which I see has had the most disputed accounts on yelp. When we arrivedt it was around lunch time and the sign said \"please seat yourself\" so we did. The bus boy came quickly to take our drink order. The waitress came several times to see if we were ready to order, which could be misconsTrued for \"rushing you\" depending on how sensitive you are. The food came within 10 minutes and we were pleasantly surprised with the portions (as I said previously). The waitress wasn't very engaging at first , but after our food came, she checked on us several times. As we commented on what we liked she told us more about how the food is made and the owners. She was very pleasant.  As we were eating we could hear some employees discuss an issue regarding duties and other employees. Now if you are like most people you would find this inappropriate, but for us it felt like home. In any NY deli on any given day you can find the employees discussing everything from their after work plans to their cousin's bypass surgery while they take your order and make your food. I mean really have you met an \"East Coaster\" that hasn't tried to tell you their life story?  So now that you know,  you can decided for yourself. As for us it was definitely \"East Coast Official\" and our new favorite place",

    "text": "This by far was my worst dining experience since moving to Las Vegas/Henderson 3 years ago.  First of all I know Jewish Deli's.  Living in LA I've been to the best. Nate n Als, Brents, Canters and Juniors. Factors and Solleys too.  This place Weiss' in Henderson is below average at best, but I went there because it was the only place around with jewish plates like Matzoh Ball Soup and Potato Latkes. The chef/owner Michael Weiss' ego  couldn't fathom that his Brisket of Beef was dry and I ordered something else. Which I happily paid for. He didn't want to take it off the bill, but did after complaining for a while to the waiter in the kitchen.  It was so obvious he was offended, that I became offended that he would question my taste.  I actually got up from the booth and walked to the kitchen window... (since I could hear everything he was whining about) and told him the brisket wasnt good. I let him know who I was and where I worked by throwing my very Jewish named business card next to his hand.  He finally took it off.   On my way out I asked the young waiter if the guy in the kitchen was the owner. He said yes, and said that's why he was offended. He also told me my \"demeanor\" wasnt  very good and I handled the situation wrong... Who the hell is he? Gordon Ramsey? What nerve to tell off a customer twice his age. Let alone anybody. I am assuming he's the son because he was very rude and defensive. I then walked to the table and took back his  25 % tip.  He told me not to come back in.  REALLY??? Because I wanted to come back for dinner. Darn it!  A food critic I know who was interviewing me this week anyway got a call early.  She then called Mr. Weiss for reaction.  In a nutshell he told me and her to F-off.  He says the RJ food critic Heidi Rinella once skewered his pastrami in a review... and that he sold more Pastrami after that then ever. He says any publicity is good publicity.  Have you noticed that people who offer crappy service and a bad product are the only ones who use that phrase?  If you like a bunch of cheap and pompous asses serving you mediocre food....then YES I hope I can help direct business to the restaurant.",

Everything was homemade from the Jewish rye to the Russian dressing. Their menu is extensive and everyone at our table loved their food. And yes, the service was just fine. It wasn't rush hour lunch but where is service great at 12:15?",

    "text": "Ok. Ever seen one of those early Martin Scorcese films in NY where the characters eat in a diner/deli? Well this place has that feel. A little bakery on the side with whitefish and tasteycakes. fresh challah bread. and the best damn chicken salad you will ever put on bread....but enough about the bakery.  This joint...and i call it a joint as a term of endearment is crazy good. Breakfast will send you home feeling like home. The lunch has these open face sandwiches that are monster and to die for. now don't get me wrong...this place aint too much to look at...but the food is amazing. If you live in Las Vegas or Henderson and if you ain't eating here then your a shmuck. NO SERIOUSLY.  Man the Hash stack is crazy good with creamy horseradish and if you want a sandwich...ask for a box to take home when you order it. Pickles are great too. I once took my family here for a holiday breakfast...of course i knew i had to wait...but if they know you...your golden...so get to know the staff. Their great. They got us right in; then they wowed the fam.   Just cause this place is a small and off the map doesn't mean it doesn't have a following. If you try to go in for breakfast on the weekend...you might wait...cause its that busy...FOR A REASON.  While all the idiots go to islop or to a chain for breakfast or lunch...THE TRUE CATS KNOW WHERE TO GO FOR A DAMN GOOD PLATE.",

It bums me out when I think of all the crappy meals I ate when I could have been eating here.  The pastrami is always key for me in a deli, and Weiss' is great, not Langer's great but pretty good nonetheless, and they make their rye in-house. The open faced brisket sandwich with mashed potatoes an brown gravy is comfort-food heaven, and I haven't had a bad breakfast yet. The desserts in the to-go area, particularly the cherry breakfast pastry and the massive brownie, are all good. Decor is a bit lacking, but when the food is this good in a neighborhood joint- who cares?",

Both meals were great- piping hot, salty but not too salty, crisp and not soggy, etc. Eggs were cooked well. It just seems like they actually care about their food. Oh another plus is that they give you a giant orange juice unlike most places that give you a shot glass. 2 giant meals and a drink for $24. Overall great experience.",

We had pastrami on rye - delicious   Bread was fresh and the pastrami was moist and flavorful.  We also had whitefish salad on a bagel which was great. I don't think the white fish was homemade - tasted like acme, but I LOVE Acme whitefish salad. Finally we tried the French toast - perfect French toast.  Service was good and we managed to avoid a wait.  Will be back next time we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "Nothing could be finer than a breakfast at a diner, especially when it's served up with fresh ingredients in generous portions. It isn't technically a diner I suppose, but Weiss has that feeling about it: sparse decor, super efficient waitress and a stream of regulars.   The menu features a lot of things I wanted to try: potato cakes, epic sounding french toast and pancakes, some tempting oatmeal. (Yes, oatmeal tempts me.) However, I ultimately decided on \"The Farmers' Market\" hash because I could not deny the long list of vegetables being dealt with their homefries and smothered in cheese. It's like a sophisticated Waffle House scattered and covered gone Californian. Not a single vegetable was from a can!  To keep it simple: I loved it. I almost choked on potatoes while shoveling them into my gullet.   Now, on this morning I was a little sleep-deprived and away from my home base. I was hoping I would be able to set up my laptop for about 20 minutes for some must-do business. However, that was a no-go. We started getting suspicious glances from the waitress and coffee refills halted. I am not really holding it against them. I have waited tables, and I appreciate that \"campers\" can be frustrating. Just a little PSA that this is not a place for working remotely.  However, it is a place for a hearty, comfort food breakfast and a chewy bagel. Sometimes you can't have it all, but good eats should always come first!",

The first time we went we got a couple orders of the chicken noodle soup and took home their homemade cream cheese for breakfast the next morning.  Let me tell you their chicken noodle soup was amazing it was just like the soup my Jewish grandmother used to make me. Oh the memories it brought back!  The broth was sooooo tasty and not oily the chicken is moist they use white and dark meat and that makes a huge difference and then the noodles they are so yummy I believe they may be a fettuccine noodle but I could be wrong there definitely not an egg noodle that I'm sure of. Okay enough about the soup let's talk homemade cream cheese! Holy amazingness they use a Philadelphia cream cheese base and then they add creams and things to it. We had the regular cream cheese and the lox cream cheese both were so yummy we finished them off in one day and I had to go back for more the next day!  I will never go back to Philadelphia cream cheese plain  I will only eat cream cheese from here now. I honestly am so excited to go back here again and try some of their sandwiches!",

    "text": "I believe that \"Weiss\" is German for white. How appropriate. The food couldn't get any more white, bland and tasteless. I was really eager to try this place. The pictures looked great, the reviews were good, and I saw on the menu that they had cabbage soup, which I loved from Foxy's and from Jackie's in Commercial Center- two late lamented delis which reveal how incredibly old I am. So, and equally decrepit friend and I grabbed our walkers and shuffled on down. It was busy, but we were seated quickly and service was efficient if not particularly friendly. So far, so good.  We were disappointed that they didn't bring us a dish of pickles or a basket of rye bread, which were standard in the aforementioned old-school spots, but then, nobody pumps your gas for you anymore, either, so still o.k. I was trying to be conservative on calories so I had a 1/2 brisket on rye with cabbage soup, my friend went wild with a triple decker concoction involving corned beef, pastrami, and cole slaw. First, we got the soup. I was expecting a rich, tangy, tomato base. This was more brown. You know how when you cook soup and store it overnight it's usually better the next day? Well, this was more like they had been reheating it and keeping it hot every day for about a week so it just tasted old. The accompanying hard toasted bagel slices were clearly a creative use of leftovers that would have been thrown away. I am a crostini fan so I liked them. My friend did not. Then came the sandwiches. They looked good. Until I opened mine to add mustard. The brisket was mostly fat, and wet, soggy fat at that. Like catching a glimpse of myself getting out of the shower. Her pastrami and corned beef were almost tasteless. Again, I think they sliced the meat and held it in hot water repeatedly until they managed to leach out any semblance of flavor.  The only thing they didn't soak were the pickles, which still tasted raw. After sampling those and the flavorless rye bread, I no longer yearned for the free samples. I will say that the chicken noodle soup looked great, as did the breakfast ordered at another table. But ours LOOKED good, too. And what does it say about a menu where the standout is chicken soup? Bland, bland, bland.",

They try to give you that deli feel we get back home but they don't put pickles on the table anymore and it's gotten further away from a NY deli thru the years. The sandwiches however are nice and thick loaded with fresh meats. The bakery section is quite small compared to others and the challah is better other places. But the food is good and enjoyable, if you get deli food, not a burger.... (Like someone at our table did....) The customer service has been variable the times we have been there and the cleanliness has varied too. Not sure if because of how long they have been there or what but hasn't been remodeled. Depending on when you go, you can be waiting awhile too as the place is quite small. I like this place and the local business but overall it's changed a lot thru the years!",

Both sandwiches were stuffed with the meat.  However, by taking it to-go, the thin bread does not hold up well.  We recommend that you have your sandwiches there.

We are usually here on Sunday morning and even when full the wait staff is quick and efficient.  The food is always hot and very tasty.  I had the french toast special with a huge pile of fruit. A berry with every bite.  That made my OCD self very happy.  The took good care of my daughter by putting chocolate chips in her single pancake.  She was in heaven and ate more than usual.  My wife also enjoyed her bagel, as she is always a fan of fresh baked bread products.   It will continue to a special place to take my family for Sunday breakfast.  Just thinking about makes me wish it was Sunday.",

They're very crowded and usually very busy every time I've come but the food is worth the wait. The place is not fancy it's usually pretty clean and it's always noisy and busy. Again the food is very good the portions are decent but don't expect your coffee to be refilled when it's empty. You may have to flag down a different waitress or a busser to get a refill on your water or coffee. To me the food is worth it and I go in knowing what to expect.",

Today we came in a little later in the day and had the pleasure of enjoying lunch. I got a half Reuben (if that's the half the whole must weigh more than the table!) With a small bowl of chili and hot green tea. It was all delicious and way more food than I could eat. Better half got the hot roast beef with mashed potatoes and gravy. In a word: fantabulous. The highlight, however, as always was the service! Jaques is fantastic. Super charming, gracious, never forgets anything, amazing good manners uncommon in society these days.  We both just adore him.",

Food is amazing, portion sizes are very generous (Omelettes and French Toasts are HUGE), service is great and to top it off prices are cheap! Do yourself a favor and stop off here for breakfast instead of spending a fortune in any casino/resort on the strip with mediocre food and you will be surprisingly very pleased and satisfied! Haven't been here for lunch or dinner but I would assume it's just as good! Keep up the good work and food Weiss!",

The service is very friendly and attentive.  Now what you want to know is the food, so here is what we had:  1) Ciely's Stack with the brown gravy on the side. The thing was mongo huge! The braised brisket wasn't dry, but not moist. The gravy and cheese mixed with brisket on top of the potato was super yum.  Gravy on the side let's you combine with fries too!  If anything I would ask for a little less cheese, but that's a personal preference.  2) The Remington was great quite amazing. The salted cucumber that came with the sandwich was surprisingly very tasty. It was like perfect open face sandwich with roast beef, horse radish, onions on top of rye bread and smothered in melted cheese.  Again huge portion.  3) The Challah French toast....holy crap this was awesome!  Super soft and full of deliciousness.  If you like the cinnamon flavor you'll love this.  The only thing you might want to add on this is some strawberries.....and ice cream!   Next time I will try the pastrami, that looked amazing.",

Comes with plenty of veggies and olives and a bagel. Probably should have ordered two bagels because it's a lot of food for one sitting. Took some home and finished later. Also tried the matzo ball chicken noodle soup. Really good stuff. Giant matzo ball, probably could have been smaller. But all good. A little crowded at times, but decent environment. Serve beer and wine. Not a bad spot. Worth checking out.",

I recently moved right across the street and thankfully I yelped the area and I found Weiss. It's tucked back in the corner of the Trader Joe's shopping center so it isn't the greatest location but I hope that more people find it like I did. I love the people that work here, I love the food that they bring me, and I love the prices I pay. I stop in here a lot in the mornings for a quick bite before work (as, it would appear when I'm there, a lot of others do) and the service is always quick and easy.   Specific recommendations: black mountain benedict, everything bagel (either just with cream cheese or as the bread for any of the sandwiches), the latkes, the omelets, the French toast... I guess everything. But seriously that black mountain benedict is amazing and the everything bagel is the best I've ever had. And of course you have to get a black and white cookie and a danish from the bakery. They're huge and pretty exquisite.   Eventually I'll make it in here for lunch/dinner but as it is I'm perfectly happy to eat multiple breakfasts per week in here.",

I've had matzoh soup in San Francisco at another deli, but Weiss is far better.  Fluffy, tasty dumpling in delicious, hearty soup.  The corned beef was delicious.  I had a vegetable sandwich.  My only complaint is that the caraway seed in the rye bread overpowered the taste of the vegetables.  I should have asked for a different bread choice.    No one left hungry, that's for sure!",

    "text": "I'm considering calling Weiss the 'Last Of the Great Delis' in Nevada!  Even if you have to drive from Summerlin like my fiancee and I do to eat at this fine establishment, believe us...IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT!  Inspired by watching the documentary 'Deli Man' last year, we decided to research what delis are still left here in Nevada.  Very few sadly.  Along with my family, I've seen a wide variety of great delis in Las Vegas come and go since 2004.  It's very unfortunate to see how buffets, food trucks, and fusion eateries are causing delis to disappear more and more in Nevada.  Luckily in researching what's still here, we came across Weiss Deli and Bakery in Henderson.  It's absolutely the best we've tasted in a long time!  I'm Jewish but my fiancee isn't, however she has been learning more and more about Jewish culture and cuisine and she absolutely loves it!  My Mother even got her a cookbook of old Jewish recipes!  Weiss has one of the tastiest bowls of matzohball soup ever!  My Grandmother would roll over in her grave if I said it was better than hers, so I'll just say it is equally as good!  Their fish platters are amazing.  A hefty helping of lox or white fish with a nice plain bagel, sliced tomato, capers, onion, lettuce (I never eat lettuce but it comes with it), olives, cream cheese, and the pickle...can't forget the pickle! Weiss has some amazingly delicious pickles!  I'd love to just order a bowl of them!  Plus, their signature overstuffed sandwiches are so big and savory, you'll probably need to eat them over the course of two days!  They also have Doctor Brown's soda for drinking too!  Next time I go, I am definitely going to get a bottle of cream soda! Haven't had that in soooo long!  Weiss is a friendly place that's perfect for large parties as well as small groups.  I highly recommend checking them out!  From the looks of it, they're not about to be leaving Nevada any time soon!",

They have a sit down restaurant and a to go counter where you can get things like Matzo Ball soup, Lox, pickles, and bagels. They rearranged their dining area a few years back so they can seat more people and it's always packed on the weekends. They have bussers and waiters that have been there for years and they employ a lot of young people but everyone is always SO friendly and consistent. Their coffee is also some of my favorite: Douwe Egberts. You definitely won't need cream or sugar.   Their bagels are usually my go-to (with lox or.. in a sandwich or even just with cream cheese). Most of their breakfast and lunch specials are amazing as well. Everything is amazing, seriously. My boyfriend recently had their special of coconut and almond pancakes. Three gigantic pancakes, major fluffiness. And somehow we couldn't stop eating them. I've always wanted to try their lunch and especially Matzo Ball soup but I usually can't pass up their bagels. I still feel like this is hidden gem in the overall world of Las Vegas but the Green Valley and east side definitely know what's up with Weiss.",

We were there when it opened, for breakfast, and all I can say was great service and great \"comfort\" food. We all had variety of dishes, corn beef hash & eggs, bagels with lox(smoked salmon plate) and kids choices of more bagels with cream cheese.  The food was delicious and bagels were fresh. This is definitely on my return list next time we in Vegas.",

I had heard good things about Weiss from my coworkers  I Ordered over the phone, asking for a 1/2 sandwich and I ended up getting a full sandwich. I didn't want to argue because I was hungry and didn't want to risk waiting longer for them to correct the error. I thought that maybe it was a good thing and I would end up with enough left over for lunch tomorrow.   I am not a picky person but I cannot help but being majorly disappointed.   The rye Bread was so soggy due to the amount of tomato and lettuce on the sandwich.   The upside was that the Pastrami was hot and fresh. Potato salad was very tasty as well but the pickle on the side tasted very odd. Maybe this being a Jewish deli the pickles are seasoned differently ? I am a pickle fanatic but couldn't push myself to eat the whole thing.  In the end I paid $13 for soggy mess of a sandwich that (despite being cut in half) I couldn't even pick up to eat. I ended up using the huge pieces of lettuce to make a wrap. This was not what I had hoped to have for lunch but I made it work.   Service was friendly and fast. I do not believe I will be back. The search continues!",

There was nothing in the menu indicating they are going to be trashing the staple item of every Jewish deli. I could taste between the horrible gravy that the brisket was not good. The service was also lousy. They would not let substitute the mashed potatoes with veggies but they would for French fries which made no sense. We asked for bagel with lax. When the bill came they charged $3 for 3 slices of tomato, $3 for the cheese... in short we got stuck with an $80 bill! We threw out the left overs because they stunk to high heaven.",

I was seated almost immediately and the staff was friendly.  The menu is truly one of a Jewish deli. I came for a pastrami sandwich and that is what I ordered. The sand which was huge. The pastrami was close to perfect for my taste. To me it lacked some smokiness flavor and although the meat was juicy, it was close to but not melt in your mouth. The rye bread tasted good but proper Jewish deli rye bread should have a crispy crunch and his bread was lacking that. The side of cole slaw was great.  I will have to return to try the many other dishes that they have to offer.",

Make a quick stop in the bakery and grab some bagels or pastries, or grab a seat and order off of their menu...or follow what we did, and do both.  They have a full breakfast menu with some corned beef hash, a healthy but not overbearing list of sides and omelette options...but the real flavor is in the deli sandwiches. I went with some exploration of a pastrami sandwich, but could have been happy with tongue, liver, or corned beef. The everything bagels were also made properly: browned to perfection and heavy on the seasonings.  Service is about what you'd expect at an old style Jewish deli. None of this matters, though, because look at this pastrami sandwich.",

    "text": "I get really bent when ppl whine about the ambiance of this type of place. It's an old ass well worn deli. That IS the ambiance!!! You don't go to Picasso (mmm.....lol) for a bagel! Ok..had to be said, so here we go:  The matzoh ball soup is really a 2 star to me, my girls (who'll do their own review) would prob say 3. It does have a chicken flavor that doesn't taste of chix base, I'll give it that, but it is definitely not cooked down enough (i.e. watery) and has neither enough veg or herbs for my taste. I agree with the yelpers who say Bagel Cage's is better. A good chicken broth must be rich in celery, onion and carrot flavors as well as chicken. Matzoh ball was a bit mealy too...  Now, moving on to the yum portion of the review! The lox platter was divine. The bagel crisp/chewy, the lox firm and fresh, and all the bells and whistles were perfect. (their capers were different than any I've tasted...almost boozy??? dunno...I liked 'em!)  The whitefish salad was soooo good! One child did not like it, but the other loved it and so did I. Finely minced, perfectly smoked and seasoned, the kid and I devoured it with their crispy, delicious bagel chips. We were glad kid #2 didn't like it! I also agree with the yelpers who prefer Weiss' whitefish salad over Bagel Cafe's.  The service was pretty good. We were checked on often, just never with coffee pot in hand. I had to flag for my refills, but the coffee was very good.  We've also had their corned beef hash, and loved it.  Over all, with the exception of the matzoh ball soup, I highly recommend this place...complete with it's comfy old booths and tables.",

Starve before you go or plan on leftovers. The breakfasts look nice but I haven't tried them yet, I liked how they have a fruit option. I saw another diners plate and the fruit was a nice bowl of melon, oranges strawberries.  Even the coffee is good.  They have a take out section on the side where you can get deli stuff and danishes etc. The Danish is gigantic and very heavy, be warned its super thick and loaded with sugar and cream cheese or cherries or whatever it is that day. Everyone ate a little square off one to try it out. It just may be impossible to eat one by yourself. Most pastries are lighter or airy this is not.  Unfortunately for me I can't go here or when do I will have to be careful with what I order, I think I am allergic to something they use in their ingredients or maybe it's gluten..no idea. But something makes me sickly when I eat there which is a shame. Please note I am not flaming the place they are clean and attentive I highly doubt its them. I am just getting old I guess digestion isn't what it used to be. :(  Personal drama aside this is a great deli. You get a lot for your money. The decor is dated but who cares when you aren't being ripped off like in most of the restaurants in the area.",

    "text": "This is by far one of the hidden gems of Las Vegas/Henderson. I LOVE THIS PLACE! It's a good 'ol Jewish deli like the ones I grew up with in NJ. It's usually crowded here during breakfast and lunch so take that into consideration. The food portions are HUGE but everything I've tried is super yummy! I will let you in on a little secret....the chicken noodle soup is magical! When I'm sick, Weiss's chicken soup is the only thing I ever want to eat. It's plain, old fashioned chicken noodle soup so don't come in expecting anything fancified. The beef and cabbage soup is also surprisingly good! I love that they sell bags of bagel chips to take home and crush up into the soups later on. The hash dishes are great, benedicts are tasty and sandwiches are stacked high. For True east coasters, this place is like a short trip back home and always feels like family, KEEP UP THE MAGIC WEISS!",

    "text": "I had the traditional corned beef on rye (whole) and my son had a tuna melt. He enjoyed his sandwich which was served open face and smothered with cheese. Both entrees were huge and should have been shared. My sandwich was dry and tasteless. Anticipating this possibility I ordered a side of slaw. Sometimes a great cole slaw can really help a dry corned beef sandwich and elevate it to an outstanding meal. Not the case at Weiss's. Their slaw was absolutely tasteless too - basically watered down mayonaise as the dressing - and horrible mayo at that. Very disappointing.   We had high hopes as we wanted to try a non-strip deli (beyond Canters and Carnegie) and hoping for a great find. I was disappointed. The prices are lower than on the strip, so I didn't feel absolutely ripped off.",

    "text": "This time tried the corned beef sandwich and chicken soup combo. The order took forever, getting a knife took several requests. The soup was ok, the sandwich was a mess, a bunch of corned beef slapped between 2 pieces of bread that themselves were falling apart. It wasn't a pleasant experience trying to eat the sandwich, nor did the taste warrant the effort. Did I mention the service was slow and uncaring?  Honestly after several visits I'd skip the restaurant and go to the takeout deli. Get the half sour pickles and dilled green tomatoes. The meat unfortunately is way way overpriced, i couldn't believe the prices they slapped on the meat to go.   Stick with the pickles and dilled green tomatoes, and skip everything including the restaurant, which reminds me of an uncaring mediocre dining room in a Jewish retirement home.  3 stars for the pickles and dilled tomatoes, 1 star for the service and food.",

Service was friendly and quick. I ordered the whole pastrami on rye with fries and it was delivered to the table in under 10 minutes.   The pastrami was delicious and even though some people would do a double take at the price, the portion was very large and well worth the cost in my opinion.  The pickle was very good and reminded me of going to the farmer's market in LA when I was a kid and my parents getting us kosher pickles.  The pickled green tomato though... Wow! It blew me away.

Walked-in at 5:50PM on a Friday & sat myself, as directed by the sign.  6 minutes later, a guy stopped by the table & asked what I wanted to drink, but it took a little over 10 minutes before waitress Margie stopped by & took my order (the place was only about 1/4 full at the time).  I ordered an egg salad sandwich with lettuce, onions & cheese, and that they could hold the pickle & olive that the menu indicated came on the side with sandwiches.     I asked for the sandwich on an onion roll, but they don't have that.  The sandwich arrived about 15 minutes after ordering, and Margie didn't catch that it came with tomato on it, plus the olive & pickle on the side -- poor attention to detail, but not a huge deal.  I learned the hard way that they put ground up red & green pepper in their egg salad mix.  Seems inappropriate to me, as it has a major effect on the flavor.  I drowned that flavor away by adding deli mustard.  May be an 'authentic' (but plain-looking) & populate deli, but I won't have a need to return.  I was really excited to try this deli, hoping it'd be the source of a great egg salad sandwich, but the service & good didn't do much for me.   May be an 'authentic' (but plain-looking) & popular deli, but I won't have a need to return.  Nicest experience was that after refilling my iced tea, the bus boy left the pitcher on my table so I could refill my own glass.",

The bagel chips with the soup are a perfect pairing.  The sandwiches are huge and delicious. The bakery has all essentials, from the biggest hamentashen I've ever seen, to rughelach galore, and beautifully braided challah.  Highly recommend it if you are craving Ashkenazi food from your childhood!",

Moving to Vegas from la I really missed deli's that are on every corner back home so finding this little gem was so exciting! We ordered: 3 Pastrami sandwiches with fries: the sandwiches are huge, we could have order one but so delicious. The fries I wouldn't order again.  2 burgers: huge portions! The burger buns where fresh, every bite was heavenly! As we where leaving they brought out a fresh tray of rye bread, of course I had to buy a loaf.",

Ok they where trying something different but, this is Vegas and not New York City. But when doing this put enough filling to compensate the thickness of the cookie. It was sooo dry & I was drinking tea with this. Bland taste and really never tasted the filling because the cookie took over.",

When the lunch arrived though... (next day...) the French Toast looked great!!! But no syrup ...  called back in to the deli...  and staff was not so eager to hear the news...  I asked if they could have the manager give me a call back.  But no call.... So I called in the next day because Sara was off...  and she was yet again very apologetic and was very sincere when apologizing  for the lack of concern the day before form the staff!!!  So we will definitely order again !!!!   Thanks to Sara!!!!   Hope their management team reads these posts and gives Sara a thumbs up and a bonus!!!  Everyone loved their lunch!!!",

I like deli food so I'll keep coming back...my 2 star given is because the employees/servers that work here are just CONSTANTLY arguing amongst themselves or dishing attitude to customers.  the food is good. I typically get the pastrami sandwich. they serve it as a sloppy pile of meat on your bread of choice, which doesn't bother me much. the matzo ball soup, not bad at all...  but every single time I'm in here the servers and cooks are fighting amongst each other. the seating area is not large at all, so the patrons are kind of on top of each other if packed in the room. there is no music playing so you hear everything going on..  so to give you example of what I mean...you'll be sitting there eating your food and out of nowhere you'll hear \"order up\" from the cook and the server just yells from across the room \"I KNOW\" and not the friendly tone.   as we were walking into the place the last time a gentlemen in uniform was complaining loudly about his work. this was before we stepped foot inside.  another example, sitting down eating a separate time and 3 servers were just going at it, arguing about the dumbest stuff all taking place in front of us..  this also carries over into the \"deli\" area at the front. if busy, the girls there are yelling and arguing with each other, and I've seen them dish attitude our way like we are doing ourselves a favor in buying there.  this can't be news to management, if there is any, because it happens every time I come here. I dunno who owns this place or who is in charge but they let them run lose for sure.",

There rye bagel hit the spot as well as the lox. YUM! YUM! YUM!  I took home some bagels and lox for the rest of the family.

The place was doing a brisk business at lunch and now I know why!  Lots to choose from on the menu.  It's a real old school deli with large portion sizes and reasonable prices.  Salads, soups, sandwiches...  for a first timer, the menu can be overwhelming.  They also do breakfast too!  I tried the Open face Brisket sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy.  Melt in your mouth goodness!  Fork tender brisket with a great brown gravy!  Our server was wonderful too!  Helpful and friendly!  Definitely a place to try again and again!",

The hubby got the hash which was huge! We should have shared it. And I don't like corned beef and this one was so tender and flavorful! I took a couple bites just to make sure I wasn't imagining it. Ha! My smoked Lox Benny was good. The lox was cooked and a bit too salty for me. The poached eggs were perfect tho! Soft cooked whites with tender, silky yolk.  Because it's a deli, we had to try their everything bagel and their rye bagel. Both were really good. I'm just a bit too biased ... In that I love NYC bagels. I don't know what it is... New York City just does bagels differently and I love them! Anyways, I digress.  Lots of options!  So if you are indecisive, this could be a problem because everything sounded and looked good.  There is a deli store attached in case you want to take home some bagels or cream cheese or lox or salads or such.   Will definitely be back to try more of the menu!",

I especially appreciate it in their breakfast sandwich (The Usual). The french toast is huge and delicious and their pancakes are really good- they remind me of DuPars. The combos at Weiss are a great value! I think they have a better bagel than Bagelmania and I might even like their bagels/breakfast menu more than Bagel Cafe's (gasp!). I do wish there was more bagel variety; I've never been able to get a blueberry bagel there and I think our server this last time said they don't make blueberry. I really appreciate that they don't burn all or any of the garlic on their garlic bagel. Everything is affordable and the portions are generous.",

I had a corned beef sandwich with coleslaw.  My friend had a pastrami sandwich with fruit.  Both of our sandwiches were huge and the meat was moist and flavorful.  As good as NY deli?  Maybe not, but quite satisfying for a LV deli.  Another friend had \"Man's Best Friend\".... a hot dog!  She enjoyed it.  My wife ordered a bowl of the matzoh ball soup, which she declared to be one of the best she's ever had:  large, fluffy matzoh ball; light broth; plenty of noodles and veggies.  It came with bagel chips, which soaked up the soup and were quite tasty.  The large portion made a full meal.  For dessert, we split a large black & white cookie.  A perfect end to a delicious meal.",

    "text": "The Asian in me is drawn to the odd cuts of meat that Americans throw away as scraps. Due to this fact, I naturally gravitated to this Jewish deli. I love tongue and was even more enthusiastic when I saw their specials board. The offering of calves liver and onions ($15.95) caught my eye and I knew I had to get it. Liver has a strong flavor that can be off putting for most, but growing up with all these alternative cuts, I enjoyed it. The caramelized onions where sweet and contrasted well with the salty/peppery bacon. Add a brown gravy on top and the dish was tasty. If that was not enough food, it came with a choice of soup or side salad, veggies, and mashed or broiled potatoes. I am starting to think that the Jews and Asians share similar souls because of what we are willing to eat and the quantity given. Nothing that came out of the kitchen was skimpy or small. In fact, most things could probably be shared. Watching the monster sandwiches pass by made my friend question how someone could eat it without dislocating their jaw.  Sadly, this score is given for the lack of customer service. The busser did not look too please when we first entered and sat ourselves. After we asked for water, refills did not come often. After a few rounds, he got the hint and topped off our glasses. The server took our orders, delivered our food, and asked if we were ok in passing. When she wasn't doing one of these tasks, I did not see her.",

    "text": "The Weiss deli was a good find.  I stumbled across it one day in the back of a strip shopping center at Green Valley Parkway and Sunset in Henderson, and have returned there many times since.  Weiss in Henderson and the Bagel Cafe near Summerlin are my two favorite Jewish delis in the LV area.  Having lived in Manhattan (NYC) for so long where I had my choice of high quality delis, Weiss probably comes the closest in comparison to any found in NYC.  The food is prepared the way a traditional Jewish \"bubbie\" would make it (lol).  Try the pancakes...they use a special cake flour from overseas that makes their pancakes flavorful and fluffy.  They're killer, and put ANY IHOP or Denny's to shame.  I introduced several of my friends to Weiss and they ALL go bonkers over the pancakes. Weiss makes a proper chicken soup, too.  If you order one, the tasty baseball-sized matzo ball is like a prize in the the middle of your big bowl to keep carving into.  I also like the chopped chicken liver pate.  Not too many people would order such a delicacy, but it's the best I've found in Las Vegas--and I'm picky.  Lastly, the sandwiches are generously portioned and made the right way.  Simple, high-quality ingredients are used--none of that processed \"meat\" you find at Subway or other sandwich shops.  The bread is freshly baked and cut on the premises.  At Weiss, the full menu is available all day long, so you can have those special pancakes for lunch or dinner if you want.  And as you leave, stop by the adjoining bakery, for a sack of fresh bagels to go or a sweet rugelach bite for dessert.  I highly recommend Weiss for a good value, high quality, authentic Jewish deli meal anytime.",

It's brisket sandwiched between two giant latkes, smothered in brown gravy. Mmmm. This place has the best challah in town, surpassing even the venerable Bagel Cafe. However, I must say I like Bagel Cafe's matzo ball soup and hamantaschen better. The hamantaschen at Bagel Cafe are of the softer variety and have a nice lemon zest in the very flavorful dough. I know Weiss receives laudits for the matzo ball soup, but I found it didn't have quite the garlic kick I desired. The corned beef hash here is superb as is the smoked whitefish, which I find much more satisfying than Bagel Cafe's chunkier variety. You must have their blueberry danish, which is out of this world. It has a delectable cheese and a compote-like filling which is amazing. On my last visit, I was a little surprised that they seemed to have changed the menu, as they axed much of their traditional Jewish dinner entree fare. Disappointing :(.",

Intent on breaking that streak, and trying one of \"The Best of Green Valley\", I sent the Hubbers here on a Friday night to pick up some food to go.   He got a couple of small matzoh ball soups, (which were huge, by the way),  a couple of sandwiches, and a black and white cookie. I  had originally thought we were going to share a Reuben, and then he comes home with 2 whole sandwiches! We both enjoyed the matzoh ball soup, and it was our first time trying it altogether. The soup was filled with chunks of pulled apart chicken, carrots, and skinny noodles. I prefer my soup to be a tad saltier, but I would order it again. My Reuben was ENORMOUS. It came stuffed with sauerkraut, cheese, and pulled high on rye bread: perfectly toasted, perfect amount of thousand island. I loved the little side of cole slaw too. It was such a big sandwich (on top of splitting a small soup), that I got 2 meals out of it. My husband had a Remington sandwich made with roast beef and horseradish. He enjoyed his sandwich as well. So much in fact, that he was wanting to go back and see how Weiss Deli is on breakfasts. The cashier had handed him a menu with his takeout order and he is very eager to return and try more things.",

The food is good, the menu is perfect but the price is way too high.  $16.00 for a sandwich kills the idea of eating a sandwich.  It has way too much meat on it, probably not proportional to a typical sized person.  Eating a good deli sandwich shouldn't be a food challenge.  The soups are great, the pastries are eh.. ok. What killed this review is the language behind the counter.  F bombs and other colorful words were dropped as casual as could be.  The wait staff however were very patient with rude customers so I give them credit for being professional at the front of the house, the back could use some curb.

But greeting at door and or the table might be nice. Taking less than 20 minutes to take a drink order might have added a star. Saw the food under the lamp for 2 of the 4 orders 45 minutes later, then 10 minutes later the French toast came on a dirty plate that actually made the French toast taste like garlic and a Large dirty smudge of different color under the French toast. The orders came 5 minutes apart and the omelette was dry spinach on the outside and semi cold home fries. The redeeming value was the staff Was pleasant when they showed up to the table. Needs some attention to details on the staff. Simple basics that used to be there, but are missing now.   It might be a while before I dare going back though.   I took the lack of charging us for coffee as an apology, but I think it was more likely attention to detail.  I made that undercharge go on the tip that I struggled to give my normal 20% standard.",

We had potato pancakes with brisket and the most delicious gravy, Pastrami sandwich, and of course matzo ball soup.  We were beyond full, but it was so delicious that we just couldn't have any leftovers.  Worth the trip from anywhere in the valley.",

After living in Hong Kong for the past 14 years a proper jewish deli was something I missed dreadfully so now onto the review.  Upon walking in with my buddy the priest, I noticed this was the old Samueli's deli.  So having gone there a bit during my university days I was quite pleased.  Then I noticed it was even better than samueli's.  Hot Turkey open faced sandwich to die for, latkas to die for, bread pudding is so huge you take half home. Actually everything so huge you take leftovers.  I have been going about once a month and I havent had anything bad.  The partially cured pickles are great also. Matzo ball soup is also good.  Everybody walking in acts like a kid on their way to Disneyland.  Service is friendly.  New york diner ambience, not a bad word to say about the place other than I wish they had a nap room in the back after I eat there.",

Not much they can do, unless the next door neighbor moves out, I guess.The staff is great--friendly and have been there quite a while. I recommend the fried bologna sandwich on rye with Provolone or the smoked lox platter. Also, the corned beef sandwiches, and the omelets in the morning. When they have the split pea soup, it's very good, too. I often have friends tell me about their standing date on a certain day of the week to go to Weiss's, so I know it's a favorite for many.",

Let's just say they were seriously unprepared for their re-open. They had one server who was clearly needing help serving. The busboy got our drinks and was actually much more friendly than the server. She came and took out orders w/o even saying hello and was very curt. We got our soups promptly and were seated close enough to the kitchen that we could hear that they were clearly out of A LOT of things and the server was not happy and barking orders at both the cook and the busboy.   The soups were still excellent and the busboy was great w/keeping our drinks filled. We got our food and the busboy accidentally spilled a little soda in my potato salad, I didn't even notice. But he did and promptly apologized and explained he would get another one since he'd spilled soda in mine. I then heard him explain to the server what had happened and heard her belittle him while explaining to the cook why another potato salad was needed. I would say we got the best service by far from the busboy and it sucked that the server treated him so poorly. She clearly needed help both serving and with attitude.   We regularly dine at Weiss' and always enjoy the food. We always get excellent service from the young male server that works there, the female servers not so much.",

We decided to give it a try awhile back and was blown away. I never heard of this little gem hiding in Henderson. While we were waiting, it gave us a chance to look over the menu. They have a pretty good size menu from Breakfast to hearty lunch and dinner style entrees. They also have a white board with daily specials that change day to day. When we finally were able to sit down, the service started to shine. The waiter came right away and was very courteous and efficient. We already knew what we wanted since we were waiting for about 30-40 min. Was the wait worth it. I sure in the hell say YES!! Waiting for our order, I noticed the food coming out. Big hulking sandwiches piled high with Corned Beef, and other huge deli sandwiches being ordered. Matzo ball soup with asteroid size Matzo ball in the middle. My wife ordered the Homemade Corned Beef Hash plate with eggs, skillet potatoes and a fresh made Bagel with Cream Cheese. Who wants toast when you can have a fresh made bagel done the real way. The Cream Cheese was fresh and you get a big ol helping of it. The Corned Beef Hash looked heavenly. Crispy and flaky with a hint of caramelizing on the meat with an amazing blend of seasonings. The best part is that it wasn't salty like the can stuff. It was perfect as is. The bagel was fluffy and toasted just right. Just enough crunch but still kept its soft and chewy texture. I ordered the San Gennaro Omelet. Loaded with chunks of Italian Sausage, Basil, Garlic, Mozzarella Cheese, and Marinara. It wasn't sloppy and it was made flat and not folded which I liked. Made it more appealing and easier to eat. It covered the whole plate. It also came with a side of skillet potatoes and your choice of Toast or Bagel. Yeah, I went for the bagel. You can get toast anywhere lol. I had to try the bagel and glad I made that choice. I jumped in to that Omelette and was blown away. You could taste each of the ingredients and the blended together perfectly in your mouth. Normally, I scarf down my food hella quick, but this had me take my time and enjoy it. I can go on and on and there is so much to choose from. The big hulking deli sandwiches, breakfasts and lunch entrees I know Ill be back again. Plus, I know where to get some amazing bagels to go, since they have a little shop on the side to get stuff to go. The desserts they make there look amazing and I will be sure to review that when I try. Till next time..Let's Eat!!!",

    "text": "NOTE** The Yelp map location is wrong.  Weiss Deli is in the shopping center on the South East Corner of Sunset and Green Valley, NOT the North East Corner.  After trying all the famous delis (Carnegie, Stage, Canter's, etc...) in the big Casinos and noticing they are all a shadow of the originals that I love, I set out to find a real deli in Las Vegas.  Delis are best when they are being run by deli people.  And that's the problem with the casinos.  They are being run by people that don't know the difference between deli mustard and Dijon.  I'm dead serious, I once had someone at the Carnegie argue with me that grey poupon was a brown deli mustard, and my only choices were yellow and Dijon.  If they pulled that at the original Carnegie in New York , there would be a riot.  So although it's a little off the beat and path from the strip, Weiss Deli is well worth the trip.  Only in business since 2006, Owner Michael Weiss is using his Grandma's recipes.  Which explains why Weiss' tastes like it's been around for 60 years.    As I always do when trying a new deli, I went with pastrami on rye.  This is the best pastrami you'll get in Las Vegas folks.  Sure the Carnegie is starting off with a great product, but I've had it tough, cold, and sometimes they get lucky and make it right.  But from the first bite of this sandwich, I knew they were serious about how to prepare pastrami.  It was piping hot, it was perfectly steamed, it had plenty of fat on it (which adds to the flavor).  Even though it was my only time eating here, I can almost guarantee it's great every time.  The guy cures his own pastrami, enough said.  The flavor was perfect and while I might prefer Langer's in LA just a little better, this is a good 2nd.  Every bite of that sandwich was a joy to eat.  Also we need to talk about one of the most impressive rye breads that I've ever seen.  Each slice of rye is about 8 inches high and 10 inches wide.  Freshly baked on site, I'd love to see a whole loaf of that rye.  It had a nice crunchy crust, but with a rye bread that large, even with a huge pile of meat in it, the crust was almost a picture frame surrounding the delicious soft seeded rye.  Served with National Deli Mustard, I can't wait to enjoy this sandwich again.  Also not to be missed was the side of potato salad (which I couldn't keep my wife from eating - I think I only had like 2 bites of it before she claimed it as her own).  It's almost like a mashed potato salad since the potatoes are so soft and mashed together with egg and mayo.  It reminded me of the flavor of the famous Rascal House Potato Salad, and that's the highest compliment I can pay it.  The wife had \"The Remington\".  It was hot roast beef, melted swiss & cheddar jack, grilled onions, on grilled rye bread.  It was supposed to come with horseradish sauce, but she isn't a fan of that, so we went with a side of brown gravy to dip it in.  Excellent sandwich.  They messed up a little bit, since we ordered it open face (which is usually how it comes) but it was still good as a sandwich.  The roast beef was very tasty and their brown gravy outstanding.  Her side of french fries were pretty boring however, but so what, the sandwich is so large, you don't need them.  Each sandwich was served with a half a pickle and half a pickled tomato.  I wouldn't be surprised if they pickled them on site.  I also tried a combo appetizer of chopped liver and white fish salad.  What a great idea to be able to get a scoop of each right next to each other.  I was surprised it was only served on a large lettuce leaf with a black olive and a pickle spear.  It wasn't brought by our waitress, so when I asked her where all the veggies were, she was shocked that they sent it out like that.  So she rounded up some tomato and red onion.  I'm used to carrots, and cucumber, maybe bell peppers as well.  The presentation wasn't very good, but since it got messed up, I'm not sure how it's supposed to look, or what's supposed to be on it.    I preferred the white fish salad to the chopped liver.  Excellent whitefish salad!  Not too salty, nice and smokey with plenty of mayo.  The chopped liver was just ok, but still better than most places.  And last but not least, the prices.  Only $10.95 for a huge Pastrami Sandwich.  I was shocked.  For that quality and size, that's $15 anywhere else.  And if you get one at a deli on the strip, maybe it will be $20. (Of course it will have even more meat than Weiss, but you'll most likely be throwing half of it away which is a shanda).",

    "text": "10/29/11 BREAKFAST.  It greatly pains me to write this review, but here goes.  Many months ago friend Kathe took me here. She was hungry, I was not. So I had iced teas while she had a \"Black Mountain\", an eggs benedict with beef brisket instead of ham or such.  I tried her food. It was AMAZING. The brisket was a nice not-too-thin cut of beef, fatty and tasty. The poached eggs were perfect, runny inside. And that hollandaise was one of the best I had ever had. Unusual with the amount of lemon flavor, but that made it refreshing. A great plate of food.  TODAY I returned for the second and LAST time. I ordered the \"Black Mountain\". The brisket was paper thin and boring, except the fatty part. The eggs were overcooked, hard inside. The hollandaise was dull and thick, just not good at all. And my spouse, his words, had the worst omelet he has ever had in his entire life. In fact, at our table, no one really liked the food that much.  I don't know what has happened to this place, but now, sadly, it's off my list for good.  PS And the service? Well, I've read people having problems with service here, but it was half-filled with customers and the service was well-meaning and fine. A good tip was left.  PPS According to internet sources of various kinds, Weiss USED to be one of the 5 places in Vegas with the best hollandaise. Now only 4 remain:  1. Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge 2. the coffee shop @ Jerry's Nugget Casino 3. Bouchon @ Venetian 4. Verandah @ Four Seasons  Now, from that list, I've only been to the Peppermill, but not had the hollandaise. Guess I'll have to try it, next time, but I'm not a huge fan of the food there. I know nothing about Jerry's Nugget. Bouchon and Verandah have been on my \"to do\" list here since I arrived. I can believe Bouchon's hollandaise is great. And I hear the brunch @ Verandah, in general, is fantastic. Hopefully I'll get to all 4 soon.",

I ordered a sandwich and the 4 people who ordered AFTER me got their food before me.   The sandwich ingredients were good quality, but it was literally slapped together so haphazardly that it was impossible to eat. I got one with turkey and salami on it, and half of the sandwich didn't have turkey and half didn't have salami. You could just tell it was put together so carelessly, it didn't make me feel good about spending $17.  The toothpicks were stuck in sideways and defeated the purpose of having them there in the first place, and the side of fruit was dried out and gross. Like really, if you're going to only give me one strawberry among my \"side of fruit\", make sure its at least a good one.   They have a wide variety of things to choose from, but the customer service, and the way they prepared their food left me just thinking \"Meh. I've experienced better\".",

But this is Jewish home-cookin' with all the good and bad that this implies.  The various bagel and lox plates are wonderful. The latkes are just what they should be, and are served with both sour cream and apple sauce.  The omelets are huge but often kinda dull and dry.  The blintzes were the only item that I've received that I thought were a bit on the small side. But they were so rich and yummy that I was not disappointed in the end.  So, if you like Jewish soul food (and maybe a bit of bacon on the side) this is worth a try. ...and on your way out, grab a slab of noodle kugel for later.  It couldn't hurt.",

For breakfast  I had the corn beef  hash with eggs and french toast.       The corn beef was ground up and had some diced potato's in it. It was crispy and tasty, I prefer my corn beef a little chunkier but that's a personal preference.        The french toast was a couple huge slices of challah bread it was solid nothing special to me, if it was Hawaiian bread instead of challah I would, Hallah! ( I know lame)         Our next visit for lunch , wife had the Clary a triple rye sandwich filled with pastrami, corn beef , Swiss cheese ,cole slaw and Russian dressing. This huge sandwich is a winner.             I had the Ceily's stack potato latkes stuffed with braised brisket , provolone, muenster cheese and covered in brown sauce. I would have liked more brown gravy but it was pretty good, anyway, I think if you like potato latkes you would love this dish , me not a big fan of the latkes but that's personal taste.        Portions are huge, food tasty , I like this place alot.  Service was good     I",

    "text": "Brisket is often a hard meat to get right, but Weiss put a nice twist on my brisket sandwich. In NY, the brisket is often crumbly, dry and lean and excellent. In the Weiss version, it is still lean (on request), but it is braised which makes it a bit moister and delicious. It still needs 1000 island dressing, but was quite tasty.  I liked the fact that you can get 1/2 sandwich and soup ($1.25 extra for matzoh ball) if your not that hungry, but the sandwiches aren't as big as Carnegie. THe soup had its moments, but was not seasoned enough, but after tossing the dark meat out of the soup (a big No No), the soup was above average and matzoh ball was giant, but needed salt.  Only negatives were my battle with the one fly in the place that was buzzing the back of the restaurant and no free cole slaw/pickles ala NY deli's. Rye bread was fresh too. Huge menu, so must go back and try other items including a rare sighting of an Egg Cream.",

Their motzah balls come in two sizes and their soup is the best I've ever had. Extra plates are cheerfully provided (as we often divide plates so we can share more things), which brings me to one of the nicest facets of this restaurant: their waiters are the best! We were a party of six this week, with a four year old and a need on my daughter's part to get to a business meeting. When the rushed situation was explained, Jacques and another waiter served us quickly with smiles that made us feel as if we couldn't be more welcome. (My sister says Jacques gets hugs from long time customers, he's that hospitable!) I highly recommend this place--except when I'm in town! Please don't go then; my favorite pastries already sell out early!",

Sadly, we were next to a customer who was talking five times louder than a typical person, and he didn't stop for a moment to come up for air. I decided to look for another table. The restaurant has a somewhat strange configuration, and as I walked toward the front, I was entering a work zone for the wait staff. The waitress didn't bother to explain this to me, but instead gave me a death stare, and was pointing with her head that I should move to the next aisle. Her expression and body language was sending the message that I must be a total idiot for attempting to continue walking in what had been a normal pathway just a few steps before. So how is the food here? Don't know. I found the proper pathway and walked out the front door, never to return again.",

I tried to order two Reubens from the busboy and he told me Jaquise would take my order. So I sat patiently waiting. Jaquise was busy with his other tables. He passed our table at least ten times without even letting us know he would be there shortly. We sat there for twenty minutes. We felt as if we were invisible. The final straw was when a group of elderly ladies sat down and I watched him go up two minutes from the time they were seated and take there order. We up and walked out. Nobody stopped us or even said have a nice day. As I walked out I yelled BYE and nobody batted an eyelash. Very poor service. I'll never go back there again. Maybe we weren't Jewish enough.",

The potato salad is supreme!  Looks, feels and smells like Brooklyn... kind of ambiance of an East coast diner.  I eat here at least once a week.",

    "text": "Oh my lord- East coast Jewish delis are amazing, and this place can holds its own with the best of them. As soon as I saw the menu here, I started (favorably) comparing it to Miller's on Polk Street in SF, where I first had matzo ball soup.  The soup here, which we started with, is just as legit. And the portions are just as huge, too- the one pictured is a cup. It could easily be a lunch, and is served with a couple of tasty-ass bagel chips too. Rye flavor, natch.  BF opted for one of the most expensive (and largest) sandwiches ever, the JR Boucher, which is a triple-layer with pastrami and liver. Yeah, that didn't sound tasty to me at all, and it's $18. But we got it, and it's frickin' delicious: all the components work so well together, they harmonize like a choir of angels. Oh and one sandwich is easily like three meals. We shared it and still had half for dinner.  And, because I'm a total glutton and never on this side of town, I had to get my own dish, too. I got the Ceily's stack- latkes stuffed with brisket, topped with two types of cheese and brown gravy. It's even more amazing than it sounds, priced at $12, and is also easily split into thirds. Just finished my order for lunch today.  With two heavy take-out boxes in hand, we rolled ourselves out the door... And promptly axed any plans of looking for a rental property in Henderson, because I don't want to weigh 400 pounds and if this place were nearby, that might be a serious possibility.",

Well your in for a treat because the beef dip at Weiss reminds me so much of the taste of Philippes. But I like Weiss a little more because it is LOADED with a ton of beef and you get a nice big serving of aujus. Now the soup, it just soothes the soul. Just something about a homemade chicken noodle soup that really makes you feel good, this one has it! Every time I have been the service is amazing and the food even better.",

Might as well say this is on sunset vs green valley D: I was traveling east on the 215, and it had me exit off Green Valley Parkway and drive North... all the way to almost Sunset... I was like wahhhh i could have taken the airport bypass and got off on Sunset D: Save me that loop i drove =[   Located on the corner of the Trader Joe's shopping centre. Pretty easy to find. Super busy. The restaurant side was packed. As i was on the way to an appointment for work, i decided to do take out.   Overlooking the menu... quite extensive. Lots of options. As i had this place bookmarked for \"TRY THE PASTRAMI SANDWICH !!!\" ... thats what i got. Pastrami sandwich on rye bread, with a side of potato salad, and half a pickle. Little did i know how BIG these sandwiches are. Can easily match if not BEAT jason's deli sizes (and those arent small either).   Total wait time was maybe ~10 minutes. Not bad. When my order came out, the waitress asked if i wanted mustard. I told her it was my first time at the restaurant, and shes like \"yeah you are getting mustard...\" then she proceeded in telling me about these two guys who came in for the first time, about 6 months ago. Ate there, then since then, found EVERY chance to go to the restaurant and tried the ENTIRE menu. 2 guys, 2 different items each time, and shared. I'm like.... bravo... Luckily i dont live on that side of town HAHA !   Since i was on the move, i ate it while driving to my appointment. My god it was hard to eat (size issue.... yah yah -.- dirty minds). I had wished the pastrami was thick sliced like some deli's ive heard of in NY but oh well. Good flavor. Needs to be eaten asap or bottom bread gets soggy :( like all pastrami or corned beef sandwiches... Potato salad was nice. Not overly heavy. Pickle was a bit underflavored? Maybe they make it themselves. I like sourness. XD   Overall. Pretty good. Would like to come back another time and try other things !",

Only minus for me would be the tables put together so sometimes you'd be really close to another group. Guess that's expected for the whole place itself being so tiny!  Food was great! We first had the Chicken Noodle Soup with Matzo Ball. I've never had a matzo ball before, so for a first time this was delicious! Big chunks of chicken and even amounts of noodles, carrots and celery-- homemade, hearty soup!  Then we had our main dishes : I had the Pancake Breakfast - pancakes, bacon, eggs and potatoes. Pancakes were really, deliciously light! From what I was told, they make their own bacon! The little things are always a plus! Fiance had the Pastrami Sandwich. Although I had wish to have experience the full sandwich, the pieces I stole from his sandwich were sooo good!  My son had his usual, Chicken Fingers with Fries.. Huge, huge portions!  I'd def come back here again to try the rest of the menu!",

Good value too, our bill coming up to just $30. A refreshing change after being on the strip.   Tip: try Mothership Coffee Roaster just past Trader Joe's. The cortada is a very good cup of joe! For Aussies - a piccolo is more like a cappuccino here and a cortada is slightly larger than a piccolo (aka Gibraltar).",

Let me tell you the small bowl was pretty huge.  I think that would have sufficed for my entire meal.  The flavor was great and would definitely have that again.  I had also ordered the Grilled Cheese and added ham and grilled onions.   The ham and onions were an additional charge to the sandwich.  Fabulous and very tasty flavor!  I loved every bite.  Even though I was full from the soup, I couldn't stop eating the sandwich.   The grilled onions really gave it that extra umph!

Side of Smoked Fish ($6.95): Hand-sliced Nova Lox. Since I couldn't decide between corned beef hash and smoked salmon (I love both equally), I ordered a side of lox. It's a nice portion that worked well with the bagel I received with my meal and delicious.  Potato Latkes ($6.95): Grandma Ceily's recipe, served crispy with sour cream and apple sauce. These were nice though I would have preferred more seasoning. The apple sauce was great with it!  My friend had an order of pancakes and they are so fluffy and tasty!

Sounded good , buuuutttt, the meat was dry and the combined flavors left a bit to be desired , I had to ask for a side of gravy which helped it along , but not much ! (And I was left burping , the rest of the day ). It was such a shame cuz I really really wanted to like this place !! Maybe I will give it another try , but for now it has quite literally left a bad taste in my mouth !!   Side note !  On the way out I did decide to try a couple of baked goods , and choose a black and white cookie , eh ! Very cakey and although quite large , nothing to write home about , but the shining star here was the cheese Danish !! Which I had the next day , very soft and sweet pastry dough ,filled with lots of sweet and decadent cream cheese filling ! It was large and filled the whole take out container , and is easily at least 2 or 3  servings !! Absolutely sinful !! For that alone 5 stars , but my other menu items were average at best , so I'm sticking with the 3 stars ,until I go back and give this place a second try !",

I could only finish half of my sandwich. The bad thing was that after a while, it got very tiring to eat the dipped sandwich since the flavors were pretty bland. I didn't have much of an appetite to finish the rest of my sandwich either.   My boyfriend also tried their 10 oz. Burger, which he ordered medium rare but it really came out as medium. It was dry and not juicy at all. The fries were also average, nothing spectacular.  The prices are on the high end for sandwiches ($12-15). Given the lack of flavor, price, and slow service, I don't think I'll go out of my way to go back anytime soon.  But if you're into huge portions and a wide variety of sandwiches, this is the place for you.",

Its cold, unfriendly, hot and never go on Sunday. They should move to a new location and get a designer who knows how to create a beautiful inviting atmosphere, ditch the parents of the owner and continue making fabulous food. Will only do take out from here on in... from a former loyal customer. All I wanted was some chicken noodle soup for a cold and couldn't even achieve tahat as take out was so crowded with slow service. We are now at Sammys having bottomless Mimosas....way better atmosphere fast professional and friendly service!",

I was nearby since I avoided the tunnel and took surface streets, and decided to see if Weiss sold their meats by the pound rather than ordering a sandwich.  Sure enough, they do!  They sell everything: corned beef, pastrami, tongue, smoked salmon, etc - you name it.    I got 1/3 lb tongue sliced, and then I decided to order a beautiful small challah.  They slice it for free, but I kept it whole so we could rip it.  I ended up eating a few slices of tongue on the drive home, then made a small sandwich for a pre-dinner snack, and then had another one for breakfast the next day.  It tastes like childhood!  I look forward to going back for more meat or a meal soon!",

I ate it in the car with a fork while driving to a meeting.    I would have given 4 stars but was disappointed in how long it took to get an egg sandwich to go.  Both the Egg Salad and Bagels were already made - no cooking required.  The restuarant was not busy, only one other person waiting behind me.  But, it looked like they were making a lot of catering/pick-up orders which meant that it took them almost 20 minutes to put the Egg Salad on a toasted bagel.  I can understand waiting 20 minutes for a cooked-to-order egg and ham sandwich.  Fine.  But when I see the Egg Salad sitting in a bowl in the front chilled case, it shouldn't have taken so long.  The front staff seemed a bit disorganized.   I would love to go back and sit in the restaurant and try the breakfast.   This was my first visit to Weiss - which many of my friends have recommended.  I will return soon.",

Loved it.   Did the 'not too hungry' special with the chicken noodle soup + matzo ball and a pastrami sandwich. The soup was good but wasn't a wow factor for me. Personally I thought the flavor of the broth was too light. There were lots of vegetables, noodles, and chicken though which is a big bonus. The star of the soup was definitely the matzo ball. It came out super hot and was pretty much just how I expected, a fluffy dumpling. The pastrami sandwich was also THE BOMB. They give you so much meat inside the sandwich. There was no way I could've straight up taken a bite. The pastrami was very tasty and it paired well with the rye bread I got. Total for me was $10 which I thought was a very good deal considering I couldn't finish the lunch. xD  Overall, chicken noodle soup = eh Any of the sandwiches = thumbs up (since they are a deli)",

    "text": "I use to come here a lot with family and friends back when it was Samueli's. There sandwiches were the size of a small dog, the matzoh ball soup was as good as my grandmothers, and the prices weren't too bad either. What has changed? I'm happy to say just the name.  My wife is from Japan and has never had matzoh ball soup nor has never eaten in a east-coast style deli. I felt ashamed of this considering that I'm a Jewish boy from Boston. Where was my mind!? I had to correct this crime!  We got there a little bit after noon and the place was busy, but not packed, and we were promptly seated. Just sitting down you know this place is a real deli, not like one of the chain ones that popped up in the valley that feels like you are eating in an cafeteria. The sounds of dishes and silverware being banged around by the busboy, conversations drowning out the radio, the yentas in the neighboring table kvetching about their bill to the waiter, and waiters zooming around.  I decided the best option for the wife was to do the \"Not so hungry\" combo (1/2 sandwich and choice of frieds, soup, or salad) and I ordered that too. We both got matzoh ball soup (extra charge for the matzoh balls) and she got tongue while I got corned beef, both oo rye because it's only right. Of course my meal was washed down with a Doc Browns.  For a \"small soup\" it sure was filling, it had a baseball sized matzoh ball, noodles, and chunks of chicken. The soup was a bit cool when we got it, but it was served in a shallow bowl, but the matzoh ball was piping hot. The soup was garnished with two thin slices of toasted 'everything' bagels. The chicken soup here is just perfect, more sweet than salty the noodles weren't breaking apart, and of course the matzoh ball was a ball of doughy, chickeny, soupy heaven.  The menu may say \"half a sandwich\" but that's really only relative to the what they considering a normal sandwich. By size comparison I would say this would be a 6\" sub at any sub shop but with extra meat. My corned beef was stacked with care, warmed to just south of 'hot', folded over itself properly so I could sink my teeth into it versus having just a brick of meat fighting me. The rye bread is a treat on its own.   The bill came to $24, and we both were stuffed, happy, and already planning a return trip. Between the atmosphere and food it's amazing how much a meal can take you back in time and someplace else. For a brief second I thought I was going to step out onto a street in Brookline, MA.",

I went with my family and another family so we had a party of 7. They managed to accommodate us pretty quickly. The service from beginning to end wasn't bad, but it wasn't extraordinary either. At least half of our party started with the chicken noodle soup that they're famous for. I enjoyed it very much, but I did notice I had way more noodles than my boyfriends bowl. Between us we ordered an East Coast type sandwich made with Taylor Ham (a personal favorite) it was piled 4 slices high with American cheese and raw onion. Good sandwich. An order or chicken fingers, a BLT (too much L), an open faced roast beef, a burger (big but average), and a side of chicken salad. Ill go back for that chicken salad alone, it was one of the best I've ever tasted. Towards the end when we paid, we gave the waitress our bill that was only about $2 over. We were going to leave the rest and main part of her tip on the table as we collected it all. Well in the mean time she gave us dirty looks and assumed we only were leaving her that as a tip and talked smack to other employees. It was a little funny and annoying at the same time. As for a Jewish deli, ill stick to bagel cafe, but return here for Taylor ham and chicken salad Togo!",

And since I like a good deli sandwich we decided to stop and check out and see what they had. As you walk in its very hole in the wall in its decor. Pictures of menu items on the wall and that's pretty much it. This place was crazy busy. We were sat immediately and drink order taken (yay). We got the Pastrami on rye to share with fries. Sandwich was of good portion for 2 people to share. Fries were normal house fries. The meat was tender and good for any carnivore to enjoy. It did take a bit to get the attention of the staff to get a refill and our bill. They get busy and possibly understaffed. Thank you for eating at Weiss Restaurant Deli & Bakery. We will try again just to try the different sandwiches. Was not overly impressed but I did like the good, meaty sandwich. If in Henderson check it out. Good deli style meals.",

That being said, we aren't in New York for astronomical prices, nor would I like to only be able to share a meal when eating here.  Half price and half portion would be wiser.  We just don't go here because you get four meals instead of one and they just up the price.  I don't want leftovers for a week.  I want one meal. When making a lunch date I don't want to have to share and when with my husband at a diner he wants a Reuben and I do not.  Basically,  this is the long time, most  authentic New York style deli in town and they know it and are taking advantage of that.  So they haven't gotten anymore business from us.

This time I tried the chicken noodle soup and the southwest chicken with fruit as a side. The soup was real tasty with nice chunks of chicken!!  My sandwich was good but the chicken was a little plain.  My friend got the chicken Marsala special and said it was good.  My bf got the top sirloin special and said it was ok. I tried a bite of his roasted potatoes and they were great.",

I didn't try the bakery, but I'd like to next time.  The menu definitely has a lot of options I'd be willing to try again.  Service was OK.  Our waiter definitely wasn't bubbly or energetic or even peppy.  However, he didn't mess up our order and was friendly enough.    Atmosphere is probably the weakest part.  Walls are a plain white with only pictures of their own food in framed photos throughout.  The wall dividers in the main dining area seemed off; hard to explain without visuals, but it felt like being closed in.  Place wasn't completely clean; noticed dust or drywall bits on a nearby booth and vents looked dirty.  It just wasn't inviting.  Overall, the place isn't bad, but it wasn't as memorable as other delis (Jewish or not) I've been to before.",

    "text": "There are 5 simple reasons why this place gets 5/5 stars AND is a place you should stop into:  #1: DELICIOUSNESS.  This place has great food! I am a huge fan of Nova lox, and this is the best in the Vegas area. Their sandwiches are good (corned beef...yuummmm), their breakfast menu is good (oatmeal is fantastic), and their bagels are fresh and flavorful!   #2: HUMONGOUS PORTIONS. You ever walk into a place and pay $12 for a sandwich, have it put in front of you, and wonder \"How in the hell can that sandwich have actually costed me $12?\" Well, you think that same thing when you come here...only for the opposite reason. You start trying to figure out how then can squeeze so much meat into the sandwich and still make a profit! (And quality cuts of meat at that!)  #3: FRIENDLY STAFF The staff is always friendly here. I have yet to come across a server that is unfriendly (unlike a number of other delis I have been to where it seems like sometimes you are there to serve the waitress. Not like that here!) You can tell that this place is packed full of regulars because you often hear the customer and waiter/waitress call each other by their names. (That is usually the best sign of a good restaurant.)  #4: PICKLES Lots of pickles. Delicious pickles. And they're free pickles. What's not to love about that?!  #5: BAKED GOODS Their baked goods, in addition to their great bagels, are fantastic. Personally, I never come here without getting some rugelakh and half&half cookie.",

With country fried potatoes seasoned and they are extra tasty. Also comes with any bagel and huge cup of cream cheese. All for 4.95 + .95   Then it's mandatory to get a small bowl of the absolute BEST chicken noodle soup on the planet ( just don't say that to your mom ) but it rocks! Service is pretty good but don't expect gourmet because it's a deli style place. Always a good experience here. Food is always very good.",

We asked for suggestions, and while the great sandwich debate of 2015 ACTUALLY ended in a showdown about homemade/vs restaurant sandwiches, and someone getting mad that we don't subscribe to the \"Get in the kitchen and make me a sammich\" mentality...we DID get some good restaurant suggestions, and Weiss was one of them.  We found ourselves on this side of town on Saturday, after a movie, and even though we had eaten a HUGE breakfast AND popcorn...we had to stop in.  When I was younger, my mom used to make \"Jewish Penicillin\"...aka Matzoh ball soup. I saw that this was on the menu, and I almost died.    We ordered a whole pastrami on rye, and a SMALL cup of the chicken noodle with matzoh balls.    Holy generous portions, Batman.   For real, this sandwich was as big as my head.  Fella and I split it, and I STILL couldn't eat the whole thing.  Huge, heaping portions of flavorful pastrami and delicious rye bread...they offered standard yellow mustard, and whole grain mustard (of course I used whole grain). This sandwich was perfection.  The soup made me cry.  It tasted JUST like my Uncle Sherwin's recipe that my mom used to make when I was younger.  I haven't had matzoh ball soup in probably 20 years.  It was amazing.   Service was super polite.    I will DEFINITELY be going back to try some other offerings!",

The challa  bread French toast is pretty great too. It's a little cramped but comfortable and clean. It's definitely in my top 4 breakfast spots in Henderson. It's not fancy but your tastebuds will be happy.",

My friend and I really enjoy Lox and bagels, so we figured we'd try it here with their whitefish salad and we were not disappointed!!! We got 2 everything bagels, plenty of smoked salmon, whitefish salad, onions, capers, a pickled green tomato, a crisp pickle, and smooth cream cheese for about $20. They're servings are very large, so 2 people can definitely share and get full. Their chicken noodle and their matzo ball soups are amazing! Their brownies are toe curling goodness. Their rugelachs are delicious!  The service here is always good, even when they're busy...and they're always busy!",

The menu here has far more options than I ever expected. They have a large selection of sandwiches and various types of fish. In the take-out area I noticed they even have stuffed cabbage, chili, and other delicious foods.   I had half of a sandwich with matzoh ball soup. My husband had the Beach Club. The portions on both were huge, we could have definitely split the full sandwich. The matzoh ball soup blew my mind and nipped an almost cold in the bud. The rye bread on the sandwiches was SO good! I could tell the difference between their rye and something I would buy at the grocery store. We also had a pastry that was buttery and tasty.   Pricing seemed reasonable for a deli and portions were very generous. I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.",

The server was nasty (sighing and eye-rolling), and I asked him if were annoying him, and he responded saying, just tell me what you want so I only have to make one trip to this table. We were missing a dish we ordered, knives and butter. The Reuben's look nothing like the photo. The chicken breast was overcooked (charred and very dry) and barely edible. We didn't dare complain ... because ... He was around the corner from where we were sitting talking about us and laughing with 2 other boys. They were also hitting one another with menus, and their language was awful... such as yelling \"F***ing A!\" loud enough for customers to hear.  It seems asking for butter was cutting into his play time. Before I got a bite into my sandwich, they turned over chairs on top of the table immediately next to us.  Obviously the restaurant owners were not present. Even if not for the abusive server, the food wasn't good enough.",

    "text": "After a long time being away, we were both looking forward to breakfast here. We love the Farmers Hash with all of its veggies and melted cheese on top. We split this meal, as it is a really good size. We chose the sesame bagel, and it comes with a generous portion of cream cheese on the side.   Well, this time was really disappointing. They have changed the interior from the last time we were here. They have put up these 3/4 walls along the front and side of the dining area. This has created no room to move around. We had to stand in between tables and wait while a waiter took an order, all while on our way to be seated.   When we got to our table, it was only a two-top and was crammed with condiments of all kinds. Our table was just far enough away from the tables on either side of us so that you could squeeze by and sit on the bench. I didn't like this at all. No privacy at all. We got to listen to both conversations next to us.   Our service was not the greatest. The servers were so busy that we felt ignored. The food was pretty good though. That was the only good part. What did come back to me was that there is always the lingering odor of burned toast/bagels. I don't know if they need to clean their toaster, or turn down the heat...but it was unpleasant. Today was especially bad. The table next to us got toast, and I'll just say that it was very well done. Eww.   We had a hard time leaving as well, since a table on one side was just being seated. Won't be coming back here to dine in. Might stop for bagels to go, as that entrance is off to the side and their bagels are tasty. The burnt toast smell is bad, service is mediocre and it is way too congested in there.",

The staff is always very nice and helpful however they are always rotating in new young people. They have Deli and bakery items as well as the classic New York style lunch offerings. Pickles are made in house based on the taste of them, and they have delicious pickled tomatoes as well. So far I've had their pastrami, turkey melt, and chicken soup and they've all been very satisfying. The only reason for no five stars is that it just seems like there could be a bit more room for improvement on server training. Seems like we get the wrong sides every time we go.",

I came in around 10 min after 8 (they open at 8AM) and was seated immediately. My drink order was quickly taken (coffee) and was brought out moments later. The staff consistently stopped by to offer a re-fill whenever I was in need. After scanning the menu I decided on the farmers market with over-medium eggs, fresh fruit (great option guys), and an egg bagel recommended by my waitress. The homey decor and mom and pop ambience made for a pleasant/comforting wait. Various travel photos are hung on the walls throughout the shop, providing me a welcome distraction as my breakfast was prepared.  My food arrived in a timely manner and it was absolutely delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly (IMO the best over-medium in town) and the swiss cheese (I subbed it in) over the hash was a great compliment to the dish. The egg bagel was tasty with a texture that was dense yet soft with a slight chew, the cream cheese was not over powering, and the subtle flavor was very good. My fresh fruit included 2 slices of cantaloupe, a strawberry, and an orange, a nice refreshing way to finish a great meal. Thanks to the Weiss family for a great dining experience. Here's to many more",

I was in Henderson a few years back and searching for a break from my usual eat spots and read several positive reviews for Weiss and decided to give it a try. Since that fateful day I have been there approximately twenty times and it has been consistently outstandng. My favorite menu item is the pancake breakfast. The price is exceptionally reasonable as compared to other breakfast places in Las Vegas and Henderson. The eggs, I prefer scrambled, are always light, fluffy, and delicious. The bacon is crisp but not burnt, and the pancakes are fluffy and simply divine! Another go to menu choice for me is the soup and a half sandwich. The chicken soup is among the best I have had in Las Vegas/Henderson. Do yourself a favor and give Weiss deli a try you will be glad you did!",

I was in need of some bagel love in honor of National Bagel Day and the sadly the hot bagel spots are lacking in Henderson... on to Green Valley!   I went with the, \"The Bomb\" bagel sandwich on an everything bagel and the layers of love never seemed to end on this heavenly sandwich. Get this... A three egg western omelet sitting atop a mountain of hash browns, bacon, and cheese fully surrounded by a massive everything bagel. This was a Viking sized breakfast that also became part of my lunch later in the day.   The bagels at Weiss are always warm, fluffy, and come with a light toast on them for that perfect crunch. The omelet was filled with flavor from both the ham and peppers, plus the added pile of hash brown was just the extra carb push I needed to get the day started off right. This is a solid tribute to the massive bagels of New York.   The weekend can get packed here so you're better off waiting until around noon or 1pm to cruise in for those weekend snack excursions.",

My order was taken quick, food delivered about 15 minutes later. Service was fair, a little slow but understandable with the crowd.  Tables are tight inside, so you can hear lots of conversation. Off to one side is the bakery, but I didn't look at what was available.  Lots of people ordering the chicken noodle soup with matzah ball so it must be a favorite. Looked pretty good. I went with a standard breakfast fare of eggs, bacon, fruit, and a garlic bagel with cream cheese. The bagel was ok, heavy on the garlic flavor to the point I couldn't finish it. Bacon was nice thick strips and 4 of them so good portion there.   Overall, just an average meal for $11. I'd come back to try the pancakes as those looked delicious.",

We seated ourselves and someone came by to grab our drinks and we were already ready to order ( I really wanted a French dip and I heard that the ones here are good ). The busser grabbed our server and she came right by to get our order. I didn't catch her name but she was really sweet! Our food was out in no time...and it was huge!!! I was not expecting the sandwich to be that big. It was also on a roll which was different but I thought it was neat! I added onions to it which made it so much better (I love grilled onions on my sandwiches). When I dipped it in the au jus sauce I noticed it kinda had a funky taste. It was very yummy but the au jus sauce was a little bit different than what I'm normally used to. It wasn't terrible though! They really do stuff the sandwich with meat, so much I might ask if they can do light meat next time! anyhow, I enjoyed the vibe that was in there and I will most likely be back! :)",

    "text": "After a horrible experience at Bagel Cafe in Vegas, I can't even say how grateful I am to have stumbled on this place. I grew up in New York/Philly and have lived in Chicago so I've eaten some top-notch Jewish food and know the real deal when I see it. My standards are extremely high I admit. Even though it's 30 min from where I live, I would drive here 3x a week or more for the food. It's a little, unassuming hole in the wall by Trader Joe's that I've actually missed seeing before while in this shopping center. First glance at the menu I was a little surprised at the prices, but after eating there last night I totally get it.  First off, the chicken matzoh ball soup is like grandma used to make. Not too salty but flavorful, I like their take on it with the small noodles, not egg noodles. A lot of white meat chicken floating around in it. The matzoh ball was the size of a small baseball, easily enough for 2 or 3 to share. Perfect density, not chewy but firm and well seasoned, unlike the swill that passes for soup at TBC.  It was a trough sized bowl to boot, easily enough to make 2 meals out of by itself. My gf and I made the rookie mistake of ordering 2 sandwich platters. Omg I've never seen a triple-decker sandwich that size before at any Jewish deli. It's basically 2 sandwiches for the price of one, so any objections I may have had to the price was put to rest. It was awesome, good quality corned beef, turkey and swiss on marble rye. So good! We'll probably be sharing from here on out.  The service was excellent, the opposite of what you normally get at TLC. We sat down and were acknowledged immediately, and I think Jacques was our server. Super friendly, he hooked us up with an extra matzoh ball when we left for no charge. This place knows what service is all about. Fortunately, they had lox/whitefish and all the trimmings to go in a little take-out nook in the corner of the restaurant. This is when it gets real for me - good nova lox and whitefish salad to take home and make my own sandwiches with is no joke - I take my Sunday brunches with good friends and better Jewish food very seriously.  They knocked it out of the park! It's so hard to find whitefish salad that isn't too greasy or over-loaded with mayo - it's perfect. Creamy and super-delish. The chunk whitefish is just as good and the homemade nova lox cream cheese was superb. The prices are on par with any major city and well worth it to me.  I normally spend lots of time and $ digging up every Jewish deli I can find when I move to a new place, Jewish food is pretty much a staple for me. I can say that my search is over, I don't need to go anywhere else. I would drive an hour to get here if I had to. They could compete in cities like Chicago or Philly with their food. The owner Michael was a great guy, I chatted with him for a few minutes before I left to thank him for the experience. I can't wait to go back and try the breakfast specials and especially the potato pancakes - if they are what I think they'll be I'll be a fan and customer for life. Kudos Weiss Deli!!",

Ok so the feel of this place is old as in you need to update this place..its dated badly...im ok with it but it could definetly use an updating. the entry and the entrance to the eating area and deli counter are too tight for a wheel chair. But,in any event i wasnt here to rate the decor if the food is good im down with it...my dad had the chicken noodle soup..i had some too was good a bit bland but a little salt and pepper and it was good to go..he also had a dinner salad which looked good fresh and plenty of food. I had the patty melt and this was outstanding huge serving,ample meat..a classic..had some fries with it they were normal nothing spectacualar. i was given a new pickle which i hate so i asked for old..good old pickles need a snap..these were really bad and soggy to me its just poor quality control to serve that to anyone ...i would nevber serve that at my restaurant..horrible. i got some whitefish salad and some danish to go..the whitefish salad is great but the danish is super ridiculous size..who eats that much danish in one sitting..its a diabetic special....parking was easy but as i mentioned its too far to go back with any regularity..but if i lived on that side of town i would probably go regularly as they are the only deli that i know of on that side of town.",

The problem was that though there were several empty tables, most were not clean.  Neither were the floors.  The table we selected had been wiped down but there was a 1/3 of the lower half of a bagel in front of it on the floor.  Elsewhere on the floors were discarded sugar packets and straw wrappers.  The bathroom stored much of the cleaning supplies and smelled terrible.   Our server was very good.  Took a few minutes to arrive, but was friendly and attentive.  Drinks were refilled timely, our bill was presented at the correct time, and he was gracious and helpful. The food was rather bland.  I had a classic turkey club, but all I could taste was the turkey.  The bacon, tomato and rye bread flavors were no where to be found, yet all were easily identifiable, so it's not like they skimped. If not for the cleanliness, I'd give it another try, but if the front of the house is messy, imagine what the back looks like.  One and done for me.",

Weiss had been on my radar for a while, so when she suggested we meet there I was excited to finally see if it lived up to the hype.   I ordered a pretty basic breakfast that came with eggs, potatoes and bacon, and we also decided to share an everything bagel. I have had some good bagels in my day... when I first started dating my husband he worked for a man that had relocated his bagel shop from New York City to Arizona, and I ate man, MANY bagels from that shop. The everything bagel we had at Weiss was, without a doubt, the best bagel I have had in Vegas.  My only real complaint about Weiss was the service, it super spotty. I asked for more half and half for my coffee... Our waitress came back 5 minutes later to see how we were doing, empty handed. So I asked again.   Despite the so-so service the food was fantastic. Great breakfast potatoes and the bacon was cooked perfectly. And that bagel, so good!!   Weiss has definitely lived up to the hype thus far, next time I will be sure to go for lunch so I can try the soup I have heard such wonderful things about!",

It's in the corner of the shopping plaza almost hiding. This place is the real deal Jewish deli. Harries has nothing on this place. It was mid morning when we came in, we were seated right away and recieved breakfast menus. I didn't come for breakfast I came for on thing in particular and that was the famous chicken noodle soup. I asked the server if they had it and she said yes so she brought me a lunch menu. It's available early if you ask for it. I ordered the chicken noodle soup on a combo with a half corned beef sandwich on rye. The fiance ordered the corned beef hash breakfast with potatoes and eggs. I received my chicken soup first then we got the rest of our order a few minutes later. The soup was perfection. The broth had deep chicken flavor the veggies cooked just right and the noodles were thinner than angel hair which is my favorite pasta. The matzoh ball had no flavor and I didn't enjoy it at all. Save the $2.00 and use it for something else unless you like matzoh balls didn't have any taste whatsoever. The corned beef was very good but the bread was too soft. Almost mushy so next time I know to have the bread toasted. The corned beef hash was very good as well, eggs cooked perfectly with runny insides just as asked. Service was pretty good but they took forever to bring the bill after we asked for it. I would definitely come back that soup was so comforting and delicious. I just wished I knew it was this close to me.",

    "text": "This place has the best chicken soup ever! It's authentic New York Jewish deli food. We arrived a little after noon and the entire restaurant was jam packed.   We both ordered chocolate egg creams, they were delish! The only bad part is that they don't give you a gallon sized glass.. ;-)  All three of us opted for the half sandwich and cup of soup. Their portions are huge! I ordered a half of a bagel, they served a whole bagel as a \"half portion\"... Superb!   The half portion of chicken soup is a full bowl. It comes out really hot too. Their matzoh balls are softball size.   The prices are very fair considering the portion size. My daughter ordered a hot dog-- it was a 1/4lb! They serve Hebrew national brand, yummy!   I can't wait to go back! 5 stars!",

Luckily, we were a party of 5 so it allowed us to order and try more items. I had Ciely's Stack with the brown gravy on the side. It was so yum and the thing was huge! The braised brisket wasn't dry and the combo of flavors from top to bottom totally hit the spot. (Gravy on the side allowed us to use it for our fries too. Yum!)  We also ordered a French toast that exceeded my expectations. (I love FT but rarely order it as I'm normally disappointed. But not here! I would totally order it again here!)  The Remington was great too. Loved the salted cucumber that came with the sandwich. The layers of flavor starting with rye to horseradish to roast beef and the cheese and onions makes for a party in your mouth!  We're definitely adding this place to our list of \"off strip dinings\" to recommend to friends and coming back, for sure!",

So my guy and I had to do it, and each picked a special. My guy had the Eggs Bradley which was like a variation of a benedict and the home fries as his side. He cleaned his plate, so I'm guessing he enjoyed his food. LOL! I had the fresh blueberry challah french toast special.  My portion was huge! Everyone around us commented on it. The guys at the table next to us laughed and said \"Good luck with that!\"  It was super tasty and I loved the fresh blueberries.  And btw, I ALMOST finished the whole thing. We enjoyed this local place in Henderson for sure and next time we'll be back with friends.",

I knew once we got our coffee that we had chosen a good place, they have really good plain ol' coffee (a sure sign of a good breakfast spot). I had the stack (combo of an omelette & hash), which was delicious, but my dining partner had the silver sandwich and it was AMAZING. Their sandwiches are a little pricey ($16 or $17 for the silver) but it was worth every penny - we even had leftovers, a rare occasion.  I enjoyed looking at everyone else's food going by - the pancakes looked wonderful as did the matzo ball soup and french toast. Even their salads looked plentiful and delicious.",

They have a brisket eggs Benedict that is really good but I prefer corn beef hash on my eggs Benedict and they made it for me special. It may have been the most tasty eggs Benedict I ever had. They also have the best bagel sandwiches that I've ever experienced. I would recommend trying the pork roll breakfast sandwich as it's a combination of ham and salami with egg and cheese and will probably fill you up for the day. It's just crazy crazy good... I go here with a friend of mine pretty regularly and we just love this place",

Wowsers!  That's exactly what happened to us. And we weren't even there for 25mins at that point. The impressive waitperson-to-table ratio makes this a turn-and-burn establishment that clearly does not want you to linger. Eat and run, or else!  I guess that's OK because Weiss's 1970s decor, cramped booths and low ceilings do not inspire a lengthy meal anyways. You get the feeling that by 9AM the rent has been paid; the rest is gravy.  Feeling 3-star-nice because the food was pretty good. But it's True that bad service keeps you from going back. Too bad - when we're recording at the studio on East Sunset Road, we're there for 3 or 4 days in a row for at least 2 meals each day. Still looking for our go-to spot in that neighborhood!",

    "text": "I remember when a couple of other businesses occupied this location that Weiss Deli is at so I was skeptical about if Weiss was like them or not. The reviews and delicious pictures on yelp got my to finally try this Jewish deli. It is tucked in the corner of a shopping center. They have a decent amount of tables and chairs outside if eating outdoors is your thing. Inside is clean, but the decor is dated. The booth I sat at had gashes in the seat. The inside isn't very big so I imagine trying to eat here on the weekend is a zoo. When you walk inside towards the left they have bagels & pastries for sale. I took a look but the case was empty and I was told by our server that they sell out quick in the mornings. They have a board when you enter that tells you what specials are going on that day.  They have a section on the menu that says \"not so hungry\" for those feeling like they can't tackle a whole sandwich themselves. You get 1/2 of a sandwich (your choice from the sandwich station area on the menu) and your choice of either a cup of soup, fries, coleslaw,  potato salad or fresh fruit on the side. I decided to order this priced at $9.95 and I can assure you that you do need to be hungry unlike the menu claims because the portions are generous. I decided to try the \"Chicken Noodle Soup\" and it was the best I have e-v-e-r had in my life! It was hardly a cup like the menu suggests and was filling all by itself. I could just sip on the broth for days! The soup had a couple bagel chips on the side that had such a nice garlic flavor. For my sandwich I went with the \"Roast Turkey\" on challah bread. The 1/2 sandwich was so big that I had to cut it in half just to eat it. The bread was seriously delicious!  I could only eat a portion of my sandwich and took the rest home for later. My hubby ordered a \"Pastrami Burger\" priced at $9.95 that came with a side of fries. He said the pastrami had good flavor.   I saw on the menu they offer catering.   The next time I stop in I will be trying out something from their tasty looking breakfast menu. I would stop in when working on this side of town just to get some of the soup to-go!",

    "text": "My dad is obsessed with finding a good Jewish deli; in his world that means chicken noodle soup, a corned beef sandwich, and real raw horseradish - none of that inferior creamy stuff.  Every time we're in Vegas together, I humor him by yelping \"deli,\" never expecting to find anything worth trying out.  Imagine my surprise when Weiss popped up in my results...   Curious but not expecting too much, we hopped in the car and drove over.  My skepticism proved to be no match for this deli - we all walked away pleasantly surprised and with full bellies.  Service was excellent - honestly one of the most professional and efficient, not to mention genuinely nicest waiters I've ever interacted with.    The portions are HUGE.  A bowl of soup could feed all of Boulder City.  So much real chicken, veggies, and super thin noodles, make this a hearty and yummy start to a meal.  The bagel chips that are served with the soup were delightfully crunchy and included a big variety of flavors (plain, pumpernickel, everything, etc).  Only complaint on the soup is that my mom's and my matzo balls were really soggy, like maybe they were undercooked or left in the broth for way too long.    The corned beef sandwich was very large - tons of meat, on seemingly homemade rye bread that was super tasty but could have been toasted a little more to provide a more solid structure to house the meat. The meat had great flavor; for my taste it could have been a bit leaner or more cleanly trimmed of fat, but I am extraordinarily picky about that - for most people, the way they serve it will be perfectly fine.    The best part?  Raw horseradish!   One suggestion?  More pickles!  One pickle per person does not a deli make!  I'm kidding, this place is definitely living up to its Delicatessen name.   But I'm serious about more pickles.",

I posted on FB bc I had a bad hankering for a great roast beef sandwich - I had multiple people tell me to come here, so my wife left the gym tonight at 5:50 by our house and asked me to call in our order while she drove the 20 minutes to pick up the food. After calling (literally) 25 times in a matter of 10 minutes and getting the answering machine that said to call back, I let my wife know I couldn't get ahold of them. She decided to keep driving and just order before the restaurant closed at 6:30. She called me very disappointed at 6:18 and said the girls at the counter just got the phones fixed and that the kitchen closed at 6:15 and they wouldn't cook us anything. Apparently the lady in front of my wife was livid...Usually when a place closes at a certain time they take orders until that time, but hey such is life. I wish we would have reached them on the phone at 6 to put the order in, but that was beyond our control tonight as well. We had planned on taking the night off cooking but that didn't happen...can't wait to try this place.",

    "text": "Right now the \"Jewish Deli\" is monopolized by the hotels on the strip, and as a local, why would you want to go down there? Especially on a weekend! What to navigate taxi cabs and pedestrians to park in a massive garage and walk a mile to the restaurant? Battle through the smoke filled casino to wait in line with tourists to get a sandwich? No way.  This deli is really traditional. It has all your basics, big sandwiches, ethnic food, Dr Browns soda, soups, etc. It's even good for breakfast, but there are tons of breakfast places so just save this place for lunch or a real early dinner (since they close early). Even if you're \"all Americana\" you can get some plain Jane sandwiches or a burger, but you should expand your horizons and get at least some pastrami.  The place gets packed on the weekend lunch hour. Not too bad, but if you're in a group larger than 4 you may have a wait. Portions are huge for the price, which is good, unless you are looking to slim down.  The only negative is the bakery inside. The cookiees and pastries are really expensive. I bought 3 small cookiees and the price was almost $8, compared to my entire lunch which was only $15! The 3 cookiees weren't even that tasty.  Skip the bakery, come hungry, leave happy.",

There is normally a wait when I've gone (both on weekends granted) but the service is speedy and they turn everyone pretty fast.   The sandwiches are better than your average deli but priced really well for the portion and the sit down nature. I've gotten an open faced turkey as well as a bagel brisket. Both were very good, however a slightly different style than I'm normally accustomed to, thus the 4 stars.   I normally grab a giant dessert from the to-go counter on the way out. You can't go wrong with a black/white cookie or a chocolate covered brownie.   If you want a homestyle place to eat, perfect for lunch, Weiss is your spot!",

    "text": "This review is specifically for the service. We had some pretty terrible service from this mid-40s waitress whom seemed pretty annoyed to serve us (lady with blonde hair and highlights). There were 4 staff members on the floor: one bus boy, mean waitress, and 2 other girls (doing nothing, but chatting and writing things on boards).  My boyfriend and went went for a quick early dinner/snack prior to a basketball game later that evening. We arrived and it was empty except for one table which had already been served. Upon arrival, you are asked to seat yourself and grab your own menu. we sat at the booth closest to the entrance. We sat down and about 5 minutes later other guests arrive (about 3 other tables). We waited patiently as the waitress helped them out first (even though we arrived way earlier). A bus boy comes by and offers us drinks prior to our waitress arriving to us. He brings the drinks drops them and leaves. The waitress is literally taking orders from the tables right behind us from top to bottom and decides to skip us disappearing into the bar where you can't grab her attention or make eye contact. All this meanwhile we are obviously trying to catch someone's attention. In the meantime, these other two (waitresses? Idk) are just chit chatting their life away ignoring customers. We wait for another 10 minutes (a total of 15 now) The bus boy is thankfully making rounds and we call him over to let him know we had been ready to order for a while now. Bus boy tells us that he will let the waiter know , but he can't take orders.  Seriously..... what type of service is this. Anyway the waitress finally makes her way around to us 5 min after we had let the bus boy know. Takes our orders in the most (i don't want to be here type of manner) and leaves. Our food arrives and she serves me my chicken soup and later returns with my boyfriend's order. She throws the plate of food onto the table, drops a fry, and does not even apologize for dropping people's food then leaves. Later during our meal she does this walk-by asking \"Is everything ok?\" does not wait for our answer and leaves. Throughout our meal, we can hear her and the other 2 girls chit chatting the whole while. At the end of our meal we again have to attempt to hunt down some service staff because no one is in sight. There is no bus boy or waitress on the floor. We waited for what seems like 10 minutes and the bus boy arrives is making rounds again. We signal for the check, he brings it, and then leaves. We are in a hurry now because what seemed like plenty of time to grab some food is now-RUNNING LATE. in the meantime, the waitress is still not in sight. we have to signal the bus boy to take our check and payment. He brings back the receipt for signature without a pen. Still no waitress around. I hunt down a pen from the table the poster girls were using and use that to get done with my check.  We did not notice this type of service to the other customers.  I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt that this wasn't the case but we honestly felt racially descriminated against by the waitress.   Otherwise food is pretty good!   MESSAGE TO OWNER: service staff needs to be trained on what customer service is, unless this is the type of service your business is used to. We thought maybe people in Nevada are like this, but went around to other restaurants and did not experience this type of ratchetness.",

We were clearly a huge inconvenience to our server.  Lucky for him Weiss must add gratuity automatically at 7 people so he didn't have to worry about ever returning to the table.  All I can say is if you go, sit inside and request anyone other than the skinny kid in the UNLV hat.  Makes me embarrassed to be a Rebel!",

    "text": "Good for dining in. Do NOT try to order through a 3rd party delivery service. I ordered a pint of chicken noodle soup, not a single noodle in the pint. I ordered a whole sandwich with a side of potato salad, no potato salad. I ordered the potato pancakes (2) option though the Postmates app, I got one potato pancake. I called to inquire what happened to my order. I was met with accusatory tones, \"you didn't get the potato salad?\" \"There's only 1 potato pancake per order.\" I tried to explain that on Postmates it said the order comes with 2, which I'd think any normal response would be that they would get that corrected with Postmates. Or at least for someone to offer a genuine apology for the bad experience. I did receive one, it was so thick with annoyance and sarcasm it poured out the receiver of my phone. HORRIBLE customer service skills here. I wasn't expecting someone to hop in their car and deliver me noodles and potato salad, but I was expecting someone at least pretend like they'd follow up with whoever put my order together and let them know to get their stuff together. Such a bummer because the chicken soup is so good, but it puts a terrible taste in my mouth for future dining in visits. I'll never understand why a restaurant can't appreciate their customers, like they don't need any to stay open.",

And the last time I went in the restaurant they said I could not order eggs but they could make me an Omelette for $16. OK, why not scrambled eggs then? Nope, Omelette or GTFO was basically our ultimatum based on our server's body language (hands on hips and all!). She never even went back to ask since it was barely after they stopped serving breakfast. I've had many Omelettes in my day, but I aint never had no $16 Omelette before.It was huge I'll give it that, but it did pay for the whole case of eggs so...........  Been going for years, tip really good too. But I guess they make too much money to keep people happy.",
