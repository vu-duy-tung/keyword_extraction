Well, the Mezzo did not disappoint! The bread was warm and the dinner was delicious. We order the fried calamari and the grilled vegetables as appetizers. We enjoyed the calamari and the grilled veggies were amazing! We were actually full just after eating the appetizers! We had chicken picatta and the Chilean seabass as our entrees. The chicken was served over pasta and it was a huge portion. The seabass was fresh and served over risotto. We also had two glasses of pinot with our meal. All of this for $100 (including a 20% tip). We will definitely return.",

I had driven by many times but never had time to have a meal til last night.  The place was very cozy and nicely decorated. The waiter that seated us was very cordial. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. There was no children's menu but she suggested smaller options of pasta dishes for my picky 2 yr old and put in his order right away. The portion was very generous and tasted awesome. My son loved it and he doesn't like much.  My choice was the chicken parmesan and my daughter ordered the lasagne. The food was fresh/hot and very visually appealing. Our portions were huge and delicious! Some of the best \"American Italian\" food I've ever had. The bread that accompanied our meals was delicious as well and out glasses were never empty.   If I had to pick anything wrong it would be the fact that the oil and vinegar for the bread came in a small dish instead of on a plate which made it difficult to get to the vinegar with out saturating your bread with oil. Simple solution.... ask for it on a plate ;-)  Overall I had a very enjoyable dining experience with my family and willdefinitely be back.",

I love the atmosphere and it is a sit down restaurant if you want food fast, maybe go to a fast food place? I like that my food is made to order vs mass production.

It feels intimate and sets the mood perfectly for a romantic date or night out. Mezzo is like this hidden local gem that you find in a totally unexpected place.  I'm not gonna lie, there was a stretch where my husband and I visited Mezzo once a month. My husband loves his Tuscan Tenderloin ($19) so much, he declared that it was his favorite meal ever. I myself prefer the Vegetable Lasagna ($15). It's loaded with squash, mushrooms, zucchini, and asparagus to name a few ingredients. More importantly, the Vegetable Lasagna is just dripping with cheese. Few Italian restaurants make a vegetarian lasagna (at least to my liking), so I have to get it while it's hot! I'd also highly recommend the Insalata Salad ($5). It's huge, fresh, and unique.   As much as I'd like to give Mezzo 5 stars, I have to knock 'em down by one due to service. The service is inconsistent at Mezzo and your experience depends on which waiter you get. Joe is the best waiter at Mezzo - he's friendly, attentive, and has memorized our order since we're regulars. I've learned to ask for Joe when we come in, so word to the wise, make sure you do the same!   Mezzo is a great local restaurant that has outstanding food and great ambiance. Do yourself a favor and eat here.",

Good lunch menu available daily. Only reason for only 4 stars is the iced tea isn't fresh, it's from a soda dispenser (Lipton?); better than instant, but disappointing. We will be back to try dinner.",

We will be going back soon for another super dinner or they serve lunch too. Say hi to Kelly & Sean & relax and wait for your meal to get there. You will not be sorry.",

Great place, would have given it five stars if they had a full liquor license but they serve beer and wine only. Traditional Italian atmosphere is a nice touch.",

It was actually pretty steady in there, lots of other were families eating as well. It's a perfect sized restaurant-not too big and not too small. It's great because you can also sit outside and eat, there's a family room and a nice bar area. Overall the setting was very intimate and romantic. If you are a wine person I would suggest going here, seems like they had lots of different wines to choose from. It was a water and Sprite night for us. They do provide you with warm bread, oil and vinegar.   Babe ordered the Caesar Salad, and it was a good portion but pointed out that there were only two Grape tomatoes in it. She also ordered the Baked Ziti which looked really good. (we noticed the couple next to us both ordered it) I got the Chicken Parmesan which comes with a side pasta. I really thought it was a small serving but ha, couldn't even finish it. The prices were not bad, we'll usually spend 40-50 dollars on a good night and we loved it here. Kelly was very nice but damn was she busy that night! She definitely was doing 3-4 different jobs, and it seemed like she was waiting on every table. Food was great, parking was easy, simple to find and get to, we would definitely go back.",

Had a blond female server, she was very friendly and helpful. We used a $30 credit.

The hanger steak with frites was AWESOME. Tender, flavorful and perfect. The Chicken Parm was delicious. Tender, juicy, crispy.  Sauce was a nice, simple, marinara that didn't overwhelm.  We brought some to-gos (eggplant parm and caprese salad) back to the office and everyone raved. Would be perfect for a date-night.",

It was 6:30pm on a Monday night for a party of five.  The street appeal is awesome and even when you walk in the place is warm and inviting.  That is where the positive remarks end.  I walk in first to find a server with his back to me, lighting candles at the hostess stand.  About a minute goes by before he turns his head slightly and says, \"it'll be a moment\".  Okay we say. About a minute later, we are seated at a table just a couple of feet away. And we wait.  Finally we are approached and asked what drinks we would like. Three ice teas, a diet and a root beer.  And we wait.  And wait. So finally our drinks come and they are handed out right over my shoulder, to everyone.  If I was at a bar paying $10 a plate, that's no biggie,BUT I wasn't.  He leaves and we wait some more. One sip of my ice tea and I realize it's not even fresh brewed.  Sigh.  So about twenty minutes go by and I watch three different servers flutter around but none come by to us.  I finally stop one as he walks by us to great a couple at the door.  I ask for  some service and he says he's new and will find someone.  Less than a minute later, someone is standing in front of us with a pen poised and irritated.  So I tell him that It's our first time there, it's my birthday and so far I'm not impressed at all.  Boxed tea, no bread (it's an Italian restaurant for God sake!) and no True welcome and introduction to the place.  I'm told there's no manager on duty before I even ask for one.  So I ask him directly, \"Is this what I can expect if we choose to stay and eat here?\".  His reply is, \"We are busy and short-staffed.  If you want to leave you can.\"  Seriously?  So we did.  Unbelievable.",

We took a chance and bought a \"mystery date dinner\" on groupon and received a prefixed dinner to Mezzo Bistro. I had my doubts because of location, but the restaurant is fabulous.  We made reservations the day of, had no issue getting in on a Saturday night. The other walk in's were sitted right away as well so despite being busy, still no waiting that I saw.  We were sitting by Sean, the owner, who was pleasant. The decor is something more like a restaurant you'd see in Boca Park or Town Square. Dim lighting, romantic decor and comfortable sitting. Very Italian/wine/grape feel to it. There were all sort of clientele; some in jeans and sweaters, some in dresses and sports jackets. Either way, it's a comfortable and welcoming restaurant.  The service was perfect. Our server was attentive and friendly without being intrusive. The staff was on spot, drinks never got low, plates removed in perfect timing and everyone was very nice.  The food.... Oh please! The appetizers were so good we ate every bite. The entrees were delicious. The one thing that I can say is that everything on the menu is traditional and the entrees that you see at other Italian restaurants. Mezzo Bistro takes traditional dishes and prepares them in the traditional way and does them exceptionally well. We had a caprese salad, chicken Parmesan, the veal special (can't remember the name) and the tiramisu.  Good flavor marinara sauce (which is essential), great tasting meats (we had chicken and veal entrees) and delicious desserts. A number of items are hand made and the detail shows. I asked if we could buy the vinegar glaze by the bottle because it's that good. And the tiramisu I will be dreaming about.  Like I mentioned, we had a groupon so we had a discount, but the listed prices average about $20-25 for entrees.   It's the little details of a privately owned restaurant that makes it exceptional. We both took home part of our entrees from our dinner there last night. It was too good to pass up. When I opened up the bag, there was a nice note signed by the chef with a cork attached to it as a thank you.  Mezzo Bistro will be our go-to date night place for romantic dinners. It will be the place we take guest from out of town that want to get off the strip. Well done Mezzo... Takes a lot to get a 5-star rating, but it's well deserved and really an amazing experience.",

And the black pepper was not completely cracked so it was like getting  large pepper seeds in my mouth and it ruined the dish. The service was bad, I saw good service in the next station, but did not get any myself. When the bill came, it was wrong and we had to have him correct it, which he did grudgingly.",

Its always great and I love doggie bags.  Anytime you start with the cold antipasti, which is every time, you have already overordered.  But its loaded with cold cuts, cheeses, peppers, etc.  Some friends always get the same thing because they love it yet are afraid to try new.   I like to mix it up.    Love the lasagna, the cioppino and its the only place I actually will order an eggplant parm.   I don't love eggplant at all but I love theirs.  Try the riggie pasta, a variation of an upstate NY specialty, with a little bite.  It's also an interesting place for activities like the wine dinners or jazz nights or the musical bingo.  Oh, keep an eye out for the food and wine specials.  And the owner Shawn is a great talk if you get the chance.",

Steak slices were over cooked . The Gorgonzola sauce had a watery taste.  The dressing on the side salad was good. The second order was the bean soup had a nice texture and taste. But, the eggplant parmigiana? In every bite, had seeds that made it gritty and a bitter taste.  Asked the waiter and he told us that they only use one type of eggplant for their dishes that have eggplant in them.  Maybe wasn't soaked enough to get the bitter taste out. Have had this dish many times at different restaurants but 1st time encountered problem with gritty seeds. With most of the reviews, I thought we were going to have a delicious meal. Maybe an off day for the chef?",

My favorite dish recommendations:  Appetizers-- Portebello Mushroom  Meatball Special - their meatballs are delectable  Pizzas-- The Mezzo is amazing The Bianca Parma (my favorite)  Pasta-- Meat Lasagna - I haven't found a better one in Vegas yet. Spaghetti (add meatballs) Gnocchi - this is one of their best dishes.  Also, they have specials that are usually REALLY good. If they hav Chilean Sea Bass, that's usually one of our favorites.   They also have a good wine selection. Josh is one of my favorites that they carry.   I really do love this place. Overall, as many times as we've been, the food has been very consistant.

We were there this past Friday night, and although they were busy, we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.   We had the Salmon appetizer with a balsamic demi glaze and it was incredibly flavorful. Then I had the Blackened Salmon (super delicious) and my husband had the Pork Tenderloin for dinner. My husband's pork was a little over done and the owner Sean came over immediately to make him a new one. He was definitely very concerned to do whatever it took to make sure we had a great experience! That level of service from the owner himself and our terrific server is something that is sorely lacking in so many places out there nowadays.  We enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant with the decor and white lights, the 3 piece band playing was a nice touch on a Friday night, and great food & wine. We will definitely make this a regular spot from now on and recommend it to all our friends!",

    "text": "We have been going to Mezzo's since they opened in 2012.  We have probably eaten there 22-24 times.  I have never written a review, for what reason, I do not know, I should have,  because they are Top-Of-The-Mark .  So this is a long overdue review of one of the best Italian Restaurants in Las Vegas.    Mezzo's food has been consistently EXCELLENT every time we have eaten there.  Their Chicken Riggie is the best I have ever had.  Their Meat Lasagna is superb - you will think Momma Made It. Their Salmon Mediterranean is out of this world!  Last night I had the Peach Caprese salad special and the Chicken Riggie (3rd time), both were exceptional culinary delights!!    If you want to enjoy a superb Italian meal from a family owned business that really hits it out of the park EVERY TIME, give Mezzo's a try.  If you are a wine connoisseur, Sean has some exceptional wines to complement every meal.  And before I end this review, the one dish that Mezzo's serves that you will think came straight out of Little Italy in Boston or New York is their  Frutti Di Mare.  Have not had it in a few months but the last time I ordered it, it truly captured the original intent of seafood and linguini.  Give Mezzo's a chance to steal your heart and stomach.",

    "text": "I wanted to try something differen and this has been on my bookmark for a long while so I came for lunch with my mom and mother in law.  They have a scaled down lunch menu until 4pm (according to their site). I ended up getting their chicken parmesan which was pretty solid! Crisp, not greasy and the sauce on it was homemade and had a nice balance. It was one of the better parms I've had in town. My mom enjoyed her chicken piccata thoroughly and I snuck in a bite and thought it was a solid choice too. My MIL got a sausage and peppers sandwich and really loved it because of their tomato sauce. It comes with a daily side which was a pasta salad she didn't quite like, but you can request for other sides too.   My mom tends to over order so we got too many desserts. Creme brulee is bruleed tableside which was nice since you can customize how charred you like your sugar. Pizza fritta (or we call in zeppolis) was actually pretty good. If you like fried dough like beignets you might be into these too.  My mom took a cannoli home to my stepdad.   Our server was one of the bartenders and he was super friendly and attentive. Great service.   Based on our positive lunch experience, the MIL and I came back with my husband for dinner the following week.   She got the chicken parmesan based on my positive review on it and she enjoyed it as well. The husband and I split the chicken marsala which was pretty yummy with a perfect sauce and a snapper special from the chaulkboard. Unfortunately, that snapper was way overcooked and had a pretty strong fishy taste to it. We rarely send anything back to the kitchen, but this was not something either of us felt comfortable eating. Maybe not the spot I'm gonna order a fish again, but all the other dishes have been cooked perfectly with juicy chicken.   This time service was not as attentive and basic. The plus is that he took the fish back, took it off our bill without any issue, but we weren't checked on. The hubby ate off his moms chicken parm and the marsala and we almost finished the dishes off before we were checked on to even tell him about the fish and request some drink refills.   We ended up getting the pizza fritta dessert again and a tiramisu. I haven't had a good tiramisu in a while and that was light with just enough coffee.   Overall, solid place for some Italian in the northwest. Definitely would order the dishes we had over and over again (minus the fish). Check for groupons as well, I see them pop up fairly often.",

Wife had the Shrimp Fra Diavolo, it was fantastic. I had them make me a Salmon Piccata, and was extremely impressed. We got some kind of croquette as an appetizer, don't remember details, it was a daily special and very good as well. I would recommend this place for anyone he wants to skip the grind of the same ole place. It's nice to find another local place not operated by a corporate chain with cookie cutter food. Stop by and give them a try.",

The service is so slow 45 minutes to get food and it was just spaghetti and other easily pasta dishes the appetizer was stuffed mushrooms and it was more like a bowl of melted cheese. We took our daughter n grand kids here and we where embarrassed by the service and food. They r not cheap either! What happened to you guys? Sorry but I wouldn't recommend your restaurant.",

You can tell it's been there a while, a bit tacky with decor but that didn't deter us. We did not have any alcohol and then felt that the service went downhill from there. Honestly, the food was great. I had a beet salad, it was very good. Three others got  Chicken Parmesan and raved about it. They were friendly, the restaurant was half full and filling up, the bathroom needs work, and the floors are a bit grungy looking. Again, food was good but the place needs some cleaning up. Just my 2 cents worth.",

    "text": "This is a weird part of town for a wine bar, but their selection is pretty great... when it's in stock. They had an amazing-sounding Malbec on special, but they were out of it when I tried to order. And I was the first customer of the day.   They have a great list of lunch specials, from $6-10 apps, soups, salads, and sandwiches, to pastas in the $10-14 range: extremely reasonable pricing. Quality is decent, items we had were hit or miss.  MUSHROOM & BRIE GRILLED CHEESE: Name is a bit of a misnomer, as this sandwich didn't appear to be grilled at all, but how can you go wrong with cheese and mushrooms?! Massive amount of cheese, plentiful portion of 'shrooms, buttery bread.  ITALIAN WEDDING SOUP: This was an unusual take on a classic soup, with tons of fresh, shredded chicken and only two or three tiny meatballs? Lots of fresh veggies (carrots and spinach) in this dish though, and a generous portion for $6. Broth was perfectly seasoned. CHICKEN PICCATA: A delicious version of a classic dish! Thin chicken cutlet is nicely seasoned in a flavorful sauce with al dente angel hair. Simple and well done. PASTA SALAD: This was the featured side of the day, with my sandwich, and I did not care for it at all. Rather than an oil-and-vinegar or Italian-dressing-based mix, this was made with balsamic vinegar? Flavors did not work for me, though I will say the portion included several large pieces of artichoke, which was a nice touch.  Service was professional, interior is nicely appointed and on the upscale side. Though pricing is great for lunch, this seems like more of a date-night spot- and that's what I'd come back to try. Along with a glass of that Malbec.",

The mushroom was sliced and on a bed of fresh spinach, topped with 4 cheeses and a sauce that I wish I had gotten the name of. The cheeses were melted but the dish was not heated so much that the spinach was wilted.  I didn't eat the calamari but my sisters and daughter said it was good.   I ordered the gnocchi for the first time ever and it was delicious!  I couldn't eat a lot because it is a heavy dish but the dumplings were so tender.  I tasted my daughters grilled salmon and it was also delicious.  Great food and great service.  Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "So I have driven by this place a million times thinking \"I gotta get there sometime\".  The consensus that I've heard was that the place was fantastic and had great wine.  We had a Groupon $20 for $45 which is always featured so I recommend that because why wouldn't you if its there and your going to dine there anyway.  Immediately when you walk in your eyes are drawn the candles that are lit everywhere and directly in front of you is the redish orange unique chandallier.  Pretty neat.  Ambiance just punched you in the face. I had been here before this became Mezzos and don't remember the details as much as I did this time.  The ceiling is dropped down creating a circled effect which I thought added a lot of character to the place.  To your right is a little sectioned off party room/section that would be good for a large party.  To the left is the bar area which I really didn't get to check out closely being that we were seated on the other side closer to the kitchen.    The server and guy assisting him were fabulous, attentive and very nice.  I believe the owner was there, however he never greeted us.   I ordered my glass of Chardonnay and they didn't have my first choice.  Soo I ordered my second choice.  It wasn't too shabby but $10 a glass.  I hate the mark up on wine sometimes. The BF was disappointed they didn't have mixed drinks so he just ordered a soda.    The bread came out right away.  Reminded me of some bread that I make at home.  Crusty on the outside and doughy on the inside....warm and delightful.  It accompanied a small bowl of oil and balsalmic.  Too much oil for my taste.  I kinda like more of the balsalmic but it was still really good.  We ordered the Caesars salad to share and it was perrrfect.  For my entree I ordered the penne ala vodka with chicken as an add-on.  It came out and looked amazing.  There was way too much chicken though - SAID NO ONE EVER - except for ME!  Sorry.  I like more noodles and a hint of chicken.  There was a lot of chicken and a lot of sauce.  All was tasty to say the least and 1/2 went home for leftovers.  BF ordered the chicken parm with a side of penne with marinara.  This was ALOT of chicken too but he wasn't complaining.  It almost felt like 3 portions...no kidding.  Needless to say we brought some of that home as well.  Overall a great experience.  Ambiance is a 5.  It has outdoor seating that would be amazing to enjoy if it wasn't over 100 degrees outside right now.  I think with our Groupon we only spent $15 over that.  Nice little date night and a definite need to go back and bring friends!    BTW- the leftovers were BOMBdiggity the day after.  Better than the meal itself.  Big fan.",

    "text": "I originally went to Mezzo Bistro and Wine last year with a friend of mine. We would pass it and decided to go for dinner-we were sold on the ambience alone and decided to go back.   The second time we went the restaurant had gained quite a bit of popularity since our last visit and not to mention we made a conscious decision to go on \"music bingo\" night and was some sort of excited. We knew we would be there for awhile and having dinner so we bought the \"Groupon\" and was looking forward to a good time.   The staff:  Upon our arrival and seating, we informed our waitress about the \"Groupon\" and my friend mentioned that she was on \"YELP\" and she wanted to redeem her free glass of wine for checking in on the site. Her face instantly changed and she stated \"you can't use more than one coupon\". I stated okay no problem, we'd prefer to use our \"Groupon\" anyway since we are eating dinner and had planned on ordering a glass of wine with it. Therefore, forfeit the YELP deal and just charge us for the wine. OMG, I must have asked for the world because her face immediately changed and she stated again we couldn't use both. At the point, I asked to talk to the manager because I thought she was being unreasonable. The owner/manager is so nice, I felt bad for having to go over her head but she wasn't being open. I really didn't think it was a big deal and neither did he because he completely agreed and instead gave us a handwritten card for a free bottle of wine for our next visit and allowed us to use our \"Groupon\". We ended up spending about $150.00 for dinner and wine that night and the \"Groupon\" only covered $50 bucks. To me it's a win, win for the restaurant and with word of mouth it appears it's becoming more and more popular. Clearly, that night the waitress didn't think of those key points. SMH  The food:  Appetizer: The summer salad, with pears balsamic vinaigrette and walnuts. Entree' was the Chilean Sea Bass  with artichoke hearts, atop Risotto in a white wine sauce which was fantastic.  Wasn't a fan of the tiramisu but I didn't complain, I was in Sea Bass heaven by that time. :)  Overall:  I give this place all 5 stars and owner/manager really loves what he does and it shows. I really appreciate his willingness to ensure his customer's are happy and for the most part the food is always delicious. 5 stars!",

    "text": "Mezzo Bistro is situated in a small strip mall with a small cute patio. The inside decor was very pretty, but it was such a beautiful day we opted for the patio. The server was a sweetheart and even though she was covering the inside tables as well, was on top of checking on us and was very friendly.       I ordered the blackened salmon (win) served with garlic mashed taters (win squared) and grilled asparagus (bonus). The crust on the salmon was blackened perfectly and the interior was pink and moist. I had to try not to do a happy dance in my chair...I may have bounced a little.      My bf ordered the chicken parmesan, took a bite and proclaimed it one of the best he has ever had. I make chicken parm at home and was decidedly huffy when I tried it since clearly I would hope my homemade would top this... Nope, theirs is better and my pride dissolved in one bite. The chicken was cooked exactly how you would hope, they were generous with cheese and outstanding sauce (I want the recipe, Mezzo), and the pasta served with it was the perfect compliment.       We left stuffed and happy. Thank you Mezzo Bistro! We will be back!",

    "text": "This was a pleasant new find for me.  Armed with a Groupon, and accompanied by another couple, I knew nothing about this bistro except that it served Italian food.  So, I gave it a full gustatory workout to see what it might bring to the table.  We opened with very good fresh Italian bread and Fried Calamari with peperoncini added.  This appetizer came with a mild Marinara Sauce, and my request for Lemon Aioli as an additional dipping choice was graciously accommodated without charge.  As for the Calamari itself, the rings were very good, somewhat better tasting than the tentacles.  Requested butter was quickly provided for the bread.     Italian Wedding Soup was very odd.  It contained spinach leaves as expected, but also cut carrots and a lot of white chicken meat.  I had to send it back, because it wasn't very hot and contained no meatballs as Italian Wedding Soup should.  The restaurant manager and co-owner who was making the rounds of tables agreed; normally included meatballs were missing from my bowl.  When it returned, the small meatballs were the best part, but I didn't like the included tiny tubular pasta noodles that much.  The rest of the dinner soared.  A dinner-size classic Caesar Salad contained firm green leaves of Romaine Lettuce, crunchy croutons, and a good creamy Caesar Dressing.  The portion was generous and took awhile to finish.  The huge portion of Eggplant Parmesan that immediately followed was cheesy, saucy, and quite delicious--magnificent, and the best of its kind I have ever eaten.  My fellow diners were also pleased with their food.  A brick of Meat Lasagna and Veal Alfredo looked particularly appealing.  There was no room or time for any dessert.  We had to dash off to the Cannery to arrive in time to see the last scheduled performance of \"Red Tails\" on its opening night.  I will sample Mezzo Italian Bistro's several dessert offerings on another day.  Seating was comfortable in the cozy bistro, our servers were friendly, and service was good.  Dinner and the movie that followed constituted a fine night out!  A reprise will soon be in order.",

The calamari was very good, but needed a few more pepperoncinis (IMO).  Sean, the owner, is very friendly and conscientious.  I've seen this guy work himself silly for the sake of his own place.  Heather, our server, was also excellent and did a very good job of making sure we were taken care of during our visit.  Overall, a great off-Strip secret.  One of our favorite places for a great meal and a quiet night out that's not too far from home.",

    "text": "Love this place! We frequent here quite often The food is delicious and has a great wine list. The customer service is great. As with all italian restaurants after you are seated they bring over bread basket, but mezzos bread is fresh and instead of butter they serve a oil and basalmic vinegar with a hint of lemon that is quite delicious  One of the favorites we order is the pizza. Out favorite is the \"mezzo\" thin crusted with a generous amount of mozzarella and sausage...yummmm! Also the marinara ad red sauce they use with there dishes is amazing. You can Taste the freshness of the tomatoes and herbs they use. We always get extra sauce no matter what we order because it is that good! When we asked the owner how they make there sauce he said that the only use high quality herbs and produce and Everything is fresh.  Our favorite wine there is the 2012 Nicky Hahn Pinot noir. It is hands down one of the best Pinot noir I have ever tasted ad we always order a bottle when we come here.  It so has a full bar, but another key selling point beside the great food and wine is the ambiance of the restaurant low dimmed lights makes it very romantic, but you also don't feel that you have to be overly dressed up. It is a quaint place where you can also feel very comfortable in casual clothing.  I recommend giving this place a try it won't disappoint.",

We were seated at a very small table next to the kitchen, we both looked at each other and assumed we had been bad and got thrown into the corner as punishment. I sat with my back to the door and was literally hit with every member of the staff that was walking in and out of the hand off plane from the kitchen to the dining room. I had a perfect view of all the line cooks working and chewing food like they were cows eating the best piece of grass they'd ever tasted. Literally chewing with their mouths wide open, WHILE cooking?!?!? Our server looked at us as though we were a bunch of young punk kids because we didn't order wine, he turned up his nose. Anyway we ordered our food, my bread plate had last nights left overs crusted on it still. While waited for our food, the \"nice\" gentleman who had greeted us began yelling at the waiters and food runners that the \"servers are too slow and that the guests who were seated at the table needed to be rushed or and gone already because he needed to seat a party of six!\" Wait, you are really expecting the server to tell his PAYING guests to kick rocks because another party needs to be sat??? I was blown away. Our food came out, very hot, my boyfriend loved his halibut. I ordered the shrimp fra diavolo. It was tasty but for the same price I'd rather drive 45 minutes out of my way and go to Bootleggers where I am always treated well and never have to see the staff running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Also, I ordered a regular coke four different times and was brought Diet Coke four different times. Are they trying to imply something or just incapable of hearing??? Anyway, save your money! Go to bootleggers, hell even Olive Garden can beat this joint anyday!",

The servers were nice but very slow at bringing out everything. Even the oil we asked for for our bread. My brother's order was supposed to have tiger shrimp which they forgot completely and brought out later on the side like they were doing him some favor. For a dish that was over $24 that's a little ridiculous. He said most of his mussels didn't even have meat in them either. My ravioli vodka never again just gross. The chicken piccata my brother's girlfriend she enjoyed. My grandma had the Veal which was very tender. So two out of the four entrees were good. We ordered Trimisu and chocolate mouse cake for dessert. The Trimisu was very light and not soggy had a nice flavor. The chocolate mouse cake though we never got to try because they brought out a red velvet cake that looked like a flat piece of cake I baked at home with some ice cream on top. Not what we wanted at all. It was dry and definitely not a good ending to our meal. I really wish I didn't have this yelp coupon to use that I already paid for because I would much rather take my business else where. Like Mastrionis where I've never had issues like this.",

I'd give you a ZERO rating, but since that isn't possible, you'll earn a completely undeserved one star.    10/30/2013, about 11:30 a.m.  My wife and I go in for lunch, order a Caesar salad and two entrees.  The salad comes out, and to be honest, it's pretty good.    Then, my wife finds a PUSHPIN in her salad.  Are you f**king kidding me?  A PUSHPIN?    She spits it out (lucky - for you - that she wasn't injured), and I call the only staff member I can find over. (A blonde woman working behind the bar.)  We show this to her, and she quickly apologizes and goes back into the kitchen.  For a while.  My wife, visibly shaken, isn't really comforted by the half-hearted apology and disappearing act.    The woman eventually came back out and went straight behind the bar, obviously having no intention of speaking to us again.  No manager or chef came out to check on us either.  So we left.  BTW:  Y'all can keep the groupon voucher we handed her at the beginning of the meal - it's a pretty safe bet we're never eating there again.  I don't know how the hell you have your kitchen and prep areas set up, but how the hell do you prep food anywhere near pushpins?  You didn't see any possibility that this could eventually cause a problem?  No?    I will say that this wasn't our first time there.  In fact, it was probably our 6th or 7th time in.  And all the other times, I left happy with my meals.  But never again.  I don't care how many good meals you serve, one \"I-could-have-been-seriously-injured-by-your-carelessness and ineptitude\" is all it takes.    I realize there's probably not much you can do to satisfy a customer that was one swallow away from spending the rest of the day in the ER because of your stupidity, but here's a tip:  DON'T RUN AWAY AND HIDE FROM THEM EITHER.    Way to run a business, guys.   So go ahead and try your luck at Mezzo Bistro, people.  It is Vegas, after all, so if you feel like gambling with your life, knock yourself out.",

The pasta was fresh and homemade and you could taste the difference in a positive way. My hubby had the filet with gorgonzola sauce and the meat was cooked to perfection and very tender. Did not even need a steak knife to slice it. Had the tiramisu for dessert. The portion was perfect and very yummy.   In addition, the service was excellent and the owner took the time to go around speaking to each table. Very nice touch.   Ambience was semi-casual, kinda romantic place with the mood lighting. Nice wine selection too.   We will definitely be coming back in the future.",

The food is fresh and fast. Prices are very reasonable. They have specialty nights with wine tasting, music, trivia and theme nights with murder mystery dinner. Wonderful little GEM,",

    "text": "I tried this place twice now....  First visit: I ordered... Spaghetti & Meatballs figuring this would tell the story since this is a basic Italian staple meal.  The meatballs were dynamite I mean I don't normally order or like meatballs but on this occasion they were amazing. The sauce was bland and the pasta... was well just that pasta.  Second visit: I ordered... An order of 2 Large Meatballs again since they were so good the first time. I also ordered the traditional salad. The meatballs were nothing like the first visit.. this time they were bland and not sure what happened to those super tasty meatballs I once had... The salad was small considering the price paid for it. I also got free bread.  So... final thoughts are... I would like to go there and have a sit down dinner to make my final decision....  Updated Review Below..... I also gave it more stars  Ok so I had the sit down dinner.....  FYI - Pretty pricey   Service... needs improvement, more servers needed when it gets busy.  I ordered Chicken Picata and my husband ordered Chicken Parmesan  Chicken Picata ...... way too much flour on chicken so it tasted like paste, but the flavor of the overall dish was amazing. The temperature was also incredible best I have had... came out super hot!  Chicken Parmesan...... one cutlet had sauce on it and the other one didn't but once again... flavor was really good.  So.... after everything considered..... I would go back again cause the flavor was amazing.",

    "text": "Decided to try this place again and it was even worse this time. I have a dinner for 2 Groupon but called to make sure we could use it with a larger party. Someone I was with last time used one but things change so I wanted to be sure. The woman I spoke with ensured me we could use it with a party of 2 or more and that the value of the groupon would just be taken off at the end. Value of the groupon is $94 but the server only took $72 off. The service was horrific. We were the youngest crowd in the place so maybe that had something to do with it. The server had absolutely no personality, took forever to take our drink and food  orders then we had to ask a busser to get our check because our server was too busy talking to the owner (who stopped at every table BUT ours I might add). Might seem silly but I asked for pepper and the server brought over s&p shakers when there was a pepper grinder sitting right next to them. Didn't even ask if I wanted fresh ground pepper, which I did. I later asked for FRESH GROUND pepper and he seemed annoyed. I was so embarrassed I brought my friends here.  I reached out to the owner about my concerns and I've yet to receive a reply.  I'm actually really sad the service is so horrible. This place is super cute, the food is great and it's pretty close to home.  1st review: I loved the ambiance!!! Super quaint and romantic!  Although it seems like no one had an actual role. The guy who sat us was later service someone's table, then tending bar. Great to wear many hats but it lead to confusion on who was helping who or if parties had been greeted/helped. We sat at the table closest to the door so we saw several parties waiting and no designated host and servers walking by saying someone would be w them. And the phone rang non stop w no one answering. First impression started w immediately sitting down to have a long black hair across my plate.. Meatballs came out and although they were super tender and moist there was no flavor! About an hr after our arrival a man was walking around (I'll guess the owner). Twice we saw him talk to employees on the dining floor which was very unprofessional.  The young guy who brought out dessert and extra napkins seemed to have absolutely no restaurant experience. \"Uhh, someone asked for these?\" \"Here's your forks.\"  The place is nice but could deff improve. And something so small as polishing your glasses could be a huge deal. Our wine glasses came super shiny but the other beverage glasses (water&beer) were so cloudy and streaky.",

My son had milk they gave him in a to go coffee cup so it was weird that the server would bring out coffee in a soup cup. They also brought out our kids food about 10-15 mins before our food came so that was a little annoying since our kids were almost done eating by the time our food was brought out. I highly recommend getting the $30 for $50 Groupon but realize that they will not give you happy hour prices while using a Groupon. The server also seemed annoyed when we said we had a Groupon that we wanted to use.",

Just the smell of the food as we walked in made my mouth water. We had the Meat Lasagna and it was just right.  There was a great little trio performing and they were also just right. We were seated so we could hear them and we will be coming back to hear them again. I think they were the Greg Hartman trio. I may have gotten the name wrong as the bass player whom I asked had an accent. In any case, if you like great food at a reasonable price served up with super music you could hardly do better.  We stayed for extra drinks because of the music.",

It's a seamless operation of outstanding customer service and the food is to die for! So far since our 2 visits we've had the Blackened Salmon & Portobello Mushrooms w/Spinach (both appetizers) as well as the Chicken Fettuccine, Spaghetti & Meatballs, Ravioli with Gorgonzola Sauce and Lasagna (entrees). On our 2nd visit there was a live jazz trio - they were amazing! The owner of this establishment is completely committed to providing one of the best restaurant experiences in Las Vegas.",

Nearly an hour later, our table was finally seated (all the while watching tables of 2, 3, 4 that came in after us be seated before us without reservations). The waiter had to be reminded by other staff members to bring us bread, menus, and water. For as busy as they are, they always seem so under staffed. My heart was set on the Mezzo pizza; however, they were out of pizza (ironic, being this is an Italian restaurant)?!?!?!

Not bad. But not great or out of this world either.. it reminds me of this Mexican spaghetti my cunada makes after boiling tomato & onion then adding that into a blender with crema mexicana(Hers might be better since I've craved her spaghetti in the past) My parents both had some seafood pasta(great way to try everything on the menu -..-~sarcasm~) both said it was good, I had a sample..ok, a little fishy but if that's what you like, then it's got a good helping of mussels:) Big bro got some pasta in a butter sauce[apologies for not getting the names of everyone's dishes]; sampled that too. Kind of lacking too.. not sure how to put my finger on it.. I guess I wasn't impressed for the price--almost $140 for 4 entrees, 3 glasses of wine & 2 beers(is that astronomical??? I think so if I wasn't impressed by da food) Oh!& we also had the calamari! Ehm.. dang this review is honestly my worst one to date:/ the food+experience just wasn't there.

Being from upstate NY, I highly recommend the antipasto appetizer. This is a traditional hot antipasto, and is superb. The happy hour is such a great deal, and the weekly specials are amazing.  If you haven't had the opportunity to enjoy this quant restaurant, I suggest you put it on your to do list...you won't be disappointed! Enjoy!",

However, the food was so delicious that I couldn't even be the least upset. I tried the Mezzo salad and a traditional spaghetti and meatballs. The complimentary bread was extremely delicious and fresh. All the waiters were extremely attentive and continued to check on us throughout our visit. The restaurant's atmosphere is good for a date night. It is not overly pricey considering that it is not your typical Olive Garden experience. I could taste the freshness of the ingredients, the cheese, the bread, the pasta, etc. I will definitely be coming back.",

We got there and we were told it would be about 15 minutes to get a table. No problem, until the couple behind us was told it would only be 10 minutes. 25 minutes later , we were finally seated......next to the couple that came in AFTER us!  It took another 10 minutes to get our drink orders taken. When they were brought to the table, the server did not even pour the whole beer into my husband's glass.  It took another 10 minutes to get bread to the table. While a table that was seated behind us got their bread immediately.  Our salads were brought out....warm. The entrees were ok, with the exception of how my husband's steak was cooked.  It's sad that I will no longer be going there or recommending it to anyone.",

This place was no exception. He absolutely loved it- coming from \"the lasagne expert\", it was high praise indeed. I had the filletto Gorgonzola, which was absolutely Divine! The steak almost fell apart it was so tender, and they cooked it correctly (I am a rare to med rare kinda girl). My only complaint was that the wine list was on the pricy side for Las Vegas off strip, however we lucked out and got there at happy hour. Our waitress was also attentive, polite, and cheery. Would highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "Living in the southwest, this place is far out of the way.  With a groupon in hand and a day off to burn, I took off way up there.  The place seemed nice enough, so I walked in and waited 10 minutes to be greeted at the host(ess) stand.  I seriously considered making a reservation over the phone just to see if someone would walk towards the front of the place.  When the waitress arrived out of breath, she seated me near the back next to the kitchen to wait again. 5 minutes later, I ordered a glass of wine.  She runs over and gets it from the bar and dumps it in my glass.  And I do mean dump... like it went up the side of my glass and over spilling on the table.  She didn't notice because she wasn't looking then ran off to the kitchen.  Ten minutes later, she took my order.  Twenty minutes later bread with a side of oil and vinegar came out.  Thirty minutes later, my caprese salad came out.  How on earth it takes 50 minutes to make a caprese salad I will never know. 25 minutes later, my soup came out.  I'm pretty sure this was pre-made and ladled into my bowl with again makes me wonder how on earth it took so long.  After I finished the soup, I honestly wasn't full, but didn't want to wait 20-40 minutes for something that was actually cooked.  I will give them an a star for the food being edible and an additional for having a decent cab franc by the glass.  Minus a star for a careless customer service.  Minus a star for an insane wait times.  Minus a star for a stained white table cloth (eww).  Somehow, I feel like 2 stars in generous.",

This time we went only for what we were hoping to be a quick meal. It was 3:30 in the afternoon and we were the only people in the restaurant. When we walked in there was no one to greet us which is understandable due to it being so slow and the waiter quickly sat us once we were noticed and they did ask for our drink order quick but that's where good service ends. We were sat in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen and our entire meal we could hear people in the kitchen using profanity every other word our entire meal which my 10 year old daughter could clearly hear. There were also another three people standing at the counter so deep in conversation that it took over 15 minutes to get two waters and a glass of wine. The food is good but most of the menu is overpriced which I could justify if the service was adequate.. It's a very cute place and could be great if only they got new wait staff or maybe trained the current staff.",

    "text": "Mezzo is a great little restaurant in a neighborhood sorely in need of more places like it!  I've been to Mezzo a few times now, and the food has been good each time. Between my boyfriend and I, we've had a variety of appetizers, steaks, chicken, and pastas. The house salad is very nice as well (love the FRESH strawberry they include with it!). There's always a good number of attractive specials listed on the chalk board as well.  Also, if you love wine - especially wines that you don't find on everyone else's lists - Mezzo will be a pleasant surprise for you. They have the BEST Malbec, Durugutti, on their list by the glass. They've got several more excellent by the glass choices. And the wine prices are reasonable (I just HATE paying a restaurant 50% more than average for the exact same glass of wine. Take Flemings for example: $15 for the same glass of cab that you get up the street at Grimaldi's for $10. Geeze!).  The atmosphere is nice, the restaurant is clean, and they do have a patio for the days that are nice enough to dine al fresco. Overall, Mezzo is a good experience at a fair price...and I consider myself a food and wine snob. :)  I do have to point out one thing: The service can be spotty. The reviewer who talks about waiting a while to be greeted is right. That happened to us the first time we dined...then a party who arrived after us WITHOUT the reservation we had was seated first! Table service has been generally adequate, though. The service issue isn't bad enough for me to boycott the place, and the only reason I even mention it is in hopes that the owner/general manager will read this review and seriously take it to heart.   Anyway, give Mezzo a try. It's a great little neighborhood place, certainly worth a drive if you don't live in the Northwest/Summerlin region.",

When we arrived, the atmosphere was cozy and we were greeted and sat right away. Joseph, our waiter, listened to what we want and had great customer service. The owner, Sean, came to our table and noticed that it was our first time here. Sean is friendly, personable, self conscious, and people person. The food is amazing and I love that it tastes homemade. I had the BEST Chicken Marcelo and it goes perfectly with the Rosenblom \"Carla's Reserve\" wine, so I recommend both. My dad decided that he didn't want lasagna, so he went for the Salmon. He also had the Italian wedding soup which I had gotten to taste and I would recommend that. During our dinner, we had live music that is calming and it wasn't loud at all, which is perfect. There's also a wine bar and outdoor patio. I only saw 2 flatscreen TV in the space which was good enough, given that this place is suited for an intimate/romantic setting.  The portion size, however, are big for me so I ended up taking it as leftovers. My dad says it was perfect size.  I would recommend this place to anyone and I am definitely coming back again.",

It was actually embarrassing.  We raved about this place and the gentlemen who always provides us fabulous service at lunch only to have it blown up in our face for dinner last night.  We arrived at 6 and left at 8:30.  Watching the manager pour our server a glass of wine while we were waiting on our food was where things started a downward spiral.  She never cleared our plates, I meant never.  We stayed with dirty plates in front of us for over a half hour before I finally asked the manager if we could get our check and maybe clear a plate or two.  We had been done eating for almost thirty minutes and hadn't seen our waitress since the food arrived.  Manager offered no remedy, said sorry, asked if we wanted dessert, which clearly we did not want to sit and wait for that too.  He maid some excuse for his waitress despite the restaurant being not busy at all.  Instead of stepping in and getting us the check he said she would get it.  Another fifteen minutes later and having the check thrown on our table with my card practically falling out of the sleeve we finally got our bill paid.  Thanks for such a memorable experience for my father-in-laws birthday.  I used to recommend this place when all our corporate executives came to the airport, won't happen again.  Don't know where our server guy from lunch was but he shows professionalism, watching your server drink wine the manager poured for her during dinner service is appalling.",

They gave us a cute little dessert when we told them we were celebrating our anniversary. I wish I had pictures but I've since switched phones.   We were almost going to go to an outrageously priced restaurant for our anniversary but last minute decided to go here for 1) the location is closer to our house than the fine dining options on the strip and  2) we didn't need a reservation. I'm glad we chose here for its charming atmosphere, attentive service, and delicious food!   Check this place out, especially if you live on the north west side of town :)",

The food is always good and we enjoy the wine choices. The staff has always been attentive. Prices are reasonable. If you want to try it out, there is a Groupon out there that makes it even more affordable.",

    "text": "The Mezzo Bistro is a restaurant that I have driven by thousands of times but never dined until very recently. It is a truly deep regret of mine, as I tended to judge this proverbial book by its cover and never really thought a top quality, higher end bistro would be located near Craig & Rancho. If you know the area, there is a reason why the intersection lacks a Macaroni Grill, Chilis, or even a Chipotle. It's a rather run down part of town, with a laundromat, KFC, and tattoo parlor nearby. Mezzo Bistro is truly a diamond in the rough, transporting its guests to a home on the Italian countryside, where sauces are homemade, and even some pastas are made fresh onsite.  I purchased a groupon deal for lunch and took my 12 year old daughter there. Despite being midweek in Summer, the place had a surprising number of guests considering that they had just opened a few minutes prior.   Our server \"Camille B\" was very attentive and our glasses never became empty. She was engaging and knowledgeable of the menu. I only wish the proprietor Sean Elefante was there so I could inform him of the pleasant experience that we had.   I would choose Mezzo over any of the corporate chain Italian joints, even Maggiano's. Despite its location, the Mezzo Bistro is truly a fine Italian restaurant with a comfortable atmosphere and a delicious menu.",

Huge portions! Always taking food to go, my two favorite dishes are the meat lasagna.and chicken parmesan! I've been telling everyone I know about this place seriously underestimated. Only draw back to me is I've seen the owner everytime I've gone and he doesn't speak, no eye contact nothing. The place is not super busy.(it so should be food is bomb)  that's the only reason I'm giving 4 stars! idk other than that I will forever be a Mezzo Patron! It's defiantly a must try great for date nites or you just want a really fab meal it's always my first choice!",

The wine selection is great and they usually have a good variety. Most of the time the owner is there which demonstrates a sense of pride in service. My only complaint is they don't have a full bar. If your looking for good Italian and don't want to spend outrageous strip prices, I recommend Mezzo's",

I couldn't figure out if it had been cooked several times, was just bad or bad and cooked several times. It had a texture similar to a silly putty covered leather glove with a similar flavor. Then the bill came and we were charged the dinner prices (at 1pm) We held our tongues, and reflected the price differences in the tip. Needless to say we will never be returning.",

Then after 5 minures went in back came out and talked with them again. We finally turned around and left. The second time we came in at 430 a dark head waiter sat us and obviously was by himself and never came back, once again just was trying to help the patrons at the bar, after our 5 top sat therebwith zero service we left. Finally me and my wife went at 6 pm and ate dinner had a few drinks and had a great time it cost us 81 bucks. So if your going to charge strip prices you better have supurb service when your open or maybe if you put on more labor your sales would increase because like i said dont go there before 6.",

    "text": "Bummer birthday night dinner. Made the mistake of coming here on a Saturday night. There just happened to be some Amy-Winehouse-Wannabe singing that night, and of course we got seated right next to her and her gigantic amplifier. The place was packed and loud as hell.  The Good: I gotta give them props for plating and presentation, definitely gives you the upscale vibe. Their decor is beautiful, a little cluttered, but clearly a lot of time and detail went into decorating the place. The owner/manger was highly involved and was walking around over-seeing everything.  The Bad: We could not get our drinks refilled and our waiter was practically non-existent, he seemed too young and inexperienced. Our drinks were filled ONCE and it wasn't until we were all pretty much about done eating and asked if we could get water at least. It was extremely irritating. I'm a vegetarian and I specifically asked for no bacon on top of my pasta but of course there was bacon all over it. A different waiter brought our food and I brought it to his attention and he kindly took it back, I guess to get me a new plate of pasta. I got my food by the time the rest of my table was almost done eating. The food is outrageously expensive for food that's not knock your socks off good. Our asparagus was undercooked and hard to eat, and I remember the price for it was ridiculous.   The Ugly: Ok. I understand wanting to achieve a romantic, upscale, classy look for your restaurant. And I understand what \"romantically-dimmed lights\" are. This is not it. When it's so dark you can't even see your significant others face who is sitting right in front of you, it kind of takes the \"romance\" out of everything. I couldn't even see the food on my plate, it was actually really fucking annoying. I'm getting mad again just thinking about how dark it was in there. Because of the singer they had performing there, and the fact that we were sitting right next to her amplifier, it was so god damn loud we all had to practically scream at each other. So conversing did not happen.   All in all, not a fun experience and it was supposed to be a birthday dinner. I would maybe try this place early on a weekday when there is enough sunlight to see my own hand in front of me, and when they are not so packed. Food wasn't bad at all, just the environment and staff.",

We are locals (though that probably doesn't matter for purposes of this review).  The ambiance is very chill and romantic, it is the perfect place for a date. When we got here there was live music. Apparently they have live music every other Friday.  My girlfriend and I found the food to be fantastic.   For my appetizer I had the cheese and cracker platter. It was delicious. My girlfriend had fried zuccini which was very good.  For entrees I had the lasagna while my girlfriend had the ravioli. Both were delicious.  Our service was great. We were helped immediately, and our server was very attentive throughout.  My girlfriend and I are both young and know very little about wine. Our server advised us on the best kind of wine was based on our personal preferences. The owner even came to our table and asked us how our food was.  We will definitely come back here!",

    "text": "So we have been here twice. We came in on Friday (October 26th) to use our groupon which was about to expire. After settling in, the waiter told us it was a holiday and we would not be able to use it. I was pretty annoyed, because technically Nevada day is the 31st. But whatever, we stayed and ordered the pre-fixed dinner special which includes app, entree (2 options) and desert as well as a wine with each for $60 total.    The pizza app this evening was delish. It was some kind of pizza with peaches and balsamic reduction on it, which sounds weird but it flowed well with the additional toppings. I got the chicken special (cant recall the name of it) which was served over angelhair pasta and had mushrooms and a wine sauce. It was okay, nothing that made me melt. In fact, I barely remember it or what was in it. My boyfriend got the same thing and agreed that it was just alright. The desert was just okay too.   We went back last night to finally use the groupon. We had an extremely nice waitress and it was very slow. We skipped apps and just ordered entrees. He got the chicken Riggies (sp?) and I got the chicken piccata. Again, just okay/average. Mine lacked any real flavor and was just bland, I tried sprucing it up with crushed red pepper. The chicken was not browned at all and had no golden coloring anywhere, just pure white and not very appealing to the eye. I tried his and thought it was better than mine, but he got it too spicy (you choose the level of spice) he agreed he should have went down a number on the scale. He thought his was just okay as well.   This place is not bad, but not great. Just kind of whatever. We had pretty good service each time so good job there. They need more menu options. I don't eat fish or pork, and there is only 2 chicken entree dishes and one steak option on the entire menu. There is only about 4 or 5 pasta dish options. I think they can add more chicken entrees and make more options available. I had a hard time choosing something, because the options underwhelmed me and nothing sounded that great. We probably wont be back, especially since we don't live in the area, and the food just isn't worth the drive.",

I'm very puzzled by the reviews that didn't have a good experience because ours was nothing but positive from the service to the food!  Maybe you should have asked to speak with the owner so your problems could have been rectified?  Anyway, we live in North Las Vegas and will definitely put Mezzo Italian Bistro on our favorite list.  How nice to have a place to sip a glass wine, eat wonderful pasta, and just relax, all within 5 minutes of home!  We loved the calamari which was so tender, and the fettucini and white clam sauce was terrific!  We ate on the patio and the whole experience was wonderful!",

Then the bill came and we were charged for 1 filet. After we were told it was on them. $55. Mind you we had a by 1 get 1. So if they had kept the other filet on and we gave the coupon they would have not done anything for us! We complained again and then a new bill was brought out. Now $33. And then they charged us for the desert that they begged us to have. WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN. FIRST AND LAST TIME!!!!",

I can proudly say after last time I went there and got penne vodka I will not be back. The sauce was pasty and disgusting. They must have changed their supplier and also our service was very very slow. Took about ten minutes to get water, another 10 to get bread, and another 10 to order. WAY TOO LONG.

This place is the near-perfect combination of value, atmosphere and quality!  It is dimly lit with a large space full of open tables with a few booths along the walls.  The kitchen is centered in the back with an opening in the wall so you can keep an eye on the activity there.  Overall it feels very much like a more intimate, romantic take on Macaroni Grill.  The food selections are also similar, with delicious warm bread served with oil and balsamic for dipping as an appetizer.  The antipasta salad is HUGE with good, quality ingredients.  Braised short ribs and Tuscan tenderloin were delicious, as was the side of pasta that accompanied.  Sangria was flavorful and tasted more of wine than of sugar. Add to this an attentive owner and throw in some very reasonable pricing and it's hard to find fault!  I will definitely be back.",

Our meals consisted of Frutti Di Mare and Riggi's. Both were fabulous, and plentiful. The portions and price were amazing. We ended our evening with dessert of Tiramisu.  Talk about delicious and homemade. The ladyfingers were soaked in espresso. A taste that really shown through the creamy marscapone custard filling. It was a dessert that packed a lot of flavor for the delicateness of plate. We were impressed and will be back. The GM, Sean went out of his way to introduce himself, talk personally to us, and was very appreciative of the business.

The asparagus was fine but I would have preferred the prosciutto to be wrapped around the asparagus instead of a couple slices on top. The pizza was a big disappointment. Wood fired was advertised and you could see the pizza oven but the final product was not up to par. The pizza kind of looked like a take and bake pizza and it was undercooked.

Ok maybe some people love to ingest 2000 calories in an entree but isn't it possible to include a few choices that have light touches other than a red sauce? I had the mushroom over spinach with cheese as an appetizer. It was in a tub of cheesy cream sauce. Way to heavy for my taste. It would have been much better with just a touch of sauce. The veal piccata actually had a lovely sauce with angel hair pasta. Unfortunately the veal was really chewy. Not sure whether it was the quality or the prep.  My husband has a gluten allergy. He had a severe reaction to his dinner. We're not sure what it was from. Perhaps the GF pasta wasn't cooked in separate water. Don't know. I wouldn't recommend it for the gluten intolerant.

    "text": "This place is really a hidden gem in north Las Vegas. As an Italian, naturally this type of food is my favorite and naturally I am quite picky because no matter where I eat, \"my grandmas is better\" lol. I had a very hard time in Vegas finding worthy Italian cuisine until I found this place. In the last 3 years I think I have officially tried every Italian restaurant in Vegas all the way to Henderson and I landed on two gems. Mezzo and Nora. Mezzo tends to be my preference due to proximity and the fact that they do live music from time to time (like tonight). I really enjoy the ambiance in this restaurant, the attention to detail, the quality of the food and the servers. Overall, just good old fashioned quality food. You can tell that a lot of love goes into everything they prepare (even the bread that comes to the table is homemade). I have yet to have a meal here or an appetizer that I wasn't impressed with. Their house pastas are all fantastic, the veal Marsala, the gnocchi, the ravioli and the chicken orecchiette are all incredible. If you are looking to break away from the chain restaurants and enjoy some good home-cooked italiano... look no further!   Oh... and the chocolate mouse cake is to die for, not too rich and perfectly chocolatey and light! I don't normally have enough room for dessert but I always make room for this. Superb!",

    "text": "Well this is a hidden gem. The food is really good and the service is great. We went on a Saturday so make a reservation or expect to wait at least a half hour or longer.   There is live music on Saturday nights, and while she is good, the volume is too high for the space, making it difficult to hold a reasonable conversation.   We started with the meatball appetizer. These. Meatballs are as close as your going to get to grandma's. The linguine and clams tasted great, but the sauce was broken and the pasta was scarce. I had the vegetable lasagna, and that's where I went wrong. Lasagna should not be in vegetable form, but if it is, then I would expect ribbons of zucchini and eggplant with a variety of complimentary vehitables. What I received was a ramican, that appeared to have chopped zucchini, eggplant and mushrooms dominated by riccota and mozzarella cheese. The flavor was definitely that of a Sunday Italian dinner, but it lacked complexity.   All in all its worth a second chance. I'll be back.",

I had salmon with mashed potatoes and my husband had the pork chop plate. This was by far the best we have both had anywhere hands down. We had homeade cheesecake for dessert. The crust and texture of the cheesecake was delicious. The ambiance was great, everyone was attentive, we were promptly seated and wait wasnt long to get our food.

And he has served us on at least one other visit. We also had two children with us and though they did have a high chair that would be it as far as kid friendly.

The server brought and opened the wrong bottle despite me telling him twice, Dark Star, Soft Shoulders. Ordered dinner which didn't come out until after 8:05 pm. My shrimp scampi was luke warm. Sever nor manager/maitre d, whom both walked by our table several times,NEVER once asked why my food was untouched pushed to the open seat at the table. The icing on the cake was at 8:40 when I'm going to pay for th3 meals that were eaten did the server ask if he could get me a new plate. NO THANK YOU.  Also thanks for asking if our party wanted dessert. Your creme brulee is one of the highlights of your restaurant.    Super disappointed because this is my date night spot with my boyfriend when I am visiting from San Diego.   Get your act together Mezzo.",

    "text": "This is seriously one of my favorite date night spots ever!  The ambiance in here is lovely.  Service is great.  We've eaten both at the bar and in the restaurant multiple times, and they have all been great experiences.  Appetizer wise, I enjoy their calamari ($11) and their meat and cheese platter ($16).  Their calamari is served with marinara- I wish it came with some kind of lemon or garlic aioli.  I stick to the same dish every single time I am here... cus well- if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Their filet is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  It comes served with a gorgonzola cream sauce which is to die for!  There is pancetta on top of the filet, and it is served with garlic mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  My husband usually gets their salmon entree and  really enjoys that as well.  The last time we were here was Tuesday at 6 PM.  We hadn't been here in a few months, but as we were leaving (7 PM), they were getting ready to start a Trivia Night, which seemed fun.  The game is just for fun, but I did hear that you could earn desserts for making jokes, lol.  I would like to come back for this next time!    TIP - I've seen quite a few Groupons for this place, so make sure to check that out!  My husband and I usually get the 2/2/2 Groupon if it's available (2 appetizers, 2 glasses of wine, 2 entrees).  It saves us a lot of money.  Dinner for the both of us is usually around $100.",

But according to other staff, that is not the norm for the restaurant, so we will give them a break on that.   The food was good, the other staff were friendly, and the atmosphere was fun.  They even had live music setting up!   If you are in the Northwest, check this place out!",

For sure they have the best meat lasagna I have ever eaten, I'm sure their veggie lasagna is delicious too, I just cant say that I've eaten it. Every time I go here I try to order a different dish but always end up having the lasagna because it never fails.   They are very friendly hand helpful and the atmosphere is always so pleasant.  They always try to accommodate you if they can. For example, I can't eat hot spicy food a d if  they can, they will try to come up with an alternative.   Also, everytime I'm there the owner always comes by to see if I'm enjoying myself.  I love that personal touch.",

I was interested but skeptic.   We ordered the meatball special and cheese plate for appetizers which were great. You should gauge an Italian restaurant based on how well or poor their meatballs are and Mezzo came out on top.   We then had the chicken riggies and the orichiette, both came out searing hot and in large portions. So large I took 1/2-3/4 of it home!   Ambience was great, on a Saturday night they were quite busy and also had live entertainment that was rat pack ish.   We brought a bottle of wine, corking fee is $15. All around, we had excellent service, food quality and ambiance. Would return without a doubt!!!",

Well that's because it sucks. Seriously. The guy can't sing. It's WAY to loud and overbearing... play something with some relevance and turn it down a little.

If I could change anything, I would preferred less carrots, but I'm also not a fan of cooked carrots.  Still loved the soup.   Then I ordered the Scallop Special, which consisted of perfectly seared scallops over a  big portion of cheesy polenta with asparagus on top.  There was a citrus sauce on the bottom that wasn't my favorite, but I didn't care because the rest was so good.   I found out they make their cannolis from scratch, so we took one each to go.  This is a good place and glad we came.",

It was a wine dinner and each wine was explained, I remember having a good experience but didn't remember the food.   We went today for lunch because we were in the area and my friend had a coupon.  Upon arrival the place was empty, approximately 10 people total were in the restaurant.  We stood at the front waiting for someone to seat us there was no sign indicating to seat ourselves or wait.  During this time, we saw the bartender and looked over to him for some type of guidance or acknowledgement, none of which were forthright. After several minutes of standing there and not being greeted we decided to sit at the bar.   When we arrived at the bar, the bartender greeted us and asked us for our drinks, I asked for a diet coke and a water, same order I give every restaurant, every time. I only received the diet coke.  My friend and I ordered the same item the chicken riggies, mine as it came with rigatoni, and hers with gluten free pasta.  After 25 minutes, yes 25 minutes when there were only 10 people in the entire restaurant, our food finally arrived, both with gluten free pasta.  Because I wasn't starving hungry I said I wanted what I had originally ordered and sent it back.  This time it only takes approximately 10 minutes, with just a sprinkle of the cheese on top and nuked as opposed to the heavily cheesed baked option my friend received.  After 1 bite I could tell this was box pasta.  The bartender asked how it was, I said terrible, I said I though the pasta was homemade, he said no only 2 pastas are homemade the gnocchi and orecchiette , crazy me expecting homemade pasta in an Italian restaurant!  I sent it back letting him know it was inedible.  The bartender asked \"should I take this off the bill?\"  I responded it should've been taken off the bill when you came out with the wrong order and made me wait.   No manager, no apologies, no offer for any way to make it up. I didn't read any of the reviews before coming her, if I would have I would have maybe rethought my original decision.",

If I ever came back here, it would be to have a dinner with someone that I disliked, so that they too could experience what it feels like to make a reservation for 6:30 p.m. and not be served food until 8 p.m. My family members and daughter's friends slowly began to leave due to the awful and tortuously slow service. If you ever decide to eat here, please prepare yourself for spending an uncomfortable amount of time feeling parched and hungry. Though the food was excellent, half of my party could not even experience their meal because they had to leave due to the atrocious wait time. Come and eat here if you have nothing to do for 4 hours and enjoy spending your free time looking at empty water glasses and getting to know the dryness of your mouth on a whole new level. Otherwise, don't bother.",

Our waiter was okay, not really dying to please, his customer service was the nare minimum. He really wasn't trying to go an extra mile. I guess it's okay, he looked tired. For the price, I feel like we could have gotten better service and tastier food somewhere else.  won't be visiting again",

Have tried this place many times over the years as we like to give the local restaurants a chance. This was an okay experience, better than most of the times we have been there. Still, something seems missing. This place should be packed on a Friday night, so it is not just me that feels there is something missing. Food seems good but maybe it is the ambience. Hope they figure it out. Strip mall restaurants need to get people in there, somehow. Will go back in the future. Will not give up on them.",

I\"m so glad we did.  The space is cozy and quaint, very laid back.  The food was delicious and the portions would have fed double.  Everything we had; the meatball special appetizer, the portabello mushroom appetizer was amazing.  I mean, it wasn't very pretty, but boy did it make up for it in amazing flavor combinations and texture.  My husband chose the Chicken Alfredo while I had the Chicken Marsala.  Both incredible, tasty, generous portions with plenty of sauce (there were leftovers!). The wine list was well appointed, and my only lamination is we didn't save room for  dessert!  We'll be back and soon.  Thank you Mezzo, we've found our go-to Italian spot.",

    "text": "Me and my girlfriends had heard of Mezzo Bistro and Wine from several people and decided to try it out on a Wednesday, as it's advertised as ladies night - half off drinks and appetizers. The three of us ordered two meals, an appetizer, a bottle of wine, and several glasses of wine - our bill totaled in upwards of $100. The food was delicious as is why I even gave the 2 stars, but when we requested the discounts advertised, we overheard employees discussing our request in the most unprofessional manner. Suddenly, there were conditions to ladies night specials with a certain menu (not advertised) and the waitress (albeit - it wasn't her fault, she was on her second or third day on the job with limited training) didn't pour us the house wines as requested. We were extremely shocked at how distasteful the chatter about our request was behind the bar and in the kitchen - and when we told them that we overheard their unprofessional nature, they were unapologetic. The manager came out explaining that the new waitress didn't know the procedures for ladies night and placed the blame entirely on her - while not even discounting ONE glass of wine! He threw a free bottle card at us (with the purchase of two entrees - which was less than classless on his part) and said that he would like our return business. Well, I had several people ask me on my check-in via FB what I thought and I had to elaborate on this experience although the food was what were expecting and more. Shame, shame Mezzo - I know you detracted several of my FB friends (one of whom planned to try it this weekend with his friends from out of town) with your service being less than acceptable. And the blonde waitress/bar back needs to go with her blatant disregard for patrons and customers in ear's reach. Trashy experience, though isolated.",

I would expect with food and service as good as this place puts out, for it to be REALLY expensive.  Its SUPER REASONABLE! I eat there almost once a week now.  I love going there! Joe, Steve, Sean and Michelle keep you in wine and stitches.  They are so fun to be around and great servers to boot! HIGHLY RECCOMMEND this place",

    "text": "This should be a 4 star review but because of a wine snafu it goes down to 3. Mezzo is an attractive place that serves mostly very good food. They pride themselves as a wine bar and I sense we got a little \"bait and switch\" the other night. we are NOT wine experts by any means. their blackboard lists wine bottles for the evening and the first 2 or 3 least expensive wines were already \"gone\" by our 6:30 start time. I could be wrong..but I sensed the waiter and bartender were in \"cahoots\"  in giving us a sub par wine. what we did get was  OK...but not what we wanted. Wife didn't like her salad much but the rest of the food was fine. I had a pasta fagioli soup which was very tasty. wife had some kind of 3 cheese chicken croquette appetizer. My veal parm with penne was excellent...wife's eggplant parm was quite good. crowd is quite loud..music too loud also....prices very reasonable but that wine deal left me feeling...not quite right.",

Prices are reasonable Good small bar The fruiti de mare is very good, and they will vary spice level. Lasagna is pretty predictable Spaghetti and meatballs were very bready and way too spicy. The lamb special this week was tough and tasteless . They swapped it fast for fruiti de mare but it was not as good as usual. I think I may have been punished by chef for insulting his crappy lamb dish. To finish the night in style I got old cold coffee, but they comped really tasteless tiramisu !",

We were here for a last minute New Years Eve dinner.  We had no reservations & we were dressed like we'd just attended a livestock auction or something on that level.  Anywhoo, they seated us promptly & it was packed.    The chow was fabulous.  I had a steak that was perfect & my companion had Fruitti Di Mar.  Even the wine selection & recommendations were spot on.  Ladies have wine night there on Wed nights.  Hell yes, Ive been & its a freaking fun time.  The only thing that would make that more fun would be a sharp dressed funny & charming guy bartender........wouldn't hurt.  Just sayin,  Love love love Mezzo.",

    "text": "I have been going there since the opening on the restaurant. I've even had it delivered when I was ill and wanted something delicious with the hubby. I truly loved this place; even wrote a good review about it awhile back on Yelp and Facebook.  I take it back.  It's slowly gone downhill on the service and the portions are getting smaller. On the average we would spend $150-$200 each time we went, not monthly but several times a year.    Went there with family a little after they opened on my birthday and we were sat by a waiter, who then asked for our drink order. I asked for a high chair and the waiter threw a temper tantrum and a fit. He exclaimed to another employee that he wasn't even on the clock yet and now he's running around to help us. He yelled at the manager/owner behind the bar about how it's \"Bull-*\" and ridiculous.  We waited several minutes, another waiter came over and brought a high chair and asked if we had been helped. We said yes and we were waiting on our drinks. We waited. Waited. Waited. The first waiter walked by us and didn't have our drinks. Finally we decided to go ahead and leave. We walked out, the friendly waiter offered to serve us and apologized for the other employees actions. It was just embarrassing. He had a temper tantrum because of us asking for a high chair, as if it was inconvenience and then ignored us.   I contacted the owner via email and relayed my frustration. That it was just terrible service of the waiter, if anything let him know that he could be heard loud and clear and something like that should be addressed out of site of my family and my kids. Kelly wrote back, apologized and that they would love to send us a gift certificate for our troubles. I was thankful and told my husband we could try again, maybe just us this time. Gift certificate never came. Just, negative service all together.",

I am not sure if I just went on an off night (since it was a Thursday night before Christmas, seemed like maybe a popular time for Holiday dinners?)  BUT the service was SLOWWWWW!!! Wow I am never one to really complain so I had to exercise extreme control to not embarrass my husband!  We sat down for dinner at about 6:35 p.m. which I had a reservation for party of 6.  It was a cold night and they sat us at a front table by the door so we froze the entire time!  Strike 1 Then we ordered 2 salads and 3 pastas + filet steak. The salads (antipasto for 2 and chopped) took like 35 min?!  BUT they were both very yummy dressings and good portion sizes for the table to share, along with the fresh bread they provided started to turn things around. The entree's finally came like 15 min later.  Shrimp scampi and lasagna were VERY good.  Spaghetti was fine and Gorgonzola Filet was good. Best thing was the homemade cheesecake. I will go back if I am ever in that area, but I will definitely not go starving.",

    "text": "Good food, poor service. We like to use groupon when trying places for the first time, so we purchased the $47 pre-fixe dinner for a value of up to $96 and includes any two appetizers up to $14 each, two glasses of wine up to $12 each, and two entrees totaling $44, with anything additional settled with the bill. Would've been a great deal had we not decided to order a bowl of soup in addition to our meal. Apparently soup is considered an appetizer; on the menu, however, the soup and the appetizers were listed separately. Good to know now, but not happy to find out after receiving bill. Slightly deceptive to consider a $7 bowl of soup (and cheapest item on the menu) as one of the two appetizers without making mention of it until time to pay.   Besides the coupon, the service was extremely slow and the waiter barely stopped by the table other than to drop food off, let alone check on the quality or if we needed anything. We're not high-maintenance diners, but a little more courtesy and interaction would've been appreciated. Also, the tables they seat couples at are tiny (and we're not exactly big), which makes for an uncomfortable dining experience if you have anything besides a couple of plates down (good luck if you decide to have wine and bread).  Total bill including groupon was $75. We drove from Henderson after hearing good things and really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, we should've just saved the gas and found a comparable meal for the same price closer to home. Save your money for another restaurant or skip the shoddy service and order your food to go (meatballs and eggplant parm were great).",

Mushroom app was delicious but is a bit rich. Shrimp cocktail had 3 large shrimp and tasted fresh. Ordered the works salad which is more than enough to split among tje 4 of ys. We ordered the chicken picatta for the kids (yes we took kids on date night as a treat for good grades). There was plenty of chicken and pasta for the two of them. We split the penne ala vodka (substituted for fettuccini) with blackened shrimp. Of the 5 or 6 times we have been there, this was by far the best experience we have had. Our waiter Bryan was quick and responsive. The groupon price fix is welll worth it! 2 glasses of wine, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees for $46. Looking forward to a return visit....maybe without the kids.",

And the we waited...probably a bit longer than we should have, for the amount of people in there. Our waiter didnt come and check on how we were doing very often. im not crazy about always having to flag them down for every thing. But the service was really the only drawback. The food was quite good. We had fried calamari and baked clams for appetizers. Both dishes were tasty, and big enough to share. For entrees my wife had the chicken piccata, which she absolutely loved the flavor. I had a Gnocchi special with bolognese sauce that was also delicious. Side note: the table bread was phenomenal! Turns out the bake it themselves, no surprise it was so good. Overall, we enjoyed Mezzo and will return. Hopefully the service that night wasn't a normal occurrence.",

They constantly checked if we liked the food and filled our drinks. The complimentary bread was soft and warm, served with balsamic vinegar and olive oil with a little piece of lemon in it, which give it an interesting flavor. We ordered the Mezzo Trio Sampler - stuffed mushrooms we/cheese, fried avocado w/lime creme fresh, and fried ravioli w/a balsamic glaze. Everything was great, but the avocado was awesome!!! For entrees, we had the Veal Marsala and the Pasta Primavera w/fresh vegetables and shrimp. My husband declared the veal, the best he's ever had. The vegetables in the primavera were definitely fresh and not overcooked, the shrimp was blackened. Again just a small twist on a classic. Big portions. For dessert, we had the cannoli. Nicely presented with extra white and chocolate chips and strawberries, and it was delicious. Rich but not obnoxious. We will definitely be back. They also serve lunch.",

    "text": "This was my second visit to Mezzo and I must say I was pleasantly surprised as we did not have, let's just say, a very positive first visit.  After my first review which I have now replaced with this one I was surprised when I was contacted by Kelly (one of the owners) who apologized for our less than stellar experience and asked that I give the restaurant another chance. Since I was truly impressed that he cared enough about his business to actually contact an unhappy customer and personally ask us to return, I decided we had to give it a shot and I'm so glad we did.  When we arrived we were greeted and seated right away. Our waitress was very nice, friendly and most of all attentive. Which was the complete opposite of our first visit. We ordered the antipasto salad as an appetizer, which the menu says serves 2 but this salad was like no other antipasto we have ever had before. First of all it was huge, it could easily have served 4 people as an appetizer and it was truly delicious. It had piles of assorted Italian meats on top of perfectly dressed greens with marinated artichokes, fire roasted peppers and big shards of Parmiggiano-Regiano cheese. As an entree I ordered the homemade tagliatelle pasta with Bolognese which was hearty, meaty, well seasoned and truly delicious and my niece ordered the fettuccine with shrimp with what we thought was possibly the best alfredo sauce we have ever tasted. It was perfectly salty, perfectly creamy and perfectly cheesy. For desert we ordered the creme brulee which was rich and creamy. In all it was a very satisfying experience and we are now very likely to return. We are very happy that we took that second chance. Thank you Kelly!",

Was told by the woman on the phone that there were no reservations but if I came in, had a seat at the bar, had a glass of wine, I may have to wait for a few but I'd get a table. I put on a dress and even broke out the heels and dressy purse. When we arrived, the host informed us that no matter if we waited at the bar or not, we would not get a table. I explained that I had called and was told we'd be able to be seated for dinner and he rudely denied that I was told this information. When I explained that we drove across town based on the phone call I had placed at 5pm, I was, essentially told it did not matter; unless I wanted to wait until after 9pm, I was not getting a table and he began addressing the couple behind me; I was dismissed!  By the way, there were two open tables at the time. The man was rude, unaccommodating, and wouldn't honor what his co-worker guaranteed.

    "text": "Went to Mezzo last night for dinner. After the fabulous lunch thought dinner would be as good, if not better. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. Service was slow to appear, when he finally greeted us,without any introduction, the waiter, name unknown, first asked if we wanted water, when we declined he left without asking about any other drink orders. When he returned to take our food order he again tried to leave without asking about drinks, even though 1 in our party ordered coffee. I caught him and ordered the drinks. The meatball app and the mushroom apps were outstanding, lots of flavor, the reason it gets 2 stars. We thought if this is an indication the dinner should be great. The lasagna was flavorless and totally \"unremarkable\" per 1 in my party. If there was ricotta cheese in it it was old and lost all flavor. He said he could only taste the noodles, everything else had no taste. Another had the salmon special, salmon with a white coating over risotto. Salmon just OK, risotto no flavor, no seasoning and undercooked, stuck to your teeth and a little crunchy. The eggplant parm was NOWHERE near the flavor of the lunch serving. Flavor was bland and seemed undercooked, WAY too much cheese, not enough flavor. My steak milinase was steak beaten flat, to remove all taste, and coated with something that did not have much flavor and didn't accent the steak at all, tasted kind of like Sizzler chicken fried steak, with less coating and less flavor. Toward the middle of the meal someone, again name unknown,  not even sure he worked there, asked how our dinner was. We asked about the lasagna prep and were told it was made that way on purpose, without much seasoning as were the rest of what we had. The waiter only returned 1 time to check on us, right after the entree's were served. I thought we had found a place as good as Carraba's, for lunch yes, dinner definitely NOT.",

Not good! When food is really good, placed would be packed everyday! People love good food, so for the place to have two customers at lunch time says a lot about this place.

    "text": "Went to this place after buying their groupon.  Instead of ordering a entree, I decided to switch it up and order just appetizers. I got the calamari, the blackened salmon, \"The Works\" or what was a blue cheese wedge salad, and a margherita pizza. Everything tasted mostly average if not below average, something that you get out of a chain restaurant place like a Chili's or Applebee's. The wedge salad was drowning in dressing and a lot of the lettuce ended up being soggy, on top of there not being a lot of bacon or bluecheese chunks. The pizza's crust was too thick, and with big thick slices of tomatoes on it. The menu described it with only having marinara sauce, cheese, and basil, the ingredients I mostly see associated with a margherita. While I did pick off the tomatoes, the pizza ended up being partly soggy in some places and less appetizing. The blackened salmon was just blackened in looks, and lacking in flavor, but at least it wasn't dried out or overcooked.  They were nice enough to trade out the spaghetti squash with sauteed spinach, but the spinach was cooked with too much oil and was greasy. Even though it was a appetizer, for the price, it was a very small piece of salmon. The calamari was probably the best thing I ate. It was seasoned well,  not overly cooked, and the marinara sauce was flavorful and chunky with tomatoes.  The service during my meal was good, my drink was always filled.  Once I was done, I asked for the bill. Like I said earlier, I had a groupon, and with tax I still owed a couple of bucks and some change. I paid with a 20 dollar bill.  I got the right dollar amount back, but the change portion didn't come with it. Maybe the waitress forgot, maybe it was one of those shady restaurants that \"never has change\" and doesn't round up, or maybe she stole it. I didn't care enough to find out so I just left.  Overall, with the below average food and missing change at the end, I don't think I will be coming back. Without the groupon, the food would have been a rip-off in terms of price, portion, and quality. I'm sure there are better Italian spots in town with better quality food, and who can also give back the right change.",

The meat and cheese plate was a sad presentation with basic cheeses and the prosciutto was hard.  The steak salad had potential but the menu said arugula and it came with some crappy spring mix instead. The veal picatta was bland but it was the best part of our meal. Service started out fine but I didn't get even one refill of my soft drink and it wasn't busy.  They just never offered.  Won't be back.  Plenty of other places to get much better food.",

The service was friendly, We were seated immediately and our waitress greeted us as soon as we sat down, She explained how the groupon worked and also gave us the Specials of the evening. We ordered the calamari, shrimp cocktail, baked ziti with meat sauce, and the raviolis in the vodka cream sauce. Also had the Muscato which was delicious and the cheesecake with strawberry topping for dessert. The food was fresh, and tasty. Large portions, Had to take home some pasta and the dessert. The decor is romantic and this place is great for a nice dinner date. At the end of our meal a nice gentlemen came by our table and asked us how everything was. I thought that was a nice touch from the staff.  I would recommend coming to Mezzo Bistro for the food, service, and ambiance!  Will definitely be coming back here again in the near future.",

Seated right away, they had about half the room full on a Friday night.  Usually busier as I have driven by before and seen it packed.  Here is the only reason it receives 4 and not 5 stars.  Server or the assistant.  We had to ask 2-3 times just to get some glasses of water for us.  They kept the other drinks full but did not bring water until we continually asked.  Other than that, our server was prompt to greet us.  He did take a few minutes to take our order which we were very hungry.  But food came out of the kitchen very promptly.  And now the taste was excellent.  Definitely up with some of the better ones I've tasted around town.  My wife had eggplant parm, which we really enjoyed as it was not breaded and that helped to not retain so much grease from the frying.  I had chicken picata which I really enjoyed.  One of the best in town!!  Overall, this place should get 5 stars if not for a couple of slight miscues on service but it is definitely some place we are going back.",

The steelhead was perfectly cooked and was a very nice portion size that would fill any appetite.  Chopped salad was scrumptious!  Fresh bread and olive oil served while enjoying our wine and waiting for dinner to arrive which was prompt.  Our server Stephen was excellent and attentive and we were pleasantly surprised when the owner (very young but knowledgeable) came by to see how everything was going for us.  A nice touch.  We were lucky to hear Dick Krupa playing his smooth sax as we dined.  (I heard he plays once a month) His playing was entertaining, not loud as we could still have table conversation with the music in the background.  Just a very nice dinner and environment.  A must try for locals. Prices competitive and far less than the strip restaurants.",

    "text": "So the first thing I'd say is that this place IS pricey for the quality of food.   That being said, there is always a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> or groupon posted so make sure you take advantage of one of these as it seems to get them back in line with appropriate pricing.  I will say that I've had some real hits and misses off of their menu.  The real hidden gems are their specials.  I've had some real amazing stuff off of that menu.  Make sure you either ask your waiter/waitress or check the chalkboard at the back of the restaurant.  So, my reason for 3 stars instead of 4 is primarily due to their slow service.  EVERY time I come to this place, my food takes a small eternity.   Not overly full, seems appropriately staffed...why is my food taking this long!?!  Since my restaurant experience is limited to Diner Dash.  I'd say upgrade your stove.  Seriously, I have eaten at several restaurants that make fresh pasta and everything fresh to order and still this wait just feels a bit excessive.  My suggestion would be go when you have a sizeable window after to accommodate.",

Pros:  -Generous portions of chicken parmigiana that are pounded out (as they should be) and includes a nice portion of pasta to go with it.  -Orienchetta (sp?) is very good, this place actually turned me onto the dish and I've had it both times now.  -Decent pricing and with that groupon that floats around, you get a really good deal.  -They are generous with the excellent sauce, not like some places that go cheap, each dish here is smothered in it.  Cons:  -Bread could be fresher, didn't have that fresh out of the oven taste or even a made yesterday taste.  -The pizza is so-so...they are very generous with the cheese which is nice but the dough tastes very similar to a digiorno rising crust frozen pizza dough.  - This last time we went we ordered 2 entrees and a pizza..after finishing our pizza we had to wait an extra 30 minutes for our other 2 entrees...the timing was way off...perhaps the waiter forgot to put in the full order so service was a miss tonight.  Overall, I'll be back again. Stick with the pasta dishes and you should be content.",

    "text": "Mezzo Bistro  The Good, the Bad, and the Office Supplies  It pains me to write this because I really liked this place, but Yelp is all about honest and useful reviews, right? Brace yourself.  In the past two years have I visited Mezzo Bistro about five or six times. The atmosphere is nice, the food is really good, and the wine selection is pretty decent. I have always had a pleasant experience so why would this time be any different? Anticipating my next trip to Vegas, I bought a Groupon for $22 towards lunch because it was one of my favorite off-Strip restaurants.   Was.  Around 11:30am on 10/30/13, my husband and I went in for lunch. We ordered Chicken Parmesan, Chicken Piccata, and Caesar salads. The salads came out and the first couple of bites were delicious, as always. But then, without any warning, I bit down on something hard. Something crunchy and solid. I immediately spit it into my napkin and looked to see what the hell it was.   A pushpin.   I felt the blood drain from my face. Are you freaking kidding me?! A pushpin? In a salad? How does that even happen? Correct me if I'm wrong, but the manager's desk and everything inside it should not be anywhere near the food prep area. I don't even understand how that happened. It fell into the bowl and got mixed in with the lettuce and croutons? What the hell, people?!  So I took a photo of it because there's no way anyone in the world would believe such a ridiculous thing could happen. My husband called the waitress over to show her what had happened. She seemed unimpressed. He then asked to speak to the manager. The waitress went in the back and talked to the manager, but when she came back out she went behind the bar and busied herself and ignored us entirely. Really? That's how you handle such a crisis? That's your customer service policy? To ignore it and hope it goes away? Wow.  Fine. So we left the Groupon on the table and walked out.   I was completely freaked out by that experience. That could have gone so badly, for me and for the restaurant. If I had bitten down on it the wrong way, or swallowed it, that was gonna be a bad day for everybody.   My husband wrote a Yelp review later that day. He included the photo I took of the white pushpin. We all know businesses read their reviews online. To date, not one person, management, legal or otherwise, from Mezzo Bistro has contacted us. Unreal.  This is the only bad thing I have to say about this restaurant. But it's a pretty damn bad thing. Dine at your own risk.",

Your glasses never saw the bottoms and Johnny on the Spot whenever you wanted grated cheese or pepper. Some people I see would write a poor review do to a wait for your food but then say how great it all is-well they just don't know what us put into good food, quality and time. This was our first visit and can't wait to go back to try other dishes.",

Hubby and I come for date nights all the time, every year we do mothers day, but for the past year our dining experience has been nothing but frustrating.  Service was so slow. The food has always taken some time, I used to attribute the time was a thing for quality, but an hour wait time is TOO long on multiple occasions. Food tastes great, but quality has come down, and has been inconsistent. And by golly, can a girl get a refill? Took forever to get water at the start of dinners, took forever to get our bread, forever for our food, and my table had to ask several times for a refill on multiple visits. And, on mothers days, my aunt ordered 2 mimosas, was charged 3, and the wait or said, \"uh no you had 3.\" Buddy you hadn't cleared any plates and she clearly only had 2 empty glasses. He repeated, \"you had 3 but I'll take one off,\" rudely. The yelp rumors are True. Place is going downhill. Maybe, just maybe if yelpers tone changes we may possibly consider coming back. But now, we say farewell.",

    "text": "Food is very good, very cute spot. I am only giving a 2 star rating for two reasons:  My husband ordered the steak frittes which says comes with either garlic fries, house salad or some other type of salad. I forgot. He picked the house salad for his side. They bring his salad in a large bowl and he loves it. Next, our entrees came out. His steak frittes come and it has a small side house salad on the plate so they misunderstood us and charged us a whole house salad when we just wanted it as one of the sides that we thought just came with it.  The second reason is that we had a $10 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> voucher that specifically says no dates excluded. When the bill came, my husband told the server we had the voucher before the server cut him off and said \"We don't accept those today.\" We don't like complaining or drama and our infant has kicked our butts today so we had no energy to show him the terms of the voucher.   So, we spent more money than we intended to. The food is good though, no complaints there. The service is good as well, we just weren't too happy with those two things. One of my biggest pet peeves with businesses is when they act like you offended their religion when you present a coupon, Groupon, or a voucher of some type and come up with some reason to not honor it (not stated in the voucher disclosure). Like, come on, you obviously signed your business up for it. If you don't like losing money with coupons, don't issue them. It's not like I designed it and created it myself. It was only a measly $10, not a free meal for ten. As much as I liked the food, it is all about first impressions and I don't see myself going back. Plus I just didn't like how the server didn't even let my husband finish his sentence before cutting him off with \"we don't accept those today.\" Kthanks....",

The service could use work on some days but the food it outta this world. The chicken parm is tenderized to perfection and a crispy golden brown served with a homemade sauce and some pasta. I love a good chicken parm and this is like cocaine to me. Seriously, try the chicken parm. They also have a wide selection of wine and a knowledgable staff that will help you wine and dine with exactly what you're craving. This place isn't a chain restaurant, just an awesome Italian place. It's like Olive Garden, but waaaaaay better. Here's a tip, if you get the Marsala get mashed potatoes instead of pasta as the side, it goes great with the sauce and is just excessively delicious.

The food is decent and service is never stellar, but it is close and they have a couple of dishes we like.   Tonight, I took my daughter because we wanted their fried pizza dough dessert, sorry I can't remember the name. This dessert is perfect and one of the reasons we come back.   We waited far too long to be sat.  I saw them walk around while we were waiting, they had even come to the front and return menus. They had not apologized for the wait, nor did they say they would be right back.I had to call them on the phone to get someone to take us to our table.",

Although there were plenty of tables, we were tucked in the back corner. The tables were so tight we had to help the waiter serve us. The busboy even joked, that he was glad he was skinny.  We waited quite a while for our food.  My husband had the tenderloin, that he said was dry and I had the shrimp scampi which was cooked to perfection.  We had glasses of wine but didn't order a bottle.  Since we were coupon customers and did not order a bottle of wine we were pretty much ignored the whole evening. This was my third visit to Mezzo. I haven't had a pleasant experience on any of the visits, which is disappointing because  Northwest, LV needs a good Italian restaurant. The food is decent but the customer service could be better.",

    "text": "Whilst walking into this place as a first time customer, I was surprised to find the incredibly loud band right by the entrance (def not a \"bistro.\") I was walking in with my sis meeting others there and without trying to scan the dark interior looking to see if they were there, we just sat at the entrance for a whole 5 min until someone acknowledged that we were there. The guy asked if we would like to be seated and I said there should already be reservations for the other two people we were meeting. I mentioned the last names, first names...in-between names...nothing. \"Sorry, there's nothing here under that name.\" Odd.  I decide this time to scan the restaurant further and find our other party, to which the reservation were under their name. Odd.  So I don't eat meat and neither does my sis, a conscience choice for over 10 years. Not being a picky eater, I can usually tailor the menu's offerings to my preference. I decided to go with the eggplant parm and my sis, the ravioli with vodka sauce. One member of our party gets denied meat sauce. ( hmm, Italian restaurant...80% meat sauce...inattentive waiter denies said meat sauce with no further explanation.)  Spongy bread rolls...butter is served with a canola oil like dip. Not the way it's supposed to be but rather a balsamic evoo accompaniment.  Food is served.  Our poor friend whom was denied meat sauce was also served cold food. Not room temperature. Cold. No apologies at all from same inattentive waiter.  Eggplant parm was not the best I've had by any means. Olive Garden-y type food if I can imagine. Pasta was cooked well. If it's not al dente, it's nuthin.'  My sis has almost finished her ravioli (frozen, not fresh) when she picks up a piece of pancetta with her fork. Our minds immediately go to THAT place.  Oh no.  Tells the waiter. Waiter seems careless. Again, no apology. No empathy whatsoever. (I'm thinking, \"why does this ravioli dish don't list pancetta in its description on the menu? Also, why does this waiter do the job he so carelessly does?\")  Waiter just exits. Sis is grossly stunned. I'm pissed.  As we sit there stunned for a few minutes the owner (I think) comes over like a babbling idiot, blaming my sister for ordering her ravioli dish which clearly didn't state on the menu that any meat was in it. (It took said owner/manager a while to fully acknowledge this and to quickly understand that we know the menu more than he clearly does. He kept mentioning that he was sorry, throwing his hands up in the air with the emotional intelligence of a shoe, giving away his lack of professionalism as well. He then decided to escalate the situation even more by arguing and proclaiming might I add, that vodka sauce is traditionally made with pancetta. I'm from a big Italian fam (Jersey girl here) and I would definitely argue against his claim. Then when the unnecessary confrontation about what's NOT on the menu was thrown back and forth I just about had enough.       That was a hoot.   This owner/manager imbecile wasn't realizing that they made a huge mistake in many areas of this ordeal and could've just owned up to it completely and attempted great guest service skills. Like a child with the hands kept asking, \"what do you want me to do?\" Over and over. As if this was his only means to resolve an issue. I don't know guy, what should I do? You're the owner. Do you have any suggestions? What would be the obvious thing to do since you just shattered someone's non meat-eating ways for over a decade? I was nice.. way too nice..I just requested to take her dish off the bill. That was it. No genuine apologies from staff, just an abhorrent eyeroll. Child exits.   Apart from the inadequate food lies terribly inadequate service. The knowledge of excellence in guest service is sorely needed here and a good schooling on what American Italian food should really be like. I can gladly say I will never be back again for both of these factors.",

Both were excellent, though the actual delivery would have a star knocked off because improper handling caused the shrimp to tip over and half the sauce had leaked out into the plastic bag. Still very tasty and a decent quantity.   My second experience was dining in-house. The restaurant looks far fancier than I expected. The food was excellent! There was nothing on the plate I did not like. They serve bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar at the start. Delicious! I got a Chianti to go with my filetto gorgonzola. Both were perfect. The filet mignon comes with garlic mashed potatoes, a gorgonzola cream sauce, and grilled asparagus. My friend got a baked ziti in vodka sauce. He seemed happy.   For dessert, I wanted the tiramisu but I also had cannoli on my bucket list, so we decided to get both and split them. In the end, I ate the entire cannoli because it was too awesome to share and I suspect he didn't want to share his tiramisu lol The ambiance was terrific as well. The lights are dim. There are cozy spots. There was a singer who sounded great...not too loud, engaged with the audience. She has that slow jazz type of voice that I love. From our table, we couldn't see her, but she added to the experience.   I will definitely be back for more.",

I saw a lot of good reviews so I decided to give it a try, I'm fairly new to this side of town so yelp has been my go to! Sadly I'm not impressed to say the least.   I ordered probably the most basic Italian dish, but the hardest one to get right! Spaghetti and meatballs, and OMG were they bland! Besides being bland, they lacked moisture and were a bit to hard for my taste! I love to taste the cheese in my meatballs, the bread crumbs , and the parsley! Idk what they do or don't add to theirs, but they were so plain! I would not order that again!   As far as the Italian wedding soup, it should be called chicken noodle soup, because that's all it was, we legit got two tiny meat balls!!! I've never known it to have shredded chicken, weird! That wasn't horrible  flavor wise, but the broth was kind of thick, the meatballs must of been boiled then sauteed cause they had a crust! Once again meatballs should be tender, and a boil for them in a soup like that is all that's needed! Lastly the noddles were big, we all know how small of a pasta this soup is traditionally served with!   My boyfriend liked the lasagna though, but he doesn't know authentic Italian like me! Jersey east coast girl all the way, you have got to do better! Sorry but I do not plan on returning, with how the food tasted tonight!",

Waiter was rude didn't fill up drink ,no customer service, my husband had to flag him down multiple times 3. At the end to pay we had a groupon and it was a $30 voucher but when we show him  he says you have to pay taxes without voucher!! That's crazy so i asked him where on Groupon says that and he gets upset ,get smart and says it's on there , so i show him my phone with the part that says \" fine print \" and nothing on there say it so he says it's not on there and that's their rule. Ohh the food was not the best due to waiting so long to eat, will not be returning complete rip off and he refuse to give me his name.",

The server was a younger guy and he had only two tables in the entire restaurant and he still wouldn't pick up our dirty dishes, refill our drinks, or ask if we needed anything.   This recent time however we were sat near the bar and we had Ali, she not only tended to the bar but she also tended to the tables! She was always attentive to the tables and the bar. Polished glasses and cared to our needs all in a positive attitude. Ali definitely turned the bad service we had before around. I hope so bc I really liked this place and I believe it has a lot to offer. Good to have people like her here.  TIP: Happy Hour here is from 4-6pm weekdays and it's $3 house wine (for red Cab, Pinot Noir, Merlot). The beet salad was good and mushroom was good too, that there will fill you up. Hope to keep this place going!",

I remembered seeing a Groupon so we got the spend $50 on food for I think $25.  It wasn't too busy when we came. Got seated right away. They bring out bread and olive oil as we wait for our food. Also with check in you get a free house wine but I opted out of it and saved it for a rainy day. I ordered the veal with the lemon butter sauce that had capers in it. I forgot the actual name of the dish. To be honest, I really didn't like it. The sauce was good but it wasn't amazing. The veal was cooked right but didn't stand out. The capers didn't go with the dish and I usually love capers. The beau got chicken parm. The portions are definitely like family style or at least sharable. It was huge for the price.  We did get tiramisu for dessert. The beau liked it but I wasn't much of a fan either. It didn't taste as good as I would have hoped. It kind of tasted like it was bought at A grocery store.   The service was great. Our server was very attentive and checked in regularly. No complaints there.",

    "text": "I'm so sad bc I have had this place on my to go to list for months. I had a groupon($50) and we finally went tonight for dinner. It was crowded so we're glad we made reservations but we still had to wait an additional 15+ minutes after our reservation time. To me a packed place should mean good food...we got some warm bread and olive oil balsamic for dipping just enough to not let us starve. The host was running around seating guests answering the to go orders and re setting  tables- it just should have been delegated to two people bc it was too much for one person. I had the Caesar salad decent portion-$8 and good taste. My guest ordered the meatballs app($7)so I took a bite-very mushy & had no real flavor or spices. He said it tasted microwaved. They didn't taste oven made. I got the chicken Parmesan-decent large portion but it came w penne pasta plain w/red sauce-the pasta was literally cold. Is that a thing or what happened? I didn't eat it. He ordered pepperoni pizza and he Room a few bites and stopped eating so I asked for ampere and flipped the pizza slice over-it was raw dough! I showed the server and I was shocked that it was t fully cooked I've never encountered thats ever. We were too afraid  to eat uncooked dough. He ordered the Caesars salad and added ($5) chicken. Pale white chicken tasted microwaved not grilled and just had tons of peppercorns all over it. I'm just confused why this place was so crowded. I'm not a trained chef and I can cook pizza and pasta and they'll be hot and cooked all the way through. Maybe it was a bad night but the lady next to us said her angel hair was overcooked so I am not sure what was doing on. I gave it points for a decent Caesar salad, the overall atmosphere and decor was nice and the female singer was great. It was pretty sad of a drive for us not sure we would go back...just disappointed bc I was hoping we found a new to go to Italian place since we are new to Vegas.",

From my receipt it said his name was Steve, he's a taller guy so when he was taking our order he stood so close his crotch was in my face basically, so I couldn't look at him when ordering. Not a big deal but it was his attitude that was the issue, we were celebrating our parents 31st anniversary, so it really sucked to have that mess up the night. One of my family members had a groupon at the table and tried to order something off the menu that I guess you can't order while having a groupon. Instead of explaining it he just said you can't order that, so we said we'll use someone else's dinner for the groupon since it's the same ticket, and we went through that a few times till he finally said you can't have it at the table with the groupon. Then when it comes to ordering desert my sister wanted to order a cheesecake, he stated rudely we don't have cheesecake, and glared at my sister. He made everyone at the table feel like it was our fault they didn't have cheesecake. With no suggestions or any real customer service at all. Finally when it came to the bill my sister and her husband said they are taking care of my parent tab and theirs and I would be one my own. So he said okay 2, 2, and 1 and we explained again no the 4, and 1 on their own. With a yeah that's what I said, again rudely and walks away. If someone said 2, 2, and 1 while pointing at you wouldn't that make you think he thinks it's 3 tabs in all and not 2 with 4 ppl on one tab and the 1 by myself. Overall it's made my parents anniversary dinner a let down and disappointment.",

Went for dinner on a Saturday night, was told there was a 15-20 minute wait when we arrived, even though there were 4-5 tables open at the time. We sat at the bar and waited and kept asking each other why was there a wait when 4-5 tables were open?  When it came time to seat us, the hostess took us to one of the tables near then bar that had been open the entire time. Found it very irritating that they made us sit at the bar and wait for 20 minutes only to be seated at a table that had been open the entire time. Our waiter was friendly enough, but had to ask what the specials were, he didnt even mention them even though they were all listed on a huge chalk board on the wall. He raved about the 8oz. filet special, so we both ordered it , and asked for medium well. When the entree's arrived mine was more medium rare, but was ok, wasnt going to send it back for that, but my girlfriends was blood red raw. We told the waiter that it was not medium well, but raw. He agreed that it was not done, and took it back to the kitchen. He came back a few minutes later and said \"if you think it looked raw out here, you should have seen it under the light in the kitchen, it was really raw\".  All they did was take it off of our bill, didnt offer to bring out another one, or even offer her anything else to eat, so we left with her having no dinner. Since they took her entree of the bill, I didnt need to use the Groupon.  The experiance was so bad I doubt we will go back to even use it. Just going to write it off as a bad dining experiance and move on. I'm still wondering how they could serve a filet without noticing that it was raw, and it was one the highly rated specials that night.",

When we arrived for dinner, we were seated immediately.  It took a little time before our server greeted us.  We were a little frustrated when another couple was seated after us, and the server went to greet them first.  It seemed like they were regulars, but I still would have appreciated him greeting us sooner.  After he greeted us, the service was fine.  The food was delicious.  We got the shrimp cocktail (biggest shrimp I've ever seen) and the antipasto salad (which was enough to provide lunch the next day) as appetizers.  My husband got fettuccine alfredo with chicken and I got the grilled salmon.  Both were great!  The deal also came with 2 glasses of wine, we got Pinot Grigio, which we really enjoyed.  The Groupon was a great deal!    We were there awhile, but I don't mind a longer dinner in a place like that.  They had live music, which added to the cute atmosphere.  We really appreciated one of the owners stopping by to ask how things were going.  When we told him it was our first time there, he asked a few more questions about our experience.  We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "I've had dinner here several times. After my lunch experience today I am not sure I will ever return. For starters I was  charged a dollar for a TO GO order. I highly dislike being charged  for the few steps I took on my own accord to pick up my food. I understand charging for a delivery fee. However, I walked from literally next door. And, when I placed the order not once did they mention there'd be a charge. I ordered with at least fifteen minutes notice of when I needed the food and was told my order would be ready for pick up within ten minutes. Upon my arrival not only was there no greeter at the door, my food had not yet been prepared. As I am on a limited amount of time for lunch this was an inconvenience. I ordered the Brie grilled cheese sandwich. It should be renamed to a grilled bread with mushrooms, onions and perhaps some cheese sandwich. I paid good money for a sandwich that did not have much of the main ingredient-cheese. I was highly disappointed and WILL NOT be ordering lunch there again.",

Their antipasto salad is a great way to start out the meal. It serves 2-4 people and will get your taste buds going for the main course. As for entrees, it may be simple, but the eggplant parmesan is wonderful. Also, pay attention to the specials. There are often creative and great daily dishes. For dessert, the tiramisu is divine. The wine list is solid and they will often have wine specials. The decor is decent, but a little too cookie-cutter Italian for my tastes. The service is usually satisfactory, but there have been some letdowns. If you plan to go, check out Groupon, as they often run deals through there.",

Food finally came out and a huge portion of Veal Parmesan arrived along with a perfectly cooked med-rare filet. This is a good place to eat the only thing I would not recommend is their Sangria, it tastes like grape juice. We had a taste of both red and white and they were just too sweet.",

This was a few days ago, and I am still thinking about it. I got the chicken riggies and hubby got the lasagna. It was quite literally the best Italian food I have had in years. The prices aren't bad either. The only gripe I may have is that there are a few bad tables in the place, just try not to get seated in them. One is a round table right by the bathrooms, and the other is a 2 top right outside the swinging door that the servers exit the kitchen from. You get a small draft every time it opens.",

The food was great. We knew we had to spend $33 per person (three of us) because of the coupon restrictions of $100 total. My wife and son had a couple of glasses of white wine, a salad (or soup) and an entree. I had water, the salad, soup, entree and a desert. Our bill was $103. The food was great! We were able to have exactly what we wanted and stay within our budget. Service was top shelf for sure! Stephanee, our server, was very polite and right on top of everything that we needed. My water glass was never empty and the wine service was always on time. Food came out (very) hot and warm bread on the table was made plentiful. With a $20 tip, total pay out for 3 ppl and a great meal was $73. Pretty good.  If I HAD to make a critique, there was wax dripped down the back of the seat. No big deal, but attention to those details in a gourmet room is well received. Will we be back? Yup!",

When we left Mezzo, the establishment was about 75% full and is usually a good indication of both quality of food and good service. We sampled both the beet salad and calamari appetizers.  Both were very good and I would recommend and order them again. The house Cabarnet was fairly good and only $3/per glass.  Good value and was a decent quality.  Our bill was $48 for two, not including the tip. We attemped to use the Groupon/AmazonLocal coupon that we purchaed for $12 and the staff at the resturant told us that they would not honor it because we ordered from the Happy Hour menu.  The Happy Hour menu did not mention this fact and the coupon/voucher that we purchaed did not mention this on their disclosues and termf of use.  Beyond this, I would say that our experience was plessant and favorable in every other way. We will probably revisit this establishment in the future.",

It's close to home and locally owned.  I can say the staff has gotten nicer and the food has gotten worse.  My husband likes pepper on his salad the our waiter told us the chef refuses to have salt and pepper for the table.  Sometimes the wait staff will offer fresh ground pepper and others act annoyed (they use to ALL act annoyed).  Their wine list is pretty good but in my opinion restaurants also need good service and food.  Food is mediocre.  Their soup and salads are the best thing on the menu.  I've also ordered chicken, fish, pasta and pizza and it's just okay.  We brought guests for the chefs special \"surprise me\" (sorry forgot the name) and it was okay.  We had 1 vegetarian in the group and we all wished we all had requested the vegetarian option.  Funny thing is they don't really offer much meatless options on the menu but this night the chef must of came out of his box to surprised us.  Like other reviewers state....there are better Italian places in town but just not as  conveniently located.  I do hope their menu and food improves and when we are in the mood for some close to home, mediocre food we will stop in.",

We ordered house salad (great), better salad (huge portion, light and delicious), grilled veggie appetizer (great seasoning), portobello pizza (added ricotta was delicious soft dough) and a vegan pizza (pizza with veggies and no cheese). All was yummy we enjoyed the food.  The service was not as fabulous. I don't like to dock stars on service when I think they are trying hence four stars but really the service was like a 2 Star. VERY slow, it seemed like there weren't enough waiters and they were a little unorganized. If you are not in a rush it's totally fine! Have some wine and relax. We had an infant so didn't want to spend two hours eating there.   Would definitely come back without a little one on parents night out. Food yum!",

    "text": "What a cute hidden gem on this side of town tucked away in a strip mall. This is going to be our new date night spot. The bf was so impressed he said we could possibly have our reception here.  The ambiance has been well thought out. It's very dark, romantic, and cozy here.  The service was spot on but we were the only diners at the time.  I say check out the lunch menu for good prices because regular menu items were a little pricey.  The food was flavorful and came out in a timely manner and was piping hot!  There was enough to take home for later.  We didn't try any wine, but we will save that for our next dinner date.  I loved the amount of seating in the place. There was the bar, the for mentioned private dining room, and at least 20 tables/booths to chose from.  I really would like to see this place stay in business because its a great addition to this part of town which is otherwise known for it's numerous fast food locations.",

We were a party of 3 and each ordered a regular pasta dish with chicken added and 2 soft drinks and water, our bill was $77! The food was ok but not like wow that's good stuff. It's overpriced considering all you get is white bread with your meal. I'm still in shock about the cost, service was decent. Our waiter apparently serviced the entire restaurant by himself.   This was a first and last time I will dine here, there's other establishments much better with better prices",

Its a shopping center on rancho as I am sure you see lol..but I NEVER noticed it.. Probably because the Love Store is all I see anytime I pass by there.. Yep folks its in same little area as that.. Now let me start by saying It was lunch time on a Friday so they weren't slammed but the setting is really nice and relaxing as you walk in and their menu options and lunch specials are really good. The quality of service we received from Camille sp* is what took it above and beyond though. Not only was she super efficient but she was friendly , listened, gave suggestions and even split up a salad appetizer we were sharing.. Which was an amazing Beet salad.. I cant wait to go back and try out their other items... I will also hopefully get helped by my fellow potter head Camille",

Didn't tell us about specials or anything, maybe because we came in with a bogo? Who knows, just wish there was more service.  Where they shined was the food! My chicken Alfredo was phenomenal. I was honestly expecting very little dry chicken in it but it felt like a decent 6-8 ounces of chicken added. The sauce was very creamy and there were chunks of cheese that I loved.   With the complimentary bread he did offer to bring us out more but failed to bring more oil and vinegar which was a bit disappointing considering we had ran out.  We also got the ravioli and the cheese inside was incredible! Well cooked and the sauce was great!  Overall it was good, may be back",

So I opted for hot tea, they didn't have earl grey but had other selections.   I ordered the meat and cheese board, and fettuccine with chicken, tiramisu, and a cannoli, plus bread with balsamic vinegar. Everything was very well prepared and the taste was wonderful. My fav was the cannoli.   There is plenty of interior table and booth seating, plus there is a separate room for larger parties. They even have an outdoor seating area with lights.   I would def recommend, prices are a reflection of quality and presentation   Location is Rancho/ Craig - ample parking",

    "text": "First check in of the year! Woo! Mezzo is a little ways from home if you live by the strip but it was well worth the drive! About 23 minutes from our house so not bad.   When we arrived I noticed the outside area has a nice space for those hotter days. I liked how they have lights all around the space for when it gets darker out. We walk inside and the atmosphere is just perfect! There were only a few people inside enjoying their meals so there was plenty of space to choose from for seating. We ended up sitting at one of the tables by the bar in full view of the tv so we could watch football.   The lighting in mezzo reminds me a little how bonefish grill has their space setup. Very dim and cozy but still swanky. You have to look hard to see people haha! Our server came and we ordered the baked ziti and the chicken wrap with fries and pesto mayo(it was still lunch time but almost over about 15 min til happy hour). The bread basket came out with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping. We both loved the bread because it was very soft and they seemed to have baked garlic or something inside of it that added more flavor. The baked ziti was just how we like it: hot and cheesy, oozing ricotta and lots of sauce! Very good. The chicken wrap with fries was also delicious! I think there were roasted red peppers inside also which were good. The fries were nicely cut steak fries with garlic stuff sprinkled all over. Those got taken home along with the leftover bread and ziti.   The service was ok. We had to wait for our server maybe once or twice but wasn't anything to ruin our experience. We could see and hear a group of them at the bar chit chatting for most of our visit with certain servers breaking off to tend to their tables. Our server was great at helping us with getting our free house wines with check-in...yea free wine which was amazing. Room temp Cabernet that was sweet and smooth! The wine here is definitely a must. FYI if you want to do a groupon deal here you must purchase it 24 hrs prior.   We loved this spot and will definitely be back for happy hour and date night festivities. If you want to try a sample of things I suggest taking advantage of the happy hour here which runs everyday if I'm not mistaken! House wine for $4 is a steal!",

Update** I rated 4 stars since I have a very sensitive stomach and it could of been me. But honestly I never have any problems with pasta, also the person that was with me that night did not love the food but didn't have any problems after. So, I might give it a last chance and see how it goes.",

I probably wouldn't have noticed if I had been with someone.  I'm not big fan of the bread they serve for it being an Italian restaurant but other than that it was a good visit.  The important part is that the food is good.  I had the Riggies which I had not had in some time and it was as good as ever.   The portion was huge and I had enough for another meal.  My server Ali was very attentive and provided great service.",

Our Waiter Steve S. was a gentleman and the Best at his job. Food was so delicious from Appetizers to the Main Courses! The house wine was delicious. Prices are so reasonable and fair. Love the place. We will return for sure and I hope you give this place a try too! You won't regret! Guaranteed!",

We sat at the bar and had two apps, two entrees, and two glasses of Tobin James Zinfandel. The bartender/server was very polite and attentive. My husband had pasta fagioli soup and spicy chicken riggies which he always loves. I had a golden beet salad (yum!) and eggplant Parmesan with veggies instead of pasta.   Mezzo probably has my favorite eggplant Parmesan in town. It has no breading whatsoever, just layers of eggplant, sauce, and cheese baked in a ceramic dish.   I would definitely come back to Mezzo more often if it was closer to home. But if I'm ever in the northwest, I'll definitely have to make a stop in.",

The Groupon wasn't a selling factor of this place. As I was encouraged by the hostess to purchase it. They told me, I wasn't even aware prior. I would've happily purchased menu items full price, but upon arrival, the rudeness was enough to make anyone lose their appetite.   Go to Grape Street or Grape Vine!!!

Service was mediocre and the food was not chef-worthy at all.  Hubby's chicken parmesan cutlets were overcooked--dark brown and hard, nothing golden about it. He's not the type to complain, so he worked at it and ate it. My veal piccata had globulets of congealed flour in the lemon-caper sauce, did not look very appealing, and the veal wasn't tender at all. Our server attempted to do her best, but she was inexperienced, so we kept our opinions to ourselves and just enjoyed what we could of the night.  One more thing...why would anyone serve a cup of espresso that is stone cold? We did comment on this! The other guy brought it, so our young server had to check and came back saying the espresso machine wasn't working. Again, really disappointing experience. There are way too many other very good Italian restaurants nearby, we won't waste our time or money here again.",

Eggplant parm had 2 thinly sliced pieces of eggplant and an over abundance of cheese.  Unfortunately,  they make you wait so long for the food you're hungry enough to eat whatever is put in front of you.  The pizza was good.  The bus boy was awesome.

    "text": "I can't believe it's been almost six years since I wrote my review of Mezzo, so it time for an update. We've been back many times since then, but this time we went a little earlier than usual; we often are the last ones standing (or rather, sitting) when we eat out. I'm so glad we did, because we were in time for the music.  The owner, Sean, recognized us and gave me a hug, even though we haven't been there in a while. Let's face it, our town is blessed to have so many great restaurants that you'd have to eat out 3x/day x 365 days/year, and probably still not come close to hitting them all. And Mezzo is quite a drive, so it's a testament to the food, service and ambiance that we go as often as we do.  The musicians were playing when we entered - a wonderful jazz group called TriTones. They so obviously enjoyed what they were doing, and the trumpeter was having a lot of fun throwing in little riffs of Xmas and Chanukah music. I wish my camera were as good as the guy sitting next to me, who was able to get well-lit video on his iPhone. I guess it's time for an upgrade, because my videos were too dark to see anything.  But we came for the food, since the music was a pleasant surprise, and I'm happy to report that it's as good as ever. I hadn't had the Tuscan Tenderloin since my first visit, which I'd had a problem with, but decided to try it again. Sean assured me that I'd be happy with it, and I was. The large piece was accompanied by asparagus, some apple slices, and a light sauce, as well as a substantial serving of rigatoni.  We shared a house salad which, unlike our very first visit, was split by the kitchen. It was larger than expected, and well worth the $5 charge.   Unlike me, my husband polished off his glistening chicken marsala. I was full from the salad, asparagus, bread and bubbly, and took home enough meat and pasta to add a few things and make a second dinner for both of us.  Lovely ambiance, great food, good service and superb music - what's not to love?",

Although, my server didn't really explain much or tell us the special. We overheard it from the next table and when I asked he said it's on the board, which was really dark to read, considering it was on a chalkboard ( remember I said the lights gave a nice ambience so it wasn't the brightest). That didn't take away from the fact that the food was delicious!  We had used a Groupon ... and mentioned it of course to our server first , just in case of any mishaps.  We ordered the calamari it was fresh and crisp and I liked the garnishing of Pepperoncinis. Warm bread & olive oil was served on the table as well. I ordered the chicken piccata it was delish, perfect blend of lemon and butter white wine as I expected the flavors to be. My hubby ordered the chicken Marsala it was also very Rich and tasted as expected ... delicious! The portions were pretty big for us... 2 pieces of check cutlets each. Both plates were served with angel hair pasta. We took home the rest. We were only able to eat one each LOL. Really liked this restaurant. Worth checking out.",

That certainly was not our experience here.  After reading other reviews on this restaurant, I was surprised at our experience, which was not stellar.   I had their Oriechette Calabrese, and the Pasta (little ears) appeared to have been grabbed by the handful, and squeezed, came in very large clumps which I had to CUT with a knife into smaller pieces to eat.  When it was suggested to the Host/Owner?/Waiter that there was a problem with the Pasta, he was somewhat arrogant and dismissive, and offered not even an apology.   My Wife had the Meat Lasagna, and she was disappointed that there was almost no pasta in it, just lots of sauce, and cheese.   We will likely not frequent this place again, especially with the chatter noise level that we experienced.    Not a quality Restaurant today in my opinion.  Seems like something's changed from when this place was getting rave reviews.  I just noticed that they're taking Groupon here, a pretty good indication that quanity (of customers), not necessarily quality and service is their priority. We",

Anyone that lives in the area knows that there are very few choices for a good meal in the area. As soon as we walked I was impressed by the decor. I noticed a room off to the side that would be perfect to host a birthday party or baby shower or something of the sort.     We love wine so we opted to sit at the bar. I must say that this was the best decision we made all night. The bartender was very knowledgeable of the wines they carried and was very helpful helping us pair the wine with our meal. They had a great selection that was priced very reasonably.    For my entree I ordered the chicken parmigian.  My husband ordered the veal piccata. My chicken parm. was very good. But the veal piccata was Amazing! I am usually not a fan of veal so I was reluctant when my husband kept trying to get me to taste it. But i was so glad I did. Not only did I like it I am planning on ordering it next time we go.    I was so full after dinner that I wasn't planning on ordering desert but i have such a sweet tooth that we decided to split a dessert. We ordered the chocolate cake and it was to die for!!!  Needless to say we both left the restaurant full and happy.    I am so grateful that we no longer have to drive to the other side of town to get great italian food!",

Overall everything that we have ordered has been delicious.    The building was clean.  The lighting is soft and low.  And the staff was knowledgeable and polite.    What truly makes the place great though is the sense that they care.  The owner personally comes to every table and solicits feedback about the meal.  No one in our party doubts that they work hard to make sure they provide the best experience possible.  It is great to see a local business that goes the extra mile to succeed in a down economy.

I love to get the lasagna here and he usually picks a pasta with some kind of sauce and clams.  The portions are always huge and it isn't very expensive to eat here.  Since I've been coming here there has also never been a line or wait for a table.  I guess it is kind of out of the way of other places and maybe not in the best location so it isn't as popular as say BJ's.  But let me make it clear I would rather eat here then BJ's anyday- it is real food and by that I mean not so processed, not microwaved, authentic Italian.

Seriously we both work in the food industry (hes a GM) and it just blew my mind how things were handled in your restaurant... 1st we sat at the bar and didn't get acknowledged so when our table was available we sat for a good 10 min before we were asked what we were drinking.... I'm assuming he was the busier he explained he could only get non-alcoholic drinks.....  We were given little 4oz glasses not even filled up? Is that a joke? The couple next to us had real water glasses!!! Then the server came about 10 min later we ordered our wine and beer... He came back with my beer and told my boyfriend they were looking for his wine.... 20 min later it was \"unavailable\" Took over an hour to get out food as your server mike came to the table and says \"sir 10 more SECONDS!!!!!!!!!!!! really it was 30 min later we arrived at 6:45 and hadn't got our dinner till 8:20!!!! You do the math!... really spaghetti!!! Oh and Mike's excuse was that the customers who did your 5course meal were to be served be for people who ordered off the menu WHAT KIND OF ANSWER IS THAT?????YOUR MANAGER, who knew there was a problem ignored us didn't even acknowledge us!!!! Didn't even offer to buy us a drink!!!!!! The couple next to us was just as UN happy with your servers lies and excuses! They WERE your customer's for 2yrs and they wont be back... We were referred by a good friend and I promise you we will NEVER REFER YOU TO ANYONE! FYI Chix piccata with penne pasta and marinara???? really????

    "text": "Tried today for first time after church. We were first table there and ordered quickly. Nothing special ordered--a margherita pizza, two cups of soup, salad and cheeseburger. Soups were bowls (guess they don't sell a cup), served quickly along with one salad (one party's entree).  Then we saw other tables order, be served and finish their meals before we received notification, after flagging down a manager, that our other two entrees were to be out shortly. We saw one sitting in the window for about 10 minutes and were curtly corrected by manager that it was only  2 minutes and it was plenty hot. Finally, 40 minutes after ordering, the cheeseburger still warm, and the pizza arrived. Pizza was icky, and was not liked by any of us. We were told that since it took so long to get to us (which we were curtly instructed again that pizza takes time to cook---excuse me but I worked in a pizza restaurant and know it doesn't take FORTY MINUTES), my friend was given a coupon to discount a future meal. She lives about 25 miles from the restaurant and said she wouldn't be back; asked manager for a discount instead and said if he would provide customer service she would not give a bad review. He was very short with us and said the coupon was all he would do and walked away, knowing that most of the pizza was left and that some of it was burnt. We were stunned at this manager's rudeness. Paid the bill and left and WILL NEVER RETURN.  And, we know plenty of people across the valley and are long-time, well-connected residents. We will advise people to stay away, unless they want mediocre food and a rude management. Our waiter was fine, and probably embarrassed to be working there.",

The lunch menu was limited, but I finally settled on the wood fired sausage and goat cheese pizza. The mezzo. My wife had the chicken parm. My daughter wanted fettuccine alfredo, but it wasn't on the menu. I asked if the chef could make that. The server went to ask and informed us that yes they could. Very nice I thought. I really enjoyed the waitress, because she was attentive to us, and when I pointed out that 2 of our forks were dirty before we even used them she had us clean ones asap. Our food arrives and my pizza was a big letdown. I do not know how that could of been a wood fired pizza. It was tasteless, and could of been a frozen pizza. My daughters fettuccine alfredo tasted like milk.. Warm milk on fettuccine. Not good. I only ate one piece of the pizza. My wife's chicken parm was surprisingly good with no complaints. I really cannot ever see myself ever coming back. Not worth my hard earned money when there are so many different better options out there.",

    "text": "Brought my friend for her early birthday dinner and decided to take the risk as she loves her Italian fare.  Being a big Chicago Foodie and taking another Chicago foodie, I had my hesitation based on other yelp reviews. I have to say, we all loved this place and find this as a hidden gem close to us.  We had the portabello appetizer and an antipasto salad.  The portabello was so good and rich enough to be a pasta dish itself and the antipasto salad that was for two people, but enough for six.  I had the eggplant parmesan and it wasn't as fresh as I would like and was disappointed.  The meat lasagna was phenomenal and taste homemade.  The chicken parmesan was really fresh and the meat was real tender.  Even for a person who doesn't like chicken parmesan, I would consider ordering it myself next time.  Didn't have desserts as the entrees itself was so rich and filling.  Will have to try pizza next time and venture into dessert.  Our waiter was very courteous and attentive.  He kept coming around and did a phenomenonal job to make sure the drinks were filled and unused plates were bussed.  I don't know why the reviews were rated poorly and I'm glad that my friend enjoyed her experience here and will forgo other Italian restaurants.  Knowing good food and service as a Las Vegas transplant from Chicago, I will not hesitate to bring out of town guests here myself.",

Yes, the place is beautiful, but with 12 customers in the place already served it took AN HOUR to get our food! We had to leave when a couple came in after us and was served before us. Their remark was it takes time...we bought our steaks and cooked them ourselves. I also hated the fact that we went back in February and it was freezing inside, so I kept on my heavy jacket. To sum it up, we were cold, food took over an HOUR, and we still went home hungry. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!",

First came the calamari which tasted very rubbery, hard to chew, and probably overcooked or maybe reheated leftovers (literally it was the worst I've ever ate). Then came the entrees... my entree was mediocre and the girlfriend said hers was gross, I tried hers and sure enough it was terrible. I kept offering her to eat my dish instead but she didn't enjoy my dish either. I felt terrible considering I had suggested this place. To make things worse, the server never visited our table after delivering our entrees and both of our drinks went empty and stayed that way. I had to flag down a random waitress multiple times because our server decided to inventory the bar instead of tending to his patrons. Then, to top it off, they gave us the wrong bill! I highly recomend going to ANY other italian restaurant if thats what you are in the mood for.",

    "text": "My husband and I went for dinner recently after looking for a new place. We had heard good things about it from our friends and Yelp reviews.  For an appetizer, we ordered the portobello mushroom baked in cream with four cheeses and served over raw spinach. It was an unusual dish, but delicious.  My husband kept the plate so he could use the bread to soak up the cheesy sauce. The portions are huge.  I could have ordered the mushroom appetizer as my main entree and been completely satisfied.  My husband ordered veal marsala (again, huge portions).  Pretty good. I ordered the Mona Lisa pizza, a thin crusted pizza with cheeses and vegetables (no red sauce).  Again, portions were huge. The pizza was amazing-- thin crust, light, with vegetables cooked to perfection. It was a work of art.  They only serve beer and wine (and they have some nice wines).    Service was great. Sean the owner was there and checked on us several times. We will be back again. Prices very reasonable, particularly given the portion size.  Nice ambiance.",

Our waiter was named Steve and we actually walked out. I ordered a glass of wine to start and Steve walked up and poured some wine in my glass from a small carafe which splashed, he did not look at us or say a word, rude. He came back after a while and took our order. We never saw him again, did not fill our water or check with us at all. I noticed other tables who arrived after us had their full meals while we just sat and waited for Steve to bring us ours, we tried to make eye contact with him to no avail. It is True the owner was at the table next to ours (with his back to us, two feet from our table) chatting with the customers, I believe he is the new owner. We never talked with him because we never got our meal!!! After 25 minutes we decided to leave and go somewhere else. We will never go back to mezzo bistro where the service is horrible, I can't say anything about the food but to me service should be above average with the prices they charge. I truly am sorry mezzo has new owners, I don't think they will survive long ESP with waiters like Steve. I give one star for the parking lot it is easy access",

The menu has some very unique choices but we went traditional with a chicken piccata and a house salad. It was the best piccata I've had!  The chicken breast which was carefully trimmed,  was cooked perfectly, very juicy and tender and the sauce was full of flavor with large, beautiful capers. The infused vinegarette dressing was delicious; a blend of herbs and spices left behind a subtle bouquet with a fresh flavor I had not tasted before in a dressing. We also enjoyed Tobin James-one of our favorite Zins!  It is great to have an inviting white table cloth restaurant in the area that is easy on the wallet and the senses!",

Our waiter did not seem to have great knowledge about the menu but what he lacked in knowledge he made up for in eagerness to help and friendliness. It had a very nice, laidback vibe and the decor was very pleasant. We ordered the antipasto and it was huge. I think it is the perfect size to share between 4 people. I had the filetto gorgonzola (I decided on the 8 oz over the 5 oz) and it was really good - it was affordable ($28), the gorgonzola was very good, and the filet was cooked perfectly. My fiancee ordered the orrechiette housemade pasta (around $14) and it was very good although the texture was a little different (not melt in your mouth and somewhat thick). It had a good spicy flavor since he chose to get Italian sausage instead of sweet sausage. We were too full by the end of dinner to have dessert but each had an espresso. I would recommend going here. The food is good and very affordable, the wait staff is very attentive, they have a $10 corkage fee if you want to bring in your own wine, and this place has a really nice vibe. I will definitely be going back here!",

Upon entering we were greeted by a extremely friendly server with a complete knowledge of the menu. The service was spot on and the bistro itself was very clean and comfortable.   I have now eaten there several times, and have yet to be disappointed. My first experience I had the veal piccata with a side of rigatoni in a great gravy (Jersey) and a delicious side salad served with a strawberry and great vinegarette dressing.   Since then I have discovered the antipasto, WOW the best I have ever had, hands down.  I need to start trying other items but the last few times we all seem to share the antipasto, a margharita pizza with buffalo mozzarella cheese and an order of the \"chicken riggies\"  are the best. My fellow employees ordered pasta fagloli and eggplant pram, and are stroll raving about how good and fresh it was.   The owners and management are pouring their heart and soul into this operation and it shows. If you get the chance make sure you stop in, I promise you'll be back if you do!!",

I've been about five times and it has always been good.  I've had some really GREAT service and some average service, but never bad service. I love that they are on Groupon.  In facrt, I think I may have a groupon sitting in my blackberry waiting to be used - the groupon, not the blackberry. The blackberry is happy to rest.  I have had pasta, chicken, fish, and I think veal.  Gotta find that Groupon and get some veal. My favorite meal is the roastd veg dish. It is meant to be an appetizer, but it is huge and delicous, I like it as an entree.  Last time, I added a piece of salmon, which they did differently for me since I don't like blackened.  I'm adventurous at life, but not so much with food - just learning to eat with a little heat.  Anyway, they did a simple salmon, cooked well as I don't like it rare. Don't judge me, it's the restaurant you are interested in, not me.  Back to the veg - exquisite - asparagus, peppers, zucchini, and beautiful roasted tomatoes! Fantastic!  Stop eating your entreee at about the half way point so you have room for dessert.  I love their coffee! I would love to splurge on the chef's dinner.  The chef selects the menu.  it's a special deal.  Maybe for my birthday, which is coming if you are interested. Do yourself a favor, try out Mezzo. Where's my blackberry, gotta find that groupon!",

Order appetizer meatballs which had a great balance of flavors.  Ceasar salad was great not over powering with a good balance of dressing...just right mixture. Entree of chicken marsala  took longer than anticipated as the table next to me who sat after got their entree first. Cheese bread came after entree and not together. Marsala very tasty and came with a bed of noodles. No dessert to full. I observed many return customers. If the entree didn't take too long I would have rated 5 stars as well as the bread came after I finished the first half of my meal. Server said they burnt the first order. My disappointments is that a restaurant this caliber should have grated parmigiano and the garlic cheese bread needs some help...something in the frozen section  tastes a lot better.",

The restaurant itself is the only remarkable thing in it's shopping center, smack in the middle with a terrace for additional seating. The atmosphere is very nice, with white paper tablecloths and faux candles on each table. Because of it's intimate design, with close together tables and soft lighting, this place is ideal for a date.   Once we were seated, our waiter came almost immediately to take our drink order. They offered a wine list, but we declined. Most of their wines were well priced, however. Our drinks were brought swiftly, and then our waiter told us the specials for the day, printed on a large blackboard at the back of the restaurant. The appetizer we ordered was a bruschetta with various cheeses (honey goat cheese, for example) paired with either a fruit or a meat. I didn't care for the shrimp and mascarpone cheese one, but my boyfriend loved the strong fish flavor. The others were absolutely delicious, and the drizzle of balsamic reduction over the small salad in the middle made the plating beautiful. They also bring you fresh bread, which was absolutely divine. It comes with an oil and vinegar dip with a squeeze of lemon that was delicious and, sadly, I filled up on bread before my entree even came. (No regrets, the bread was just too good.)  The entrees were amazing. Absolutely divine. I had read some reviews of the restaurant that scared me a bit, saying that the food was overpriced, but I can't say I agree at all. My boyfriend got one of their specialty pizzas, well priced at fourteen dollars, and it was plenty big for two people, let alone one. The pizza came with salami, prosciutto, and jalapenos, but I sadly can't remember all of the ingredients. I got the chicken 'Riggies', rigatoni pasta with chicken, peppers, and a marinara sauce, spicy level 2 (out of 4). It was a ridiculously large portion, oozing with mozzarella cheese and perfectly cooked pasta. The flavor was great, and you could pick out all of the subtle flavors of the chicken, individual peppers, and the sauce. I have absolutely no complaints about any of the food from here, except that it ended at some point.   At one point during the meal, the co-owner came and talked with us about how we liked the food and the restaurant. He was wonderfully polite and quite the gentleman, and we left the place feeling very welcome and excited to come back.   The single complaint I have about this restaurant was that the music was a little too loud, but it was live, and she was a good singer, so it was fine. I'm so excited to go back and I hope you try Mezzo!",

Waiter recommended a very delicious wine to start our evening and the Moscato was perfect. I have nothing bad to say about this place, food was delicious, service was impeccable and the atmosphere is very romantic. I will frequent this place with my love for future evenings together without hesitation.",

It was outstanding! The steak melted in my mouth like butter. My hubby had the chicken parm which was paper thin and lightly breaded and cooked to perfection. The heaven was found in the creamy sea salted Carmel gelato! Mmmmmm! Our entrees took a minute, but the wine and the conversation was flowing, so we didn't mind a bit. And to top it off, our server, Stephanee, was spot on. So friendly and attentive. Excellent service and an excellent meal! Will be back again.",

We were greeted promptly when we arrived, and decided to have a seat at the bar for a glass of wine.  Stephanie took good care of us, and we were so pleased with her wine recommendation that we had ordered a second bottle later in the evening!  I had the veal special with mushroom risotto, and it was delicious.  Thanks perhaps to the second bottle of wine, I don't remember what anyone else had, but everyone complimented their food.  Service was spot on, too.  I am definitely going back!  This is an oasis in the otherwise dining-barren northwest!  If you're looking for a fine meal north of Cheyenne, it pretty much stands alone.",

My spouse and I went there for lunch yesterday and I loved the decor and our food was outstanding; however, the SERVICE was NOT up to par.  There was only one waitress working; however, it was not very busy.  She never refilled our drinks or got my second glass of wine or never even asked us if we wanted dessert.  She took forever to bring us the check too.  If it were busy and she were more personable, then maybe I'd cut her some slack, but she wasn't even apologetic.  With that being said, we'll give it another try because the food was great but hopefully the service will be better.",

    "text": "I would love to give this place at least 4 stars - Buuuuuut the service was horrid.  Starters included - house salad with an apple/pear vinaigrette and the Italian wedding soup.  The salad was crisp fresh greens with a sliced strawberry and ricotta - SKIP the chick peas on the plate, it threw the bitter/sweet taste south.  Wedding soup was tasty - till you near the bottom where the bowl was encrusted with grated SALTY cheese - WOO too much.  The back-server filled and when I say filled I mean FILLED a bowl with EVOO and maybe added a tablespoon of balsamic for our bread.  So much oil you couldn't reach the balsamic.  If you want water or butter you have to ask for it.  Dinner - 5 oz filet and the chicken piccata.  The filet was super tender and the pecorino romano garlic herb sauce on it was delicious - the \"garlic\" mashed potatoes lacked taste.  Chicken piccata, was tasty cooked thoroughly - too many capers...and it was served with a side of zesty marinara over ziti.  IMO - I would have complimented this dish with a garlic oil linguine.    Dessert - nothing thrilling, did not order, although the pizza frite seemed interesting - I'm sure it was their version of Zeppole or fried doughboys.  Service was pitiful - our server was also the host and had to be reminded TWICE food was ready to be delivered.  His hand skills are lacking as well - he served our neighboring table a bowl with his thumb in it.  Gross.  Price wasn't too bad - $55.00 for a party of two - that was with soft drinks and no dessert.  We made a reservation, which was unnecessary as the restaurant was quiet.    Would I go there again?  Yes, in comfy jeans, to sit at the wine bar and order a wood fired pizza. :)",

Great happy hour specials too. I had the vegetable lasagna and BF had spaghetti, we were both completely stuffed between that and sharing a bottle of wine. Bartender was nice but in a little over her head, would have been nice to have some additional waitstaff as we waited almost 20 minutes after our meal was concluded just to pay. Still, I would definitely recommend this spot to my north town friends to try.",

Food was about a 4 out of 5 stars. It was a pretty basic menu so didn't take forever to decide what to get. Service was horrible though. After we ordered our food we didn't see our waitress again for over 40 minutes... Or I should say she kept walking right by my table with her eyes locked forward and didn't even stop when I called to her to get her attention on 2 separate occasions. They weren't even busy. I kept hearing the other servers claim they were upset cause they didn't have anymore tables to sit. I eventually flagged down a different waiter and asked him if he could just get our check. He then was very helpful and bagged our leftovers, ect. But of course she was all smiles as she brought over our check after not speaking to us a single time after she took our order, but didn't once mention anything about not serving us.  If the service had been better I would have done 4 stars and come back again, but I'd rather go to Olive Garden or bucca de bepo and get great/friendly service.",

I had the the seared Shampagne Chicken with angle hair pasta in a champagne reduction and my husband had the Veal Scallopini with brandy sauce and risotto.

So on to the food - I had the Filletto Gorgonzola and my girlfriend had the Double Thick Bone-in Chop.  I got the 5 ounce fillet mignon because I wasn't super hungry, but I felt $24 was a bit high for a steak that size.  It came with grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes as well as a gorgonzola sauce - everything was delicious and the steak was nice and tender, although I seem to remember the menu mentioned \"crispy prosciutto\" being a part of the entree but there was no sign of it on my plate.  My girlfriend's pork chop was also very tasty and the tenderest pork chop I've ever had.  It had a delicious peppery (as in hot/sweet peppers, not black pepper) sauce.  The only downside for her was that she asked for no mushrooms and got them on the plate anyway.  The food was delicious, my only complaint being that there was a bit of a wait between ordering and getting our food and finishing and getting our check.  I didn't really mind though because all the staff was hustling and everyone was helping every table that needed anything and we always had bread. I hope they're being paid well - I've read some of the less than stellar reviews for this place and feel like they must have gone to a different restaurant.  Also our waiter comped our sodas for the wait without us ever complaining which I felt was nicely done.  I'll definitely be back to Mezzo's I'm on that side of town",

Our entrees were eggplant parmesan, a family recipe of the chef, prepared without breading that we found to be both ample and delicious.  I used a $25 certificate purchased at a discount from a local radio station.  12/08 The owner/chef once owned the highly regarded, now defunct, Marc's Italian Steakhouse, but sold it a few years back and opened the slightly larger Mezzo.  We ordered pasta faglioli - family style, but were informed the kitchen was out of it this evening, so we settled on minestrone listed as a special.  It was reasonably good, but the portion size was exceptionally small and a total rip off at $7 per bowl.  Ms. Westie's entree was a very large portion of eggplant parmesan, a family recipe, prepared without any breading. I chose the spinach lasagna with a tomato vodka sauce which was equally bountiful and delicious.",

    "text": "Our first mistake was deciding on where to go for dinner a little late in the evening. When we arrived I was super hungry. We had two servers, neither of which could seem to serve us with any decency in speed or clarity. By the time our food arrived, I felt like I had already been in the restaurant way too long. There were quite a few other patrons in the place, but it wasn't packed with a wait to be seated.   My second mistake was assuming that Tea is unflavored. No, it's Passion Fruit Tea. Adam Carolla has a rant about Passion Fruit Tea, and I am thinking of joining his Army after my experience at Mezzo. All she had to do was to give me a heads up. Heck, I might have even ordered it even knowing, but when I took a sip of my tea, expecting a familiar taste only to find that I had been fooled.   My food was good, but maybe it was just because I was so starved by the time it arrived that I would have enjoyed a shoe just as much.   I can say ONE positive thing about Mezzo, and it's that their Pizza Frittes dessert is PHENOMENAL! They're fried dough bites with powered sugar, similar to bits of funnel cake. I ordered mine to go (since we had been there so long that I felt like I had moved into the place), and they piled them high in the take out box. They were even good the next day. I would go back to Mezzo just for the Pizza Frittes but definitely get them to go....without the tea.",

I thought they would at least place it in the regular menu but it turned out to not be a problem because my daughter knew exactly what she wanted and luckily they make it in small portion. She ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, I ordered the chicken marsala, and my husband ordered the chicken riggies, spicy.  Everything was good and my husband's riggies was very spicy.  The wine list was decent,  and in all, a good experience. The only issue I have is the cost.  I felt that the food was good, but not worth the cost.

    "text": "My husband and I had dinner at Mezzo's last Sunday night at the suggestion of our old friend who lives in Vegas and whom we wanted to treat.  The prices are exorbitant for the food quality and  service.  For starters, the prosciutto on the sampler appetizer \"for two\" had a bad smell, the \"fresh\" Mozzarella (not) perched atop a slice of under ripe tomato and the calamari was greasy.  The Frutti Di Mare seafood pasta used dried pasta that was too al dente and the seafood was overcooked to the point of being dry or tough.  The skimpy glasses of wine were $10 or more.  If we had been alone, we would have sent back food starting with the appetizer and we certainly won't return the next time we visit our friend in Vegas.  There are many, many great restaurants in Vegas but this is not one of them !!",

My wife and I found this place on a lark one Friday night after a long week and we were immediately hooked.  The decor is inviting and classy, but not overwhelming.  One side of the restaurant features a bar with a couple of TVs, but they aren't distracting from the rest of the place.    The wait staff is friendly, efficient and knowledgable in both the food and wine menus.  Daily specials are consistently unique and delicious and the specialties of the main menu are the Gorgonzola Filet, Orecchiette & Sausage and the Roasted Pork (it's about 2\" thick and you can cut it without a knife).    Bottom line: The service and food is on par with MUCH more expensive restaurants at a reasonable price (about $50 for 2 entrees and wine).",

    "text": "We had heard via a friend the Mezza was a nice, new bistro with good wine, so when our original plans to try Indian fell through and we found ourselves in the area, we decided to try it. The decor is typical Italian bistro-ish and nicely lit. The music choice and volume were appropriate for the decor and time of day. We were seated promptly and looked at the menu boards by the kitchen for the specials. My friend was right, the wine list is great! While not extensive by the glass....very reasonable and anyone would be able to find something suited to their palate and price range. We asked what the ($6) house red was and were informed it was our choice of Tobin James Cabernet or Merlot. These were on the menu at $10 a glass, so I clarified what the house red was and got the same answer. I got the cab and my partner got a glass of Fat Cat Pinot. Both were lovely and we both ordered a second glass of the cab (especially at the price!)  We ordered the Mediterranean salmon and the Baked Portobello appetizer, but as an entree over linguine. The salmon was plated beautifully and was nice....not out of this world, but edible and seasoned appropriately. A bowl was brought for the mussel shells and sauce was tasty, but not epic and not Ginas!  The Portobello plate came with no spinach and was sloppily presented, like they slid it on the plate in a hurry and it barely made it on; no garnish and the plate not wiped. The 4 cheeses were very, very rich and the dish was salty (probably owing to all the cheese) but tasty, especially once I asked for the spinach which they wilted perfectly and cut the richness down to a tolerable level.  Service started well and overall no major complaints except when we needed wine or the spinach it took a quite a few minutes to get our server's attention. In his defense, the place filled up with large tables (good for them, nice to see it is popular) and those take time, so we understood. I think I would have staffed one more bus person/food runner to help keep things going to the table, water filled up, etc. We did notice food sitting at the kitchen counter for quite awhile...luckily it wasn't ours!  Bill was reasonable ($65 for 2 people) even though we were actually charged $10 a glass for the wine, not the $6, but it was delicious and one glass was left off.....so no complaints:)  We might  come back for the wine and some appetizers, and depending on the service and food then might bring friends for a casual dinner that is close to home. If you are in the area, it is worth a stop and I think when the patio opens in the summer it will be even better!",

We went on a busy Friday night, they had a wedding party and you could see the entire staff was busy. The wait staff was fantastic on keeping the bread and drinks coming till the food arrived. We sat at the table by the kitchen and were drooling over the antipasta plate. We made a promise to the kids to get one next time.  I had the lasagna, the portion was huge and the flavor was ammaaaaazing. Our son had the orecchietta, and he wanted to lick his plate. My fiance had the Tuscan Tenderloin and there was not a drop left on his plate to lick. With the leftovers we brought home it fed us for another meal. My mother had the eggplant parmigiana and her portion was just as big as my lasagna and her's had a bowl of pasta on the side. It could have fed 3 easily!  All in all, the place was rocking, not a table open and the staff did an amazing job keeping everyone happy.",

    "text": "The 2 stars are for the food. That's the only thing about this place that was positive.  We came here to celebrate the engagement of friends on a Saturday night. There were 12 of us. 12 people (military), new to Vegas, that would most likely come eat here again and tell other people to come here if it was a good place to eat.  From the beginning our server was rude. When asked if something was good he responded \"yeah... it's all good.\".  I asked if he had any crackers as we had a squirmy 9 month old with us. He says \"No. No crackers.\" Finally after 10 more minutes of more whining I desperately ask if they have anything, even bread. That's when he brings out the bread for the table. Clearly he was not going to bring that out unless we asked for it. Nice. Don't get me wrong, I know I should have brought my own food for the baby, but I wouldn't have cared if the server even just said \"no, sorry, we don't have crackers.\" He was just so short with us, it was offensive.  There was a girl assisting him in refilling drinks, etc. Our drinks were refilled once and were never touched again.  The thing that weirded us all out was when we ordered entrees the server said \"soup or salad?\" So we all picked our soup or salad. One of the peple with us asked him \"what kind of salad is it? Is it Ceasar?\" and he says \"yeah you can have that if you want.\" At this point I was confused and asked what kind of salad we ordered and he said whatever we wanted, yet he didn't have us specify when we said salad. That's when it came to our attention the entrees didn't come with a side, he was just upselling and being extremely sneaky about it.  Oh yes, and he corrected my husband on the proper pronunciation of the dish he ordered. Very professional.  When we ordered I asked for separate tickets.  The food came out relatively fast. It was good. We were never asked if everything was good.   Finally it was time to pay. He brought out one separate ticket and then grouped the other 9 people on one ticket, even though I asked for them to be divided when we ordered. When the other people asked for him to divide it he told us \"nobody but them asked for separate tickets.\"  The gratuity was not added to our ticket and I only tipped 10%. The other people we were with did that same, if not less. After rudely collecting the tip slips before we were close to leaving, he slams down the girl's share of the money (for helping him) and she said \"THANKS\" (loudly) and glared at our table. Oh, that reminds me. They were shining silverware during the meal and I watched her pick something off our server's face as she had silverwear in one hand. After she was done getting his eyelash or whatever it was she went right back to touching the silverware. I wanted to gag.   I have been a waitress. I know the job isn't easy, especially when you have bigger tables. But the place was pretty much dead on a Saturday night (I now understand why) and this guy didn't try, at all.  I don't think we will be back. And that makes me sad because that margherita pizza was damn good. So was the antipasto salad.  Bad service just ruined that entire experience.",

First off, it is obvious that the \"regulars \" get exceptional service, you get seated immediately,  waited on quickly and your food in a reasonable amount of time.   We went in early and the place was busy, no doubt.   We didn't have a reservation but we were seated in 15 minutes or so.  Now minaad you, the \"regulars\" that came in 5 minutes after us already had their appetizers and were eating.  We ordered our meals and a salad, nothing too complicated.   We got our bread  but the salad took a good 15 minutes.   After another 40 minutes we finally received  our food.  The pasta was dry and lukewarm and the chicken barely had any sauce.   It was only after putting our plates down did we get an apology for the wait.  Our first experience was amazing which is why we raved about it and brought family with us for them to try.  Needless to say, they could not believe that we actually had such a good experience our first time and sadly, they left unimpressed .  There is a difference between slow service and poor service.   Slow service can be excusable,  poor service cannot.",

Their ac is down so it was really hot throughout the meal but other than that everything was really great.  They're not too expensive either, with an awesome happy hour/lunch menu.

You can find better bread in Albertsons. So sorry the food was not better here. If the above problems are resolved I'd like management to let me know and I'll try it again.",

Both were prepared perfectly (which alot of places dry out the prawns) and the fried green tomatoes were perfect.  I had the grilled cheese with gouda and grilled onions/mushrooms. Absolutely fantastic.  My friend tried the shrimp and chicken alfredo and I have to tell you it rates near the top of best alfredo sauce I have had.

I didn't make it half way through dinner before grabbing my phone and buying another Groupon! The decor is beautiful, cozy, and warm and they have bar seating as well as indoor dining and an outdoor patio. You are never rushed either, we love to sit outside and enjoy some wine and the amazing food! This is a must go!",

Anyone who has had a caprese salad knows you get heirloom tomatoes, soft mozzarella, basil, and balsamic vinegar. I've had buffalo mozzarella many times and this was not it. The mozzarella was something Walmart sales. The tomatoes where standard tomatoes. It was all cut so thick that i had to use a knife. Flavor was terrible. Then I found bell peppers on my plate.

    "text": "We bought a Groupon lunch for Mezzo since we had wanted to try it for a while now. Our first visit was Tuesday March 3. Service was good, food was very good and way too much for a lunch. The only negative was a dirty bread plate which was replaced promptly.  We wanted to go back last night, March 6, for some drinks and appetizers. We didn't want to take up a table for this so when we walked in we told the greeter that we just wanted some drinks and appetizers and hoped to sit at the bar. There were only a couple of empty seats and they were not together.  His response as he pointed to an empty chair at the bar, \"There's one there. Knock yourselves out.\" His tone and body language were dismissive. He then turned to someone else.  We could not believe that this guy was that rude to a potential customer. We left.  Apparently, they do not need nor want new business and they will certainly not be getting ours.",

He was very friendly, new the menu well, and evening though it was super busy, he never once forgot about us.    My husband, and I tried the risotto balls, they were everything you could want in an app.  For our main I had the prositto wrapped halibut, and my husband had the fire grilled pizza, with goat cheese, and sausage, both were incredible.  They have a T.V. by the bar, and one on the other size of the room, so that everyone can see what is going on in T.V. land.  Great place, and will be back for more.",

The Chicken Parmesan was two nice sized pieces, crisp on the outside juicy and tender on the inside with just enough sauce and cheese so as to not over power the dish.  I would recommend Mezzo Bistro to anyone that wants a good local place on the west side.",

Mezzos also has weekly specials and wine pairings not to mention ladies night and happy hour. You will not be disappointed. I dine here ofren, and consider this my home away from home.

    "text": "I have been there on two separate occasions, and both times were, well.....meh.   The atmosphere is certainly top notch. We had the little private room for my buddy's birthday, and we had a large table on the second occasion, both were comfy, and we had about 10 people both times. The entire restaurant is set-up very tight for seating, which is actually nice for a small place, it is almost homey, that part I like.  The staff is good. The waiter we had the first time seemed like he was certainly new at his job, when someone asked the specials he fumbled around a bit, but he was quick on his toes and provided good service. I wish I could remember the waiter we had in the evening, he was easily one of the best waiters I have ever had. He knew everything there, very knowledgeable about wines (it IS a wine bar) and the menu, very enthusiastic.   The food is ok, could step it up a bit for the price. My wife and I both had specials of the evening. I had Chilean sea bass, which just tasted like fish, nothing outstanding. My wife had prime rib that was pretty good. My prior visit I had meat lasagna, which tasted good, but was basically a bowl of melted cheese, while my wife had chicken piccata, which was pretty good.   The coffee was not good. This may be nit-picky, but I really put a big emphasis on good coffee, and there's was not good coffee. And it wasn't hot. Coffee is one of those things that I like to order after my meal, and really seals the deal for me as to the quality of the establishment.  My biggest beef with this place was when we were basically handed our hat when trying to order desert. The waiter told us his manager wanted to box up our desserts upon ordering and send us on our way because of a wedding party that was coming in. I told them that we would certainly NOT pay for desserts in a box, when we could just go down the street and grab something for a quarter of the price. The waiter clearly felt like a jerk, he said straight up that was not right, he was just doing his job. Then the manager came over and apologized, gave us a little discount, handed us some coupons, and sent us on our way. We discovered in the parking lot that the coupons all expire within a couple of weeks, too. Our check was over $300, and we were hustled out the door. U n a c c e p t a b l e.",

Most recent visit on a Saturday nite.(I should have gotten the groupon=as I'm sure many had one.  A jazz band was playing drowning out my conversation.  $12, 6 oz glass of Heritage Cab, grilled Asparagus, 2 meatballs, wedge salad, PASTA fagioli (pasta with bean soup). Bread with oil and balsamic was OK.  Wedge salad with blue cheese. It was drizzled with balsamic , 2 sprinkles of crumbled bacon.  It was good.  Grilled asparagus  drizzled with more balsamic was barely warm.  Pasta fagioli was a bowl of beans with about 2 tablespoons of tomatoey broth and NO PASTA in it and it was highly spiced. I sent it back for more broth. I pointed this out to the waiter and he said \"sometimes the chef puts more beans in and only a little pasta\".  Weird.  The meatballs were very good.

I asked if we'd have to wait long? kelly wasn't sure. i asked kelly just for an approximate idea of a wait time as we were coming from the other side of town and really didnt feel like standing around for an hour just to be seated. usually when we go to a restaurant we're ready to dine when we get there. Of course when you also have a reservation, you just figure you'll be seated fairly quickly.   I asked to speak to a manager to see if maybe they could give me an idea of a wait time, maybe just an average time based on the regular attendance for that particular day of the week ? SOMEBODY ?? ANYBODY ??  well Kelly once again with her VERY uncertain and poor customer service/unsure attitude, She said MAYBE one could call me back. Maybe ?? Well.....it is now December 7th 2017 and still no call back. Completely ok as there are no shortage of great restaurants in this town and 10 TIMES BETTER THE CUSTOMER SERVICE I EXPERIENCED WITH MEZZO.    i just felt the need to point out the horrible customer service i received.   MEZZO BISTRO, you can thank Kelly for this review. Cheers P.S. the only reason you got 1 star is because i'm unable to post review without giving at least 1, but rest assured i wanted to put minus 1 star.",

Not to mention, their AC was out so it was extremely warm in there and then the power went out and we sat in the dark for over half of our meal. My biggest annoyance was that we were very calm and pleasant during the horrible experience, and they wouldn't event take anything off of our bill to accommodate. Considering the experience they gave, yo uh would think that was the least they could do. Wont be going back.",

My daughter and I shared a salad caprese and the salmon mediterranean. The salad was fresh and the dressing flavorful. The salmon pasta was deliciously paired with a glass of 19 crimes.  We finished dinner with the creme brule for the table and a cheesecake to go. Both desserts were delightful. I enjoyed a glass of desert wine, a port 20, I believe.   We truly appreciate the kind service and attentive staff. The food is always a crowd pleaser.   Looking forward to dinner night with the hubby soon. (Hope to see some heaters on the patio soon.)

We had the bartender young girl wait on us and she was very inattentive and acted like she wasn't really interested in waiting on us. I asked her several times for lemon and sugar for my tea. She didn't bring them. I asked for bread she said they are baking some more bread and we would have to wait. It was 5:00 on a Saturday night the place was empty and they had no bread. My husband ordered a pizza that came out burnt on the bottom . The waitress seemed like we were bothering her. The owner came over and said that was unacceptable and offered to give my husband another meal which was not free and we were charged after all the hassle we went through I will definitely not recommend this place. If they can't get a pizza right imagine the rest of the food. I also will be spreading the word about this place as I am a city worker. Too bad the owner had to be so greedy and not care about doing anything about all our problems except replacing his meal and charging him full price . Don't waste your money here . Carabbas and macaroni grill are much better and cheaper too.",

We made a reservation as required on open table and put notes in that we were celebrating our anniversary. Not one time did anyone even acknowledge that it was our anniversary. The bar tender was our server as well as the hostess until the owner came in around 6. Our server never told us what the specials were he just sat us and then came back and asked if we were ready to order. He didn't even ask what we wanted to drink. It's sad because the food here is so amazing, the Groupon brings people in but they won't return unless you have great service as well.",

Recently, they did do an upcharge for the mashed potatoes, but the serving size was large. The food tastes fresh and the portions are large. They also serve a bread that has a unique, subtle herbal flavor. I like the bottled orange cream soda as an alternative to a fountain drink. Creme Brule is a yummy option for dessert. They torch it at the table which allows you to choose the crispness of the top.    A bonus is they often have Groupons which helps your dining dollars stretch further!",

And when the pizza was the last thing left on the table and the server asked if we wanted it to go and we told him no because it was awful, he didn't even offer any kind of concern to show he cared. Usually you at least offer a fake apology that the food wasn't what you expected. We ordered two appetizers and four entrees so we got a pretty good feel for the food, and overall not the worst Italian I've ever had but we also won't be going back.",

Yes there is a wait sometimes, but it is worth it.  The waiters are busy but always very courteous.  There is a lot of team work going on as several members tend to your table.   The food is excellent!  Very authentic and made from scratch.  We tried the hot antipasto and WOW is was delicious.  The pasta dishes are huge portions and they don't skimp on the sauce.  Even thought there is a bit of a wait for the food ( we just enjoy an extra glass of wine) the food arrives hot.   We also had Tiramisu for dessert, which is made fresh daily and you can taste the difference.   The ambiance is very intimate.  Tables and booths well placed and great for family gatherings or a romantic evening.  Order your mean kick back enjoy a drink and listen to the music while they prepare a wonderful and authentic Italian meal.  We are fans of live music.  We will go out of our way to support any establishment that features live music.  This is Vegas and yet most places are not able to support what is an important part of the the Vegas culture.  Last night we enjoyed the Hartline Trio.  The singer was excellent and just right for the room.  We have also enjoyed other featured bands and vocalist that add to the ambiance of the room.    We will continue to visit this establishment and recommend it highly.",

Tonight we had a reisling with our meal, it was very good. Wine list here is huge and very good!  For an appetizer we had the sampler, it had shrimp, calamari, muscles, clams and fish in a wine and tomato sauce. With the warm sourdough bread to scoop up the broth, it was very good.   I had the sweet sauage with homemade pasta, very good, mushrooms, garlic and spinach. Still loving it today! My husband had the chicken madera, also very rich sauce, mushrooms and two big pieces of chicken served with pasta. Two very good dishes.   We had excellent service, food was fantastic and I recommend this place to one and all!",

The calamari was literally HALF the portion size that they always give (It's usually so big that we can't even touch our entrees because we are so full!).  I showed it to the owner/manager and he agreed with me so they gave us more, but seriously?  I hope that they aren't going to start being skimpy on their food portions because this is actually a great restaurant! Their food is always delicious and on point. The Caesar salad was good, but it was smaller than usual.  I just hope that next time we go back to Mezzo their portions are back to normal size!",

Hard to screw up cheese, tomato and basil. It was good. Now back to our entrees... The veal was good albeit a tiny portion for the money. My wife's chicken was tender and flavorful... but for the love of Pete, how does and Italian bistro SCREW UP PASTA???? It was so over cooked, it was almost paste-like. When we told the waiter, he simply asked if we'd like another order of pasta. Nice gesture, but no thanks.  The ambiance is nice. The salad is acceptable. The entrees with paste like pasta... not so great!  Be mindful of what you order if and when you go there.",

My husband and I had a great experience, and I'm sure we will be returning, even at full price.  It was prom night, so the place was pretty packed, but we were seated right away, even without a reservation. We each had a house salad ($5 each), which was nothing special, and we split a bottle of good Chianti ($36). I had the veal parmesan ($24), which was tasty and served with a large portion of penne pasta. Sauce was a little plain, but the meat was cooked nicely.  The standout of the meal was my husband's fettucine alfredo ($16, or free for us with the coupon). Whenever we try a new Italian restaurant, that's his standard order to gauge the place, and he said this was among the best he's ever had. I tried a bite, and I would have to concur.  So the food was good and the prices were reasonable (especially when using a half-off coupon!). My only complaint is that it's a little dark inside. I could barely read the menu or see my food, even though it was daylight outside; I can't imagine it would be any better after sunset. Maybe next visit I'll bring along a flashlight!",

Four of us went for lunch at 1 p.m. last Tuesday.  I arrived before the others.  There were only a few tables occupied and there was no one at the front desk.  The bus boy saw me standing there and made eye contact, but didn't offer to help.  I waited at least 5 minutes and finally asked him if I could be seated.  Only three of us got water.  We asked for one more.  The bus boy walked right by with it in his hand.  We had to stop him and tell him it was for us.  Three of us ordered a glass of the same wine.  The wine he brought was not what we ordered, but we didn't notice at first.  The wine was good, so we didn't say anything, but you'd think the waiter could at least mentioned that they didn't have what we asked for.  He did let us have the full bottle for the price of three glasses.  I asked for a glass of ice.  Had to ask again after waiting over 10 minutes.  We had to ask for bread and after we emptied the basket, we were never asked if we'd like more.  All of us ordered salads.  We were expecting to get them before our entrees, even though the waiter didn't ask if we wanted them first.  Our salads and entrees arrived at the same time.  Three of us ordered the same entree.  After waiting an unusually long time for our food, only two got their entree.  Waiter said he thought we only ordered two.  One entree had a small piece of paper in the pasta. Neither the waiter nor bus boy ever came back after our food was served to ask if everything was OK or if we needed anything else.  One of us had to actually get up and yell to ask for salt and pepper and for parmesan cheese.  When we ordered we asked if it was possible to get separate checks and the waiter said yes.  Then he brought just one check!  We reminded him we asked for separate checks and he re-did them.  One of our group had eaten here previously and recommended it.  She said it was very good the times she had been there for dinner, and she was very embarrassed and disappointed in what we experienced at lunchtime.  If you want good service, don't go here for lunch! Hopefully the service is better at dinner time than it is for lunch.  Too bad, because I am always looking for a place with a semi-private or private room for a group of 10-12 that get together once a month for lunch. The food is good and their semi-private area would be perfect.",

Not that the place didn't look like it couldn't serve great food, for some reason I had a very cynical outlook about good Italian food in my neighborhood (89108). And boy was I wrong!   If you're a fan of standard well made Italian American fare then this place is for you, lots of old standards, nothing new or crazy that jumps at you, but that's okay. You get large portions of American classics and they're very reasonably priced.   I also had a latte there because I was feeling in a bit of a slump when I got there and it blew every chain latte I've ever had out of the water.   My only complaint is that their sides and small items seem a little pricey, but its entirely acceptable because of the large portions you get. My girlfriend ordered Spaghetti and Italian Sausage from the dinner menu ($15) and got two big filling meals out of it.   My Chicken Parmesan was some of the best I can remember having in quite a long time. If I ate it it one sitting I'd be ready to pop.   We sat outside and service was delightful. The servers were polite without being patronizing.   Thanks Mezzo. We shall return.",

Great food is the best reason to come here but service shouldn't suffer because they know it's worth waiting for. If your going to make me wait, please at least keep my cup full. Be willing to yell if you need something and continue to be patient. It will come.  Tonight wasn't a full house, just so so.  Remember your here for the food and then have an in depth conversation with the person your with. Just sit back and relax. Unless your hungry.",

    "text": "\"I know you can be overwhelmed, and you can be underwhelmed, but can you ever just be whelmed?\"  Bad movie reference, but I was definitely \"whelmed\" by my Mezzo Bistro dining experience. I went last Friday, and surprisingly there was no wait. We were seated immediately, and the waiter came along and told us about the specials. I did not get a chance to sample the bread, but the other girls ate every bit. I ordered the caprese salad appetizer and Pork Tenderloin with mashed potatoes instead of pasta.   The tomatoes in the caprese salad were anything but fresh. I ate around them, and enjoyed the cheese and basil. I did try the portobello mushroom appetizer as well, which was good if you're into mushrooms.  The pork tenderloin was awesome. Very moist and full of flavor. The only thing I didn't like was the portion. It was very tiny and costed about $19.  The service was really good. The space was a little crammed but there weren't many people there, so it wasn't too big of an issue. If you can get the Groupon, then go. If not, there are plenty of other places to eat with better food/prices.",

I didnt want to sit in the bathroom or hall.  Mgr. said they were cleaning, which was b.s.  Bottom line, I ordered veal and gf ordered chicken parmigiana. My veal was not white nor milk fed, was brown. Her chicken was a frozen, then burnt, devoid of cheese, 8 oz breast. For 24.00 an entree, a la carte we got shit. The 12.00 beet salad was a joke. The Blue Moon draft was not real cold. This place may of been good at one time, not now. DONT GO!  PS We saw the waiter one time, and then never again. I liked the busboy, he was only person who cared.",

I don't know how it was at her 99 other jobs, but apparently Passion Fruit Tea = Iced Tea in her highly experienced Career.  My Better Half was rather disappointed by this fact, since she assumed we knew by her answer to the question \"Do you have Sweet Tea?\" as \"We Have Iced Tea\".  Some might have said \"We have Passion Fruit Tea\" but 'fortunately' her experience convinced her otherwise.  Overall, an average Italian experience for me.  They allow you to chose your own level of spiciness on a scale of 1 to 4. I said 3, but I felt more like that was the piquance level for babies. But perhaps it was more that my Frutti Di Mare does not lend itself well to spiciness.  Our party of 6 had a bit of a wait for the food, and bread was not provided as quickly as would have been optimum, but overall a decent meal.  Nothing special, but not bad either.",

First of all, any of you been to this place, the tables are very close together.  So, after we were seated and ordered our food, another couple sat next to us.  Well, there was a guy talking to the other couple next for about 15-20 mins at a time, well he scooted between the tables and his BUTT was literally next to our appetizer, wine glass, and face.  He was so rude.  Not once he realize what he was doing, we scooted the table away from him, it just gave him more room to scoot towards us.  We kept moving it 'til it was joining the other table.  It was gross, completely ruining our evening.  To top things off, the lasagna was cold in the middle and really lacked flavor, so was the blackened salmon dish.  We did have a pretty good glass of wine, no question about that.  That was the only good thing out of that place.  After our meal, we mentioned it to the waitress, and she said the guy we were referring to was the owner.  You would think the owner would have been more courteous  towards his customers, but hey he's the owner.  If that's the way he wants to run his restaurant, then we are definitely not going back.  If you like the owner's BUTT in your face or the smell of BUTT, this is absolutely the best place to go all day long and would highly recommend it.  If this is your preference, please change my 1 star to 5 stars.",

The waiters never come around to check on your table nor are they easy to find and flag down. Once being seated it took the waiter 21 minutes to comeback to our table to take our orders. The restaurant wasn't busy at all. Maybe three tables were occupied.  They also have an outside sitting area that faces the parking lot so the time it takes to get served and have your bill delivered you can eat and hop right into your car and leave and I bet that they won't even know you're missing.  After we finished our meals it took the waiter another 15 minutes to bring our bill to us.  Overall, a great place to eat. A bit expensive but worth every penny. And make sure you have patience and a lot of time on your hands because you're going to be waiting forever on your meals, drinks, and service.",

My wife order a glass of moscato and it coast $11.00 a little over price. I ordered a beer, and that came out to $6.00 again over price. This restaurant has great food, but charges to much for appetizers and drinks. The service was good they brought out hot bread and they came by several times to check on us.",

We can sit by ourselves or sit at the bar.  Everyone is friendly and the food is always great!  They always try something new, and have a steady lust of old reliables.",
