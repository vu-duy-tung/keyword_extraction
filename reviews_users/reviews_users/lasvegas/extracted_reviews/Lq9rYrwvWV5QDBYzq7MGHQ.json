The late night menu is awesome.  Ultimate osaka roll, japanese lasagna and kai's special are my favorites.  You can get stuffed with the happy hour appetizers too.  Try the chicken wings, the kalbi sticks and the fried rice.  Oh and the udon too.  I am not sure why some prior reviews say this place is expensive.  In my opinion, this place is very reasonable and I have not been disappointed.   P.S. Green tea tiramisu is really good.  A little expensive at $8 for a slice but splurge once in a while.",

Also, splurge on their very special T-shirt that has a Sumo wrestler saying \"will work for sushi.\"  You'll get it after your Osaka addiction has begun.  At the end of your meal, ask for an Osaka frequent card since you can use it as a credit on your next meal!  Ok does everyone know to leave your shoes outside the tatami room with toes outward?

I have been here with friends on numerous occasions and have always managed to find something to eat without fish.  Having lived in Japan for years, I like to think my broken nihongo has a hand in me getting what I would like...  Love the Inari and the tofu soup was bland but not too bad.  The tea here is one of the reasons I like to come here..sooo tasty.    The Sake is great I had rice, cold, warm and flavored and enjoyed almost all of it.  Great to go with a group of friends, sit in the back on the tatami and drink, eat and be merry.  The waiter was kind of nice to give us the some remainders of open bottles since were shutting the place down.  A big bonus because it was normally not something I would order because of the expense.    The place is good for groups, and the seating is somewhat private so you can have a good time.  Like all tatami you can take your shoes off and sit cross legged which I love.",

    "text": "I stopped writing reviews on Yelp because it was too time consuming, but after eating at this restaurant, I can't help but tell the world about our experience, one that I hope will make other people wary of coming here.  We arrived at Osaka on a typical Saturday afternoon (1pm-ish) and was shown a table in the back room (where the tables were larger).  As we walked past the first room upon entering, I noticed that it was fairly empty but it didn't struck me as odd since there are so many restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas.  We sat down and were given multiple menus, each one with something different in it.  I guess this could be a good thing since I like having lots of choices.  We ordered our drinks (hot green tea and iced green tea) and browsed the menus for omakase, which we heard from someone (ahem) that it is worth coming here for.  After everyone in our party arrived (there were 5 of us), we asked the waitress about their omakase and she completely hesitated. I thought that was strange considering this should be a simple question.  She said she'll be right back, so we sat there, thinking maybe she's just new or something.  But even so... o_O.  She came back and in broken English asked us if we wanted sashimi or sushi, and we said a little of both.  She then proceeded to say that it's $100 for all four people that wanted it, and I confirmed if it was $100 per person, or if it was $100 for all four people because that makes a HUGE difference.  She said $100 for four people, so we agreed.  After ordering the \"omakase\" - I realized that she must have ordered us the plate of normal sashimi/sushi that was on the menu.  I remember seeing $50 for 2 people for something, so with 4 people, she just doubled it.  I thought sure... why not.  We were going to try their assortment of rolls, but given that the omakase is supposed to be good, I decided to give it a try.  The first plate of sashimi came out looking decent.  I'm not too familiar with the names and the translation for the type of fish, so I'm just going to say that I tried just about everything on the menu and only a couple items tasted okay.  There were quite a few nasty bites in between, including one in which I had to spit out.  Now, I'm not a sushi snob at all, but when I have to do that, it means it's NOT good.  My companions agreed, and another person had to go thru that ritual later on in the meal as well (said one of the fish tasted grainy too).  Fortunately, our napkins were right in front of us.  =)  As an additional note, we received 2 additional plates of sushi rolls which were supposed to be part of the omakase deal.  We thought it was just so-so as well... perhaps even bad.  At the end of the meal, we noticed the $100 + $70 on top of our other charges.  We asked about the $70 and they said it was for the 2 plates of sushi rolls that accompanied our sashimi omakase plate. Needless to say, that $70 was a surprise because we were told  it was $100 for four people.  If they told us they were going to bring additional sushi plates for $35 each, I think we would've either said no, or ordered or own rolls.  Ugh.  I hate when mess-ups like this happen.  We told our waitress about the issue and she left to talk to the owner/mgr.  The owner/mgr. came by quite awhile later to ask us what the issue was.  We explained clearly about the unexpected charge and the miscommunication but he wouldn't budge.  In fact, he brought up how good of a quality the fish were, and given that, this is still a good deal.  The whole time, I kept thinking if I should tell the truth about the quality of his fish, but I kept my mouth shut in case he was going to give us a break.  I suppose we all could've said something because at the end, nothing happened out of the negotiation.  He wouldn't even take the charge of one $35 plate of sushi off, so we paid, left, and vowed never to come back.    I've had a lot of sushi before, but I would rank this as the worst sushi AND experience ever.  There are a ton of other great sushi restaurants in Vegas, so look it up on Yelp and go there.  You will not regret it.",

Not awsome but not bad, meh.  Sushi Oh my God = wish I had gotten just this and the Cajun Crunch so that I could have eaten more of them before getting full. Will come back just for those next time.  Cajun Crunch = a little kick but not overwhelming heat. I could taste all the ingredients not just the spicy sauce so I was happy.   777 roll = if it wasn't for the 2 rolls listed above this would be my favorite. Did not over do it on the cream cheese and the sauce really worked well with the mild fish.  Fire Roll = good but not great, won't get it again in favor of other rolls.  Katie Maki = tasty and a little different from what I'm used too (haven't had a roll with mushroom in it before) but I would have liked a little more shiitake in there as it was a little hard to differentiate the flavor.  Yum Yum Roll = Hubby said this was his favorite from his previous trip so we ordered a whole roll (got half rolls of some of the above so we could try more) so when it came I was excited to try it. I was underwhelmed. It was fine, just a simple plain roll but compared to the other yummies on the table I didn't want to spare valuable stomach space on it. After a couple of pieces hubby did say that he must have remebered wrong about this roll.   Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream = I had no room for dessert but hubby had this and pronounced it \"so tasty\".   Our dining compainions don't do sushi so they got the terriyaki chicken and shirmp tempura and deemed them delecious.  I was a little nervous going in after reading reviews on here about bad service but I couldn't have been happier with our service. Plates were cleared quickly and drink were kept full and we felt well taken care of.   We will be back for sushi numminess soon.",

    "text": "My first experience with real sushi (not grocery store or deli counter sushi).  Loved every bite.  Even got adventurous and ate the face off of a giant shrimp creature.  Eyeball stalks, and all.  That may have been a garnish.  I don't know, it was also my first fling with the sake.  Speaking of sake...this is also the only place I've found that served a particular sake which was brewed by females, to cater to females.  Came in a frosted pink bottle.  Little bit sweeter than other sakes I've tried, but good...and the bottle looked precious, with a pretty flower stuck in, nestled on my girlfriend's nightstand.    I tried many new things, here.  Sashimi of various sorts, seaweed salad, eel sauce, tako and tamago...always attractively presented and delicious.  Went here several times over the years in Las Vegas.  Never had a meal I didn't thoroughly enjoy, never had a server who wasn't friendly and outgoing, never had any fellow guests complain about taking off their shoes, never had a menu recommendation that went unappreciated,   never had a check that raised my eyebrows.    My only beef with the place was the smell...the last few times I went, everything past the sushi bar smelled like a sewer.  Now, I managed food places for a long time, and I know that once there's a problem in the lines under the building, it can be a bear (a big, angry, expensive bear) to get taken care of.  But in a sit-down joint with aspirations towards the classy, aged poo cannot be allowed to waft.    SO...if someone can confirm for me that the smell has been taken care of (my nose now being several hours to the south), I'll bump this review up a notch.",

And even then they were out of a few beers. The waitress was not a bartender by any means. She was confused about the ingredients of basic cocktails.   The manager, who sits at the front door was in no way accommodating or friendly. We did not feel welcomed or comfortable upon our arrival. Perhaps it was the additional member of our party that upset him. We felt as if we were an inconvenience.   That being said, the food was good. We had the combination dinner with steak and seafood. The preparation and presentation were really nice. Our chef was humorous and entertaining. The food was hot and flavorful. The sauces were outstanding.  So, we were happy with the food and unhappy with the hospitality. That being said, we will try it again and hope we our experience will be better. Worth giving it a try!",

    "text": "Today was my birthday and my children decided to take me to the Osaka Japanese restaurant on Sahara. We sat down excited about the fun of celebrating, expecting an entertaining chef. Instead we had to endure watching a chef struggle through preparing our dinner. He was totally unsure of himself and acted very confused. He kept dropping the utensils then bending down to pick them up off the floor, proceeding to wipe  them off with a wet towel...then reusing them. He could only prepare one item at a time and it was so stressful to watch. His knife skills were a d- at best. Not to mention that he brought out two pieces of meat, with one looking fresh and the other looking brown and old.  My daughter asked him about the color of the meat and he said it was fine. Then he offered to cover it in teriyaki sauce to improve the bad smell and taste. My daughter had to excuse herself to the restroom because she felt nauseous knowing it would make her sick if she ate that steak. I then told the very nice waiter what was going on and he explained we were the first people he had prepared a meal for. I said that the chef told us he had been working there twelve years. He said, yes, that was True....but he was working there in other jobs like bussing tables. I could go on about this negative experience but must stop with this final thought...I just do not understand and it is beyond me how they could let an untrained incompetent person play chef at the expense of their unsuspecting customers. Very disappointed!",

He came to the table and seemed quite unsure of himself when he lit the grill the flames were very high and he let it stay lit until it burned away. He was only able to start to cook one thing at once, until he was finishing cooking my lobster. He then added raw chicken to the grill and used the same spatula and knife and than tossed my lobster with it. This was a cross contamination and it was disgusting to watch. We ordered fried rice and he left egg shells in it. He did no special tricks except trying to set the onion on fire, but he even messed that up. He kept dropping the towels and than picking them up to wipe of his spatula and knife. The worst part was when he put the steaks on the grill.  One was bright red and looked fresh the other one was brown. We pointed out the steak being brown he said it was only cut an hour ago. He offered to put teriyaki sauce on it to cover up the mistake. When he put it on my plate it had a bad smell. I refused to eat it. We explained to the waiter who was nice that we were not happy. They still made us pay for all the meals, but took of a small amount for the steak. This was a terrible experience and unfortunately my Mother's birthday and now her memory of her special day is tainted.",

    "text": "All I can say about the sushi here is it's amazing. I told my wife to take me somewhere we have never been for sushi together and she chose Osaka because she remembered loving it 6 years ago. Now here for some information on Osaka.  Exterior: I would consider this a hidden gem that is in plain view. I have passed it easily 20-30 times without ever noticing it. It looks like your average chinese restaurant with small signs and red neon lighting all around the place. Don't let this deceive you.  Interior: As soon as you enter the building you feel like your'e in a different world. I'm not saying it's high class but compared to the exterior it looks good. They have three different areas to sit depending on the experience you would like which I enjoyed. You can have your usual sushi experience next to the sushi bar with a couple small tables for couples, a sushi chef prepare your food directly infront of you while he is doing all kind of tricks and making balls of fire, who doesn't like fire? And lastly they take a more traditional approach which I did and liked, you go to a seperate room with enclosed booth style seating where you remove your shoes and sit on small cushions. Cool experience.  Staff: The staff were great. Everyone acted professionally, gave advice on what rolls were ordered most and preferred by other guests, and the service was on point.  Now for the most important part, sushi: The sushi was absolutely amazing!!! We ordered the \"Titanic boat\" which came with a large variety of sushi on a huge boat. It came with 12 pieces of Nigiri (6 salmon, 3 albacore, and 3 tuna) and they melted in your mouth. The fish was so delicate and well prepared I will definitely be back for more. It also came with 5 other half rolls. I apologize as I can't remember the names of them but can assure you each and every bite was delicious. I have been to numerous sushi restaurants in town, many in California, and have a friend who owns one in south Vegas, and this destroys them all. Sorry for being a traitor if you read this buddy.  I will upload pictures later for all of you to drool at your computers. Enjoy.",

The fish is fresh which is the reason why the rolls are so expensive. They do not have AYCE but the rolls are decent. If you are in the mid for AYCE this is not the place you want to go.   Their service is great! The ambiance is amazing also, the tables are set like traditional Japanese tables where you sit on your knees and eat.

I have been in Vegas for over 20 years, been to this and the Summerlin Osaka several times - however this experience was horrible! First, with how old this place is and how much they charge, update your business! When you walk in, the other review that says this place is like a crack house is very correct! That is the only way to describe the experience when you walk in. Further, nothing has been updated since this place opened ... even the bathroom, with the overflowing dirty toilet!  Now on to the service, very rude and a \"no-it-all\" with zero customer service skills.  We went in because of the sign that said \"Late Night Specials\" - I called and was told many of the rolls were very discounted. The truth is, they are half rolls! AND if you ordered a whole roll off of the main menu, it would have been cheaper then two half rolls. Do you think because it is late night in Vegas, people will eat less, so it is a deal? If you order a half roll from the late night specials, you save an average of $.25. Really? This is your draw to get people in? Very deceptive. The quality of the food was OK, nothing amazing - and not even sure if what we got was what we ordered. Also, do not expect a refill on your water or tea or beer for that matter.   So many better late night places in Vegas that actually wants repeat business.",

We were there on a Thurs. night around 8 and were ushered into the back where the teppan tables are. For one, our table was right next to the kitchen door, which was distracting, and it wasn't busy so we could have been seated elsewhere. The atmosphere was shabby - maybe it was because of where we were seated (other parts of the restaurant looked like they may have been nicer) - not very warm or upkept. It seemed like it had been a while since they decorated. Just.. kind of shabby.   Anyway, we ordered some drinks, then three of the four of us ordered meals from the teppan-dinner menu, and the fourth ordered from the sushi menu. Our drinks came at a decent time, except for one of my friends, who later actually had to remind the waiter about it - turns out the waiter forgot. Speaking of the waiter: he was a very nice man, but he kept butting into our conversations! I think it was his way of giving \"good customer service\" but it got a little awkward after a while, when he kept adding little tidbits and comments to what we were saying.   We actually had some friends that would be joining us later in the evening, but the waiter made sure to tell us that the chef only cooked at the teppan once per table. That's understandable. My friend who ordered from the sushi menu got his food before the tepan chef even came out for our orders, which I thought was a little uncoordinated. Again - it wasn't busy at all. There was only one other teppan table with people and they were on dessert.   Our chef comes out of no where. He's not pushing a cart because the cart has been sitting by our table the entire time, as if they had just left it after the last \"presentation.\" I get that it may be more convenient, but c'mon. It looks bad, and also doesn't imply \"freshness.\" (He did bring the meats and main ingredients out fresh, the cart had the sauces and butter and stuff). So our chef comes out, doesn't introduce himself or anything, just starts cooking. I've been to a teppan-style restaurant before that does this \"presentation,\" but for my friend who hadn't, he didn't even know there was going to be a show! He just thought the guy was cooking in front of us.   Our chef, while nice, was nervous and messed up about every 4-5 tricks that he did. I was kind of embarrassed for him, but I know he did his best. To be honest, though, because of his lack of being personable, it was kind of awkward to sit there and have a conversation while this guy is just doing random tricks at the table. It wasn't engaging enough for us to actually pay attention to him. Osaka didn't deliver on this experience at ALL. The worst part was that this guy's manager (I assume) was watching the whole time, which was even making us uncomfortable.  The food was just okay. Nothing I remember, and honestly, better Japanese food can be found elsewhere for much, much cheaper. After we finished eating, we were hanging around waiting for our other friends to show up, and it took them a long time to clear our plates. The chef came out about a half hour after we finished eating to clean the teppan; didn't say a word again.   Luckily, we had a gift card so we didn't end up paying much after it was applied, because I would have regretted spending anymore than I did. It is way overpriced for what you get (it may have been a different story if we actually got the experience we were hoping for). It is cheaper than Benihana but it is NOT worth the discount. If you want a great teppan-dining experience, splurge and go to Benihana. Everything there is miles better. Don't bother with this place if you're going for that.",

    "text": "When in Vegas recently for a business conference, my sales reps chose this place for dinner after hearing the rave reviews of how Osaka came highly recommended.  I was up for Japanese cuisine and something different from all the flashy tourist places on the strip.  The restaurant is definitely low key, casual and with no glitz whatsoever.  In fact, it looked pretty run down but definitely a favorite and popular place with the locals.  We requested a Japanese table that involved taking off your shoes and sitting down on cushions.  It was pretty run down and when seated and hanging my bare feet down under the table onto the old carpet, I couldn't help but wonder about the numerous pairs of bare feet that touched this very spot prior to me.  Perhaps my 3 stars is due to not being a seafood or fish lover.  I stuck to a teriyaki chicken and steak combo that was dry and just meh.  Rest of my party ordered various fish dishes that were okay but not exceptional.  I also ordered a California maki that came cold and didn't taste freshly made.  The plus, this place was pretty inexpensive verses restaurants on the strip.  It's good to see Osaka has a loyal following and good business.  Service was good too.  Perhaps just a place that wasn't for me.",

    "text": "Came to Osaka really late during my trip out to Vegas to check out the happy hour with some friends, and saw this place had great reviews.  We certainly didn't have a terrible experience, but I can't say I'd come here again.  I got a California Roll, chicken wings and shared a Japanese Burger sushi which was weirdly unique but tasted pretty good.  The California roll tasted odd, I'm not sure if the avocado was in the best shape, but it was alright.  The chicken wings were cool too, and we also shared some edamame.  But the prime reason I'm giving this place 1 star is the price.  This place is ridiculously expensive.  Even a plain 6-piece cucumber roll was $4.  You can get that other places for a buck.  And this was happy hour!   I can get way better sushi for a fraction of cost elsewhere.  No thanks, Osaka.",

You have lots of choices on how to dine. The sushi is good but the choices could be better. I prefer fresh sushi rolls and I think their fresh rolls lack creativity. They have a good selection of tempura and deep fried rolls. The prices are a little much for what they offer and the 1/2 rolls menu is not much of a deal in my opinion. Its a cool place but not my favorite.",

My husband and I have a hard time finding resturants that are as tasty or better than what we can make at home (we are sorta food nerds). We went to Osaka last night for our daughter's 10th birthday and after a little bit of a rocky start (we got confused and couldn't find the entrance to the grill area) we were happily seated and served.  We came because our 10 year old LOVES Hibachi and we had read that Osaka was the original place for sushi in Vegas so we thought...okay lets do it.   1) My husband is not a sushi fan and HE was impressed by the quality of the sushi....so we can go again!!!! Yahoo!   We did three orders of customized sushi as well as a selection of standard nigiri and were impressed by all of them.  1) the fresh halibut recommended by the server...WOW!  2) the Thai Hamachi....WOW!, and 3) the (I think) Firery Roll? (on the top right hand of the custom creations menu) the texture was amazing.  For me the Ikura was a little bit salty and not super firm but when the nigiri was eaten as a whole \"bite\" the sushi rice and wrap balanced that saltiness...I just like to eat egg by egg sometimes...to lengthen the experience. My daughter and Husband orderd the chicken and new york steak Habachi and I got an extra plate (I am more of the sushi eater).  The steak was very very good and very well cooked.  Too many times the meat at hibachi is over cooked.  Not so here, our cook was more of an extermely skilled and social cook than an entertainer and I can say how grateful we are.  The vegetables and meats were beautifully cooked!   I am actually willing to order scallops on the hibachi here...I will try next time....in the past the only times I have had good scallops (meaning not over cooked and leathery) at the Hibachi place was at coastal locales where the seafood was probably purchased from the boat dock down the street.  Judging from the skill of the hibachi chef and the quality of the sushi, I can't wait to try other items on the menu! Also:  they surprised my daughter with a classic ice cream parfait glass with a round of happy birthday at no charge.  So Happy. Then, we got the bill. I was stunned.  SO Reasonable for the quality of the food.  We are giong back.  Happy Tummy",

Never had warm sake my baby popped my cherry on that one and im still on the fence on SAKE!!. She just ordered dessert Tempura ice cream with chocolate syrup in sure its going to be off the hook , cant go wrong with any kind of ice cream. Moderately priced and good fish quality. I recommend the tatami room if your good and fit but if your a big boy like get the regular table ! Since dinner started I've been planning my exit from the table, we will be coming back fo sho.",

    "text": "Came here to try this place on a Wednesday night. We wanted to sit in those booths that you take your shoes off Japanese style. I love this concept. Only thing I would have to say is that the pillows to sit on in this room is kinda old. Some looked new but some were old or dirty. Our servers did an excellent job bringing out everything fast and tending to us. My boyfriend and I ordered the Ron Special Boat. It was filling and good. Didn't care for the potato salad that came with the boat. Everything else was good. The sauce for the tempura was my boyfriends favorite sauce. Before we got our boat we got a refreshing cucumber salad and the miso soup with noodles in it. I love that their soup has noodles in it! It was delicious. The cucumber salad was really good and part of my favorite as well! I also ordered some hot sake. It was smooth and the server did a great job recommending the sake choice for me.  Our Ron special boat had beef, chicken yakitori, came with rice, potato salad, sashimi (salmon, tuna, and I believe yellowtail), California roll, and tempura. It filled the two of us up and we had to get the rest to bring home. Their desserts looked good as well. I think this is a good spot for hibachi and Japanese dining. I think if they updated the pillows then the place would have a better new look and feel to it.",

    "text": "I happened to catch Diners, Drive ins and dives on Food Network the other evening and they featured Osaka Japanese Bistro.  Being new to Vegas, we depend on Yelp for restaurant recommendations.   Naturally, I pulled Osaka on Yelp and the reviews were not bad so my husband and decided to eat here on Sunday.   It was around 1:30 when we pulled up and we were able to find a parking space. Warning, the parking lot is very small.  We opened the door and literally hit a wall.  You can either go right or left to enter the restaurant but there was no sign on why there were 2 different entrances.  Odd but we decided to make a right and enter another set of doors.  You run into a dining room with a sushi bar on the right.  I'm assuming the hostess station is in the middle of the restaurant but not sure.  Just a very strange layout for first timers.   We sat at a table and waited for our waiter.  After 10 minutes, our waiter asked if anyone has taken our drink order which we replied no.  He promptly took our drink order while we viewed the menu.  We took advantage of the lunch menu and their special.  From the lunch menu we ordered: Kamikaze and Tiger rolls in addition to beef yakisoba.  From the daily special menu we ordered the King Crab roll.   The rolls were ok.  On both the Kamikaze and Tiger the sauce was very salty.  Yakisoba was very good.  The beef was really tender.  The king crab roll was nothing special.  Overall. Glad we tried it but will try other sushi restaurants.",

Outside is nothing much to look at but inside is quite authentic and the staff, especially Jared, were fantastic. Thought the prices were very reasonable.   Went with a couple of standards as a baseline and a few of Jared's recommendations. Everything was very good but the special cucumber salad, spicy garlic edamame and roppongi roll were top of the list. Delicious. Wish we had more time so we could go back. Might have to skip something else so we can. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",

The sushi here is also good, but nothing super special in my opinion.  I will come back here for sure. The service is very good.

I should've read the reviews on here before going.  The restaurant is now separated into tatami rooms, teppanyaki, sushi bar etc -- we got the tatami room.... which was fine. We got a sushi platter, zaru soba, selections from their robatayaki menu and agedashi tofu. The zaru soba was actually really good. Robatayaki items weren't bad either -- skimpy portions though. The sushi however, blows! I was so damn disappointed in the poor quality we were given. They used to be fantastic.  After this visit, I really won't be returning again. I like my sushi traditional. I'm kinda a stickler about that. The agedashi tofu was quite dismal too, not True authentic agedashi tofu at all. It was so dismal that the young man refused to eat it and he was the one who ordered it.  The service was attentive though hence the extra star. They have a late night menu with discounted prices after 10pm.",

    "text": "Saw Osaka Japanese Bistro highlighted on a recent Triple D episode and had to try it. We were in Vegas for the weekend and sick of casino food so this was the perfect alternative.   Restaurant atmosphere:  My mom - born and raised in Osaka, Japan - was skeptical as soon as we pulled into the parking lot. She was even more skeptical as we entered the establishment. We were greeted with a black wall! It's drab, a bit dark and the decor is sadly lacking in so many ways...outdated, dingy and not so appealing.   We opted to sit in the tatami room vs. at the tables near the sushi bar. The set-up...taking off of the shoes, tatami mats (I suspect those tatami mats haven't been cleaned in a long time!) GROSS.   If you know anything about the Japanese culture you know that cleanliness is at the top of the list. The second generation owners of this establishment need to take note of this and make an effort to create an atmosphere which is bright, clean and inviting.   Food: Mom ordered the sashimi and tempura combo $22. She said the sashimi was delicious but she was not happy with the rest of her meal. The sunomono cucumbers were crunchy and they're not supposed to be served that way. The rice - plain ol rice - was not cooked thoroughly. RICE - served any way is KEY in any respectable Japanese restaurant!! The miso soup was ok. I ordered the Nebeyaki Udon. The base was good but overall I wasn't impressed.   The rolls are way too overpriced and I just wasn't going to pay $15-$20 for a 'specialty' roll!   Service: our waitress was super nice. I think her name was Haruko. She spoke fluent Japanese which was a plus for my mom. She made suggestions, was attentive and checked in on us several times. There were additional servers that came to check on our dining experience as well and they were very nice as well.   The restroom: F'in disgusting!!! What the heck! You couldn't even wash your hands as there was only a trickle of water! Is this the ONLY restroom in the establishment???!!! Is this where the servers, cooks and SUSHI CHEF washes their hands after they relieve themselves??!!  The hands they will use to prepare and serve your food???!!!! This is a health code violation!   I don't think the average diner is aware of an authentic Japanese dining experience. It definitely isn't at Osaka Japanese Bistro. We were disappointed to say the least.   1 star rating = half for service and half for sashimi!",

The tuna was good..The roll just didn't have anything that stood out.  Osaka Rice - mixture of sushi rice, crab, masago, mayo, sesame oil, and sriracha - Sooooo much yumminess. It's like a comfort food more than anything else. Def try this.  I think it's best to stick with with the fresh sashimi and get some osaka rice to have a good meal.",

We all ordered the shrimp & chicken off the teppan grill menu. The only seasoning I saw them put on the chicken, shrimp, rice & veggies was just salt, pepper and butter. I felt it needed more flavor. Something to set it apart from regular old chicken & shrimp. I feel like Geisha House gives their teppan meals more flavor than salt & pepper. Overall, portion sizes were good like they always should be. You leave full and satisfied. Our chef was awesome and nice. Our waiter was super nice and even chatted with us for a little. He wasn't awkward or antisocial. We had a good dinner.",

And the place has plenty of seating even great for parties or dinner events.  Plus if you go on Groupon you get some kind of discount but I think its only for the anthem location.   Customer service is pretty good. They even gave us a little history about Osaka. How the owner was a great guy. He wanted to help people with no work so he opened a restaurant. There is a painting of him in the sushi bar. Also found out that they are NOT associated with the Lake Mead location.   The food is amazing! I mean your never gonna get it as fresh as Japan but taste is on point. Kinda brings me back to Japan.  It is a little pricey but totally worth it specially  on happy hour! I love love the tempura bam.  The curry is pretty good as well and is a big portion. And of course the sushi! I definitely recommend this place. It doesn't look much considering the location. But its a  MUST TRY!",

We had a reservation for 8 but, with traffic on the east side, we made it around 8:15 and they still sat us right away around the Teppan bar. The young man got us our drinks speedy quick but still gave us time to look at the menu.   I got the Chicken and NY with the Calamari Steak appetizer and a 911(spicy, spicy tuna) roll and half a California. While my girlfriend got the Chicken and Shrimp and Calamari Steak as well. It was about 3 minutes from when he left our table that we had already gotten our soup and salad, delicious.   When our chef came out, he seemed quiet at first but then really started interacting with my girlfriend and I as the night progressed. I won't get too much into his routine because I feel like that's something special everyone should see but it was very cool.   My steak and chicken were perfectly cooked along with the friend rice and the Calamari Steak, tasted very authentic. The Sushi was delicious, not too crazy but not too plain, I loved every bite.   Our tab came out to 112.28 after our $20 tip, not bad considering how much food we got and the amazing service. Came here for our birthday dinner and was fulfilled in every single way. We will come here again with an empty stomach and a big smile :)",

It was 1PM and it wasn't too busy (I think there are 3 occupied tables, a family at tatami, and few people on sushi bar). We were greeted and asked whether we would like to sit on table or tatami. We chose tatami and so directed to back area.   All of the waitresses were very nice and helpful. In fact, when my husband ordered a Ten Zaru Soba (cold noodle) from their regular menu, the waiter informed us that the item also available in Lunch Specials menu and for the same price, we would get tempura (2 pieces of shrimp) on the side. I really appreciate this kind of gesture. Especially because of the last review I read when I stepped out of the car said that this place \"WILL RIP YOU OFF\"!   They also gave out our drinks then miso soups then our food promptly. We tried: - Oh Kamisama (tempura roll with spicy tuna on the top and spicy mayo sauce) ~ very good and fresh - Broiled Eel bento box ~ very good - Tonkatsu bento box ~ 'twas OK - Ten Zaru Soba (cold noodle) ~ pretty good according to husband  Food presentation was really good.  Waitresses keep checking if we were doing OK but in a non-annoying way. They just popped in and out; I think to make sure that we didn't have to go out from our tatami booth to get them.   So yeah, overall, my experience was a very good and enjoyable one.",

Vegas has some great chocked when it comes to this cuisine, some offering outstanding quality while others with great deals and Happy Hours. We came after 10pm to take advantage of the late night menu here, but it was still pretty expensive for rolls. They came out extremely fast however, as if it was cooked in a race. Honestly it was too fast, like we ordered two rolls and less than 5 minutes later we were bested by them. And then our appetizer took a good 20 minutes. So their timing needs to be worked on. They also had hit sake for $5 for late night, but no cold sake which is always very interesting to me. All in all, the sushi was ok, the service was slow to take our order but extremely fast to produce (at least the sushi), and the venue was nicer inside than the area appears. But I would try another great Vegas sushi place instead unless this is simply next on your list.",

From the moment we arrived to the sushi bar, we felt welcome and happy to find a place to seat at the bar. Their vast choice of sushi plus other typical Japanese fair means plenty of options for the whole group. Will definitely come back and recommend to friends and family.",

We came here again today 2017, and I must say, it was absolutely delicious. We got the white tiger, Kai and treasure roll. Blue fin sushi  The fish is ridiculously fresh and extremely tasty, it must be imported from Japan daily  We came here again with our team, and was served by David. He was an amazing host and convinced us to get their rib eye hibachi that arrived in the morning and hasn't been frozen yet.  It was OMG!!!!!!!!!  We all tasted it an no one has ever tried this most amazing steak!  I tried it and I have tasted some of the most expensive steaks in New York, and hands out this was the best steak I have ever tasted in my life.  Keep up the good work! And we will defiantly be back again.",

They do deliver but they don't have a way to order just fried rice. I usually have to order something else then call the restaurant and tell them what I'm really wanting. They also charge me too much for sauces in a 4oz cup. Yet if I ordered same food in restaurant and ate there it would be free. This is why I only gave them 3 stars. The location on Lake Mead IS NOT owned by them. Please don't get the one on Sahara confused. Just look for the small lady liberty statue and you'll know you're there.",

    "text": "I'm pretty sure that the people who gave this place five stars are related to the owners and therefore get better portions and deals. While I can't say the food was bad it was a complete rip off...I paid 100 for two king and queen plates (celebratory dinner for my bfs bday) the plates consist of a lobster tail and filet mignon with grilled veggies.   The lobster was probably considered a midget given the tail size and the lobster meat had been removed and cut up and replaced in the tail where I'm sure we got smaller portions than what was initially in the tail. I mean the amount of lobster was so little I'm pretty sure they took one lobster tail cut it up cooked up and grabbed an empty tail to split it up in two portions.   Similarly when ordering they ask how you want your filet mignon cooked however it is a useless question because they cut it up in little pieces!!! I don't know about you but I don't need help cutting up my meat I'm not a five year old, needless to say the small chunks were all very well done and again it was a very small portion.   You would think that at the very least they wouldn't skimp on the mixed veggies since its not a high cost item but they must be on a small budget because it was not substantial. I guess they get bargain prices on rice because we got a ton of that even though neither of us eat rice.   The food didnt taste bad though and they had nice sauces to dip your minitature meat portions into. At the end we were both left hungry and ended up getting capriottis later that night (bomb sub place that I definitely recommend) and was left feeling robbed especially after getting a better tasting and filling meal for like a quarter of the price.   Definitely not a good place to go unless your super rich and therefore don't mind getting ripped off. That's what I get for trying to avoid the fancy restaurants on the strip to get a good deal.",

Walking in is disconcerting seeing a plain door, then a blank wall to walk around into the actual restaurant. I loved the sunken tables, I loved the traditional aspect of removing your shoes to dine, and the service was superb despite it being a holiday.  The food was great. GREAT. I had an order of pan-fried gyoza, tried the seaweed salad YUM! I ordered a half order of Tekka Maki, half order of a philly roll to play it safe, and tried the 777 roll to be adventurous. I was not disappointed!!! It did take a couple times of my asking to get my beer, but it was absolutely SLAMMED and the poor waitress was attentive but obviously frazzled and very busy.  They get 4 stars instead of 5 because despite us writing down our names and the dollar mount to charge on our split check, I ended up being charged someone's else's tab so my $30 meal is currently costing me $100 in \"pending\" authorizations. An inconvenience, but mistakes happen.",

It's old, outdated and doesn't reflect greatly the quality food. My wife complains of a smell in the resturant. I smell it too, but I think its the tanks gir the live seafood. It wouldnt hurt to vent that smell outside the dining area, it isn't appetizing. Now the mens bathroom is similar to dirty roadside gas stations, that's not cleaned as if your own family/young children were using it daily. That usually steers me right away from any resturant, but the food has been quality & I've watched the sushi chefs like a hawk while seated at the bar in front of them. They are clean & good at their craft. I'd go more often if they'd invest a little to freshen up the whole \"little\" resturant. It wouldn't take much.",

We walked in got seated with no probably, if you ever been to Osaka there are these tatami rooms and there is this one table where you are in a corner and there is a wall where nobody can see you and so unfortunately we got seated there. We sat down and usually you get water within the minute you've been there but no, we didn't cuz we were in the corner. 10 minutes pass by and still no water... nobody has yet acknowledged that we are there. So I stepped out and physically walked to an employee and asked can we please get a waiter and she said yeah yeah of course, so I sat back down and again waited another 10 minutes... so no water or anything. So we decided to just leave and go somewhere else. When we walked out no one even notice that we were leaving, they were too busy talking! & did I tell you that there were no business, there were only 3 tables so they weren't even busy! I'm not gonna say don't come here because I absolutely love this place. Maybe they were just having a rough day.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I never write reviews. Ever. Last night we had reservations for a party of 14 at 8 p.m. our server was very nice. But drinks took 30 minutes. We didn't even see the chef until 9:40. Only 1 chef was on staff. So part of our party was left out of the experience. With his back to them. We finally get to eat around 10 pm. Mid meal the chef comes out with soapy water to start cleaning the grill. We asked if he could wait until we were done eating. He replied with \"but I'm done now\". And continued to clean we asked again that he please wait until we were finished eating, he actually told one of us \"you shut up\". But stopped cleaning.he then said again \"but I'm done it's after closing\" we would have gladly eaten before 10 if it hasn't taken 2 hours to get our food. We then asked for a manager, we were told the manager is off for the holiday. Our server was polite. But it was apparent that staffing was an issue if the manager wasn't even there. It's not fair to your guests to receive this type of service. Nor is it fair to your wait staff who should be able to enjoy their jobs. Another server helped with our checks, so the team work was apparent. But the chef who gave us dirty looks as he stomped off and the lack of management was a huge let down for out party celebrating a birthday. Abd I'm only giving 1 star because it doesn't allow us to leave zero stars. Again, our server was polite, nice and sweet. But he lacked the support that he needed in terns of a chef and a manager.",

    "text": "Mixed feelings about this place.  The building is kinda weird.  You walk in through he sushi bar room to get to the hostess station.  So, if you're sitting in the sushi bar room, which is small, everyone walks by you.  The room had adequate lighting but looked aged.  There is a breeze coming from the vents that would blow for a while and then stop and start and stop.   Appetizers we got gyoza, kalbi sticks, spring rolls.  We did not like any of the appetizers.  Kalbi didn't have any carmelization and lacked the flavor I expect.  Spring rolls where real small and didn't have much filling.  gyoza were small with a thin shell and appeared to be deep fried, so there were crispy all around.  We're used to them being fried on one side and steamed on one side.    We got a roll sampler that had spicy tuna, las vegas roll, cal roll and a shrimp tempura roll.  Rolls were meh, just okay.  Don't think I would order those again.    Then we ordered salmon, yellowtail, and smoked salmon nigiri along with a futomaki roll.  The nigiri was good.  The futomaki roll appeared to have been refrigerated.  Seaweed was a little hard and the rice was cold.    I think if we only got nigiri, this place could have been a 4 star, but with what we got, 2 stars is about all I can give",

We didn't either until there was a bug affixed to my chop stick. Asked for the manager, that was a struggle too...finally got to talk to the owner Gene who informed us the bug must have come from the farm. No sorry, just information of where the bug used to reside. So if you are up for a little excitement in your dining experience, try the salad and ask for extra imported bugs.",

    "text": "They wouldn't give my daughter a place at our table.  My husband, almost 1 year old daughter, and I went to eat dinner at the teppanyaki table.  We got there at about 5:20, without a reservation.  The hostess went to seat someone else and so my husband went to use the restroom.  The manager came over and asked if I'd been helped.  I said no and that there were three of us.  She said she had to wait until we were all here to seat us.  I said my husband was in the restroom.  She refused to seat us until he got done.  This already put a bad taste in our mouths.  Next, they seated us at the short end of the table with my daughter's highchair not at the table as the rest of the table was occupied.  We noted another grill across from us with only 4 people who had just been seated.  We asked our waitress if we could be moved so that my daughter could be at the table with us since she doesn't have the ability to eat in her lap.  The waitress said she'd ask if that was okay.  The manager said no as those spots were reserved.  We said we're going to go ahead and leave since our daughter needs a place to eat and she said \"okay, bye\".   The only redeeming part of the evening was, once the other customers at our table realized the situation, they all moved down and made room for my daughter (even though it meant everyone was squished).  They were so nice we ended up staying and eating our \"just okay\" dinner (it's been a while but we remembered the food as being much better in the past).  The \"people\" who reserved the other seats at the table across from us never showed.    This used to be one of our favorite nights out, pre-baby, however the lack of accommodation means it's not a place we'll go to in the future.",

I placed my order for pick up and as I pulled into the lot a lady was sitting on the curb approached me.   She was someone who probably doesn't get a meal as frequently as most and quietly asked me if I could give her my leftovers after dinner and didn't want any money.   I went into the restaurant to get my soup and half of a sushi roll and asked the server if I could leave money for the lady outside so she could pick her meal and actually be able to sit down and eat it. A bald man who was another server chimed in and was like no you can't do that, she'll bother other customers, that's what they usually do. It's better if you get her something to go.   I will not be returning to Osaka. That man had no humanity or compassion in him. If that's the type of people that work there, my business is not needed. A real sit down meal was all I wanted to provide for someone. Whoever that server was should be ashamed. If you can't help humankind there is no hope.",

I usually order sushi rolls, and maybe their sake sampler or just water. I like their Tatami rooms but the place is older and activity in the surrounding area can feel sketchy. I double check my car and make sure I don't have any items of valuable visible from the outside to tempt some passerby from possibly breaking in. The restaurant itself is borderline dive status but the staff is nice and friendly. Although I did seem to almost get into a debate with one of the servers, one time, over the correct pronunciation of lychee. Whenever I would say, \"lie-chee\" he would respond back saying, \"lee-chee\". I'm sure he pronounces tomatoe as \"toe-mah-toe,\" but I digress.  Never had an issue with the place being super busy. They have a Teppanyaki grill area but I have never tried it so I cannot give an opinion. The food is decent and their prices are more or so on par with many of the other sushi places here in town. Maybe a couple items priced higher than other places I have been to. I am a repeat customer and will stop by again if it's during happy hour and I happen to be in the area.",

    "text": "We visited Osaka on the night before Thanksgiving as a part of our Vegas foodie vacation, based on their feature on Triple D.   Literally the best sushi we've ever had!    I have a weird self-imposed rule about eating fish so far from the ocean.  (Which I know is ridiculous - even living in San Diego, I know most of our seafood is not locally sourced!).  I broke my rule at Osaka, and I'm so very glad I did!  We decided to sit in a traditional Japanese booth, and were seated quickly, and our server was very attentive through our whole dinner.   The portions were generous and very reasonably priced.   Plus they allow you to order half rolls, so you can try lots of different combos!    We ordered the Osaka rice and several rolls...  Absolutely, hands down the Japanese Lasagna roll was one of the best bites of food I've ever had.  Not at all traditional, but so delicious with melted cream cheese on top...  I'll be dreaming about that roll for a while!   We also ordered the Roppongi, Oh Kamisama and Treasure Island at the recommendation of our server.  They were his favorites, and we really enjoyed them.   Then we went a little wild and ordered the Yum Yum, Pocket Aces, Fresh White, And Kai's Special.   We decided that the Fresh White was a little bland, but still better than any of the sushi we've had in California.     Overall, this was an outstanding experience and I'm glad we ventured off strip to try it.   Next time we'll likely sit at the grill, because all of the fish was so fresh and delicious, I have no doubt that the Kobe on the teppan grill is to die for!!",

Last night, we had an early dinner at the sushi bar. (You can also sit at tables in the small front restaurant or dine at the teppan grill in the back, but we always come just for sushi, so we prefer to sit in front of the chefs.) As usual, we ordered a full rainbow roll and a half dragon. And to change it up, we tried two half rolls that we had never ordered before: the fresh white (albacore and hamachi topped with a tangy sauce); and the Treasure Island (salmon, hamachi, and capers--like a Japanese take on a bagel and lox). Both were fine, although the TI was a little tart because it was topped with a thin lemon slice. We much preferred our usual fare; you can't go wrong with fresh fish and eel.  We also split an order of the spicy garlic edamame, upon a friend's suggestion. Meh. And I got a large Sapporo beer. Yum! This feast cost just over $50, and it was pretty tasty. My only issue with the meal was that the rolls weren't rolled tightly enough, so they kept falling apart. Not a game changer, but still ...  Osaka was recently featured on \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,\" so we were expecting it to be full of tourists. Thankfully, it wasn't. Lots of locals, and the same low-key atmosphere that we've grown to expect.  There are several Osakas in town, but this is the best--especially if you're a fan of rainbows and dragons!",

One thing we laughed so hard was that there was a menu saying \"kintama udon\" in Japanese writing. Do you know what that means? \"BALLS UDON\" yes, the balls!! Men's testicles!! LOL I've never heard such thing in my life! I wonder if they knew it when they created their menu. Lol We were laughing so hard that the waiter guy asked us if we are okay lol then we explained about the kintama udon thing and he said \"oh yeah, every Japanese customer laughs\" oh man I died that day.",

I would say the food was average for Teppanyaki. There was nothing fantastic about it. The facility is incredibly small, OLD, and definietly seen better days. I thought the private rooms were probably the best part, however, I did not dine in one.   There was only one bathroom, and it was not exactly clean. The bar was small, drinks were overpriced and the sushi was so-so. Overall it was an average experience, with average food, average service and an expensive price tag. we paid $160.00 for four people. I will not be going again.",

Also a great place for late night sushi. Occasionally they play live music on a piano and it's a very atmosphere. Always suggest this place whenever anyone wants sushi but it's slightly pricey that's the only thing. Its quality and great service which I think is so worth it. Kid friendly but even more enjoyable on a date night.  Enjoy!",

My boyfriend and I went to Osaka to try out their late night menu.   $11 for 6 piece sashimi, $7 for some of their half rolls, $22 for fresh scallop (not part of late night menu). Wanted to get the fresh Uni, but they sold out. Got the wings, Gyu Maki and shrimp shumai as appetizers.  Everything just seemed off. First of all the quality of the fish was not great. Really thin pieces, and almost dry. Got a white tiger roll, it was okay, like the Bonzai sauce, but everything else was just really plain. Fried wings were bland and just looked sad accompanied with raw broccoli and dry carrots.  No music was playing so it got really awkward cuz the sushi chefs were just busy making orders and they didn't even make eye contact with us. If it wasn't for the TV behind the bar we don't know if we would be able sit through our meal.  In the end, we just ate really quick and left. Like I said before, don't know if I would revisit again, maybe if they spruce up the atmosphere a little bit and get better quality of food.",

    "text": "I've been a fan of Osaka for awhile. They've been around for awhile. They're a steady sushi spot. They've thrown in some new items as they've aged. The \"bistro\" part was only recently added, at least to my recollection they were once only known as Osaka. The restaurant, although in a seedy part of town, has been kept up well. I'm sure at some point in time, this spot was a GOOD spot in town. But you can't really help what happens to an aging city. You can help keeping your restaurant clean and nice looking, which Osaka has done.  I enjoy the atmosphere of Osaka, it is dimly lit when you first walk in and around the tepanyaki areas. However, the dining area is well lit with nice, clean, wooden tables. The service has always been up to par when I have visited. The servers are well versed on the menu, they are around consistently to refill drinks (I usually always order a hot green tea).   On my last visit I went with a friend because I had a LivingSocial deal, which they honored without any hesitation. I had a few different items: Age Dashi Tofu. I thought it was pretty good, although I have had a better age dashi tofu at Cafe de Japon. The serving they give at Osaka is quite large. I shared some with my friend. The broth it was in was a teeny bit salty for me, but I did drink it all up. Moving on to sushi, because that's what I came for. I ordered the Lisa Lisa roll (shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, eel sauce). It was decent. Not the best or worst roll I've ever had. The tempura was on the soggy side. Wish it had had a more crispness to it. Next: temaki (hand roll). I always get a hand roll when I eat sushi. I ordered the Miki's special, it's simple: crab, massago, and mayo. It was good. And lastly: nigiri. I ordered the sweet shrimp (Ama Ebi). This was my favorite by far. I wish I had just ordered a bunch of these. They were stuffed full, very generous portions.   My friend also allowed me to try some of the food she got. I unfortunately cannot remember what it was she ordered. But one thing was the Japanese pancake, which I really liked because it had seafood in it.   We ended our meal with the Bomba - chocolate peanut butter! I highly recommend this. It was very good.   Overall I like Osaka. I will be back again. They have a very extensive menu and I would like to try more sushi as well as their Udon.",

Our server was very friendly and hospitable.  The so-so: The food was okay.  I had tempura vegetable Udon soup and a side of vegetable rolls.  The tempura vegetable was good.  The Udon soup and vegetable rolls were okay.  The BF had curry rice.  I tasted the curry, and it was good.  The BF said the chicken was pretty good.  His Sister had Soba noodles.  I'm not a big fan of these noodles, but it she appeared to enjoy it.  I also had a melon soda, which was really good!  It has a marble in the drink, which is entertaining for little kids.  The bad:  The price was a little steep for an average Japanese restaurant.  It came out to $30 a person.  The pitcher of beer also has a large cone in the middle of it so that you don't get as much beer as you think you're getting.  Helpful hint:  They have a point card for those frequent patrons.

The service was just ok.   We maybe seen our server twice. Water drink guy was on it tho. The server said 20% gratuity is added to parties of seven or more. We had five adults and three kids. Just seems rude. We actually planned on a tip with cash this made it awkward.",

That's one reason why I never came here to eat because I was totally under a misconception. In reality it is a beautiful old style Japanese restaurant. They serve high quality food, great drinks from sake to kona brewing company big wave beer. The sushi is fresh! The desert options are bountiful, the rice is cooked well. But most of all the staff is super amazing!!!! Like the best customer service you would ever find! They tend to your every need and make you feel so comfortable! There is a sushi bar area with some tables around that you can sit and dine. Then turn the corner and you are transformed into a whole Japanese feel with their cute tatami rooms. Basically you take your shoes off and kneel at your table or cross your legs. But if your feet start to get numb you can actullay put them down as there is a space for you to sit normal. I went here at 10pm and This place is so family friendly that there were families with their kids. They play soothing relaxing music. It's not loud at all in there. Everything is spaced out well enough to have privacy and not feel crowded. So I went in looking for some good misoyaki fish and they did not disappoint. I'm gonna cut to the chase, I ordered misoyaki chiliean sea bass, a bowl of rice, a bowl of miso soup, two pieces salmon nigir and two pieces of garlic tuna nigiri. I drank hot green tea and for dessert I had the chocolate lava cake with vanilla Ice cream. My bill came out to $44! IT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY and I am most definitely coming back always!!!!! The food is amazing and they have an extensive late night menu which I will try ordering more food from next time. Did I mention the deserts? They have flan here! Can you believe it? They were all out but I will try it next time! The servers were probably the best part! Super wide smiles from ear to ear! Part of the reason why I'm surely coming back! Go try it! Sit in a tatami room! Have some sake! Try the misoyaki sea bass, a bowl of rice and miso soup! You won't regret it!",

We were promptly seated and the waitress served our drinks, she was so nice and gave great ideas for drinks. We had hibachi, I can't remember the chefs name but I know we hat Batman tattoos and a Batman belt, so I'll call him Batman. Let me tell you, Batman made the experience! He was so nice and funny! He engaged everyone at the table (us and a family) he was amazing! The food was beyond delicious and we had such large portions! Seriously if you go, ask for Batman!! We decided this will be our place to go for special date nights! Everyone was friendly and accommodating even with our Groupon!",

It's been many years since my last visit to Osaka Japanese Bistro on Sahara, but on this windy night, I came here with my girl friend in preparation for her upcoming trip to Osaka, Japan, as she wanted to try Okonomi Yaki.    Also we ordered  - Tako Wasabi - Chirashi  - Tokujo Nigiri: 12 pcs of nigiri Chef's choice   My favorite was Tako Wasabi...fresh and crunchy. The Chirashi had so much rice in the bowl, but was also packed with fresh cuts of fish which we enjoyed...unlike the nigiri, that seemed to all be dry and bland.  Service was excellent...they never stop filling our cups with hot tea and water.    Unfortunately for Osaka Japanese Bistro, Vegas has so much competition for sushi lovers, and Osaka stands as just average for me.  -2017 review #30-",

    "text": "We've been coming here for many years-in the 15 years we lived in Las Vegas and 9 years since we've left but returned to visit family. This review is a compilation of all our visits. Osaka is one of our favorite places especially as far as ambiance in LV.   We tend to go to dinner early so there are fewer people and we have the back to ourselves. The sushi bar and bar area gets pretty noisy during happy hour as does the teppanyaki room. So, going early has lots of benefits. We enjoy sitting at the sushi bar on occasion but my favorite is the quiet tatami rooms in the back. The tatami rooms are low tables and seats where you remove your shoes before heading down into a cozy space.   We are such creatures of habit when we do sushi. We always get a hot saki, a Kirin beer, miso soup and shrimp & veggie tempura. Then we change it up-though hubs often has a Chiarashi bowl so he gets lots of different things. They have updated the menu since we started and have a good variety of selections. Osaka does a really good Chiarashi. In fact, I think everything we've had is good.   The past few times we've been there has been with friends for a special occasion and they prefer the teppanyaki tables. We wouldn't go to the teppanyaki table on our own but it's it's nice to do the tables for a special occasion. We usually reserve the whole table and have even had to add a couple seats to fit everyone. They entertain the group though it makes chatting a bit more difficult except to the ones closest to you. We have had steak or shrimp which they cook nicely-despite all the activities on the cook top. The meat come with rice and veggies.  We do recommend Osaka. It is a wonderful place with a variety of areas in one restaurant to have a nice quiet dinner, a fun happy hour or special occasions.",

There's actually a dentist office next door and we usually park there since we've come for dinner when they're closed.",

Our food.... Took over 25 minutes to get soup... Then another 45 minutes to get sushi.... Half of our table got to eat.   The other half had to wait another 30 minutes to get their food.   Saw our waiter again for our bill. Like I said sushi was bomb, but the slow service totally blew it.  For the price we paid, it was not worth it. I definitely will not be back.",

    "text": "Osaka is, hands down, my favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas (and in the last 10 years, we have frequented quite a few). They have excellent fish (top quality, all the time), reasonable prices, and a smaller, quiet sushi bar that is very easy to enjoy a meal at with your family. They also have a dining room with tables, and tatami rooms in the back, where I would personally love to go for a birthday dinner. It's about 10-15 minutes off the strip, and in my opinion totally worth it whether you're a local or in town for vacation.   One of the best bonuses about Osaka is their hours- they are open for lunch and super late (until 2:00 am!!!).   Some ordering recommendations-  - My number one recommendation is simply for the nigiri sushi. I personally have never had a bad experience with their sake or hamachi, and when they say the uni is good, it's really good! I also like their regular-old spicy tuna roll.  - Our family's go-to rolls generally include the O.G. Special (crispy rice with spicy tuna and yummy sauce + sriracha on top) and Kai's Special roll. Both are always hits with visitors too.  - From the kitchen, I personally like the Osaka Rice (sushi rice, masago, crab, sauce). Our family is split between the empura soft shell crab with ponzu sauce and the soft shell katsu with screaming sauce- both are a great appetizer to split.",

Food was cooked as ordered and the servings were plentiful and properly cut to size. Staff was super friendly and very attentive. Glass would go empty and BAM, it would be full. Menu was rather large with plenty of options and to satisfy even the pickiest appetite. Definitely worth visiting and next time we are in town I can guarantee you we will be going back! This reminded me of a small place we frequented weekly in Japan and brought back a lot of great memories with our Japanese friends. Oh and those of you who have been stationed on Okinawa, they have ORION!",

Both him and I love sushi so we had high expectations going in here.  We chose to dine in one of their tatami rooms since we really wanted to experience the authentic Japanese style of dining.  The tatami rooms do provide somewhat a feeling of intimacy and privacy so it was a nice change.  We ordered their sashimi platter (ahi tuna, yellow tail tuna, salmon, albacore), kim chee, miso soup (perfect blend of sweet and salty), a kamikaze roll (eel roll with sweet sauce), spider roll (deep fried soft shell crab roll with sprouts), white tiger (tuna roll flame cooked on top with a white sauce), tuna-poki (our favorite of all dishes, the slices were super thin and fresh, tossed in a light sesame oil dressing with sweet thin slices of seaweed), and a Nigori sake sampler (apple, strawberry, and lychee flavor - our favorite).    We were pleasantly surprised that everything tasted so fresh and all the dishes came out fast.  Prices were not too bad considering we were in Las Vegas.  We spent a total of $130 total for all our dishes including drinks and tip so not bad for a really good sushi joint.  Would definitely love to come back here when we're in town again.",

I have not had sushi this good in a very, very long time.Tough to get fresh fish in Vegas but this place manages to deliver an amazing meal. Enjoyed watching Chef make our rolls. Sadly the reason for the 4 stars: The servers were sloooooow. It took a long time for them to bring our  drinks and refills. Thankfully we sat at the sushi bar so were served our food immediately from Chef. I will go again.",

They brought a large sushi boat, veggie tempura, salad, fried rice, edamame, salad and all the sides stuff like ginger, wasabi, and sauces. They even brought an extra side platter of vegetable sushi for the vegetarians/people with allergies. It was so yummy, gorgeous, and although the sushi lasted pretty much for the duration of the party there were only a few pieces left at the end. Everyone loved it. The price was very reasonable too. I highly recommend them if you want sushi at your party.",

I give one solid star for service (I would give two stars but this only goes up to five and I need the other stars for the rest).  Our waiter was on top of it, full of humor and personality, and when we were too full to order dessert, he still brought us out a triad of ice cream to share with spoons and a candle as a birthday treat for my partner.   One star for the atmosphere.  The music isn't too loud, there are tatami rooms with ample room, and the decor is very simple and late traditional.  One star for the price and portion sizes.  We were very happy with the lunch prices, the bento box had plenty of food (I couldn't finish my rice), and there is Asahi on draft, which I highly recommend over the bottled.  Two stars for the food and the fact that I will most definitely be coming back!  We got both types of oyster appetizers that are raw, and it was a tie for which tasted best between the four of us.  But all were delicious.  I had the grilled saba in my bento.  The portion looked small and not like much, but the flavor and texture were a wonderful delight and I did not encounter a single bone, which never happens with saba!  The tempura was lightly battered and the vegetables were fitting (sweet potato and carrot, etc).  Everyone loved the house made salad dressing.  It was light and refreshing, as was the seaweed salad I had with my bento.  I ordered tonkatsu for my partner and it was of a great texture and not too thick, or too thin and dry.  It was very light in texture and fried to a perfect golden brown throughout.  The soup appetizer was not miso, but more a teppanyaki restaurant soup more predominant with broth, but was surprising to have a small amount of noodles in it, which we were all pleased with.   Osaka, thank you very much for a wonderful time while my family was here on my partner's birthday!!!  ^_^",

It use to be where I took dates. The sushi is decent and what I enjoyed the most was the atmosphere. If you buy an Osaka shirt, every visit gets you a bottle of saki. I am a huge sushi lover and fancy sushi has become pretty typical. Every time I have been there and sat at the bar they offer a complimentary bottle of saki. Nice! Just a nice place to go.",

We sat at a tatami room for just him and I, it is a traditional japanese room were you have to remove your shoes and sit on your knees. It was so comfortable though and we felt like we was the only ones here because the rice screens separates all the tables and it feels more like a private dinner. I loved it! Oh and right when you walk in you are greeted from every person you pass by who works there. Our waitress was so nice and have a sense of humor. In the menu there was just so much to chose from. We were soo full but my fiance still wanted to try the desert which was the fried tempura ice cream. Damn I was good to go after that. It was like a orgasm in your mouth haha. Well I would definately go here again but only on special occassions.",

Their service and food is pretty consistent, but the reason I'm upgrading their score is because of the servers. They are always very courteous and come by to refill drinks at least twice each time i visit. They even have tolerance for the lurkers... you know, those people who stay at the restaurant way past the time necessary after eating there. (I, unfortunately, know this from personal experience... thank you for not kicking us out!). So a shout out to the workers at osaka!",

    "text": "This was my favorite restaurant in 1999. The Japanese Sushi chefs were engaging, talented and very hospitable. In a dearth of culture and social connection, these guys made me feel like a king. Twelve years later? It was comforting to see the same art and decor. But when I entered and was ignored and left without a sign telling me to wait or move forward to one of the other rooms, it was uncomfortable. Three chefs ignored me, the waitress walked by and looked at me, no acknowledgement, and continued serving others. What happened to this place? You have a Las Vegas icon, once upon a time it was Caesars or Osaka, now everyone loves Sushi (thank you everyone, I can get plenty of good sushi everywhere, thanks to you) and Osaka is not worth passing the next Sushi place to get to. It's expense account expensive with average service and average food. The ankimo was fishy, the chu-toro was stringy and no better than the hamachi (wouldn't it be better to say you were out rather than dress up a fatty hamachi or blue-fin?). One saving grace, in a world of competitive all you can eaters downing monster portions of nigiri and sashimi, the portions of nigiri were small and mouth sized, beautiful. Sushi is a delicate food served with style and grace, thank you for the small portions. But then the cut roll menu looks like Denny's with the \"me-too\" monster portions and americanized flavor. Help!",

The sushi is consistently fresh, although it might not be the best cut like those I've had in Orange County. But if you're into tempura, this is the best place to go; it beats Frenzy Sushi in OC's tempura rolls.  The chef here are creative and they consistently create rolls that incorporate the East and West ingredients to provide customers with one of a kind experience.  If you like to try as many different roll as possible,go for it and get half roll instead of full roll, and trust me it's worth it. The tempura rolls are party-in-your-mouth good. I think it's great place to try to bring your love ones who are a little iffy about trying raw fish.  They won't notice because of the freshness of the fish and also the tasty sauce that come with it.  Other than the roll, their nigiri and sashimi are alright.  The uni is another good one to try, very fresh and buttery.  I got my sister to try it, and she's not a big sushi fan.",

Why i love the place: -Eat the volcano roll. it's the most delicious food item I've even tasted in my life. - the rolls all come in half or whole, so you can order lots of different rolls and share. - the place is affordable. -The flat screen tvs at each booth have a looping slide show of everything that they sell in the place. if your conversation falls off, you can drool at the tvs.",

And it's not one of those Asian fusion restaurants on the Strip, so that adds to its appeal.    If you're in the mood for Japanese, try this place.  Plus they have combo dinners and soups that would appeal to the non-raw fish eaters too.",

They have Teppan table but I always prefer the sitting at the tatami room, cause it's so cozy and private if you want to bring your partner.  Service is wonderful, and food came out fast.  For desert, I recommend the green tea mousse, they have the most prefect taste, not too sweet and not too creamy.",

Nothing to gripe or write home about.    The food:  forgettable.  The Korean style chicken was utter crap.  Stir-fried and all you could taste was spice.  Hello?  Korean chicken is supposed to be deep-fried.    I also ordered the udon off the late-night menu.  The broth had completely no taste whatsover.  They could have used minimal effort to load it with salt and MSG and that would have been a huge improvement, though not very imaginitive.    The gyoza was ok but obviously store-bought.    Would I go again?  No, I would rather go to Albertsons' and buy a microwave dinner.",

As you open the door you're greeted by a wall and a slightly off putting smell. Still I'm here and hungry, we're doing this! We were seated in the traditional Japanese table and our waiter was friendly. We ordered the yellowtail collar, miso sea bass, sashimi plate, and I LOT of salmon nigiri. Our waiter offered to upgrade the the salmon to \"butter salmon\" for .95 an order more, and yes I want the best RAW fish so we upgraded. Water and tea were refilled promptly and endlessly but our waiter kinda disappeared and left us hanging on who to order more food with. I wish he had just given us a quick heads up, especially since we had hungry kids wanting more of that salmon. All told it was an ok experience. The lack of stars attributed to the fact that if I have to upgrade my salmon you should get rid of the lower quality salmon and serve the best as a sushi place should. Also, the bathroom really smelled, like into the hallway sewage smell. This place has been around since 1967 and is in need of some upgrades. I'll be looking for a better fit for my next sushi dinner out.",

The 12 piece chef's choice nigiri was a great value at $35, with excellent amaebi, uni, toro etc.  Well over $35 worth of sushi and every piece was great quality.  Even the beef teriyaki that my 7 year old nephew had received excellent reviews from everyone at the table due to the quality of the meat.    The service of the staff lived up to the quality of the food as well. If you're visiting the strip and want some great Japanese food, avoid the crowds and head a couple miles west on Sahara to Osaka.  I'll be going every time I'm in town.",

Since they have limited tables, we ended up dining in one of the tatami rooms.  The sushi and nigiri was fine but not outstanding. Had the salad with seared tuna.  Not too bad but I have had better.   Prices were reasonable for the dishes but portions were on the small side.  Service was adequate though the waiter forgot to bring the miso soup that came with the lunch and we had to remind him at the end of the meal.   Probably not on my list to revisit on our next trip to Vegas since there are many other sushi restaurants to explore.",

This is the first time my husband and I have gotten a boat because we finally went with friends instead of just the 2 of us. We got the titanic and it was awesome! I'm not a big sashimi fan so the others enjoyed that but I loved the rolls. The 911 was my favorite because of the spice but the lasagna roll was really yummy too. I was surprised at the warm gooeyness and all the flavors melted together perfectly. I also think it's awesome that they offer half roll options for many of their items so you can try a  larger variety. I also tried sho chu for the first time, which is like a sweet potato vodka, and it was smooth and delicious. My friends got a bottle of Nigori Matca, which they graciously shared with me, and it was amazing! I could drink that all day!",

    "text": "Now that Yelp is offering delivery from so many excellent restaurants, there really should be an option to mark the review \"in-house, \"take out,\" or \"delivery.\"   I've eaten at Osaka once before, in-house, for a birthday treat. It was before Yelp, but I would have posted a very favorable review for it back then. My only criticism would have been that they didn't serve pickles with the rice.  This review is for their delivery service through Yelp.  I recently reviewed another sushi establishment based on a delivery order. I was disappointed then; this experience was so much better!  The sushi we ordered was prepared beautiful, generous but not overly big slivers of fresh, sweet fish on expertly prepared rice. And the presentation, for delivery food, was excellent. They even included that plastic \"grass,\" which is annoying, but at least is says \"we tried!\" All the boxes were labeled with the menu item they included, a really nice touch! And the order was correct; a blessing. We asked for extra chopsticks and wasabi, and they sent us service for eight, with enough wasabi and ginger to keep our nasal passages clean for a month!  We ordered tempura as well, and that's where this establishment lost its fifth star. The tempura was a bit heavy and oily. The dense oily texture was due in part, I'm sure, to \"delivery time lapse,\" because tempura is meant to be eaten hot out of the oil. Even a few minutes left sitting will cause it become oily. And reheating is problematic, as the shrimp will be over cooked and the veggies limp. So even though it's really no one's fault but mine (for ordering it), I still had to pull that last star.   This place is not cheap. You can balance the price with the quality though, and order judiciously. And certainly, a couple of rolls and a side would be a better value, but I prefer traditionally prepared nigiri, so we ordered no rolls.  We'll be returning to the restaurant later this month for my birthday; a Living Social deal so very budget friendly. And I can heartily recommend this restaurant for its delivery service! Well, except the tempura, but if you order fried food for delivery, it's your fault!",

I also tried the OG special which was similar to crispy spicy tuna appetizer. The only negative thing is the parking. It's real small and if the place gets busy you may have to park in the parking lot next to business. There is a server there named Jared that helped us and he was great. Very attentive and nice.

    "text": "A staple of mine while I was going to school down the street, I am almost obligated to write a review for this fine establishment. A sushi joint that has yet to let me down.   Osaka serves all of their items a la carte, so no AYCE. But if you have the extra money and want better quality sushi than what you would get from a AYCE place, come here.  Anytime of day is a good time to come, they have lunch and late night specials. The rolls and nigiri are always fresh and delicious, and I regularly order their various bento boxes, combo meals, and appetizers. I am more of a nigiri guy, but this place has plenty of appetizing and unique rolls that I will often order. As I stated earlier, this place has yet to let me down, I have ordered a lot of different items off the menu, and they are always on point.  The service is always top notch. The wait staff is always attentive, and will always customize your order to your liking. I've never gotten a wrong order, food that took forever to come out, or items missing. If you decide to eat at the bar, the sushi chefs are awesome, and will always start up conversation to be friendly and to see what you would want to order and make suggestions. One of my go to chefs is Oscar. He is normally there during the lunch hours, and always makes awesome rolls. He even does his own custom order of baked mussels with Sriracha sauce that is awesome, ask for it, and he will be happy to make it for you.  While not necessarily a con, it can be pricey to get your fill here  if you just plan on eating sushi. But it comes with better quality of food, so it almost cancels itself out. They at least have a reward card here to accumulate some free food after a couple of visits.  It is one of the older sushi spots in Vegas for a reason. Top quality food with awesome service is always a good combo when eating out somewhere.",

Here's the bad: terribly slow service. It took over 30mins to make a simple roll. Luckily we dined with friends so we weren't in a hurry but we hardly saw our waitress. I shouldn't have to flag people down just to find out the status of an order. When she did finally return, she gave us our check. She never came back. Had to go to the counter to pay which is no big deal but I waited for 20mins just to pay. Staff just walked by me and several people waiting to pay, not even acknowledging anyone.  I won't return. There is a huge selection of sushi places I would rather go to.",

Anywho, I love the history of Osaka in Vegas. But honestly, that's where my strong feelings end. Everything else is just kind of meh for me.   I came here with my fiance's family for lunch and I got the lunch ramen meal. It came with tonkatsu ramen, a salad, a sushi roll, and two gyozas. The salad I got was so wilted it was rotten in spots. The sushi roll was spicy crab, but it wasn't spicy. The gyoza was yummy. But the ramen was under-seasoned and sadly, quite bland.   Overall I had two gyoza, on piece of the roll, and a taste of ramen for lunch. Kind of a bummer.",

They have a huge selection of traditional Japanese food and sushi tools.  They even have half tools if you aren't sure if you are going like it.  They have a nice alcohol selection that includes a huge sake menu.  The atmosphere is a bit dark inside.  There aren't many windows that I've noticed.  You have a choice to site on cushions or a chair.  The prices are reasonable if you don't order steak dishes.  I have gone several times and really like it.  It's in an older part of Las Vegas closer to the strip.  I highly recommend giving them a try!",

I think it's Drives, Dines and something.   I ordered Udon and my father order the Shrimp Tempura dinner. The soup wasn't my favorite, nothing wrong with the soup, I just think that type of soup is not for me. I starting to see that I don't like Asian Soups. I did like the Shrimp Tempura though. I should have ordered that.   My server was a so nice and the service was very good. Everyone that worked at the restaurant was very kind.   The only complaint that I have about this place is the part of the restaurant we were sitting in, the booth area, it didn't smell the cleanest. We had to take off our shoes and sit on a cushion at a table that was low to the ground, like traditional Japanese tables but it had an opening for our feet to touch the ground. It kind of smelt like feet. I thought maybe I was hallucinating but I asked my dad if he smelt it too and he said yes. So that's my only complaint.   Everything else was fine and it was cool trying traditional Japanese Food while visiting Las Vegas.",

Decent size portion and nice quality. Picture of my bento box enclosed.  Restaurant seems small when you walk in, with few tables and sushi bar.  But afterwards wandered around and lots of space in the back. Sat at the sushi bar and was talking with one of the locals and he enjoys this place.  Always a good sign.  In fact, a local recommended  Osaka to me.  Service was friendly and efficient.   No wifi, server said it was for internal use only.  Not fancy.  The area is sketchy and parked short distance away for semi adventurous walk.  Keep your eyes open as easy to miss.   If they moved to the strip,  it would be double in price. Will repeat.",

We had sushi, Teppan scallops, cold soba noodles, shiitake and chicken skewers and katsu soft shell crab. The chicken thigh skewer was our least favorite. It was sorta bland. But Everything else was delicious! The sushi was fresh and there were lots of options to choose from. Did I mention that they have the option of traditional Japanese seating?

We made reservations and made our way there. Located in a standalone building in a strip mall, we arrived prepared to enjoy what they had to offer . . We lucked up as we had the restaurant to ourselves which meant the staff catered to our every move and want. We opted for sitting at the sushi counter. Perfect for watching the chef prepare our food . . We came during lunchtime so we had a small salad to start and a miso soup. Next we ordered a classic favorite yellowtail and scallion with a side of edamame . . We finished with the Tiger roll. I love a good sushi roll that has balance. I'm not a huge fan of spicy roll but if it has more than one fish and only one has a little bit of spice then I can handle it as it's not overpowering the entire roll . .  If your in or near Henderson, NV be sure to check them out. They also have a hibachi section and tons of other options which I'm sure is just as good!",

Arrived quickly and I was disappointed with beef and chicken only because there was a very light taste of the sauce....both were good but should have had more sauce, the Katsu had a lot of sauce on the side....delicious, order that instead of the other 2 unless you are starving like I was.   I will return, great food, service and smiles by all the staff.......10 minutes from Strip Hotels....GO!",

I can't sit with time or hardwood under my legs without a lot of pain and I felt so good after my meal.  The food! The gyoza is the BEST ive ever had. The udon was so tasty. You can get any standard sushi roll deep fried! I had a deep fried California roll and it was yummy. The shrimp fried rice and teriyaki chicken were both terrific.  I cannot wait to eat here again soon! Also, very reasonable prices.",

    "text": "Quick Review: Great value in the late night menu, good, but expensive food at other times of the day.  Long-Winded Review: When I grew up in Vegas in the 80's, there were only 1-2 Japanese restaurants in town, but they were very authentic ones that served food you could find in Tokyo.  Fast forward 20 years and we have a Sushi restaurant on every corner.  Teriyaki Chicken is served at Jack in the Box.  You can get California Rolls at 7-11.  There are hundreds of \"Japanese\" restaurants out now, but they're as close to Japanese as Olive Garden is Italian.  Osaka's menu remains largely grounded in its Japanese roots, but it also features a good selection of \"custom\" sushi rolls that you'll find in other sushi restaurants.  The menu is extensive, and some parts may be difficult to navigate since it is in Japanese (or the English equivalent, Romaji).  Item descriptions are all too brief and unless you've been there before, you may be intimidated by ordering something new.  It's probably best to ask your server or sushi chef questions before ordering.  What troubles me about Osaka is that I feel it's trying to be all things to all people.  It serves authentic Japanese fare, but it's also trying to be edgy, trendy, and hip by offering experimental fusion dishes and desserts.  However, the fact that I still go there regularly suggests that Osaka's experimentation doesn't bother me all that much.  As with older Japanese restaurants, prices are a tad higher than other places in town ($15 for chicken teriyaki dinner vs. $9.95 at other places), but the quality is much better.  You're not going to get as much food, but if you're looking for quantity, I can suggest some good all-you-can-eat sushi places that will feed you for under $30.  The real value of Osaka is its late night menu (10 pm - 2 am).  It features a wide variety of food for under $10.  You can get rolls and appetizers for $5 or less, and entrees are available for under $10.  The Japanese Style Beef Bowl is a steal at $5.80 (it's like a Yoshinoya Beef Bowl, but tastier).  It's a great place to go with friends after/before clubbing since you can do a family-style meal.  Desserts are hit or miss.  The Tempura Ice Cream is a great value at $5.50 and it easily serves 2-4 people.  Some of the other items are good, but definitely not worth the high price.",

There is a room for table seating, a room for sitting with the chef as he prepares your meals and a room for good ole Japanese style seating. You remove your shoes and you sit on a pad and down low. We sat here. It was awesome. The initial server that serves you water and drinks and busses your table was a mid-aged white man who spoke very well (very educated) and it was a dismal reality check as to the stake of our economy that this professional has been reduced to busser work. Not that we don't love or need our bussers, they definitely keep the restaurant in order. I couldn't refuse the sushi. I ordered a half roll of the Asakusa (Spicy Tuna Roll topped with Albacore & Scallions) which was close to orgasmic. I ordered a standard yellowtail roll and then I checked out the rest of the entrees and found a Curry Tempura (which does not seem to be on their online menu). It was FANtastic!! Needless to say I left with happy taste buds and a loaded stomach. If I go back to Vegas I will most certainly be visiting here again.",

It has a unique feeling - a feeling you wouldn't normally get in a Las Vegas restuarant.  We were sat and I asked if we could possibly do the Hibachi. I figured my two year old might like it! Unfortunatly, they told us that this was not available and that reservations should be made for this. They placed us in this cozy section of the restauant (non hibachi) where we could order off of the menu. We ordered chicken and beef tariyaki and some veggie tempura. Food was good, not too overpriced. The wait staff was very polite and even brought out extra orange slices for my daughter.   If you looking for an inexpensive restaurant with a fun atmosphere, check it out! I would go back. It wasn't too overpriced, and anyone who treats my daughter to a toy from the toy box on their way out is a fan of mine!",

    "text": "Osaka is easily one of the most civilized sushi restaurants in Vegas, and it's my \"default\" sushi spot.  I have come to thoroughly dislike the multitude of \"fusion\" sushi joints cropping up all over town. The majority of them are owned by Koreans and have little in common with traditional Japanese food.  Thankfully, Osaka is an oasis here in the Mojave desert. Having been around for more than 40 years, they were doing traditional sushi long before it has hip or trendy. And they've stuck with a traditional approach, relying on top-quality ingredients and skilled chefs.  The owner told me he gets his fish from the same supplier as Nobu and they often split a fish between the two restaurants. To the sushi snob, the difference is apparent.   As wonderful as the food is, the dining experience is what really sets Osaka apart. From the coziness of the sushi bar to the tranquility of the tatami rooms, Osaka offers the most civilized dining experience I've encountered so far. No blaring hip hop, no trendy decor, no pushy servers, just an hour or two of peace and tranquility to enjoy good quality food. It's like Zen meditation with raw fish. Divine.",

Tonight the waitress was awful, just rude.  And her behavior progressed as we explained to her how disappointed we where that she never brought us bowls for our sauces so that we could dip our sushi, my tuna stuffed jalapeno poppers took forever to bring out and that is one of the easiest items to prepare on the menu and the fastest!!!  One of my friends went up to the front and got her own bowl and the hostess brought us more water because our waitress just disappeard.  After we complained she asked if we would like a free dessert and we accepted that, but she rolled her eyes at her after we asked her if she was new.  Her english could have been better too, this is a Japanese restaurant, why would you hire an hispanic waitress whose english is mediocre????  We will not be coming back there, EVER!!

Tasty sushi, hit or miss on maguro sashimi.  The edamame portion has recently been shaved to a small handful of pods, at $2.95, now that's a rip off.  I had to work on Valentines, which by the way is a WAY overrated day, non the less the BF and I had a late night meal. He had the tonkatsu which he said was fabulous. I had sashimi and one roll. Like I said, not bad for late night dining, 1 in the morning. BTW, they close at 2",

All the sushi was delicious, try the sushi lasagna (omg, to die for!).  The teppan grill was great.  We had steak and salmon but first they served us soup and rice.  The soup was really yummy and I loved the little noodles, very yummy.  The fried rice was great (and cute pacman while they make it for the kids), and the meat and veges were so fresh.  The entire meal was just a pleasure.  The staff was so attentive.  They have a cool ordering system - they don't even have to go to the kitchen to place the order.  They just put it into their little handheld and the kitchen starts making your food.  The sushi came out so fast, we were hungry!  Can't wait to go back!  We were so full we only had room for a scoop of green tea ice cream.  The dessert menu looks amazing and I love all the pictures.",

I have been coming to this specific location for 7 years now and this place will always be my favorite for the best quality sushi. I recommend trying this place out whether you enjoy raw fish or not...The service is wonderful and the staff is always friendly. Osaka has never let me down. The only problem i see personally is that it is not that spacious and the sushi bar is a bit crowded. Other than needing to expand their restaurant, everything is pretty amazing. Sushi love!!",

    "text": "The restaurant looked nice with exception to the brown water stain around the air conditioning intake vent. It was quiet inside with the exception that the front door we sat by slammed hard and squeaked continually due to lack of repair. The shabu-shabu was extremely sweet in comparison to more authentic cuisine. It tasted almost like candy, which leads me to believe it is over-Americanized. The gas burner we were using had trouble getting re-lit. When we turned it low, it would go out and we would have to manually re-light it. For as expensive as this restaurant was, they should be using stainless steel or ceramic chopsticks. This became most apparent when a member of my party wound up with a 1/8\" splinter in her finger, from the cheap wooden disposable chopsticks.   At this point, the only redeeming quality we found to this restaurant was our waiter. Our waiter, Jared, proved himself to be one of the best waiters in the world. Despite, being incredibly stretched thin between two rooms, he was on top of all of our needs and wound up loaning us a lighter to re-light the defective burner. He was not only kind and courteous, but in the extreme emergency of needing tweezers to remove the splinter, he was able to retrieve a pair from the emergency first aid kit that he carries in his car; because no one else in the entire restaurant had any tweezers or way to help us. We didn't waste any time tipping him EXTREMELY well.",

Tuna poke salad ($8) was tasty, shrimp shumai ($5) was okay but didn't hit that craving-dim-sum spot that I hoped it would. Sushi was surprisingly good- fish was fresh, flavors were on point. BF and I were torn between picking favorites among the rolls: his was the WHITE TIGER (shrimp, takuan, avocado, cucumber, topped with lightly seared super white tuna, soy sauce, bansai sauce) while mine was the KAI'S SPECIL (eel, spicy tuna, avocado, cream cheese, eel sauce). The Cali roll was as expected, and the OH KAMISAMA was good too (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, topped with seared salmon, tataki, banzai sauce).   Service was attentive up until our bill came- then our guy disappeared for a solid ten minutes for no apparent reason. We were the only patrons present in that part of the restaurant.",

The waiter came around and could tell he hadn't touched it and asked if something was wrong. He said yeah I just really didn't know it was raw and the waiter laughed and said no problem I will take it off the bill. First off it was my friends fault and I am not used to Asian people who work at restaurants having good customer service.  My usual order here is the miso cod and the cucumber salad with crab. Both dishes are executed well. The miso cod is both tender and flakey and the crab salad has a refreshing flavor that pairs well with the miso cod.",

    "text": "Very American style sushi, not what I was expecting. I like the taste of raw fish and don't appreciate nigiri coming from the chef with so much wasabi the fish can't be tasted, especially if that is the experience on the majority of the pieces. Rolls aren't much better, the Aces and Yum Yum were  bland, and in the case of the Aces over powered by sauces. Total price was $90 for two (Friday 6/20/14). If you like Wasabi more than fish, and prefer McDonald's to In&out this place might be for you,  but if you'd like even a hint of tradition or subtle flavors look elsewhere.",

My husband introduced me to this place 6 years ago and we have been coming here ever since. Everything on their menu are so delicious and the price is great too. We always take our family and friends here whenever we are in the city or when I come here for business trip. Never miss a dinner here when we are staying at the strip. The staff here are so friendly and awesome. Rudy has been serving us ever since my husband took me here. And he is still here at the restaurant. We come here not just for some great and delicious sushi and tempura crab legs but to visit our friend Rudy too. Love this place!!!",

    "text": "Osaka's a Las Vegas classic.  It's been around since before it was fashionable to do this whole sushi thing.    Housed in an older building and older section of the city, the restaurant ambles backward in odd angles, but it provides for different seating areas.  Up front is the sushi bar and traditional table seating, in the middle are Teppan grills, and in the rear are Tatami rooms.   Everything at Osaka is always delicious.  The fish is always fresh and looks appetizing.  I had some of the best tempura of my life here.  The chefs are very accommodating with special requests.  Once I attended a birthday party here with at least 20 - 25 people in attendance, all of whom were coming and going at different times, and the service was great.  Everything was prepared correctly and everyone's separated bills were correct as well.  It might not have the pomp and circumstance that other newer sushi bistros do, but Osaka is a safe bet for delicious, fresh food in a comfortable environment with superb service.",

We ordered, I had the OG Special and my husband ordered chicken fried rice, we also had steamed gyoza. The gyoza was awesome, and the fried rice was really good. We like a little more egg in our fried rice than most so it was perfect for us. My roll was interesting. The rice is crispy like it was grilled or something, which I wasn't expecting because I didn't completely read the description. It was really good, you just have to get passed the square shape, heated, crispyness. As we were getting our food a large party showed up and they got all of the attention. We ran out of water and waited over 20 minutes for a server to bring us our check so we could leave. We would have asked sooner if we had seen them but they were lost in the back with the huge party. Very unfortunate for a place with such outstanding reviews.",

At any rate, if you love sushi, check out Osaka.  They're not the cheapest place in town, but it's still better than the strip.  This is no AYCE hack joint; but you can order half-rolls and go to town with the variety - they also have a decent happy hour/late night menu.    My favorites are the Oh Kamis",

    "text": "Another nightmare of a restaurant, perfect for those that think that a California Roll (poorly made) is the height of Japanese cuisine.  Rumor is that Yukio Mishima ate here before deciding to kill himself.  1. Ambience: When you first walk in, you think \"hey, instead of the pretentious bs overpriced Vegas Hotel Japanese restaurant scene, I may have found one of those amazing hole-in-the-wall spots that will be a great authentic experience\"...well, the hole-in-the-wall is right, and in this case, it is just that.   The restaurant is old, dilapidated, and damn confusing to escape from. But if you check it out thoroughly, you can almost smell (um and smell other things to) that this was once a great, great place. It looks like the shell of a restaurant taken over by someone's kid or run by an owner who no longer cares whether he has a customer or not. Perhaps his dog died and he's depressed. Perhaps the dog is one of the menu items.   In fact, when we were there, there were about 4 people in a space that could seat at least 100 or more I would think.  Then there are the prostitutes and what not that like to stop by for their pick up orders. Not the restaurant's fault but certainly, this is an inviting atmosphere for them. Funny part is that they got better service then we did.  2. Service: haahaha! What? What's service? Um. Not on the menu.  Yah, so we sat in front of the most disinterested Japanese sushi chef I have ever experienced outside of wacko Nozawa in LA. But Nozawa is at least an actor. This momo was for real. Rude attitude. Totally didn't give a shit that we were the only customers at the bar, or basically in the restaurant. He was busy in his own world. And then of course, there is the attitude driven little Yakuza wanabee waitress who looks like she needs to focus more on the Hello Kitty art on her nails, then bother with a customer.  When we asked in advance if a certain item was cooked a certain way, and were given incorrect information, they still hesitated, and gave us attitude about taking it back! I mean, we asked in advance! But its our fault that they deep fry what in any normal restaurant is grilled. Oh I speak of YAKITORI. Yes. They deep fry it here so that it has a wonderful brick like consistency. Yum. I guess they didn't read the definition of yakitori, like the part about the \"grilling\" aspect.  Oh, and when we said our \"itadakimasu\" and upon any \"thank you\" to the chef...pin drop...no response. Oh man, he looked annoyed and pissed the entire excruciating meal! Wanted to get my tanto blade from the car and go Watari Tetsuya on his ass but I was more in a Totoro mood. Or maybe Golgo 13. Yes I speak Otaku.  On top of that, no one comes by to see if we need anything. Have to call out for the waitress for water, a plate, a gun, whatever.  3. Food.  This is simple. Gross. Lousy quality fish. Even the salmon was 12th grade. And that is cheap fish to do right. And don't think you can escape into Rolls and Handrolls. You can't. Because they are as bad as everything else. Drenched in sauce to make up for the disgusting taste.  All together...125 dollars and no \"thank you\" from the retards that run this place. Not impressed is an understatement.   I challenge you to try OSAKA and experience the disaster that spots like Nobu made possible. So now you have two choices in Vegas. Authentic -Fake Disgusting Overpriced and Authentic-Fake OK Overpriced. Either way, there is no Japanese food other than Ichiza and Raku in Vegas. Actually, there is no Japanese food in Vegas. Cause those two options are like McDonalds in Tokyo.   Instead, find a hot Japanese girl or guy, get your Tanto blade, and threaten them to make you a proper dinner. Make sure to check your salmon for parasites, and in the case of Osaka, the chef as well.  P.S. I feel like I may have gone a little over-board in this review and so I apologize to anyone who's feelings I may have hurt, like the a-hole chef who stole 125 dollars out from our wallets and in return gave us horrible service and food.",

Now that I think of it, I think this location is the only location with a happy hour menu....  Anyway, my thoughts on the food here can be found on my review of their Anthem location. I will say, their service here is hit or miss and is inconsistent, which I find irritating sometimes.  Kampai to Osaka's top notch menu and cuisine! :)",

    "text": "My cousin loves this place. We were actually seated at Steak N Shake and we had this epiphany that we should go get sushi instead. So we got up and drove all the way up the I-15 to Osaka.  When you enter, you're greeted by a blank wall. What is this - a Japanese Speakeasy? You then turn right and go through another door that takes you to a small sushi bar area. From this initial view, you'd think the place was tiny. If you continue to the back and left, though, you discover that the place can seat quite a lot of people. They have a Teppanyaki area and a surprising number of private booths and traditional looking Japanese sunken dining tables. The space is very aesthetically pleasing.  Unfortunately, when it came to the food, I was disappointed. I really wasn't that hungry, but I tried everything that my cousin ordered. We stuck to their late night special menu that is available 10pm-2am.  * Beef Tataki Salad - It looked amazing, but it lacked flavor. I think I've only ever had Beef Tataki at Ichiza and theirs runs circles around Osaka's. * King Crab Tempura - This was easily the best thing we ordered. Delicious. * Salmon Skin (half) Roll - This also lacked flavor. I'm kind of a purist in that I like to eat sushi exactly how the chef made it. I never use soy sauce or add wasabi. I stuck to my guns on this, despite the roll really needing the extra flavor. * Screaming Orgasm (ahi sashimi on top of some salad) - This also looked amazing. It had better flavor than the Beef Tataki, but I wasn't blown away by it. The dressing was a little too vinegary.  On the plus side, the service was excellent. The two ladies that served us were extremely friendly and attentive to our needs. The green tea tasted great and was the perfect thing on my still recovering throat. Whenever I was running low on tea, the lady would come back and top it off promptly.  I really hate giving less than three stars, but I must stay True to the rating system. Indeed, I have experienced better. It's too bad because the service and decor of Osaka are top notch.",

Do the locals dine there? Locals have been dining here since the 60's. Las Vegas is a young city, so right away that is telling. This restaurant is a Mecca for the cognoscenti (peeps in the know) which includes lifelong residents and the born and raised Las Vegans. They know where the good eats are in this city and Osaka has the goods!! One thing I love is the privacy of the seating which only accentuates the incredible dishes. The service is wonderful! Exceptional wait staff and bus people, not only do they take care of your every need but they are all beautiful to boot!! (Not that that is a prerequisite) but it doesn't hurt. I would encourage everyone, whether you live here or just visiting our unique city, to visit Osaka's Japanese Bistro for a gastronomical delight! Enjoy!!!",

When you have sushi chefs like Kenji, Jaime and Oscar you can't go wrong. They have a good variety of sake, and Asahi draft from Japan. This is a great venue, highly recommended!",

Don't be put off by the seedy area, it is located in the mini-mall with the mini statue of liberty statue and next to the store that sells, um... sexy attire. We were 5 adults and 6 kids and every single one of us were incredibly happy. We showed up for early 6pm dinner and were seated on tatami mats.  The menu is wide and varied, but it had things for picky non-adventurous types and others like me and my BFF who went for urchin and hand rolls and their specialty rolls.. The rolls were innovative. you can order individual yakitori freshly grilled, fresh ebi sashimi with their crispy fried heads, their udon was enjoyed by my 70 year old dad and 5 year old daughter, and the atmosphere made my manga-loving nieces very happy. The waiters handled our big ole table deftly and with patience. I recommend this place to anyone.",

The Pocket Ace roll was the most incredible combination of flavors--each bit from each roll we ordered was better then the last.  The menu is always changing, so it is 'new' all the time.  I am normally disappointed with desserts in Asian restaurants, but the ice cream filled fried pound cake was delicate, crispy and sweet.  I loved the fresh blueberries on top.  I've been to restaurants much pricier, but never better!",

When I walked in and was lost I walked out one of the servers chased after me to not go out the door bc it would set off an alarm. Thus begins the terrible service from the wait staff. They told me to just walk in even though I had no clue where I was going and were pushy. When I got done and settle with my friends to eat they got my order wrong twice. When I did receive my sashimi I had been disappointed by the size portion and the taste of one of the tunas made my tongue roll over and die. If you are going to serve sashimi at least make it fresh. The waiters were extremely confused when bringing out our dishes and slightly unprofessional where I literally thought they were all high. When it came time for the check I was very angry they included gratuity because the food was mediocre and the service was terrible save for just one waiter. You are better off avoiding this place.",

Osaka is almost like 3 different restaurants in one: a sushi bar, teppanyaki grill and Japanese restaurant. It is located way off the strip in a strip mall. We ate in the Japanese restaurant section that has low tables that you take your shoes off and tuck your feet under. Super fun! We ordered several sushi rolls, firecracker shrimp, miso soup and their house chicken soup. Everything was amazing! We got the Roponngi, Pocket Aces, and Kai Special rolls. My favorite was the Pocket Aces with the crunchy fried onions on top- yum! The rolls weren't super inexpensive but they were big and really fresh. Next time I'll come for happy hour. I'm so glad we tried this place. It's worth the Uber ride.",

Sushi bar is cramped and boring, only noise is from the tv showing some random show. Though their servers are friendly and helpful, the chefs are not. I dislike the feel of this place immensely.  Sushi and cooking is very average for above average prices. It's fresh enough, but flavors don't pop, nothing stood out, and a lot of their recipes are dated. And the half rolls on their happy hour menu really don't save you much.  They have Tatami rooms and a small teppanyaki grill area that feels like a fire hazard. Area of town is sketchy, parking lot feels unsafe after dark. Not going back.",

We came in right when they open since we were heading driving back home after.  Sushi was very fresh and good. We came in time for the lunch special and order every roll on the lunch special which can included a few signature ones. Hey why not, we definitely wanted to try it all. For sure it was worth it and we did finish it!   If your craving sushi come give this place a try and get the experience of the semi- traditional seating area.",

    "text": "A fun & funky place to bring friends and family!! Every time I step into this restaurant it makes me smile to be seated either on the floor or in one of the sunken booths. There's a great atmosphere shared by all.   I was with some sushi newbies, so we didn't venture out too far meal wise on this visit- although they offer quite the creative mix of rolls. I can't wait to try their Treasure Island - complete with capers and sliced onions and the El Pollo Loco, with chicken, asparagus and Japanese salsa! Say What?! That is my kind of loco!   For this occasion, we ordered: *Spicy tuna - a solid basic *Ribeye wrapped around asparagus - meat was on the tough side, with a flavorful sauce and succulent asparagus. Just an okay dish. *Chicken nuggets - the kiddo and big kiddos chowed down on these little nuggets  *Fresh White roll - My favorite roll of the night! Fresh, juicy albacore with hamachi, shaved radish, cucumber and wrapped in soy pap. It was delicate yet hearty. *Kai's Special roll - had some kick. *Lisa Lisa roll - this was kind of a standard, and our table's favorite. How can one go wrong with shrimp tempura done right?  Service has always been wonderful here, I can't think of one occasion where we didn't receive a greeting, smiles, a quick seat, explanations to questions, help ordering for anyone at the table, quick refills, sake flowing; it's all good. In addition to their funky rolls, they offer Special Boats that are quite a feast to the eyes. If you are looking to make an impression on someone, I'd say that's a sure bet. Then there is the Shabu Shabu, Sukiyaki or Yosenabe to try for yet more adventurous options. Life is good here; Adventure on!!",

We had the dragon roll and few other which I don't remember the name. I thought the price was high but the sushi was melt in your mouth good. I noticed they had a special free lobster teppan dinner for your birthday with purchase of 5 teppan dinner. Definitely want to try that out.",

There was no wait and the servers were friendly although it took them hella long to get our order even though all of our table was seated. Anyways we ordered beers and sake and we were gonna try the sake sampler nigori flight, but I was told it was super small and not worth it by a friend who had been there before. Anyways for our big group we ordered 3 large boats for 55$ each. I was like whatever because we were with a group but really I am Asian and this deal was the shittiest deal ever.  For 55$ you get 2 half or age slices (so basically 1 whole orange) 15 slices of crappy beef/steak that had no flavor except the teriyaki sauce they dumped onto it. And the chicken looked dry and freeze dried and was absolutely horrible. Also this 55$ boat came with 7 pieces of sushi. I thought it was gonna be at least nigiri but it was actually 2 pieces of salmon, 2 tuna, 2 white albacore and a shitty shittay flavorless imitation California roll. What a disappointment!!! I am so accustomed to have lots of sushi and nigiri and oh the best part of the boat was the tempura. Kinda oily but sadly the best part. I would come here again because I had fun with friends but the food was quite Terrible. We also ordered the Kalbi skewers and it wasn't Kalbi it was more like bi-bim-bap on a stick. Also the steak roll were terrible and dry. And the best thing was the sappo roll. Tasty refreshing and real fish.  The only thing that made this tolerable was the large Sapporo and sake. Ps my friend said the Cole slaw was good.  And also I asked for extra ginger an hour ago and it never came. See attached piece of chicken. It was freeze dried and no one ate it because it looked like rubbery dried intestines.",

I ordered the soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, firecracker shrimp, korean kalbi short ribs, and fried tofu. In total my order cost over $70.00. For that price I expect deliciousness; what I got was buyer's remorse.   The food arrived cold. Disappointingly included in my order was one small box of white rice and three containers of what had to be miso soup (which i did not order) but NO teriyaki, ponzu, or any kind of dipping sauce. I ate my tempura dry. The korean short ribs were so incredibly chewy I spat them out. The fried tofu was soggy and bland with a few spring onions thrown in the box. The softshell crab was dry with no flavor. It came with a cream sauce that was extremely runny compared to similar sauces I've had. The only redeeming dish was the firecracker shrimp - it was seasoned well, the texture was great, and it had just enough spice to make it tasty with a kick.  Overall the food was bland, dry, sloppily packaged for delivery, and a huge let down. I would not recommend.",

The spicy edamame was undercooked and weird. Couldn't finish it. Miso soup was good, and my green tea never stayed empty for long. I'll come back for non sushi items next time because the sushi is over priced for the quality you're getting. Love the tatami mat sections. The carpet is old and needs to be replaced and the bathroom was pretty much out of soap.  The service was great but the rest was mediocre. I'll try it again though because I want to like it.",

I loved the half rolls so we can try out a bunch of different rolls. The tempura ice cream dessert was to die for! I suggest this place for anyone who wants a late night snack.",

The chicken noodle soup had an odd taste to it. The tempera was ok - a bit heavy with oil. All in all it's worth going and a nice restaurant with good prices.",

Upon entering it's a immediately hallway directing you to go right, you would think once you enter the actual \"restaurant\" it would be one big open space, but you walk into another room where I think the sushi bar was and a few other tables. The rest of the restaurant is divided into rooms.. We had visitors from Canada with us and I almost felt embarrassed we took them to a odd restaurant such as this in a sketchyarea. We came on a Saturday afternoon as a party of 9. The major plus is that they offer their lunch specials 7 days a week, which is good considering other restaurants only offer deals on the weekdays. I ordered the bento \"b\" with chicken katsu as my main entree ($10). In addition, I ordered a tiger roll, made up of 4 pieces for $8. The bento included miso soup, gyoza, tempura, a tossed salad, and 2 pieces of CA roll. Everything was pretty standard, except the CA roll seemed a little heavy on the rice and less on the crab meat. I enjoyed the tiger roll and have nothing to complain about it. The piece used for the chicken was rather thin, but still a good size. And the tempura, was good because the batter was light and not overly greasy. The service was good for the most part as they refilled our waters regularly and were attentive to us. Nothing really stuck out to me and I don't live around here so I probably won't be back.",

I like sushi, so I was anticipating your usual run of the mill sushi, not expecting anything super fantastic.  Boy was I wrong!  I can't say enough great things about Osaka. The food is excellent! It tastes fresh always, and the variety of rolls is outstanding! There is something for every palate! Even my fiance who was not so keen on sushi, at least once a week asks me, \"so when do you want to go back to Osaka's?\"   The atmosphere is great! The minute you walk through the door you get greeted by everyone (or so it seems) you can sit in tables close to the bar, but I believe to get the full experience you need to sit in the Japanese room. Remember to take off your shoes!  All in all, if you want a sushi place with great friendly service, great atmosphere, and all with great prices, come to Osaka! I promise you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "The prices are the only thing keeping this place from being 5 stars...and maybe for some the location.  It has a weird entrance that is a brick wall hallway that you walk around to get in the actual restaurant , and outside it is surrounded by  sinful shops - but thats vegas!  I had the Japanese Lasagna roll (8 pieces for $7.95) which if you like creamy flavors is really awesome and probably one of the best values on the menu.  I asked about happy hour and it is just at the sushi bar from 4-6 PM.  I thought it was odd that no one was at the bar so I'm guessing the happy hour menu isn't so great but I don't know.  I split the Rock shrimp salad (one medium plate for $12 I think) and it was pretty good, not great.  The shrimp were kind of bland but the sauce was good - and the salad portion was just iceberg lettuce and a few carrots.  My date had the Jalapeno Tuna sushi special of the day (8 small pieces for $18) which she said was great.  She also had a half roll of the Dynamite roll I think (4 pieces for $7)  which was a shrimp roll with crunchy flakes on top.  I had a bite and it was well flavored but a bit hard to discern the flavors because of the crunchy/dry stuff they put on it.    Service was good and the coolest thing about this places is the intimate booths that are old school Japanese style where you take your shoes off and sit on the floor (there is a place to put your legs under the table however), but this might get uncomfortable for a some during a long dinner.",

The service was speedy and attentive as well. After ten p.m. Until closing at 2:00 they offer discounted dishes, and this is the menu we ordered off of. The seafood salad was fresh, but it had crab in it and I prefer Tuna or salmon this is just a personal preference thing. The rolls were all very fresh. They're shrimp tempura was excellent. This place is great for a date.",

However, once inside, you'll notice the ambience is nice and you will dine Japanese style.  Yes, taking off your shoes or flip-flops and sitting on the floor.  I must say that this is one of the best sushi places I have ever been to.   The sushi is good and the presentation is simple.  The udon is good as well, but I was unable to finish it.  I ordered the Oh My God sushi and I noticed that they added lettuce to their sushi.  I found it strange, but I found not difference in taste.  The sushi wasn't mind blowing and I don't know why they named it Oh My God.    Service was great.  Our (I went with my sister and boyfriend) server was always checking on us if we wanted more water or anything else to eat.  We only had to ask him once for refill.  He was always on top of things.    Overall, I wouldn't mind coming here again.  Maybe I should order the San Diego Salmon.",

    "text": "It's late on a Sunday night and the BF suggests trying out the original Osaka after having visited their second location a few weeks back.   Walking through the front door, you immediately face a wall.  Not the most feng shui I'm sure, but make a right down the hall and you'll see another entrance which brings you right to the sushi bar.  I noted to the BF that this location was way smaller, and he then pointed out they had more room in the back.  We took a walk down there after eating to check out their tatami room (lots of space), semi-private booths, and a hibachi grill area too.  They are pretty fancy here with slide shows running on a computer screen at every booth in the back.  I would be even more impressed if it was a touch screen where you can order all your food by pressing your selection.  That would be super high tech!    Anyway, back to the review and the food.  The menus are pretty much the same at both locations, for the most part.  From their late night happy hour menu, this is what we ordered:  * Shishamo ($2.80) - It came with three pieces.  Again a bit tougher than what I'm used to.  They seasoned it with black pepper, but I asked for some salt to give it a little more kick too.  * Korean-Style Spicy Chicken ($4.50) - It's literally stir-fried chicken with Korean spicy sauce on a bed of lettuce.  I wasn't sure if the lettuce was garnish or to eat.  Oh well, I ate it.  * Crazy Horse Roll ($4.20) - It's tuna, salmon, masago and mixed together with spicy sauce.  It's a very basic roll, but pretty good.  * Fire Roll ($3.90) - Crab meat and spicy sauce.  Unfortunately, it looks like the CA rolls you buy from the supermarket, but without the avocado in it.  It had a bit of kick in it.  And from their regular menu:   * Ankimo ($6.95) - Monkfish liver...oh how I love this stuff.  It's an acquired taste.  I like to soak my chunk in ponzu sauce and then break off a tiny piece and savor each little morsel.  The BF likes to dunk his piece into the sauce and then toss the whole thing in his mouth.  He likes to then mush it around in his mouth.  Haha!  They are known for their exotic and colorful rolls, and they can be a bit a pricey.  It's our unfortunate luck that the only two rolls we ordered were so visually boring.    Service: It wasn't too busy this late in the evening.  A handful of people at the bar and few people at the tables.  The BF had to ask for his soda to be refilled and the waitress never came back with his drink!  When he asked for it, the waitress got him another one.  Then a few minutes later, she came by and took his drink away!  (We were wondering why she did that.)  When she came back with his drink, she said she was refilling it again.  (I guess to make up for his drink disappearing in the first place.)  The BF asked for my own pot of tea since I'm a big tea drinker and to save them the trouble of having to refill my teacup every five seconds.  One waiter came by twice to take away dishes that we weren't done yet.  In the process, he would try to squeeze in between us to reach for the plate, only to realize there was still food on it.  And finally at the end of our meal when the plate was clearly empty, then he asked if he could take it!  We were amused.  And actually, when we are both done sharing a plate, we actually put it to the side to help them out for that reason - so they don't have to reach in between a couple of lovebirds.  Duh!       Don't forget that you can get a 10% coupon when you visit their website!  (Yep, there's pics of our food eats in the business profile!)",

    "text": "Since Raku was closed for the first couple days of the New Year, we had to search for another new place to eat. We found Osaka Japanese Bistro.  First of all, there's some history to this place.  It's been around for over 40 years so you have to assume they know what they're doing.  It's also in a slightly shady part of town where only locals should go or those who are lost searching for Ichiza find themselves.  We started off with some sushi rolls and sashimi.  Meh.  I've had fresher sashimi and better tasting roll combinations.  Although, I did like the fact Osaka offered half orders on most of their rolls.  The entree we ordered was a little better.  We ordered the John's Special and had a good time to sharing.  Tempura was battered a little heavier than I'm use to but the chicken and beef teriyaki had a good flavor.  The dessert was surprisingly good.  We had the green tea tiramisu (I know it's a traditional Italian dessert but doesn't it just sound Japanese?).  I would have never have guessed that the flavors of mascarpone and green tea would marry so well.  It was pricey but worth the experience.  Overall, I'd be willing to go back for late night eats, desserts, and drinks but will have to pass on having dinner here again.",

We were asked if we wanted to sit at the sushi bar or in a japanese room. We chose the room. It was cool because the room is really big and you get cushions to sit on, and you take your shoes off.  That's about the most exciting thing I can say for this place. The service was just alright. There were like 8 people in the whole restaurant and it took them almost an hour to bring 3 sushi rolls. They barely came by to see how we were doing, just seemed like they wanted us to leave.   The rolls were also kind of pricey, even being half off. They were alright, though. The fried banana was really good. I wouldn't come back to this place.",

Then you walk through to the 2 grills and the more private oriental style tables. In the next room is regular tables. The 2 grills use 2 different chefs, facing opposite directions. While we were eating we were watching the other chef in action. Our chef was funny, both chefs had prank tricks, and the food was some of the freshest tasting japanese food I've ever tasted. The fried rice was amazing, the chicken and shrimp were perfectly seasoned, the salad dressing was perfect, BUT the miso soup was...eh. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas.",
