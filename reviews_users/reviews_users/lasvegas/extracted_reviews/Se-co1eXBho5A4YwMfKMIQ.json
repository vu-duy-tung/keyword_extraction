My wife had the biscuits and gravy, but said it tasted like about what we could make at home with one of those packets of powder. In all we paid a whole lot for sow thing that was just not that good. We were very disappointed. The service is not great as well, which makes this a place we won't go back to. There are too many better places to eat breakfast in town to go back.",

The coffee is also delicious.  I stick to the same menu items, so I can't say too much about this place because I order the same thing and I don't eat a lot of foods loaded with sauces.  Compared to other breakfast spots, I do think Griddlecakes rates higher than most because of the food quality, cleanliness and service.  It's not a five star because I think they could do a little better in the food preparation, but really, they are a good spot worth visiting.",

I have never seen a person work as hard as this guy does. He greets, cleans and serves. He needs to bottle that energy, he'd make a fortune.  The person taking our order was very fast and thorough.  He placed the order quickly with the cooks and it was served with perfection. The food was delicious as well. I ordered a skillet breakfast as did my daughter. My wife ordered a Benedict. We couldn't stop raving about how good the food was, how friendly and efficient the service, and how enjoyable the entire experience. Even though they were short staffed due to the recent shooting tragedy, they managed to exceed our expectations.   Very glad we found this place and will definitely return. Try it, you'll love it as well.  To the owner, you have a great staff, don't let them get away!!",

Anyways, the menu for breakfast is sweet...there are so many choices from a hot griddle breakfast, chorizo and eggs, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, it goes on and on...  My eyes were definitely bigger than my appetite.  I stuck to my guns and chose from the pancake signature menu. The Blue jay was great! Added some turkey bacon on the side...

    "text": "I had high hopes to try this place after looking at the reviews and the pictures, but sadly I was very disappointed. We ordered the chicken and waffle. Although the breading of the chicken was good the chicken itself was super dry. We also ordered their special crepes and strawberries offer, but the crepes were not the traditional crepes. It was too thick and fluffy. It's like they took the pancake batter and just made them into crepes. The size was great however and my daughter loved that they didn't skimp on the strawberries. My husband's meat and eggs were just average, nothing too special.   The service is a 3 out of 5. We arrived and there was no line. The waitress said she was going to get a table cleaned and asked us to wait for a couple of minutes. She then just disappeared. Another couple arrived after us. Another waitress greeted them and seated them while we  were still waiting. While passing us, she said the same thing as the first waitress that a table is getting cleaned for us while it was clearly that two tables in front of us were empty and cleaned, but we waited patiently. I thought there were more tables in the back. A third waitress came to the front and looked at us. Then asked table for four? Then seated us at one of two empty tables I was getting a little irritated at this point but didn't say anything. About half way through out meal the first waitress that completely had forgotten to seat us, asked how everything was. I should have have said something about the dry chicken, but decided not to as I honestly just wanted to hit the road knowing they may offer to make me a new dish and we didn't have the time. My daughter was still working on her food so I just asked for a refill for my coffee, but the waitress left and completely forgot again. After being tired of waiting we just asked for the bill and left. We're from out of town, but probably will not recommend to friends when they are in town.",

    "text": "I woke up mid-morning and was in the mood for some breakfast-y food so I luckily came across this place and decided to try it out.  I was pleasantly surprised about the portions - you get what you pay for & you'll be able to have enough to take as left overs home. It's a cute american style breakfast/lunch spot and is open until 3pm every day. I wasn't able to take a picture of the menu but they have quite a selection & you can add or substitute with no issues. If you're not in the mood for a big breakfast, they have oatmeal and parfait options as well as a gluten free section which I thought was pretty neat.  The staff is friendly and very attentive. It's kid friendly, providing high chairs/booster seats as well as a kids section on the menu. From the looks of it, you can fit some big parties too since there's already tables put together and then there's booths in the middle of the restaurant.  The only reason why I didn't rate it 5 stars is bc of how warm it is inside. I overheard that some parts of the day the temperature can vary so maybe next time I'll go in earlier but they do have a lot of fans and our waitress did address how warm it was even though it wasn't so much of an issue to us. As a first timer 4 stars should be reassuring, so definitely try it out!",

There are very few tables. Our waitress was very friendly and the service was fast.   Now on to the food, the lemon blueberry pancakes were pretty good. They are huge and can probably feed like 3 people easily. I ordered corned beef hash, it came with eggs, potatoes and toast. The corned beef hash is the kind from the can like Libby's brand. Now I like canned corned beef over the real thing, so that worked for me. The potatoes were so plain, they needed flavor! And my toast was burnt as can be. But she was busy so I didn't even bother. Price wise, it's about average for a breakfast spot. Would I come back? No, I make a better breakfast at home.",

First of all we ordered the french toast bites, they came out super greasy and there was no liner on the plate. As the main dish we ordered the philly skillet with biscuits and gravy and that was the biggest disappointment.  The skillet was salty on one side and flavorless on the other side. The steaks were over cooked and overall there was not much flavor in them. There was three biscuits on the plate covered with lots of gravy to the point that we couldn't even see the biscuits. And when we flipped one of the biscuits it was burnt on the bottom, so we sent back the biscuits. I was hoping that we wont be charged for them since we didn't really eat them, but they charged us regardless. Personally I dont think I will be back here again.",

Unfortunately although the place was half empty they seem to be rushed because the food was half cooked and Inedible Bacon was almost raw. Because it was in a skillet and I'll put together there was nothing I could send back to have it cooked a little bit more. My wife had a waffle and it too was undercooked it was soggy before we even put butter on it. Breakfast is one of the simple list of restaurant dishes shame on you....",

Truly some of nicest and genuine people I've met. Love the food, even the coffee is good, and regular coffee usually sucks in most restaurants. Feels very homie here. Hands down friendliest and best breakfast place in town.",

Today was 110 degrees and we walk in around 11a and it was extremely hot in the restaurant with only swamp coolers around, mind you I'm 9 months pregnant and it was hot and uncomfortable. I got a Nevadan skillet and added Portuguese sausage. I was so excited to try it and it came out fairly quick. I took a bite into it and it really didn't have any flavor. The only flavor I got from it all was the Portuguese sausage. I thought it would be a little bit better...probably won't be back.",

I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine and my boyfriend had the Philly Skillet with a side of biscuit and gravy. This was one of the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had. EVER! I can't get over how good it was. The eggs were cooked so perfectly and the hollandaise was on point. The flavors were incredible. The side of potatoes was yummy as well. I highly recommend this dish. My boyfriend said he'd give his food 3 stars because it was a bit too starchy and he'd like it if the components were more balanced. He said his biscuit and gravy was also averagely good.   Additionally the staff is quick, attentive, and very nice. This place is great for vegetarians and gluten-free diners as well. Don't come here if you're vegan, you won't find much to eat. The only downside for me was that my coffee was only moderately warm. If I get some piping hot coffee and a happier boyfriend on next visit, I'll give this place 5 stars.",

I had the tuna croissant - tuna tasted off, no mayo on the bread - guess I had to ask for that to be put on the bread but it was dry.  Cheese not very flavorful.  Fries were best part of the meal.

    "text": "I was going to grab brunch with a couple of friends late Sunday morning. The group decided on DW Bistro. I was not thrilled with this choice. I've previously eaten there and didn't like their menu or service. I was told things would be different because they moved. We attempted to go to DW and even I didn't like about the place was the same. The menu was the same as the last location and there looked like 40 people waiting just inside the door with no clear line or indication in where the hostess is. So after 5 minutes in the mad house,  we left.   My friend guided us to Griddlecakes near by. I am so glad that he did. There was no line. We were greeted by someone opening the door and welcoming us. We were seated right away. As soon as we received the menus I was so happy for the change in venue. There were so many things that I found appealing compared to the other restaurant where I struggled to find anything I wanted.   I chose the Blue Jay (lemon blueberry pancakes) and added a side of bacon. One friend got the Monkey Business ( peanut butter pancakes). And added a side of home fries. My other friend got the chorizo scramble. We each shared bites. The portions were very generous for the price. Everything ordered was delicious.  I would have preferred the home fries to be more well done than what my friend received.  I'll request them that way the next time I'm here.   I was very happy with my order and liked it the best. I do wish the pancakes had been served with more blueberry compote but upon request I received more with no problem or charge. I was not a fan of the bacon. I don't believe the issue was the cooking but rather the product itself. The bacon was odd. If you told me that it was turkey or vegan bacon I would believe it. I think they should consider buying a different kind.   The service was excellent. Not only was our server attentive but other servers were as well. We felt very valued and well taken care of. I'm sorry I haven't been to this place sooner. This is the best breakfast spot I've been to in Vegas and worth the drive.",

My toast came out pre buttered and hot which is a win. Most places bring out cold toast and hand u frozen butter.  Our pretty waitress Mekhe (sorry if spelled wrong) waited on us on both visits. She's super friendly and always right there whenever u need anything. They play modern pop music on the sound system and as a bonus some of the waiters dance a little and sing along... not the girls I'm talking about the guys. Haha My favorite was the huge 6 foot 4 inch server who I caught dancing to Justin Bieber when he thought no one was looking.  So the foods fantastic and the staff is amazing but the best part is this place isn't even close to being as busy as other breakfast places in town. Another win.",

It was almost black when they brought it to me, just covered in gravy to hide it. Biting into it I found out that it was very tough and chewy.   The GOOD: Biscuits and gravy were very tasty, flaky biscuit and smooth gravy. The eggs were cooked to perfection, we also enjoyed a hummus dip with pita bread. I want to eat here a few more times to give it a full chance. We will be back.",

    "text": "The good: portions are large. Seriously if you don't eat much, consider sharing a plate with someone.   If your ordering pancakes a 1-short stack will do- it's 10 inches!  if your a monster then consider the 2 or 3 short stack. I love the variety of flavors, I had the lemon-blueberry stack, very delicious combo especially the deep lemon flavor which I expected not to taste.   I also had the Veggie skillet, eggs and veggies over the homemade potatoes are delicious, the veggies were tasty and I think it's better if you don't have them scrambled as it comes w/three eggs (any style) I had mine over easy, w/ your choice of toast OR biscuit and gravy(no meat- YESSS!!)- it would not be advisable to order the biscuit and gravy w/the skillet, it's way too much. I thought it would be a small biscuit - but I was wrong.   The bad: seating sucks, it's cramped, I had a table next to an annoying mother, and suffered her opinions on the Mets and why sharing your food with your siblings is important- she wasn't even loud about it, but that's how close we were. The chairs are so uncomfortable my ass was killin me while I ate and after. The coffee wasn't very good. And not that this matters much- but my server had \"resting bitch face\" it's hard to enjoy your meal when your server looks like she about to cut you.",

The menu all sounded good and I couldn't decide.  I ended up choosing the canned corn beef with over hard eggs and sour dough.  My boyfriend wanted to try 3 Churro style French toast.  Amber is super personable, attentive and has a great smile.  She did make dining here fun and checked on us regularly.  I loved my food but somebody else at the table said their food was really good but too sweet and I had eat half of his third French toast because it smelled amazing.  Win win, I wanted to try his and ended up being stuffed as we left here.  The tall gentlemen checked on us during our meal which was nice and later was at the podium to cash us out.  Great cook and the staff was so happy too!  They have good mood food.  The burger at the next table looked and smelled wicked awesome. :)  We'll be back!",

The chicken fried steak was cooked perfectly with no shortage of country gravy. The patatoes where probably the weakest part of the dish but still very enjoyable, especially paired with Cholula.  As for the pancake make sure you try it before and after syurp as it is night and day, but both are absolutely fantastic.  My girlfriend got the griddle skillet and a peanut butter pancake. The skillet was fantastic in her own words, the peanutbutter pancake was good too.  We will be back to eat here again and recommending it to friends.",

We ordered biscuit and gravy, it had two different color of country gravy , one was lighter which was on top of darker color of country gravy, it was obvious one was older and fresh on top. The biscuit it self was not hot and the gravy was room temperature. We also had philly skillet, the potatoes again was not hot and seasoning was un even one side was salty the other of the skillet didnt have a flavor. We asked the server to take the biscuit and gravy out because we didnt like it,she didn't ask why? And yet she charge us full price on the whole meal...so why? It's really disappointing... We trusted the review with 4 and half star we thought to give it a try. Very bad..",

For any other breakfast places out there...if you want to stay in business you better be making your stuff from scratch. There are too many good options in town to be messing around.

It was little bit tricky to find if you do not look them up ahead of time. The place is gorgeous inside. I love the big windows letting natural light in. The staff and the owner were all super nice and accommodating. They checked up on us so many times and even suggested specials that we can try for next time. They even gave us coupons for half price off our next visit!  Their specialties are pancakes but they have traditional breakfast food and sandwiches that they offer. I tried the Monkey Business because it reminded me of Chunky Monkey! It has good flavors and I really like bananas with peanut butter anyway so that is definitely a good one.   Overall, it was a pleasant experience. I will definitely come back and try their other pancakes!",

Looked on yelp and saw Griddle Cakes had great reviews for a breakfast lunch eatery - and just down the street on Fort Apache.     Looks like a new place, medium size restaurant.  Great customer service, the staff was pleasant and friendly.  It was slightly busy, but not much of a wait.  Many choices for breakfast foods and lunch - I would recommend it to my friends as a great breakfast place.  I will have to go back there for lunch.  Had a bacon and swiss cheese omelette with grilled potatoes - with a single plain pancake.  Although I just went traditional - the food was delicious.  You have to see the menu - they allow you to build your own omelette or pancake combination.  They also have signature dishes which I will have to try next time.  This place will be on my list of recommended eateries for sure.",

No pinko nonsense at this place though, their coffee comes out hot and delicious not to mention that they have been great with keeping me topped up.   Today I'm eating one of their skillets. The gobbler. Turkey sausage, egg, spinach, peppers and cheese over taters. Smells great and very satisfying.   I'm a bit upset with myself that I didn't get pancakes. Had the lemon and blueberry cakes last time... wow. Highly recommended but you better pack your insulin. Once I tucked in I just kept devouring every bite until I drifted into a food coma.   This place is a bit small so come early or off peak but definitely come.",

    "text": "I really like this place!!   I walked in and was greeted by this very nice young woman. She sat me and asked what I wanted to drink, like any restaurant. I asked her what she recommended and she told me she generally likes sweeter stuff, so she normally gets pancakes after every shift, then asked if I like sweeter stuff.   Normally, I'd jump all over some pancakes, but I thought I was super hungry. So I told her I was hungry for more than pancakes. She then recommended the hobo skillet.   Grilled onions, cheese, chopped up sausage links, served over potatoes.   YES PLEASE.  Eggs come with it too, and I'm boring when it comes to eggs. Scrambled every time.  Every. Single. Time.   Anyway, I waited about ten minutes, give or take a few minutes, which is fine, I expected that.   The manager or owner or whoever he was brought my skillet out, and it was sizzling and popping and I was trying to contain my drool. Oh, it also comes with toast. So, when I saw all of this food I knew I was in trouble. It was  waaaaay more than I could have eaten. So I start nibbling, it's really hot, which I like obviously. My toast came pre buttered which is fine, I like grape jelly and butter on my toast anyway :).   But then, I was drinking some of my milk, and I got pretty low, and it wasn't until then that I noticed there was a label on my cup. So I turned it around, just curious as to what it was.   Gold peak tea mason jar. Cute.  But the tea that was stuck to the glass and wasn't cleaned properly wasn't cute. At all.   Owner/manager/whoever dude walked by and I asked him for a new glass. He apologized as he saw what was wrong with it, and hurried back with a full non-gold peak tea glass of milk. Which was great and all. But it kind of made me question the cleanliness of the rest of the dishes.   I work in the food service industry, I know all about bacteria growth and what not.  In short: Food was great.  Service was great. Wash your dishes a little better, and it would be 5 stars.   I plan on coming back this Saturday so we'll see how great their flap jacks are.",

We ordered the s'mores pancakes with graham crackers, it was good but I felt like it was a little dry, good portion though for single stack. I got the ham eggs Benedict, it was yummy... the sauce was good and complimented the potatoes it came with gravy and biscuit l, I tasted like a lot of flour on the biscuit and the gravy was kinda bland... my hubby got the Philly cheesesteak grilled, it was huge portion but he didn't like it that much. It was dry and probably needs more flavoring. The hot chocolate was ok, the freshly squeezed orange juice was good, next time I'll have ice on it... the service is good and the place is nice simple and small. The price is ok too. I would still come back and try their other food on the menu. Just needs a little improvement",

I would like a little more peanut butter flavor but they were good. Biscuits are great and huge, gravy was a little bland but some pepper and Tabasco livened it up. Eggs were cooked perfectly and bacon was excellent.  Customer service was excellent, it's nice to still see great customer service. The pricing is right especially for the portion size your receiving.  Overall had a great experience and will be dining here again.",

I rarely order biscuits n gravy, but it's offered as a side so why not!  Totally worth it & added turkey sausage today which made it a meal.  A small order is big enough & only like $4.    Ambience nice, clean, simple & bright.  I like sitting in a booth looking out of the window lol new to actually posting anything on Yelp so adding more details.    8.13.16 Meekaj was our wonderful server again today.  She is great.  I got the Meat & Eggs, Turkey Sausage, super fluffy eggs!  Next time I have to remember to tell them to fry the potatoes longer, no big deal cause I like them crispy.  Jeff C. got a super yummy build your own omelette w/ all of the meats & cheddar.  He said it was perfection & not overwhelmed w/ cheese, the perfect ratios.  Once again I can't wait until next time!",

When we arrived, there was only one other gentleman dining there.  The staff grabbed us a high chair and it was dirty.  I ordered the orange juice and she brought out a large without asking me what size I wanted.  One sip and I had to let her know that the orange juice is spoiled.  She asked if I wanted another beverage but because I wanted fresh OJ, I asked if there is another batch.  She brought me a small so I can try and yes, this batch is fresh alright.  She then brought out a large for me.  I also ordered a corn beef hash which comes with three eggs, sad looking potatoes, and 2 pcs of toast.  I am used to the potatoes being nice and crispy...not here.  The corn beef hash was very mushy.  Needless to say, service was good, but the food was not; therefore, I won't be returning.",

We came in northbound and only found out when we'd turned around at the end of the shopping center.  It was worth the egg hunt!!  Speaking of eggs, my over mediums were cooked to perfection!  You may be asking why I make a big deal about an egg, but we over MEDIUM lovers will tell you there is a difference. So many places give you either slimy undercooked eggs or egg custard without the cream or sugar.   Okay, of my soap box and back to the review... I ordered my bacon extra crisp and it was perfect! Hubby got a skillet and said out lacked a little seasoning but it was good.  Lemon blueberry pancakes were tasty but lacked the fluffy lemon consistency I was looking for.    By far, the best part of the meal was our server, Liz.  She was perky and really seemed to like her job. She chatted with us on and off our entire meal.  She also told us of a location closer to our home.    I think we found our go-to place when visiting our doctor on this side of town!  See you next time, Liz!!!!",

I came here with a friend for a late lunch. I'll break down my visit into three sections.  Atmosphere: as soon as you walk in, the vibrant colors hit you. Its bright inside and welcoming. Theres about 10 tables, with three having the luxurious cushion seats (:p). I chose the cushion seats since I have lower back problems and they were comfortable. The music was low enough to have a conversation, but not enough to hear the table next to us listen in. The staff was welcoming as we sat.  Food: to sum it all up, it was on point. We ordered the monkey special pancakes and the arizona skillet. The pancakes were infused with a light peanut butter flavor with sliced bananas and nuts ontop. They werent right and definitely stood on their own without syrup. The phlliy had everything you'd expect in a sandwich - plentu of cheese, mushroom, and onion . The omelet came with choice of toast. The portion sizes are huge and worth the price.   Service: service was great - each time I went. We were given recommendations and knew the menu well.",

The waitresses, although nice, lack a sense of urgency and just meander around forgetting the simple things such as utensils  coffee refills and water. The food was good, not wow, but again, we did not have to wait for a table on  Sunday at 10 am. We'll probably come back and give them another chance. Hopefully they get better organized before they become popular and busy.",

Have had my eye on this place for a bit and saw the review's needed to see for myself. So many good pics of the steak and eggs so that's what I ordered. A fat juicy rib eye is what I got. Asked for medium rare and they cooked it perfectly. The hash browns were cooked nice and crisp,  and over medium eggs! Great menu options; if I could compare it to any other place in would say  its kind of like an Egg & I.  Service was great and the prices a were great as well. They also have a nice patio area that has some shade as well as plenty room inside.",

The second time I went here, I went for the protein oatmeal pancakes with bananas, pecans, and cinnamon. I can't remember the name of the pancake but it was awesome! You don't have to compromise your diet as much. These pancakes were delicious and it reminded me of oatmeal cookies without the raisins! Which I fell in love with instantly. I love how a simple pancake can taste so yummy. Oh and I ordered the raspberry drizzle on the side cause why not?   Apart from the yummy pancakes, the service is great! Nick is clearly a sweetheart and what seems to be either the owner or the manager here, was awesome as well. It was busy during this Sunday afternoon and he was helping out the waiters and waitresses. He also cracked a few jokes at our table. Will definitely be back!",

The red velvet was definitely decadent with all that chocolate syrup or whatever was drizzled in it. My daughter through she would hate my lemon blueberry batter and loved it.

Our server was nice and attentive, anytime we asked for anything it was brought quickly.  I had the traditional eggs Benedict which were delicious and made just to my liking. The home fries were under cooked, some pieces were still hard.   My boyfriend had the el gordo skillet which he thoroughly enjoyed.   All in all, we had a good experience and would return.",

    "text": "First off fair warning that the portions of the pancakes are HUGE! The full stack that goes for $11.99 are really big! If you have a big appetite then you'll definitely be able to demolish it at the restaurant but unlike my kids and I, we ended up getting to go boxes. Looks like this will be dinner for us too  staff was amazingly friendly, atmosphere was very casual and had a good vibe to it, not very big in space so if you come here with a party of 12 on their busy peak time good luck! Pancakes were flavorful but a tid bit dry for my taste based on what we ordered which was the Monkey Business,  The Lover and S'mores and took the Philly Skillet to go. I'll update once we try it out. Love that the location is not too deep in Summerlin. Closer to the Southern Hills Hospital so it gives you a general idea where its located at in the city. Definitely will be back",

I'd give it a 5 star next time if they put more chocolate syrup and peanut butter . I will come back again to see if there's a change .",

I think that the pancakes look delicious and all the sweet options, but our omelettes/scrambles and eggs benedict was very lackluster. Even before we entered the restaurant it looked very spacious from the outside however it is very small and crammed. We were constantly having to stop eating or drinking just to move our chairs out of the way while eating. You feel like the people walking by are way too close, and the seats are so close together. I ate with two other people and we were so uncomfortable and close that it made us want to leave. I do want to go back and try the sweeter options and pancakes but our experience here was not great.",

    "text": "This place was wonderful! My wife and I have brunch almost every weekend and this place ranks near the top. Came with a party of 6 around 11:30am on a Saturday and they were able to sit us right away. Our party primarily stuck to ordering the pancakes and griddles. All the pancakes that were ordered were super big, fluffy, and had a unique crispy bottom. I would think that a single stack would be enough for one person and a double stack could comfortably feed two light eaters. The skillets were pretty good, but lacked that extra \"something\" that the pancakes had. 5 stars for great service and great pancakes!\"",

Pluses were that the decor was nice and it seemed clean.   We ordered our food and that's when the problems started. Food took a while to come out. They seem to be understaffed because there was only one waitress for about 7 tables. The omelette was plain and the potatoes were very underdone. The waitress was very busy so we didn't want to ask for anything else. The pancakes had a good flavor but a little mushy in the middle. The coffee was good.   There is a good variety on the menu but because service is lacking I probably will go else where next time. It's a shame because it's so close to my house.",

Another gentlemen ended up taking our order as I think he noticed us just sitting there.  I had a skillet and the wife had pancakes.  My skillet was just ok.  Nothing remarkable from other breakfast joints in town.  The wife did enjoy her blue Jay pancakes.  I wouldn't go back just for the skillet, but if you want pancakes I think those were the better call. Nothing wrong with this place just nothing spectacular like we read in other' reviews so really can't give it more than an average score.",

The waiter could see we were in a rush and he took care of us right away!!! I mean A+ service.. the food was !!!! My nephew couldn't stop talking how huge the pancakes were. I love the fact that this place had a family atmosphere.... Seriously I wish I remembered the waiters name... He was short staff and kicked butt!!! I wish I could give him a shout out. You need to try this place!!!",

Gluten free waffles and pancakes available and a few options if you like gluten free chow. Hey i know this is totally off what I'm about to say but.... a full size fork  rather than a salad fork which the restaurant have will work better while eating. But who cares, salad fork works too. ( maybe i just have a big mouth hehehehe ) I'm just going blah blah blah about at the fork. Oh well Happy Gridlling! :) food is good!",

    "text": "Was looking for a brunch place and Griddlecakes got really good reviews so naturally me and some friends had to try it out! We ordered the country combo, ACE eggs benedict, and a full stack of the buttermilk pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs and sausage links (my friend ordered these and I personally wanted to try the signature pancakes but whatevs lol). I thought the pancakes were pretty good, they taste very similar to IHOP's pancakes, which don't get me wrong that's a good thing! But they are much bigger and thicker! The country combo didn't disappoint either, I found that the gravy was pretty tasty. The eggs and sausage were pretty standard though, can't complain. Same with the house fries. I'm glad they weren't under or overcooked like some places tend to do. However, my absolute favorite dish was what I ordered, the ACE. I think they might have put crack in the hollandaise sauce because that, in combination with the bacon, made this dish SO good. I scarfed it down haha! I probably should have ordered another one. But apart from that, service was good and it was not too crowded surprisingly on a Memorial Day Monday. I'll be back!",

We placed an order for a waffle, biscuits and gravy, chicken fingers with fries, side of bacon, and the sirloin melt. The waffle was soggy and dry, it tasted like it was made water and flour only. The biscuits and gravy was horrible, the gravy tasted exactly like water and a dash of powdered gravy stirred together. The side of bacon was $4.05 and came with 3 tiny, wilted pieces of bacon which tasted like rubber. The chicken fingers reminded me of what you would get at Denny's and the sandwich was lack luster as well. For the price of $47, the food was overpriced and horrible. It tasted like cheap dinner food without the cheap price. Very very dissatisfied and disappointed with the food at GriddleCakes. Absolutely avoid this place!",

From the moment we walked in to \"fuel up\" before our Hoover Dam excursion, we felt right at home :) Our server, Amber, was the perfect example of hospitality and professionalism. She helped us with our orders and \"combos\" for tastebuds and was very familiar with the menu (that is CLUTCH for newbies). When our food arrived - pancakes & eggs, gobbler griddle (or was it skillet??), and an array of breakfast meat, we knew we hit the breakfast spot jackpot! AND, for my \"no pork\" dietary restriction, I had MULTIPLE options - chicken apple sausage, turkey bacon, turkey sausage, and meatless gravy for my biscuit!!! This is because the owner doesn't eat pork well, hahaha. He must be culinary kindred  spirit ;) Fear not bacon lovers, they have the traditional pork options as well ;) ;) Highly recommend this place for a sure-fire breakfast to start your day off right!",

    "text": "Right when we walked in, we were confused by the setup. Did we have to wait for a host to seat us or can we seat ourselves? We stood for a good minute when someone approached us. Clearly, this host/server did not appreciate us just standing there because she did not smile which already gave us an impression that we were not welcomed there. But the service picked up when our actual server took care of us and she was always prompt in asking us if everything was okay.   Now to the food. We got the corned beef hash, a breakfast skillet, and a short stack apple pie pancakes. My overall rating for the food is 2 because of the price and basic everything tasted.   First off, the side potatoes for my Abby's corned beef was the same potatoes used for my skillet. I'm 100% convinced that they cooked it ahead of time and just threw our plates together by either microwaving it or cooked each ingredient separately. I say that because man, did my skillet looks so disappointing. The chicken was so dry and bland. Then there were bits of spinach threw in there as though the cook stir-fried it for a bit and added it to the skillet.  That was the same for the mushrooms, and the overcooked scrambled eggs. I probably could've cooked an even better meal if I just made breakfast at home.   The pancakes are huge. So you might want to consider one if you're going to have it as a side. Or not because they're not that great. They taste like pancakes you make from the box; just add water! Nothing was notably delicious about it and the only thing that made it an apple pie pancake was that they threw an apple pie filling on top. I would not be surprised if it was from a can.   Overall, I would not come back because of the average food, high price, and unwelcoming host.",

We had the red velvet and the monkey business.  Also had bacon, sausage, eggs as sides. I thought the red velvet were suppose to come with whipped cream cheese but it was regular whipped cream.

There was a hostess in the front to greet you as you walked in the door which was nice considering how busy they were. The place was pretty small and they ran out of high chairs so we had to make do with putting two chairs together for the baby's car seat.   The menu wasn't too extensive and it helps to look at other reviews on yelp. We ordered the  Monkey business and Chorizo scramble.   I personally love anything with peanut butter. Sadly was disappointed when I tried the monkey business. The pancakes were a bit dense and I felt like I had to add a ton of syrup because they were missing the peanut butter flavor. The chorizo scramble was better than the pancakes. The flavors of the chorizo was good and I thought that dish was very tasty.   Overall, the service was good and towards the end the staff was more attentive to us which was nice. I would try other things than the pancakes though.",

    "text": "I really WANTED to like Griddlecakes more.. I WANTED it to be a 5 star place. It's basically in my backyard, it's super cute, clean, the service was good, the prices were fair, the portions big, and the freshly squeezed OJ was amazing.  Unfortunately, my food was just ok. I ordered the blueberry lemon pancakes and made it a combo, which came with 2 huge pancakes, eggs, and your choice of meat (I got the sausage links). The eggs were fine, pretty hard to mess up scrambled eggs. The sausage was good too. But the pancakes, the star of the show, were sadly pretty average. I didn't taste any lemon, there was lots of  blueberry compote and blueberry, though. They were big, so I definitely had food leftover, but they just didn't \"wow\" me.   I would return and try some of the other items, they had some good looking omelettes and skillet plates. But for pancakes, perhaps another location. Pity.",

    "text": "If I wasn't focused on the gluten free breakfast I might have given them a higher rating.    I was drawn to this place by their gluten free menu.  Most places that offer gluten free have a limited menu and Griddlecakes was no exception.  But they did have their signature GF griddlecakes on the menu, so of course that's what I ordered.  I thought I needed something to round out my breakfast so I ordered a couple of sausages and eggs as well.  That really wasn't necessary because the griddlecakes were huge and there were two of them.  Loaded up with butter and syrup, they were all - or more than all - a normal person should eat.  And like a lot of GF flour based fare they were heavier than their wheat-flour counterparts.  Sadly, the griddlecakes had a floury under taste.  I would recommend a talk to the staff about how it could be corrected before ordering them again.   On the other hand my wife had a country fried steak with gravy she rated as very good.  And she absolutely loved the pan fried scrambled eggs,, which looked more like scrambled eggs from home than the battered eggs you get most places.  She is also our coffee connoisseur and said the coffee was bitter, but if it wasn't for different tastes there wouldn't be 100 flavors in the supermarket.    The staff was very friendly and helpful.  They kept coming back to check on us and kept our coffee cups full as well. The setting was fresh and different.  It was sort of 1950's made modern.  Hard to describe, but real nice.  The place is small, but luckily wasn't busy when we got there and we had no trouble getting a table right away.",

I discovered Griddlecakes on yelp and thought I'd give it a shot based on the reviews, the photos, & the menu.  I've been craving the country fried steak so I got that. Chocolate pancakes for my son. My cousin had the corn beef hash & eggs. My mother had build her omelette! And we all shared The Lover, which is Red Velvet pancake.   Country Fried Steak: 9/10 - the steak was the perfect size for me, 3 sunny sided eggs, & it came with potatoes. The reason why I gave it a 9 because it kinda needed a little bit more seasoning.  Chocolate pancakes: 9/10 - was humongous! It was just 2 huge chocolate plank ales with butter on top. I was looking forward to it looking more chocolate-y. At least maybe with chocolate syrup. But my son did have it with warm syrup.   Corn beef hash & eggs: 10/10 - my cousin enjoyed her meal!   Omelette: 9/10 - was with spinach, chicken, mushroom, & American cheese. My mother enjoyed it but she said it seemed some seasoning   The Lover: 10/10 - red velvet pancakes was huge!  Beautifully represented and quite delicious. My family and I could not eat the whole thing!   Overall, we had a wonderful experience! The customer service was excellent. The staff provided such a friendly environment for us and the food was good as well.   Thank you Griddlecakes for the wonderful experience! I definitely would come back again!",

    "text": "I should start this review by saying that integrity means a great deal to me. With that being said, Griddlecakes offers 10% off for customers who write the business a review. This review is written solely on my experience and was not used as a discount tactic. In fact, Yelp has a no tolerance policy on the matter.  Now onto my experience at Griddlecakes. Upon walking in, we were a tad confused on the seating arrangements as there were no signs for direction or a host. After standing for a short while, we were greeted by one of two servers. She sat us down at a booth/table. The seat on the booth side sinks down a lot. I moved around quite a bit to get comfortable. Our waitress was very nice; however, she did not introduce herself or wear a name tag. Aside from that, she was very sweet.  The Arizona Skillet was okay. We substitute the green peppers for mushrooms. The ground beef in the skillet was overcooked and dry. Fortunately, with some hot sauce, it was a tad better. Biscuits & Gravy came as a side to the skillet. It was decent. The biscuit itself had a great buttery taste but crumbled rather easily. The gravy was good; although, I wish there was country sausage in it. The Lover is red velvet pancakes topped with strawberries, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and powdered sugar.  The pancakes were much bigger than I expected and probably my favorite of the entrees.   As for my overall experience, I can't say it was great. Griddlecakes has some room for improvement. I don't think I will be rushing back anytime soon.",

This food was great; I got the Chicken and Waffles and my friend got the Chorizo Scramble. The chicken had tons of flavor on it and it balanced really well with syrup. The waffle was well made, very moist and flavorful. The only downside was there wasn't enough syrup (there was only one packet) which obviously would be remedied if I dined in but just a heads up to those ordering out, ask for extra syrup. The chorizo scramble was really good, very flavorful and spicy. The tortilla made a nice pairing, but there were huge chunks of potato that seemed too much. I also got the orange juice and it was amazing, that I highly recommend. Very fresh and refreshing. Maybe we'll try to dine in one of these days and try their other menu, so far I've enjoyed it so definitely",

    "text": "Came here for breakfast with a friend and looking at all the reviews and pictures I was looking forward to it. I ordered the phillycheese steak skillet. It consists of home style potatoes topped with thinly sliced steak sirlon with cheese and eggs however you like. This was probably the worst I've ever had. The steak had a weird taste to it. Like a meat gone bad? Potatoes were under seasoned, even ketchup couldn't save it. Only good thing was the scrambled eggs it came with. You also get a choice of toast or biscuit and gravy. I chose the biscuit. Honestly biscuit was good. My mistake with this was not asking for the gravy on the side. The biscuit was drowning in the gravy when I got mine. So I scrapped off all the gravy as best as i could and tried eating the biscuit without the gravy, because it was just way too much.  Overall, I don't think I would come back.",

I ordered the \"The Lover\" which is a red velvet pancake topped with chocolate drizzle, powdered sugar, whipped cream, and strawberries. You can order 1 stack (this was already filling for me already, short stack - 2 pancakes, and full stack - 3 pancakes. Highly recommend if you are craving pancakes! The flavors blend well together, and do not disappoint. They also have a variety of other breakfast items if you prefer something else.  On a separate note, this place gets real packed on a Saturday morning. Average wait is about 15mins. But it's worth it!",

Staff was friendly and accommodating to us needing to fit a high chair in the small space. We waited maybe 5 minutes if at all. Server was great, let us take our time to order and suggested looking at their Instagram for reference photos- great marketing btw! I got the chicken and waffle and have to say the flavor of the waffle and the chicken were two totally new flavors, and insanely good! Didn't taste like your typical chicken, OR waffle. We will definitely be returning to try some lunch items!",

Seriously the pancake was cooked perfectly...light and airy...with a tinge of crispy edge ... and flavor was just the perfect amount of decadent. Yesssss Griddlecakes for the WIN today!",

Had a line for Sunday brunch which was expected but I wish they had a better waiting area.   Service: the person at the front counter was also the one that seated us. She has no business working in the service industry. She just stared at us when we walked in...no smile, no \"hello\", nothing. I had to ask if she could put us down for 2 ppl. Same thing when we finally got a table, she still had that same RBF.  The server we had was great. She was pleasant and took good care of us.   Food: I had the big Nevadan skillet and it was awful. It was overloaded with potatoes with very little bit of beef, bacon and eggs. Tasted bland and I had to smother with ketchup and Tabasco just to get some flavor.  Other item we had was the chicken pesto. My daughter loved it.",

The wait was about 15 minutes and there was only standing room inside because it was about 40 degrees outside!  Pros:  Price was just right for the amount of food you get.  Pancakes were HUGE (the waitress tried to warn me) Everything came out quickly and warm.  S'mores pancakes were awesome! My daughter had them and everyone at the table tried a piece. Excellent!! The bacon was delicious, perfectly fatty and crispy at the same time.  Everything was really tasty! French Toast, chocolate chip pancakes, home fries, bacon, apple chicken sausage, eggs, s'mores pancake, and buttermilk pancakes.   Cons: The space is tiny and close together. Not much room for patrons. No real waiting area.  One restroom.   Overall this place was a hit!!! The food and service was fantastic. Two mistakes were made on our order and the waitress corrected one immediately on the bill. The other mistake we gladly ate (extra bacon). We are definitely adding GriddleCakes to our Nevada road trip stops.",

Even ask for some gravy that was hit. And got some that was only slightly warmer than what's we were originally served. Orange juice was just a little too good to be True. Might just have some added sugar. Salt and pepper shaker on our table were disgusting. Tops and sides. Wait staff were really friendly. That's about all I got. Prices weren't bad for the portions.

Our friend didn't love the flavor of the chicken or the waffle. Their tuna sandwich was flavorful. We also ordered a Lumberjack combo that has eggs, bacon, potatoes, and pancakes. We upgraded pancakes to lemon blueberry batter. The eggs, bacon, and potatoes were nothing fancy. We expected more when comparing it to some of our other regular breakfast spots. The lemon blueberry pancakes were good and I had not had that flavor anywhere else. There was also only one server and they could defiantly use at least two people working to better manage guests needs. It took a while to get ketchup, syrup, and toast for our orders. I doubt we will be back. I would only come for strictly pancakes.",

If this is made inhouse from scratch, they should taste their food as they cook. Its bland. Waitress was sweet, but never asked how my food was, lol",

The only thing edible was the toast and that was only because I was starving! They should just go to Costco and buy the canned corned beef. That would've been 10 times better than the deli meat that used.",

    "text": "Not only do they have great food, the customer service matches their food. So my daughter picked this place for her birthday lunch(20 years old today!!) because she wanted breakfast. We got there and was immediately greeted and seated when we arrived. Since this was our first time there my daughter didn't know what she wanted and the server came back a few times to check on us to see if we were ready. One thing that really stuck out to me was when we were ready and she was saying what she did and didn't like the Server told her tell me what you want and we will do that. she wanted the pancake with sausage but no egg. Sometime in the conversation I called her birthday girl and when our food was brought out, the server also gave her a birthday waffle and wished her happy birthday. That blew us away, there are not many places these days that would do something like that to make someone feel special. The place was nice and clean and the staff was attentive and friendly. Now on to the food, both of our skillets were the best we have had in Vegas my one critique was on the philly one a little more meat. Other than that they were cooked to perfection with just the right seasoning. My daughter loved the waffle most of all, she said it was nice and fluffy and the strawberry syrup that was drizzled on it made it so good. She liked the pancake with the strawberries(she liked the strawberries were sweet and she didn't have to use a lot of syrup and sausage was good. She liked the birthday waffle the best, said it made her day. Thank you Griddle cakes for the good food and making a birthday girls day a little extra special!",

I couldn't even sit in my chair because of the group at the table behind it so I had to sit on the side of the table until they left. You could very easily hit the person behind you with simple movements.  There were a lot of choices on the menu that we wanted to try. My boyfriend ordered the daily special, \"Carne Asada Skillet,\" I ordered the \"Crab Cake Eggs Benedict,\" & we shared the \"Birthday Cake Short Stack.\" The food was okay, but nothing extraordinary. You can tell that the steak & crab were cheap quality. I prefer my house fries to be crispy & thin, but they made theirs thick & soft. Their pancakes were a good size.  Other than that, everyone was very friendly & they provided great service.",

Waffles was good but the chicken tasted old and maybe even under cooked. It had NO FLAVOR and the texture was rubbery. I took a few bites off the edges but then I couldn't eat anymore.  My kids shared the short stacked birthday cake pancakes. They ran out of strawberries so they topped it off with bananas. To my surprise, my kids took 5 bites and that was it. My kids love pancakes! What kids don't? I tried a bite and it seems like the pancakes were under cooked.  My husband ordered the corn beef and hash meal. He said he didn't even know If the food was horrible, he was too hungry to notice lol.  Overall, I was a completely unhappy customer. Ordering 3 entrees with 2 sodas and a coffee it added to $42, wasn't even worth going there.",

The egg was poached perfectly and the hash browns that came with it were delicious too. The pancakes came out soft and fluffy just the way I like them.  I highly recommend this breakfast joint to anyone in the area to go try.",

Apparently it's so a party of 4 can sit.  Now the food is good and huge portion. Bland. Pancakes huge but dry. I feel like the waitress should have been a little proactive by letting us know of the portions, but understandably so the upsell is obvious.   I ordered the strawberry pancakes and got a small order of strawberries w/the order of these huge pancakes with no butter. I felt at some point that I had to ask for butter, for a plate, for more coffee so that I can maneuver eating breakfast. The waitress not so great, nice, but ditsy.   I can say this will be a 1st and last for me...",

Decided to give it a try, this place is very small and jam packed as expected for a Saturday morning . We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. But the service, food , atmosphere was all 4 stars for us. We were greeted repeatedly from the time we walked in. I had a custom egg,spinach and cheese burrito. Daughter had French toast, husband had the Portuguese Sausage , all of which were delicious. The food was hot!!! So hot I could hardly eat the burrito. Got our boxes and the check fast as well. If we are ever in the area again we will  be eating here again.",

My husband brought it home and one look at it and you could tell the corned beef was so dry. It was beef jerky style. Already bummed that my $20 breakfast was a dud! The potatoes were good though so I'll give them a star for that. Another star for the portion size of my eggs (3 over easy eggs cooked over hard but that may be a to go issue) and the size of the red velvet. I asked my husband to order me a small stack of red velvet and I ended up with 2 humongous pancakes. Is that the short stack? I'm not sure. So portion sizing is great but the pancakes were just ehhhh. The cakes were so dense and hard to eat and there was chocolate syrup? all over the top which I didn't really like...maybe I just like my pancakes fluffy and light. Overall I wasn't impressed by the food except for the potatoes. I'll give it another chance one of these days though since it's so close to home.",

They truly care about their customers opinions and they listen to their requests. The food is delicious. I had the protein oatmeal pancakes with fresh strawberries and bananas and It's the first time I have not needed syrup. My gf ordered the country fried steak and eggs and the whole plate was fresh and delicious. The steak was crispy but tender. The potatoes were so flavorful. This is definitely a place you have to try. If you want somewhere that cares about their customers and focuses on the batter not the syrup, then you have to try griddlecakes. Thank you guys for a great first experience!",

Griddlecakes DOES it, though! The stack was fluffy, eggs, bacon and potatoes cooked to perfection and EVERYTHING served piping hot HOT!  It's like the food goes from griddle to plate to table in 30 seconds. Staff is on top of things and super efficient and work in a friendly teamwork environment. Everyone was attentive and courteous.

I just don't understand how someone with any cooking experience at all can mess up hollandaise. It's literally 3 ingredients. But anyways... my sister had a dry chicken sandwich with a piece of chicken that was way too big for a sandwich and hardly any additional condiments or veggies to compensate. Just a big fat hunk of flavorless chicken sandwiched between to smooshed pieces of Texas toast. The pancake was good and fluffy and would have been the only glimmer of hope in this meal if it didn't taste like grilled onions. But the service was excellent.

It was 3 eggs, turkey sausage, peppers, onions, spinach and cheese on top of breakfast potatoes with a side of biscuits and gravy. I substituted the turkey sausage for pork which made it so much better, in my humble opinion. The biscuits and gravy were very good. Light biscuit and perfect sausage gravy.  The portions were ample enough to share and take a bit home.  Substitutions are not a problem. They are very accommodating seemed more than willing to customize to individual taste. I definitely want to go back and try the griddlecakes, the ladies at the table next to us had the original and pb and banana. They looked wonderful and the ladies eating them were euphoric. The ladies that waited on us were very sweet and attentive. Quick to keep the coffee and tea cups full. Warm greetings when we entered and thanked us as we exited. I am anxious to try the location closer to home. We will definitely be back.",

The pancakes were huge and pretty decent, pancakes just are not that exciting to begin with, I just had a craving.  My friends got the skillet things those were pretty good.  I really liked their home style hash browns? potatoes? It was something like that, they were chunks of potatoes with a nice crispiness to it.   The best and most dangerous item we ordered was the churro waffle. We split the waffle for the table, it tasted like the best churro you've ever had mashed mashed into a waffle. Taste so good but probably going to give you diabetes if you finished the whole thing by yourself.",

We were immediately greeted at the door. At the entrance there is also a chalkboard showing their specials for the day.   Our waiter came and took our drink orders. YOU MUST GET THE ORANGE JUICE!!! There are many places that claim that they have fresh squeezed oj but this orange juice here is the real deal!!!   For our food orders, I went with the Philly skillet, and my wife ordered the birthday pancake. My skillet was really delicious, 3 eggs made to order over a bed of nicely seasoned home potatoes (I say nicely seasoned, because they weren't too salt like other places). The pieces of steak were very tender, overall I really have nothing negative to say about the delicious skillet.   The birthday pancake looks and tastes exactly like what you think it would. Funfetti batter, strawberries and raspberry drizzled on top with whip cream on top. I was thinking this pancake would be a bit too sweet but it was surprisingly not. The pancakes are big, no measly baby flap jacks here!   I'm glad that my wife and I gave this place business because we will be coming back.   Quick review.  Service is fast and tentative  Food portions are good for the price  Orange juice is really hand squeezed  The potatoes aren't rolled in msg and salt",

But we must have had first-timer's luck b/c we came on a Sunday around 1130 and had no wait at all (yay!)  Super personable, friendly & attentive staff.  The owner stopped by several times.    It's not foo-foo, fancy breakfast/brunch.    So if you don't care about the hype of being seen in the latest brunch joint w/ a DJ at brunch, you'll get an enjoyable meal of good food here.   The food was good to great.   Had the birthday pancake (my least favorite.. pancake was a little less hearty/thick than I like but I ate it & enjoyed it), bacon (YUM!!!! 'Nuff said), biscuits & gravy (biscuit was fluffy, gravy was good+ but not overly flavorful) and the Philly skillet w/ 2 poached eggs (the \"steak\" was like steak 'um meat so not 5-fantastic, but good & the poached eggs were near perfect).  I ate everything (or at least some of everything) & enjoyed it so will be back.    Yes, I over-ordered!!!  Portions are large.  But I wanted to take leftovers home to hubs who didn't get invited to brunch w/ the girls.   Only thing that would make this place a 5 is mimosas.  Hopefully they're working on that.",

Food was okay... not what we thought it was going to be. My kids love red velvet pancakes and they both described theirs as \"regular pancakes w/red dye. No flavor what so ever\". Hubby and I shared their French toast. Nothing amazing just your standard French toast. I was upset because I ordered the meat & eggs. It said I could have a choice of Portuguese Sausage w/my eggs, so that's what I ordered. Being from the islands that's our favorite! THAT WAS NOT PORTUGUESE SAUSAGE!! It was hot links! I was irritated by that. I think they should fix that on their menu. So anyhow, that is the reason for the 3star rating.",

It also comes with eggs & choice of meat-- I requested my eggs to be over medium-to hard & stated that I didn't like them super runny. Well, they came extremely runny (Over easy). They were very kind about getting new eggs made (although didn't apologize & took my entire plate with my meat still on it) and brought it back with just eggs. My potatoes were not fresh at all and cold..so I requested new ones & again, they were very willing to bring news one (didn't apologize). I'm not super picky, but I like my food FRESH. Who doesn't? I unfortunately had a terrible 1st experience.... but I'll give 2 stars for the staff being very kind & welcoming. I'd give them another try someday!",

I'd recommend coming before 12pm on a Sunday. The prices are a little overpriced for the location. They seem like strip prices. Here's the detailed review:   Service: water and drink service was quick. The host offered water and coffee as soon as we sat. Later, a server (A) approached and asked us if we needed help with choices. It was a little rushed and felt a little pushy for my liking but I'm assuming it is because she knew the rush was about to come.  Food: I got the omlette: it was 7/10 - I'd order it again. They don't allow you to substitute potatoes for fruit unless you pay an extra 1$ / home potatoes are a HUGE pass.  Pecan Pancakes: no flavor and he barely ate it. I'd pass.  All in all, it's a nice atmosphere and service was friendly but rushed. 7.5/10",

I liked the taste of actual raspberries in the pancake, but the drizzle almost tasted like it was artificial raspberry.   The eggs, potatoes, and sausage I ordered were plain. Not bad, but not worth writing home about.   Service was decent though!",

Their food, esp their pancakes, are so good. They have a good variety of pancakes but the basic buttermilk pancakes are some of the best I've personally had. The staff is also always nice and attentive. We got Amber as our server for today's visit. She made sure were were taken care of (which was really appreciated when you have three kids to look out for). She just rocked! So a big Thank You to Amber.

    "text": "So we are at the end of our meal and do have a review to give.   1) I ordered the El Jefe- which is a chopped steak with peppers, onions, tomatoes, and home-fries served on a open-face flour tortilla with eggs. My first impression is the food is very bland. No seasonings whatsoever. I get that some places will not put salt or pepper due to \"salty\" complaints, but one should at least attempt to flavor their foods. The \"chopped\" steak looked like sliced beef you would use for a philly.  2) My fiancee order the Country Fried Steak and Eggs. Again, very bland, no seasoning. She couldn't even taste the seasoning in the batter used to fry the meat.  We also ordered the Half Biscuits and Gravy. Yet again, another let down. These biscuits are amazingly fluffy and airy.. very similar and highly comparable to Blue Berry Hills biscuits. The sad part came in their form of \"gravy\". Again, very bland and tasteless. It's almost a disgrace to put this \"gravy\" on these awesome biscuits.  We also tried the Short Stack Monkey Buiness Pancakes. Yep!! You guessed it! No flavor at all either. The pancakes are supposed to be peanut butter batter... this has to be the blandest pancake batter I have ever tasted.   Whenever we go to a new place to eat, I always try to sit by the kitchen. The cleanliness of the kitchen is always an indicator of the type of food service coming out of it. We sat right by the opening of the kitchen entry (open entry, no doorway) and the first thing we noticed is how dirty the floor is. Yes, I know a working kitchen is supposed to have a dirty floor, but it looks like they do not sweep the floor all day until close to closing time. By the amount of food and trash on the floor, one would assume this kitchen does 300+ covers a day.   My kids had the kids bacon and eggs and the chicken fingers with fries. (Chicken fingers and fries, best tasting food on our table- frozen premade foods).  Now, before you crunch up your face, get upset, and say \"these are just crappy customers with no sense of taste\".. I have been in culinary for 16 years. My fiance is currently in culinary. We both hold management position at two of the biggest hotel/casinos on the strip.   This is just my honest review of this place.",

    "text": "We were excited to see a breakfast place so close to home and decided to give it a try. The service was very friendly, but the food was just meh... Pancakes were ok, a little dense. Sausage links had seasoning like McDonalds, which I like, just not as rich, they were pretty good. Home style potatoes, just meh, not much flavor. Bacon,,, um, horrid. As in thin, bad buffet bacon. Flavor was just not good. Wife said the toilet in the bathroom had a ring. The place was pretty light on customers when we got there at about 9:30am on a Sunday morning, but seemed to pick up a little by the time we left. We really like to support the small local businesses, but this place needs to step up their game a bit. Their prices justify expectations of better quality food, ingredients.",

The tiny cup of $1 fruits (only a couple of slices of strawberries and banana), charged extra $1 for egg white only omelette. It was just a normal serving size food with jalapenos, turkey sausage, onions, tomatoes and cheese.   The first waitress with tattoos and facial piercings was kinda rude, she the one who took my order. I politely asked her when she get the chance to refill my water. She didn't even come by to refill my water or asked how I was doing until I was done writing up my cheque, and I had 3 or 4 different waiters throughout my time at the table and I'm wasn't even sure who was my waiter anymore.  This was my 2nd visit to this place and I don't think it is worth going back for the subpar service and expensive food that isn't best in town.",

My husband had the Nevadan skillet which he said was good as well. Our kids had the happy face pancake that was shaped like mickey mouse. The only complaint I have is that drinks are not included in the kids meal pricing and 1.99 per kids drink is a bit expensive or I would have probably given 5 stars. Will definitely come back and have the kiddos drink water next time lol.",

This water sure is good\" as they also waited for their food. The party outside gave back the menus saying that couldn't wait any longer. When the food finally arrived, I couldn't eat the pancake. It was difficult to cut. The skillet had very minimum salt.",

Actually we were the only ones there...   The service is great. Our server was so sweet and nice but the food was just terrible.   My friend and I both ordered the chicken and waffle entree after seeing photos on Yelp. The dish was unbearably salty.  I had to drench the chicken in syrup to take it down. The waffle was a bit chalky not fluffy or crispy like I expected.   I can't see myself coming back unless I wanted something simple like eggs and bacon and was too lazy to go to the store.",

I felt like I could cook the food myself and I'm not that good at cooking. There are some places where there's no way you can replicate the cooking of certain Dishes and have it taste as good.",

The staff are wonderfully efficient and sincerely friendly. I've never been disappointed by the food.  The dishes are huge and so yummy! The oatmeal is so pretty and tasty you forget you're being healthy.  My daughter loves the burger and fries here too!",

The griddle breakfast of vegetables,  potates, eggs and cheese was delicoous. The prices are moderate, the atmosphere is friendly. It's a small resturant but the staff is very accommodating.  I would recommend this place to anyone, I know I plan on going back again.",

    "text": "We came here based on good reviews and were very disappointed. I ordered the skillet griddle and the potatoes and mushrooms were undercooked. It took too long to get the food out (30 minutes) and we only ordered two entrees. While we waited for the underwhelming food, we weren't crazy about the service either. Besides the fact that no ome greets the front area for patrons coming in, we've witnessed the servers put clean eating utensils on a dirty table, realized the table needed to be cleaned, removed said utensils, wiped the table with questionable-looking dish rag, and then placing the exact same eating utensils back on the \"clean\" table. Griddle cakes definitely need improvement on these areas. On a positive note, their griddlecakes are quite good.",
