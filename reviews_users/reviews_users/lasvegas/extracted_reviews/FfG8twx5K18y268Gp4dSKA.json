Our server kept wandering off, our food took forever to come out, the wings were dry and not sauced. The only thing we really enjoyed this visit was the fried pickles.",

Mind you, my 7 month old daughter was asleep in her car seat. The Brunette that met us at the door grabbed two menus and proceeded to try to sit us in the outdoor/indoor patio. There's a cold breeze & she can clearly see that we have our child with us.  My husband asked if there was any where else that we could be seated. She said she could only sit us there. Really?   May I just say.... There were only people at the bar. There may have been one person that was watching TV in the main eating area, who could have possibly been a worker.   Where's the customer service? Where's the accommodation?",

We waited for 30mins after being seated.  Mind you, I just got off a 12hr shifts and I was starving! My husband went to the bar to ask if we could please order food.  He immediately took the initiative to take our orders and serve us drinks.  The entire time we were there he tended to the folks at the bar and then left the bar to take care of us even if he could've asked a waitress to tend to us.  He made us a priority which in my eyes is phenomenal. As busy as he was at the bar he made sure we were happy and satisfied. We will be coming again soon to see Tyler and experience his awesome service again. I work for a high end dealership and I know an exceptional customer service experience when I see it. Thank you again for the awesome service.  You turned around a not so great experience into building new regular customers.  Cheers.",

So three of us got up went to the bar and got our own drinks. When we came back the waitress still hadn't come by, so we moved to a more populated seating area. I ordered a Long Island Ice Tea and sent it back twice because of little to none alcohol in it. I understand the point of the drink is to not taste alcohol, however why did I taste only pineapple juice? The second time I had a rude guy come out and say \"you know you're not suppose to taste the alcohol right? I filled it almost all the way up no extra charge\" uhm okay?  Then the food came, it sucked. My medium boneless were definitely the mild butter ones. Gross.  $70 later and I was still hungry...  Very disappointing.",

Well, its kind of late now!  I was very pleasant with the server as she seemed genuinely concerned with the issue.   I have a few fries, yuck. Worst fries ever.  So soggy they might have been cooked in luke warm oil.   Still in an acceptable mood i pull the bun off my burger to add ketchup and mustard.  Imagine my surprise to find a lot of onions on my burger.  The server removed the burger from the check.  This is expected but the money is not the issue.   If i order a meal i expect it to arrive as ordered.  Yes, the cook missed the instructions but it is the responsibility of the server to verify it is right before delivering it to the customer.  Also, if an item is unavailable the customer should be informed before any substitutions are made. In this case i would have changed my entire order had i known the tots were unavailable.  This is not the first poor experience i have had at this place but it is certainly the last.   Good luck!  Twin Peaks has better service, better food, and better servers!",

Service was good, but the food was very slow to come out. The wings are a decent size, some of the franchisees use smaller wings.

    "text": "I have to say, I feel terribly disappointed. Tonight I called and ordered 20 breaded, medium buffalo wings and an order of fried pickles from Hooters. I drove the ~3 minutes to the restaurant, got my order, and headed home excited to enjoy some Hooters wing deliciousness.   When I got home first thing my wife and I tried were the pickles, which were soggy, and tasted doughy. Next I opened our container of wings, only to find that they were unsauced, and sitting in about 1/4 inch of oil.   I drove back and told the hostess my issues with the wings. She proceeded to state that they WERE sauced, but the mild and medium sauces were more of a buttery sauce. Now mind you, I fry food on a regular basis, and am a huge fan of wings. The oil at the bottom of my container had not even a small amount of vinegar or spice. I didn't want to argue in the middle of a crowded place. So I just ate my pride and asked for my order to be replaced with hot buffalo. A few minutes later she brought back my order, which were the original grease soaked wings re tossed in a mildly spicy excuse for buffalo sauce.   Now I sit, wallowing in the misery of a disappointing, over priced meal. On a whole I still love Hooters, but on this occasion I would have been better off picking up some wings from the wing bar at Albertsons down the street. I definitely don't recommend spending your money at this particular location.",

    "text": "1/21/16 930pm. We love your chicken wings and we came to your restaurant to splurge and enjoy your menu, there are 4 of us girls then. We were waiting for our husbands because they wanted to drink beer so we planned meet them there. Before we came to your restaurant we went to a coffee shop and had take out left overs, when we arrived at Hooters with our carry out drinks from th coffee place  (they are half way done by the way) they welcomed us and seated us, never questioning our drinks from outside. Then the waitress took our orders without and questions or concerns about the drinks we have, after the order was taken she comes back saying we can't have our drinks from outside in the restaurant so she suggested to just set it aside where no one can see it and we can enjoy it later when we leave, ok everybody happy. Then \"the manager on duty\" came and said that we can't have these drinks here . We are not even touching it and it's hidden on a chair at the corner.He gave us 2 options finish it outside when it's 40F or throw it, because it's their policy. He is very rude and narrow minded, gave us a dissatisfiing attitude and answers. He doesn't know how to compromise for customers satisfaction, does not know how to give reasonable options. Very disappointing. please educate your staff on how to be courteous and reasonable to customers. If he did not give us an attitude then we will not complain and we will obey right away. But he does not know how to provide a good customer service.",

BUT ALL THAT HAS CHANGED! Not sure if they have new management in, but the service has really stepped up, the wings are always hot and arrive quickly, and the waitresses are not just pretty faces anymore....they actually know how to serve and provide a smiling face to customers.  Go see Holly! She just relocated from the Hooters Casino and was fun, sassy, spunky, quick with our drinks and our food and a pleasure to be around.   Wanna try something new? Order wings tossed in 911 first, then coated in lemon pepper. Yummy. Best ordered naked to get all the flavor out of it. Sooooo goood.",

She has always been so attentive and made me feel so at home at this bar- more than any other in this neighborhood since I bought my house several years ago here. Her customer service is over the top! But she was not there. When I asked the bartender she replied that she was not here tonight and when I further inquired I was told that she \"Would not be here.\" I find it very disturbing that a bar would let go a bartender that I know is loved by myself and so many other patrons in this area. If Hooters new what was best for them they would BEG this DIAMOND back to their establishment.",

The bill came and there were charges for cheese on the bill and charges for the syrup in the flavored lemonade.   The menu doesnt say nor did the waitress note that the flavored part of the drink would be an extra $2 nor did she mention that the burger doesnt come with cheese, its extra!   She showed us on the menu in the teeniest print where it says, extra cheese $1.99...Yes, but we didnt order extra cheese, just cheese.    Well thats extra we were told.   She left with the bill and did take the charges for the extra cheese off.    They need to change the menu and they need to warn the customers of extra charges, flavored iced tea $2.99 flavored-is extra cost, or something, not throw a surprise charge in there!  The girls did take a photo with me and my baby hooter owl when we left so that was a plus! He got a mouthful...I mean he got comfortable, thats what I mean, Yes...

When we were seated, the menus looked like they were put through a storm and were gross and sticky.... It took forever for our waitress to come over and take our drink order, so long that we had already figured out what we wanted to eat AND what we wanted to eat as an appetizer ...   We got our appetizer, Buffalo Chicken Dip which was EXCELLENT and I highly recommend it. We needed a refill on drinks and and finished the appetizer before she even came back to check on us. Our waitress, Arielle, didn't even come back and make sure everything came out okay and see if we needed anything else.    The next time we saw our waitress, she was brining us our food.  She finally got us refills and checked to see if the food came out okay, and then she disappeared again.  The food was excellent and cooked to perfection, hence the 2 stars. She came back soon after to let us know she was leaving and someone else would take over and then ran off before we could tip her, which honestly wouldn't be much since she obviously didn't care about us or the tip. The next waitress was better, but still didn't care to make sure we were taken care of, when we were one of two groups in the ENTIRE place...   All the other Hooter's I have ever been to , the girls are ALWAYS attentive, bring refills before you are done with your first round, they talk to you and check on you and make you feel welcome, even when its a crowded fight night. THIS Hooters made you feel like you weren't welcome and that we would have been treated better at McDonalds....   I used the bathroom before we left and boy I should have used a truck stop bathroom.... Every time I went to get toilet paper, the ENTIRE toilet paper holder would FALL on me........ How did it fall on me since it's against the wall you ask??? The entire front part would fall open and its heavy and hurt terribly and since the stall is extremely small, you can't avoid getting hit.... The bathroom looked like Hellen Keller tiled it and put it all together... The plumbing is terrible and can't even flush the toilet to get a small wad of paper down the hole..   I will NOT be back , which really makes me sad considering how much I enjoy their food....",

Dear Caitlyn, You are a rude ass C***. You were too lazy to get yourself off your stool to seat us, and when you did you walked over to the table without even acknowledging us, so that is why we did not follow you. A nice \"follow me this way\" would have been appreciated. We both know you use your mouth from the looks of it.. instead of using it for God knows what, use your words. But no she used her head and pointed it toward us then the table. So, we walked over to the table to meet you, and you greeted us with our menu's and a nice rolling of your eyes. Great touch, hooters had taught you well.   Dear Hooters, Caitlyn, needs to be fired, or retrained. I was really looking forward to the wings and the beer and I got neither. Instead I got a rude awakening of what your restaurant has to offer. I will never be coming back.  Side note, I was with my friend, her family which included her dad, her husband and her two kids under 10. We would have ordered a lot and tipped well. Your loss. If you guys see Caitlyn, I hope you get a better experience than we did!",

If you've been to any Hooters location before, you know you come for the girls, wings and beer. Everything else on the menu is meh. Service here is mediocre too and even worse if you come when it's busy like during lunch rush or a night where they're running a special...then all service goes out the door.  I've always loved the breaded \"hot\" wings which are not really too hot - good, because I'm not a big spicy food eater. I recently discovered Daytona style wings here and it has become my new favorite! Daytona style is their non-breaded, or \"naked\" wings, that are sauced and then finished on the grill. Costs $1 more per order but it's well worth it because it has a lot more flavor.  Surprisingly it doesn't get too crowded here on game nights, unless it's something major like March Madness. As long as they're not also running some kind of BOGO or AYCE special then it's a pretty quiet place to chill and watch sports.",

I would place an order and it would say, \"confirming order\" on the Uber eats app. I've ordered food many times on Uber eats and usually it takes 3 min or less for them to confirm order, but here at this hooters they take 10 min \"confirming order\" then later says it's been cancelled or could not be processed, thanks for wasting my time when I could've ordered something else instead of waiting for 10 min for nothing. I ordered from McDonald's and they couldn't process our orders before because of some issues with their fryer or ice cream machine, but professionally, they call my phone saying they couldn't process it and said if there is anything else I would like. That's all I want from hooters! A simple call back would be nice saying we can't make the food you placed an order for and apologize for the inconvenience. Either the staff neglects the Uber eats orders or they got some lazy staff in there. Because I know for a fact if I had called and placed an order for pick up, they would've done my order but I don't get why it's different when ordering on the Uber eats app?",

    "text": "Regular customer, typically order 40 wings on the weekends, no problems $54 + tip. Call on a Tuesday to order my usual order. Bonus! It's BOGO night. (Buy one get one free). I order my usual order, $29. Sweet! Get the wings and they're TINY! Literally HALF the size as normal during the week. And because they're smaller than the typical weekly wings and the cooks cook them for the same time, they were over cooked and dried out and cold. I call to ask if they manipulate the size of the wings for BOGO night. Speak to the manager. Not trying to complain or get a free hand out, just want to know so if I order wings I can ask for the \"weekly\" size wings not the \"BOGO\" size wings. I'll PAY THE EXTRA $! Just give me what I pay for. Instead, the manager and front desk person HANGS UP ON ME! Not once, FIVE TIMES!!! Well they couldn't hang up on me when I showed up and made a scene. So let it be known, a) Hooters manipulates the wing sizes for BOGO night, so your not getting any special deal. Sysco sells wings in about 10 sizes. B) Hooters doesn't give a shit about regular customers that are willing to spend $54 + tip for wings you can get anyplace else for $20. C) they employ incompetent management and staff that are clueless on how to conduct business!",

    "text": "First Hooters experience. Sure were a lot of boobs around the building, but sorry girls, your sets do not compare one of the girls in my party of 3. :)  All boobs aside, since I was a first timer, my girlfriends gave me a brief crash course of the menu and some recommendations. We started off with fried pickles for appetizers and 20 piece boneless chicken. Not knowing what kind of seasoning we want for our chicken, our Hooters girl was chill enough to allow us to do half and half on certain flavors to explore around. She recommended the Honey Thai seasoning and we chose the Cajun to seal the deal.  Our fried pickles came out, fresh out of the fryer, and we dove right in. Too bad they only gave out one dinky cup of dipping sauce, which completely ran out halfway into our appetizer. They charge extra for extra sauce (oh come on, really?), but we still went ahead and requested some more. Our boneless chicken finally came and I like how each flavors were served in separate plates. The Cajun was spicy, yet tolerable, and indeed SALTY! I suppose that's how Cajun seasoning is supposed to be, but it was alright. The Honey Thai, recommended by our Hooters girl, was probably my favorite. It's sweet, with a hint of spiciness. I would like it if the spiciness was kicked up another notch, but our Cajun wings already covered that department, so it was all good. They were also a bit salty.  Overall, it was a nice and SALTY experience. I think I chugged down 3 cups of water throughout the meal. Our Hooters girl was also nice enough to split our check three ways. She definitely got a nice tip from all of us.  I want to give it 3.5, but had to round up because of the accommodating staff and clean atmosphere.

Other locations have done this for me before so I didn't think it was going to be an issue. When I called to place my order, I asked for the Fried chicken salad, and stated that I wanted my chicken tossed in buffalo sauce. The girl on the phone told me that I couldn't do that, but that they have a buffalo chicken salad. I specified that I didn't want the ingredients in the buffalo salad, and preferred the fried chicken salad but with my chicken spicy. Again I was told that I couldn't do that. So I resolved to order the fried chicken salad but with the chicken normal. Ok whatever.  Note to hooters: when your guest asks for something that can be done, do it. Its a way to get repeat business. Not to mention when I tried to call again to place a to go order, no one answered the phone. Twice. I mean really?  My vote: Skip it. Or at least try another location where they pretend to actually care for the needs of the customer.",

We saw her again to order order our food. Which she did not even do right. When we got our food. there were no plates, I actually had to ask, for a plate and my extras which I had said in the beginning, when she took the order. The wings that I ordered were kinda dry and warm not even hot considering that she didn't  have but 2 tables. There has never been a hooters that has not gave you plate before your wings arrived. So in the end, she gave me the bill, which we had to wait another 15 Mins for her to even pick it up.By this time my daughter and I were the only table. We were looking for anyone to help at this point. She finally came over took our bill. I wanted to leave no tip since I got 1 refill in a hour, the wings were dry and the service was horrible. But I did anyway, since she called my daughter a princess. I think that was the only positive thing that happened at hooters.",

I don't expect 5 star food but I at least expect 4 star service. I have attempted this location a total of three times now. First time was decent, I give you that. The last two times were offensive. The Daytona wings I ordered at 12pm showed up at 12:50. I could understand if the kitchen was backed up but there were only 3 people there. The server completely forgot about our food so when it arrived the fries were cold and the wings were incredibly soggy. The response I was given was \"well that is how they always are.\" Really? At least apologize for the mistake. Nothing was even taken off our bill even though I sent them back! The last time I dined here (hoping they just had a (bad day) was even WORSE service. The girl behind the bar was wearing a black shirt and jeans because she said she was a supervisor. I was there with one of my girlfriends and we were completely ignored. Our food order took 30mins to get in because she was busy chatting with the girls starting their shifts. Once our food was eaten and we were ready for our bill, we asked politely and got it instantly. Unfortunately, it took another 15mins for her to run the card! Complete and utter disrespect. Hooters guidelines state to always serve women and children first. This supervisor was more interested in the latest gossip than a good experience. Hope you guys can weed out the bad at this location. Until then, I'll stick to Buffalo Wild Wings or Twin Peaks.",

We had the giant wing platter which is 50pcs for 41.20 and was able to order it 1/2 with breading and 1/2 \"naked\" (without the breading)   The wings took awhile to come out but they just tasted a little different from the hooters casino.   The breaded wings weren't as breaded as they are in the hooters casino.   The smoking area was kind of a turn-off because thats where the bar is and where they serve food. Really gross.",

The \"french roll\" was so old that it crumbled to pieces the moment I picked it up.  I though I'd be able to just pick out & eat the shrimp but it had been fried to rubber.  This place is garbage.",

    "text": "I came in with my boyfriend to watch a game tonight and we were seated just inside of the patio area. The garage door leading out to the patio was open, as the weather's been nice lately. I observed several people smoking at the bar, (maybe 4 yards from our table) as well as behind us on the patio. Me, being a smoker, I asked our server, Jasmine, if I was allowed to smoke in the area we were seated. She told me she would ask a manager just to be sure and said she would bring me an ashtray if smoking was permitted. She promptly returned with the ashtray for me, and before I could even fully light my cigarette, I was approached by a man who told me I was not allowed to smoke. I said, \"I just asked my server and she said she would check with a manager and they said it was fine.\" His response is the reason for my review and 2 star rating. In a condescending tone he replied, \"Well, I'm one of the managers, so...\" and walked off. Being a manager in retail, I found his response unprofessional, and ultimately rude. I moved outside to avoid conflict. My boyfriend had just gotten back from the bathroom after the incident occurred and naturally, I told him how I was approached and spoken to by the manager. It's not like I put up my dukes to sock it out with the guy over a cigarette, but the tone he used just rubbed me the wrong way. Long story short, (too late) my boyfriend alerted our server and she apologized multiple times before and after she went out of her way to DOUBLE CHECK with the GM who,( you guessed it) said smoking was indeed permitted where we were seated. Our food was great, my beer was cold, our server was polite and apologetic even though she was not at fault, but this other manager is the reason for making my night just slightly less enjoyable. Three words: Customer. Service. Bro.",

    "text": "We have driven by this location many times, but had kids with us, so never went inside. We decided Saturday it was time to check it out. Wow, the food was over priced and horrible. We complained about it all! Our waitress was very understanding, and tried to accommodate us. But we just kept getting irritated a little more after each item. First was our table. We walked up to the hostess desk, and she told us to seat ourselves. After walking to three different tables, we tried cleaning the less messy one, to get irritated and walked back to the hostess. When we told her all three tables were dirty and needed to be cleaned, she coped an attitude and gently touched one for us. It was still sticky that we had to ask for a towel and wipe it down again. At this point I was ready to leave, but the people with me calmed me down a bit. We started our order with pretzels and beer cheese. The \"bread\" was not a pretzel and hard/burnt/over cooked, and the beer cheese was so loaded with green onions, all you tasted was onions. When we called the waitress over, she apologized and said they have been getting a lot of complaints tonight. Really? So fix it! Then one of us ordered 6 wings in a hot sauce of some kind. The \"wings\" came out like little bites, not wings, and with the wrong sauce. This friend didn't complain, so I did. The waitress apologized and said, those were their wings. How can you been known for wings, and don't serve proper wings with the sauce ordered? I personally ordered a plain grilled chicken sandwich. When I bit into it, there was so much hot seasoning, I couldn't eat it. When I called the waitress over and told her it wasn't a plain sandwich, she said, \"oh yea, we season all our chicken breasts.\" Well, why didn't you say that when I ordered? Someone ordered a raspberry tea, and when we got the bill, there was a charge for a tea, and another charge for raspberry syrup. Really? The cost of that horrible meal was way too expensive for what we actually ate versus ordered. Needless to say, we left incredibly disappointed, and had to get dinner elsewhere. What a waste of two checks!! There are so many other awesome places to eat in this town, stay away from Hooters!",

    "text": "I usually love this place but the last few times I visited this establishment I was severely disappointed. I am a close neighborhood gaming/restaurant bartender and I recently moved areas but my best friend lives across the road of Hooters so I have recommended coming here since I live their special non-breaded wings but I ordered a Cadillac Margarita and tasted only sweet & sour. I didn't see her put the Gran Marnier so I asked how she made it. It's one of their signature cocktails and her answer was \"oh I don't know let me look for it\". Wow ok so I'm paying $10 for an incorrect drink. Sorry I'm a stickler on margaritas because my standards are high as a Vegas bartender.   The second time I decided to give them another try because I love the graveyard bartender but I cannot come in during that time so we had lunch and the young girl server had 3 tables. Our 2 top, another 2 top, and 3 top. I've ran a full bar and 4 tables all by myself and she couldn't even serve us in a timely manner whatsoever. I saw a manager I've never seen before just running food and the girls dripped a ranch trail all over the floor, then she took 15 after she brought our water to ask if we wanted a DRINK. We got 2 specialty drinks which with 8 ppl at the gaming bar, I'm shocked it took her that long for those. She arrived & as she placed the drinks down she mumbled \"that was an ordeal\". Wow, so she put in our food order and then when she dropped the check it took her almost 20 min to come get the $, & she came by with mouth FULL OF FOOD which explains why it took her so long to pick up our $ and said \"I'll be right back with your change\".   Seriously, finish your food before you touch a table. It's just unprofessional and unsanitary that I no longer want to eat or drink there. I'm very taken back how the service is there. I worked in that neighborhood for 3 years and I worked so hard to accommodate guests & it just frustrates me when I see people not respect their jobs or customers. With so many bars & restaurants opening, I would be very picky on who I hire and as a manager, touch the waitresses tables to ensure their guests are satisfied. It just seems like common sense. What a disappointment.",

As usual, the food is not bad and no matter which Hooters I went to and I have been to many different states and different countries to eat at Hooters, the food is predictably the same.  However, today was the nadir of my history of eating at Hooters.    Today there was a preseason NFL game on and the volume of the televisions was so loud my ears were ringing because of the high volume.  I could not hear my son speak.  I could not hear the waitress speak.  It was horrible.  The manager came over and told me he could \"dim\" the sound but he had to keep the volume up.  I said why, it was uncomfortably loud.   He said I should have not choose to sit under the speaker on the wall near the ceiling.  I said I choose to leave.  He graciously gave me my food order without charging me after I changed my order to go.    Regardless, if you want to lose your hearing or walk around with your ears buzzing even after you leave the building, this is not a bad place.  For those that are deaf, you should enjoy.  For those that want to preserve their hearing,  I would totally avoid this location.    Try BWW instead.",

We came in and were ignored for 10 minutes and when we wanted machines side by side \"none\" were available.  Which was a lie because people weren't playing. As we sat at the bar it took 25 minutes to order food. Tyler ignored us basically the whole night. We were there for 1.5 hours. We played $60 poker and keno. Long story short I confronted him when paying our bill and he told me that of course he would ignore us over his family we are nobody. He tried to take my bill before I signed it, took MY copies and crumbled them and tried to throw them away and told me I am sorry you didn't get anything for free.  This guy needs to be fired. I will never return and I hope no one has to deal with this guy.  Who talks to people like that. I don't need his free stuff but I am pretty sure that if you play a certain amount your drinks or at least one is free.   The only good thing about this place is the food!!! Amazing.",

This experience wasn't much better. We sat at a booth and the speakers were up so loud playing the football game right above our table. It was so obnoxious.   I ordered the boneless wings hot and it came out smothered in thick sauce. Just like how they do it at Buffalo Wild Wings, which I do not like at all. The original hooters recipe that you find at everyother hooters is what I was looking forward to. This was so gross.   Also, the bathroom and the hallway to the bathroom smells so bad. Like mildew and feces or something.   I love hooters but this is the worst one I have ever been to.",

My server Breea was fantastic.  She took the time to explain to her favorites on the menu: fried pickles and the new smoked wings.   I loved the smoked wings - they use a real smoker machine (rather than smoke flavor) and the meat was tender and juicy.  100% delicious.  The fried pickles were a bit soggy and didn't have enough \"bite\".  The -1 star is for cleanliness.  The first TWO tables I sat at were visibly dirty and the server was embraced by it.  The menus were fairly beat up.",

We walked in not one person greeted us we kind of just stood there for about 2 minutes then finally one of the girls comes up asks if we want a booth or table we say booth and she said okay wait while we clean it. Then when it's done she tells us go ahead and walk over there so we did she brought our menus about a minute later. Then our waitress came she was very friendly if it wasn't for her I'd give the place no stars. She took our drink orders came back with the drinks which were awful I got a strawberry margarita and wow was it sweet almost not drinkable. After that drink I just ordered water cause it was so bad. Our food came out in a timely matter we didn't wait to long we got some boneless wings to share and I ordered there burger melt. The food wasn't bad it also wasn't amazing its just like normal diner food I'd say.. really nothing special. Our bill came out to $130 do I think it was worth it absolutely not way to over priced. And just the rudeness of the staff alone would make me never go back.",

Fine just fix the receipt walk over where the manager is and he's telling another employee I'm tripping! Really I've sat here an additional 30 minutes because my bill was messed up!

    "text": "Okay, if I'm being real... the food is slightly better than what you'd expect at a bar. If you were to envision a line you'd set for expectancy of quality of food in a bar where their selling point is suggestive body exposure, they exceed the line by a little bit, which was a pleasant surprise. Kudos to them.  Now for the rough part... I have went twice during UFC fights where they now charge $20 for cover charge. LITERALLY just as much as other local counterparts in beautiful, elegant, and hospitable Station Casinos. If you can get past wildly overcharging a cover based on the atmosphere they provide, it gets worse. They sent me out and refused business because I tried to pay my cover with a card. I was actually willing to pay the absurd cover just because I wanted to watch the event that bad and tried to solution find with the manager on duty saying you can charge my card directly 20 on my bill as I was planning to order food anyway and to my dismay, they literally refused me. The actual manager on duty literally asked me to drive away to my bank to pull $20 cash out and come back. I was floored.  There are much better places for sports so I haven't been back since then until yesterday. I thought \"no cover today, cross your fingers and hope for a better time\" and I was let down again. The server last night was nice... when she was around. Which, was nearly never. I had to physically get up out of my seat to track her (or anyone down) as we had not been checked up on to find 4 hooters girls having a pow wow by the kitchen not attending anyone. Me (being me) tried to watch activity patterns after that and noticed we weren't the only ones affected by it. No one was being attended. And that same pony tailed manager was on duty who refused my card for the UFC fight and didn't seem to notice or care what his staff was (or literally was not) doing. I think this location is very, very poorly managed, and customer service seems to be at the bottom of their priority list.   Don't bother.",

I have always preferred Wingstop among others but last night we were at Grimaldi's to pick up a free birthday pizza and hubby wanted wings so we decided on Hooters out of convenience since it was only two doors down. I haven't had Hooters in more than 7 years and now I remember why. Although I don't ever remember it being that bad, maybe because back then I didn't know any better since I'm really not that big into wings.  We ordered 20 pieces ($22 with tax), 10 pieces original wings with garlic parmesan sauce on the side and 10 pieces lemon pepper, comes with 2 ranch dressing. That had to be the most ordinary wings I've ever had! The original wings were tasteless and just plain boring! I decided to get the sauce on the side just in case we didn't like it (which was nasty by the way), but the original breading itself was bland, no salt and pepper detected just flour. The lemon pepper wings had little taste but it was undesirable, at least in comparison with Wingstop's lemon pepper which are pretty hard to beat.  Needless to say, I won't be back. That was the worst $20 I've spent, should have gone with my instinct and gotten Wingstop instead or just made some myself because not to toot my own horn but I make some wicked wings, according to my husband anyway ;)",

Our bartender was very nice and friendly, but after ordering drinks with water, our water cups had trash inside.  I was so disgusted with the cup, that we just canceled our order and order food elsewhere. If our water cups were dirty with trash floating at the top, then I can only imagine how the kitchen looks.",

Anyway, I've been to Hooters before and used to love it for the cheap grilled cheese on the menu and inexpensive beer.  Hadn't been for a while and they took the grilled cheese with tomato off the menu.  Sad times.  I asked for it and the woman said that grilled cheese was only on the kids menu now and not available for adults.  I asked her if I could just have a plain grilled cheese for the \"adult\" price.  When I got it, it was a normal grilled cheese with a children's portion of fries.  The receipt showed a \"ham and cheese sandwich\" meal, which was the same price as my husband's burger.  Seriously?  This is their solution to grilled cheese not being on the menu anymore?  I should not have been charged the same price as a burger meal for a grilled cheese and children's portion of french fries.  I would have brought this up but my husband had to get back to work, so I let it go.  Will not go back.",

They were to busy drinking with the regulars to help anyone else.  It looked like the manager was drinking along with them.  We were not off in a corner where they could not see us we were one table away from the bar.   Don't waste your money in a place that can't be bothered with the  customer who is not buying the waitress drinks.",

    "text": "I was in town for someone's birthday, and she wanted to go to Hooters.  So, I said, \"Chicken wings?  Why not?\"  The hostess, though visibly taken aback by the request for seating for 15 people, was glad to accommodate us and enlisted some of her orange-shorted compatriots to move tables together.  The service was fantastic.  Our waitresses were always around, always filling our drink orders, and always getting us whatever we needed.  Our food came out quickly, and our main waitress showed no negative signs of having to deal with such a large party.  I ordered the Wingsday platter--10 boneless chicken wings, french fries, and a choice of ranch or blue cheese dressing.  My specifications were hot wings, sub tots for the fries, and ranch.  Unfortunately, my wings were not hot, and I was ready to sweat that night!  The tater tots were bland and made me regret not getting the fries.  On the plus side, there was plenty of ranch dressing, more than I wanted.  Though the food was just all right, the time spent with family and friends and the friendly waitstaff made this a good experience.",

This hot sauce had no flavor, it's so bland that I thought they didn't sauce my wings and I ordered extra for dipping...it was just no good. The chicken itself tasted weird...and I'm a wing lover so I know what chicken wing meat taste like when it's old, it tasted old and dirty like it hadn't been rinsed before frying...it was pretty bad. Service is cool though...the best location in the Vegas area is in sunset station in Henderson, it worth the drive...plus they have 20 wings and a pitcher for 20 bucks!!!",

For some reason, after this our waitress brought our next round in 12 oz plastic cups. We were ready to have a good time that night and so we requested our drinks be brought in the larger pint size. She shrugged and said she couldn't do that, the smaller plastic cups were all she had. I was okay with that, until I saw her bring the table next to us some beers in 16 oz pint glasses (not plastic!). We then requested the same glass as they had, but she then told us her manager wouldn't let her use glass because they had to wash them - it's a restaurant and bar, OF COURSE there will be dishes to wash!   After this, we ordered several more rounds, all brought in 12 oz plastic cups while I watched her bring 16 oz glasses to several tables around us. I honestly have no idea why this occurred, but it made me pretty annoyed.   The food was okay - very fried and greasy but exactly what I would expect from a Hooters.  When the bill came, we were charged a full pint on every 12 oz drink we had (I know, because it clearly said \"PINT - STELLA\" and whatnot on each line of the receipt). We brought this up to the waitress, who acknowledged they weren't pints, shrugged, and said she couldn't do anything about it and we had to pay full price for each drink. This was one of the only times in my life I have left a tip under 15%, but I couldn't reward that woman's dismissive and rude behavior.",

I am honestly sad for whomever calls themselves a cook and allows that to leave the kitchen.

They are all the same to me: average food and slow service. But I get it, this is a place to watch sports, hang out with friends and have a good time. (Hey, it's different for those of us who don't drink alcohol :P)  Our server was polite and friendly. She got us our drinks quickly after we sat down and took our food order not too long after that. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. Our food took like 35-40 minutes to come out. Really?? It wasn't a full house at all. There were 2 other tables that were occupied and a bunch of people sitting at the bar. During that time, our waitress disappeared as well. We had to flag her down just to get us our drink refills. Ugh, why is service always so damn slow at Hooters?? It also sucks when you are super hungry!  I have always enjoyed their Lots-A-Tots (without the chives). Tater tots with cheese, sour cream and bacon, how can you go wrong? Other than that, I have never really found anything I liked on the menu. From what I remember, the wings made me feel sick, and the BBQ pulled pork sandwich was bland and soggy (although that was years ago in California). I kept it simple and ordered the burger sliders. They were pretty tasty, but the meat patties were much smaller than the buns that they used. My husband on the other hand, likes just about anything on the menu.   Other than the awesome Lots-A-Tots, there were a few other positive things about this place. The restaurant was very clean, they leave wet naps for you on the table (hey, most places you have to ask), and the manager was walking around asking everyone how they were doing. Seriously, he stopped by our table 3 times to check up on us. He also processed our payment at the end since our waitress never came back.   Not a place I would visit again, but if I do, let's just hope I'm not starving again!",

When I first walked in Kylie was the first face I seen as she was drawn into the phone like nobody else existed right away, I was already annoyed with the service I was receiving. Then Lily I believe her name was walked around the corner while giving off a dirty look like she hates her job. At that point I sat at my table located in front of the hostess stand and was greeted by my Amazing server Laura. If it wasn't for my amazing server I would have left right after getting those awful vibes. As I was waiting on my food, I continued to watch Kylie who I believe is the hostess was STILL glued to her phone. Working in the Food and Beverage industry and being a hostess myself I was beyond shocked that being upfront, how into her phone she was.",

    "text": "I went to this Hooters location last night to watch UFC 119 with friends. The first minute I walked through the door I was informed impolitely that there would be a 10$ charge to watch this fights, which was to be expected. At that point I was slightly annoyed due to being treated like an object of only monetary value. Afterwards I had a seat in the bar area with friends. I sat for 30 minutes without being asked if I needed anything. Eventually another friend showed up and sat down. At that point a waitress finally came over, took his drink order, and then practically tried to run away from the table. I literally had to call her out and ask for water and to place my meal order. This waitress did not make eye contact nor was she even slightly friendly. Mind you, it was only 5pm and the restaurant was maybe only 25-30% full with an obvious ample staff of employees. I then ordered wings, which arrived warm, not hot; at this point I was seriously annoyed; they had done everything wrong at this since I stepped through the door. From there on out we were hardly attended to by an impatient waitress who had less enthusiasm than a nun. Also, nobody came to pick up any of our used plates on the table. The place is obviously managed by an apathetic slacker because their employees were some of the worst I've ever encountered. Will I be back? What do you guys think :)",

I can also recommend their boneless as they are delicious with the perfect amount of breaking.  I heard they make their sauces in house DAILY so your sauce preference can slightly vary each time you go.  I always get the same thing- breaded wings hot with curly fries and cheese sauce with fried pickles.  Definitely my favorite wing place. On Tuesday they have a wing special that everyone should check out.",

When we got home we realized my food was not included. Apparently the $28 we spent only covered tots, sliders and the beer and soda we had while we waited. So we called repeatedly to ask what happened and nobody answers at night apparently. We went back to the restaurant and the bartender claimed he didn't hear my order. So we paid, again, and waited some more. Not interested in going back to this location.",

I never understood why places like this stay open. I guess the history around Hooters is responsible.  With the waitress in skimpy outfits I assume this is what keeps the company afloat.

The 3 stars is due to cleanliness and speed of food delivery.   Walked in, greeted, and seated right away. The table had some crumbs, but the waitress apologized and cleaned it promptly. The menus were a different problem though - they were sticky and gooey. Gross! But we put in our drink and food orders right away and waited. Drinks came rather fast, but the food took some time. There were maybe a total of 10 people in the restaurant (with our party being 4). I'm a patient person, but the place was empty and we did not even order a ridiculous amount of wings. Not sure what the hold up in the kitchen was, but we waited a good 30 minutes sippin' on some water.   BUT! When the food did come out, it was really good. I don't come here for the waitresses - I come for the wangs! They are a good size, well-cooked, and not over nor under sauced.  You can't really complain about a good chicken wing with a side of sports. However, you can complain about dirty menus and relatively slow food. Not impressed, but not unimpressed enough not to come back because their wings are damn good.",

The lighting was super bright and the stools at the table were very uncomfortable, plus the TV I was facing did not work properly. So we decided to sit somewhere else, the tv in that area worked, the lighting was much better but then it was too cold, the fans were blasting and since my server was no where to be found I couldn't tell her about it. We didn't wait too long for the food but the server who delivered our food (not the assigned server)  just took off, we didn't have any utensils and I wanted to ask for an extra item. We had to flag down the host to help us out.   The chicken taco salad I got was ok, we were surprised to find out that pitchers of modelo were $25 (holy moly) and shots were $10.50! Might as well have gone to the strip for those prices.   I watched the fight uncomfortably and was glad it was over so I could finally warm up.",

Maybe the cook/cooks was having a tough day. The wings was either fried twice or they was left to cook for an extra 20 minutes,dry as hell no moisture at all. they were rock hard almost inedible. the doggy bag was truly for the doggies. we also ordered onion rings another mistake. we haven't eaten at Hooters in awhile and it just might be a long while before we try it again. Next time we want wings it will be The Chicken Shack in Henderson, which was my wife's first choice. Looking back at the situation we should have sent them back to the cook they were that bad.",

That being said I do like eating here as the wings are top notch for a franchise trying to satisfy the masses.  I've eaten here a few times and today the wait staff finally hit all the things you would expect from a Hooters girl. Hot, Hot and Damn Hot.   Only disappointment was when I asked for a TV to be changed to the Cubs game I was told sure right away. 20mins later as I was paying our bill the TV was still on the motocross event that not a soul was watching. (We were one of three tables in our section and that TV wasn't visible to anyone outside of our table so it could have been changed to WGN to satisfy a Cubs fan).  Our food was delicious, the fried pickles seemed weak on their own but the sauce that came with them turned them into a OMG appetizer.  We will be back the next time I want/need something hot & spicy to eat.",

So I called them and talked to the manager, I think his name is Eric(the one w the long black hair). I called them at exactly 1:50pm and told me that they're gonna give me another set of chx wings in about 10 mins. I gave them time I left my house at 2pm got there 2:10pm and told me to wait another 5 mins. 5 mins has passed became 10 then 20mins he just handed me the order and didn't even smile and didn't even apologize. Actually even the hostess Sabrina, cant actually remember the name but I know it starts with an S, who answered the phone even gave me attitude and said maybe I didn't pay for the extra dressing then I told her I did ! And she couldn't say anything more. I've been ordering to-gos at this location ever since but this is the baddest service i've had ! I wish I could even give them less than 1 star.",

It was a mistake, gave me a bellyache. 2 of the other guys had stomach issues also. Well we got mild (are very mild) boneless wings, they were okay, a little greasy. And deep fried pickles, also okay, need to be crispier but tasty...their pickles, how bad can they be. The extra charge for blue cheese and ranch is lame. I should've ran across the street to Albertsons and bought a bottle for about the same price. Our waitress did a good job but the guys agreed the eyecandy in this location is wasn't worth the heartburn, and 2 of them went outside to hit on girls that weren't Hooters waitresses. The drinks were good so I'd probably just go back for that, eh who am I kidding, I'll  give it one more chance? or will I??",

    "text": "No, we didn't get chicken wings for dinner, which is what they're normally big on besides the hot chicks. We opted for a sandwich and a hot dog instead.  I guess it was alright. I was more excited about their free wi-fi than anything .. oh and my blackened mahi sandwich. We also ordered the fried pickles, only because the menu had a warning saying it would be addicting. Really, it wasn't. It was lightly battered and served with thousand island which made it more sour. Probably would've been better with ranch? Maybe, but def not with the thousand island. Like I said the mahi was good--it was moist and very decent in size and was only 9 bucks. My bf got the big dog combo with a side of curly fries. I must say, these curly fries were \"naked.\" I'm used to eating seasoned curly fries so I wasn't a fan of these. The cheese sauce we dipped it in was also real salty. As far as the hot dog goes, the guy said \"everything is real salty\" but the portion was pretty big. The prices are reasonable as well, we only paid 24 bucks including tip.  Service was good, the waitress was real friendly. The place is pretty small and not only were there good looking chicks, but also a lot of good looking dudes. Definitely a good place to hang out with the friends, watch sports, and drink.",

    "text": "For some reason, I've never been a big Hooters fan. I just never thought their wings were all that great. Yeah I know. Wings are probably not the reason people go to Hooters.  Anyway, my cousins wanted to eat at a Hooters last weekend and this one happens to be the closest to their house. It is also the newest location and by virtue, the nicest. Coincidentally, the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl was going on at the same time. I'm happy to say that Hooters fought our hunger quite well that night.  I went with their Chicken Cobb Salad ($8.95). It's a great portion and filled me up. Granted, it's not the healthiest salad in the world with all that breaded and fried chicken and all that bacon. But then again, I'm not the healthiest eater in the world either. Bottom line: it was delicious.  I guess no Hooters review would be complete without mentioning the girls. Yes they were hot and distracting. But I have to give it up to the one who greeted us upon entry (I didn't get her name). When we came in, all of the screens were showing the bowl game. My cousin wanted to watch the rest of the Laker game. She stood there for what seemed like ten minutes trying to find the channel. Little customer service things like that make a huge difference in my opinion. For that simple reason, I give them a solid four stars.",

The staff is much more down-to-earth than most Hooters, and there are males as well as females.  Management always stops by to check on your level of happiness.  My favorite detail is that the room is split in half by a partial wall, with smoking/video poker on one side and non-smoking, no gaming on the other--there's also a patio.  It's always good when everyone can get the environment they seek.  As for us  vegetarians, we're stuck with fries, fried pickles (YUM!!) and salad.

I am from the east coast- I enjoy hooters ironically enough I was at MGM next to the hooters casino - I live in Summerlin, and thought I would drive out to spring valley to an actual restaurant.   I sat in the gaming area of the bar and it was dead needless to say it was 1130. Anyways - I go in sit down greeted by a nice BT I think her name was tosha or something with a t - she had blond hair- she greeted me I told her I was going to play and I ordered a beer. I noticed there were two guys in there along with myself - and a drunk guy that left pretty quickly - these two drunk guys were playing all the games and winning which was cool- and the bar tender seemed to be in it - the two guys that were winning were getting louder then they came over to my side of the bar - they were using every vulgarity you could use- but not in the half way bar acceptable use of the terms - they were using phrases and terms that you would hear on workaholics but 10x worse. Anything involving a woman - and her anatomy and what goes with that- purely disgusting. Mind you I came to eat. What really shocked me - he had a black hooters shirt on- he was a manager or something! Def FOH. I don't have a problem with drinking after work but he ruined my appetite and granted I put 200 in the machine I didn't get one comp for two beers and a chicken sandwich. Thirty bucks for all that after I played 200 worth of BJ- and listening to the manager talk to his drunk friend while his gf (the bar tender) was sticking money into the machine - GO TO TWIN PEAKS SO MUCH BETTER - hooters is great but this one sucked - and the bar tender should be embarassed of her boyfriend and manager and frankly herself-   Understand I'm not a prude I drink like a fish and I swear like the catholic I am. However, that was by far the worse experience I have ever had- I have no sympathy that hooters  is losing to twin peaks. They should be",

Looking around we saw 3 bartenders behind the bar: 1 was on his phone and the other 2 chatting it up with others around the bar. I'm totally cool with them talking to their guests to create and experience and the attempt to make a good tip but steps of service require awareness of when new guests sit down at your bar. As we walked out we mention to a server that we were leaving because we were never greeted. She genuinely cared and tried to save the situation and asked to take care of us. She apologized and said the host was new but we know it was less of a host problem and all of the bars zero attention that caused us to leave. Unfortunately the deed was done and we were going to head to their competitor instead (where it's currently packed as I type).",

    "text": "New Hooters location off I-215 & South Rainbow which opened the end of October. 24hr gaming and live entertainment!  Came here to meet with a group of my friends to watch the football game \"Steelers vs. Broncos\" whooo! Go Steelers! I am a Chargers fan, so normally I wouldn't praise Steelers as much, but I wanted Denver to lose. (no offense to bronco fans)   The Hooters girls that worked there were actually ATTRACTIVE.  than other Hooters I've been to. Whoops! Did I just say that :x  Its True.   Besides the looks, the service was fast and friendly. Rachel, our server, was super! Always came to our table to make sure we were okay or needed anything else. She was on top of her game even when there was a full house. Also, we were in a group of 10+ and she separated our tabs for us. Thanks Rachel! +++  Best new hooters spot in Vegas!",

They had tables open.  We sat down and waited and waited.  My husband flagged down a waitress who stopped for a second and then walked away.  Flagged down a second waitress who was nice enough to stop and let us know she was going to get someone for us.  Such douchy waitresses.    We have been here before waited and waited.  I hoped that their service would have gotten better.  Guess not.    On a positive note, their wings are always solid.",

The managers treat the girls like they're dumb and talk down on them constantly. On top of that, they don't allow them to have breaks nor drink any kind of drink, including water while on shift. I've brought my friend Starbucks quite a few times to it just be thrown in the garbage. I would not give this hooters any business because of the way the girls are being treated. It's unfair and not okay. I'll pick a different hooters to go to from now on.",

Last weekend my siblings and I joined them there for dinner, I wasn't expecting the food to be any better but the service was extremely disappointing! After bringing out our food, if it wasn't for swiftly walking by with head down, I would have thought our waitress left. We had stacks of plates in front of us- gross! My dad got up to find a manager, which wasn't hard considering he was standing at the bar passing it high fives, he explained the situation at our table and returned. Minutes later our waitress arrived asked if we needed anything and brought us our check. The plates still there. Finishing our drinks, my mother flags down the manager explaining the situation that he has already been made aware of. He tried to cop an attitude after she called him out for standing around- not smart. He removed TWO plates and set them on the wall next to us, not a joke. The other plates were removed as we were leaving. Hooters lost me a long time ago but my parents, who are there at least once a week are considering not going back!",

The only down fall was the \"Hooters.\" I had visualized huge knockers. I mean they are nice. They do have a variety. (we can't win them all can we) I rapidly moved on from my minor disappointment.  My brain works autonomously but as soon the waitress offered the special. I went for it.   The special which is 10 boneless wings and their world famous curly fries.  It wasn't that long of a wait. As soon as they arrived at the table I imagined my self like a vulture.  Savaging at those boneless moist and delicious, Chipotle honey wings. With a perfect side of Ranch, and don't forget my refreshing beverage.   I don't like to exaggerate but I probably crossed that line already, this places is really good.   Also as soon as you walk in you get greeted my an older gentleman walking around just being friendly. This place is pretty clean everything is made of wood.   Open 24/7   :)",

Food quality 4 stars: I came here a few times and the first time I ordered wings, it was burnt and more boney than meaty. Typical bar food/appetizers. Nothing too special, but the food here tasted way better than the other Hooters I've been to.   Night owl special: only valid Sunday thru Thursday midnight - 8am.

Although it may seem like the menu had changed drastically it may very well be because it is a franchise.   Still tasty, the sauces could have been a little less drenched on. The Daytona sauce was my favorite & I always enjoy the shrimp. The first time they came out cold. That didn't stop Sonnah. She quickly grabbed them, fired up fresh ones and made sure they even added a few extra.   Like I said Spectacular Sonnah. As service industry Professionals we appreciate service over everything else. Thanks for making a nice and easy Friday evening spectacular.",

Our favorite are the Daytona Beach flavor, sweet and little kick of spicyness, some shrimp, curly fries, sliders, fried pickles... their Ranch is to die for including the blue cheese dressing. They prepare them on site. I had to ask how they prepare it so one of the manager gave me the details of his preparation! that was cool :-) When you come really late, they sometimes play 80s music (LOVE it), still games for the guys. Staff is friendly.  Cool to have you guys near by!",

Me, my wife and my 3lb service dog were seated at a booth when shortly after a waitress let us know that we were not welcome to dine in because of the no service dog policy.  As the supervisor approached us he didn't even introduce himself, he simply tried to look for the sign with the no \"service dog policy\", a minute later, he found a semi hidden sign that stated \"no pets allowed, service dogs welcome\".  First he was rude for not even explaining the mistake on their part, then he had the audacity to say that we could dine in, under the condition that the dog had to behave and stay on our lap. We ended up leaving and going to the Hooters casino on the strip, where the staff is actually trained and act professional. As a local and a US Marine Vet I am informing future customers that the Hooters casino is way better option than this unset location.",

She gave us no menus or anything!!! I have been sitting at the booth with my boyfriend for a good 30 minutes and still haven't been acknowledged, everyone walks by saying absolutely nothing. This is extremely upsetting because those women have no freaking customer service. Hooters have the most terriblest customer service ever and i don't recommend ANYONE TO EVER GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!!",

Cashed out, then dumped in another 40 bucks and lost it all. The douchbag guy bartender working the bar from 8:30-9:30, who wasn't paying attention to anybody at the bar except his friend talking about fantasy football and taking free shots with him, decided to charge me for 2 drinks when i had one that was supposed to be comped. Youd think losing money youd get at least one drink in. Now im dumping more money in the machine and he says he doesnt comp drinks because i cashed out. Wtf kinda shit is that? Why am i at the bar then? Theres so many other bars with great bartenders, while this guy is over here worried about his fantasy football for the entire hr we were there, and then cant even comp me a drink because Im bothering his fantasy football and shot taking with his friend? Yea i wont be coming back. But i won my next hands and left with more money in my pocket than i started with, sooo a big thank you to the douchbag bartender for the free drink, free nachos & free wings! You the real mvp!",

Well good luck in finding them here at this Hooters (located off the strip) lol jk  My rating of 1 star isn't become of the disappointment of presentation of women but because of the horrible service we received over dinner.   My friends and I have eaten at this location a couple of times and for some reason every time we come here, service is always poorly.   The vibe in here isn't like the vibe of the Hooters at Santa Monica, Hollywood or even like the Hooters on strip. The girls are not very friendly and the food was not so yummy either.   I ordered the Philly Cheesecake and the bread was so hard and the meat was so dry. The fries that came with the meal tasted gross and old.   I also ordered some wings with the Parmesan flavor and omg wayyyyy too much flavor. I had to wipe some off with my napkin and drench it in my ranch so I can eat it.  This Hooters location doesn't meet the expectations of the Hooters brand. I don't not recommend it.",

After waiting a few minutes one of the managers brought out a folding table for extra seating. We were seated right away. A hostess I think her name was Jazmine grabbed us waters right away and was very friendly.    Service was surprisingly fast for how busy it was. Disappointed I missed a couple of the first fights waiting, but understandable for the amount of people there. Our waitress had light brown hair. She was very nice and wasn't impatient with us even though it was busy. We confused her with another girl and she joked about how lots of people ask if they are siblings.   Our food was great. We got Daytona wings, fried pickles and curly fries. Everything was hot and crispy. It's hooters. You can't be mad about cold beer, hot wings and a good fight. We got what we came for. Plus a nice view. There's also a girl who looks just like Natalie Wood. That's enough to check the place out.   Overall just impressed about the great customer service on such a busy night.

I was in three days in a row, 2 of which I ordered the same two items both days and had the same server. Crab legs and 6 piece wings. I eat out a lot because I travel constantly on business trips. I look for consistency, especially when it comes to customer service. And I don't mean simply a friendly server. I am a HUGE fan of Hooters, since '85! Three key points: with crab legs you usually get the small fork and a shell cracker with wings and crab legs you usually get wet naps. (Without having to ask for them). Tuesday I got them. Wednesday not so much. I had to ask for replacement paper towels, (ran out) and wet naps didn't bother asking for the small fork. I ordered the key lime pie and when the server (different person) brought the pie she said \"you order this?\" While looking at my table and seeing no fork asked me \"do you need a fork?\" Cmon?  And the pie was frozen. Smh.  I ate here 3 days straight. Day 1 sat at the bar and had Cameron as a server. She was great. Days 2 & 3. Not great. Sadly they will not pay any attention to this but felt the need to tell it how it was...",

The place was not even busy. But anyways. Both orders were for chicken wings and curly fries. I had the original bone in 911 wings which were good. The price was $19 bucks, which is pretty damn steep for 10 wings. They were good but not returning for 19 dollar good.",

I looked around and there was hardly anyone there. Finally the same lady told me to take any seat.   I waited for about 20 minutes and asked a waitress that i was ready to order. She said she was not my waitress and that she will call some one else. I waited another 10 minutes and i looked at the corner and saw three waitressess just sitting and chit chatting. I just left. That was the first time i left a restaurant without ordering. Hey mr manager you have to do something with your waitress. This place sucks!!!",

She said they just cant replace it so why then they just send me the original sauce they can call the customer support if they cant. I asked if the fries too doesnt come with ranch or even ketchup she said no! What restaurant sells fries that you cant have ketchup?! Too much excuses. You fail customer service from onlie ordering wtf. She  was even the one mad for her excuses. If you hate your job then quit!",

We ordered up 10 Garlic Parm to try, 20 BBQ and 2 orders of fries. Everything came out in a timely manner and was delish.  Hot, juicy, yummy wings that is expected of Hooter's.  Maybe you guys should go down and train the staff at the casino location...ick! Great service.  Only downside was that their credit card machines were down and you had to pay with cash.  They did offer a 10% discount for the inconvenience and had an ATM in the restaurant.  Luckily we had cash on us. Recommend this location every time!",

I took a seat at a table near the atm and waited for 45 mins for the food. I went up to go and and ask where the food was and it was literally on the counter next to her for who knows how long.   When I asked her why she didn't tell me the food was ready, she said she didn't know why I was waiting and she \"can't do everything\".   If someone is sitting there with no food or drink in front of them, pretty sure there has to be a reason unless they let people just hang around at the tables. If she didn't know why I was waiting, wouldn't you ask if they need help with someone. Idk how you forget if someone is waiting for good after walking by them 4-5 times serving other guest. Not surprised from other horrible service reviews.",

This location was pretty spacious, and seemed very clean. Finding a seat at the bar or the dining area was not a problem.   I opted to sit at the bar. The bar was pretty large and gaming machines on one side of it.   I took a look at the menu, It sure had a lot of selections and all of it seemed appealing. But being National chicken wing day I opted for none other than chicken wings! They had a deal for  buy 10 wings get 10 wings free.  The wings were pretty good as you would expect from Hooters! Just know if you ask for extra blue cheese they ding you for $1.09!!   They also let me try their smoked wings for free so it definitely was a great visit.  The service throughout was pretty attentive so I imagine it would be a great place to drink as well although I didn't drink there that day",

She definitely seemed she wanted to be anywhere else.  The waitress was nicer, efficient, and got our order out to us pretty quickly.  We ordered 20 shrimp, 10 boneless wings, lots o tots, and drinks.  The food was good as always.  Not fancy, but good.

Lets start with I did not even know her name until I recieved the check. There was no introduction at all, \" what can i get you to drink\" and walked awa.  She came over, as it seemed like I was bothering her from having a conversation with her friend, who I found out was also an employee. She took my order of Grilled Chicken w/ bacon, which came out really good. She did not check on me until I almost done with m food, and it was not because she was busy with work stuff.  I waited a good 15 minutes to get a refill, even though i was starring at her to come over.  As I have been to many hooters I knew this was no right, so i address it witht he bartender/manager who did not seem real caring of the concern.

However the food was also, just mediocre. And when did their wings get so small? 15$ for wings that are teeeeny tiny. Idk I guess I just wasn't impressed w anything, except the Bloody Mary. And then when I reheated my left overs they tasted like rubber and the texture totally changed. It was gross. Their sauce and bloody Mary's are good... the end",

There were probably 10-15 people.   Do not come here EVER. This place sucks! We left after about 15 minutes of sitting in a booth RIGHT NEXT TO THE BAR without even getting a glance.

They have a smoking and non-smoking bar area, table and booth seating, with patio/table seating with roll up doors to the outside.  The food is the standard Hooters restaurant menu.  I personally love the Fried Shrimp in Daytona sauce, and the smoked wings in Texas BBQ rub.    The restaurant is clean and the service is generally good.  The parking lot can sometimes be difficult to find a space, as the parking lot is shared with multiple other businesses.",

    "text": "While on the way to another establishment, on the complete opposite of town, My roommate and I were thoroughly excited to visit Hooters, on account that we actually know what we want when we go there. Hooters trumps all when it's a last minute decision. Or so we thought. KEEP IN MIND THERE WERE 6 individuals in the entire establishment our whole stay.  Back history: This particular location is exceptionally consistent but only on the account that they will spoil your mood with their angry attitudes or incorrectly make your order and make it your fault...hell sometimes both.  Being former Hooters girls, we know all the tips and tricks that are exchanged throughout the kitchen, especially if they mess up your order.   Now EVERY SINGLE TIME we come to this location we start with the buffalo shrimp w/two sauces (1/2 & 1/2) and when i tell you we have NEVER, not once, received the shrimp correctly made i tell no lies.  What kills me is they'll fry the shrimp and toss them in the wrong sauce, the waitress (knowing what we ordered) will have the nerve to still bring them to us like we won't know the difference.  Next, after sending them back, the kitchen won't even remake the shrimp, they'll re-toss them in the correct sauce so that BOTH sauces now resonate on the shrimp, STILL WRONG. 15-20 minutes for a correct order of 12 pieces of shrimp y'all. This particular trip to Hooters of course it happened again (expected)   The manager, i was unable to get his name, served us at the bar. We decided to each order a buffalo chicken sandwich. The menu implied lettuce and tomatoes come with the buffalo chicken sandwich, however upon arrival the manager informed us you only get L&T when you ask. Contradicting information. When we asked him for the L&T he became upset slapped his hand on the gaming screen in front of us and said it was only for gaming when we sat, delivered the L&T, and didn't speak one word to us the remainder of the stay.   While waiting on the new batch of shrimp (ordered as an appetizer) we could see our buffalo chicken sandwiches w/fries sitting in the window ready to be served.  Needless to say our fries and sandwiches were room temperature by the time we got them and we won't be back. Thank you for your consistency Hooters, NEVER again :)  But thank you Tammy for picking up where the other manager left off :)",

No one was at the host stand to greet us until a server came from the kitchen ( servers are the host ) we were sat after waiting for a table to be cleaned off ( and no it wasn't busy at all) the server who sat us was our server and didn't come back to get our drink order for over 5 minutes. I asked for a lot of lemons and was brought 3, had to ask again and was brought another 3. We ordered our food, our appetizer came out after our food, I asked for a lettuce wrap chicken and was told they didn't have the lettuce to wrap it until my food was on the table..  Food was decent but the service definitely could use improvement",

    "text": "It's been awhile since we have been here. I was craving some chicken wings and some fried pickles.  What happened to this place?  It's not the same.  The pickles we're good the few times we have had them or when they first started making them. These we're very thin and seemed to be over cooked or maybe the grease was no good.. they were not my favorite anymore. Just no good taste and over cooked.  The chicken wings? We we're impressed with the size when they came out but but but.. HOOTERS WHAT DID YOU DO????? CHANGING THE SAUCE!! SERIOUSLY? So very disappointed. They were actually pretty gross. To me tasted like cigarettes or ashes. I am not joking.  We asked the waitress what Happened. She said they changed the sauce because people complained it wasn't saucey enough it was thick. So they changed it to a SOY based sauce instead of butter. Seriously? They are NASTY.   NOTHING LIKE THEY USE TO BE. and they went up on the prices no wonder I read somewhere they are not doing as good as they use to do,  you don't change what worked for years!!  We loved the butter based taste. I still buy the medium sauce in the jar when I can find it. I love the original medium SAUCE. They haven't changed that yet. Hopefully they will never change it to the gross stuff they serve.  But sad to say we won't ever go back.  10 wings, fries and pickles for about $27.00! Not worth that kind of money at all. If the food was the way it use to be you wouldn't mind. Oh well we did order 20 wings and it would have been more but we only ate 10 and asked to talk to manager and told her how bad it was. She did charge us only for 10 not 20. We would have left them there neither of us would have ate them. That was a good thing plus the waitress we had was good otherwise it would have been one  star.  Very dissatisfied and disappointed.",

The have recently added a buffalo chicken dip to the menu that i also cannot resist. Service is really good as well. Some waitresses and bartenders better than other but pretty good overall.

    "text": "If you're coming to watch a UFC fight get there before 4pm so you're not charged the cover. Otherwise if you come anytime after 6pm you will be charged $5 unless it's a free showing on FX.  Ask for your check early on these days as it will take awhile. Last time I was there it took about 20 minutes to get the check & another 10 to get it back. Every visit I've had the service is slower than it should be, but because of the fight I realize this.   My recommendation is to sit at the bar. You can get full service of food & drink just as you could in a booth. The bartenders are on top of their game at this location, where as the servers not so much.  The food is average, nothing to write home about, but this location has a great view",

The bartender (or person in charge?), Steve, is super nice. The restaurant has awesome ventilation because it flows to the patio so you won't smell like oily chicken or smoke if you're hanging out at the bar late at night. Expect to pay around $10 for 10 wings.",

    "text": "I've been a fan of Hooters since they first arrived in Las Vegas in the early 90s (late 80s?).  When they opened up this location near my house I couldn't be happier.  First the food. The food is typical hooters.  Really good, but there are places out there slightly better. But combine location, plus cost, plus atmosphere and you really can't do better. I like the wings, naked, all drums, grilled Daytona style with spicy garlic sauce. Also the burgers are really good . I sometimes even get the crab legs or the fried pickles. My only real complaint is the lack of ROASTED OYSTERS.  That's right, when Hooters first opened they had roasted oysters. They came in a large bucket, covered with a hot towel and they gave you an oyster shucker to open them. Hooters management said it was because of the oil spill that happened years ago in the south why they no longer had them.  I really hope they bring them back someday.  As for the staff, management is great.  There are a group of 3 familiar guys that run the place. They are always friendly and helpful.  They'll change the channels for you and even give you the wi-fi password.  As for the waitresses, I'd say 90% of them are at a Hooters level of customer service. When they acknowledge you as \"their table\" you are usually greeted somewhat cheerfully and they are for the most part friendly.  Some fo them even go into their pro acting job and ask you about your day or what you do, etc. We know it's a service industry and that's part of the act, but it is a nice touch. I would say about 5% of the girls go above and beyond. They remember you from the last time you came and they even come and say hi to you even if you are \"not their table\".  It's nice to be acknowledged as a regular.  Sadly most of the time it's by the male management, but like I said, a couple girls remember and say hi regardless.  Sadly the remaining 5% of the girls are horrible. There are only one (maybe two) that I fear getting when I walk in.  I hate that feeling \"well now I got to run the gauntlet today for lunch cuz this girl sucks\". I'm not the type of person to complain about service, especially if I'm a regular. instead I suffer silently.  The girl in question is so bad. She rushes you though the ordering process. She never writes anything down. As you can see from above, I have a complex order, so it's always a gamble if I'll get it right. God forbid it's wrong, I have to decide if it's worth flagging her down, telling she is wrong and getting a new order.  The saying \"a bad apple ruins the bucnh\" is True.  That one ore two employees prevented me from giving a 5 star review.  I hope in the future these employees move on.  I hate playing the gambler when I come in to my local Hooters, \"will I get a good waitress?\" Maybe management can have more customer service training more often.  I've also wrote a review about a Japanese Hooters, explaining how they had the best costumer service I've ever seen.  Maybe the Hooters here can fly a few of those Japanese Hooters girls in and have them train the locals? Japanese girls are HIGH ENERGY, some of the waitresses here would benefit from a little energy boost.  Anyhow, this is a great Hooters, good food, pretty girls, great atmosphere. I'm a fan.  TIP: this place is ridiculous on big sporting event nights, especially UFC fights. I usually go only at lunch time, but I've made the mistake going on a UFC night.  I'm not a UFC fan so I had no clue what was going on.  So if going at night, you might want a backup plan if you drive by and see the parking lot overflowing and people pouring out of the building.",

We went there once when they first opened and didn't go again because it was a bad experience all around. We figured to give them another try because we figured they would have fixed all the kinks by now... and they did :)  We sat ourselves and didn't have to wait long until the waitress showed up and took our drink order. She was smiley and very pretty that even I crushed on her a little bit!   We ordered the fried pickles to start and 20 piece chicken wings. Everything came out in good time. The fried pickles are definitely addicting! The wings were cooked and flavored just as I like 'em.  All in all, it was a pleasant experience. I would go back again for sure!",

Fortunately I live in the southwest side of Vegas, so this location isn't really far from where I live.  This late at night you just walk in and seat yourself. There are no waitresses on shift this late at night so for the drunk pervs, sorry but you might have to get your booty shorts fix somewhere else.  The bar area is the best place to if you want to be attended to right away since its the bartender basically doing everything this late.  If you decide to sit at one of the tables, you might find yourself constantly getting up just to waive him down for simple things such as refills.  Wings here we're still the same price though so don't be fooled and think its 25 cents per wings past midnight like the one in Hooters Hotel.",

    "text": "Hooters is always a cool place to enjoy some cheap brews and football games (during the season of course), but this location wasn't too exciting. I usually attend the Hooters at the Tropicana hotel or at Sunset Station casino but I was leaving church off the strip and ready to catch the NFL season openers of football.  A few friends and I decided to go to this Hooters location for some food and football. As soon as we arrived and walked into the resturaunt the host advised that Directv was down all over Vegas and they're only showing local tv games. Huge upset for NFL fanatics such as ourselves. Since we made the drive thus far we decided to stay. The waitress was very friendly and funny. Grabbed our drink orders as soon as we sat down and quickly brought them out but then again we were the only 4 customers.  Food was ok. I ordered steak nachos and was expecting carne asada or actual steak on my nachos but that's what I get for assuming. The portion of nachos was great. Huge plate, mounted with nachos. My nachos were kinda good but mostly upsetting. The steak was like steak umms (TM) sandwich meat, the cheese was obviously from a can and was just heated up instead of being shredded or fresh cheese, and there was more jalapenos than steak, chips, and cheese. My friends had steak quesadillas that were delicious and I wish I would've ordered those instead.  Overall the location is kinda in the middle of nowhere and the food isn't all that its hyped up to be. And the fact the host told us that Directv was down all over Vegas, even casinos, and nobody was able to watch the games was a complete lie. I have Directv at home and had friends a casinos who was able to view all games. Not really knocking this location but me personally, I'll never spend my money at this Hooters ever again.",

As soon as you walk in there is a small sign that states \"seat yourself\", after reading it the bartender shouted that we needed to seat ourselves. Not once upon entering were we greeted by any employee. I believe a manager took our drink order and I asked him about the mango lemonade, he told me because it was flavored I would not be allowed any refills so I just stuck with the regular lemonade but as i told him that he replied with \"ohhhh come on\". I believe smart remarks are not necessary.  Since today is veterans day all Vets get a free meal upon showing a military ID, my boyfriend showed his and for whatever reason the manager taking our drinks did not believe his military ID was real? He then rudely asked for a drivers license because he needed to be sure that he didn't barrow the military ID from a \"buddy\". The picture on the military ID clearly verifies that it is him. I found that very disrespectful. Although he was doing his job he could have asked in a different manner. There has never been an instance where he has been asked for both IDs to verify that he is in fact in the military.  The waitress that took our wing order was nice but seemed very confused with what she was doing. The wings came out within ten minutes and they tasted okay, however I did not enjoy the cajun wings. As I said before i was expecting so much more from this location. I'll just stick to BWW or Wing stop.",

We were greeted by a rude hostess that wouldn't even walk us to the table she just pointed and said \"y'all can sit there\" the waitress was pleasant but over worked, we waited 30min for food, our appetizers came out with our food, the pickles and pretzels were cold, part of our food was missing and we never received waters that we asked for when we first sat down. After we told another waitress what had taken place and asked for the manager, he never came and they brought more food and mentioned that they wouldn't charge for it. We are extremely disappointed because we weren't asking for free food, we just wanted the manager to know about our experience. When it was time for the bill we let our waitress know that the manager never came, she walked away for another 10min to come back and say her general manager was too busy to come out but took some stuff off the bill. This was the worse experience ever. Will not be back .",

    "text": "I stopped into Hooters for our usual Friday lunch today, with plans to just split some appetizers and have a beer, since none of us were very hungry. The hostess was quick to greet us, and allowed us to pick where we wanted to sit, so we grabbed a table near the bar.   Once we looked over the menus we realized that splitting appetizers wasn't going to work, so we ordered a thing of fried pickles to share and picked out some drinks. Two people in my group ordered beers, myself and the other person with us went with the strawberry lemonade. Little did we know that this comes with or without vodka, and both drinks have the same name... So when large plastic cups of strawberry lemonade without vodka came out we were confused. Thankfully our waitress was quick to offer us new drinks and she let us sip on the virgin versions while we waited.   I decided to order the 10 piece boneless wings, medium heat (which was a mistake looking back, medium means none apparently). I didn't like that carrots, celery, even fries were an additional charge so I didn't bother with anything other then the wings.   I don't need an attractive waitress wearing short shorts to bring me my food in order for me to enjoy it. I just need the food to be good. And it was decent... Nothing to write home about. I think I would have enjoyed my meal a lot more if I had gotten hot wings instead...   That said, I know some people DO go to Hooters for the eyecandy. Our waitress was attractive, and friendly...  she was just a little slow. Not sure if that was her fault, or the result of a slow bartender/kitchen staff.   I'll probably end up back at Hooters sooner or later but I am not in a big rush to do so.",

She came by to introduce herself and said she would be right back. Took her about 12mins to come back so we were sitting there waiting. I saw another server look at our table and she went to look for Bianca. Finally low and behold there she was. She forgot what kind of beer my husband ordered so 2mins after taking our drink order she came back to ask what type of beer he ordered. Then she came by and asked \"did you decide what you want to eat?\" We told her our order. After our order she came back 5mins later to take our menus. Seems as if this girl possibly needs more training. We didnt feel very welcomed. Also my point of view working in the restaurant business the waitresses shouldnt be just sitting around talking, drinking and eating out in the open. Thats what break rooms are for...so I thought. I'm not one to complain about service unless its horrible and I do admit the service at hooter this particular night was horrible. Its a shame too because I enjoy hooters actually have been to hooters in many cities. I was very disappointed. I live close by to this Hooters too so when friends or family are in town I bring them there. Because everyone knows what Hooters is so theres no questions is an amazing wing spot and a place to watch sports or fights on the TVs. Of course the wings were amazing so that I can not complain about. But wings without good service is sad.",

The comedy is open mic and preformed by amateur locals. The host is a drag queen who is just hilarious and isnt afraid to offend or pick on some of the average joes attending.   The rest of the local comedians can range from 'please pass the mic' to 'omg did he just say that?' Definitely not for the faint of heart or for the easily offended.   Starts at 10 ends at 12  The food was a bit disappointing. We all split an order of 50 wings in Spicy Garlic and Mild flavors. After about 45 minutes the host announced the comedy night special which offered 10 wings for 5 dollars any flavor. Kinda pissed our bartender didnt mention that nor did she mention any of the drink specials. We all could have saved some cash ordering less and been a lot happier with flavors we individually wanted.  The Spicy Garlic was neither spicy nor was it very garlicy it did have a pleasing flavor but nothing you would lable 'spicy' or 'garlic'  The mild didnt have sauce of any kind, Bartender explained that it's just deep fried wings tossed in butter. She offered to take it back to the kitchen to throw some medium sauce on it so we let her, when they came back semi tossed in sauce nostrils flared from the hot sauce/vinegar fumes. The bark was obviously worse then the bite. The medium had no bite. The sauce was so mild i didnt think it was any improvement from mild at all.   In the future if i were to come back and order wings i'd request them to be naked and unbreaded. The breading is pretty thick and i cant remember tasting very much chicken at all.  Getting to the point. Hooters is the go to place for sports, beers, wings, and eyecandy in lots of other cities but in Las Vegas there's just so many other places that do the job better.",

    "text": "Horrible service, untrained staff, fake personalities, oh my! You'd think one lives in Vegas or something.. oh wait.   Went here on a Sat afternoon (Aug 22nd) and I hadn't been to a Hooters in a very long time ever since the one near me in Sunset Station closed (terrible leadership decision there). Anyways, you used to goto Hooters for the atmosphere and wings. Now, I'm not really sure why anyone with more than two brain cells would eat, let alone work here.  Service was just, bad. Bad, bad, bad. I sat at the bar which was DEAD, customers wise. Nobody around to talk to at all would make anyone observant enough to notice and think, \"Hmm, I work here and I'm supposed to be friendly and cute to customers, maybe I should engage with this person for small talk!\" Nope. Not one girl came over to ask how I am while alone at the bar munching on my wings. That's just really weird for a place like this.   I ordered the original 10-piece and curly fries. When my food was brought out it was basically slapped down and the waitress walked off never to return. No, I didn't need ketchup, extra napkins or anything else hun.. why bother asking like any professional waitress would? I had to get up from my chair and walk over to grab some condiments and paper towels down the bar. And, what the hell happened to the wet naps they used to give out? Those don't exist anymore?   The wings were, meh. Some were overcooked, while a few of the drumsticks were undercooked with that nasty slimy taste. The curly fries were way too salted for my taste.  While looking around the bar I couldn't help but notice how dirty it was too. I never saw one girl wipe anything down. No pride in their work areas, but they sure do have some HUGE bedazzled purses stuffed under the bar area in plain view.  I had my debit card out and was ready to leave before anyone even came to pick up the plates. Guess I'm too old or expect too much from a place like this nowadays. Yes, it might be in a nicer area of Vegas, but God it's ran so ghetto.",

    "text": "Two and a half stars is too much for this place. I came here while waiting on something else in the area and happen to remember the Golden Knights are playing. I had just sat down at the main bar and the lady bartender (short mid-aged blonde) asked me if I'm playing the bar video machines. I say no and she quickly with an attitude tells me I need to move because these seats are for people playing while watching the game. I look at her and look around at the 16 people sitting around the bar with plenty of available seats and there is ONE person playing. I say umm excuse me, no one is playing, why do I need to move? She says people just getting off work will be arriving soon (I just got off work) and will need the seats for the bar video games. We kinda start arguing about it and I tell her I'm not moving. Another guy comes over and threatens to kick me out if I don't move to the other area. I tell him to look around and see how many people are playing. He does and still says i need ti move. I ask the lady to my immediate right if she is playing and she say no loud enough for them to hear. I slide over to kinda be between the bar video games machines and say there I'm not in-front of the machine now. After this the bartender lady was giving me attitude and took forever to even provide service to me. I eventually have to stop her and ask for water and a menu. I will definitely not be coming back here.",

We sat originally in the dining area, but after 10 minutes of waiting for a server we moved to the bar.  Where we noticed why we weren't being served, the whole dining area only had one server.  Which is ridiculous because the restaurant is split in 2, so theres no way to see customers on the other side.   At the bar there were 2 women bartenders and a gentlemen bartender.  The girl bartenders were constantly calling over a male at the bar to go do shots with them.  One of them was messy, you could tell she'd had a few already.  The gentlemen bartender was serving everyone, the women were just hanging out really. We ordered appetizers, but they weren't treated that way, all the food came out at one time.  The food was fine, I mean already made fried food, can't be too hard.",

    "text": "My husband and I have come to this Hooters a few times...living so close and being in the industry, loving the outside patio and being a gambler, this was a no brainer. Until tonight.  Upon walking in to a half full bar, and one table on the patio, no one greeted us hello...no one even acknowledged the fact that we were there. I proceeded to the bathroom while my husband got a table on the patio. When I arrived, no one had greeted him yet, so I sat down with him to wait.  After waiting 20 minutes, while watching the waitress on her phone and walk past us twice, my husband said to me \" another 5 minutes being ignored and we are leaving\". Oddly with in the first minute, I saw the waitress FINALLY head our way.....  Only to be passed up , to check on the already finished and waiting table behind us. Surely, she has to see the ONLY OTHER table on the patio and greet us, right? NO.  SHE WALKED RIGHT PASSED US FOR THE THIRD TIME. No acknowledgement that we even existed.  For being a \"local\" spot, they surely act as if they could care less about anyone... Little did they know, I'm a GM of a local bar myself, who tips quite generously, who gambles ALOT, and has quite the gift of gab. Sad to say, but this place has lost our business, and if they continue to allow their staff to treat people this way, I cant imagine they will be open for much longer.  Save your self the time and irritation and go down the street to The Sparkling.",

They seated me pretty fast, within about 2 minutes of arrival.   The waitress is nice and attentive.   Not sure of her name but I'll check it out next time she comes to give me another soda which she brings me a refill on before I'm even done with it.   I mostly come to a place to eat for the food, the service doesn't matter to much to me unless it's really terrible.   But with this waitress today, it's quality.  The boneless wings are really subpar.   About 90% breading.  They are too crunchy and then the chicken is tough.  The garlic Parmesan sauce is very unappealing.   I can't really describe it other than not good and I don't recommend you order it.  I just got Buffalo Wild Wings a few days ago and their sauce and quality is about 7,000 times better.   The hot boneless wings are a little better but still not good.   Overall, for the $8 it's gonna cost for the drink, free wings and a tip, it's certainly not worth it.  I honestly don't think I'd pay anything for this food.  I feel like I just wasted calories by just eating fried breading.  I like some chicken with my boneless chicken and there none here to speak of.   I won't be back.   Not even for my free wings next year.",

I explained that all I needed was a beer. I now know that your staff is unable to open a tab, pour a beer, close the tab and that with many people available on the floor, including a manager, this task is beyond the call of a wing bar on a pleasant fall afternoon. I would imagine that you will have some very interesting justifications for what happened and why. Just know that after a lifetime in the food and beverage business, none of them will suffice.",

The bar tender who was on staff was to busy drinking, and on his \"break\" to get our drink order prepared.  The one girl who was working had some attitude and didn't give us a heads up that the chef and bartender were on break so we waited for 90 minutes before getting our food order... We were the only table in the entire place. The drink order we had to cancel.  Once we finally got our order the chicken was overcooked and rubbery.   Living so close to this specific hooters location and being a gambler if the food and service was even decent I would come back often.... Only gambling I'll be doing there is waiting to see how sick I get from the terrible cooked wings i just had. I don't often Yelp but this experience was terrible and I thought I would let everyone know to stay away... If you want wings go to Buffalo Wild Wings on Durango, If you want to gamble & drink go to one of the other hundreds of gaming bars in town. Trust me STAY AWAY. It's not worth it.   Epic Fail... I'm embarrassed for taking my friends here and really feel this location gives a very negative name to all hooters. The manager, staff and whoever else is in charge should be ashamed of the lack of service and quality of food.",

The time between order and presentation of his order was roughly 40 minutes.  They weren't busy in the restaurant,  at all. When his AYCE order finally arrived, he told her no thanks, then walked the eff out. Apparently, the story was the cook made the wrong order for him,  so he waited another who knows how long before the meal came to the table. I think if that's True, she could've offered him the accidental food while the real food went in. An AYCE order, which is pricey, should not be 40 minutes between orders. Come on,  folks.... Besides that fiasco, my buffalo shrimp and ranch were on point. Still, the service at Hooters isn't really service.",

I was at the restaurant a few days earlier to watch a few football games and ordered some food to go for the family at home. We tried the bacon wrapped drumsticks. Now a few days later and someone who is housebound wanted more. So I called in the order and off I went. Get back home and they screwed the pooch. I ordered the bacon wrapped drumsticks naked (no sauce). The person that took the order told me that the bacon wrapped drumsticks came with no sauce. I told her that last time I was there the menu stated that there was sauce and that was why I was now ordering with no sauce. She said not to worry. No sauce was the way they came. I pick up the order with some other items I ordered and get home. Open the bacon-wrapped drumsticks and they are covered in sauce. I call and the same person answers the phone and I explain the situation and she is confused that there was sauce on the bacon wrapped drumsticks. I tell her to open the menu and check and I am sure she will, as I stated earlier, see that they come with sauce, which is why I ordered them naked. So now I have to drive all the way back to hooters to give them the \"screwed the pooch\" order back and pick up the naked bacon wrapped drumsticks that I ordered to begin with. A barely audible sorry squeaks out of her lips as I give her the pooched up order and get the right order. Not even so much as an offer for something for wasting my time and me having to drive all the way back to get something they screwed up. ALSO!!! Go on the hooters website and try to leave a review. Nothing! They have a place to click for a review, but it goes to a blank page. Also, the website shows that you can order online. This would have allowed me to place the order correctly. Take out the human error of employees that do not know their own menu. But that order online does not work either. I told them this when I called in the order and the response was that they did not even know you could order online.   I will find another place closer by and ask them to try wrapping the drumsticks in bacon. There are many PT's restaurants nearby and I am sure they would be willing to provide this for us so I do not have to drive to hooters again.    Hey, hooters! I know it's all about the T&A for you and many customers, but some of us actually want good food prepared and provided as ordered.",

I think LILLY was our server. She was super sweet & very attentive. I can be very needy as the bois have already mentioned to her... but she was able to get me everything I needed. I would have to say the drinks always took the longest though... I wasn't paying too much attention around me because the game was on... so couldn't determine if it was because of the bartender or if it was the server...  Food is just bar food here... but I ALWAYS love to get my steamed shrimps from here!  CURLY FRIES $2.99 - they were a bit under cooked & cold   20 PIECE WINGS $20.99 - we got half naked & half battered. The wings were cooked to perfection & I would expect nothing less of a place that is known for their wings. Although... we did get the sauces on the side.. it was said that the garlic hot sauce was the 2nd hottest sauce but it seemed like the same level of spice as the original hot sauce.   BUFFALO CHICKEN SALAD $10.99 - greens w/ onions, bleu cheese, Bacon, tomato, & ranch dressing. I would have to say it is very LITTLE amount of chicken on there... a bit disappointing & barely any Bacon.  1/2 LB. STEAMED SHRIMP $14.59 - never disappoints & cooked to the PERFECT juicy texture.  ONION RINGS $7.29 - ummm definitely not worth the price... but it was good.  CARAMEL FUDGE CHEESECAKE $5.49 - wouldnt ever get a dessert here again... ahahhhah not really worth the price but it wasn't that bad in taste.",

We ordered wings and nachos.  The girl asked us if we wanted the wings breaded or not....ummmm, I don't remember there being choices.  I just remember thinking hooters had pretty decent wings.  Now what?!? We asked the server her opinion...she said, \"I thought you said you had been here before.\"  Then, she recommended the naked/unbreaded variety.  We decided to wise up and try both.  We ordered them medium and she warned us that their medium was very mild, so we ordered them hot.    Oh my! That was difficult.    Well, we concluded that the breaded version is far superior to the naked version and the \"hot\" is indeed not spicy so I'm sure the medium is ultra mild.  Whoa! Did you follow all that? Should wings be this complicated?  Their wings are almost covered in a buttery sauce....very different than other buffalo wings.  They were A-OK but not one of my top picks for wings.  The nachos were MEH.    This location is nice because they have a big indoor/outdoor patio.  We ended up spending around $30 for 2 sodas, wings and nachos.  A bit steep.",

I have to say that I was very surprised, their food hit the spot, I called in an order for fried pickles, lot-a-tots, boneless wings w/ fries and 10 Wings TO GO. What really made this experience awesome was the hostess, she was awesome in helpiing order like having all the stuff for the tots on the side so they did not get soggy and also ordering the pickles extra crispy so they were also not soggy.

Our server brought us our drinks and we asked for some more time to decide what we wanted to order. 15-20 minutes later our server came back and asked if we were doing alright. She then remembered that we hadn't ordered yet. She apologized and said that she had put are appetizer order in already. Where I was seated I had a good vantage point of the entire kitchen. I could see tickets were stacking up and food was not coming out. A tall white guy seemed to be running the show in the kitchen and the wait staff were upset that food was taking so long. Two of the five cooks were standing next to each other and talking and joking around. When the wait staff inquired about their food the tall white guy scoffed at them and made rude remarks. After about an hour our food finally made it out, well kind of. They gave my buddy and I curly fries when he ordered tater tots and I ordered big dipper fries. We all received our food except my son who ordered the kids burger. We told the waitress the problem and she took our plates back to the pass and talked to the tall white guy and he sent her back to our table with the plates. She said that we could have the curly fries and they would bring out additional tater tots and big dipper fries. 15 minutes or so later she brought a huge side of tater tots and a huge side of big dipper fries and my son's burger. The tater tots were super dark and way over cooked and when my son opened his burger the inside of the bun was black charcoal burnt. I showed our server and she took the burger back, 15 minutes later he got a new burger with a bun that was edible. Our server came back later and apologized for all the problems and that's when I explained to her that I knew it wasn't her fault and that I could see the issues in the kitchen.  I told her that if it had been my restaurant I would fire the entire kitchen staff.  She explained that it had been a busy week, I told her that the person in charge of the kitchen seemed super unorganized and unfriendly. She asked if I was talking about the tall white guy and I said yes, she told me that he is the GM. This place needs an overhaul starting at the top, this was my first and last time coming to Hooters.",

    "text": "An odd place to celebrate my birthday but I'm odd to begin with haha came here around 10:30pm. Also note this was my first time coming here.  AMBIANCE: Wasn't crowded and the bar was practically empty. I noticed two cooks in the kitchen. Pretty quiet on a Thursday night if you ask me.  FOOD: We decided to completely pigout and ordered 50pcs of wings half breaded and half naked, and mozzarella sticks. Cheesecake for desert. I also had their vodka and lemonade as well. The wings($34.95) were pretty solid. Tasted really good and were spicy enough for me to handle. My boyfriend and I couldn't defeat all those wings though had to take some home instead. The mozzarella sticks($6.95) were disappointing. I believe they were still cold on the inside because when I took a bite there wasn't any yummy gooey cheese stretching itself out! Boooo! But still tasty. The Vodka lemonade was strong and not watered down which was good! The cheesecake($3.99/slice) was surprisingly good! The caramel and nuts that came with it made it even better.  SERVICE: Service was 50/50, there were two girls. The first girl who I believe her name was Chantel was friendly, smiling and attentive. She made sure to check back on us, either that or she was watching us if we could take on the 50pcs of wings lol. The other girl who I didn't get a name was cold and she seemed bored and ready to go home.  If you want wings this is a good place. Though I don't think I'd be getting anything else here.",

The food was cold, the server never acknowledged us, she messed up the order, and it took our waitress (Kaylyn) forever to get anything for us if we asked.  The funny part: she was only working about 5 tables. The manager was in-house, but never realized what was going on. All table's around us had the same issues. Luckily my dad thinks he always has to tip well and gave her a decent tip. If it was me she would have gotten zero dollars.  Also I've never seen my mom complain about service and today was a first. One of the worst food industry experiences my family and I have ever had. Thanks hooters! Never again. Honestly, the front and back of the house need to be let go and this location needs a fresh start with proper training.",

The food was tasty, the beer was cold, the monkeys made all the hooters girls come and say hi (Tip for all the men out there...bring an adorable child and the girls will flock to your table) and the manager was awesome (he was making sure all was well in the restaurant and he seemed to genuinely care about how we were doing....very nice touch).   The only drawback was our server. She seemed bothered to even be there. We didn't make any special requests, my monkeys were more quiet than most of the adults and we were trying to be friendly but to no avail. Like I said before...you can't win them all. We will be back because we are suckers for the wings.",

Every time we went we sat at the bar with no one even greeting us for at least 10min.  The first time I tried to sit at an empty seat to gamble and they told me they were saving it for someone coming in later.  Um, what?!  We had to stand after that and eventually left bc we couldn't get service and couldn't sit at the bar bc 3 chairs were being \"saved\" for ppl.  The second time, we ordered drinks and shots... got our drinks, no shots.  We reminded her about our shots when we finally saw her again.... still didn't bring them to us.  Finally, after the third time asking for our shots, she brought them to us. The third time, we went for the fight and again they had the bar seats \"saved\" for ppl coming in later. We ordered beers and got them about 20min later.  We closed our tab and left.  We will never be back.  Sad that this could be a nice place considering they have the fights/games and outdoor seating.  But the horrid customer service is what kills it.",

To my surprise, they weren't what I thought they were going to be. Nobody acted like they were better than you or prettier to talk to you. They did say seat ourselves which is cool. We didn't wait long until Sarah came and asked us if we wanted to get started with drinks. She was super nice. My beau and I got the Lots of Tots as appetizers and it was AMAZING. I ordered the Daytona Wings breaded. It was good. Wish I asked for naked. GO NAKED. But that's my fault. I ordered also a mango lemonade. BOMB. For a hot summer day, I suggest getting this! I didn't know I could get free refills on this drink, so i was slowly drinking it. I guess Sarah heard me slurping the bottom of the glass and waited for me to put my glass down and immediately grabbed my glass and refilled it! Awesome!! Then beau and I started to leave she asked if I wanted more of the drink. I told her no, we were leaving. She told me we can get a TO-GO cup! DOUBLE POINTS! I loved the atmosphere and the manager checked on us too. I liked it and will be coming back.   One thing though: I wish it wasn't so cold and my food would stay hot longer. But it's probably our fault because who chose where to sit.",

    "text": "So I'm a loyal Hooters customer !! I've been to 100's across the country over the last 23 yrs and I'm sad to say this hooters takes the crown as the worse hooters in the United States ! Entering the restaurant we did not receive the ever so annoying \"WELCOME TO HOOTERS\" shout from all the girls !! So my friend and I made our way over to the bar area , I picked the seats closest to the well station cause there was literally 4 waitresses 1 bartender and 1 manager in that area so I figured I would get great service !! Sat there for 5 minutes literally an arm length away from these 6 employees and not one of them greeted us or took a drink order ! They all just sat there shooting the shit ! My friend and I decided to leave these seats since we weren't being served anyways and we walked 15 feet into the gaming area hoping service mite be better on this side ! We were quickly greeted and served drinks ! As I sat there I looked around this place and I reminisced of all the locations I've visited over the yrs , my wings came out quickly 10 breaded seasoned HOT , they were large wings but literally tasted like they were marinated in Tabasco sauce !!! Disgusting ! I drank my bees and watched the employees interactions and I was absolutely shocked !! This place is obviously a locals hangout !! The conversations between the employees and customers highly inappropriate !! The female employees and male employees poor boundaries !! I've got to say the place wasn't busy but they had lots of girls working !!! Well I take that back , they were hanging out more than working !! Advice to management I do believe it's against health code for an employee in uniform to be eating wings or any food behind the bar and then take an order !! Jesus she didn't even was her hands after licking the wing sauce from her fingers !!!! And this is the first time I've ever seen a bartender take a shot of liquor behind the bar while working !!! And now I have no clue what the law is on this but I'm just gonna take a wild guess that even if it's not a law it's probably against some policy for the bartender to take a food and beverage order and while waiting to go around the other side of the bar and put money in the gaming machine and gamble !!!!! And WIN !!! Running back around the bar to the cash register and cash out her $20 ticket !!! I was shocked when I saw the employees actions but then it all made sense when I saw the managers who looked like they were in their early 20's playing grab ass with the girls !!!! I made a promise to myself never to come back to this hooters , so unprofessional ,no hooter spirit , the whole time there never once heard welcome to hooters !!!! Place sucks it's dirty , bartenders drinking and gambling , waitresses sitting around eating wings behind the bar licking finger!!! Please go to a break room so nasty ! And managers who look like high school kids playing grab ass with the girls !!!!! This place is an unprofessional messy epic fail !!! HIGHLY ENCOURAGE COOPERATE TO STEP IN ASAP",

She was super attentive, knew the menu well and drew the cutest owl on my sons kiddie cup of water.  I was torn between 2 sauces and she brought both.  She asked me if i wanted ranch or blue cheese and I told her to surprise me.  She did...with both!  We had to have the wings recooked because we ordered them well done and they weren't.  She did it with a smile on her face.  We also asked for a new hotdog bun cause the first one was a rock and she replaced it promptly and with a smile on her face.  The only downside was the other waitresses sitting at the table behind us with either a gentleman manager or shift leader talking about their nights out.  Definitely not what I wanted my son to hear.  I turned around at least 3 times before the gentleman apologized and they moved to the side station to continue their chatter.  I am assuming they use that table as a server/shift table to eat at b/c at all times one or more person was sitting there either eating or talking.  All in all I appreciate great service and Chantel gave be better service than I received at Craft Steakhouse last week.",

Went soon after they opened and were very disappointed in everything.  Wrote to corporate, they sent gift cards.  The GM called us and apologized and invited us to come back in. We took him up on his offer and gave them another try.  When we got there we introduced ourselves to the GM and he made sure all was taken care of.  Everything was great!  Went back again another time, did not introduce ourselves and once again bad food and service.   Every fathers day we go to hooters so we went to spring valley again to give them one more shot.  BIG MISTAKE!  They were not busy at all.  No one greeted us.  We picked out a table and sat down.  Waitress came over, very nice, and took our order.  I sent the margarita back, it was horrible, nothing but sweet and sour mix.  Food was not as bad as the previous times but no where near as good as the time the GM took care of us.  As we were waiting for our check and to go boxes we watched our waitress go outside, get in a car, make out with some guy!  Finally another waitress came over and said she would help us.  I saw no manager on the floor during the entire time we were there.  I guess you can only get good food or good service when the GM knows you are coming!",
