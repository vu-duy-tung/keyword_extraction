I wish I had taken pictures. It we ate everything so quick. We had a spider roll, Philadelphia roll, caterpillar roll, and tempura spicy tuna roll. Then we order another tempura roll and a shrimp tempura roll. All were amazing. Service is impeccable. We are stuffed and happy. We will be back soon!!!",

The lady who takes phone orders couldn't understand anything I said and then accused me of calling in earlier and trying to order a tuna poke bowl?? I was asking for a salmon burrito or rollito as we had just been in a few days ago to get a spicy tuna and shrimp tempura burrito (as the lady called it) and they were both great.  Really disappointing.  Please put someone on the phone who can answer questions and provide a great experience so I'll want to come back again and again.  Won't be placing any more phone orders unfortunately.  Also wish the website was updated and loaded pictures.",

    "text": "The name \"Sushi Cafe\" is a little misleading, disappointing and underwhelming. The last thing Sushi Cafe is, is just another sushi joint. Bento Cafe? Sushi burrito Cafe? Lunch box Cafe? Poki Cafe? All of those would bring more people in and would better describe their menu.  I think the highlight of Sushi Cafe is their Protein Box lunches. Rice, veggies, seaweed salad, korokke, egg and your choice of meat = Protein box. The Monster Box includes a giant sushi burrito and 5 pieces of sushi. SUCH a good deal AND they serve it in those cute brown boxes and not styrofoam- yippeee!  I've had the fried white fish and the chicken protein box. Fried white fish: I was a little worried at first (it looked like the frozen fish sticks you can buy), but they were far from it. There was plenty of fish in it and it tasted GOOD. I loved it, but for me, having fried fish and also fried korokke in the box was a little too much fry for me. It put me into a food coma way too fast.  Chicken protein box: yes, yes, yes. So much chicken! The sauce is in a container on the side so you don't have to be worried about it being drenched in teriyaki.   The sushi bento boxes were another story.  The quality of the nigiri was HORRIBLE and the giant rolls were pretty bad. The salmon in my roll was so tough I couldn't bite through it. It was like chewing on rubber- a couple of bites of that and I had to spit it out. It was easily the worst piece of fish I've ever had. I would not recommend ordering anything with raw fish from here.   There is no AC in Sushi Cafe................................ I wouldn't recommend eating here, just taking out on your lunch break or on your way home. They also have some Japanese snacks, drinks (Calpis, etc) for sale and cup noodle with a hot water machine as well.",

We even stayed loyal during their unfortunate closing and reopening. The superwhite is what brought us here the most. Then the superwhite was suddenly not available. And now I'm told they won't care it any longer. The price is average and the rolls are comparable to other places in the area. Unfortunately the superwhite is the game breaker. We live around the corner from here so we might stop in once a month or so. Sorry but if it's a more expensive fish then charge accordingly. Patrons like myself will happily pay.",

I LOVE Korean food and this place has some really good Korean-style meats that you can get delivered which is awesome. There's no other place for this kind of food around here that delivers (I'm looking at YOU Jun's!). I had the fried philly-roll and it was good, but not really what I was excited about anyway. i really love dwaeji bulgogi so when I saw the spicy pork box, I knew I would like it and I did. It was le-noms. Another thing that they have that's really good is the Korean style fried chicken. Of you are a fan of Korean fried chicken places like Kyochon, you should def try the fried chicken here. It's tasty! I highly recommend this place especially if you want Korean food without leaving the house!",

    "text": "As others have stated, Sushi Cafe is extremely clean and very fast with getting orders ready.  I walked in, looked at menu then ordered.  This was the longest part of the process - choosing what to get.  Once I ordered and paid for the spicy tuna roll, california roll and bulgogi box it was five minutes or less before my order was ready.  I took the sushi back to the hotel where my son and husband devoured it.  The review of the spicy tuna was that it was delicious and actually spicy.  (Too many times at other places 'spicy' tuna rolls are anything but spicy.)  The california roll was devoured without a word - so that's a plus, because it was a very picky eater eating it.  My only negative is that I had some fatty meat in the bulgogi box.  Granted, bulgogi will have fatty pieces, but there was one piece that I actually couldn't eat.  It wasn't bad enough to drop the star rating down to four, but thought I'd mention it.   Overall, everything was delicious, fresh and ready fast!  When a restaurant is as clean as Sushi Cafe, it gives a person confidence that the food prep area is kept clean.  If I'm ever in the area again, I will definitely come back again.  *Side note* For a taste of something unique, try the Korean Nongshim (brand) shrimp crackers in the front.  These are hugely popular in Korea.  For me, I think they're nasty, but I don't like shrimp. ;)  (They're actually like chips and not crackers in the US traditional sense.)",

I wish they offered just a normal sushi rice option.  Also, the Korean bbq box looked a lot like the bulgogi box for some reason.

They also carry specialty snacks and drinks.  Too bad they don't have a location choose to my house otherwise if be there at least 2 times a week!! Thanks you guys, it was delicious!",

Everything was delicious and not very pricy. It was definitely more than enough food (good thing) and very enjoyable. Right as we walked in we were greeted by the owner/manager, (not sure) and he explained everything on the menu since it was our first time. Overall, it was a great find. Unfortunately, there weren't many people and business is a bit slow, so hopefully it speeds up soon!",

I didn't trust it in the beginning because of the fact that it's cheap but when I decided to come here, I'm still so astonished !!!   This is definitely my easy go-to sushi place!

It came with seaweed salad, sweet fried potatoes pieces, white fluffy rice, pickled garlic and what not and all for under $10.    The sushi rolls, were not so good here for me.  I had the spicy tuna roll and was it an overload of sodium.  I guess they haven't gotten the mixture of spiciness against the salt ratio down pack. It was major turn off, so it made the rest of my perception of this place go from oh I can totally do this drive for this food to never mind.  I can't imagine what their poke would taste like if they can't even mix spicy tuna.  The up side to it all, the fish is good and the price is probably a pretty good price point.  The sushi rolls weren't good at all, but the nigiri such hamachi, tuna and salmon weren't bad for $2.95 a set.    For me, the box all the way if I would come back for a 3rd visit.",

    "text": "I was recommended this place from a friend because they told me they had sushi burritos. I came in for lunch to give it a try! It's tucked in a plaza so you have to look carefully while driving around the parking lot.   Upon entering, to the left was a huge chalkboard that listed their box specials, and the cashier gave us a paper menu to look at.   I decided to go with the Salmon burrito box special. I am pretty picky about what I like and don't like to eat, and I specified that I would like to have half salmon and half tuna, with crab mix, spicy mayo, and eel sauce. She told me that all of that would be added in there. However, when I received my burrito there wasn't any crab mix.   The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the food is actually pretty good for what you're paying. For $10, I got a sushi burrito (it's probably the size of 3 eggrolls), and 5 pieces of sashimi and 2 gyoza. At first I thought it was an okay deal, but it turned out to be more than filling!  Knocking off one star for customer service because it took us over 20 minutes to get our food (most likely because of deep frying the gyoza), and the lack of explanation of the menu. But overall I would come back here for lunch when I am craving sushi. I'll just remember to call it in",

We originally visited because it was close to us, then we sat down and had an awesome experience. Not only is the sushi the BEST in the area, but the staff was great as well. It's clean, the food comes out fast, and was just overall a very pleasant experience. Also, if you live close they will deliver for free. Did I mention the prices are cheaper than most Sushi establishments? MUST VISIT if you want sushi!!!!!",

They're focus is somewhat healthier versions of US sushi. Def not the most traditional food, but quite tasty. The owners/staff were really friendly and took their time explaining their food and concept and went out of their way to be welcoming overall.      As I'm not a huge raw-fish fan, I went with the spicy pork bento, an order of gyoza, and an order of edamame (I was in a large group and intended to share some gyoza and edamame). Everything was quite tasty! I really enjoyed the pork, though it could have been spicier, and the rice was really good too! It's a mix of white and brown and topped with furikake. The meal also came with a few pickles, a small seaweed salad, and a gorokke (croquette). Their croquette is again, intended to be lighter, and is mixed with kabocha for a sweeter taste, rather than having a sauce. The gyoza also came without a sauce, but I found on both parts I wasn't quite missing anything.      The only kinda of negatives to watch out for, are that this place does all of its plating in to-go boxes. While this is super easy for a quick lunch or post-work out dinner, it may not be the most special date-night, if you're looking for something fancy. Also, the edamame are only lightly salted, not coated in the rock salt in used to. It's still really tasty, just not what I was expecting. Also, they don't have a liquor license, so no after-class beer and edamame at this time, which is probably better for my waist line anyway.  Overall a great little place. It's definitely going to be my new Friday night after-class hangout!",

My sashimi cuts were generous, and only $4.95 for 4 slices of the salmon sashimi, and another $4.95 for 4 slices of the yellowtail sashimi. I'm really particular about spicy tuna and there's was pretty good. If you're looking for a fancy or super swanky sushi place, this isn't it, but if you enjoy sushi, sashimi, poke, and other items at a very reasonable price for what you get with a very laid back environment, this is for you. They will do free delivery if it's with a 3 mile radius with a $30 purchase, and are also available for delivery with some other delivery services. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The gentleman who took my order and rung me up was polite and kind when I asked for extra radish, he asked if I wanted a water cup since I didn't order a drink, and even came over to check on me later to make sure I had gotten enough radish. Fish quality was very good and very fresh, I'm still shocked at how inexpensive my sashimi was for such generous slices. I'm also very picky about sushi and quality, and while some of their rolls do have imitation crab, which I don't eat as it makes me ill, there is plenty of fresh selection and the prices can't be beat. I've been eating sushi since I was 6 and this will definitely be a great stop for me. I will definitely have this as a go to for when I just want a quick roll or two, I definitely can't say enough good things about this place.",

The food quality has really taken a tumble(fish is not fresh, borderline frozen/dried out when served), ordered a tempura roll and was served a lightly cooked roll which was mushy and not really edible, no music, soda machine no longer works, the waitress is fairly nice but she is not hygenic - both this visit and prior one I've seen her cough on her hands or without covering her mouth and also prep side dishes without gloves on or washing hands after touching money - very disgusting.",

Seaweed salad, rice, cucumber, spicy tuna, LOTS of spicy mayo (so order it less or without if you don't like spicy mayo so much), and half a pound of salmon!! So good, and very good price. We also got a \"sushi burrito\" which they call the monster roll meal. Also wonderful. Highly recommend",

The food is fresh and fairly light, and I especially like how the rice is a white-brown combination.  The White Fish box was plenty of food for one, with two planks of fried fish on a bed of cabbage, with the rice and sides of seaweed salad, pickled veggies, tamago and some sort of sweet potato croquette? I liked everything enough to grab a takeout lemon roll for my guy, who inhaled it and assured me the fish was fresh.  Good addition to the area, focusing on fast lunch should make them a hit with the nearby office parks or for those visiting the nearby DMV. Props for giving this area another healthy option!",

You can actually taste the fish. They also fried us some tofu, which was not on the menu. That was nice of them. The yellowtail hand roll and the dragon roll were also excellent.  The kitchen and dining area were very clean. The staff was very friendly. It was definitely worth the drive from Summerlin. I recommend that you stop in and have some poke or whatever else you care to try. I will be back!!",

On a Thursday night. It wasn't packed, probably 2 tables occupied.   Their menu doesn't have a lot but I consider that a good thing. I opted for the tempura box & we shared a jackpot roll. She ordered the Korean BBQ box. I didn't expect to see a lot of food in the box that I ordered but, to my surprise, it came with other stuff besides the tempura & rice! It also had tamago, gyoza, seaweed salad, and pickled something. I didn't try the pickled thing but everything in my box was amazing. The tempura was plentiful and definitely wasn't too heavy. I wish they put furikake on the rice (maybe I'll ask for that next time). I tried her Korean BBQ & it was alright, nothing spectacular. The jackpot roll was really good! It had a little kick to it.   Service was great! The server made sure our waters were always filled and asked us how everything was frequently. There are many Japanese/sushi places next to me so idk if I'd go all the way to the other side of town, but I'll definitely stop by if I'm around the area!",

I have had this on my list and sushi is light so this was the winner.  My first impression is that the restaurant is very clean and simple. The employee working at the counter greeted us immediately. He gave us a paper menu to look at and help us decide what to order since we were obviously there for the first time.  Our order came up in about five minutes which I thought was fast for a walk in order. Everything was packaged nicely and they even included napkins, silverware, chopsticks, and soy sauce.   All of the rolls we ordered were very good and fresh. They were notably better than other sushi I've had recently. The Lemon Roll was my favorite and the lemon added a great twist to the flavor. The Shrimp Tempura Roll was delicious and had plenty of crunchy topping. The Mexican Roll had the perfect amount of avocado on top and the right amount of heat. My edamame wasn't very tender and not my favorite item. The Green Tea Cheesecake sounded interesting, but was not my cup of tea, pun intended. There was nothing wrong with the cheesecake, it just wasn't my thing.  The menu definitely offers more than just rolls so I'm excited to return and try more of the menu items.",

Also if you are dining in, your orders are served in dinnerware  instead of paper boxes. Little improvements like this are cool and good to see that owners listen to their customers feedback! Since I have seafood allergies, glad that they delicious options! My favorite here still is the Bulgogi box.",

I explained to her my allergy and she assured me that they have other items on the menu that did not contain seafood.  My daughter absolutely love her California rolls and cannot wait to go back. The prices are amazing it doesn't break the budget. The decor is very nice. This is definitely going to be on the top of our list of places to eat when we are undecided for dinner.",

Being pregnant I thought it was just me and only ate one while my husband and son ate the rest. Early this morning we were woken up to my son throwing up in bed. He threw up several more times that night and my husband had REALLY bad burps and is still dealing with terrible runs today that are making him miserable. Even though I only ate one I'm also having issues with nausea and the runs.  So I originally gave a one star review based on us getting some food poisoning from one of our rolls, but I'm updating it based on the great customer service we received when we let them know. One of the owner's came to our place to personally refund us money and explain the situation as well as invite us to come in and try them again with a free meal. We will take advantage of this based on the issue being a delivery one and the many good reviews they have as well as the good customer service.",

However, my second visit was a bit unpleasant because I was on lunch break and due to slow service, I had only 10 minutes to eat my food. My only piece of advice would be to be super attentive to those dining in. Taking their order as soon as they say they are ready to order and getting those orders in asap because some people are limited on time.",

I had Yellow Tail which melted in my mouth and freshwater eel that was sweet and very tasty. Also had the kiss of dragon which was spicy but very good. They ask you from a scale of 1 to 10 how spicy do you want it I love spicy food and I went with a seven which I think was a little hot next time I will try a 5 or 6 Maybe. Definitely recommend this place to others there is no sushi bar so don't expect to sit there only tables and a couple couches which was still fine I was okay with that.",

Once,  I'd understand but both of the next  times I called in a to go order, I reminded them to make sure, due to the error. 3 times a $12 lunch, which I don't mind, but I need to be able to eat it. I hate seaweed & it ruined my lunch. When I told the regular manager/cashier my next time in, he says \"oh, that's too bad\". Yeah, too bad for you because you lost a customer.",

I thought they'd sit you first but you have to order first, and if you're eating \"for here\", they'll tell you to sit and they bring your food to you, then you pay when you're done eating. The only menu I saw were boards on the wall so it was hard to see what I was ordering. There were just names and I didn't know what was in any of the rolls. I had to depend on Yelp (thank you!).   Service was great, though! The cashier/waitress was very friendly. The wait for our food wasn't too bad either.   I ordered a combo bowl. I was hesitant about the price (~$12) but when I saw what was actually included in my bowl, I understood why. I got raw salmon, spicy tuna, surimi crab, seaweed salad, masago, avocado, ginger, rice, some greens, and probably other things that were hidden under everything else. I enjoyed by food and was happy to be bringing home leftovers.   The price for a roll is pretty affordable and two rolls can fill you up. I'd definitely come here for rolls if I don't want to spend so much on AYCE. ~$4.50 for nigiri may be pushing it, so I'll probably do AYCE somewhere else for that.",

(I question the validity of their reviews now,). We chose to dine in at a time that wasn't busy, specifically to avoid the rush and go when it wouldn't be stressful for the staff. We were literally the only people there and the waitress STILL pressured us to choose what we wanted as soon as we sat down. She made it even worse, because when we said we needed a minute to decide she rolled her eyes at us. We just stood up and left after that. It was ridiculous. I don't know if that person was filling in for someone, or having a bad day, but we never prompted that kind of rude behavior. I will never go here again, because it was an awful experience. Learn some common courtesy and manners.",

Unfortunately, a lot has changed since they first opened.   They got rid of some of my favorite menu items. When we asked why they no longer have it the server said it was simply because they could not afford it anymore. Quite sad because this place was an awesome sushi spot that served lunch boxes! The Korean bbq box was my personal favorite. Their lunch boxes comes with your choice of meat, seaweed salad, (2) potstickers, tamago, and rice.  We recently visited again and ordered the bulgogi box and a couple of sushi rolls. I got the spicy rainbow roll and it seems that the quality of fish is not as good anymore.   The service is friendly and they redecorated the interior of the cafe but I would probably only return for the bulgogi box!",

    "text": "I love this place because I can get sushi at an affordable price without having to leave Henderson! They definitely need to have more Asian food around this area and the popularity of Sushi Cafe is a good indicator of that.  I have tried the shrimp monster combo, bulgolgi combo, and the poke bowl (I almost spelled Pokeball instead...but there is a Pokestop nearby so farm away while waiting/eating!).   Shrimp monster combo is my go to for takeout whenever I am craving for some sushi. For about $11, you get 5 pieces of nigiri, a croquette, and a shrimp tempura california roll style burrito. It is a bunch of food which can easily be enough for 2 meals. I highly recommend trying this if you don't know what you want lol. I did notice that the veggies they use in the burrito does vary at times (a low point was when they gave me a bunch of iceberg lettuce) so just be aware of that.   The bulgolgi combo is pretty good as well. It comes with bulgolgi (duh), rice, seaweed salad, a croquette, and pickled onions(?). I decided to get this set since I wanted to try something besides the sushi and I wasn't disappointed. The only thing is that the meat portion seems small compared to how much rice you get. Also, the seaweed salad didn't taste as fresh as other places I have been to, but it isn't too bad.   I got the Poke bowl here since I never had one, and figured it would be appropriate to try it here. You do get a ton of fish and can choose from veggies or salad. I opted for the salad option since I wanted a healthier option. The only gripe I have about this dish is they really drenched it with a lot of sauce. There was a bunch of flavor, but I got kinda sick halfway through my meal since my dish was literally swimming in the sauce lol...I'm not sure if it is like this in other places so I will have to update this post once I get more experience with this dish.   This is a must try place if you are in the area!",

Sometimes you just have want a sushi roll or two without committing to AYCE. I got the box with the Korean BBQ, which was marinated sliced beef. It came with some pretty good sides like seaweed salad, egg, and goroke (a croquette made with some kabocha squash and potato). The sushi is legit here, it's fresh and tasty. My favorites are the lemon roll and jackpot roll. Customer service is very friendly and the owners took time to chat and get feedback, which is always a nice touch. There are even snacks to go like instant ramen bowls, rice balls, and some candy.   *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 39/100",

I also got some edamame. It was super cheap and I got so much for my money. I honestly could not believe that the Spicy Tuna was only 3.95 and it was so big. The rolls were large and delicious.

This is perfect for your time constrained lunches or if you're too hungry and don't want to sit in a restaurant and wait.  I've ordered take out three times. Once through Eat24 and the other two times, I called in. I tried to get there before my order was finished the last time I called and I couldn't beat them. The quality wasn't sacrificed despite the speed with neatly made rolls and fresh fish with every order. I usually get the poke or a box and the rest of the family will split a bunch of basic rolls. The boxes have plenty of food which include rice, egg, seaweed salad, and korroke (potato croquette).The food has been good every time with the only slip up being the rice being too wet and mushy with one order. But in the end, you'll be pleased with the amount of food you get for the price you pay.  There can be a little bit of a language barrier if you call in your order. There's plenty of seating if you decide to eat there. The restaurant is clean with an open kitchen. And all of the guys working there are super friendly. They repeat the order completely before you leave and they had no issue abiding by my request for extra ginger after the order was finished. I didn't have the bow count meter on when I last stopped in, but I think I hit about 6 bows to the fine gentleman at the register when I last picked up my order.",

    "text": "After reading a few of the reviews I decided to take my little brother who was visiting in to try some sushi. He is super picky like me but I knew we would find some stuff we both liked. When we walked in there was only one person who had ordered takeout. It was on a Monday around 2pm. The host was very welcoming and told us to sit where ever we liked. We took our seats and started looking at the menu. They have a pretty good variety of items at a really decent price. Our waitress/host came back to take our drink order, we both ordered fountain drinks which we could have poured ourselves but she insisted on doing it for us. When she brought our drinks over she asked my brother to taste his because it looked flat. It was indeed so she instead brought him over a canned soda. I felt that was a step above what most places would do. We ended up ordering an appetizer and 4 rolls. Everything was absolutely amazing! The rolls were perfect and tasted so fresh. The service was great and the price could not be beat. In CA my husband and I had a place we would go to regularly and never left paying under $40 (not including tip) our order was pretty similar to what my brother and I ordered here. The price we paid at Sushi Cafe was only $22.95 (again not including tip) that is a huge price difference for basically the same meal! I am totally going to bring my husband here! If you like quality food and good service you need to check this place out.",

Their sushi is excellent and their other dishes (including poki and sashimi) follow suit. Over the last 8 months they have done some serious remodeling and I am in LOVE! It's not just the scenery it's the service. It's more like a restaurant now, service wise, and the atmosphere is borderline \"hipster coffee shop\". 12/10 would recommend to a friend!",

There's even noodles you can buy and a hot water dispenser for it. Everything is in plastic containers to easily go or be tossed. The cashier was very friendly and came around to check on the guests.  I got the poke bowl. You get a lot for your money. I couldn't even put a dent in it. I took the rest home. The bowl isn't simple with just poke and rice. There's also salad, avocado, ginger, imitation crab, and all these little things to add more flavor to every bite. There was something spicy in it so if you can't handle hot, beware.  Overall, I like this place. I will be back. Great lunch spot. The cashier was nice enough to give us a free dessert. Thank you!",

We were warmly greeted upon walking into the squeaky clean and inviting restaurant. The man taking our order was patient with my questions and was very kind.   We ordered and waited a very short time for our food. The sushi was hand rolled and organically cut so the pieces were bigger than we were accustomed to, but in the best way possible. We got a little of everything to try, and we're not let down. The fish was fresh, the presentation was beautiful, and the price was very fair and comparable to other sushi spots nearby, but you get way more bang for your buck here.   I would definitely urge you to stop in! It's an absolutely worthwhile place to try.",

The Edamame beans were perfect with some delicious kosher sea salt.     You will not be disappointed.  If your experience will be anything like ours, you'll be very glad you came.

We received our food super fast which usually affects quality BUT this place proved that wrong! Quality was great and the sushi was fresh. Service is amazing, which always brings us back to places. The owners/sushi chefs were also friendly, funny, and talked to us about their menu and concept! We can tell these guys are dedicated and this will be a new place to grab a quick, quality piece of sushi when we're hungry!!!!!! Awesome jobs guys!!!!   Ps. We expect the flower every time we eat here now ;)",

    "text": "Hmmmm. If I did this review back during my first visit, it would be 5 stars.. but they've changed..  About a year ago, a Monster Box was a Sushi burrito, 4 pieces of Nigiri, and 2 potstickers for $9.99.. Fast forward to about 6 months ago, and the sushi burrito was $9.99 alone, with the Monster box coming in at $13 or so. That's cool. Inflation. I come in 2 weeks ago, and asked for the Monster Box. The lady who's ALWAYS at the register (more on her later), said they don't have that anymore, but she'll \"hook me up with it as a special.\" She rang me up. Came to over $16. She just charged me regular prices for all 3 items. That THREE price changes in less than a year. Not cool. Not consistent.  Back to the lady. I understand she has to sell people on their product but she's literally borderline harassing. Twice in the past few months, me and my ex visited and she pushes and pushes and pushes their special rolls. Even after you tell her no, not interested, she walks by asking, \"Are you sure?\" ...and even walked someone else's special roll past us to show us. We finally ordered it to shut her up. It was AMAZING! ..but that's besides the point. I eat sushi all over the country. Never am I pressured EVERY time I go. Even when ordering the Monster Box to go, she tries to get you to get the special. It's really annoying.  Will I be back? Yep. I'm leaving here right now actually. Would I come a lot more if they had consistent pricing and the lady at front had a muzzle? Absolutely.  Also: Call ahead. Twice in the past year, they were closed without notice, even though Store Hours sign said open..",

We stopped by for dinner on a Monday evening. There was no one else there, so we were seated immediately.  We'd been here before, but it seems many things have changed.  Their menu is basically useless. There are no descriptions at all about what is in the dishes/rolls. And, unfortunately, our server's mastery of English was not good enough to explain what was in the food. They've also listed some roll names on their chalkboards, but again, no explanation of what they are and no prices.  Ultimately, our food was just okay. There are other restaurants nearby with equal or better quality food where you know exactly what you are ordering. Unless they fix this critical problem I think Sushi Cafe might be in for tough times ahead.",

I had to take up this area good for 4 persons at a table. They have a back patio decor combined with Asian accents. Lighting is great along with the fixtures. I see that they have a sushi bar not in use and they should install bar stools along the counter. They can open up that concept to make the experience personal with the sushi chef.    I took a picture of the menu, so you could find it in the photos to pick out your options.   Personally, I ordered the Bulgogi Box $9.00 which comes complete with rice, seaweed salad and tamago. I also added a shrimp tempura appetizer.   My friends all did sushi roll orders that start at $5.95   The owner of the cafe complimented our lunch with a free waffle mochi ice cream w/ red bean paste and strawberry syrup toppings. He made our experience feel like top class!",

We decided to meet near where he was staying, which is how we all ended up at the Sushi Cafe in Henderson. Naturally, he previewed the restaurant and noticed it had really good reviews. Considering he lives in San Francisco and loves sushi, this was all the convincing I needed.  The Sushi Cafe is in an interesting location in a strip mall, and it's nicely decorated. Right away, our group felt very comfortable in a clean, modern dining room that was nearly half full. Our server was very kind and took the time to answer our questions. I regret that I don't remember her name.  Most of those in our group chose either the Bulgogi or Spicy Pork boxes. My brother took his own road and selected the Dragon Roll and Edamame. Everyone present enjoyed their meals. And my verdict is this: These are the BEST pot stickers I have ever tried, anywhere!  The next time I'm in Vegas, I'm getting off the freeway at the Stephanie Street exit. Thank you!",

We ordered the tempura philly roll, spicy crawfish, another roll that I can't remember, and the egg rolls.   First off, everything was cooked to order and tasted super fresh! The sushi came in like 8 slices per roll- so much food. I really enjoyed my Philly and hubby lived both his rolls, but he REALLY loved the spicy crawfish.   Not only was the sushi really great, but the prices were so reasonable!! I mean we're used to paying $13+ for a basic 6 piece roll in LA Our total bill came out to $36 and we had leftovers.... WINNING!!!  The woman who worked here (assuming the owner?) was super sweet and attentive, but not in an annoying way. I can't wait to move to Henderson in the next month and a half, because this will def be our go to sushi spot!!",

    "text": "They have Bento Boxes, Poki, Sushi Burritos as well as sushi?  Unexpected extra offerings everywhere.  I like mashups in songs and comic books when done correctly.  I was hopeful on my first visit on a Saturday afternoon at 12 PMish.    Service: 3/5 They had only 3 employees total working this visit.  It appeared to be one manager, one Chef/Server and one hostess/server all trying to take care of a pretty busy lunch crowd.  They did their best but I had to ask for a refill and took awhile to find someone to get the check.  They were very friendly and they're 1 FTE from a smooth running place on this visit  Food: 4/5 Pleasantly surprised with variety of offerings.  I'm on this Bento Box trip so I went the Bulgogi Box which came with: rice, seaweed salad, tamago and gyoza.  Bulgogi was very tasty and everything else was up to par.  I noticed that you can order 2 pieces of Nigiri and fired away with the: yellowtail, Smelt Egg and the White Tuna.  Great quality for the p.rice which is coming up.  Value: 5/5 Bulgogi Box was $9.95 of amazing value.  Going to be doing a tour of all the boxes they offer on my next visits.  The Nigiri was $2.95 for 2 pieces which worked out perfectly as it allowed me to pick and choose and keep things relatively cheap while getting relatively full.  I'm looking forward to trying the Monster Box which is a Sushit Burrito with 5 pieces of Nigiri for $9.95.  Ambiance: 3.5 The tables seem to be made from some kind of old gate door with multiple planks of wood? Looks cool, but makes the table uneven.  No biggie.  Plenty of seating but this might be one of those places where I'll be ordering for pickup vs eating in.  Summary: A one stop place for Bento Boxes, Sushi (Nigiri and Rolls), Poki, and Sushi Burritos.  The offerings are extra af and I'm stoked to find this place.  I'll keep updating reviews as I keep trying new things. Good times coming. =)",

We had to ask a couple times for our drinks which was water, there was no utensils out unless we asked, it took our food so long to get to our table. We were in there for about 2 hours and still the only ones inside. I also needed a spoon and I tried multiple times do get the servers attention, but he was doing playful handshakes with the chef in the cook area.

    "text": "Seems like their menu got cut short.   I was craving for some sushi burrito and/or Korean fried chicken and since I am on a lunch break and this is the closest place to go I decided to come here. Walked in and went straight to the counter and I was given the menu expecting to order their lunch menu sushiritto and 5 (?) sushi combo. Apparently they no longer have this so I was a little disappointed. I asked if they have the KFC as well but they did not have it.   I opted to order the bulgogi plate (~$10+) to go thinking that it would be tiny based on other people's photos. Opening it back in the office I was greeted by a cup of rice, seaweed salad, tamago , some dumplings and the bulgogi.  Rice was done well, seaweed was not too dry or salty, but I wish I didn't get the cucumbers under it, the tamago was sweet, but dumplings was alright. The bulgogi though... I've had better. It wasn't badddd per se but it was just...bulgogi. What I usually see people get wrong is that the meat gets really hard and dry but Sushi Cafe didn't have that. The juices also seeps down and kind of mix in with the rice which I have no complaints about. I would suggest less... purple cabbage(?) as it had a very bitter taste to it... but that's just me. Kimchi would be nice toooo!  All in all, I think I loved the seaweed the most. Will definitely need to try out the sushiritto later though.",

My server was Shizuka and if you get her you are lucky.  She knows her stuff!  The price range was perfect--not expensive and perfect portion sizes.  The food itself was worth the five stars alone.  The fried rice was light and full of flavor, and at the same time was not too oily.  The gyoza was cooked the right way and made on site, which was easy to tell by the balance of sight, texture and flavor. Hands down the best gyoza I've had at a restaurant in Vegas.   Food was hot and fresh and beer was nice and cold.  I anticipate trying the ramen next time; I just did not have that much of an appetite today.   I will be returning here from now on.  Perfect spot for a lunch or happy hour break!!",

The imitation crab meat they use is also sloppy and the ahi was just slapped on top of the Hawaiian roll but overall the presentation was awful. I've never not wanted to post a picture of my sushi, but this was a first. The fried tempura rolls were equally awful and overly thick. The nigiri squid and octopus sushi was still partially frozen when it was served. The best thing about this restaurant was the green tea and that was still served to me in the can with a straw. Bathroom was disgusting and the place just felt filthy overall. Stained seats and tables cluttered with dishes long after patrons had left. I'm from Hawaii and have had sushi in Japan, California, as well as many other states and countries and this place was by far the worst. I was lured here by the solid 4.5 star reviews and am now convinced that the people of Henderson, Nevada will never know or taste good sushi and the quality of service and cleanliness that the Japanese are known for. Never again!",

Everything is top quality (even the sashimi), but the lemon roll is insane and you MUST get it. Do yourself a favor and stop eating bad grocery store sushi when you are in a rush - go here!",

Yesterday was a completely different experience. Went at noon on a Friday and there was only one other table with customers. I was waiting for a friend, so the \"server\" thought I was alone and brought one menu. Didn't ask about a beverage.  When my friend arrived, the server brought another menu and asked about beverages. We asked for two waters and I ordered a green apple slush. For some reason I thought it might be made with real fruit. When it FINALLY arrived, 15 minutes later, I realized it was a prepackaged icee. Which promptly spilled all over while opening. We looked for a server for napkins and when we couldn't find help, we had to get up and find napkins ourselves.  Once we finally ordered (from a server that barely said a word; maybe didn't speak English?) it took another 20 minutes for our small order of 3 items.  The food is good, but with so many other sushi places to choose from, I will not return to this restaurant.",

The milk tea is fantastic and an XL is only $5.50 and you get so much more than anywhere else for the same price. Salmon nigiri is my favorite and here you get 2 for 3.50 which is an absolute steal. At first I was worried because when sushi is too cheap, you worry about getting sick but it was actually decent quality and tastes super yummy too. The people here are also super sweet but the only thing is that they do take a long time to prepare the food. I always order pickup tho and I call way ahead of time so this doesn't really bother me. I will definitely be a regular here whenever I have my sushi cravings :)",

That way I wasn't too indecisive on what to get. Sometimes other sushi places have so many specialty rolls that I honestly would not know what to order.   The place was pretty quiet when we get there, but ppl started coming for dinner rush. The staff was pretty attentive, they come back a few times to clear out our plates and refill our water.   The rolls that I got was not too bad but it wasn't super good either. My favorite is the jalapeno poppers from their appetizer menu. I tried out the golden California roll and the spicy tuna roll. My husband got the rollito (?), their sushi burrito essentially. It wasn't too bad and the size was pretty big. I'll go back next time if I'm craving sushi but don't want to get ayce sushi.",

The last two times I've been here the usual lady that takes my order has been in the back sleeping -and the wait staff doesn't speak English. Which wouldn't be that big of a problem, but if you have any questions or ask any specific things...there's a language barrier. Very frustrating when you're hungry and the guy keeps smiling and nodding but has no clue what you're asking.  Last time they put mixed greens that were warm and wilted in my sushi...gross.  This time they ended up waking the lady in the back room and we were able to order. But three things still came out wrong!! One thing was never brought out. And yet they did nothing to fix it nor adjust the bill.  Not a good experience at all. Won't be coming here again.",

Food: 5  *** All boxes come with seaweed salad, sliced cucumbers, rice, and 2 beef gyozas.  Fried Fish Box: The box comes with a big fish fillet covered in thick, crisp batter. Th fish itself is moist. There's an additional mixed spring salad along with the other items in a normal box.  Bulgogi Box: The beef is sauteed with onions. The beef was surprisingly tender despite seemingly lean. The sauce was slightly sweet, but it paired well with the seaweed salad and cucumbers.  Shrimp Tempura Roll: This was a standard roll with shrimp tempura, avocados, and cucumber. I loved the tempura flakes that covered the top of the roll. It was rolled a tad looser than I would like.  Service: 5  Our waitress was the owner's daughter. She was nice and pretty professional. The food did take a bit of time to come out (~15 mins), but it was clear that the food was made to order because it all comes out piping hot.  Ambiance: 4.5  The cafe is small and cute. There's a lot of interesting little decorations. I also like that you can see them making some of the food. My only gripe is that the bathroom is a little run down and jarringly different from the rest of the cafe.",

A couple mins goes by and nothing at all so we stood up to order our items ourselves. He rings everything up and I hand him a $20 bill. The total came out to around $17.   He tells us to give him a minute and so we did, he comes back and explains to us that he does not have $3 or even the exact change to give us in return. Obviously as customers, we really didn't know what to do.   We completely cancelled the order & asked for our $20 bill back and walked out.   It completely ruined our experience and I'm pretty sure we won't back to try this place out.",

The staff are very friendly but we did encounter issues such as missing some of our order to getting some of the items we ordered very late to the point that we forgot about it. The food however has always been and is still very delicious.",

    "text": "A great addition to the eateries littered all over Stephanie St over here in Henderson. I am literally 5 minutes away from this place and could not be more happy about it opening. It's a fast/casual sushi restaurant which is a nice sight to see in the LV sea of AYCE sushi joints.   I've been here several times since Celina C. recommended it to me and I'm sure I will be back to satisfy that sushi craving that many of us get. I've gotten the Monster Box w/ kalbi roll, 5 pieces of nigiri, seaweed salad and potato croquette for ~$10. It's a pretty solid deal with a good amount of food.   I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the fish on the nigiri. It was pretty good and fresh. Was it the BEST sushi I've ever tasted? No, but it's excellent value for what it is. I will have to come in again soon to try the POKE (They spell in 'poki' and it bothers me to no end. Us Hawaii folk know what's up, right?)  There is tons of parking in front of the restaurant and a good amount of seating inside the restaurant as well. I'm hoping this place picks up in business and sustains itself.",

    "text": "I'm hardly ever on this side of town (Henderson), so I really had no clue on what grub was yay or nay for the area. My brother suggested this place, as I said I was craving some seafood. It's a cute little spot located in a not too busy shopping plaza. Walking in, my sis and I thought you walk up to the counter to order, so we sat our stuff down at a table. The gal working the counter quickly approached us with menus and said she would be right with us. She was helping some people standing by the counter (they were reading the wall menus). We ordered a beef bulgogi box which came with rice, seaweed salad, tamago and pickled veg. Also with our order was a miso soup, tuna poke and poke bowl (half ahi and half white fish). I felt like the bulgogi was a little on the dry side and wasn't as flavorful as other bulgogi dishes I've had in the past. I believe the tuna poke, for the price, was lacking in amount. The quality of the fish was excellent! The miso soup was basic and satisfying and the poke bowl was huuuuuuge. Yummy and HUGE. Just a heads up, the poke bowl came with a set variation of toppings and sauce. I'm sure it could be customizable, but I didn't bother to ask. I didn't mind, everything about that poke bowl was perfection! PS, skip the edamame.",

But, if you have the time, I would definitely come here if you want an affordable sushi lunch. I was so sad for awhile when they were closed =(  I like to get the monster box with a tuna monster roll. It also comes with 5 pieces of nigeri (tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail and white fish). All of that for $10! It's a great deal and the fish is pretty good- not the best but what do you expect for $10?? The monster box used to be better though too.. it used to come with the fried potato which is delicious.. I was a little disappointed to see that not offered with the box anymore, but still a great place and deal for a sushi lunch.",

Saw my Niece post a review about this and was shocked! I never heard of it...I never even knew it existed. Raved about it all last week to my coworkers and we finally went there for lunch today. I couldn't be more satisfied! We got the monster roll box. Different types and all were delicious! For $10.77, you get your money worth and it's excellent sushi I may add. Fish was fresh! Monster box came with a monster sushi (sushi burrito), 5 piece of sushi (diff fish) and two fried mashed potato tempura (don't know the name) but that was good. It's mash potato and mashed sweet potato deep fried! HEAVEN! Staff was nice and friendly. Answered all our questions. Place was spacious and clean. Prices are more than affordable! This is a must try place. Only two downfall was it was hot inside. They had a big fan blowing but not sure if the AC was not fully working or what. Also, I would recommend to add more spicy mayo. We had 3 different monster rolls (sushi burritos) and all lacked spicy mayo but still amazing flavors.",

This is seriously the BEST tuna bowl ever. No joke. I felt it was very spicy. But itms me, i cant handle spicy. But it didnt matter i ate it all. It was huge. This guys don't disappoint. Everything i had so far has been excellent! The other day i had one meal that was like a burrito and it was delicious.  One thing i love is that is very casual.

Just to mention, this was not our first choice on our list of Asian/sushi places. I settled with Sushi Cafe when I wasn't able to drive all the way to another sushi place on south eastern. It was close enough to be convenient and new enough to try it out.  After giving it a chance, I'm thoroughly impressed and much happier than I would have been at the other place. It'll be my definite go-to place for quick and good quality food, plus the friendly service is a bonus.  They also sell some authentic Asian desserts/snacks and drinks like cheesecake, pocky, calpico, tea, and hello panda.  I will definitely come back for more!",

Great deal that delivery is free with $30 minimum order. You can get quite a bit for your money, tip your driver, and still come in under $40. I mostly order sushi, so the experience might be different for someone who prefers elaborate rolls or hot food. For my preferences, it is fast and the right price at a level of quality I find more than acceptable.",

They seriously need pictures in their menu!  Prices were decent, however, I was just not digging the sushi burrito.  It is so Americanized (bad thing), like rice and salad, with a little fish all rolled into one.  Filling yes, but not satisfying (ie not enough fish).  I suppose I prefer classic style Japanese sushi.",

First thought going inside, is how comfy and cute the place is! There's plenty of tables to sit if an influx of customers come in all at once! They have a cute waiting area too, if you're a customer ordering to go. The menu was small and simple, and everything was priced fairly well! We ordered one bulgogi box, a lemon roll, a red dragon roll, a tiger roll and a caterpillar roll for under $50. Safe to say, we were both full and satisfied with our meal! I will definitely be coming back here again, for either a light lunch or heavy dinner! The service was great to boot!",

I come here about once a week. They have recently renovated the tables and seating, with comfy couches and larger group seating. My only gripe is that the restaurant used to be a order-at-cashier spot, and now its more of a formal sit-down environment. However, we usually place our orders over the phone on the way there.

The first time I ordered a Korean BBQ bento box and it was good, the meat was very tender and had  great sauce . The second time the meat was inedible, their was no sauce and the meat quality was downright horrible. I like to give everyone a chance but this place is going to have to step up if they are going to make it in this transit town. Their menu needs to be more descriptive. I didn't dare order something I had no idea of what it was. Their are too many sushi spots in town to have low quality sushi. The prices are good because your not getting the top quality, I would compare their sushi rolls to supermarkets like Smiths/Albertsons. You need to be consistent to stay in business as a new business,   Their are plenty of sushi spots in the Valley but most are average. I hope this place gets their act together as far as their quality in meat goes or else they won't make it out here :/",

The meet was so chewy, that instead of wasting it, I gave it to Dolce, my adorable doggie.  She seems to love it, unfortunately, I am the one writing the review. -The 4 piece nigiri are: shrimp, tuna, salmon, and another piece of I don't remember as they were all not good grade as they were chewy as well.  Didn't give this to Dolce as I don't know how she will react to this. -The potato croquettes were yummy though. -Seaweed salad - decent  Hubby's Sashimi Salad - not the traditional slices of sashimi you would find at other Sushi restaurant...they just topped the greens with poke style sashimi.  We didn't dig it very much.  Conclusion:  Fast take out place, but we will not be ordering from here again.",

So far, it's only been open for a couple of days, and after trying it out, it's a decent place to go for a quick meal.  Sushi Cafe is right about next to Henry's American Grill. It's a small little shop, but is bright, clean, and very well maintained. It has a modern feel. After being explained the concept, I was intrigued.  This place is going for the fast, casual eatery. They are going for various boxes which include meats, seafood, and other items. They are also going for a different style of food where they are pairing some Asian ingredients with panini's. You can also order nigiri and sushi rolls by themselves. I ordered a monster box, which included a roll, and 4pcs of nigiri.  I ordered the Korean BBQ roll box which came with 4pcs of nigiri. I thought it was alright. Nothing stood out in bad way. It was a quick casual meal and how I thought would be expected. It was a decent meal.  Originally, I was going to give the food here 3.5 stars, but I rounded up with the really great service and value for what I received. Definitely different when it comes to their contemporaries like Zupas and Panera, but different in a good way.",

The guy who works the front was so nice he came up to us to talk story and tell us the concept of their restaurant. He said they will soonbe delivering at NO EXTRA CHARGE within a 3 mile radius real soon also. As we were walking out, he gave us red bean mochi for free! How nice is that?!? Either way, great place!",

If you are craving sushi, just stop by and grab fresh and delicious food at sushi cafe! It was my first time visiting.  The staff is very friendly.  I'll definitely go back there with my friends for brunch and my family for a quick lunch or dinner!  Tip:  order first, pay the cashier, then find a seat.    Pro : it's cheaper than I expected and it is a decent amount of food. It's very Clean!!! They put all the food in the container box so you can just eat and bring the rest home. The menu consist of Popular sushi  and Korean food. Delicious dessert (like green tea cheesecake.)   Con :  It can be difficult to find. (It's behind auto zone) There is no table service or alcohol.",

    "text": "tl;dr THE IMO KOROKKE THOUGH.   Since I left DFW I've been trying to find somewhere to fill the void Sushi Robata left in my soul. Sushi Cafe comes damn close.   The prices are the best I've seen pretty much ever, I think. The menu isn't huge, but it covers the bases. ALSO IMO KOROKKE. It's so hard to find anywhere that does korokke at all, much less somewhere that does them... better than Robata?! The potatoes are so buttery and smooth, and the panko is done well too. The korokke comes with a mysterious orange sauce here, no idea what it's called. It's like a spicy mayo but with a little more heft to it.   I got the crunch shrimp tempura roll and the red dragon roll. My only criticism is that the eel sauce on the red dragon roll was a little heavy handed, but not a big deal at all. It did leak over into my tempura roll, but whatever.   They also have some desserts in a fridge case - matcha cheesecake and castella cake, which is basically a sponge cake. The castella is packaged in two slices of slightly different appearance, and I'm not sure of the difference. There's also some instant ramen bowls available, like Shin Bowl, and the odd matcha Pocky and Hi-Chew sorts of snacks.   Another reviewer mentioned getting ill after having their order delivered. I noticed at the end of my tempura roll, after it had cooled down a bit, that something did taste a little iffy with the room-temperature tempura combined with the eel sauce. If you're getting delivery (and this applies to any sushi place in my opinion), make sure all the sauces are on the side, and don't get anything meant to be eaten piping hot. The korokke might be okay since potatoes hold heat well, but I'd keep the sushi to the cold-only variations.",

They do not have waiters or waitresses, to help keep overhead costs down, & with what they save they are able to buy you Fresh grade sushi right from a Japanese Vendor, & (let's not kid ourselves) who knows fish better than those who created \"Sushi?\" ...when one eats sushi, 1st question you should ask restaurant is, \"where do you get your fish?\" ...very important question, to avoid Mercury, food poisoning, etc! Oh, & they cater too!!! I would recommend to anyone who loves sushi but don't want to spend loads of cash downtown on expensive restaurants just to get fresh sushi! & the owners are so friendly!!!!",

Very nice people, good service, and most of all the freshest, most imaginative and creative sushi presentation in this area. I really didn't expect much, so I was thrilled at how luscious my lunch - got the Monster Box  - was. Actually, there was only one glitch: almost too much food! (How bad can that be, right?) Strangely (or not so strangely) I was able - or should I say willing - to get it all down and I was happily stuffed as I left the restaurant. Of course, sushi being sushi, it was all good. It's a healthy way to fill up. Just wonderful. Don't miss out on this one. Let's make it a super popular spot so that it will stay with us for a long time. Thanks for the great meal! Oh, and by the way, the place has a nice atmosphere, very minimalist, gleaming wood tables, so clean and pleasant. And quiet. That's a big one for me. I hate noisy restaurants.",
