    "text": "Recommended by Lisa C. and Jacob H. ... came here for lunch during my Yelp Spring Break weekend  and all i have to say is WOW, so good! Lunch price is $22, Dinner is $27.  AYCE nigiri, sushi rolls, appetizers, side dishes, and desserts! The fish was fresh and the service was pretty fast. The day we were there, they had salmon belly nigiri.. oh man, i don't know how many pieces I have ate.   onto the dessert, we had a choice of fried ice cream, black sesame mochi, lychee sorbet, and green tea ice cream. The lychee sorbet was so refreshing! the fragrance of the lychee was just unbelievably good! Each bite i took was so delicious, and it had lychee jelly in them too! I had two of this dessert .. i could have eaten extra scoops if i wanted to... but i stopped myself, cuz i shouldn't be greedy. Gotta let other customers have some! Man, thinking about it now is making me salivate. I want to go back!   If you come during dinner, they also have many more special side / appetizers dishes and sushi.  Also you'll get to order uni and sweet shrimp!   Although it is a little out of the way from the Las Vegas Strip, i wouldnt mind visiting Sushi Mon again. Maybe I'll come here on the way to vegas before i check in ... or on the way back home.  Nonetheless, Sushi Mon, YOU will see me again! Next time.. it'll be for dinner!",

I have this dream of this amazing bento box but I dont think it exists. I love the idea of a bento box, but I havent found one that blows me away.  So, if you come here for the AYCE, I can't vouch for it. I generally dont do AYCE. I have a few pieces, and I'm set. Both times we were seated quickly and food was quick too.",

    "text": "I came to this location instead of Sahara because I figure the original is usually better than the other locations. This place left so much to be desired. I had high hopes from the the reviews but I can't. Be forewarned that I'm a visual person when it comes to food. The fish cuts were poor and the rolls broken and not well formed. I did not like the Futomaki but it's my fault for not reading it thoroughly. Unfortunately the rolls didn't live much to its hype either as they were all overpowered by one component or sauce. The only thing that really tasted good was the salmon belly(despite its poor presentation). But the super white tuna was great!! Other than this, the pricing was spot on for AYCE; $22 for lunch and $27 for dinner. Service and cleanliness are a thumbs up. But other than that, not enough for me to return. Sorry Sushi Mon.",

Our seat at the bar placed us right in front of our sushi chef, who made our orders fresh right when we ordered it. All the nigiri we ordered tasted great -- especially the seared ahi tuna and the super white tuna. The cut rolls were delicious, especially for an AYCE place. We also tackled the Sushi Monster Roll -- a roll cut into 5 pieces, which is the size of your palm. It takes a while to make so order that first over the nigiri rolls and other rolls so that you aren't waiting a while for it. However, one thing we didn't realize was that everything under the 5-piece roll section are just as big as the Sushi Monster Roll. We ordered the spider roll and that was super huge too!   The AYCE menu also includes side orders, such as edamame and gyoza, as well as dessert. After all the sushi, I ended my meal with a bowl of creamy green tea ice cream (they also have tempura ice cream, but that would've been too much after all the food I ate). Great food, great price, great place! Sushi-mon is on my list of places to go every time I'm in Vegas.",

I've introduced many of my friends from So Cal and they always make a special trip out here when they are in town.  The fish is fresh and the cuts are amazing.  Very friendly service each time and they don't balk if you go over you 1 hour.  I highly recommend this place and I'm upgrading it to 5 stars because of the consistency of the staff, food and portions each time I come to Sushi Mon.  I has not changed in the 1 1/2 year that I've been coming.  Keep up the great work.  **Not to mention they have a frequent eater card, buy 10 get 1 free**",

Only the extra half because the first time I ate there, I got a very nice lunch special with a good variety and everything tasted fresh. But we went back for AYCE and it was pretty bad.   The sushi chef seemed new, the cuts to the nigiri were amateurish and he was veeeeery slow, despite having parts, like the California roll, the basis of most of their rolls, pre-made. Nothing tasted fresh and we actually sent a roll back because it tasted really fishy. That was spicy tuna.   If I ever go back, and it would be shocking if I did, I will stick with the lunch specials.",

No complaints on the hand roll and the rock 'n roll I ordered, but a note on the edamame: it was dried out and pruny, with way too much salt on top. It looked like they baked it instead of steaming or boiling it! Just a small annoyance, but it took down the overall experience, especially as I love my edamame.",

    "text": "I've been to Sushi Mon many times before and I feel like each time I go I'm more disappointed. I used to love Sushi Mon and would tell everyone it was the best sushi  spot around. However, the past few times I've gone the quality has not been as great as it used to and the service isn't that wonderful either.   I went with a friend last night and we waited over 40 minutes to be sat. That isn't too unusual for Sushi Mon and before I never minded the wait. However, sushi mon has a website where you can check who is next on the wait list. When we were next to be sat, a party of four was sat down before us and then we were sat shortly after. Not a big deal, but a host should always follow the list. Especially when we had been waiting beyond our quoted time. The server, Claire, also took the order of the table next to us before taking ours. She waited approximately 10 minutes to come take our order and was extremely rude to us when she came to our table. In the middle of our order for AYCE she said \"okay is that enough for first round?\" Even though the table next to us had ordered far more she never asked them if they were done ordering. Once we ordered our food it took a very long time for it to come out even though the table next to ours who she clearly favored got their food shortly after placing their order.   The sushi was alright, definitely not as good as it used to be. I found the presentation of the sushi to be sloppy and inconsistent. So with the average sushi and poor service it's safe to say that after being a very loyal Sushi Mon customer I'm not sure if I'll be returning.",

    "text": "Came here for the $10 AYCE sushi event for Sushimon's 10 year anniversary and it was awesome.  The fish was good and they were ultra-fast!  We ordered 4 orders of 6 types of nigiri and it was sitting on our table in 5 minutes tops.  I really enjoyed the garlic tuna nigiri and the cajun albacore nigiri and make it one of my frequent orders that day.  Didn't want to order any rolls because I was more focused on hitting up the nigiri and making sure to get my monthly nigiri fix.  My buddy ordered 5-6 orders of uni sushi (usually one order per person at other sushi spots) as well and got it just as fast as I did!  The food was pretty fresh and my group and I left super full from definitely stuffing ourselves with all the yummyness we could.  On a side note, we had to wait for 4 hours, but with the AYCE price this low and one hour of AYCE madness, I wasn't suprised or mad BECAUSE IT'S $10 DOLLARS!!  Just because some people don't have patience and/or didn't make an effort to come down earlier does NOT mean that Sushimon deserves a 1-star for not catering to you.  They took the price cut to give the public a nice treat and were simply overwhelmed with the response.  Yet, they turned up the production to 11 and kept the event going as best as they could.  No one was entitled to the $10 AYCE price and I definitely didn't feel like I was.  I came in as soon as possible, waited my turn, and got to enjoy the event as intended.  I give them 5 stars for dropping their price low, good foods, and giving us the best service they could while dealing with snooty ungrateful people.  Definitely stopping by again; Sushimon has made a customer out of me.",

This Thursday night it looked like they had large party so we stood at the door for about 5 minutes waiting patiently & no one acknowledged us. So after a while my hubby see see to open tables at the bar & so we decide to sit. They bring our drinks, we put in an order & after about 10 minutes one of the servers come over & asks us who sat us. My husband was like we did. Now at this point we've been seated for about 10 minutes & I need a refill on my water. The server tells us that we have to get up because there is a waiting list. While this is going on the people behind us were also arguing with a different server because they sat their party on a table that does not really fit his party. Anyway, my hubby is asking the guy if he's serious. The server looks at the owner and says yes but we can add you to the waiting list. My mouth completely dropped.  I could not believe as we are enjoying our dinner they want us to stop & step out but still want us to come back. We will never come back. Never did they say sorry. We are so unbelievably shocked at their service & attitude we will never go back!!!!! My husband has just about told the story to everyone he knows!! He's in sales & it's now a part of every conversation he has. It's too bad. I use to like it there. And the only reason I'm giving one star is because I USE TO like it there!!! Shame on them",

Everything is superb from the minute you walk in the door until you leave,  full and satisfied. Amazing side dishes and creative delicious rolls make for a super combo your taste buds will thank you for! My favorite is called \"crispy rice\". I will always be a fan.  Thank you sushi mon",

    "text": "There are so many AYCE sushi places in Vegas and quite a few of them are VERY good.  Sushi Mon might not be as pretty, spacious, or friendly as some of the other spots around town but they definitely come through on the food.  Especially the specials.  The other night they had an amazing sashimi salad on the AYCE specials board.  The Striped Jack was so tasty and definitely not something you find at most of the AYCE places around town.  They had salmon belly and yellowtail belly on the specials board too.  AYCE Salmon Belly?  So yummy!!!  The nigiri was all fresh and flavorful.  I really like that they don't go heavy on the sauces that mask the fish flavors.   Another favorite is their Salmon Collar.  A lot of places around town over cook their collar.  Sushi Mon's is always moist, lightly charred, and absolutely delicious!  They don't have a lot of dessert options but then I never have any space left.  And depending on what time you go, there may be a long wait.  We got there at 6pm on Friday and had a half hour wait, people who came just after us were told the wait was going on an hour.  Still, I give them 5 stars, and we drive past three other really good AYCE options on the way here.",

    "text": "Yay for $13 pitchers of Sapporo!   The place was mobbed when we arrived and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The fish we had was fresh, though the cuts weren't as nice as what we get at Bluefin.    I also liked that they had various daily specials, so that you could get a small sampling of other higher-ticket  items. We were lucky and the specials were for super white tuna, fresh scallops and white clam.   We tried the tuna and scallops and they were both tasty. I loved the scallops, they were big fresh pieces and very supple.   The amaebi was a bigger portion and pretty nice. Sweet, juicy with that distinct raw-shrimp mouth-feel. Yum!    The home smoked salmon was interesting! It had bits of dill flecked on it and was smooth, subtly cooked and with a mild creamy flavor. Not as strong a flavor as in commercial smoked salmon, which could be a positive or negative depending on your preference. I liked it but wouldn't buy a large package of it.   I had masago with quail egg. The masago was was briny and sweet with nice pop and a generous portion. The egg seemed a little less fresh. The overall effect was still pleasant.    The uni was NOT as fresh as what I've had at other restaurants. There were odd discoloration marks on it, which I haven't seen anywhere else.  We got a half order of the volcano roll on a friend's recommendation and neither of us liked it. It had a lot of krab in it, which is a turn off.  An order of gyoza meant 2 little bitty pieces. The boy had those and found them unremarkable. He also had the yakitori, which came in a super heavy sauce. Not something he'd go out of his way to have again, and though the portion was small he tried to enlist my assistance in demolishing it.    I also had the miso soup with fried amaebi heads. The batter got soggy because the heads were totally submerged in the scalding-hot broth, which was disappointing. Also, the fact that the broth was a few degrees shy of boiling- miso is NOT meant to be boiled because it ruins the integrity and health benefits of the miso. The soup utilized white miso and was still flavorful once it cooled down enough to be edible without the risk of 3rd degree burns.   The ahi poke salad was very mild in flavor impact. I liked the combination of seaweeds/seaplants in it but otherwise it was forgettable.   The lychee sorbet was a refreshing option. I liked the little bits of what seemed like candied/dry lychee that I'd occasionally discover.  Overall, it was fun and we enjoyed our beer but we won't venture out of our way when we've had better luck with sushi spots closer to home.",

Sushi Mon isn't our favorite place and we figured the wait would be pretty long, but since they clearly advertised a no reservations policy we figured it would be worth it to go and wait; We were severely wrong.   When we arrived there were a few people gathered outside and the restaurant was full, but it wasn't too bad. When I went to the hostess to put our name on the list, we were informed they were booked solid until the end of their event and we couldn't be served even though our whole party was present. So much for the \"no reservations\" policy.   Save yourself the trouble, there's all-you-can-eat sushi places nearby with better flavor and similar prices--we won't be returning.",

But this place is well worth the wait (which by the way was only 20 min on a Friday at 630) At Sushi-Mon all you can eat, you can order two or 4 or 8 of anything and everything.  I tried things I have never tried before, you see it and if it looks good to you  try it, if you like it you order more what a great concept.  Not to mention everything is delicious!!! Right down to the desserts, again order them all if you want.  The staff is very  friendly and helpful, it is a dinning EXPERIENC I cannot wait to go back again!",

There is still a lunch and dinner pricing. I don't remember what the dinner price was but for lunch on Sunday it was $22. They also don't give you a paper to write down your order, there's a server that comes to take your order.   There is a lot of things to choose from in their menu. My group got a few rolls and then mainly stuck to nigiri the rest of the time. Don't forget to look at the daily special menu because that is included as well!   The sushi that definitely stuck out to me and was soooooo good were the fresh scallops, negi toro and the blue fin toro. I have no idea what was on the fresh scallops but it was my favorite! I could've kept eating that for the entire time! For their special rolls the ecstasy roll was BOMB. Def recommend trying those 4.  They also have really good desserts! A variety of different flavors for their mochi ice cream and the lychee sorbet was AMAZING!  Service wasn't bad. Well at the beginning service was great but towards the end of our meal it kind of got pretty slow but we didn't mind it.   I will definitely be back here on my next visit to Vegas!",

Chicken was burnt/tasted bitter, sushi had uneven amounts of rice and was falling apart, salad was pretty salty), but there's not really an issue service wise. In fact, the service was pretty good, as the food came really fast. I wouldn't really recommend this place aside from the fact that the combos are a little cheaper compared to other places, but it also doesn't taste as good. If you are looking for good combo/bento boxes I would definitely recommend \"The Midori Japanese Fushion Sushi\" instead.",

We went here for lunch and the place was not busy. We were seated right away and our server got our order. My friend got the deluxe combination which wad a few pieces of sashimi, 4 piece California rolls, tempura, rice, salad and miso soup. I got the combination of chicken katsu with rice, miso soup, 4 piece California rolls and salad. We also ordered fried oysters and baked mussels on the side. The service was good. They had a lot of staff there that kept checking on you. The food was good for me. But he didn't like it that much. Their sushi was not that good. Maybe we should have tried one of their special sushis. The price was reasonable. Just not sure if it's something that we will go back for.",

    "text": "Super disappointed in the service and treatment from Sushi Mon. I've been going to Sushi Mon for over 10 years. My family as well for many years. We came in, a party of 6 as we had family in town from Japan that specifically asked to eat at Sushi Mon after hearing about it from a friend in Japan. George told us they couldn't seat 6 comfortably and would have to wait 30/45 even though we were okay with squeezing in. He continued to tell us this was not possible. We then settled with a to go order my mom placed in which she tried to pay and George then walked away to tend to other customers. Then a young lady came and made 6 seats happen at the table we were originally to be seated at and we were confused since George told us he couldn't accommodate us which is why we settled for ordering take out. They left us waiting.. and waiting.. My mom asked to pay for the take out again, in which George then told us take out would take a 30 minute wait. We ordered the take out 15 minutes prior, confused we asked him if he even placed the order which he replied no. We asked why he didn't place the order and he said he thought we were \"figuring out what to do\" which is confusing since we ordered 3 Sushi deluxe to go because it was clear we were not going to be accommodated. So frustrated as that would make 45/50 ish minutes of standing around in this place when if George had took the order it would've been ready in 15 more minutes. It felt deliberate and like he wanted to confuse our party who then went outside in the cold looking for another place to eat. I spoke to the manager that didn't care to make this better, letting me know George has been working at sushi mon for 13 years. For what reason I don't know or care, it is irrelevant to his service and actually sad if he has been working at this establishment for so long leaving us all in disarray. She offered us a few deserts, lame offer being honest. We left, disappointed and quite frankly not sure if we will come back here as the quality and service isn't the same. This is something you don't want Japanese people to say about a sushi restaurant.",

Not to mention all their special rolls as well for the AYCE menu. If you can eat a lot of sushi like I can, you can easily get your money's worth!  Location: Corner of a shopping complex with a lot of parking. Place is kinda small, but if you don't go during peak, you'll be fine. They have bar seating as well. Best part, they're open LATE! Vegas standards, 1AM isn't late, but for sushi/restaurant standards, it meets it amazingly.  Service: No issues with service. They were attentive, kind, and very quick to refill water and clean the table off.  This most recent trip, I just wasn't hungry enough to get my money's worth and ordered the S.S. combo. First time actually that I dined here without ordering the AYCE! Combo came with their salad, soup, and the main dish which included spicy tuna roll, 3 piece nigiri, and 7 piece sashimi for $16!  Overall: I'd say this is a great sushi spot outside of LA, where I live. For some reason, I always come to Vegas and crave sushi. If you're wanting AYCE, I would suggest this spot for sure. Def bang for your buck without the loss of quality.",

Sushi Mon has both great value and product, the salmon and tuna tasted very fresh and the servers were quick and attentive. We sat at the bar and were attended to within the first minute (despite being mostly full) and were eating 5 minutes in. Normally I have to wait 30 minutes for a table, then another 10 minutes for an appetizer.  The selection of rolls and appetizers were varied enough, not the most eclectic I've seen but we loved almost everything we ordered, especially the Cynthia roll. Their baked mussels were pretty good as well. Didn't try the nigiri or sashimi so I can't review them but I will definitely be coming back for more.",

    "text": "I used to be a regular at Sushi Mon.  It was always one of our favorite all you can eat spots in town.  For some reason we hadn't been in 3 years and decided to dine there tonight.  I went with a friend and my 3 year old son.  My son does not like anything that is typically offered on a sushi menu so I packed a juice box and a plastic bag with something he would eat.  Our server mentioned that it was their policy not to allow outside food and told us that if my son were to eat or drink what I brought we would be asked to leave.  I tried to order a drink for my son (juice or milk) and was told they only carried soft drinks or lemonade.  I didn't want to cause a scene so between sushi rolls I took my 3 year old outside to eat his meal.  It was tough to explain to my son why he had to eat outside in the 105 degree heat.  The most frustrating part of this evening is when we explained to another employee why we were feeding him outside she said that she had never heard of such a policy.    I was also disappointed in the service we received.  We tried to flag the waiter down for drink refills multiple times with no luck.  Luckily the hostess had a pitcher of water and could at least keep our waters topped off.  There appeared to be plenty of servers and ours did not look overworked but we were not given much attention  The sushi wasn't bad but not like I remember it.  I know this review won't apply to people without kids but Sushi Mon made it very clear that they have enough of a customer base to be family friendly.",

Not too much globby cheese and sauce. The poke is also very fresh and not overloaded with onions like some other places do. The Cajun albacore here is still my favorite. The perfect amount of spice. Nigiri cuts are always pretty thick. The ecstacy roll and the lemon roll are my favorites. They do half rolls here, too. Which is awesome.   I love that you can also get more than one mango mochi for the all you can eat. A lot of places don't do that and I'm obsessed with mango mochi.",

I've been here before and the service was good..  I'll give them the benefit of doubt... it was after 9pm. maybe they were tired. a simple smile and welcome would have make this a better experience.",

    "text": "Great AYCE sushi. Tasty, large selection of nigiri and rolls, and friendly staff. This store's sister is Sushi Goyemon up in Spring Valley. Goyemon is also one of the highest rated sushi spots in town, and there is no percievable difference in the food, as they have the same menu and prices. Of course the actual chef could be having an off night or something that would make the quality suffer, but I've eaten at both locations multiple times and have never had that issue!  Some of my favorites are the super white tuna (seriously, I could just eat 10 servings of this and call it a day), the sexy girl roll, and of course the $6 giant Sapporo beers.  Inside is actually very small. I'd say something around 20 seats at the bar and about 10 tables. However, the longest I've had to wait is about 30 minutes and they will give you a call when a table or bar is ready.  If you live nearby, get the AYCE club card or whatever they call it. Takes 10 meals to get a free one, but after going a few times with my girl we are almost already there as they count all diners as individual meals, not 1 for the group which is nice!",

The sushi was prepared pretty quickly and the waiters were alright, although He forgot to refill my drink the whole time and we had to wait for the check for awhile... it wasn't even that busy also.   All these 5 stars are baffling to me, this place isn't even close to that.

Then I asked if we could sit outside because they have a patio with tables and I got told that the only way to sit outside was to order togo... Why have a patio and not use it for service. I normally go to sushi for the all you can eat so ordering togo makes no sense to me. So I decided to leave and I won't be coming back.

Starving and relieved that finally we're going in, two people drove right up, no  waitimg list needed for them and this hostess (short girl with blond dyed, black roots) automatically offers them one of those tables and tries to squeeze us in the other?? That's where I lost my mind!  Especially because there was a 2 seater opened for them and we needed both tables. This hostess refused to put both tables together for us and rudely told us we'd have to wait 15 minutes longer till more tables open up (4 separate parties had to leave first =8 seats still. ) WTH? When we were done, one of those two tables were still unused. So Dumb! If it wasn't for your waitress' making a way for us, you would've lost our Tip let alone our business lastnight!

Be forewarned:  This places is POPULAR and SMALL so it can get crowded and service can get bogged down during busy times.  I really like how AYCE allows you to order half-rolls.  I know several places do that but this was my first experience with one...hee.  What to order: Dragon Roll (I'm biased), Aloha Roll, Moon Roll, umm... just look at the menu and dive in.

Between the 4 out of 5 star rating, and remembering that I had heard good th8ings about Sushi Mon, we decided to meet there for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon.   Most of the tables were full when we arrived so we decided to sit at the bar. After a quick glance at the menu it was clear that AYCE would be the best way for us to go so we started out with some edamame, miso soup for my friend and drinks while we decided on a few rolls.   I love that they offer 1/2 rolls, it allows me to try things that look yummy but I am not sure about. I also love that ACYE included nigiri sushi, and the fish was nice and thick and tasted very fresh. We started with an order of tuna, salmon and yellowtail to start and ended up having seconds and then thirds of the tuna as it was just delicious.   As for rolls, we started with 1/2 orders of Caterpillar and Philadelphia rolls. These are my basics that I almost always order, and Sushi Mon did them well. We also had the Frying Jason roll which was a baked  roll that had scallops and yum yum sauce. A little heavy on the sauce but I would certainly order it again. We finished off with a Spider Roll because my friend wanted somethign with soft shell crab. This was made with soy paper and was large so I had a hard time eating it. This was my least favorite of the rolls we had...  The only problem I had was having to ask for water refill. Otherwise it was an extremely tasty lunch. They charge a little more for AYCE then some places but the quality of fish makes it worth it in my book... Sushi Mon is definitely on my go back ASAP list.",

Of all the joint's we've ate at we've obviously never heard of it and I must say it was pretty good.",

When the cashier called the restaurant manager to explain our concerns, she replied that she doesn't have control over the quality of the fish and food....WHAT?  That was by far the stupidest thing I ever heard.  The service sucked, all but one person was nice...the rest could care less about their job.  Maybe this was just a one off, but I'd rather spend my money on other All You Can Eat Sushi places around Vegas.",

Our server was nice for the most part and came around to check on us often. We kept ordering back to back and the chefs kept up to the point we ordered more than what we could handle (always happens! LOL).. It is all you can eat sushi n they have dessert too. Everything tasted fresh and the portion of rice tk the fish was PERFECT! It was enough where you could taste the fish, not spam musubi style where 90% is rice. They do give a stamp card so if youre. regular, dont forget to ask!",

Yesterday we did too, but I was noticing that this place would be very affordable if you wanted to get something other than AYCE. Most of their regular sushi things (think california roll) are only about $6 for a full order, and soft drinks are only $1.50- which I have never seen at a restaurant before. Anyway, the AYCE was great yet again. We always leave full and happy. Our orders came quickly and the waiters and bussers are quick to clean off any empty plates. We really enjoyed our early dinner here. Took 1 star off simply because it was REALLY HOT in there yesterday. Not sure if there was no AC, maybe the AC was out. It was just really hot which was not great for an AYCE setting. I highly recommend the Moon, Frying Jason, Pastel, and Golden Knights!",

I'm not going to say it's the best sushi I've ever had but I will say that it's the best ayce sushi in Vegas.     I've been to quite a few other places and none other than goyemon (which is a sister restaurant of sushi mon) can compare.   While sometimes you get a miss and the service is bad or the sushi isn't that great but most of the time you'll get A service and good quality sushi.   Especially if you're like me and don't want it drowning in some sweet disgusting sauce.    Definitely give this place at least 3 tries and judge for yourself!",

I started a birthday tradition that only lasted 2 years after last night ....and keep In mind I never said it was my birthday because I wasn't expecting any special treatment .  Stay away from the short Hispanic girl with long black hair ( in a ponytail ) she is so rude !   I first called to ask if I can make a reservation..... her response was \" we don't do reservations over the phone \" so i asked how I can make a reservation, her response was \" come In and if there is a wait then out your name down and we can call you \" THAT IS NOT A RESERVATION ...facepalm ......  Then we get there and it was not busy at all , there was a total of 4 of us , but only myself and my partner had arrived . Naturally we ask to be seated because i was super hungry , the same girl who answered the phone told us she couldn't seat us until the entire party was there ...... I can understand if there was people waiting to sit down and they were slammed .....they had at lease 4 open tables ! We had to sit in the hot parking lot waiting for the rest of our party .  Our server was decent , but left halfway through our dinner and didn't even tell us . No one checked on us the entire dinner . Our bus boy basically became our server .....  Before getting the check my friend had a free meal to redeem and they wouldn't honor it because it was expired last month ....any small business should honor a free meal especially when it goes to show that someone has been there at least 10 times.... but did they no !   Lastly ....we asked the so pleasant girl/ host from earlier if we could get our check ......and that it would need to be split by couples ( and we did hand motions to show how to split the check ) well we get the check and she just split it down the middle ! This was a problem because my other half only had one roll and we had some drinks ....so it wasn't a even split .......I kindly ( even though I was completely over this place at this point) brought it to the host attention ......she replied with \" well you said to split it \" ...THAT IS NOT WHAT WE SAID  and not only that don't argue with your customers! It then took about 20 minutes to sort out the check fiasco .....I will find a new all you can eat sushi place from now on",

Our server was knowledgeable and encouraged us to try some different things on the menu and if we didn't care for them to let him know. That was really nice considering there's a sign that you can't waste anything, even the rice. But anyways, the only reason why I'm giving a 4 instead of a 5 was that service was a bit slow. We ordered a few plates and it didn't come till after our desserts were delivered even when we ordered those particular plates a few orders prior to dessert but other than that, the fish was fresh and everything was very tasty. I went overboard with the specialty rolls but being too full and skipping dinner that night was worth it.  I'd definitely be back again!",

    "text": "This place can get pretty crazy crowded in here.  I was definitely a skeptic, but thought it was more than decent after our AYCE meal.    The fish to rice ratio for the nigiri were perfect, especially for all you can eat.  Small cut of fish and the proper amount of rice to make this one-bite, as it was meant for, that much more satisfying.  That is my one pet peeve about AYCEs, is they make massive portions and 2 rolls max, you'll be stuffed with just on rice.  Not here...  The fact that they offer salmon belly was a big score for my guests this evening.  $26.95 for dinner, just ordering a few uni nigiri and salmon belly already paid for itself.  We all opted for AYCE, so sharing was really convenient and allowed us to try more things on the menu.  highlights for me-   tako poke- though a little chewy with light flavoring, more of a ponzu taste was a refreshing change. salmon belly- marbled like crazy throughout, but that made it that much more buttery hamachi kama- fully cooked yellowtail collar bone with a side of ponzu and chopped scallion.  I always find this dish so satisfying to pick at. uni- nice delicate pieces gently laid over a bite size amount of rice. The seaweed wrapped the whole rice with the leftover stuck left out to the shape of number '6'.  Rich and buttery, YUM! red bean ice cream and green tea ice cream- scoops of heaven, hints of matcha and hints of red beans.  Not the best quality, but definitely not too shabby.   The albacore, sashimi salad, red snapper were all good too.  The extensive menu included specials for the night, lots of side dishes and the nigiri was the most impressive for me.    We ordered but one roll to share amongst the four of us and the sexy girl is a no go.  Stuffed with the California roll as the base, a little piece of the tempura shrimp and bits of scallops on top over too much whatever sauce and whole load of tempura sprinkles.    My one other complaint was the temperature was set way too high for the amount of people in the restaurant. We were situated in a corner with the larger table, under the vent and the heat was so uncomfortable, that the blast of cold air from the ocassional opened door was more than welcomed.    Towards the end of our meal, the service got super slow and ordering became more of a waiting game, so we settled for our dessert a little sooner.    Sushi snob, I am not, but this was a decent sushi joint.  I haven't enjoyed much sushi out here, for the fact of being disappointed in comparison to Hawaii and Cali sushi.    I'm super excited that we have this place in Henderson.",

Service was helpful and friendly.  The menu was easy to read and came with pictures which was a plus.    I still prefer my usual sushi spot but SushiMon had the Ecstasy Roll which was so good that I will come back just for that.

Sitting at the bar is hectic cuz the sushi chefs are really busy.   It's my go to place for sushi fix and it's only 5 minutes away from my house.  Wait could be like 30 minutes to an hour but they have an app that will text you when it's almost your time.   So I go there and put my name down... go home and wait for the text.  Lol.  I love the menu selections and the specials.   My son always gets the bento box.",

I love Sushi Mon because of the fresh taste that their fish has. I eat everything from eel to octopus to tuna to just their appetizers. Everything is so delicious and fresh that it will leave you wanting more. Get ACE if you want to try everything. It's all yummy.

Me and my friend sat at the bar but then  5min later other people came in and where way too close to us where we could hardly move, at all! My elbows were literally hitting the person next to me! We politely asked the manager \"Archer\" if we could be seated else where because we felt too uncomfortable sitting by the bar. \"Archer\"  with a stupid look on his face and fucked up attitude said no because we had already sat down... when there was so many empty tables free... this made my eating experience at SUSHI-MON a headache and felt disrespected in public...

I couldn't wait to get it home since I was starving.  We ate the sushi first and that was good like always. Next came the chicken teriyaki... everything was fine until I got to the last piece of chicken. It had a bone in it and I bit down hard on it and I felt the pain in my tooth. I immediately spit it out and ran to the bathroom mirror. I didn't see any damage but I can still feel a slight pain.   I just hope they are more careful in the future. I will continue to get take out from there but I think I'll just stick with the sushi rolls.  I would have given them four stars but I deducted one star for the chicken bone.",

I replied that no we sat ourselves because there was no one at the front. She then rudely replied \"Nope you guys need to get up there is a waiting list\" even though there were several tables open that when I pointed this out to her she said it's because she gives people on the waiting list 10 Minutes to come back for their seating. She didn't even offer to put us on a waiting list and didn't seem to care we were going to take our business elsewhere. Her attitude alone was enough to give this restaurant a 1 star, Because I believe customer service is the most important asset to a business it.

Sushi Mon is a small and lightly decorated place with some good eats to offer.  The fish is fresh and the portion sizes are decent.  On a shady note, they do seem to pack a whole lot of rice in every bite.  Tactic to fill you up on rice faster?  Probably.  You can pack away a variety of items before having to loosen the belt.  They have daily/nightly specials written out so make sure you take a peek at the board before you order.  As far as AYCE goes, they're not bad.  I do think there are better sushi places you could go to but if you want speedy seating and no-fuss service, come here!  You get what you pay for without the unnecessary frills.    Whenever my friends and I come here, we try to score a seat at the sushi bar.  It's always fun watching the sushi chefs prepare stuff and if it's slow, they make random handrolls and other items for you to try.  The chefs are sweeties but the waitresses tend to steer clear when you're sitting at the bar.  Can a girl get more tea please?",

Some buffet style sushi can taste cheap but not Sushi Mon. We had a magical experience and left hoot with our bill. Pro-Tip #1: Don't drink carbonated beverages.

We sat at the large table just inside the door, it seats six, and that was the size of our party. We spent almost an hour in the restaurant, all ordering AYCE, and were only able to order twice. Once upon arrival, and once for dessert. What a sham. We kept trying to flag down the waiter (this place is tiny, so there shouldn't have been an issue) and he was just too busy for us, apparently. We requested a hot tea refill 3 separate times to no avail. The nigiri that I was able to get to the table was great, fresh scallop had a pine flavor to it - strange. Our friends had many rolls - they ordered everything they wanted in the first order, and asked later on why we ordered so little. We explained that with AYCE, you're supposed to order little by little so you don't over-order. They have clearly eaten here so often that they knew you only really had one solid chance of getting your order in. Sad.   We won't be back to this locaton. We'll stick with the other Sushi-Mon and Goye-mon along with other faves in the valley.",

I can't say that it's the best sushi I've had in town - but it seems pretty darn good for a strip mall in Henderson.

They make their rice really small and the piece of fish large, so you're not overwhelmed with the sushi rice.

The host sat us quickly and tried to merge 2 tables together but to try to make it easier for them we said they can leave it separated. We sat down and they came back and said the server wants the table together which was fine we didn't really care. They only gave us 3 menus (mind you there were 6 adults and 4 kids. So we asked for more menus no big deal but come on. I mentioned to the server JEFFREY that we plan to split our bill and he said ok but you can tell he was irritated. JEFFREY took 1 person order on one side of the table cause we weren't ready so the other side of the table decided to order. When he was done taking their order I asked if we can order so he wouldn't have to go back and forth and when walking back to the other side of the table he rolls his eyes and mouths \"oh my fucking God\".  And that's where I lost it. I'm pretty sure it's your job JEFFREY to take our order so why give us attitude for something that's your job!!! I hope the manager sees this post  because it's UNACCEPTABLE!!! Please talk to your employee to ensure this does not happen again.  And JEFFREY learn proper customer service especially if you plan to stay in the food industry.",

And after we got home from eating, about 4 hours later, my husband got extremely sick he threw up everywhere. I then followed suit. :( it's still really early in the morning so I'm sick this morning but first thing I'm going to do is call the restaurant.",

The lychee had real lychee pieces and was really refreshing. The green tea ice cream was more like matcha green tea, very great. The mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream were not worth it. Food wise, the fish was pretty decent and fresh, the portions are small so you can try it all. Overall a really great deal!",

I called several times for a table for 10 and they stuck to their policy and wouldn't put our name on the list. It worked out fine and we only had to wait 20 minutes. They are strict to their no sharing policy but are fine with letting some people order a la carte and others ordering all you can eat. It works out perfect if you have light or finicky eaters. I would definitely come back here! Delicious for sure!!!",

If you ever go to Vegas and crave sushi, this is the place you need to be. You can't imagine how fresh the sushi is in the desert. Referred by my friend Kenny C, he was right on about this place. Sushi Mon is what it's hyped up to be.   The 27 dollar all you can eat sushi simply put..............is phenomenal. There are some rules and limitations on your sushi intake. You have to eat all of the rice, there is a time limit of 45 minutes, and you will get penalize if you waste food. Fair enough!!!   Each person is allowed to order one order of uni(comes in a pair nigiri style), one order of amaebi(comes in a pair, nigiri, and one order of the hamachi kama(half a cheek). These 3 orders by itself is well worth the 27 dollars. All three orders were excellent. You figure it would be lower quality uni, shrimp, and filled with a big glob of rice right??? No, it wasn't. There was very little rice and the uni and shrimp were extremely fresh. The hamachi kama was cooked perfectly, had that nice char from the grill that gives it that smoky flavor and it was seasoned well.   The rest of the sushi were good as well. The halibut, tuna, salmon.........were all fantastic. I tried to get away with some of the rolls because I didn't want to get filled up from the rice. Believe it or not, they were also fantastic. I have absolutely no complaints about this place and will be sure to come back the next time I am in Vegas.   Bookmark this place!!! This is definitely a must try.",

I normally don't like going to all you can eat sushi places because I feel like most are trying to cheat you by giving you rolls or sashimi packed with rice or a lot of sweet eel sauce or all the rolls are made of california rolls with different toppings. However, this place is not like that. Their rolls size are perfect, and they have variety of different rolls and sashimi and not all california rolls based. You can also order half orders so you can save your stomach for more tastings. The sushi chefs are japanese so it is def authentic.

There's also an assortment of rolls to choose from such as the spider roll and salmon skin roll. Beware... the rolls are huge!   Some of the items are one-order-per such as the Sweet Shrimp and the Sea Urchin. But they also have a bunch of other none sushi stuff that's all you can eat such as the miso soup, green tea ice cream and shu mai.   The place is small but can still accommodate a couple of large groups. A real cozy feel with waiters watching you to make sure you don't waste food.   They were quick to respond and take additional orders.  Overall you get what you paid for and for $27.00 (dinner) I can see myself coming back for more.  Just don't expect the best quality.",

The best things on the menu besides the rolls are the baked mussels and Ahi Poki.  Just those two I could eat forever.  I would have given this place 5 stars if I didn't have to wait so long for dinner.  But it was well worth the wait.  Sushi Mon needs to expand so they have more tables.",

    "text": "my boyfriend's sister, who's a sin city local raves about this place! so on our last visit we made this our final stop just before heading to the airport. i have to admit we were a bit skeptical at first. we're pretty hardcore sushi eaters and this place just seemed way too good to be True!  the four of us came for the sushi buffet at about $25 per person. we seriously tried just about every roll on the menu and were stuffed but still made room for dessert! who could turn down endless green tea ice cream scoops right? the fish was fresh and the rolls each had it's own sushi mon little twist to it. i forget the names, but i enjoyed their variation of the usual spider roll and garlic tuna.   this place is a super steal at price, quantity and quality! generally a couple rolls sets the check at about $30 at typical sushi bars. needless to say we boarded our returning flight satisfied and full. sushi mon will definitely be one of our number one hit up spots when visiting vegas from now on.",

The best items to order are fresh scallop and tuna belly sushi.  It sure beat the regular sushi restaurant in terms of food qaulity.  Price wise - only $27.99 for dinner, that's a very reasonable price for a buffet in Vegas.  I will definitely come back!",

    "text": "Oh, dearest me, Sushi mon, Sushi mon, sigh, why oh why do you charge so much for all you can eat sushi? Is the fish quality better than any other AYCE sushi restaurants? Absolutely not. Are their rolls superior to other AYCE sushi restaurants? Nope!  This wildly popular sushi joint is gleaming with southern Las Vegas patrons. They are swarmed with clients day in and day out and late night. I walked in at 11pm on a Friday and there was a large crowd of people waiting to either get into the restaurant or just hanging out in front of Sushi Mon. I guess that is the new thing these days. \"Hey, we are going to hang out at Sushi Mon and pretend we are cool.\" Nevertheless, the wait was short as I was dining alone and the bar was sufficient for myself.   I started to look at their laminated menu and took a look around the restaurant itself. The restaurant itself is bland, Someone had the bright idea of putting tile, in a diagonal pattern, on the wall. Are you kidding me? EPIC FAIL. The seating is quite spread out and the restaurant itself is quite small. The sushi chefs are abundant, however, and that is usually a great sign for a busy restaurant. The patrons seemed happy indulging in their gluttony of raw fish, rice, mayo and cream cheese creations. I for one, always order the sushi first before I order any specialty rolls.   The salmon sushi was just meh to my standards. Their salmon was a bit  warm and the texture seemed off. The tuna was good and their yellowtail was surprising very good. I do have to say their rolls are quite interesting. I can't really remember what I ordered, but what I did order tasted a-ok to me. I remember asking my sushi chef to make me their best roll they had. It was some shrimp tempura roll concoction wrapped in soy paper. Can't remember the name but I remember liking it very much.   As for the positive sides of the restaurant, I can see why people like this place. The warm welcoming staff, the sushi chefs, and the massive amount of people waiting to attack their sushi rolls with their salivating palates.   A word for the owners. You are doing a great job. I hope you continue to succeed. For Christ's sake, please take that stupid tile down from the wall and put up some authentic artwork or something! Augh, it really makes me not want to dine there because of the crappy decor. Stop charging so much for standard sushi quality! Then again, if people are paying it why stop right? I understand.    Yes I would return to the restaurant, but, I probably wouldn't go by myself again. If my friends are willing to go I may just join them.",

    "text": "Having been jaded by \"All You Can Eat Sushi\" before my husband and I were hesitant to meet our local family members at a strip mall for sushi.  We had even made alternate dinner plans with our friends on the Strip, just in case.  It was a week night and pretty early 5:30 pm so there was a lot of room for our party of 5.  The waitstaff seemed a little standoffish at first, but after we ordered they were very quick to refill our hot tea and check on us.  3 of our family members ordered entrees.  The portions were huge and looked tasty.  My husband and I ordered the AYCE and were very surprised to see that there were so many choices for both rolls and negri.  We ordered several rolls both standard (spider, spicy tuna, yellow tail) and specialty (Vegas a go go)  We were delighted to taste fresh fish.  We ordered till our mercury levels were off the charts and then the sea called and asked us to pace ourselves for fear they could not generate enough fish for the rest of the world.  We left satisfied and happy.  I do appreciate their 20% charge if you do not finish the sushi you order.  I also appreciate the 1 hour limit on AYCE except if I was going to be held by it...I am not sure if its really busy that AYCE is worth it if you only have an hour.",

    "text": "I love this tiny place! Far away from the strip, but located in a strip mall, this is a veritable treasure in the city of sin.   Any time of day, for $25.95 per person, you can eat all you want - anything you want - on the menu.  Though there is a sixty minute time limit, I have never been kicked out after an hour.  However, after eating sushi for an hour you are done! Especially after eating their deep fried or monster rolls, you won't have much room left. I advise sitting at the sushi bar.  You can tell the sushi chef directly what you want, you can have half orders of almost all the rolls, so you can sample a wide variety. Here is a sample of what I ordered on my recent visit, just to give you an idea: Dynamite (scallops baked with mushrooms and onion, a creamy mayo sauce, into a scallop shell) 5.25 Baked Green Mussels 5.95 Cajun Albacore Sushi (this is my favorite) 4.00 Salmon Sushi 3.50 Seared Tuna 4.00 Salmon Roe 3.75 1/2 order of Mingus Roll (deep fried spicy tuna, cream cheese, and avocado) 4.25 Pixie Roll (deep fried sot shell crab, spicy yum-yum shrimp and cucumber, avocade, wrapped with soybean paper and topped with smelt eggs) 10.75 J.J. Roll (crab stick tempura, cream cheese, avocado, asparagus, topped with eel sauce)  Of course I sampled my friend's dishes as well, and they were all delicious.  Though only the sushi is all you can eat, there is still an extensive Japanase cuisine menu, from which to sample. Drinks are not included in the all you can eat, but the desert is also included. I love the green tea ice cream and the plum sorbet. Curious about the 50 rolls they have? Go to the website for their complete menu and photos and descriptions of all the rolls.",

Don't forget the strawberrry mochi, and ice cream tempura, baked mussels and ahi poke are great too. This is the real deal, for sushi in vegas, forget the strip, with the over priced rolls.

    "text": "This is my sushi place.  If I'm not scoping out a new place, this is my old-reliable sushi place.  Sushi Mon is a small privately owned sushi restaurant in a rather nondescript shopping center on the corner of Maryland and Silverado.  It's also very popular, so be prepared to wait for up to half an hour or even 45 minutes on busy nights.  That being said, it's totally worth even an hour wait to get in.  The sushi chefs are fun and talkative, and really help you out, and will make you custom rolls if you ask for it.  The fish is always fresh and flavorful, and they have a lot of specialty rolls, and are always adding more.  In addition, they have a large selection of nigiri, and will always have a special of the day posted on the wall.  The wait stuff is quick and efficient, though they don't have as much personality as the chefs.  And the manager is the best guy ever.    Personal favorites are the jala-jala roll, the sushi-bon, Pete's roll, and the must-have Dynamite.    The all-you-can-eat is $26.95, which is a little daunting for newbies, but it's the only choice for a Sushi Mon-ster like me.  Keep in mind, too, that you can get half-rolls as well, so you're not stuck eating a huge roll that you wanted to try but didn't like.  This is a social experience, so don't go alone, it's just not fun, is it?    Also, they have an all-you-can-eat punch card.  Eat 10 times, and you get your 11th one free.  I've made use of this 3 times in the last year.  Here's a secret:  Take friends from out of town!  You can have their stamps and add to your card! :D    Finally, this place is just plain consistent.  I've been to other sushi places where they were good one day, and not good the next.  The service would be worse, or the fish would be less fresh, or some thing.  Sushi Mon has always been good and delicious and has never let me down yet, and I've been here more often than those other places combined.    Don't look for fine dining, just fun, over-stuffed sushi dining!",

Everything was great quality and the selection was very extensive from side dishes, to specialty rolls and even desserts. The Tiger roll was great along with the fresh nigri rolls and the sake shooters were YUMMy too. All in all this was a great find and I would go back many a times if I had the opportunity. Forget eating on the over priced strip, this is where its at.",

The manager at the front desk has the worst service as it was a cold night out we had kids with us and he rejected us a seat stating we could go somewhere else if we cant wait.  It took us 60 dollars in taxi fee to get there to try it out and he told us we could go somewhere else if we dont want to wait for him to feel the mood to let us in.  The night was busy but he was letting in 2 to 3 people but not reserving table for us.  STAY AWAY!",

So for the most part you will be waiting at least 30 mins if you go in the evening. Thank goodness they opended up a sister property Goyemon which gives you the same great taste with great ambience plus its on our side of town. Cant go wrong there! either way its worth checking out :)",

    "text": "Went to this place coz I could not get a table at my fav sushi place on a Fri night. I love sushi and having had sushi all around vegas, I consider this to be the worst in vegas.  I firmly believe, I eat with my eyes first. So, if it looks appetizing, It makes me feel good.  - For starters, it was stuffed with rice. - Size of few rolls were too big. It kept bouncing off of my mouth. - Very unprofessional staff. Smile dammit!!! when food is ordered. Staff should be friendly even when they don't want to. U are a running a restaurant. So hire such people and make the guest feel invited. - It gets worse now, I was sitting at the bar and some dude kept washing/cleaning the floor every 3 mins. I felt sick seeing a guy mop the floor while I was having food. This went on for the entire duration I was there. -  Very disorganized. No system to track who ordered what. I was sitting at the bar, the chef could not remember my order multiple times. I was given 3-4 rolls that wasn't mine. - Got a chance to peek at the back. The floor was covered with some white power that looked like flour.(Flour in a Sushi Bar?????) May be they think about cleaning the kitchen floor once in a while rather than cleaning the bar every 3 mins. - Slightly overpriced, but I don't mind shelling out few extra bucks since I love sushi so much. But this place just Blows!!!  Bottom Line: I'll be back to this place only in their dreams and in my nightmares. I would rate it 0/5 but yelp wudnt let me :(  My recommendation:  Yama Sushi(Maryland Pkwy & Flamingo). This place is the best in Vegas. 100 bucks, you will keep coming back to this place for more. If you digg sashimi, definitely try \"Seafood Salad\". Its out of this world. Yummy :)))",

Came in around 12pm and ordered lots of half-order baked rolls and fancy sushi. The raw fish, esp. the yellowtail, was very fresh. The strawberry mochi was also very impressive as a dessert.  Based on my previous experience, I gave it a second try last week during lunch time. However I found that there must be something different... I can tell the sushi was made differently, although all the chefs were the same. When I pick up the sushi, the rice fell apart easily. I was not sure if it's because the chef did not make the roll correctly, or the rice was not made for sushi at all. But with the price they charge, it is not supposed to happen (especially it's made by Japanese chefs!). The chef lapsed our order several times even when we were sitting at the sushi bar. Even if the raw fish was still fresh, I was feeling so different that I have to gave it only 3-start this time.  C'mon sushi mon, you fish deserves 5-star, what happened to your sushi rice??",

Yes, I know it's in the middle of a desert, but I expect some freshness when I'm eating raw. The yellow tail roll looked like clumps of fish paste. the sweet shrimp tasted like it had been sitting out on the docks for days before transport to Vegas. It was a hard dinner to digest. As far as the \"all-you-can-eat\" deal, I asked for 3 orders of sweet shrimp but was limited to only 2.  I consider this a False advertisement as it's not  \"all-you-can-eat\", but rather \"what we are willing to serve you\".  I used to live here and there are other far better local  joints that serve decent fresh fish. Anyone who rated this place more than 1 star must be on crack or smokin' something  really good. Either way, I'd rather be doing that than gambling on my food.",

    "text": "There is a Vietnamese boy at this sushi joint! At first I had the suspicious that he's Vietnamese but kept on thinking he might be Korean or Japanese. He looks kinda like Kim Hyun Joong but Kim Hyun Joong has plastic surgeon and 99-100% of Korean actors have plastic surgeon. He doesn't have plastic surgeon so I kept on thinking he must be Vietnamese. I finally asked if he is and he said yes but he doesn't know how to speak Vietnamese. Mystery solved. He doesn't seem as difficult or strict as the Korean and Japanese. Might be easy going to ask him then the others. Usually I don't dare to ask to much except to eat my food and pay. He's young so will have less experience but I'm Vietnamese I can handle inexperience than strict personality. He looks like he's from Da Lat region. Em trai nhin thay yeu uoi, nen uong sua pha voi  bot calcium cho to con len!   As for the food, I live a block away so I have to come here for sushi. Everything is either prudent or bland here. Salad has a prudent ginger soy sauce with sesame oil. Sushi hand cut and all sushi roll have bland taste. Fish taste ok, but from time to time the tuna is brown. I stay away from it multiple times. Dipping sauce is only soy sauce + wasabi and no other sauce available. High fresh quality might be given to Kabotu. I have the suspicious that SushiMon is part of Kabotu, Goyemon, and Monta Ramen. Monta Ramen is the noodle house and Goyemon is the sister sushi house that will capture those that doesn't like or know SushiMon. SushiMon on the westside is for those that are in the west but are a fan of SushiMon. Kabotu is for those that willing to pay for the higher quality fish reserve for its priority. Goyemon might be the sister but both SushiMon locations will always have a better quality of fish. Goyemon might is the 3rd standard, so 1st Kabotu, 2nd SushiMon, and 3rd Goyemon.   Best dishes for the buck are the Salmon Dinner Special and Sashimi Lunch Special (include rice + miso soup + salad). 3 hand cuts or 2 hand rolls lunch special (include miso soup + salad) for $9 is not bad. Good price. Sushi at Wasabi on Eastern might be a little better but SushiMon's price is the best in this area. Nake Sushi in Summerlin on Rampart x Lake Mead has a similar deal, but it's in the west side. Here in the southeast, SushiMon is the place.  This is an AYCE, so be smart when you order or else wait. Order 4-6 at first then go down. DO NOT order 2 at a time, because that's a long wait. Those that complained about the wait, is because they do not go to AYCE often or have lack of experience with AYCE. It's like the Rio buffet, when it's self serve it's fast that's because you serve yourself, but once you order something special like a sauce the waiter seems to disappear for a very long time.",

We waited and was seated in less than 20.  We got a nice seating in the bar area.  After being seated, I was ready to eat.  I was amused by the ayce rules.  60 mins. I was curious what would happen if I went over by 5 mins?  I absolutely loved how great the ayce menu was.  Side dishes and dessert?? dang!  I am sold.  Nice because I felt like i had my own sushi chef.  We told him different items to prepare for us.  Very nicely presented and the fish felt fresh.  I like that because I have had poor experience at other places.  For an ayce, I see why there's a line outside.  I enjoyed the 624, baked sushi which I haven't had before.  Very unique and hot!  The snow crab was a little dry.  I didn't like it.  Friend was craving for salmon and we over ordered.  Regardless, it was very delightful.  I usually have a hard time with rare fish, but it wasn't an issue tonight.  House was very efficient  on getting our side dishes.  We had very awkward request.  We had ice cream in the middle of our meal.  Sushi chef thought we were done.  I tried some lychee sorbet, very tasty but not for me.  I did enjoy the special mochi mango ice cream.  Friend was full, but I told her it was amazing.  She managed to intake half of it.    Service was nice, Sushi Chef was friendly and chatty.  Overrall, a great atmosphere.

    "text": "I absolutely love this place! It would be my first go-to choice for sushi. They have a fairly big menu and the prices are pretty decent. I love variety so I always choose to have ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi.  You have to finish your order before you order the next roll.  That makes sense because it'd be such a waste of food, and of course no sharing.  Don't be cheap and ghetto and try to dish it off to your friends.  The prices are already fair as is.  Service is fast and friendly.  I love their 911 roll! I have a pretty high tolerance for spices and this roll is so painfully delicious.  When it comes to a spicy tuna roll, I prefer the tuna well diced and mixed with chili sauce which is how Sushi Mon makes theirs.  I don't like the low end sushi style of a tuna roll with just a blob of spicy mayo on top.  Their LASAGNA ROLL is also a favorite.  Try it out.  The last time I was there, I had apple/pear sake.  It was so good.  That says a lot from someone who rarely likes sake because of it's strong taste and burning sensation.  You definitely should give it a shot.  Off topic - it's a small restaurant. You get the mom and pop shop vibe (which I love and appreciate) Seating is pretty limited.  They're usually busy so they don't take reservations. That's the only \"bad\" thing I'll say about the place. Just make sure you plan to wait a little bit if you decide to dine their during the naturally busy hours.  Overall, I miss and love this place!",

Reading some of the negative reviews on this place, I just have to comment.Too much rice and rolls are too big? Come on people! Its sushi, not sashimi. In Japan, the piece of fish you get is HALF the size they serve us in America. So of course your going to rice with your fish. If you dont like rice order the more expensive plate of sashimi instead.   With that said, they have an extensive amount of rolls to choose from. The price might be a little high ($27 for dinner) but they also have stamp cards for All You Can Eat. Buy 10 and get the 11th free!   So with good quality sushi comes price, but its well worth it.

We went on a late Friday night, and here are the problems:  - already slightly pricey, and all the limited quantity items (uni, clams, etc.) were out - can't get the orders right and kept bringing us random stuff - that seafood salad thing is huge - looks impressive, taste is okay, but it's just a bunch of leftover fish chopped and drenched in soy sauce...not too impressed. - bad/not very nice service but speed was okay - can't really taste the fish...which makes eating sushi pointless. - nigiri had tons of rice  Okay, there are a few good things: - the special rolls on the menu are pretty nice, definitely try the wet dream and what some of the other yelpers have mentioned - plus points for some of the good looking waitresses  All in all, I won't be heading back to this place anytime soon. There's gotta be better sushi buffet in Vegas than this one.",

They don't have any fancy fish selections but they have the basic and they are done well. The fish was fresh, the service quick. The fish to rice ratio of the nigiri was good. The rice was done well, not too tangy, not mushy, doesn't fall apart. Loved the yellowtail, red snapper, and albacore that day. I'd say pass on the fried oysters and the green mussels. Rolls are ok.   All in all, definitely worth the $30 and the ~25mins drive off the strip (as a vegas visitor).",

A double-sided menu of food that is made-to-order greets you, yay! My exact order (almost) every time is as follows: edamame, seaweed salad, cajun albacore, pastel roll, sexy girl roll, yellowtail collar and strawberry mochi. If I'm feeling a little frisky, I'll order the mussels as well. Did I mention I get all of this for $26.95?! Amazing, I know.   Due to their amazing menu size, they do ask that you not waste any food and eat all you order (cue the forklift to get me home). When you order a roll, you have the option of ordering a half roll so that you can order more of a variety.   The only reason Sushi Mon lost a star is for the size. The tables are sooo close together and I wouldn't dream of going here with a large group in fear of having to wait 45+ minutes for a table.   Side note for parents: Your little ones can share the AYCE with you if they are young enough to sit in a high chair, which is a nice touch.",

The roll pieces were really big and thick, so that being said I was filled up fast and didn't eat half of the roll. When she came by she asked why I didn't eat it, which was weird. But I told her.

Their specials included multiple nigiris that I haven't had before at AYCE spots including mackerel. They were very timely with service, providing water whenever we were low and coming around to clean up finished dishes very quickly. Of course the total bill was enormous with the beer and sake we ordered in conjunction, but with the fun atmosphere (we caught the end of a Packers-Bears game on the TV at the bar) that allowed us to sake bomb at the table, I will definitely return and recommend to friends and family.",

    "text": "This restaurant has been a staple for sushi lovers, including myself, for a long time. I've been coming here for AYCE only so I can't speak much for the regular menu. But I can say their AYCE has always been solid and consistent which is why it seems to be always busy and which is why your service may take a hit. Be prepared to wait to be seated in the small restaurant during peak hours and to occasionally wait for your server or sushi chef during your meal because they are tied up.  They have extended hours for the late night cravings. For the novice sushi eaters, there are plenty of pictures on the menu to aid you. If you're sitting at the bar, the chefs are more than willing to answer any questions or fill any requests. Keep your eye on the chalkboard for any specials also.  This last visit I sat at the sushi bar just after opening on a Saturday and had a solid meal of appetizers and nigiri. The chef was busy but made sure my meal was flowing smoothly. I didn't get any rolls as all of the 30 pieces of nigiri were delicious and enough to satisfy me. They had two clam specials: Asari rayu and orange clam (I took pictures of both but they were pretty crappy so I didn't post them) which both had oil and sauce respectively that elevated the clam which is something I normally don't order.  Sushi Mon is not head and shoulders above the rest and they're location is not convenient for me. I am still a fan though and will continue to frequent there but it will most likely be only late night, or if I happen to be driving in the area and the wait looks reasonable.",

I stopped going because I moved to a different city, then to a different area of LV and it's sad how bad this place is now.   Positive change - they've finally added more seating for people waiting outside. Negative changes - more things missing from the menu, slow service (waiters and sushi chefs), crappier quality sushi.   My very fav smoked salmon nigiri has been off the menu for a while, but now they also got rid of the fried oysters, couple rolls I liked and the curry bowl too. Despite sitting at the sushi bar on a night that wasn't full, it took forever to get sushi (they had 5 chefs working). The dishes piled up since the waiters never stopped, and I had to literally grab them to put in orders as they ran by since waving did nothing.     Dry hamachi and salmon kama, sloppy looking rolls and nigiri, smaller pieces of fish and they don't seem to put wasabi in the nigiri anymore. Spicy scallop hand roll that literally had 2 pieces of bay scallop mixed in with a lot of imitation crab, and also wasn't spicy at all. Even my lychee ice cream was all crystallized and icy.   The quality had been going down for a while, but I'm officially done with Sushi Mon now - there are too many other ayce options to waste money here.",

He is the reason why I'm giving the extra star on my review. Super nice, always trying to convince you what's the days special and new items. Convinced me so well I got a new item from his suggestions. Very smiley and I love it. Tries to keep a conversation with you.   Currently eating their AYCE. I've been to multiple multiple AYCE. I usually vary by options and prices. Option wise they have a handful, not as much as the ones I usually go to near UNLV but this their options are decent. Prices are the same as any other one. By the way, I am eating for 1, so sitting at the bar was my best choice. Thursday night at 10 pm, not so crowded. Music playing, not too loud not too low. Servers, I'm at the bar so they don't really serve me but are attendant. Better than others in my opinion.   The reason why I wanted to give 4 stars in the first place was the small size of nigiri that they serve. A lot smaller than anywhere I've been. Even in San Francisco. And because, I'm guessing a new chef that he was mentoring behind him, kept staring making me feel uncomfortable. Not going to name names and leave it at that. But Yoshi was so polite and courteous to me, I had to give the extra star.",

My husband and I decided we wanted to have some sushi at around 930 on a Friday night. We go in and the hostess tells us there's a 45 min wait although there is one large table that's open (with a reservation). So we decide, alright, let's just take it to go. We order a few sashimi, a screaming orgasm, and 4 rolls, which came out to 80 bucks! I seriously contemplate just waiting the 45 min and having all you can eat for about $50 plus tip for the two of us.   15-20 min later, they pack up our stuff and we drive home. We get home and they give us one roll that's the wrong order and then they're missing 2. So we give them a call, they say they have the food at the counter...we don't live a minute down the street so my husband asks the manager if he can just refund us what the two rolls cost. They offer to give him a 26 dollar credit the next time we go, + another $13 and not a refund. My husband insisted that we wanted the refund and they made him drive back instead of just putting it back on his card. So he goes there and gets the refund...and, I would think for the trouble, they would just give us the two rolls we originally ordered but forgot. Nope. What horrible customer service. Even though the sushi was fine and it's the closest sushi restaurant to our place, I won't ever go back. Ugh!",

When I recently flew in to town from my new home in Salt Lake City, I called in from the airport for a large take-out order due to my craving for some great sushi. I didn't recognize the food anymore.  The fish was different...muted colors, strange unrecognizable cuts in my sashimi, much thiner portions too. Not sure if I will try it again...I was quite disappointed that an old favorite let me down.",

Come here if you're looking to for some good AYCE sushi around Vegas. The only thing I don't like about this place is that they don't have a sheet for you to fill out for AYCE. The waiter/waitress has to handwrite your order. So m, if you have a large party, try and order as much as possible the first round because it takes a while to get the food and write down your order on a phone or paper so that they can just read your order.",

    "text": "Hi, what's going on over there? So many new servers, so much turnover. If we have one hour for AYCE, the servers need to come refill our water and drinks without being asked each time. I ate half my meal recently sitting next to dirty dishes left in an empty spot. I noticed the special Creme Brulee is no longer served, just Mochi Ice Cream and Ice Cream. Still nice, but did you lose a vendor or are you cutting corners. No more Blue Fin, so sad. We used to eat there every Sunday. When there is high staff turnover and a need for training can you leave a manager or someone who can run the crew and maintain consistency? It's like a free for all over there now. Hope someone replies to this review just to explain. We were very loyal customers and really recommended SushiMon highly. Right now it seems most front end hosts and servers are very very disorganized or left untrained. I would appreciate a reply here. Too bad Arpi doesn't work on Sundays or another manager. Things are definitely slipping and we come for Tomo but could eat at Osaka or Hiro Sushi instead",

It was disappointing. I ordered the Sushi Sashimi Combination.  The tuna sashimi tased \"fishy\" so I guess was not fresh. The eel and salmon was of poor texture and did not taste very good.  Even the miso soup wasn't particularly good.  The servers are very nice and the place is pleasant, but with restaurants like Hiroba and Yuzu nearby,   I don't think I'll be back to Sushi Mon.",

Out of all the AYCE sushi places I've frequented, this one gave me the worst first impression.   The service wasn't the best as I felt like my friends and I were rushed to ordering right away after not even being seated for more than a couple of minutes. It was irritating to say the least; the server never bothered to ask us if it was our first time, nor did he do any sort of recommendations for rolls to try.  Everywhere I go, I always get salmon nigiri to see if the place is worth coming back to, and this establishment had the worst one I've ever tried. The salmon was seriously so hard I felt like I was chewing on some cold steak. The rice was too cold as well. I also tried their takoyaki and a little advice, don't even bother with it. Their lasagna roll also fell apart way too easily unlike some other places I've tried. It's also a bummer that their agedashi tofu is not part of AYCE menu. I do however like their steamed gyoza, it was really delicious, soft and fresh.   I cannot with clear conscience recommend this place to any of my friends, and I definitely would rather drive a little out of my way to get better quality sushi.",

    "text": "Been coming here for years prior to my yelp career.  Time to pay respects to Sushi Mon...man!  Service: You're greeted immediately upon walking in, and the sushi chefs at the bar have always been friendly. Wait staff keeps the drinks fresh every time I've sat for AYCE. The sushi chefs keep things moving and I've never had a problem with the wait.  They're moving quickly to get you full af asap so they can clear more covers with their limited seating.       Food: The Nigiri has always been fresh and on point with a great rice ratio.  Check the specials board because it's never failed me.  Great place to find something new to try. My particular favorites have always been the salmon belly and the fresh af Uni.  Everything is good quality and a good time.  Value: $26.95 for dinner ayce sushi.  Pretty good value for getting you a lot of good quality sushi in a short amount of time.  We rock the miso soup and dessert (Ice cream, mochi, and deep fried ice cream) that comes with the ayce option.  Ambiance:  Casual decor for your typical sushi place in a strip mall area.  Not a first date sushi place but a casual date sushi place.  There's flat screens strategically placed for diners and is brightly lit.  The tables are placed rather close to each other which I don't mind but may be an issue for others.  There's limited seating and it's a hot spot.  I'd never consider going here on a friday or saturday because I'd there's going to be a wait.  It's been my sun-thur late night ayce sushi craving go to the past 7+ years.  They close at 2 am and my visits have been usually around 10 PM on a sun-thur.  Sometimes even then it's been a 15 minute wait.  The wait is worth it, and Sushi Mon is one of those great restaurants that makes it hard to move from Vegas.  I know that at 12 AM on a wednesday night, high quality sushi is only a 15 minute drive away. Thanks for providing me a solid late night weekday sushi option Sushi Mon!",

Appetizers are always fresh and are consistent with good taste.    Timing on the food can be a hit or miss. All our food can be out within ten minutes of ordering on one visit, but takes 30-40 minutes on another visit. No explanation or apologies given whatsoever.   The issue we have with this sushi mon location is always poor customer service. I would say 9 of 10 visits, we would have poor customer service. The issues range from nobody serving us or taking our orders for anywhere between 10-20 minutes of seating us (not even drink orders), to unfriendly and at times rude service (for example, not being helpful at all when we asked about the status of our orders we placed 40 minutes ago).  We had continued to give them our business because of the food quality. But that only stretches our patience so far. We are sad to make the decision that we will not be returning to this restaurant.",

The chef is busy most of the time so it's kind of hard to ask him to make something for you when he's working on other people's orders. Seems like our server only took kitchen orders, so felt bad asking the chef to make things all the time.  The calamari here was one of my favorites. Other then awkwardly asking our chef to make something every 5 mins everything was pretty good. Sushi and rice proportion was pretty good. Smaller pieces, but at least not stuffed with rice.   Will come back if in the area. Not bad but not the best:-) recommend this place as one of the better ones.",

    "text": "Once upon a time like 10 years ago this used to be the spot to go,  especially late at night for all you can eat sushi.   As I've gotten older all you can eat sushi has lost its appeal, but late night sushi is still a very real need.   The last two times I have given in to the craving  and not wanted to drive more than a few minutes from the comfort of my home, I had come here and been severely disappointed.     Don't get me wrong I have lowered my expectations for a place who does all you can eat,  which I personally don't do.  I just get a roll or two, and had remembered they had some rolls I really liked.  However it was just just barely passable the first of the two times I went back,  and the last time I went hoping it was a fluke it was basically inedible.   This past time just walking in to get my order the place had an old fishy smell hidden under the scent of the oil from the fryer. I got the hurricane roll.  The rice was dry like it had been sitting for a while,  the fish inside it might as well have been cat food,  the salmon tempura was almost like dehydrated salmon that had been coated in a tempura batter that had no crunch at all.  It had just soaked up all the oil and become soft and spoungy. To make matters worse it was like 13 dollars for this sadness in a styrofoam container.   They also put the sauces meant to be on the roll all in different places.  One was on top,  another in the container on the side,  and the other I realized after forcing it down my throat (I felt bad my boyfriend got it for me, and didn't want to waist it) ,had been stuck in the bag itself away from the roll completely.   Honestly right across the street is Albertsons. They are open late too,  the rolls are cheaper, and even though they aren't the most amazing in the world, are still 10 times better than what I  consumed last night.  Supermarket sushi at a non Asian market should not be better than a sushi house with chefs making things to order.  This is basically a travesty, and the nostalgia I had for this place is not enough to get me to come back ever.",

This hidden gem is open til 2am and when we arrived at 9pm, the place was packed to the gills!  A good vibe of hungry and happy customers enjoying their meal.    For $26.95 (dinner price), you can get AYCE sushi!  Order anything you want off the menu which includes selections of ice cream for dessert.  Not conveyor belt style like most AYCE sushi places.......everything is made to order!   If you're sitting at the counter, the sushi chefs take your order and get right to work.   If you're seated at a table, all of the waiters are very attentive - they make sure you've got something on your plate at all times!   Good customer service makes the experience complete.    They have every kind of sushi you can imagine, and then some they've created on their own.  My particular favorite is the Volcano Roll.   Baked California roll with yum yum sauce and scallops.  Delicious!    Sushi Mon is our favorite sushi place in Vegas.  If you're willing to go off-strip, Sushi Mon is a great choice to indulge your sushi craving.",

I've ordered scallop at some other places before and a lot of times I've been disappointed by the texture or taste, but they were perfect here and the flavor was on pointI also had a mini udon and it's pretty good for a sushi spot lol. Lastly, instead of mochi ice cream.. I did the lychee sorbet. Ummm.. 100% recommend! It was sooo good!!!

As I pulled in, I remembered, I've never been here. So I gladly pulled up and parked in front of Sushi Mon. Came in and it was nice to see that even though the restaurant had just opened up a few minutes ago, people were already inside with their orders coming out.  Good sign so far.  Since I was there by myself and only two open tables, I thought it would be okay to sit at the bar. Got the menu and I was glad to see they had a bentos on their lunch menu. Btw, lunch menu is reasonably priced. I chose the simple chicken katsu and CA roll meal that was nicely priced at $7.50. Yay, that means lunch is going to be under $10, including tip.  Everything on my plate was tasty from the salad with ginger sesame salad dressing, my all-time favorite japanese potato salad and CA roll.  Because it is a lot of rice, I wasn't able to finish up the CA rolls which is fine because that meant I could have it later for dinner.  Good customer service, clean restaurant, nice atmosphere and just as important, great price! 5-stars for this lunch experience.",

I went back again but this time brought my bf to get his opinion.   The cons: Tako and tuna poke is very bland. Miso soup barely has any tofu and the seaweed is paper thin. The takoyaki is frozen as it's quite mushy when bitten into. Had quite a lot of hand rolls and it was quite bland so I decided maybe it needs to be rolls instead but it was still bland. I noticed for basic rolls, they add a bunch of other ingredients in which, imo, ruins the taste of it. For instance, Phillip roll should only have avocado, cream cheese and salmon but they add eggs and cucumber.   The pros: Nigiri sushi are yummy. They actually put less rice just like at Sushi Neko. They actually have salmon and yellowtail belly which is good. Tako wasabi was pretty good too! Green mussels was flavorful. They can pretty much make all rolls into handrolls.  So all in all, both experiences weren't that great.  IF I wanted only Nigiri, then maybe I might go there.",

The sushi tasted pretty fresh, and I had no complaints of any of the fish. All the rolls there were pretty great too. Cant remember the names of the rolls... But I really enjoyed them all!

He just left the finished sushi roll & items on the bar wout letting us know.  If I wanted buffet style attitude I would of gone somewhere else.  Usually you hand the finished sushi roll to the person. I felt it was rude and I understand u may have to turn your back to us but the entire time.  We sit at the bar for conversation & banter. Not always do we always chat but maybe someone needs a personality. Just felt he was very cold to us and needs an adjustment. I would of given a 4-5 star rating if it wasn't for the sushi chef. I give our server a 5 Star! Great Personality & always making sure our beverages were topped off. I appreciate u knowing the menu since I haven't eaten at Sushi Mon in years!",

I live on the northwest part of town and willingly travel out here whenever I want some good sushi. The bf invited me for dinner here last night and said \"hell yaa!\" without hesitation. We got the all you can eat for 26 bucks a head. Here's a list of things we ordered: seared tuna and salmon Ahi poki 'fresh' scallop Yellowtail collar Shrimp shumai Tarro(fish of the day) Super white  Eel Spicy shrimp yum yum rolls Gyoza(his order) Tempura ice cream  Our orders consisted  mostly of nigiris except the shrimp yum yum rolls because we don't like other things on the fish (like cream cheese..eck!) but anyway everything was,as usual, deliciously fresh. Well, except the scallops, it tasted a wee funny. It didn't taste as fresh as they claimed it to be. But the BEST PART was that TARRO !! I can eat three orders if it wasn't limited to one order per person! And the super white is to die for! A must frikken try! They used to limit the order for this before the tarro fish came out and now order as much as you can! Yay! We finished off with the tempura ice cream and satisfaction finally kicked in.   Overall, great food, the staff(servers) actually improved as far as the service, and definitely worth the money.",

During non-busy hours, you can actually eat longer than the regulated 60 mins but usually people are full before they hit an hour landmark.    Fishes were fresh.  Make sure to check their daily specials!  I like their fresh scallop (its previously frozen, however) but still pretty good for AYCE standard.  Uni melts in your mouth as well.  Sweet shrimp is better than typical AYCE place too.  I also liked their salmon, yellowtail, amber jack, albacore sushi.  Their tempura shrimp and seaweed salad is good too.  One of the best I have had in the AYCE restaurant.  Thumbs up.   They also make pretty good rolls, including 1/2 order rolls so for those who can't consume the whole spider roll, this is the place to go.  My only gripe for this place is that their sushi rice is bit on the firm side.  It wasn't  very \"sticky\" when I was there.  Maybe just one of the bad nights?  Their Ikura (Salmon Eggs) weren't that salty too so if you don't like fishy stuff, try to avoid that.  Other than that, its definitely worth to make a trip here if you are very hungry and loves sushi!",

    "text": "I had really high expectations for this place because it was recommended by a friend and also because of the 4 star yelp rating. I was a bit disappointed.   Overall Rating: 3.5 Stars   $26.95 for AYCE at dinner (60 minutes to eat) is not bad considering the tremendous selection they had available. They have the good stuff like toro, uni, amaebi, ikura (limit of 1 per person for the toro, uni and amaebi). There was an extensive list of nigiri, hand rolls and cut rolls and the list of cooked stuff was not too shabby at all. They even have dessert on the menu! The best part of my meal was the 2 natto hand rolls. I love natto and they rarely have natto anything at restaurants. A major plus is that they do not overload your items with rice. I know a lot of AYCE places stuff you with rice and then make you wait forever for your next item, but not this place.   The downside? The good stuff wasn't actually that good! It was just average and not very consistent. My sister told me that her first order of salmon nigiri was good and the second order was dry. Huh? My uni was not fresh, the ikura was flavorless, the amaebi was a bit slimy and the toro was not bad but it wasn't exactly melt in your mouth. Also, other random pieces of nigiri that I had were just average. I am so torn! I really wanted to like this place but it's only just ok. Even though my natto hand rolls were da bomb, I know it comes out of a box so how hard is it to screw that up?   I wouldn't mind coming here again because I love the selection. I just hope that I came on an off day and that the next time I come, I will be luckier.",

So I'm an amateur!  But I do like me some Sushi Mon.   The AYCE deal is available both for lunch ($22) and dinner ($27) and if you are planning on trying more than three rolls, this is your best bet since the prices otherwise take you over $25 real quickly. Unlike some other places, the AYCE sushi does not include miso soup, seaweed salad or a drink, just so you know.   Let's say you love sushi but your friends don't- bring them here anyway, since there are plenty of other Asian-themed dishes they can try while you grab the fish n' rice. There is a $10 \"dinner special\" with a green salad, soup, vegetable tempura, chicken teriyaki, potato salad and yes, a California roll, but your non-sushi friends can give that to you. Also, there are breaded and fried pork options, other teriyaki plates, etc.   But back to the sushi, which to me has to mean AYCE. Prepared mostly by Japanese (not always so at other places) and served very quickly once made, it has always been fresh and exactly as described on the menu, which is a big help since I'm not an expert, of course. Something new to me were the fried rolls (volcano sushi, flying Jason roll, etc.) and I could have done without them because they added lots of ballast, but it shows the creativity of the sushi masters at work. You can ask for half-rolls of most offerings, which allows you to try more types and not feel completely stuffed as you leave.  Now the place is indeed small and very popular, so you should definitely expect to spend up to 30-40 minutes waiting for a table if there are more than 2 in your party and if it's after 5 PM most days, but it is worth it. And beware- the wait staff is definitely militant about not sharing AYCE with those who order entrees and are also always on rice-wastin' patrol. Don't be the one to be called out- I've seen this happen once and it's not even funny.  What's interesting is that reviews of other sushi restaurants in the area (or even across town) often compare whatever place is being reviewed to Sushi Mon, which means it must have a standard-setting reputation among those who really know their sushi. As I said, I'm an amateur, but even so- Sushi Mon is a great place for all levels of sushi-knowledge, it seems.",

He is never pleasant when he answers the phone and lacks good customer service.

We ordered salmon, super white tuna, baked mussel some sushi rolls.. They are all good n fresh! Make sure to order the super white tuna!! i didn' know they carry white tune so i was pretty excited about it and hey good thing i ordered it!  Probably the best thing you'll ever try in acye sushi!!  Veryy good!

Mine was empty for 5 minutes before they came to refill it.  I was enjoying my calamari and my Volcano Roll. I then ordered a deep-fried roll which I had never tried before, and stopped when I pulled a long hair out of a piece of my sushi. I completely lost my appetite and won't be returning.

I've tried other AYCE places and they never compare to Sushi Mon. Great selection of fish and the absolute best part is they will make any roll they offer into a hand roll and they'll customize it for you.  I've been to other restaurants that look at you like you're crazy for even asking.  They never pressure you about the 1 hour time limit,  and the service is very good considering how busy they are.  My suggestion is don't bring small children that don't enjoy any form of Japanese food, the place is super busy to have to manage a baby and frustrating for fellow diners. (rant over) can't recommend this place enough and can't wait to go back.",

Customer service here is just bad! Came here at about 10ish at night on a Thursday to meet up with my brothers. As soon as I walked through the door and was about to sit down, my brother said that the male servers already had given them a hard time. It was originally just my brothers that were  gonna have sushi and they invited me to join them. They told the guy server that they were adding one more person and the server said \"why didn't you tell me earlier that you were adding on more person?!\" My brothers then replied telling him that \"I just literally got off the phone and it wasn't even planned!\" So the server moved my brothers to a bigger table. (Strike one!)   So they ordered 5mins prior to my arrival. And the server took my order as well. The first two orders came on and the other male server just dropped it down on our table like he was sorta throwing it towards us and told us what it was. He also had an order for the table next to us and he placed their order nicely on their table and explaining nicely to them what their order was. (Strike two!!)  The rest of food came and ate, ordered more trying to pace ourselves. The thing that bothered us also was that it took awhile for the server(s) to come take our orders and clean the plates off and refill our water. And it wasn't even that busy. (Strike three!)  All in all our experience there was terrible. Don't get me wrong but the food was good and the service sucked! The only one we thought was decent was the one female server. I think it's time for me to boycott this place too! I don't think I'll ever return!",

I checked the website and nowhere does it state \"last seating at 1am\" she still told me I was wrong and said have a good night practically pushing me out the door.  Not once did she say sorry or offer any type of manners towards me and my party.  I messaged management and they apologized for her but sadly after years of attending this establishment, her snarky attitude and complete disrespect to myself and my wife has lost them business.  Also noted by others that attended that establishment who I'm told will be writing reviews about her as well.  Simple adjustments can get this restaurant its stars back.",

This is a small space so there's usually a line outside for tables.   Luckily there was 1 table available and we snagged it. 2 of us ordered a la carte and 2 of us had all you can eat.   The AYCE menu was quite expansive, and somewhat overwhelming. We ordered mainly nigiri for the AYCE for more bang for our buck.  The nigiris were on the mini side, but good proportion of fish to rice. Depending on how you order, rolls can come as half rolls or whole rolls.  This I appreciate because you can try a large variety of rolls. They also have a specials menu that included blue fin, bonito, and other Japanese named fish I can't remember.  The AYCE also included a dessert menu with ice cream, mochi, and deep fried ice cream.   For a la carte, I ordered a niku udon because I'm allergic to seafood.  It came with a salad and CA roll. The udon broth was quite salty and I suspect made from some kind of concentrate. There was quite a large portion of beef, which was pleasantly surprising.  But it was A LOT of beef. I wish there was some kind of greenery, like spring onion, to cut through.   The service was great. The wait staff were quite attentive to us and there wasn't a moment where the table was empty.  We never really waited too long to refill AYCE. and the orders came out promptly.",

There's an entire section of lunch priced foods that are under $10 and comes with salad and miso soup. And they serve you orange cubes post meal. Tough not to go with the AYCE option but this actually filled me up.  Get: - beef lunch special (teriyaki beef, 4 pieces California roll, miso soup, house salad, scoop of rice)",

    "text": "I come here often with my mom to do the AYCE special. The employees are all very friendly, from the servers to the chefs. We like to sit at the sushi bar, and I always suggest doing so to get the best service.  There are so many options on what you can order. There are rolls, nigiri, side dishes, and salads. Don't forget you can order the special items on the board too! I did not know that my first time.  I don't think the quality of fish really stands out. I've had a lot of sushi and this would probably fall under average. However, it is one of the best I've had for AYCE outside of Japan. I generally prefer to have a small, high quality meal when eating sushi, but when I am really hungry and rather go for quantity, I'd come here.",

    "text": "This place is awesome! Great food, amazing and fast service. I love sushi salmon. And I mean, loooove. Salmon nigiris have always been just alright for me, since most sushi places I go to put 3-4x more rice to fish and I could barely taste the salmon. This place, however, gave me an amazing ratio of salmon to rice. More salmon than rice! Twice we've been here and they had ayce* salmon belly nigiri as their special. What a deal! Another salmon dish I like is their supreme salmon roll, where it is salmon in a sushi roll with salmon on top. The rolls have a nice portion of rice as well, so no way do you eat more rice than fish. It had been a while since I had great food and service, and it was truly appreciated. The servers were very attentive. There were at least 3 who attended to our table alone. Amazing how it's not just one server per area, but they all worked together to attend to every table when needed. Now that's teamwork! Not just that, but they don't ignore you after a while, like some places, just so time passes by and you feel the fullness to the point you stop ordering. Also, their dessert is unlimited! Very nice to know that that is an option for their customers.  Only con I found was once you step in the place, it smells slightly of sewage water, probably a restroom problem, but your sense of smell adapts to it after a while. Other than that, great place to eat ayce. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "We ordered takeout and really had high hopes for the food here because of the reviews!  We ordered two 2 roll specials (which include miso soup and a salad), three specialty rolls and a side order of gyoza.  When we received our order, we discovered the combo rolls were packed incorrectly which was inconvenient since each order belonged to someone different.  The special sauce for one of my husbands rolls was packed in the gyoza box which gave me a surprisingly extra spicy surprise when I tried dipping my food in it.  The rolls were dry and did not taste fresh at all.  My friend said that the breadcrumbs on top of her roll tasted really stale and my husband at all of 3 pieces total because he said the taste was not good at all.  The miso soup was quite tasty and the gyoza was up to par.  I don't think I will return though as I have experienced much better tasting sushi around town.",

    "text": "AYCE sushi is the best bang for your buck when you're able to consume more food than a starving college student. Now that i've been finished with school my ability to consume half the oceans supply of fish has greatly diminished but nonetheless I still can hammer time quite a fair amount of sushi.  Atmosphere/service: Fairly busy with an attentive sushi bar but as for the male wait staff it could be much better.  The decor resembles that of an older sushi restaurant that's been in business and Sushi mon has definitely been one of the lasting pioneers for sushi.  Food: I only eat nigiri and will share a roll with a friend. That being said, the quality of the fish is more important and essentially thats what sushi is, is the nigiri. I'm a yellowtail fiend and typically the first 2 orders are incredibly fresh with a beautiful dark pink to clear color. The chefs here are Japanese trained and cut the nigiri with just the right amount of thickness and low rice to fish ratio. They have implemented a new white chef who (no offense) cuts the nigiri poorly.  Overall: Quiet nights when I just want to enjoy sushi alone, this is the place I choose. Fresh nigiri, professional sushi chefs, and proximity to my home makes this a winner",

    "text": "After trying so many Sushi places in town and having a hankering for really good Sushi, I decided to bring the family to Sushimon as it is one of the best places according to so many people.  I wanted to try some excellent sushi.  Here at Sushimon, note:  1. The wait - You are gonna wait for a table.  We came at 1:45 and got to sit down at 2:35.  A bit of a wait, however, they use a really good waitlist system online to notify you when your table is ready.  Although we waited a bit over 45 minutes, it is what we were quoted and we were able to hang out at the Starbucks for a while, so that made the wait worth it.  2.  The food - Besides, the normal speciality rolls, I ordered the Black Tobiko, The Salmon Belly, and the Sanma (Pike Makerel) from their special of the day menu.  I decided that I wanted Amai-ebi, Uni and also hamachi kama so they told me I had to pay the dinner menu price which is 26.95.  I was good with that.  3. Very good food, no problems as it is fresh and tasty.  4. The service - This was a huge issue for sure.  I went with the dinner menu at lunch to have the Amai-Ebi, Uni and Hamachi-Kama.  I did not get the shrimp fried heads from the Amai-Ebi and I never got the Hamachi-Kama.  Since I did get part of the shrimpt and the Uni, they advised me that they would charge me the dinner price.  I get that, and no problem at all. i was full, they would have made the items for me had I demanded, however waiting 40 minutes for these items I got full and decided to pass.  I thought it was decent for them to offer to cook it even though we were there past the 45 minute limit for all you can eat. I did not care for the fact that they said that if I wanted the heads with the Amai-Ebi it is a separate order. I was kind of shocked at that as I don't believe that is normal. However, that is my mistake. If you want the heads, be sure to order it.  5.  The service again - What is not the greatest at this place is the pace of their service.  Wavering between 100% full and 75% full, the service is extremely slow.  The waiters you have to flag down, they don't check in with you often.  The serving of rice is quite a bit on the nigiri sushi and I think the only way you can get your money's worth is to order enough the first time.  If you want an accurate order, you will need to have them repeat it back and then confirm all the bits and pieces that you want to make sure that this is what you are expecting.  Good food, fresh food, mediocre to good service and oddities in their menu and what they include is what this place is all about. Overall, I probably will try out some other places or go back to my regular places. I was not as impressed as I thought for a quality place with a waiting list to get it.  I will for sure adjust my ordering the next time I go there and be very diligent to make sure I get what I ordered and paid for.  Good place to go, just be careful.",

    "text": "I imagine in the desert it is difficult to get fresh, good quality sushi.. we decided to try this because our 8 year old really wanted a california roll and it was close to where we were staying.. but the second we sat down my husband saw the all you can eat option, not generally a good sign.. but we were exhausted. So my son got the all you can eat because he wanted gyoza, shrimp tempura and a California roll. Ordering those individually would cost more. He got his food right away, roll looked good, gyoza looked ok and shrimp were skinny and sad looking. He ate all the roll and all but one of the gyoza and left a few shrimp. My husband had a sashimi plate, a seaweed salad, the salad was fine but sashimi huge pieces cut halfway through, no flavor .. he left half of each uneaten. I tried the sashimi salad, upon arrival I knew it wasn't going to be great. Big cuts of sashimi in general means low quality fish, this fish had no taste and was dry, and much of the salad was wilted and no longer edible.  I am sure it is the best they can get to turn around and sell it at a reasonable price in the desert. Our fault really and for those who don't have access to fresh or higher quality the size and price may be enough.. for us it just wasn't good.",

    "text": "My wife and I recently found ourselves in Las Vegas late one night and we were hungry. I asked our Valet for a good sushi place close to our hotel that was also all you can eat, and after some thought they called for a stout guy also working the valet who is supposedly their go to guy for sushi joints. Once I started talking to this guy i knew we were cut from the same cloth, so we looked up Sushi Mon and headed out. We found Sushi Mon quickly, it was only a few miles south east of the strip in a nice sized mini-mall. The wait was about 30 minutes for dinnertime on a Friday night, and it wasn't long before we got our seat at the bar. We immediately ordered and soon after the sushi rolls started (pardon the pun) rolling in. O.K I am not gonna describe each and every roll, since we ended up having a lot but here are my highlights. The menu and specials boards had quite a lot of choices, I went for the slightly different examples for myself while my wife started with sashimi. Most my rolls were good, especially the ones with the orgasm sauce on it. It was so good we ended up getting a couple sides of the sauce which seemed like mayo and ponzu with a couple secret ingredients to boot. The sashimi was a whole different story, the tuna and tuna belly both had a very nasty metallic taste that worried us so much we refused to eat it the rest of the night. We also ordered a couple real crab rolls that came to us 90% frozen (crabsicle) I also ordered the takoyaki which was o.k and the udon soup which also was just o.k. I guess it is hard to keep everything at a high level when doing such a high volume at an all you can eat place, so next time we are just sticking to the rolls. Service was pretty good on a busy night, prices were fair and food was o.k as long as we stuck with rolls and appetizers, Aloha",

I've had it before and it was good (much milder). This most recent trip our table ordered a 911 roll (8 pcs) as we like spicy. But this was insanely HOT!!!!  I bit my piece in 1/2. That was it....it almost ruined the rest of my meal. It was so INSANELY HOT, I joked it should now come with a warning label. The next table ordered it as well. Our table heard that and thought...Oh! You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. That poor mans face looked like he was in so much pain after eating a piece. He turned bright red and was grabbing for his water (which doesn't help, it seemed to just increase the intensity when I did the same thing) Anyways you have been warned. LoL!!",

    "text": "I have such a hard time talking about this place. It's not my favorite place to go to but then it again it has some items that I absolutely love there. So let's talk about what I normally order and we'll go from there.  Salmon collar: Yepp, you read it right, salmon collar. This is the only place in Vegas that I know of that has this dish and when it's done correctly, it's so fabulous. Salmon collar is the cheek of the salmon. So you get this salmon flavor fatty part that is just so tender and literally melts in your mouth. It's done with a miso glaze here and again, when it's right (not too salty, which is usually most of the time) is just delicious. I swear  by this dish with a side of white rice, very asian of me. I will admit that I will come here just for this dish.  Green salad: Oh yah. I don't know what is in the dressing but it's one of my favorite dressing. I usually order a side of it to take home because I'll dress all my salads with this dressing if I could. So bright and refreshing.  Shrimp head miso: It's not on the menu so you gotta tell them shrimp head miso. It just adds just the right about of brine and salt to the miso. You don't have to eat the shrimp head but it's worth the try. You're in Vegas, right?  Nebakyaki udon: Served in a clayish pot and pretty darn good. I love udon but there's something different about it that makes me crave it. And when I crave udon, this is the udon that will cure my cravings. The only thing that I still find soooooooooooo odd and needs to be changed is, you CANNOT have this to go. I guess it's that hard for the owners to order big to go cups. I hope changes soon because I would have this soup more often if I could take it home.  All baked rolls: Okay, I going to let you all in on a small secret, I don't eat anything raw. I know, I know, don't judge me. But the good news is I can tell you that about the cooked stuff. No? Still not a good excuse? Well, deal with it. But, again, all the baked sushi is good there. Sometimes you just want to be unhealthy and break the cycle and have some cream cheese on my sushi. Speaking of, try the Frying Jason roll, one of my favorites here.  Now, the not so fun part, SERVICE. Where is the customer service? This place is the worst when it comes to service, minus the sushi chefs. ALL the servers there are so incompetent. They never seem to know whose section is whose. We get asked for water at least twice, I guess it's better than nothing, no one comes to check on you and you HAVE TO FIND anyone if you want to order more food, especially when you have the all you can eat. I wish they were just hire people that knew how to be servers. You're job is to be helpful, bring food to the table and check up on your guest, is it that hard for you to do? You're not in a fine dining restaurant, can you at least manage to be helpful?  If this place didn't have the few items that I can't seem to find at any other sushi place, I wouldn't come here. But, if you're lucky and come when there's no lunch or dinner rush, you'll find this place to be just that, okay.  Ciao and until next time, happy eating everyone :)",

I'm not a sushi aficionado by any means, so this review will just cover the standard fare. The tempura is fresh and piping hot, therefor yummy. The age gyoza is great. Beef bowl is a delish winner, and the teriyaki bowls also have sliced asparagus, a perfect addition. The big complaint I have is how busy and popular they are! They take reservations, and it's a must have on weekends, unless you enjoy waiting for an empty table. They also do a great to-go business, so if you are like me, you call and order, then pick it up, and avoid how busy they can be.",

I yelped it, and it looked try worthy.  This place is not bad at all.  You can't beat the price for all you can eat sushi in Vegas.  I was seated at the bar and was given a brief explanation of how the all you can eat works.  The waitress suggested that I order small because whatever I don't eat, I will have to pay for in addition to the all you can eat price.  Also, you have to eat the rice and the fish (sounds obvious, but I do know of people who would hide the rice and just eat the fish).  Also, you can order half rolls (4 pieces instead of 8), so you can eat more of a variety.  There is also a 1 hour time limit... so no pulling Man v. Food all day here.    I ordered and ordered because I was determined to get my money's worth.  I had the sweet shrimp (only 1 order per person), snow crab hand rolls, crab sticks, garlic tuna (my least favorite), halibut, some kind of variation on the a shrimp roll with avocado, more snow crab, the hottest 911 roll I have ever had (I couldn't feel my tongue-- it was awesome), and more halibut.  I was stuffed, but determined to finish my last hand roll when I was asked by Jun (one of the sushi chefs) if I wanted anything else.  I told him I was tapping out.  I had fought the good fight... then he offers dessert.  I'm not one to turn down sugar, but I don't think I could have looked at more food much less ate it.    My bill was about $30 with my plum wine.  The only reason I couldn't give this place 5 starts is because I've had fresher fish elsewhere at an all you can eat.  Of course, this was in Cali.",

The restaurant is not too big so sometimes there is a long wait, but if you don't mind eating at the sushi bar you are good to go. I recommend the Pastel and Spider for cut rolls. Cajun albacore is a delight as well. If you don't do the all you can eat the pricing is very reasonable. If you do the all you can eat do not leave without ordering the Yellow Tail Collar. It is a delicacy and I highly recommend it. The dinner all you can eat is only $26.95 and it comes with sides a plenty. Will come back here over and over again.",

This was my go to place for AYCE sushi...when I lived on this side of town, I would come all the time, and even after I moved, I would make the 45min drive for excellent and fresh sushi.  I have ran into a new favorite though, which is still a sister company of sushimon, and a little more centrally located.  So what makes sushimon one of the best in town?  Fresh fish, fast service, and most importantly, YELLOWTAIL COLLARS!  Yellowtail collars are easily one of the best fish pieces I have ever consumed.  In the AYCE setup, you are limited to one, but it is what makes me drive all the way out here...it is seriously that good.  You HAVE to order it, especially if you go with the AYCE menu.  One of the most tender parts of the fish and packed with flavor.  I am a nigiri kind of guy, although we do order rolls every once in a while, but everything I have came into contact with is super tastey and fresh.  They have plenty of sides to order as well, such as tempura options and baked mussels.  They also have good deals on pitchers of Sapporo which is a nice touch.  Give it a go!",

I've waited and been happy with it, but it still sucks to wait over an hour for your delicious sushi.   On the plus side, this place has so many rolls and they do a great job mixing and matching the different fish options and the sauces. They also do specials that have proven to be pretty incredible (check out the posted specials on signs throughout the restaurant). It's pretty tiny in there and it does get a little cramped at your table with your 10,000 lbs of AYCE deliciousness.   As a HUGE bonus (wish I could give extra half stars!), dessert and appetizers are also AYCE so you can have as many mochi as your little heart desires. I once had a friend who came in and ordered ONLY mochi (no fish!) for the whole meal. No a lot of places can get away with that :) Also, they're open pretty late, so when the hunger strikes, you can get your sushi on.   Favorite rolls include: Super white tuna (BEST EVER), Lasagna Roll, Crispy Rice Roll, J.J. Roll, Pastel, Rock n Roll, and the Moment Roll.",

As we have since expanded our search to other local spots around town, it's taken a serious hit on the sushi meter as it just cannot compare anymore.  While their nigiri remains high in quality and freshness (albeit the portions have gotten noticeably smaller), their rolls are not particularly interesting. A great deal of the rolls contain crab stick which irks me. A lot of \"crab,\" a lot of cucumber, a lot of tuna. Nothing different or special. They are also very dry. This negatively impacts the experience if you're not feasting on AYCE nigiri alone, as I've sometimes been tempted to do.   Our chef didn't seem too enthusiastic either. I hate sitting at the sushi bar feeling like I'm bothering he chef. I'm aware the chef-customer dynamic is different in AYCE than in traditional and authentic sushi settings, but maybe a smile when we order? Perhaps asking once or twice if we'd like anything else?   It's nice having a choice for all those late-night sushi cravings, but Sakana still wins in my book for best AYCE in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "A big group of us (16) made a trip out to Utah to do some hiking and on the way back to LA some people suggested we make pitstop at Sushi Mon for lunch. As an LA native, I tend to stear clear of any AYCE unless it's Korean BBQ because it's always sub-par in regards to quality and service, but Sushi Mon proved to be the contrary.  Some of my favorite items: scallop sushi | salmon belly | yellowtail belly | salmon | white tuna | salmon roe with quail egg | albacore | seaweed salad | cucumber salad | custom handroll (spicy tuna with avocado and quali egg)   Not only was the fish quality better that I expected, but the service was absolutely top notch. I was worried a party of 16 was going to be overwhelming, but our server (I forget her name) never flinched and got our ever expanding orders perfectly and it didn't take forever either.  I will definitely make a point to visit Sushi Mon the next time I'm in or passing through Vegas and you should too!",

Their salmon is good but I didn't really enjoy the albacore and the halibut. I did the all you can eat. The lychee ice cream was amazing and the portion was even better. Our server came to us once for our drink order and our first order and was no where to be found. Later I found out that he'd left without a word and there was no other server that helped us as a replacement for him. It was busy but there was no wait, if I would've been at least able to put in another order I would've been happy.",

I came here for dinner with a group of friends, and we all decided to enjoy the sushi buffet for $26.95/person.   We ordered some rolls as soon as we sat down.  The rolls came out within 5 minutes, which is really fast.  Everything tasted fresh and really delicious.  I love how there isn't a lot of rice on the sushi, too.  Its great that we can order half rolls, so we got to try more items.  My favorites were the following: 1. Grilled Yellowtail Collar - the fish was cooked to perfection.  The fish fell off the bone and it was juicy.  I really liked the dipping sauce which gave it more flavor.  2. Seaweed salad - tasty  3. Lychee Sherbet - I've never had this before, but it was really good.  The sherbet tasted like lychee, and it wasn't too sweet.  4. Spider roll - The roll was pretty big, and the soft shell crab was good.  Overall, service was great.  Even though it may be a bit pricey, its definitely worth it!  I can't wait to come back when I'm in Vegas again.",

We ordered specials on the chalk board first, because they are always fresh and good. The yellowtail collar appetizer was great. I felt like I was back in japan in a small izakaya.   We only order nigiri sushi because we love fish. Seared tuna, seared salmon and fresh scallop were our favorites of the day. Their fish is always very fresh and as good as being in japan. They sometimes get rice either not cooked right or the chef did not roll it tight enough, and rice can fall apart. However , we hit the good night and all nigiri made were near perfect.  We tried other AYCE sushi places, but this place is the best among them!",

Terrible muscle texture obviously they don't know how to cut fish.. all the fish was served on warm-hot temp. Rice - terrible! Your fish is being cooked by the rice it was hot enough..  By far worst sushi in vegas I've had yet other than grocery store sushi.. go to blue fin or Osaka or really anywhere else..  My favorite thing about sushi Mon is that it is PACKED!!!

However, after standing around for 15 minutes at the counter and having some rude people cut in line to get a table, I went to the front to ask the host where I can write down my name.  He just answered that the wait was 40 minutes to an hour.  He was quite rude and didn't even make eye contact with me.  When I asked how the person that just came got a table, he just repeated that he was very busy.    The sushi bar had 5 chairs available so I asked if I could sit there.  He then looked at me and said that there are tons of people waiting.  I look around and there are 3 others.  Oh yeah, there were three others that were waiting before me and when they saw the line cutters get their seats, they left immediately without saying a word.  I on the other hand left using some expletives.   The fish might be good but I don't need to be mistreated and will take my business somewhere else.",

Luckily, someone close to me was a bit more worldly in that department and so one fine day after smoking a lot of \"tobacco\" a hunger came over me like none I had ever experienced, so I agreed to try sushi.  That first experience was at Sushi Mon and my life has never been the same.  I think it's rather cute/funny/entertaining that they make you read the \"rules\" of all-you-can-eat before hand.  Some of the rules include \"your hour begins when you get your first dish,\" \"if you leave rice on your plate you will be charged the individual amount of that particular item on top of the AYCE charge\" etc., etc...  I see many people complaining about wait times here.  I have experienced that as well and yes, that is a pain but, that is also a good sign for any restaurant, in my opinion.  Now that I'm a bit more experienced in the sushi department, I can honestly say that I have yet to see a sushi roll selection that rivals that of Sushi Mon.  Who knew that such a great sushi establishment could exist in the middle of the desert!  Thank you, Sushi Mon, for making my first sushi eating experience a good one!!",

    "text": "One hour for all-you-can-eat sushi? Game on.  There's always a wait here, and for good reason. At less than $30 for all the sushi you can possibly want, it's certainly a fantastic deal, as long as you order right. We went for literally all nigiris. The uni and amaebi is one order per person max, but everything else you can place multiple orders of. My favorites were the yellowtail belly, the mackerel, and the super white tuna. There are also lots of appetizers (seaweed salad, miso soup, etc.), and desserts as well (mochi ice cream anyone?).  This place is a must-visit for me whenever I'm in town, if only for the sheer knowledge that I am having awesome sushi in the middle of a desert. Oh Vegas.",

    "text": "Sushi Mon has a special place in my heart. When I came to Vegas in 2005 I had never had sushi before and thus is the place I went to try it. Funny enough, it is also the first place my wife ate sushi, and back then, we didn't even know each other. Anyway, to me, this is one of my favorite places. I always get along with the chefs, they are very fast, the rolls are good, and the fish is fresh. What more could I ask? The price is pretty standard for an AYCE. You really can't go wrong here.",

    "text": "Every time anyone asks about sushi or wants to know where to get good sushi, I always refer them to Sushimon.   Now, don't get me wrong, this place is not perfect. However having tried more than a few spots in town, and seen the many gimmicks put up by other places, Sushimon remains my favorite sushi spot.   All the negatives that people mention about this place are technically  True  - This place is not close to the strip. - The wait time can be long(sometimes topping out at 1 hour + - The restaurant is smallish.  However, if you're visiting Vegas, and really want good sushi, is it  that horrible to drive an extra 10 minutes to not have to deal with casino parking, not have to walk a mile and a half to get to the place, and not deal with the absurd prices you often find at restaurants on the strip?  I've often found, that any restaurant, be it big or small that can produce a full house and wait, is doing something right.  Sushimon doesn't offer you fine dining service. It's not going to blow you away with it's superior service.  I don't know about you guys, but I really don't think that matters.  If you're getting AYCE Sushi, you already have an idea of what kind of sushi you want, and what your preference is.  All the server's I've seen at Sushimon are good at getting the food out, and keeping the drinks full.  You could go to some dirty place in the middle of a bad neighborhood and get Sushi for $4-5 cheaper, sure.  But Sushimon offers almost their entire menu on their AYCE and All-you-can-eat Dessert as well.   I know a lot of places mark off menu items and only offer you one dessert.  Things I LOVE from Sushimon  Nigiri: - Hamachi (Yellowtail) - Salmon - Super White Tuna - Unagi  Other offerings: - Hamachi Collar(most places don't offer this, and they sometimes run out, but if they have, order it!) - Salmon Collar -All the rolls(and 1/2 rolls for almost all of them if you want to try the roll without getting too full, again something most places don't offer) -Uni(Sea Urchin) (one per person) -Ama Ebi(sweet Shrimp) (also one per person)  Dessert(AYCE) -Mochi Ice Cream (Strawberry/Vanilla) -Green Tea, Red Bean, and Lychee Ice Cream - Tempura Ice cream  Sure you could in theory find a cheaper place than this, in a more \"glamorous\" location, but if I'm gonna shell out $20+ for a meal, I don't mind paying a little bit more knowing that my meal is going to be good. Sushimon offers you a large menu to choose from, speedy service, and most importantly, consistency. I've been here at least a dozen times, and haven't once had a bad experience.   In case anyone is wondering, they DON'T do call ahead seating, so you have to arrive in person to get your party on the list.",

    "text": "I'm not a fan of sushi (too filling) but I love sashimi.  With sushi, restaurants can get away with less-than-fresh fish by adding sweet things to it like gravy, etc. (I don't think the authentic Japanese restaurants never do this so if you find sweet gravy or sauce on your sushi, that's probably not authentic Japanese or the fish tastes stale on its own).  With sashimi, there's no getting away with stale fish.  I loved my Sushi Mon experience today because the Sashimi Dinner was reasonably priced (about $13) for the ample serving they provide, the service was great, and the fish was delectably fresh.  Additional notes:  It's hard to get a table at Sushimon -  and I live about 10 minutes away, so lately I've found it practical to order takeout by phone. The food is just as good.",

    "text": "Lots of positives. They're open late, you can order half rolls to get more variety, service is pretty quick. There's plenty of cooked stuff for those adverse to raw fish.  We arrived at around 9:30 on a weekday and the restaurant was still at least half full. We were seated quickly, and we noticed a sign saying we only had 1 hour, so we ordered hot tea and a few rolls literally right as we sat down. Our waitress put our order in, and we got some more time to take a closer look at the menu.   Round 1 comes, and we order our round 2 right away. Then round 3 and 4 fairly soon after that. By round 4, our waitress said to us \"you guys know the rules, right? no leftover rice?\" Us: uhh... I think so? Waitress: you guys still have a monster roll coming Us: yea, we know  Hahahaha, she wasn't rude about it, but more shocked at how much we were ordering. We read over the rules, just in case, and asked her about the 1 hr rule. She said we were okay, they just don't allow customers to sit for 30 mins before ordering again. We continued for several more rounds, and then even ordered 2 rounds of dessert. I loved the green tea ice cream, but the lychee sherbet was a close second.  The fish was pretty decent. Ami ebi was awesome, and so was the yellowtail collar (warning, you can only have 1 order per person of these). Plenty of variety, and definitely worth the $27.",

The terrible texture pretty much killed my appetite. Also, there was a hair in the dipping sauce that came with my shrimp tempura. I noticed that a majority of the sushi chefs were Hispanic rather than Japanese? Uhhh don't know if that affected anything, but I'm hoping it was just an off night for them.",

It comes with the soup salad and rice. Bargain of the century for those on a low budget. They also give you hot or cold green tea at no extra charge. You can't beat this place value and excellent quality. They open late until 1 AM I believe is the last call. They also include ayce desserts!",

My Husband and I went here twice in three days!!!  Over $100 in all you can eat sushi over two days and it was soooo worth it!!!  Mind you, we went twice with big groups so we got to try a TON of stuff so the list of stuff we have tried verses haven't is pretty significant!!!  Lol!!!  I didn't try one thing that I didn't like and/or love except for one thing!!!  I had the Green Salad and the Dressing was awesome and fresh so yummy!!!  The Baked Green Mussels I could have eaten about two or three trays of them!!! They were cheesey, sweet, and tasted like the sea!!!  Loved them!!! Never knew I liked Mussels as much as I did until today!!!  We had the Fried Shumai and that was interesting.  It tasted nice with the crunchy outside and the shrimp inside that was soft.  We had the Calamari and it was soft and not tough and very flavorful!!!  Another huge stand out was the Cajun Albacore Nigiri!!! Those I ate so much of!!! They are one of the best things on the menu!!!  So different in taste and so good!!!  We also had the Albacore, Yellowtail Belly, Yellowtail, Shrimp, Salmon, Red Snapper, Tuna, Yum Yum Scallop, and Surf Clam in Nigiri.  Loved it all!!!  So fresh and it was good with the Spicy Mayo or just plain Soy Sauce!!!  The Dynamite I was so scared to try and it was another thing I could have had serving after serving of!!!  Tons of Seafood in it and just so yummy!!! Literally the name speaks for itself!!!  Also, had the Vegetable Tempura and it was ok not the best just ok.  It would have been nice to have a good sauce like the traditional Ponzu with Daikon Radish.  We had the Garlic Edamame and those are the best seasoned ones I have ever had!!!  We tried the Strawberry Mochi, Lychee Ice Cream, and the Fried Tempura Ice Cream for dessert.  The Strawberry Mochi was great and the Fried Tempura Ice Cream was to die for!!!  So simple and good and just blow you out of the water delicious!!! The Lychee Ice Cream was the one thing I was not liking very much.  However, that honestly was just a preference thing not that it was bad just that I personally don't like it.  Finally, If they had one of these in Utah I would easily be there once every two weeks or more EASY!!! The sushi scene in Utah is so lame compared to this place!!! If they had one in Utah they would be booked all day everyday no joke!!! Please move one out here I am BEGGING you!!!  I can't afford to travel five hours every time I need sushi!!! Jk!!!  Basically, my new favorite place of all time and they need to have like a 10 out of 5 stars!!!",

I was surprised the wait was so long but after going I could see why and plan to bring friends to try this place out the next time we are in Vegas :]  The service was great (I compared it to busy KBBQ spots) and the sushi was so fresh. We ordered a lot of the sashimi but surprisingly the sweet shrimp and ecstasy rolls were really good.   The prices were also great. The bento box we ordered for the youngest person at our table was $9.95 and included miso soup, salad, tempura, white rice, California rolls and teriyaki chicken.

I told the lady I was just going to order some garlic ademame for my daughter she said okay.

The restaurant is kind of small and we were seated at the bar so we had to squeeze in next to other people.   Our sushi chef who took care of us was really nice and the service was quick. I really enjoyed their tuna & garlic tuna nigiri! Can't complain about the fish to rice ratio.   Dinner price is about $26.95. They also give you a stamp card! Pretty cool since I've never been to a sushi restaurant that offers that.   The only thing that bothered me was the person sitting next to us at the bar. He was rushing the sushi chef because he \"had somewhere to be.\" If you're in a rush don't eat at a restaurant? Try a drive thru instead.",

She then leaves to break without telling us that she is leaving. We didn't know who was supposed to serve us now. After receiving some food which we didn't order we asked where our server was and was told by Zach that she went on break. Nice to know. Thanks. I'm them informed that only a la carte restaurants let there customers know when they are going on break. Wow! Zach then continues to just make excuses why Anna didn't say anything before leaving. Cool whatever. I ask for a manager and Jennie the host says that there isn't a manager on duty that they are the only ones there to help also we had a guest that can read lips and sees Jennie say\"these fuking people\" to one of the other servers. Unbelievable! Unmanaged servers who like to argue with customers. Never coming here again that's for sure! Food was good service sucks!",

    "text": "I've ignored this place in favor of sister restaurant Sushi House Goyemon for too long. It may be an equal or superior experience.  Sushi Mon on Maryland is one of my favorites from back when I did AYCE (all you can eat) sushi multiple times a month if not a week. In case you're not familiar with Las Vegas, the AYCE sushi scene is huge and prepared to order, not buffet style. Goyemon and this older restaurant have identical menus (including AYCE dessert - that 1 per person limit at many restaurants is a pet peeve), but I always recalled Goyemon having a larger offering of special nigiri and appetizers.  Sushi Mon has almost caught up in specials variety since my last visit a few years back. I don't have a photo, but the nigiri included a hefty array of nigiri, including yuzu tobiko, seared bonito, and other ignored options. I tried and loved the blue fin tuna, salmon belly, yellowtail belly, and masaba (a variety mackerel that's far less salty). A full meal of those would've been more than satisfying.  From the aforementioned specials menu, I also enjoyed these nigiri: Japanese mackerel, toro (1 per person), young yellowtail, red grouper, and asari rayu, asari being Japanese littleneck clams and rayu being chili-infused sesame oil. The Japanese mackerel was rather salty like regular saba, the toro wasn't substantially better than the blue fin, the young yellowtail and red grouper were similar to regular yellow tail and red snapper, respectively, and the asari rayu was a bit more spicy than I would've tolerated if I'd eaten a full piece (but it does taste pretty good).  I don't recall Goyemon favorites such as spicy tuna rice cracker, sashimi salad, grilled pork belly, and fresh \"wasabi\" (I'm told it's not actual wasabi, but it's similar) being available at Sushi Mon before, but they were available and at least as good if not better. The pork belly at Goyemon has actually been significantly overcooked almost every time over the past year, but the pork belly in this meal was fatty, juicy, and only slightly overcooked on edges. Some grilled items which I missed from Goyemon are cajun salmon, miso salmon, yellowtail, and super white tuna, but I was more than willing to overlook those after having the best yellowtail collar from either 'Mon. (Salmon collar was also available, and both were 1 per person.)  The standard menu appetizers were also as enjoyable as usual. Dynamite (bay scallop, \"crab\" filling, onions, cream sauce) and atypically large mussels were great. As for standard nigiri, I enjoyed the super white tuna, hotate (sea scallop), and amaebi as much as I have at Goyemon or other AYCE establishments in town. Uni was slightly subpar, but I've had far more unpalatable experiences at similar spots.  As far as dessert, standard menu green tea was as awesome as usual, although some unusual ice was present around, but not inside. This stuff actually has matcha, unlike some competitors. I also had pineapple sorbet, which is as delicious as you'd expect, and a cream puff, which was enjoyable and packed full of vanilla cream. That's the first time that I've seen those desserts available at a 'Mon.  Wait was about half an hour for Friday night peak dinner. Dress accordingly for the weather if you're not able to come here during off-peak times. Cost for AYCE meals is $19.95 for lunch, $26.95 for dinner. Time limits are written as 45 and 60 minutes respectively, but still aren't really enforced except for special occasions. Most rolls are available in half orders, although I completely ignored rolls this time as I often do.  Sushi Mon remains in my top tier of Las Vegas's AYCE sushi (along with Goyemon and Sushi Koma), but I may be naming it as my new favorite soon enough if I experience enough delicious meals. I do hope to visit more often because it's more convenient for me than Goyemon is (although the latter is still 4.5* at least, so make no mistake about my opinion).",

The food is good, everything is seasoned well and it tastes great. But the reason why I will not be returning is because there is JUST WAY TOO MUCH RICE and the fish is too thin. When i put the sushi in my mouth, 1/3 of the time I can taste the rice and fish evenly. But for the remaining 2/3 all I am chewing on is rice. It felt like I was downing a bowl of rice with fish flavoring. At my go-to AYCE sushi back home (sake2me-tustin), the size of the fish is 2x the size and rice is 1/2 that of Sushi Mon. I didn't expect it to be at that standard, because that's just how you do ayce sushi business (so the customers don't eat alot), but I thought the amount of rice:fish was ridiculous. I think I ate 1/2 of what I normally eat at an AYCE sushi because I was so full on rice. I glanced over at the next table and saw the rolls. I was glad I didn't order one.. lol I saw the great reviews on here and was excited for it, but I will not be returning... The waitress was really helpful and nice though.",

The only way to keep customer coming back is having good food quality and providing excellent experiences for them. We waited almost 10 mins to have anyone to noticed us and sit us.  Only time the server check on us is when he asked for our drinks. Asked for one iced tea and 1 water with lemons came out 2 water with lemons. Hey thats ok. People make mistake.  What upsets me the most is that if we seated at the bar, the reason to sit there is to be served directly from the chef.  We sat there exactly for 10 mins. And no one even acknowledge if us were there. NO HI NO HELLO NO WELCOME but a glare from a mexican chef with his unhappy face. We get it youre busy. But it takes 30 secs to remind customers that you know they are there, and will be right there to help. I wouldnt mind waiting so much.  I wanted to walk out so bad but the bf told me not to since we ordered side dishes already. 10 mins passed, still no help so i had to get the server attention if we could order and he took our orders.  Was going to do all you can eat but we felt so uncomfortable with the place were being so loud, no one seems to want to come check on us or even help us. Also the mexican guy kept glaring and rolling his eyes at us. So we switched it to ala carte and hurried to leave. The Experience werent great at all.",

    "text": "I gave this place a second chance and instantly regretted it. Walked in and waited five minutes to be sat at the sushi bar. There were only four other people in the restaurant!  I felt rushed the entire time. I got there at 12:45 and didn't get any sushi until 1:05. Then they told me last call was at 1:30.  The sushi chef was really rude. He held up his finger like I was an inconvenience when I asked for extra sauce. The sushi tasted ok but it was room temperature and almost warm. The best part of my meal was the fried stuff because I was able to eat it without feeling like I might get sick. I probably won't ever go back and the only reason they got two stars was because the servers were friendly and kept checking on me.",

Our server's name was George and from the beginning he seem to have a bit of an attitude he took our order and when he came to give us our plates he sort of tossed them to us, very unprofessional in my opinion we sat there eating for about 45 minutes before he refilled my husband's drink. We were very polite to him figured he was probably having a bad day the other server kept asking if we were ok and if we needed anything, unfortunately we didn't catch his name but left him a nice tip! The food was ok but because of the poor service we won't be returning to Sushi Mon and I'll be making sure to tell my coworkers of my bad experience there.  ***VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THE SERVICE***",

    "text": "2 thumbs up for this place!!!!!!!!!!!!  I saw my fd's pic when she went to vegas and i was told the sushi is GOOD (she's not a sushi lover). So I went there to try in my vegas trip (you know how hard you have to squeeze a quota out from the vegas buffets when you only stay there a few days) Then, I came out with a fat belly with high satisifation =)  1st, their price is reasonable!! only $27 for all-you-can eat with all FRESH sushi!!! You can really tell the freshness of sashimi WORTH every penny you pay!! Unlike other sushi buffet, they give you cheaper fish to maintain their cost, sushi mon has really good sushi (or even better than some Jap rest)!!! The sauce with some sashimi give you a better taste or refreshment! I love their citrus sauce!!!!  2nd, like all buffet, they'll remind you dun waste the food so you have to finish the rice. However, unlike other sushi buffet, their sushi rice is abit smaller than usual so that will give you more room to try other food.   3rd, even though they limit your dining time to 45mins (dinner hours), but that's enough!! Because the chefs made it quick and won't waste your time!!!   4th, all other hot dishes and appetizers are also delicious =)  So combine all these reasons, I went there twice on my 3days vegas trip. I'll definitely go there again when i go vegas =)",

    "text": "The hostess greeted me and I immediately thought his place was gonna have great service. My friend and I were sat very quickly at the sushi bar where we were greeted by our sushi chef who's name I don't remember, but he had these light green eyes you can't miss. He was awesome. The real trouble began after he informed us he was going on break and had a different guy take over. My friend asks for another roll, as the chef begins to make this, the server drops off our checks, right in the middle of our meal. Now I wouldn't be so irritated by that if we were almost finished, but it felt as if we were being rushed to finish. Also my friend was supposed to pay for this meal, somehow they gave us each separate checks, one AYCE and one ale cart. We told them we were BOTH doing AYCE and that it would be ONE check. I was a little annoyed but figured hey must've forgotten or something might have happened, so I brushed it off. The final straw however, was when the checks were dropped off the chef stopped making our rolls and looked at the bills. He then asked us why the checks had been dropped off, and if we were done. When we told him we weren't finished eating and to continue making the roll, he still continued to question us as to if we were finished, asking if we were gonna pay for the rolls he was making, saying \"I don't know what's going on.\" Only after we flagged down a server to change both bills to AYCE, did he continue to make our rolls. The first sushi chef we had was amazing, I'm really sad he had to go on break before we finished our meal. I'm sure this review would've been much better if the second chef hadn't been so rude. I won't be back, but for everyone else who goes and sits at the sushi bar, look for the Hispanic man with the green eyes, like I said he's AWESOME.",

    "text": "Used to come here EVERY TIME we went to vegas but it's come down a little in my opinion over the years as more people have found about it and frequent this place..  and since they don't take reservations the wait can be long, but usually worth it.   Its all you can eat for around $30, and that includes almost the whole menu.. appetizers, nigiri, rolls, dessert... thats what makes it so great its not just the sushi..   The kicker here is you get 1 order each of Uni, Toro and Ama Ebi, (provided they have it) i always give away my Uni and ama ebi to whoever im with.. not my thing..   there are 2 schools of sushi, THE NEW: rolls with fancy names and this inside and that on top; and THE OLDl: traditional nigiri, rice with fish on top.    if you like rolls this is definitely the place for you, many different types of rolls and you can ask for this, instead of that on top, they don't mind. (just leave a little more tip would ya?)    But if you are a nigiri person, heres the scoop.. Seems like you are only allowed so many servings of the good stuff per person (maybe 3 or 4) then you get the second rate stuff.. heres what i mean.. say you have 2 people.. you order 6 orders of  hamachi.. they come out nice, fresh, white belly part.. yum so good.. you want more?..\" 6 more please,,\" what you will get will not be even close to what you got the first time!  you might get the redder part of the fish or older and kinda dried out.  nothing like the first batch..  So heres what you gotta do.. order 8 or 10 orders the first time.. then move on to the next fish and never return to one that you've already ordered.. the best thing is to take people who order rolls, that way you get to have their portion of the \"fresh stuff\" while they dine on the rolls!!  bonus!!  (this rule dosent apply to rolls only nigiri, the rolls are always consistent i think)  There are specials too, they are unlimited (not part of the holy trinity of \"1 each\", uni, toro and ama ebi) there is also a supposed 1 hour time limit but its not strictly enforced (i just leave a bigger tip when i stay longer)  The next question, how does it stack up to Hikari?  The fresh stuff is much better than Hikari, the 2nd round stuff is not.  You can't order just sashimi (no rice) here only nigiri.  Pros: Freshest AYCE made to order sushi \"first round only\"  Cons: Uni, Ama ebi, and toro, 1 order only, 2nd round of nigiri is lacking (but understandable why they have to do it to get rid of product and not be cleaned out)   The fine print: you have to eat every thing that you order, or you have to pay for what you don't eat on top of your AYCE price..   Tips: Get there before opening to avoid long wait times.  check specials board on the back wall.. if they have Moi (pacific thread fin) get it!!  that is the bomb!!  if you order Ama Ebi, ask them to fry the heads for you.. its like eating a potato chip but shrimp flavored.. to get the most for you money.. avoid fillers and fried stuff in the beginning they fill you up faster save them for the final rounds.  avoid the tako poke, its not sliced tako its idakko (whole small tako), more rubbery and chewy, nothing like Hawaiian style tako poke.   Verdict: it teeters at 3 1/2 stars but if you follow the 10 step nigiri program i've laid out it could be a 4 star deal.",

This place has a full menu of sushi, sashimi, rolls, appetizers, and desserts that you can order endless amounts of if you choose to do their all you can eat option. Otherwise, the rolls will cost you $4 to $9 each. You can also do half orders of each roll so that you get more variety! Of course, you need to finish everything or be charged for the price of that plate. Not like anyone would waste good sushi, right?! I've never been so full in my life!   My favorite roll here was the deep fried philadelphia roll...mmm. I think I ate 3 full orders of various deep fried rolls that night! Another thing to try here is the fried shrimp heads! I didn't think I would like them, but they are delicious! Crispy and flavorful :) The desserts here are good too...I had the strawberry mochi and lychee sorbet.

    "text": "First off, it's hard to compare this place with other sushi joints local to Las Vegas because I am technically a Southern Cali girl. But Overall, I did have a good experience at this place.   Some friends and I were running some last minute errands in Las Vegas and we were way off the strip to take care of them. We were also quite hungry and just looking for some decent food we saw along the way. It was either Sushi or Greek. Everyone felt like Sushi so as soon as I saw a decent Sushi place, I said \"let's go to THAT one!\".   So we parked and headed inside. This place is TINY as heck. We luckily got seated fast but then a line started to form immediately after us. We definitely lucked out! I can only imagine how long you must have to wait to be seated when there are so few seats in this joint.  The service was not bad. But they did forget TWO of our orders. But the sushi was very good. We didn't opt for the All You Can Eat because there's no way I could eat $27 worth of sushi all by myself. I wasn't THAT hungry. I instead just ordered 2 rolls which came out to less than $15 total and I was a happy camper. The rolls were delicious and satisfying.   This place is busy and seems very popular among all. It must be a rare good sushi place in Vegas and so that's why everyone comes here. In my personal opinion, it's very hard to find good Asian food in Vegas. I have not been very impressed but this place is the first to semi impress me. I would actually come back again if I felt like driving off the strip for some sushi.",

They have very fresh sushi and a huge selection to choose from! I love sitting at the Sushi Bar and interacting with their Sushi Chefs.  The best part is, when you get all you can eat, there is a huge menu of not only sushi but other dishes you can have along with desert.  I love the mochi balls.   My fav is the strawberry.  For $25 a person, you can't go wrong! Sake Bombs!! Sake Bombs!!  :)  If you don't feel like all you can eat, they do have a very reasonably priced sushi menu!! YUMMMMY!",

    "text": "My wife and I love sushi.  We have been to several Sushi restaurants and sushi buffets in Las Vegas and Henderson.  Personally, I think Sushi Mon is the best - however, it is one of the most expensive.  The only knock on them is: a.  $27 price tag per head - ouch -- pretty pricey.  Most sushi buffets run around 20-24 bucks.  If you look around, you can get some under 20 too...  If they lower their weekly prices, they probably get more customers.  b.  1 hour time limit on dinner -- early in the meal, rather than enjoying the meal, I found myself \"clock\" watching.  But, actually, this was not bad, after 45 minutes, I was ready to be rolled out in a wheel barrow.  I was stuffed and felt like I was going to give birth. Being a guy, this probably would be my 15 minutes of fame on CNN. c.  You may have to wait 20-40 minutes.  By the way, problem with waiting is that there is NO waiting area.  The street is it.    We have been here 3 times already.  Unfortunately, they do not take reservations.. Be ready to wait in line.  The first time we were here, we had to wait 45 minutes (ended up shopping at Smith's grocery store to past the time).  Secondly, I would recommend asking to be seated at the BAR.  When they seat you at the table, they give you this menu and you have to hail down a waiter.  I rather sit at the bar and watched the \"sushi guys\" make the sushi.  Also, you get quicker service instead of waving down a waiter.  You can ask the sushi guy directly to make you the roll.  As for the sushi, it was fresh!  We love the cooked eel, salmon, and yellowtail.  yum... definitely, we will be back!",

I often order nigiris (salmon belly, yellowtail belly, etc) and boy, they are just so buttery and creamy in my tummy! They are often given to you as fast as they can because this place can get quite busy.  Food taste: 4 of 5 Ambiance: 4 of 5 Staff Attitude: 4.5 of 5  The only thing I really hate about Sushi Mon is that it is so cramped, which means longer wait for you and your party of however many to get seated. Often, party of 2 gets seated quite fast, but anything over 4 just gets ridiculous from waiting 40 mins to 1 hour. So, be prepared to wait and mingle around Smith's, Dollar Tree, or Toyko Discount before you get seated.",

The service is pretty good, depending on how busy it is. The wait could get long when sitting at a table, so I would recommend sitting at the sushi bar for quicker service. The price for AYCE (all you can eat) sushi is reasonable, as long as I get my mochi dessert at the end I'm a happy camper. Definitely a fan!",

Every time my family members visit Vegas, that have to get a fix of Sushi Mon.    Why is it that they crave this particular restaurant?    *their awesome and fresh quality? *their quick service and friendly staff?  *their myriad selection of delicious sushi combination and original master pieces?  *great price? *not only do you get to choose from a extended selection of delicious sushi, you also have the option of ordering appetizers including gyoza, seasame chicken, miso soup, shrimp and vegetable tempura, hamachi kama...do I need to say more?    What I love about this place also is that the sushi to rice ratio is just right!  (meaning they are not cheap and do not overload their sushi rolls with rice) haha.    One of my pet-peeves regarding sushi is the rice quality and boy does Sushi Mon meet my standards.    My opinion, check this place out!    Don't forget to save room for dessert! =)",

I really liked the waiting system where they text you and let you know how long your wait is and when your table is ready that way you can go hang out at starbucks nextdoor or run some errands. The last time I was there with the husband, there was no more waitlist texting system and we waited 3 hours for a party of 2 when the hostess originally said only 45 minutes and they would call us when our table was ready. Came back after 2 hours as we waited in the car because it was so cold and windy outside and the outdoor heaters were broken or turned off. I thought they had the wrong number to contact me, but nope. I told the hostess that they weren't on, she just said, \"oh, ok.\" anyways, after a 2 hr wait in the car in the cold, the hostess told us it would be only another 45 minutes. Waited another hour and finally left and went to Sushi Koma. It has been 3 weeks and I am still waiting for a phone call to tell us our table is ready at Sushi Mon.   I had also gone to Goyemon (a sushi mon related joint) about a week ago and they still had the texting waitlist system which worked perfectly. Not sure what is happening at sushi mon on maryland.",

A plus side is that their lunch specials are great sized portions for not so great sized prices, but you compromise with the quality. Sashimi doesn't appear to be fresh. Potato salad tastes like nothing... is it supposed to be a palate cleanser? Tempura tastes fine, but the onion is impossible to eat and the sauce is extremely salty, overpowering the tempura.

    "text": "Hrm... Have to update my review as I'm not sure how I feel about this place anymore...   Between  November 2015 and now (January 2016) my boyfriend and I have gotten AYCE here about 5 times. Our last two times were not as great as the first three, so we will probably be finding a new sushi place ):   Our first bad experience - We came with our friends in the middle of the day and sat at a table instead of the sushi bar like we usually do. The service was slower, some of the rolls tasted a little different than usual, however, overall, still a good experience! Until they brought the check out before they even brought out our friends ice creams. We reminded them that we only received half of the desserts we ordered, so they cashed us out and then brought the ice cream. OK, no harm, no foul. My boyfriend and I had finished our ice cream and our friends were still finishing theirs and drinking their hot green tea. However, since we had payed at this point, they asked us to leave so they could \"get the table ready for the next guest\" (!!) I was a little disappointed by this as we already felt rushed when they brought the check out before the dessert. Not to mention there was not a long wait at this point (only one family who had just walked in, and clearly we were about to be finished and leave, just finishing up drinks), and we would have gladly moved to the bar while our friends finished their teas and then left. The whole situation just felt rude and I was disappointed that we had raved about this place to our friends, asked them to come here with us, only for us to get kicked out at the end of our meal! It was pretty rude and we wouldn't have tipped so well if we knew they were going to treat us like that...  While that left a pretty bad taste in my mouth, we decided it was probably just a fluke on the hosts part and wanted to give this place another try, especially since we have never had bad service before! So we came around noon and went to the bar like usual, the place was already pretty full this time, even though they just opened. The usual sushi chef we have (I forget his name, but he is hispanic, very friendly man and super good at his job!) was not here this day. The chef we got was super slow and the rolls didn't taste the same as usual (fish wasn't as fresh maybe? or chef used different ingredients? I'm not sure). He also wasn't very personable, whereas the other chef was always saying hello, asking how you liked the roll, and cracking jokes! It wasn't all on the sushi chef, though, because our edamame came out from the kitchen burnt! The server, nonetheless, plopped it down in front of us. Even the nigiri tasted different, and sub-par, which is usually so fresh and my favorite thing here!  I will probably give this place one last try, however I don't have high hopes after my last two experiences here. Looks like we will just have to find a new sushi spot. /:  TL;DR - Used to love this place, last two experiences have not been as great. Check came before dessert so we were rushed through it, then asked to leave to 'clear the table for the next guest' even though our friends were still finishing up. Gave it one more shot and sushi wasn't fresh, edamame came out burnt, and food was just all-around sub-par.",

This corner shop is more on the \"suburban\" outskirts of Las Vegas and is in a shopping plaza.  In short, I got a teriyaki lunch special for 6 bucks and it was quite filling with its large bento box full of servings of chicken, rice, tempura, salmon sashimi, gyoza, and the additional (and obligatory) bowls of salad and miso soup. I guess the only minor gripes I had were that the soup was lukewarm, the salad was drenched in dressing, and the salmon was dry. But for the amount of food I got for the money, there's not much else bad to say.",

It took a while to get our food and then a long wait for our check. I would definitely go back just not on Fridays or Saturdays.",

    "text": "Definitely a go to place when you're in Vegas and want AYCE Sushi.    Let me start off with the place.  It's a pretty small location and with the amount of interest, this place gets packed and wait times can range from 10 min to 90 min+.  On our last trip there, we had a party of six and what disturbed us the most was that seating was not on a first come first served basis for larger groups.  You would expect the staff to hold tables that are next to each other and almost nearly closing out to fit a larger group but that was not the case.  Groups of four was being seated before us and we had to wait for a larger table that would normally fit six.  We had to wait almost 90+ minutes before we got a table.  My recommendation is to get there before they open which I believe is 11am or after 2pm when it starts to die down.    The food there is awesome!  Nothing to complain about.  Try anything that catches your eye.  My top picks are the white tuna, garlic ahi, ama ebi, unagi, masago w/ qual eggs, calamari, shrimp tempura, etc.    It looks like they opened another location so we'll most likely try that place out when we're back in town.",

Food was very good (not excellent, but very fresh), and the garlic edamame was off the chain! Highly recommend this place, food and service excellent, atmosphere busy but worth the wait.",

I really enjoyed the fact that I could order a half order of an item that I wasn't too sure about. This made it easier to order certain things that I wasn't too sure about. But all turned out delicious and the fish is always fresh.   The only negatives is the building itself is quite small and the wait times can be horrible. They need a larger building.",

    "text": "MMmmmmMMMMmmm!!    First time here. From what i heard from others, I think they raised the price up a bit. Is it because it's NYE weekend? I'm not sure. From $26 to $28...still a bargain for AYCE sushi. You can also opt to do a la carte. But really, who wants to do that?   It's a small intimate space with a sushi bar. We sat at the sushi bar to get to know the sushi chefs and watch them make the sushi and rolls. Basically, you get to order from the entire menu...AYCE. So many to choose from. My mom who doesn't eat raw fish went for the special rolls and cooked items...she was in heaven.   For those of us who are fans of sushi and LOVE fresh fish...all I can say is YOWZAH and MORE please! Each AYCE patron gets one order of Toro and Uni. Unfortunately, the night we came, there was no Uni left. But the Toro was delicious. I have never had Toro before so I was surprised that it resembled fresh meat. Is that fish? Wow! So fresh and so good.  My fave is salmon so I ordered it in bulk. It was so fresh, no smell and no sign of fishiness at all. I am so against not so fresh fish...that the freshness of the fish we were served here competes with more expensive a la carte sushi locations I have been to in the past. My experience here was amazing.   I had lots and lots of special rolls, hand rolls, nigiri sushi, shrimp tempura, mussels, dynamite etc, etc, etc that I was bursting at the seams. I barely could breathe when walking out of there.   We all had a wonderful time and this was the first time I have ever been to an AYCE sushi where I can say that the fish is fresh and tasty. Great experience for sure and even the chefs and the servers were friendly, quick to serve and the sushi chefs kept asking us constantly what else we wanted.  I will for sure come back here again with my appetite in tow. Until we meet again....",

The rolls are tasty and I love that you can get 1/2 orders so you can try many different dishes and not have to waste food.  I used to always order rolls until I discovered that their nigiri is surprisingly fresh. My usual order consists of uni, sweet shrimp, shrimp head (tastes like shrimp chips and its not on the menu), yellow tail collar, 6 x super white tuna (I'm salivating just thinking about this buttery goodness), 5 x albacore (the Cajon albacore is also delicious), 4 x scallops ( giant Japanese scallops, not the dinky ones mixed in mayo), tempura ice cream, and lychee sherbert (the mochi is good too if you' re a mochi fan).  I eat like I'm preparing to hibernate for the winter. It's cheap and soooooooooooooo good. Mmm.",

    "text": "Rules for ALL YOU CAN EAT: never ever drink soup or eat rice!  THESE ARE FILLERS...FILLERS!! AND ONLY WASTE YOUR STOMACH SPACE!  COME TO BUFFETS HYDRATED so you don't have to drink much water either!  I know.. nutrition professional and I'm telling you this..hahaha  Story time: The places opens at 11:45 AM and because a group takes forever to get ready, instead of individuals, we left at 12 PM and got there about 12:15 PM.  BIG MISTAKE!  The rush had already gone through. NOO!  As a result, we had a 40-minute wait.  After meeting with mama-san at Tokyo Discount, we came back in dismay as we had to wait another 30-40 min. Waiting in the sun,..dear god it's winter and I am sweating?  WE'RE STARVVING!  On our death beds, hypoglycemia status..and all I could think about are my sugar levels.  Where is an emergency glucose pill when you need it? After all was done, said, and eaten..i left with gochi o sama deshita!  hontoni, sugoku oishiikatta desu!  The Japanese owner was impressed that I could speak Japanese!    Synopsis: One word, white tuna sushi!  PURE HEAVEN!  It's like buttaahhhhhhhh without the clogging-feeling aftermath.  I literally came in my pants, no joke.  I came here with all the Vegas crew i met through my BFF.  In total, 8 of us.  The horror beginning of it all, was that we waited more than an hour, and the way they made us wait was horrific, but even with that said, the $28 bucks we spent (18% tip including), was more than worth it.  Hence, 5 stars!  I'm certain their revenue has hit the negative due to our cow-like stomachs.  Would I come here?  HELL YES!!!  Mmm.I can't wait to come back and have Sushi Mon on the side as a bonus feature!  Employees:  If you can speak Japanese, they will be impressed, especially if you don't look like your Japanese (usually I am told I look Japanese, but being with all Filipinos...it didn't seem so). The lady smiled at me and the cute guy I was with, Keifer, was also impressed. Sumimasen, Atarashi pureto onegaishimasu!  Although the guy who served us didn't have a happy smile on his face.  I totally disregarded that because I was beyond starvation to care.  More to that, our table was demanding because we were ordering like everything on the menu times 5!  Hahaha..  Although in the end, the guy was rude.  After I got my sugar levels back to normal, service seemed to matter more.  He said, \"because there are a lot of people waiting, we need to as you to leave\" even though our EXTRA round of desserts haven't made it to our table.  RUDE!  Too bad, I put the tip in before he said it.  Otherwise, it would have certainly been 10!!!  not to mention...WE WERE WAITING FOR HEIFERS BEFORE THIS TO FINISH EATING!  And their BMIs were about 35...and there were FOUR of them.  RUDE!  Parking: Very easy!  I love Vegas for this.  It's not like Hawai'i, where you have to hunt for excruciating amount of time to visit your favorite restaurant.  Although, compared to how many people were there, to the amount of parking, it seemed unjustified and misleading.  Lots of parking, not enough space in the restaurant.  Womp, womp!  Cost: For all you can eat, $28 including 18% tip, amazing.  I'm positive we ate the restaurant in the negatives.  I can safely say, each of us ate about $100 worth of food  Food: Where do I even begin!  I didn't care what the names were, they all went into my tummy!  1, 2, 3...Houdini tricks!  All gone in one fell swoop!  Although, the most eye-back rolling, pants creaming goodness was the white tuna.  OMG  Just thinking about it makes me drool with delight.  I honestly hope the next guy I date tastes this good!  My second favorite were the clams soaking in a cheese sauce?  UGH!  OMG!  It was a burst of smooth creamy lovely!  Then of course you have to have the other foods that cause dyslipidemia such as deep-fried oysters? and Shrimp Tempura!  10 each, GONNNNEE!  And then before I pass out from all the food, \"Um...may I have two vanilla mochi ice creams please?\"    Drinks: Water with lemon!  Cheap flavored water.  Plus you get vitamin C and antioxidants.  Can you please make my lemon bigger?  Rating-disclosure: Although the wait was absurd, and the service not glamorous, i still gave this place 5 stars because the food honestly made up for it.  It really did!  And probably because I was with good company.  If to me, service mattered more than the food, I would definitely have given this place 4 stars.  The only thing holding me back is the unfortunate fact that Hawai'i is deprived of awesome all-you-can-eat sushi due to import costs.",

Sushi Mon was recommended to me by friends but my first time eating the food was takeout and therefore not the all-you-can-eat everyone talks about.  Maybe I'm a little spoiled but the appearance of my sushi lacked uniformity. You could see what pieces were the end of the rolls because they were short on stuffing/ fish. The rolls fell apart in my chopsticks and in my fingers. This was definitely finger-eating sushi but for the wrong reasons.  Quality was good though. I did enjoy the flavor of the sushi rice and the fish was fresh. I'll go back again because it's my local joint.  I must add though, the dining room is small and don't be a fool like one guy I saw who came in thinking he could get a table for 10 without a reservation. \"Sir, it will be an hour and a half wait.\"  \"What?! Why's that? This is a special occasion for us!\" He retorted scanning a packed room with not one empty table.  \"Well sir, all of these people here are ahead of you and waiting for a table,\" said the hostess gesturing to alllllllll the people waiting inside and outside....",

The wait between orders of sushi is a little long but it's worth it and understandable when the place is busy.  The sushi rolls aren't just rice with minimalist fill. It's appropriate to what you order.  All you can eat sushi is incomplete without edemame, wasabi, and soy sauce on the side.  You have to have miso soup to wrap it all up toward the end of your sushi session.  It's a nice cozy joint and the staff are friendly.

I still love the ability to order the whole menu at the AYCE dinner.  Sushi plus chicken teriyaki, shrimp tempura, miso soup and more.  Had the Chubby role late and wished I had ordered it earlier.  Kids discovered the dessert is also AYCE.  The one hour limit is really a one session of eating limit.  We were there about 90 minutes but were consistently eating, so no problem.  Don't worry if you order something you don't like.  No archaic leftover food rules.  Gotta check it out!",

    "text": "I would give this place 5 stars.....ONLY if they were a little bit easy on the hawk style watch over you when you eat \"all you can eat\" menu with people who are eating a la carte.  They literally watch you like a hawk and no one likes to be watched like that when they're eating.  I have witnessed a really bad scene once where a man stated he was too embarrassed to finish his meal because of they way they were watching him and accussing him of sharing his all you can eat menu with his family.  It was ridiculous on both Sushi Mon's part and the mans part.    But all in all, all you can eat sushi..is bomb.  Their sushi tastes fresh and they have an awesome side menu to order things like seaweed salad, miso soup, tempura shrimp, yellowtail collar, baked mussels, beef teriyaki, and shumai which is all also all you can eat.  This is the place to go when you are hungry and its open pretty late.  Last call is at 1:30am.  Price is about $27 per person.  To me...good deal because I can eat way more sushi over that price.    Plus you have all you can eat dessert ;) green tea ice cream, mochi balls, red bean ice cream.....man.  Whats not to love?  They even have those stamp cards for frequent customers.  Free 11th all you can eat meal.  HOLLA!",

Yeah, it's open til 2 am, yeah it's all-you-can-eat, but I'd rather eat at Yama earlier or spend like $5 more at Osaka (which is also open til 2 am and has a late night discount menu, which includes philly rolls and japanese lasagna).  The rolls are DECENT. Nothing spectacular. They don't bond the seaweed/rice properly. Or perhaps the rice isn't cooked right. But the rolls look like crap and fall apart easily.  Japanese lasagna is ONLY tolerable at Osaka. Anytime I see it on a menu somewhere else I have to try it. And it disappoints. Always.  This place is too small. Good luck trying to get a party of 4+ in here. The service is sub-par. It's usually loud as hell and packed - inside and out. I'm not waiting. I don't want to drive to eat somewhere and find out it's too busy to serve me. So I just don't go here - period.  I'm trying to sample most of the good sushi places in Vegas, and when I find an affordable place that serves good standard AND special rolls, I return frequently, especially when service isn't lacking. AND I tell everyone I know about it. Sushi Mon just isn't worthy. Kekkou desu!",

After reading all the great reviews on Yelp, we were excited to try Sushi Mon and it did not disappoint!  We didn't even check in to our hotel, but went directly to Sushi Mon for dinner.  Nothing that says \"Welcom to Las Vegas\" better than a good AYCE sushi buffet, you know.  They had a wide variety of cooked and uncooked rolls.  We ordered mostly nigiri rolls and they were fresh and tasty!  You definitely need to ask the chef what their daily fresh fish specials were because they were awesome!  Although there is an hour limit, we went over an hour and they did not make any comments.  Maybe it's because we went on a Thursday night and it wasn't that busy?  I also liked how the dessert is included in the AYCE.  It seems like a better deal to eat dinner there because they give you an hour limit, whereas it's a 45 minute limit and a couple of bucks cheaper for lunch.  We will be back!",

Wish it was closer to home and the location was larger because at peak times this place is packed! (Go during off peak times for less of a wait time.) On our most recent visit a couple days ago we both did the sushi meals and it was yummy. The fish pieces were huge! And delicious! I don't have anything bad to say about the food except for Yum. Mind you I am picky since I'm from Hawaii and miss having access to my sushi or poke. What I would say is don't be too excited about the ahi or tako poke. Those are just okay. Another high point is for gyoza or shumai you are able to get them steamed and not fried. A great option for a healthier audience. If you like spicy, the spicy tuna is spicy and the 911 roll is HOT! If you like super, super spicy don't get it! The regular spicy tuna is yum and perfectly hot. The salad that comes with the meals is under par. I've had better. But all in all it's a good eat and buy.",

The place was smaller than I had envisioned and I was wondering how the small two top we were seated at was gonna hold the smorgasbord of food we were about to  order! The service was very attentive and my friend commented this was the best waiter she's had in all the times she's been here. I was happy to see they had my two favorite items on the Ayce menu. They are hamachi kama and baked mussels! Yummy! Only downside is you are limited to one order of the hamachi kama. Ordered a bunch of nigiri and several more hot apps. Loved the unagi and super white tuna. Both fried and steamed gyoza were delish as the skin was nice and thin just the way I like it! Finished off with Mochi ice cream and lychee sorbet. Very refreshing! I was nervous about the one hour time limit as I am a pretty slow eater. :) they did not enforce the one hour limit. We were there about an hour and a half and no one seemed to be rushing us. Good food. Good service. Great company. I was a happy girl. Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu!",

From the moment I got in there I felt like I was being rushed. First off there is a 45 minute time limit on the dinner all you can eat. Then if you do not know exactly what you want to order when you are asked the chef will not wait for you to decide or help you decide, they will just skip you. Near the end of are dinner are chef up and disappeared for 20 minutes and no one asked if we needed anything. If I am paying for a timed dinner I find this unacceptable. Then at the end of the meal we got a punch card where if you get 10 all you can eats you get one for free. I like this, but again they put a time limit on the punch card!  So if you are in a rush and want to eat sushi then this is a decent place to go, but if you want to relax and take your time, find a different sushi place.",

    "text": "Pretty decent all-you-can-eat sushi bar, which is harder to find in Las Vegas these days.  My favorite used to be Hamada, but they stopped doing it a year or so ago.  They have some rules, which seem fair.  They state that you must eat everything (including rice) in order to avoid getting charged, but they didn't seem to enforce that rule, grabbing plates away before we had a chance to eat every crumb.  I think as long as you don't abuse the all-you-can-eat, they are totally cool about it.  The place is nothing special, located in a shopping strip mall.  However, they are open late, which is a real plus in my book.  We went late, and there were quite a few people coming and going.  The hamachi and maguro nigiri were actually very good.  The miso soup was not (too watery and not much tofu).  The sunomono salad was also very tasty and fresh.  The rolls are big, so order conservatively until you see what I am talking about.  The 9-1-1 roll was scorching HOT!  We loved it, but unless you want to sweat, don't order it.  The menu warns you in case you don't listen to me.  Keep in mind the rule if you don't eat everything.  Overall, I give it a thumbs up.  I would go back if I was looking a late night sushi spot for sure.  The total bill for 3 people was $95.78 and that included 3 all-you-can-eat orders and 1 large Sapporo.  Tip was extra.",

    "text": "This place was so crowded! We went on a tuesday night and it was absolutely packed, not just at the bar but at all the tables as well. My wife and I decided to give this place a try since it is just down the street of our new apartment and we were hoping it would make for a good alternative to our usual sushi place, Yama. Afterwards we decided it was an OK place, but the extra drive to Yama was worth it for the better quality food.   Ok, so the good parts first I think... first, all you can drink soda was a plus, most sushi places will just give you a can of soda but this place gave nice big glasses. Servers were also very quick on the refills, and since I can down a glass of soda or water very quickly during a meal I kept out waiters busy, lol.  We both got the AYCE at the sushi bar and once we got the attention of our sushi chef started ordering. Most of the food was OK, the baked green mussels were about average while the garlic albacore was delicious. My wife absolutely loved their special \"Sushi Bon\" dish, one of their new specials. For dessert my wife and I also recommend the lychee sorbet, very tasty. Sadly this just about ends the positive portion of this review.  Ok, now for the problems. Other than the refills, service was slow as hell here. It took the chef about 20 minutes per item, longer if it was baked. At first I thought it was just because of the crowd, but even once it started emptying in the restaurant it remained painfully slow. This is despite the large number of sushi chefs on duty at the time as well!   As for the majority of the sushi itself it was nothing all the great. We tried a number of different items and found most of them to be a bit bland. Also, they all seemed to be variations of the same thing (and not a good thing at that). Presentation was a bit lacking as well, nearly every dish we had looked rushed and fell apart while we were trying to eat it. They had an item which was a variation of a dynamite roll that we ordered, it looked like they had skimped on the toppings, then when we went to eat it the thing turned to mush before we could take a bite. Most of the food was like this, either it fell apart or didn't seem to be cooked right or something just wasn't right. Really a let down for the evening.   All in all it was an OK experience, the plain sushi was yummy and I enjoyed a small number of the rolls, but the bulk of it was just not what I would consider quality sushi. How it got this busy and such a good rating is a mystery to me. But they do have a huge selection and if you are willing to brave some of the more interesting rolls then give it at least one try, you might find it is more to your tastes than my own.",

Fish to rice ratio is well done. If you're feeling adventurous, order deep fried shrimp heads (not on the menu).",

Once seated at SushiMon, the waitress was very patient with us & personable while we took a gander at the menu. She recommended items based on what we liked. All of the rolls came out soon after we placed our orders. Everything was good and tasted fresh, but hardly stuck out to me from their competitors. The notable rolls: Lemon Roll, Chubby, Hurricane, & Sexy Girl. I was starved from the long ass wait that I did not take a single food pic. I also liked the octopus seaweed salad. They have lychee sorbet as a dessert item, with lychee chunks! Reminded me of home (Hawaii). Fyi Goyemon on Decatur is its sister property & has the same exact menu.",

    "text": "Oh. my. balls.  I really want to end my review with just that, but I can't. Because some omnipotent authoritative figure will strike me down and put me 6 feet underground. Because Sushi Mon deserves a damn good review. Because this place is FAWKING. AMAZING.  I've been to Oyshi (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/oyshi-sushi-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/oyshi-sushi...</a>) a few months back, and now i've got my chance to feast with a few good friends at Sushi Mon. These two restaurants alone dominate the AYCE sushi game in Vegas. And they are both dericious. But a good friend said \"Oyshi does Rolls really well. Sushi Mon does sushi really well. so it all comes down to what you like.\"   I couldn't have said it better myself. Anyone who's been a long time fan of AYCE sushi knows that these type of places sacrifice quality for quantity. C'mon pal, it's all you can eat sushi. In a perfect world... amirite?  THE SKINNY:  ironically, if you come to Sushi Mon, you won't be leaving very skinny. There are REALLY BAD all-you-can-eat sushi places, and there are REALLY GOOD all-you-can-eat sushi places. There is very few in-betweens, and really, why would you want to settle for less? you're better than that. LET'S HAVE SOME SELF RESPECT! Sushi Mon is one of those REALLY GOOD ayce places. I know most of my ayce sushi reviews have been 4 to 5 stars...but have you ever wondered why? because I don't settle, and neither should you! But after going to sushi mon, i dont know man. It's really raising the bar. (Although nothing beats Kami. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/kami-tustin\">yelp.com/biz/kami-tustin</a> R.I.P Kami.)  The Food: Okay so for your sake and mine, I will keep this brief. Fish quality, yeah it's fresh, real fresh (makes you wonder how they do it...i mean, they are in the dessert afterall...) They have specials that i assume changes daily, and they are amazing. Yellowtail belly? keep em' coming! Conch? hell yes.  Sushi mon have some sushi items that are not on any list i've ever seen.   although be warned: they put a small, small bit of wasabi to hold the fish to the rice. If you hate that...well...um... THEY HAVE DESSERT! :D It's part of the all you can eat menu. now that's amazing. I think that's what all my girlfriend ate...  her: \"baby can you order me red bean ice cream?\"  her: \"baby can you order me another green tea ice cream? oh! with strawberry mochi ice cream please!\"  Me: \"excuse me miss, can i get another strawberry mochi ice cream please? and an order of tempura ice cream for myself-\" her: \"oh i want one of those too!\"  me: \"...make that two.\" Story of my life...by the way, lychee sorbet, talk about a home run. and i don't even play baseball.   They have an extensive appetizer menu, that's all on the list for all you can eat, which really sets them apart from a lot of places. Salmon Collar? bring me like 20 please.  To really go the extra mile (which is also ironic because we drove 200+ miles to get to vegas...I think i'm using irony wrong) , they have this topping menu that you can order from to accompany any of your orders. Quail egg, masago, orgasm sauce...dont ask. I didnt.  (Just like my underwear, this section wasn't really brief, now was it?)  *notice i didn't really talk about the rolls. :x my buddies went at that, i stuck to the nigiri. beause i'm a hipster. whateeeever*  The Service: I'm more use to the aptly named \"southern california\" version of all you can eat sushi, which refers to a checklist that you can give to the waitress. Why Sushi Mon or Oyshi never adapted to this is beyond me. It makes life so much easier! But in both Sushi Mon and Oyshi, their waiters and waitresses will go up to you and write down what you're ordering. Needless to say, that poor lady was standing at our table for a good 10 minutes taking our orders.   You come here. Come here now. Oh what? you can't decide between a vegas-style buffet, Oyshi, or Sushi Mon?   FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS.",

The price was also decent and the wait staff was very friendly. The drive was definitely worth it and I ate so much that I skipped dinner. I wish they had Sushi-Mon in LA!!",

My daughter had been here last month with her college friends & warned me of their negative experience. We were neither greeted nor served at our table for 10 minutes. I had to ask for water & menus. They came late with a longer wait for the orders to be taken. The soup & salad came, but we had to endure more than 20 minutes for the main order. My daughter's order came & was finished but mine didn't. The waitress walked pass & never bothered to check on us. I went to the counter & asked the male staff if I should be served or I should leave. He was not apologetic at all. He went to the kitchen & I was served a plate of cold food that was obviously left too long forgotten in the kitchen.",

Didn't feel like paying big bucks for overrated pricey sushi joints on the strip, so we decided to hit this place up as a recommendation from a friend.  I was blown away by how many items they had on their AYCE menu. Suppppper thrilled to order every single item possible to try.  Their nigiri was superb because the fish was really fresh and sweet. The best has to be the white tuna! The sweet shrimp and uni definitely had to be my favorite, and it sucked that you can only order it once.  All their rolls were very unique and each one satisfied my tastebuds. The best part was that they allowed half orders on the rolls, so you can try more!  The icing on the cake was the selection of ice cream at the end. From tempura, to mochi, to red bean... It was heaven  Can't wait to come back to Vegas in 2 weeks and hit up this spot again. BEST AYCE sushi I've ever had, and that's coming a lot from someone who's had multiple hot spots in socal.   THUMBS WAY UP",

They include all their side dishes for their AYCE price, and they have great hot tea to accompany any meal.

There was a line when we got there and the wait was about 40 minutes.  We weren't in a rush so we killed time by checking out the surrounding stores.    When we finally got our seats, we immediately told the waitress we wanted the AYCE sushi (all of us love sushi).  It was about $26 at the time.  The one thing that we didn't know going in was that you only have 1 hour for AYCE.  We ending up coming a second time and ordered a lot of plates at the beginning.  When we had eaten about half of the plates, we would order again.  That way, we could eat more and not get full as fast from waiting if you order one plate at a time.  I tried most of their specialty rolls (dragon, caterpillar, tiger, volcano, athena, etc.).  All delicious.  If they have it in stock, you can order sweet shrimp and salmon collar too.  One order per person though, even if you are doing AYCE.  The tempura ice cream was a nice dish to finish off the meal.  We all got our money's worth for sure (and then some).  If you're ever in Las Vegas and have a craving for sushi, definitely consider coming here.  There's another place called 808 Sushi that's similar to Sushi Mon, but I don't think there's a time limit.  I'll have to check it out the next time I visit.",

Huh. AND it's ALL YOU CAN EAT! EAT ALL THE THINGS!  The cuts are pretty huge.. just the right amount and not with a ton of wasabi like you normally get at other all you can eat sushi restaurants.  My friends and I kept ordering a bazillion orders of yellowtail because it is our favorite! It's about $25 total for as many as you want!! Ahhh!! The waiters were awesome and very quick.  They started us out on one order on a normal plate, then started bringing our orders on huge plates with 8 orders on them because the yellowtail disappeared into our bellies. Friends: \"Wow, our orders are getting bigger.\" Me: \"Wow, the fish cuts are getting bigger and bigger. I think they want us out.\"  This place is also open LATE! We arrived in Vegas at midnight and my friend who lives around the area took us here at around 1 am and we ate for an hour til we were full! Wish there was one in Torrance!

I'm literally down the street. With the exception of one incredibly gross, gut-wenching moment a few years back where me and some co-workers found a roach scrambling on our table as our waitress handed our bill, its been smooth sailing.. I'm glad because its said if you find just one of those mofos then its fairly certain theres an infestation. In this case I'm gonna chalk it up to a momentary lapse in unsanitary food practices and thankfully theres been no sight of those suckas ever since.   It still gets busy during their peak times, prices are on par with the rest of them AYCE but I still fu*k with this place and the rest of the spots belonging to the Mon group.",

We usually try to make a stop here every time we're in town but this time the service was extremely sub par.  We were first seated by \"A\" who is one of the most INCOMPETENT servers/and hostesses that I have ever met or seen in my life. Just horrible mannerisms and cannot deal with anything on her own.  Anyway, she doesn't understand the concept of customer service. Why do I say that? Well we came in and she just pushed us aside even though she had a table open.  After we waited for a while, she introduced herself. We ordered. But time was ticking and we didn't get what we wanted. AT ALL.  She was just a horrible server all around who didn't own up to her incapabilities.  Our lunch lasted longer than usual because of her.  Besides\"A\"-the horrible server, we were also told we couldn't get anything unless we paid for dinner price. (it was lunch time though...) But apparently they changed the rules and now you can't order your 1order of Uni unless you pay for dinner price even during lunch hours. And also you can't order Mango Mochi unless you pay for dinner price, although you can order Strawberry Mochi (Totally don't understand that rationale, but whatever)..  OVERALL : Food was so-so, but service & rule-changes this time was BAD.",

One person in our party has never eaten sushi like the other 2 of us, so we practically shoved all sorts of nigiri and specials down his throat.  The Salmon Belly special was amazing! If you thought regular salmon filet was soft, this buttery goodness just melts away your heart. We had probably 4 rounds of this during our meal.  The Baked Mussels were also great.   We mostly ate nigiri and appetizers. The rolls looked good, but as we were hosting our friend, we didn't want to get stuck with something he wouldn't help us eat.  We finished off with Tempura Ice Cream, which didn't have the texture as we hoped, but it was still a nice way to finish off the meal. By the time were finished, the restaurant had a waitlist and you can see people just eyeing your table.  As for satisfying our stomachs... let's just say we opted to walk off our food and head back to South Point on foot... it was 50 minutes of walking...",

The quality of the fish is very fresh and they have an extensive menu for AYCE. My favorite items on the menu are the Uni, sweet shrimp and yellow tail collar! Too bad they limit each person to only one per order. Some must have nigiri are the super white tuna, hamachi & ikura with a quail egg. Baked items that I love are the green mussels and lasagna roll. Don't forget green tea & lychee ice cream & strawberry mochi for dessert. The service is excellent and pretty fast here, it's what keeps me coming back!",

The food is awesome and there are a wide range of choices. Also, take a look at the specials (some are 1 p/p). Some of my usual nigiri favs are: fresh salmon, seared ahi, yum yum scallop, snow crab meat, salmon belly (special)(<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7ibuDLfx8gEhESAufYIySw?select=4gmQ0WpBwpKHKyaLykWCYA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7ibu...</a>), negitoro (special), striped jack (special), hamachi, & cajun salmon (special). I love that the fish is wrapped all the way around the little bit of rice. Hot items I like are: dynamite, shrimp tempura, hamachi kama (special) & the mussels. For dessert, get as much in your tummy as possible, it's all good! From tempura ice cream (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7ibuDLfx8gEhESAufYIySw?select=aqikDFl8ktJdqzKo1gPWaw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7ibu...</a>) to mochi cream, you cannot go wrong.

The service we had at both Sushi Mon locations was awesome, but I must give props to the Maryland Pkway location because they took our # and called us when our table was ready so we could shop around the area for a little bit. We sat at the sushi bar & Chef Mike was very attentive and helpful. There's a ton of parking and the one-person-bathroom is very clean.  All in all, Sushi Mon is affordable, fun, delicious, and a winner. Banzai!",

I really like the cucumber salads here.  There's just one problem, it's so popular at this location, and the building is so small that there is a long wait line many of the times which can be a burden.  Sometimes the wait isn't worth it, but I do think this is the best all-you-can eat sushi place around this area.",

Okay so BF got mad at me for giving sushi mon a 4 stars..so we compromised 4.5 stars  ~ The Order ~ Sashimi Dinner - $13.95 for 12 pieces w/ soup & salad * usually get this as I love sashimi * good thick fresh yummy cuts; they don't skimp * if you're lucky you get a 2 extra spindles of crab =)  All in all - BF & I always go here cuz he can get half rolls & I get my fill of sashimi  P.S. BF would like to point out that they are really big rolls.. and for the price..and open so late ... P.P.S BF however will not sit at the sushi bar cuz he felt like the chefs weren't really nice to him bcuz he ordered the more conservative/americanized /cooked rolls vs. the out there rolls",

    "text": "Stopped in mostly because it was near where I was staying for work. Couldn't get in the door on first try, went back a few days later and sat at the bar. Since it was so crowded we expected it to be pretty good, sadly not so much. The sushi chef talked us into the all u can eat deal, cheap enough at $27 a head. I'm am typically a sashimi guy and not a big fan of paying  for mostly rice nigiri, but what the hey nigiri it was. started with some of my favorites uni and ama-ebi naturally they are on the limited to one order list, but thats cool. The Uni was to say the least not at its peak freshness, in fact most normal sushi bars that i frequent would not have served it. Moved on to the hamachi and tuna, edible but not very fresh. Tried the 911 roll it was ok but not nearly as spicy as I would have liked. My associate ordered a spider roll, which the menu claimed was fresh softshell crab (as you would expect) it came out with 2 small crab legs hanging out of each end and a lot of \"Krab\" in the middle, when asked the sushi chef admitted that fake krab was used we pointed out the menu was wrong and sent the roll back, which seemed to offend the chef. If they write fresh crab on the menu and give you Krab, they need to expect that! All in all it was a very mediocre or worse sushi experience, but it was cheap!  The only reason that I gave 2 stars instead of 1 was the Hamachi Kama which was very good, but sadly also on the limited to one list. I'll not be coming back, good luck to the folks that give it five stars.",

Be sure to get there early in the day to make a reservation, the AYCE availability fills up fast at night.  The sushi chefs are very nice and the wait staff is great too!  Be sure to order half orders (4 pieces) so you can try a lot of different rolls.  Remember people, you have to eat the rice too!  Don't get all you can eat and pick the fish off!  And don't complain when they tell you that you have to eat the rice.  If you don't like it then just order sashimi a la carte.",

So, based on my last visit and review of this place, why did I go back?  Because it was a cold rainy night in Vegas and this place was close by.  Believe me, I was looking on Yelp for another Japanese restaurant to try but couldn't find one w/ decent reviews.  The chicken cutlet was horrible.  It appeared to have been cooked once and then deep fried again just prior to serving.  The NY strip - menu describes it as \"...cooked to perfection\" -  actually it was \"overcooked to perfection\".  The thing was like cardboard.  Most of the dishes were pretty bad this visit, which I promise will be my last.",

It's far enough from the Strip that I doubt most tourists will ever hear about it, but I'm really glad I asked Yelp (and my local friend) where to eat sushi on a Friday night.  Sushi Mon does ACYE sushi (all-you-can-eat) the only way you can -- by ordering off a very extensive menu, and ordering more rolls whenever something catches your eye or when you realize you're still hungry. (No stale rolls under buffet glass here!) This only works if the restaurant has great service, and luckily, the wait staff is very prompt here.  If they still have it on the specials menu, you have to try the pastel roll. Unhealthy, for sure, but oh so yummy.  The only drawback was waiting for 45+ minutes for our table on a Friday night. In their defense, we were a pretty big group. We ended up killing time by stocking up on snacks and toiletries at the Smith's across the parking lot.",

We agreed that these may have been the best two rolls that we have ever eaten. The garlic in the Yebisu was definitely not subtle, and the \"orgasm\" sauce on the Ecstasy roll, well, we don't know what it is, but it is delightfully sinful!  We sat at the bar, and were very impressed with the great speed at which these amazing rolls were produced after we ordered each.

Their fish is good quality and they're very accomodating if you have a special order. Their service is attentive and their chefs at the bar are helpful. I'm not the kind of person that like to talk to chit-chat with the chefs much because I don't enjoy the in-your-face type of dining, but they are clearly BUSY.  I love that the appetizers are included in the AYCE price and my favorite are the baked mussels..very rich though. They have a more extensive menu (than the one at the Sahara location) with a great variety of rolls as well as nigiri so they have something for everyone.",

Hell of a deal.   Now the problem with most all you can swallow sushi places is that every roll is on top of a cali roll, the lamest roll ever. Sushi Mon is not that way! I recommend you get a Sunrise, Jala Jala, JJ, Moon, and the sweet shrip upon sitting down. Also the sweet shrimp heads! DELICIOUS!!!!   Also if you like Ponzu sauce, and if don't I hope you have nightmares, you'll love the Albacore, Garlic Tuna, and Yellowtail Collar. That right there should be enough for ya.   Realize also get your Miso soup (if don't finish it you can hid rice in it...shhhh!) And some steamed gyoza. Because you have too!",

All you can eat sushi at good places normally have a wait.   The quality of the fish: I'd have to say this place can be a hit or miss. I've been here numerous times and I've maybe had one or two times where I've felt that the quality was a little sub par, but to say that 80% of the time it tastes really fresh is a good sign for an AYCE sushi place.  The service:  90% of the time, great service! I usually sit at the bar and the chefs are very attentive and fun! They Get your rolls out at a fast pace and if they have time, they usually converse with their bar guests!   TIP: The only thing that may confuse people is that when sitting at the bar, know that all appetizers & desserts or drinks are ordered with the servers and all the rolls, nigiri, and any sushi are ordered through the sushi chef at the bar! :)",

That NEVER happens!! =D  But besides that, I'm glad there's a sushi place located on this side of town that is opened pretty late. It's good for those late night sushi fix and you don't have to go all the way to the busy Chinatown area.  Aside for the Cynthia roll, we order a couple others and they were all delicious. Each order came with 8 pieces.   Cannot justify giving Sushi Mon the full 5 stars because 1. it's a bit pricey if you are planning to order a la carte. I'm a  very small eater...I love trying different sushi rolls but I just CANNOT, will not get AYCE because it won't be worth the price for me. So ordering a la carte, you're looking at $10-14 per order. Also, the place is pretty small which means tables are fairly close to each other. Not a big fan of that...I really don't want the table next to me to hear my mildly-inappropriate conversations to my significant other. ;)",

    "text": "For once, I chose to sit at the sushi bar rather than a table, since it seemed like the main highlight of the restaurant was to sit at the bar (bar took up most of the space). Skeptic to sit at the bar due to my unpleasant, first experience at Hikari, I was surprised to find that there are sushi chefs out there at AYCE places that attentively listen, can figure when you're ready to order again, and make the orders at a quick pace. Thumbs up to the sushi chefs. Their cuts were clean, thick, and perhaps even overpowering compared to the rice.   Sushi Mon's menu is actually quite large in comparison to other AYCE places, specifically their specials menu. I was pleasantly surprised to find Takoyaki on the Appetizers section; that's something you don't usually see nowadays. They also had AYCE Salmon Belly which got me screaming inside with pure joy! Bless! You can also customize your sushi when you talk to the chef. I appreciated the fact that he let me go rice-less with my tamago. There aren't many places that do that for you. For some nigiri such as the scallops, I even added yum yum sauce just for the heck of it. You know, try new things.   I would love to give this place the 5 stars that they deserve, but this sushi joint has one major downfall.   The waiters.   Super inattentive. It seems that whenever I need something from them (water, appetizers, dessert, the BILL), they're just never there. I had to literally hawk my eyes around the restaurant for the first available waiter to tell him my order before he goes back hiding in the kitchen. Several male waiters just kept walking to and from the kitchen, ignoring customers like me that needed assistance, even as I raised my voice and kept saying \"excuse me!\"   However, it seems that for their friends that visited for the evening, their needs are met whenever they ask. There was literally a waiter right next to me that just kept ignoring my requests as his attention was on his friend who happened to be sitting right next to my group at the bar. Thanks for the service. I guess.   Despite the hiccups with the restaurant's waiters, the food here is still solid enough to get me to come back. That is, after I finish my checklist of other AYCE sushi restaurants.",

    "text": "About 9 pm on a Thursday evening, we're off work for the holidays, and craving sushi. So of course it's time for Sushi Mon!  The AYE menu is generous, the staff always friendly, the fish always fresh and my belly always happy and full when I leave. Dang. As I'm writing this review I'm craving it again...  I really like their fried calamari - it's lightly seasoned, fresh, and served with a hint of sauce over a small bed of lettuce.  Here's a tip:  Order from the specials board 1st because items sell out quickly. Be sure to pay attention to the different colored stars since they indicate if you can order 1 per person or more.  My favorite for years was hamachi (yellow tail), but Sushi Mon's super white has taken over. So delicate, fresh, and tender. The halibut is also really nice with just a tiny hint of citrus (I think?).  I also usually love the Sexy Girl (I order a half roll), but the Crispy Rice with spicy tuna will definitely be a repeat.  I always forget my punch card, so thank you for stamping my receipt. Now if I can stop losing my receipts...  No matter, it won't stop me from enjoying Sushi Mon's awesome food!",

We both had the 2 Roll Lunch Combo which comes with 2 Sushi rolls of your choice (from list), salad & miso soup. All this for $8.50!   Items tried and liked (so far):  Miso Soup comes with tofu & wakame.  Salad with Ginger Sesame Dressing California Roll Spicy Tuna Roll Avocado & Asparagus Roll  Everything tasted fresh & yummy!  Service was quick & friendly.  We will definitely be back :)",

You can get half rolls and there is plenty of options. Well priced and I rarely get something I don't enjoy. They have salmon belly sometimes and it's the bomb. Sweet shrimp is a must have.

All my experiences have been 5 star experiences   tip: order half orders on rolls  so you can try multiple.   They have rotating specials not on menu but post it on a board daily, including unique and fresh fresh.   Great service- I enjoy sitting at the bar and having the sushi recommend what I should try- if you're feeling adventurous tell them to just make a nigiri platter for you!   My fav: Ecstasy roll - their \"O\" sauce and seaweed salad on it delish Leash fav: small curry bowl from the kitchen, not a typical red or yellow curry I like - so this prob comes down to personal preference",

    "text": "I reside in Portland where our choices for sushi are limited to mainly dirt cheap conveyor belt style sushi or expensive pretentious style establishments.    Sushi Mon is my 2nd AYCE place I've been to in Vegas and I have to say this place blew me away.  When I discovered they were sister restaurants to Monta Ramen, I felt confident in choosing either Sushi Mon and Goyemon for dinner.    I dined with a large group of 8 and while a wait for a table was incredibly long we were able to be seated at the bar rather quickly.  Honestly I enjoyed eating at the bar and being able to interact with the staff and being able to order items on a whim and be delivered them rather quickly.    I typically stick to things I'm comfortable with when I eat sushi...however due to the AYCE pricing, and due to how damn fresh everything was, and how little rice they put into their sushi, I was able to try damn near 2/3 of the menu.  I must have had 7-8 things I normally don't order such as red snapper, uni, fresh scallop, garlic tuna, super white tuna, octopus, etc.  I was expecting to at least hate some of the things I tried, but I ultimately liked or loved everything I ate.  I was marveling at how fresh looking and tasting everything was relative to what I'm used to in Portland.  Tried a few of their specialty rolls and liked them, but I stuck mainly to nigiri throughout the meal and would suggest you do the same.    I didn't experience any service related issues that others have described, however the price point and the food alone was worthy of 5 stars regardless of service IMO.",

I think they could've used another person on the wait staff during this time.   I tried 7-8 rolls and several side dishes, I enjoyed each one.

The ambience promoted a sense of liveliness, servers enjoyed their jobs, a charismatic hostess seated me, and chefs prepped and served delicious food with energetic passion.  I went in for lunch, anticipating a similar experience. However, the difference was figuratively and literally night and day. The waitstaff appeared burnt out and overwhelmed by a full house of customers. I had an extremely difficult time flagging down servers. The chefs were impassive and merely going through the motions of preparing dishes.  I decided to try something new and ordered the chubby roll, which is as the name describes, a roll of wide girth. Moist crab, eel smothered in sweet teriyaki sauce, and crispy coated tempura shrimp all danced well together inside a pretty coral colored soy paper. However, the sheer size is where it failed. A sushi roll is meant to be eaten whole. If it wasn't like trying to shove a kids size hockey puck in my mouth, I would consider it one of the best on the menu.  Sushi Mon isn't the top of my list, for a lunch service anyway.",

Here, you'll be able to try more sushi in one sitting cus you won't be as full after several orders of nigiri or a couple rolls. Also, you can do half rolls so you don't have to worry about finishing it all unless you're with a big party.  Besides the rice to fish ratio, they have a wide variety of appetizers, sushi and dessert; great service & sushi chefs; plenty parking; but limited seating. We arrived around 9pm and was able to get bar seating right away.   For all you garlic lovers... the garlic edamame is a must try!!  Overall, everything tasted great and satisfied by AYCE sushi on a Saturday night.",

Waiter who helped us told us they are completely out of any sort of kama.  about 15mins later, new customers sat down near us and and they ordered kama. And other server brought it out! I was so confused and asked that server if they have it. He said they randomly found just one kama. What? Okay, just tell me that you guys have biased service to customers. I really liked going there but not anymore. I'm not going to pay same money when I'm not getting same quality services.",

Only about 15 min from the airport, Sushi Mon gets the AYCE job done. Even if you're ordering a la carte. Then the pressure is off, since no one is spying to see if you finished one plate before moving on to another. So many rules with all you can eat that I can't handle.  What to order: seaweed salad, takoyaki, tuna nigiri, sweet crab nigiri, crispy rice roll, and rainbow roll. I had every intention of ordering tempura ice cream but that rice filled up my belly and there wasn't any room for dessert. Then again, a deep fried roll is kind of like dessert anyway.  Beyond sticky rice roll my favorite was takoyaki and tuna nigiri. Fresh, simple, and portions not too large. Just enough. And for the same price of AYCE per person, we got to eat exactly what we wanted without the hassle. Plus a large beer to share.  Yes there's a gazillion places to eat sushi in Vegas. Sushi Mon is worth the wait. It's done right and off of The Strip, so prices reflect the quality not the ambiance.",

I got my usual sushi victims like salmon, yellowtail, and (spicy) tuna hand rolls (VERY good, great spicy tuna, fresh fish all around, and I love well-stuffed hand rolls) and specialty rolls. The Spider Roll and Dragon Roll stood out to me, very delicious. I really enjoyed my dining experience because I'm more about the fish rather than all the other stuff in sushi rolls (if I could just order sashimi for AYCE, I would in a heartbeat) and their fish is fresh and just really wonderful. I'm happy with a big plate of fresh hand rolls and it is absolutely worth $21 (or $26 for dinner) here.",

The rolls sometimes break easily when trying to grab it, but for the most part are very well made. What really pleased me was the service. It is FAST!

Its crazy like nothing I've ever been to. Its totally okay tho its almost like making reservations, we called an hour and a half in advanced kinda crazy! The inside is rather small, like literally maybe only 10 tables and a sushi bar. The sushi was delicious, all you can eat for $25.00. Ive also gotten the beef udon soup. The broth of the soup is simply delicious, haven't had better udon soup anywhere else! Prices aren't too bad, they are like any sushi place, pretty much. Service was great our waitress was pretty funny and nice. Again, this definitely isn't a spot that you could just randomly drop into when you want because the wait is far too long! Plan ahead and call in when you are at home and see how long the wait is and you'll be okay (;",

    "text": "Let's face a fact: AYCE and excellent sushi were never meant to go hand in hand.  That is, unless you consider California roll to be sushi, in which case you'd need some sushi education.  This place serves higher than the average buffet quality of sushi, many popular side items, and rolls, all at a low price of $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner. I can safely say that the quality is much better than every other AYCE sushi bar that I've eaten at by a long shot, but that's not to imply that the other places were overwhelmingly difficult to beat.  Pros: - Price. If you don't order like an idiot (\"let's order rolls\") you will definitely get more than what you pay for. - On their AYCE, with the exception of sea urchin nigiri, sweet shrimp nigiri, sashimi salad, and yellowtail collar (maximum one order each, per customer) everything else can be ordered as many times as you want. - Their miso soup is delicious! It comes with a sweet shrimp head in it.  Cons: - Inconveniently located away from the Las Vegas strip. - This place is always busy. Good luck on weekend nights. - Good service is something of a rarity.",

Ok there was one kid and he was really nice. Really it's like fishing. You just sit and wait and maybe you'll get to eat. And pay the 25/person bill.   Sushi isn't bad.

    "text": "Sushi Mon definitely lives up to its hype. A couple of friends recommended this place to me as a must stop in Vegas. I was reassured this is the place to be as soon as I heard Japanese coming from the chefs.  Can't get more authentic than that, right?   We came in right at opening 11:45am, even skipped breakfast to make sure we have plenty of room for the raw fish. There were only a couple of others waiting anxiously for them to open up. We had the option of sitting at the bar or table, went with the latter to accommodate our group of 4. Our server came up immediately to get our drinks started. We decided to go with the AYCE sushi. You can't go wrong paying 21.95 for good quality fish.  I decided to start off with the salmon belly, which was melt-in-your-mouth good.  I would highly recommend getting this belly if you see it on their special menu. They ran out in just 10 minutes.  Everything else was delicious and fresh!  Restaurant filled up quickly but there wasn't much of a wait until we left the restaurant around 1. I was also worried at the 45 minute time limit they have posted everywhere. How can anyone eat in 45 minutes when you have to wait for your food every time you put an order in? But luckily this rule was not enforced.  I noticed that there are plenty of people ordering from the lunch menu.  That's something I'd consider if I were a local. But since I'm not, I had to take advantage of the all you can eat menu.    Another huge plus of this restaurant is the insane 2 am closing time. I don't think I'd crave raw fish past midnight, but Vegas never sleeps, right? There is another location closer to the strip on Sahara. I accidentally came to this location because it came up on my Yelp search. But my local friend said that the other location is the original restaurant, and can get more crowded.  I'd have to check out the other one on my next trip.  I highly recommend this place! Friendly staff + reasonable price + great food = one happy returning customer!",

The fact that I can order a lychee sherbet, plum sherbet, AND red bean ice cream for dessert makes it so worth it. :)  Also make sure to check out the daily specials that are posted on the walls.",

    "text": "We went last night kind of late for the AYCE dinner.  Being from Reno, the capital of AYCE sushi, we were too spoiled to spend for a la carte anywhere else in Vegas, and this place was recommended by a few people.  Checking yelp and looking over the menu we got excited, the variety was great.   I like to start with nigiri but the fish looked bad, my yellowtail had a lot of different shades to it, maybe it's the way they cut it or maybe it's just kind of old but they do give good fish to rice ratiio.  Also, the salmon didn't come with lemon on it as it does at my favorite place back home, and the sushi chef was fairly inattentive when I wanted to ask for some slices so I just dealt with it. The long rolls were not anything to write home about either.  They were loosely rolled and had a lot of rice, so much that when I picked one up it fell into soy sauce which splattered ALL over me.  When this happened, the sushi chef offered soda water, which was nice, but it didn't have to happen at all.   We ordered a couple rolls with no issue but when my boyfriend ordered the Monster roll, thinking it would be piled high with fish, we got disappointed.  The chef made something that looked delicious then piled a whole bowl worth of rice onto it, rolled it up and served it.  My boyfriend decided the only way he could fit it in his mouth would be to take out the actual roll and discard the rice.  He told the waiter he wasn't going to eat it and the waiter was very nice, saying he would have warned him if he'd asked, stating it might be better for a table of 5 people (it's only 5 slices).  We just wish the chef had warned us. But we weren't charged for not eating the rice which was good, cause they charge over $12 for that roll, and that's almost half the cost of dinner.   So, to summarize, love the AYCE, love the late hours and variety of rolls.  There was so much we wanted to try that we didn't get a chance to.    Service is also excellent but the chef could've been better/more service oriented.",

I usually eat enough nigiri to make the trip and price worth while but as a discerning certified asian, I eat muuuuch more than I can handle.  I can eat way more fish than the $25.95 all you can eat price.  Only restriction is one uni and amaebi dish per person (and one toro when they have it).  The tempura here is very well done and somehow, in the middle of a desert, the fish is quite fresh.  Definitely a place I'd go back to when I'm in town.",

    "text": "This is good... that is the simplest most correct way of talking about Sushi Mon... scratch that this is REALLY good.  I was suggested this place by a friend and I have been back 4 times in 2 weeks (alright I do have a sushi problem).  The fish here is fresh, the chefs have great suggestions as to new things to try and it is AYCE!!!  I even drive down from North Las Vegas for this sushi.  I am a big Uni (sea urchin) fan and have been consistently impressed with the quality.  My father (who used to go to Japan for business often) said that it was some of the best uni that he has had in the US.  The problem is they do limit you.  The other fish on the menu has consistantly been fresh and delicious.  Don't be afraid to try new things along with the gold standards (yellowtail, tuna, salmon) as they are all good.  Like most of the AYCE sushi places I have been to you can order anything on the menu including appetizers and dessert.  The menu is a good size with a nice variety of fish and rolls.  Another positive is that if you are the only diner for AYCE you can order half rolls.  This sushi place didn't try to fill me up on rice or give me a paper thin slice of fish.  I would rate this sushi place high for the AYCE AND the sitdown sushi places.  I guess that they have another location but I haven't been there.  Seating can be rough but I haven't had to wait long... for even less time sit at the sushi bar.",

Not only is everything fresh, but you get a menu where you can choose from. Of course the really expensive stuff you get limited to 2/person, but its totally worth it.   The price is again, like buffets, per person so don't bother brining people that can't eat a lot or else it's not even worth it. The sweet shrimp is awesome and make sure you tell them to fry the head and eat it, caz its a delicacy. This is definitely the place I'm going to when I'm in Vegas.",

Sat at the bar and ordered the all you can eat in which the customer is timed at 45 mins to eat. Dinner started off bad because I ordered a roll and the sushi chef drowned it in a sweet sauce. And when I say drowned, the bottom of the plate showed no white. I told the sushi guy that I didn't want the roll because he drowned it in sweet sauce. He accused me putting too much soy sauce. Really!? My meal was ruined, I ate the most basic califorrnia and philly rolls, had my plum icecream and peaced the place out. Truly, truly disappointed. Not to mention, the fish was not well kept.",

    "text": "Whenever I see the words \"sushi\" and \"buffet\" combined together, images of horrible, unmentionable evil spring to mind and I am left a cowering mess underneath a table somewhere.  So when I found myself in Vegas in a rush for a sushi fix, Sushi Mon was brought to my attention.  A buffet, I cautiously whispered.  This can't be good.  But no - looking at the Yelp reviews, it defiantly stared back at me w/ its four star rating and dared me to say anything to the contrary.  Fine, I told myself.  *I* will be the judge of that.  The verdict:  It wins.  The place is pretty damn awesome.  It's a quick drive from the strip (and on top of that, it's easy to navigate to which helps a lot for newbs) and parking is simple b/c it's located right in a strip mall.  Strip mall sushi buffet = ZOMGWTFBBQ BAD, right?  RIGHT?!  No, damn you!  This place is GOOD!!!  The buffet is less than $30 / person for dinner and considering that each roll is about $10, you're getting a deal and a half going for the buffet option.  And unlike most sushi buffets that like to give you a high rice/fish ratio for their rolls, this place keeps that ratio relatively low and gives you a decent amount of fish per roll.  The rolls are decently sized and tasty.  I'm a big fan of spicy tuna rolls (I can hear all the purists groaning) and this place has the \"911 Roll\" which is THE SPICIEST TUNA ROLL EVER.  It's like eating fire wrapped around some tuna, rice and seaweed.  It is beyond brilliant.  If you're in the Las Vegas area and want to fill up on some quality sushi at a steal of a price, Sushi Mon is the place to be.  +1 for the late hours.",

THIS BEING SAID, I'VE JUST READ THAT THEY CHANGED OWNERSHIP AND THAT THE QUALITY HAS VASTLY CHANGED.

The quality of the fish is great, variety is awesome, and pricing for about $26.95 for adults (one hour time limit) at dinner time (a little less for lunch) is well worth it if you're hungry.   They have all the usual nigiri favorites and an extensive list of sushi rolls. What blew my mind was the Ikura and Quail Egg...oh baby...my brother-in-law introduced me to this and now it's one of my favorite bites to eat. Needless to say, we had way too many on our last visit.  You can also order regular Japanese dishes like shrimp/vegetable tempura, hamachi kama, miso soup, and the like...which we did. But it really was the sushi that I enjoyed the most.  The only slightly disappointing thing we encountered was there's really no kids menu available. Kids 2-years-old and under do eat free, but if you're kids are older than that (like my son) then expect to pay ala carte prices to get that kid fed or splurge on another all-you-can-eat.  Other than that, we had a great time and would definitely return again if we are hungry for good quality sushi off the strip.",

It's also nice that when you do All-you-can-eat, your nigiri rice isn't packed in so big/tight that it's basically a rice cake under a thin layer of fish.

I was too scared to get the AYCE because of the pressure to finish every bit of sushi including the rice, I knew I wouldn't be able to eat it all, so I ordered the super salmon roll and the pixie roll.  Loved the super salmon roll but I wished it had some avocado and cucumber in it along with the salmon for extra flavor.  Fish tasted extremely fresh.  I was not crazy about the pixie roll, as I was not a fan of that yum yum creamy shrimp.  This, plus the soy paper made the roll a bit too sweet for my tastes.  We also had the teriyaki chicken and fried oyster appetizers, the teriyaki chicken was tasty but I liked the chicken better at Yummy.  The oysters were fresh and tasted good but the thick sauce it comes with was not that great.  Giving this four stars because the fish tasted so fresh and the food came out insanely quick.  And, they are only a few minutes from the house.  I'd go here again maybe when i'm ready to try AYCE.  I also liked how they didn't restrict the menu when you order all you can eat, you just get whatever you want.  When I did it at KA on green valley parkway, they kept coming back telling me I had to pick something else.",

    "text": "Living in Vegas for the past few weeks, and I've stayed far away from the buffet lines.  However, I have also been missing out on my sushi runs and finally had the opportunity for some raw fish this past weekend.  Having been to their sister restaurant on Sahara, I was familiar with Sushi Mon's all-you-can-eat menu.  For $29.95, you have an hour to chow down on nigiri, rolls, appetizers, tempura, and dessert.  For those not wanting to participate in the race, you can order from their a la carte menu as well.    For such limited items like Amaebi (don't forget to ask for the fried heads that come with them!) and Uni, it's only one order (a pair) per person.  Otherwise, diners like myself would have them running out of that stuff quick!  I also had some of their nigiri, and their specialty rolls - 9-1-1 Roll, Spider Roll, and Pixie Roll among others.  I had a better experience with their Hamachi Collar this time compared to my experience at the other Sushi Mon.  Order half orders on the rolls so you can try more out and aren't stuck with 8 pieces all to yourself!   And for dessert - I like their Plum Sherbet, Lychee Sherbet, and Green Tea Ice Cream.  I never made it around to their Mochi this time unfortunately.  Update! 09/14/07 - I made the mistake of ordering their Spider Roll which is huge and filled with crab meat filler!  Blah!  Be sure to ask what their daily fish specials are.  They had bonito and live scallops when we went, and the scallop was pretty good.  Their scallop nigiri is cooked scallop, which is something I didn't really care for.  I got a chance to try their Mochi Vanilla this time, yum!  I think I did a good job of eating my fill!  Sidenote: They offer frequent eater cards!  Eat 10 times there and get one free!  They don't take reservations!   Update! 03/11/08 - I finally tried their vanilla mochi and it was yummy.  Forgot to check what their daily fish specials were, which was probably a big mistake. Their ahi poke has nice cuts of tuna and seaweed mixed together, add a bit of soy to it though.",

    "text": "I had to write this review in response to the review by Joey S. of the $10 dollar special for their anniversary. We had the same issue, that is, we got there and they weren't taking anymore names since the amount of names they had would last them until closing time. That is perfectly reasonable considering they have to go home some time. They weren't taking reservations. The names in their waiting book were from people who got there before you and put their names in first. There's a difference between reservations and putting your name in way ahead of time in person at the restaurant. Sorry, we were both bested by others who got there before us.   when they say they're not doing it anymore because too many people are there, consider the language barrier and assume they mean they can't cater to all the people who showed up due to seating and time constraints. They are not trying to get cheap on you and end the deal.  They always have great quality food and friendly service. I highly recommend them.",

Usually one of my favorite places to go because a few of the chefs and servers are really friendly and it is close to my house. I have recently changed my schedule and have to go later in the evening which means longer waits to get a table. Along with this comes bad service. As it gets later the better chefs here get off and they have a bunch of new people that are not as friendly or good behind the bar. They also recently changed managers and promoted a server to that position, which is not a good change. What irritates me in particular is one waitress who usually takes over service of the sushi bar when she comes in and she would rather talk to coworkers and hide in the back then actually take care of customers. I have been a loyal customer for years and the food is always good but the service here is getting to the point where I am starting to look for another ayce sushi joint. So if you want great service this is not the place for you.",

From our previous experience we called in to make sure they had conch tonight since it was the speciality dish. Since they guaranteed that they had plenty of conch we decided to head over. After waiting for an hour they seated us and took our order. As patiently waited for my order the server came back and said we only have one piece (we had 5 people) I was stocked we drove 20 mins from the strip to the restaurant and the tell us they don't have that anymore. After that the manager came and didn't even apologize and said if you are not happy you can pay and leave. I cannot believe this restaurant got such high review for such terrifying service. This restaurant do not put customers first and all they cared about was money the seafood is no longer fresh compared to the past. This will be the last time we go.",

I was kind of annoyed by the waiter that came like a million times to bug us about collecting our plates and eventually we anticipated him coming so we did the work by stacking the plates and putting it on the side.  Aside from that, the food was so good that I will keep returning.  I like sitting at the bar because the sushi chefs are nice and come every now and then to ask if we wanted to order anything. I will definitely come back here again.",

    "text": "All-You-Can-Eat & High Quality Sushi are normally two things that I wouldn't associate together. Until now. Their full menu is available for the AYCE price, and it's a very wide menu. The rolls and cuts are made to order and the fish was very fresh. I love that you can order half-rolls so you can try lots of different ones. I had my doubts as to how good this place would be after my friends had talked it up so much, but I was not disappointed. I must've tried at least 9 different types of rolls, a couple of handrolls, tuna poki and we finished off with a refreshing lychee sorbet that cleaned the palate wonderfully.   Service was definitely on top of it and the sushi chefs behind the counter seemed very enthusiastic and were having fun being there. The place isn't very big, so even full, all of our food came out very quickly and our table waiter came back frequently to find out our next orders. It took some effort to control myself from ordering everything on the menu, but I believe my heart appreciated it.   I think a return to Sushimon will be a must for my next trip to Vegas.",

Yes, the case with all the fish in it.    We walked out.  That is wrong.  Won't be going back.",

I would say this sushi mon got the better menu!  I came here, it was about $35 with tax and tip for ayce sushi!  No sashimi but they do have nigri.  Very good selection and their hamachis are delicious!    All their rolls were great especially the 911 roll!  Very spicy and tasty!    They say it's ayce for 1 hour but we ended up staying for 2 and no one said anything!  Also, 1 hr is a long time to eat!  We stayed for two because we were talking but we weren't eating the whole time.  The selection here are pretty fresh and I wouldn't say at all that it was low quality sushi!    People here are friendly and don't make faces or anything when you order and order!    My favorite spot to go to in Las Vegas when I come visit!  Also, they have tempura ice cream!

Whatever sushi you are craving, I'm sure they will have it or something close to it. Lots of side dishes and deserts are also part of the AYCE menu!   Whenever someone says, \"I found a good AYCE Sushi place.\" I respond with, \"Is it as good as Sushi-Mon.\" The answers vary from \"No\" to \"Close\" but never \"It's better than Sushi-Mon\".",

    "text": "I love Sushi Mon for their nigiri sushi specials such as toro and salmon belly which I don't find all the time at other AYCE sushi restaurants! The medium toro and salmon belly are just so deliciously fresh and melt in your mouth. They're not always on the menu though so be aware of that and if it is, it might be limited to one order/person. The other nigiri sushi like salmon, yellowtail, and white tuna have been my other favorites as well.   I love getting edamame and shrimp tempura here since it's pretty fresh but I've tried the takoyaki and fried gyoza and was disappointed by how soft and full of dough they were.   As for rolls, the selection is smaller than other AYCE sushi places unfortunately. The only roll that really stood out to me was the Lemon roll which had yellowtail and salmon with sliced lemon on the top to combine the flavors.   For desserts, you can pick more than one! The mochi ice cream is pretty good. I also love the specials they have for desserts - I recently got mango mochi ice cream and yuzu ice cream which were both delicious!   Sushi Mon's AYCE price at $26.95 is great for the quality of nigiri sushi and fun diversity of daily specials but I still wish there were more selection for the appetizers and rolls!",

I've done the all-you-can-eat option each time I've been in just to be able to try a bunch of things and I haven't been disappointed. There is WAY better sushi out there, but this place is better than you might expect.  The staff is outstanding, super friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating. They know/understand/accommodate gluten-free options very well. My wife, who is very sensitive to gluten did the all-you -can-eat and had no problem finding plenty of tasty options.   4 stars for two reasons. The sushi is really good, but not amazing. Also, they have a LOT of rules, and they post them everywhere. They don't seat partial parties so if you are the 1st of 6 people coming, you're not getting seated until the other 5 show up. There is a laminated card with rules for the all-you-can-eat option: No sharing, charges for leftovers, 45 min time limit for lunch and 1hr for dinner, etc.. Rules plastered on the window talking about \"last call\" and \"last order\" and all of that. I think I get it, but it doesn't make for the most welcoming of environments.  I'll totally go back again, and probably skip the all-you-can-eat and just pick a few things I know are good.",

    "text": "I had been craving sushi for a few weeks now...Thursday night after work, my fella decided that after cashing checks, we would hit up Sushi Mon.  This location was closer to where we were, so rather than driving ALL the way over to the other location, we came over here.  In terms of service, it is hands down GREAT service.  I'd venture to say better than their other location, as I have NEVER had bad service here.   All of the servers were polite, and even joked around with us a few times.  There was one order of unagi that we ended up sending back, because it looked significantly less cooked/seared than the last 3 orders we had received.  The servers took it back with no problem, apologizing profusely, and asking if we wanted it prepared again.  They brought it back and it was perfect.   Now for the fish!!  The quality of fish at the location, just like the Sahara location, is always good.  I've never had anything that was downright BAD, or off.    This trip we had:  Super white:  my favourite of all time!!  It almost melts in your mouth.  Unagi:  Yum.  We order this 4 orders (each order is 2 pieces) at a time Cajun Albacore: Light spice, and very delcious Ebi: perfect! Sardines: These were on special, and I'm not a fan.  The texture was good, but there was a very fishy aromatic flavor that I'm not fond of.  Fella liked them.  Negi-toro: weird texture, but good.  (blue fin tuna belly wrapped in seaweed.) Conch: almost a lemon flavor...delicious. Garlic tuna: My second favourite of the night.  SO flavorful! Tako (octopus): My first time NOT having this in a salad.  It was surprisingly tender, and very good.  We also had fried gyoza (3 or 5 orders, or something like that), seaweed salad, and sake.  (Ok, I had a lot of sake.  It was delicious, I couldn't  help it.)   I love the AYCE option here, as it includes anything off the appetizer menu, and also dessert.    For dessert, I had the green tea creme brulee.  If you have NOT tried this yet, you must.  It is amazing.  All in all, Sushi Mon remains my favourite AYCE sushi place, and both locations are equally good.",

None of the servers asked us how we were doing or whether we wanted to order more. Oh no, wait! One person did ask when she was giving us our bill which we haven't even asked for yet. I guess that's one thing they are really attentive with. Never, ever coming back. Worst service ever!  Nothing special about the food either.",

First we get there and we spot 2 clean tables, 20 min wait... fine we took the bar that was open the server had to wipe it off and left the whole counter wet from the dirty rag that they used. Also, never received any ginger or wasabi yet the couple next to us that came in shortly after got there's. Started off with two orders of shrimp tempura, undercooked and the taste was minimal. Garlic tuna nigiri was the cheapest tasting tuna I've ever had, hardly any sauce. The royal California roll, deep fried, was burnt and not edible. Fried eel was served raw on the dragon roll. Used to come here but it has obviously seen better days. Never coming back here, and I don't advise anyone else to.",

I have been feigning for raw fish and the last experience at Goyemon (service was lackluster, out of uni, out of lychee sorbet) and at Tomo Sushi (service was wonderful, but uni didn't taste fresh, the sauces on some pieces of nigiri wasn't great, desserts were not good), were not good.  Finally, we decided to give Sushi Mon a try.  I know it is from the same Goyemon family, so I was hoping that they have all the same items, but may be better service?  We dined at 6pm yesterday and we got a table right away.  I was excited to see salmon belly, toro, Hamachi kama on the specials board.  I was so excited that I couldn't contain myself, and spilled soy sauce on my place mat.  A lot of sauce.  But, the waiter didn't care...business as usual.  Didn't offer napkins, another place mat, nada.  As soon as our orders of nigiri came out, I didn't care as well.  The toro was not bad, conch was not sweet, but the salmon belly and super white were delicious!  We ordered a total of 6 orders of salmon belly and super white, and other (hotate was not as fresh and sweet as the ones we had at Goyemon before, saba was ok, didn't care for the meintako, the ikura with quail egg is good, Hamachi kama was yummy, ameabi was small but sweet).  I ended the meal with 3 scoops of lychee sorbet.  I was quite satisfied.",

I was hoping for an iced tea but had to settle for a matcha tea instead.   We each ordered a round of miso soup, a side of garlic edamame, and all you can eat sushi. The food was delivered pretty quickly and was pretty delicious.  The all you can eat lunch is a decent price. And if you aren't up to eating a ton of sushi, they also have some lunch specials that are a bit smaller and less price.",

    "text": "So I think this place has gone down quite since a year ago, but I guess their longevity may speak contrary to this review.   First point, customer service is awful. Went there last Friday and was waiting for a table for 2 for a few minutes when the server sat us. Great, right? But a few minutes after being seated and waiting for our drinks already, a different server came and asked us to leave (not just move) but they were trying to set up a table for 14 and they need our table. So maybe miscommunication about the tables within the servers. We understand and waited 45 more minutes for a table. We could have left but this meant if we go somewhere else we would be at the end of the wait list again for another hour. So against our better judgment, we stayed.  At the end of the night, our last order did not taste fresh and tasted pretty metallic (which for raw fish means it's not fresh). We told our server about it and she said she will let the kitchen know and not to worry about eating it. When we asked for our check, the host told us \"we have to eat all of it or we would be charged\" even after our server said not to worry about it. The server and the host argued for a bit and we were just exasperated that I told them to just bring whatever bill.   Maybe it was just the two servers running the dinner shift. Food was other wise good, except for the last sushi order. But definitely not going back cause of the customer service.",

The AYCE is the way to go though regardless because it's $26 and even if you don't eat a ton, order a couple rolls, nigiri orders and appetizers and you'll far exceed that amount for dinner anyways. I wish we did the AYCE because we ended up spending $70 anyways and it would have been $78 for all of us to get all you can eat. I didn't get to try the uni, sweet shrimp, or more expensive pieces so I'll definitely have to come back! Service was attentive even though the place was quite busy and there was a wait on a Wednesday at 6pm for a table so we sat at the bar",

    "text": "I've been coming to Sushi Mon for almost eight years now.  Nothing has changed.  I think the price has stayed the same the whole time.  For the most part, it's a great meal every time.  The knifework on the fish is sometimes inconsistent on some nights, but my most recent visit was great.  For $26.95, you get AYCE ordered off a menu and made to order.  The quality of the sushi is great.  And they're very good about keeping the ball of rice for each nigiri small.  The ratio of fish to rice is always very good and you don't feel like they're just trying to fill you up on rice by giving you a large ball of rice under each piece of fish.  The selection is expansive.  They do custom orders as well, so I always ask for a few orders of salmon nigiri with yuzu sauce, lemon, and jalapeno.  It's an item that used to be on the menu years ago, but lots of people still order it so they'll know what you're talking about.  If salmon belly is offered on the specials board, get lots of that.  They also have a large variety of rolls and you are allowed to order half rolls.  Aside from sushi, there's a large selection of side dishes as well.  From fried gyoza to udon soup to baked mussels, everything you want is there.  I usually end up eating three bowls of seaweed salad on my own.  And don't forget to get the garlic edamame!  Dessert is amazing as well.  You can get unlimited mochi ice cream.  The menu lists strawberry and mango, but the specials board will usually have green tea.  It's always served at an appropriate temperature so the mochi skin is soft while the ice cream is still solid.  They also have options for scoops of ice cream and the lychee sorbet is delicious.  The best thing they serve here is the grilled hamachi collar.  Don't miss out on it!  And get the salmon collar as well, even though it's not as good.  We missed out on the salmon collar as they ran out around 5:30pm.  Few tips: -Their best nigiri is not on the menu.  It's salmon belly nigiri with yuzu, a slice of lemon, and a slice of jalapeno.  Ask for it and they'll make it.  -You can order hand rolls too.  Get a salmon skin hand roll.  -The best apps are the calamari and the grilled mussels.  Order lots of these.  -Don't get the chicken skewer.  It's always dry.",

They were nice and busy,  but had a few spots for us at the bar.  We started with some sake, and edamame.  My friend ordered the all you can eat and I just did a la cart because I wanted less fluff and more fish (I have learned that when you order the all you can eat sushi,  too...i usually don't get the good cuts,  understandably so). I ordered the salmon belly special and an order of gyoza. Both were super tasty! All of the rolls my friend had looked fabulous,  and the service was wonderful. I'm sure it will become a regular spot.",

It is however a very close second to some of these 5star restaurants. The ambiance is not deserving of a True 4 star restaurant however the food is that good couple with experience they it makes the OVERALL experience 4star.

I've eaten at Sushi Mon in more occasions than I'd like to count.  The food is always absolutely amazing, the rolls they've created are very cool and perfectly balanced, and the service is always top notch.  However, be warned that they are a smaller place and very popular!  Be sure to get there early, make a reservation, or expect a wait. It's hard to get a table quickly sometimes. But trust me, it's worth it!",

I know all the rolls I like, so I probably have a bit of a bias too. I figured it was just average, or a little below average quality of fish since we're in Vegas and the price was so nice, but not that case. My wife and I went to Hawaii recently, and expected to be blown away by the high price sushi from the recommended sushi spots, but not the case. The clean taste of Sushi Mon held up in the comparison.   Little kids can share for just $3 in the all you can eat. Our 3 year old loves gyoza, and we definitely get our money's worth from that and the nigiri he eats. The staff is super friendly, and there is included dessert with AYCE.   No reservations, but they do have a text system once you arrive if there is a wait.",

We had several rolls: sexy girl, athena, tiger, and 911 (which was disappointingly un-spicy). For nigiri we opted for uni (limit one per person for ayce), salmon, scallop and tuna.  We also had two orders of their calamari which was great. All in all the food was fresh, service friendly and on point. I am marking one star off because Athena roll was bland and 911 roll was not as spicy as advertised.",

If you haven't been before it's like $27 i think it was...for all you can eat sushi, rule is no leftovers, and you have to finish the rice.  If your getting rolls I would also recommend ordering half rolls unless u knw of a specific one you really like and know you'll finish with no problems...  We sat at the bar and service was great.  The sushi guy was always checking to see how we were doing with a smile...  Ok, onto the food!  I think I had to be rolled outta the place, everything was so goowd!    Starters: Green shell mussels are a MUST!!!  I'm usually not a fan but they were really good! Dynamite was just ok and a lil oily... Miso soup, tasty and had good amount of tofu.  You can order it with shrimp heads if you want a seafood miso...I think it's alright but my friend loves it... Shrimp tempura...gotta love it!  Serves hot and perfectly fried  For the nigiri everything was so fresh!  We had garlic salmon, yellowtail, and mackerel (my favorite...fishy I knw but yum!). Order was done quick and don't be afraid to ask for any sauce or extras like jalapenos like we did...(not that it didn't taste great, I just always add extra!   =)  Onto the rolls!  We had the 911 roll...like a spicy tuna roll on crack!  Doesn't seem hot when you put it in your mouth, but like 3.2 seconds later it hits ya and your looking for high quality H2O!   =p  JJ roll...tempura, avocado, asparagus, cream cheese...tasty!!!  And the Sexy Girl Roll...hard time remembering what's in this one...shrimp, scallions, crab meat, avocado maybe?  Very good!...BUT!  This is why I recommend ordering half rolls till u knw what u really like...it was towards the end and was SO hard finishing,   I did (somehow!) save enough room for desert which is included...choice between green tea, red bean and tempura ice cream.  And vanilla and strawberry mochi balls.  We had strawberry mochi balls, great way to end meal!  And red bean ice cream!  Yummo!    Great way to get GOOD sushi!  Much better then strip places in my opinion!    Ok, that was my 1st review!!!  Hope it wasn't too long n hope it helps!!!    =)",

The 4 of us got there at about 7:30pm on a Wednesday night and had about an hour and a half wait. Besides the reservationist/cashier being a little on the rude side, and the all you can eat sushi menu only allowing each person only 1 order of uni, ama ebi, and the hamachi kama each, the fish was very fresh, and they had nice size cuts of fish on their nigiri sushi. All in all I'd give it a thumbs, and will be returning there on my next visit to Las Vegas! I just hope the reservationist/cashier doesn't read this or the next time my wait will be even longer, buahahaha.",

But there was literally nothing on the menu worth the money, at least from what I tried. The food was just overly bland.

The restaurant isn't that big, but it just shows that great things come in small packages! :)  They have a great selection of sushi and specialty rolls for you to choose from.  The staff is friendly and seated us right away. I normally don't opt to sit at the bar but the decision turned out to be great. We were able to order directly from the chef. The fish was fresh and rolls had a little bit more rice than I'd like but the flavors of the rolls made up for it. I ordered the Pixie roll. It's a play on the spider roll and was so delicious. If I still had room after all the different rolls I tried, I probably would have ordered myself another Pixie roll.   They offered a wide range of appetizers as well as desserts (not many places includes dessert in the AYCE menu). For you seaweed lovers, they have seaweed salad on the menu, we each ordered a bowl. They also offered baked mussels, miso  soup, calamri, and much much more! I ended my meal with a generous scoop of green tea ice cream, and my sister had a strawberry mochi ice cream. I will definitely be going back when I'm in town.",

We ordered salmon belly, yellowtail belly, baked mussels, and various rolls that I can't even remember all their names. We even ordered a baked chicken roll, which was not typical, but was unexpectedly tasty! The salmon, yellowtail and baked mussels were my favorites though. The fish was very fresh. Sometimes it's best to keep it simple, especially when you're eating so much!  We thought we would not have much room for dessert, so we decided to share a scoop of strawberry mochi ice cream, lychee sorbet and green tea ice cream. The lychee sorbet was really good, with real chunks of lychee on the inside, but the real winner was the strawberry mochi ice cream. We loved it so much we ordered two more scoops.   Service was good, though there was a little misunderstanding with quantity (make sure you know how much is in an order) and you can't beat the lunch price of $22 per person.   My only wish is that they would serve uni for lunch, but will definitely be back!",

The choices were awesome though, warm sake was great, and never can go wrong with kirin beer.  The food was delicious except when I tried their spicy ahi, DANG, that was spicy.",

I really like that they offer half rolls as an option for the all you can eat, that way you try/enjoy a variety of rolls - they do have a lot to choose from.   It's pretty small and does tend to fill up; that being said, I've never waited for a table. One more thing about the atmosphere, the music in the main restaurant is always top 40 blah. In the restrooms they play some throw backs. The last time I was there I heard The Humpty Dance, I think they need to switch up the stations and get that playing where the tables are.",

We just wandered around while we waited.   Once we got seated they got us drinks pretty fast and we sat at the bar so we were able to tell them right away that we were doing ayce and start ordering.   I wasn't a fan of their cucumber salad. I think they should have it chopped differently. I also wasn't a fan of the naked mussels or tempura.   The red snapper was delicious as was the garlic tuna.   The wait staff was terribly unattentive. It made their 60 minute rule for ayce seem unfair. They checked on us maybe twice.  All in all it's ok but I prefer going elsewhere",

Sushi Mon you let us down and that's sad cause we always made a trip to eat here every time we visit and always recommend you to any friends who was visiting. We waited over an hour and 1/2, when your text said 40mins. Double sad that we left when you 3 empty seats open at the bar. At the two hour mark you sent a text and called but we had long gone since your hostess was rude and just didn't care.",

After I bought  a place in Silverado Ranch in '01, Sushi Mon opened up 6 months later and it was great. I believe it's Japanes owned and often the staff are foreign exchange students going to UNLV.   The service has always been good, and the sushi a great value. Love the late night all-you-can-eat. Kind of funny how they have to over emphasize the \"rules\" of all you can eat, but I guess it comes with the territory.  I get back to Vegas 3-4 times a year and always make sure I have a car to visit Sush-Mon and the buffet and M Casino.  I have lived in Hawaii and now Seattle and I still think and crave Sushi-Mon in the desert of Vegas more often than the sushi establishments in these oceanside States.",

I expected to be out of there around 5 but now it's 6 and I have work at 7 and I was supposed to go to is sweet ugh irritates me when I can't get my daily sweets  like seriously I ordered baked green mussles first and that was the last thing that I got before paying the check. I think our server was Anthony? Well he kept messing up our orders and I asked for the mussles like 3-4 times before I got them. And I ordered one green salad and a poki tuna but I ended up getting two green salads and no poki tuna I had to remind them twice. Like cmon guys it wasn't even busy. Definitely not coming back here when I have somewhere to be because that just totally took all my time and I'm always on a time crunch",

The cuts of fish were above what is typical for an AYCE sushi gig. The scallop nigiri was fresh and tasty. The cut of fish simply named \"white fish\" was really good, too. I could eat unagi anything all day long.   They have many rolls to experience as well. My personal favorite was the spider roll which was huge, and had the best combo of ingredients and sauces. I like that you can order half orders of rolls, so that you can try a greater variety.   The desserts were wonderful, too! The vanilla and strawberry mochi ice cream balls were the best. The tempura ice cream ball was next best, and the green tea (wasabi-looking) ice cream came in at a close third place.  The best part about this place is all of the choices! You get to try such a variety of great-tasting different things, and even experiment with things you've never had the opportunity to try before.   An entertainment aspect of Sushi Mon is they have some pretty awesome names for their rolls... We had many \"that's what she said\" comments with their creative names, especially the famed \"Monster Roll\". I also can't wait to try multiples of the Orgasm Roll next time! Should be a real treat! ;)",

We went for lunch and saw the lunch special: 2-roll combination comes with a side salad and miso soup. Our waitress was courteous and came back several times to take our order (I need pictures to decide!).   I ended up ordering the spicy shrimp and Unagi roll.   The food didn't come out all at the same time, but when you're busy, you're busy, and she brought the food out as soon as it was ready.  I thought they'd serve half (4 and 4) roll portions to make one roll but they actually served a 16-piece lunch.  Oh. Emm. Jee.  That was too much, but the rolls were good; soup was good (Miso generally tastes the same to me where ever), salad was fine (too much dressing for me). But it was a steal @ $8.50  :)  I would definitely return with an appetite and with or without a limited budget.  :)",

We had a party of 10 people and we were willing to squish and he was NOT willing to accommodate?! Wtf...  Nigiri comes with a big piece of rice thats hella hard, and we were supposed to eat all of them?! I would have if they cooked it better. and employee kept pushing us to finish the damn rice. Ugh  They gave us 45 min limit for all u can eat but it took them half hour to bring out each order...what?  Mediocre in every aspects.",

    "text": "I'm from LA and my family was staying down the street over at South Point. My dad found this before we left for the vacation and decided we wanted to try it.  Originally, he was going to do a la carte instead of AYCE. He definitely does not regret his choice.   Sitting at the bar is a better experience in my opinion because you don't need to order thru any of the servers. The chefs were all Japanese except one and even though Yoshi, the chef who helped us, didn't look Japanese, he's from the same city my dad is from. Yoshi made our experience better because he made sure to check up on us every once in a while, while still attending to other people at the bar.   As for the other servers, some were good and some weren't. The younger ones were friendlier and had better attitudes and I learned to ask from them.   Food wise, everything comes out quick, even when you order items like takoyaki or baked mussels that are prepared in the back. This may be because we sat in front of the chef who would hand it to us but even the fried items came out quick.   The rolls are mediocre. What I like though, is that you can order a half order instead of the whole thing to avoid getting full and allowing you to try more food. Where I go in LA, they don't have that option so it;s best to go with a big group or you'll get full off 2 orders of rolls.   My absolute favorite thing about this place,though, is that dessert is included as AYCE. I don't know if it;s a Nevada thing but dessert is always a la carte at other AYCE sushi places. And the dessert is good. They have tempura ice cream, mochi, creme brulee, and sorbets. The lychee sorbet was definitely my favorite but we also tried the yuzu sorbet and the green tea creme brulee.   Overall, it was a really good experience and I wish LA had this place. Thank you Yoshi, and the three servers who were kind.",

The variety is awesome and you can eat anything you want from sushi to appetizers to dessert.    For dinner at least, there are two dishes that are limited I believe to two servings per person.  The uni (which I think is sea urchin) and the sweet shrimp, neither of which I've tried, but I've heard they are good.    They do not offer plain sashimi, and they require you to eat all the rice on your sushi else they will charge a le carte.  Not unreasonable as their sushi does taste fresh and good quality for an AYCE.  No real recommendation on which sushi to eat.  Try them all for yourself!",

Me: Sighhhhhhhhhhh, if you insist...can't believe I'm leaving off strip to get buffet.   Okay, okay, Friend, you are correct...this place is pretty delish. Worth the off strip excursion. Loved that they have half rolls (plus a good variety of rolls that doesn't just consist of Cali roll + (insert topping)) and a really interesting selection of appetizer-like food (yellowtail collar & ahi poke!). Their cuts of fish are super fresh (which is super impt for ayce sushi). Didn't pay too much attention to the ordering because my friend is a regular here (...and he doesn't even live in Vegas -____-) so I just gobbled up everything he ordered. Their dessert selection is pretty amazing (tempura ice cream, lychee sorbet, red bean + green tea ice cream, mochi!) and they don't skimp on the portion size.   Nifty that they have a stamp card (10 = 1 free buffet)! Service was great. About $30 (with tax & tip) for lunch. Easy parking.",

This place used to be a staple for my wife and me every Vegas visit, but we will never come here again.  We are disappointed that we have to find a new sushi place to come to, but this place is definitely not it anymore.  Sushi Mon changed ownership recently, and it really shows.  The cute Japanese lady is no longer at the cash register.  The new ownership charges the same price, but everything good about this place has gone.  The nigiri now comes with huge pieces of rice.  If you are a rice connoisseur, this place is for you.  It's a shame what the new management is trying to pull.  On top of that, the fish is not fresh.  My wife ordered a spicy scallop handroll, and it was overflowing with imitation crab.  I argued with the sushi chef, and he opened the handroll up and showed us the 2 pieces of scallop hidden in the bed of imitation crab.  Really??  The presentation of the salmon skin handroll looked like a kindergarten art project.    The sushi chefs are inexperienced and can't get the sauce right.  The rolls are either too salty or falling apart.",

By 12:15 it was packed, although the lunch crowd had cleared out by 1pm.  The food was great! My favorite was the Exstacy roll. I also like that they put extra sauces right on the menu, and of course they are included in AYCE. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5, is that they did not have any sashimi on the menu. Some other AYCE places will limit you to one order of sashimi per person, but I appreciate having the option. But, their fish was very fresh so we did get a couple orders of plain sushi.",

    "text": "I like the night shift chefs and servers. They served me sushi with very little rice throughout my meal. Very good cuts as well. The chef accomodated my food allergy very well. Sometimes I have to wait but the chef would always apologize and explain though I can see that they are preparing for someone else's order (which I understand). But when they are not busy, the chef always goes to my side whenever I'm almost done, to see if I want to order more. One time I ordered sake nigiri and the chef asked if I want belly (not on menu) instead. Yes pls! Very satisfied. 5 stars. Left $10 tip.   I went back for late lunch with a friend. Only got one tray of wasabi and ginger (good my friend doesn't like them so I took that 1 tray for myself). Rice was very little on my first order then they put more rice after that  (even my friend commented on the significant increase of rice on my nigiris). The cuts (small and not properly cut) are also worse on my next orders--I can tell they are skimping fish on me. The chef did not want to accomodate my food allergy so I wasn't able to get one of the sushi that I want. 1st server ignored us even when he see me looking at him(he's doing his best not to make eye contact) and the other server heard us talking about it while looking at the 1st server, 2nd server went straight to the table beside us (which was already asked by the 1st server) then she proceeded to serve other tables before we were able to make her feel pity on us. Our water wasn't filled right right away and had to flag the 3rd server to get water. 0 stars. Left $1.24 tip.  Very disappointed, I keep bragging to my friend how good I was taken care of from my prior visit. Tip: go late at night or maybe give lunch servers their tip in advance MAYBE they will take care of you. Or NOT to request anything if you're going on lunch or early dinner time if you can't go late at night. And yes, I was friendly to them until they keep ignoring us.",

We were going to get the all you can eat special but you only get an hour to eat and after looking at their menu, we thought it would be cheaper to go the a la carte route.  I got the screaming orgasm and calamari appetizers.  Both were tasty and I loved the screaming orgasm sauce.  My husband got the salmon teriyaki, which was not the best, but not bad either.  I got the chicken teriyaki and was pretty good, not the best.  But, for food value, this place rocks.  Our entrees came with miso soup, small salad, tempura, and a small california roll!! Our bill ended up being just at $40, not too shabby if you ask me.  I will definitely return.",

    "text": "I've had Sushi Mon on my radar for a long time, but since it is not anywhere near my house, nor is it around anywhere I tend to go all the time it has been collecting dust on my \"Bookmark\" shelf. Luckily lunch with a friend who works in the area happened to arise, so my reason to waste some gas to come here was justified at last!  First off we arrived right when they opened at 11:45 AM and we were not the only ones waiting. About four other parties walked in the door at the same time as us. We were seated immediately at a two-person table and we let them know we would be doing the AYCE lunch special.   I've heard really great things about Sushi Mon so I was hoping it would not disappoint. The restaurant itself is on the smallish side and decor is pretty much minimal and non-existent. Oh well, as long as the fish is good right?   I skipped appetizers and went straight into the sushi. I figured I wouldn't fill myself up on anything but fish. Our server quickly took our order.   Nigiri: Garlic Tuna Yum Yum Scallop Salmon   All were good, but my favorite was the Yum Yum Scallop. If I were to go back, this would be on the menu for a return trip.  Rolls: 1/2 J.J. Roll - Lovely roll, really enjoyed the addition of asparagus and avocado. Lemon Roll - My friend ordered this one and I had a piece, it was very fragrant and refreshing Chubby (5 pieces) - Good roll, nothing spectacular, but well put together, the soybean paper around it is a nice change.  Hand-Rolls: Per usual I ordered a spicy tuna hand roll. I always do a sushi places. This one was tasty, so I actually had two. =o^-^o=  Other: I did order the Poke bowl. It was okay, nothing special, but at least it was not overly-salted. I ended my meal with strawberry mochi ice cream - yummy! But so cold it hurt my teeth. But. That's just because I have sensitive teeth. Tee hee.  Overall:   I believe the \"hype\" is True. This place serves up GOOD, QUALITY sushi. And that is what matters when you are eating raw fish. Nothing tasted strange or wrong to me. The fish was the perfect temperature. The presentations were simple, but the rolls were made well. I would reccomened Sushi Mon and I would love to go back sometime if I am in the area.",

I tried rolls, and am happy that they office 1/2 rolls, BUT they are 5 huge pieces. I ordered 2 and couldn't even finish. The miso soup was so-so, I didn't have mine...it was scalding when it arrive and later I did not want to use up valuable space. We tried the shu-mai (terrible, should not have ordered) and chicken yakitori (it was fine) apps, but apps are a mistake if you are there for sushi and rolls. I truly wish that the AYCE places offered True half rolls or made their rolls smaller. Bigger isn't better in this case because you cant enjoy variety if you have a small stomach. I had 4 pieces left and the server explained if I left more than 2 she would have to charge me ala carte. Didn't matter, my meal (2 half rolls and yakitori) didn't even come to the 26.95 price, actually I would have saved money. But for those like me who's eyes are bigger than their stomach, beware. I understand their position, just good to know. Awesome red bean and green tea ice cream. Everything we saw coming from behind the sushi counter looked amazing, everything fresh and the temp expected. We went at 5pm, good time, not too crowded and we know this place does get crowded regularly. Nice selection and many items that don't have cream cheese (wish that had not become a thing). Anyway, recommend this place highly.",

    "text": "Everyone can argue which AYCE sushi is best in Sin City but in my sushi-venturing tenure, Mon is the best. (Note: OPINION)  This is the sister franchise of the renowned Goyemon, in which I was disappointed with in terms of service. There is practically no difference other than the infrastructure  because they serve practically the same rolls with maybe some minor differences.  Every visit I've had here, they have been on top of their service. The servers tend to lack personalities but who needs personality when you have great service? I routinely begin my rolls with the Volcano, which can take a bit longer but Mon takes a reasonable 5 minutes max as to Goyemon which took approximately 20 minutes. Why such a discrepancy? No excuse other than terrible service.  My favorites: Volcano, sexy girl, ecstasy, philadelphia, hurricane, 911(warning: very spicy hence, the name), cynthia, & stacy. All cooked to near perfection and delight. Fresh avocado, fish, rice, etc.  Some tips: - Order by half rolls unless you have a large party. I'm sure you're here to stuff yourselves but you should take advantage of the diversity of the rolls you can get with an AYCE menu. Diversity over quantity. - Make your order subsequently to receiving. Start with one roll then once it arrives, order your next so that you don't have to wait long periods of time cause sushi does take some meticulous care to make. - Chew slowly! Since sushi has rice, it has a lot of carbs. No need to be rapid since you get all you can eat cause the faster you eat, the more carbs you consume which fills up your stomach. - Get a stamp card! Whether or not you're an out of town visitor, you're destined to come back since it's so good and every 10 stamps is one free AYCE meal. They really do accumulate, especially when you come with big parties.   Don't forget to leave some room(I doubt it) for dessert! They serve green tea ice cream, mochi ice cream (strawberry & vanilla, lychee, etc.   Overall, I truly enjoy being a local here. You can never go wrong with an endless selection of sushi.",

    "text": "Having eaten my way through most of the AYCE sushi places in Vegas, I can say that some definitely shine bright (more creative rolls, better fish selection, etc), but Sushi-mon wins every time in overall value, consistency and freshness.  Admittedly, I have history here, so this review may be somewhat biased. I've been coming here since the advent of AYCE sushi in this town. Though I've ventured off to try other places, I somehow always find myself back here. It sort of has a \"Cheersish\" vibe for me.  The main reason I love it here is that I know I will get fresh, consistent product. I have never received anything less than that. At a lot of places in town, you may receive old or frozen fish which is very disconcerting. Sushi-mon somehow always has beautifully fresh fish.   In addition, they are FAST! I order something (in most cases, LOTS of things) and it's on the table in 5 minutes. Sushi-mon chefs seem to get a kick out of the people who order ridiculous amounts of food, so they send it out as quick as they can.   Speaking of the staff, they are as friendly as can be. Fransisco is my \"go-to\" server and he always takes care of us. Paul, the busser/runner, knows us well too and always keeps our drinks filled and our table clean.   But on to the food...  As I said, we usually order our fair share of nigiri: hamachi, garlic tuna, aji, hirame, hotate with yuzu...but our favorites are the hokkigai (surf clam) and sake (salmon). I've never had surf clam as fresh and delicious as theirs. If you've tried surf clam somewhere else and hated it, try it here. Trust me.  The rolls are no joke as well. Some favorites are the Yebisu, Stacey and Hurricane roll, but I've yet to try one I didn't like. Another tip: you can get most rolls in \"hand roll\" form. I like to get yumyum scallops, california and spider rolls that way. Also, try some baked green mussels. They're creamy and briny, yet sweet and unctuous. If you're still hungry after all that, get the Frying Jason roll. It's delicious, but it'll put you over the edge. Their side dishes (miso soup, tempura shrimp, sesame chicken, calamari) are terrific as well.   Ok. That's enough. This review is making me hungry. I'll see y'all there! :::insert Cheers theme song here:::",

I would only come here if I really wanted AYCE and was in the area. Though the service is very attentive and sweet.",

    "text": "I have finally returned since writing my first Yelp review.  I really love this place and really wanted the opportunity to review them.  Tonight, I finally have that opportunity.  I suggested this place to a friend of mine for some drinks and Japanese food.  I arrived at the location and to my surprise, it was empty!  No line, no waiting, no headache.  SCORE!  I chose to sit at a table of two rather than the sushi bar.  the tables are a little close from the others, however, I've learned to deal with that from my frequent past visits.  The servers are clean, wear all black and really pays attention to the need of their customers.  I appreciate them coming around often to fill up my water, or clearing any plates and debris from the table.  Makes me feel special :)  Tonight my friend got a $10 Teriyaki chicken dinner plate.  Added was my meal:  A bowl of salted edamame, an appetizer of the Yellowtail collar, a bowl of the California salad, a larger Sapporo beer and a large hot sake.   Everything mentioned above came to $52.00 with tax and ample tip.  The edamame was lightly salted and not overpowering.  It came out so warm, I was in heaven!  My favorite thing, hands down, about Sushimon is the Yellowtail or Hamachi collar.  Literally, a grilled piece of the fish collar area, close to the head.  The collar is packed with fish meat, marbleized and full of smokey flavor goodness!  This dish is served with a lemon wedge, a little fish roe and a soy-vinegar dipping sauce.  I literally take my time on this dish.  It's so good!  Every bite offers such a euphoric experience for me, I became super sad on the last bite LOL. It was the first time I've tried the California salad.  This was AH-MAZE-ING!  Start off with a spring mix accompanied with a mustard/ginger dressing.  On the top of the salad is sliced avocado, yum, shrimp and crab meat-lots of it!  It was soo filling and so fresh.  This is a must try in my book.  The crab meat was everywhere, fanned out shrimp and long slivers of avocado.  Every bite was better than the rest!    I had a great night here as I always tend to do.  Lots of great food, great service and an intimate space that allows you to really enjoy the company around you.  Definitely need to check this place out.  It's in the middle of a busy part of town and super accessible.  You will not be disappointed!!!",

At $22 (for lunch) and $25 (for dinner) I think I ate waaaay more than what was paid.  People have said the nigiri portions (fish to rice) aren't great but I thought they were fine.  I mean, I'm no sushi expert but I thought it was GREAT!    Ordered (12 people) 1. Super white tuna -my FAVORITE thing there, nice and clean flavored with the ponzu sauce that it had.  Oh so MELT in your mouth delicious.  Get it! 2. Salmon -it's always my go-to when I eat sushi.  Very soft and melt in your mouth awesome. 3. Masago w/quail egg -crunch of the masago mixed with the creaminess of the quail egg...MMMMM! 4. Uni w/quail egg (only served at dinner) -ORGASM IN YO MOUTH 5. Ikura w/quail egg -ocean flavor with that creaminess?  Yes. 6. Shrimp tempura -Filler.  It was ok but, not doing again.   7. Seared tuna -Also came with the same ponzu sauce.  It was ok, probably woody order it again. 8. Soft shell crab roll -I'm a sucker for soft shell crab.  Another must order. 9. Green tea ice cream -My palette cleanser.  Nice green tea flavor.  A must after I eat sushi. 10. Tempura ice cream -JUST.  GET.  IT.  A deep fried japanese bread holding vanilla ice, whip cream, and a cherry.  Yum!  If they drizzled chocolate syrup over it...PERFS.  There were other things ordered but these were what I mostly ate.  Service was not that bad.  Orders came out once they were ready (not like other places that come out at ONE time).  That's a plus for me.  Well...the fact that it was ALL YOU CAN EAT...made it a SUPER plus for me.  Definitely coming back.",

    "text": "Granted, I was extremely hungry when I ate here for a delayed lunch on a day full of celebrations, but this place made quite the favorable impression on yours truly.  The four of us gallant fellows all opted for the AYCE deal for maximum value. This also allowed us to pool our various orders and get the most variety while we also got the most bang for our buck. Sitting at the bar is advisable if you want to get straight to business. Obviously, lunch will deliver a better value.  The miso was a boon to us dehydrated souls. The Nigiri is all very solid. Their garlic tuna is a delicious standout, and you can't go wrong with the yellow tail. The mackerel offers that ever so distinctive fresh water taste-- may not be for everyone.  You could just as easily fill up exclusively on their specialty rolls and definitely not go wrong there. The Hurricane impressed me most of all-- so many flavors dancing on the tongue that I couldn't even describe them to you. Ecstasy roll = solid. The Flying Jason, while delicious, should be ordered with caution. It's one of the cooked rolls and contains melted cheese with a distinct, mustard like aftertaste. Great stuff but it is very filling and should probably be ordered right before dessert if at all (if you care about maximizing your value). The same goes for the Baked 428-- yummy but oh so filling.   The tempura ice cream-- I don't know how many sushi places do this but this place definitely does it RIGHT. Perhaps the most guilt ridden dessert per gram-- it is a serving of mochi covered in a doughnut like tempura crust that creates an absolutely heavenly experience (and one that can be enjoyed with chop sticks, nonetheless!) You must order this, at least once in your life.  If you are in the mood for gorging on quality sushi and don't want to shell out the cash for a place on the strip, I can promise you that Sushi Mon will lull you into a peaceful food coma.",

We were told 1 hour and really only waited 20 minutes.   AYCE sushi should warrant a wait (as in 4 laps around the parking lot before you are allowed to sit down) and sushi is prepared fresh--- no rolls sitting under fluorescent lights here!  Started with seaweed salad, which was followed by; Mingus roll Domingo roll Yebisu roll Jala Jala roll Hurricane roll Ecstasy roll Red dragon roll Pastel roll Mussels a few nigiri rolls (yellow tail, halibut) along with smelt/quail egg roll  My stomach hurt so good that I somehow managed to have a bite of strawberry mochi!!  Dinner was about $26 a person (beverage not included), well worth the wait.",

    "text": "Coworkers called to check up on me and my jacked up back (I am okay now, just sored from packing and moving and not exercising enough of late) plus to go eat at Sushi Mon (not the one on Sahara and also the closer one) and I went to meet up with them. I didn't know it was that far until I called another coworker for directions, and realized it was \"Holy Cow! I am practically starting to drive back to California\" far.  Last time I came here to eat, I just blindly followed Maryland Parkway all the way down until I reached the destination.  We arrived at 11:45am, when they opened and they already have 1/3 of the restaurant filled on a Wednesday.  Coworkers have raved about this place for a good 9 months we been working together and the food they served I have enjoyed.  And this time it was pretty good, except for the first order of sushi roll we were served (the rice tasted like it was old from last night).  But after that the rice seemed fresh like the fresh super white tuna they served us.  Tip:  Always check the specials of the day or ask the sushi chefs.  Today's Special: Super White Tuna - so good we ordered a second round, and highly recommended.  Cajun Salmon - it was alright Japanese Snapper- alright Fresh Scallop - pretty good (I don't care for the yum yum scallops the Japanese sushi places serve here in general) Yellowtail Belly - don't have it :( We also ordered the limit 1 per customer items: Uni - good Amaebi - good (but no deep fried heads) Hamachi Kama(Yellowtail collar) - good. Makes an excellent meal with just rice.  Tried the poki roll (didn't look like what we ordered last time) and the rice was not fresh. It tasted like it was from the previous night.  Spider Roll - huge and tasted great, but served with rice paper.  Rice paper usually costs $1 more, but I still like it made with the traditional nori. Pixie Roll - Another huge roll, and tasted good. Volcano Roll - Pretty good, but can be messy to eat.  But sometimes messy is a good thing when it comes to food :)  Also order: Masago with Quail Eggs - it was beautiful and I enjoyed it Tamago - The eggs are most likely ordered premade, and they just to cut it and assemble it with the rice and nori strip, but I liked it nonetheless. Fresh Water Eel - not bad  Desserts - we each picked different ones. I had the green tea ice cream, coworkers ordered the Lychee Sorbet (looks good), and Tempura Ice Cream (good).  BUT after we asked for and signed for our credit cards and the waitress came and picked stuff off of our table, I suddenly see a confused cockroach stumbling from where the soy sauce bottles and AYCE menu is.  I was in shocked and not sure where it came from, except maybe when the waitress came she might have set something down on the table, and grabbed our dessert bowls and left the unwanted hitchhiker.  Or it drop from the sky via the ventilation vent, which does NOT have a filter in place.    We waved the waitress over and she was shocked and afraid of the roach as well, but hesitantly picked up a used napkin in from the table and dropped it on top of the cockroach and picked it up off the table.  It was not the happy ending to our otherwise enjoyable meal, so -1 for that.  So 3 stars.  Good place to get sushi for those living in the South South East of Las Vegas. And they have Caked next door, which have good cupcakes, and they are on TV! (But I digressed)",

    "text": "I'm so happy that Sushi Mon is as good as I remember it from two years ago. You know how something is always better in your memory. It's $25 for all you can eat, made to order sushi. We had that for lunch and although she told us that she would probably have to hold us to the 45 minute rule (they have you cut you off after 45 minutes), we didn't feel pressured at all the entire time we were there and we were definitely still eating after 45 minutes. We probably got by with an hour and then just hung out and talked after that.   Everything was good, and what I like about this place is that you can order almost everything off the menu, they don't limit you to a certain section or items because of AYCE. You can get rolls at half the size, so you can try things you normally wouldn't order. They have a variety of different rolls, with surprisingly good combination of ingredients. The quality of fish is good, not great, but definitely slightly above average for the price.   We had all the different nigiri sushi, including the cajun albacore which I really liked. Had a little bit of kick with the ponzu flavor. The No Name rolls was pretty good, and I think we had the Athena as well. I say, just go for it, and if you don't want a roll, sometimes they can just do a handroll for you with the same ingredients. We also had a couple of yellowtail collars, edamame, a cucumber salad, and to top it off, we had lychee sorbet (super yummy with lychee jelly mixed in), and tempura ice cream which was made with vanilla ice cream. It was coated in what looked to be pound cake and then deep fried. Or attempted to be deep fried. Either way, I would not get it again.   Service was great, and they carefully explained everything and happily took our order. They never made us feel like we could only order the cheaper items because of the AYCE, and service was great throughout. I hope to come back on a future trip to Vegas.",

The place wasnt even packed.   We were averaging about 3 times a week coming here so we asked to order food to go. In the order all we wanted  changed was instead of regular Salads we wanted cucomber salads. The waitrsses ALWAYS do it for Us with a small upcharge of $3. When the manager rang us up, He tried charging us a extra $30!! We are not cheap what so ever, but the size of the salads can fit into the palm of 1 hand. We kindly explain to him that we never Get charged that much. His answer \"no your lieing, we never do that!\" I told our friends \"f*ck this the food isn't worth this rude prick! & DEFINitly let's take our $$ elsewhere\"  No where is food good Enough for anyone to put up with DISRESPECTFUL people. My bf is a huge guy, this mother f**ker is so lucky he didn't pick up one of the bar stools and hit him over The head with it. WE WILL NEVER RETURN AGAIN.   If your looking for a AMAZING sushi spot where the cooks drink with you & are tons of fun go to SUMO SUSHI off warm springs & durango. They play all the top 40 hits & great hip hop :) they are never rude & the 25 min drive from our house is completely worth it :)",

    "text": "It saddens me to give this joint 3 stars because this was my favorite AYCE spot in town. They offer an AYCE menu, which is $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner, but you can also opt for a la carte sushi. Prices vary for a la carte depending on what your order. Just remember, if you do a la carte, you're not allowed to share with an AYCE patron in your party. If you're hungry and want everything and anything on the menu, AYCE is the way to go.   Throughout the years, their quality and flavors have gone down. Their service is a hit or miss depending on the time you come in. I live down the street so this was our spot to go to. On our last visit however, things were lacking.  The seaweed salad has gotten really watery and salty. This is usually my favorite appetizer to order, but this time it was hard to eat. The garlic edamame was awful. They overcooked the garlic and now our edamame was just bitter. My bf ordered the tiger roll and his reaction to the presentation was \"it's not made with love anymore.\" The avocado looked like it had been smeared over the top of the roll instead of cut nicely and placed on top. And it was an overkill with the imitation crab inside. Same thing with the lemon roll. Really sloppy presentation and too much imitation crab. The nigiri we ordered was really good though. Not too much rice and the fish was nice and plump. And I love their yellowtail collar. If it's on the specials menu, order one!! It's tender, moist and grilled to perfection.   All in all, this isn't a bad sushi joint. I'm just hoping that we just dined in on an off night because I really do like this spot.",

The taste was ok, but definitely not the teriyaki I would eat again. My bf had some sashimi and another role and the fish was definitely not fresh. My lunch experience was ok overall and I think I would skip this place if I have a craving for some Japanese food.",

We also ordered on the side the fried gyoza and the seaweed salad, and mango mochi and green tea ice cream for dessert. Gyoza was good, seaweed salad was sub par, mango mochi was delicious, and the green tea ice cream had chunks of ice cubes in it. Not good.  The service and cleanliness, but especially service is what knocks it down several pegs for me. My mom and I got off work together and when we sat down at the bar tonight we could barely hear the server over the music/loudness. And a couple of customers came in after us and sat down near us and seemed to be friends with the sushi chef and started chatting away. Not only did they get served their appetizer and their ginger and wasabi first but they got their drinks with their water. I ordered a drink I didn't even get, luckily wasn't charged for it. The counter where we were sitting hasn't really been wiped off it was still dirty and grungy from the previous diners.   Seemed like the sushi chef was angry with me specifically because I asked the server to get us some wasabi and ginger. He didn't want to make eye contact and only spoke to my mom when he did speak to us. Which was only twice the entire meal. The other chefs smiled and were doing their things, but ours was clearly enjoying himself entertaining his friends. Disappointing since I am a big sushi fan and I just moved to Vegas and I've been asking for recommendations. This was one of them. I'll likely not be back.",

It's not close to the strip but worth the drive, trust me. It's a long list of choices for their rolls and sushi, actually quite a bit of reading. And allllll so yummyyyy! I wish there was one near home :(   It's better if you sit at the bar for the all you can eat. Cause you can order for sushi right there instead of bugging the waitresses that are serving others.

    "text": "I love this place. This is a must-go restaurant in Vegas. They open till 2 am everyday so if you are hungry after all-night's partying and feeling like some Japanese food, go to Sushi Mon. It is an all-you-can-eat sushi bar that also serves other Japanese delights, such as tempura shrimp, teriyaki, gyoza, noodle, and tempura ice cream. What? You don't know what tempura ice cream is? shame. It's deep-fried ice cream Japanese style! Super yummy! Everything there is fresh and made to order. I prefer sitting at the counter because I can just tell the chef what I want and they will make them right away. If I feel like some hot food or soup, I can tell any waitress to bring them out and they have fast service too.",

(which is always a positive when eating sushi)  Ask for Fredo!!!  Lots of rolls to choose from, as well as sushi choices, and they don't use too much rice to fill you up!  Fredo suggested the salmon collar (which im surprised that ive never had before, being that we eat sushi about 1 to 2 times a week) it was delicious.. try it!! :)   and ask for Fredo.. he's from Hawaii and makes some awesome sushi and is just an all around great, funny guy!!!   Also, you get apps and dessert included in your AYCE price, that is if you still have room for dessert after all the sushi you consume...  Dont forget to ask for a punch card, (and Fredo, hey im just trying to give you a great experience here) once you get 10 punches you get a free all you can eat!!!! well WoRtH IT!!!!  Open late..... and Fredo is there Tuesday thru Saturday, 4pm till close.....  Its hit or miss as to it being busy, you can get right in or there could be an 30 min to 1 hour wait.. so cross your fingers you go at the right time!  For all you can eat, you cant beat it with a stick!!",

The quality of the fish blows my mind--am I seriously eating this in the middle of the desert?!  the increasing prices make me apprehensive, and worried.  For this little restaurant, there are way too many servers, which might be why the price keeps going up. Make sure you eat all your food (or try to at least be incognito in your method of disposing your rice) because they will charge you ala carte prices if not.  **Order half portions if you think you cannot handle! My faves:  Nigiri - Uni, hamachi, salmon Special rolls - Athena (spicy hamachi, cucumber & avocado wrapped in shrimp), No Name (spicy tuna & asparagus, wrapped in hamachi), Dragon (California roll wrapped in unagi w/ unagi sauce drizzle) Sides - Grilled hamachi collar, dynamite!, baked mussels, ahi poki (reminiscent of Hawaii) And my all-time favorite... Quail egg shooter.  A shot glass filled with hot sauces, quail egg, and tobiko (fish eggs).  Mmm! Try to get out of your element and try new things here at Sushi mon, because if you do this at another restaurant you will have to pay per plate.",

So from now on, when I put something at five stars you know it'll be super mind-blowing!  Anyways I digress.    Lunch and dinner prices went up a few bucks, to maybe $25 and $28.  We sat at the sushi bar this time, but didn't have good service from the chef - then again, they're probably used to people barking huge lists of food to them all day long instead of making small talk.

This is all you can eat but its not a buffet, serve yourself type. People are leaving $1 or $2 tips for meals they paid over $24 for. Then, the waitress has to run back and forth many times for you and give you all you want. Then, people stiff them for only a dollar or two. If you're getting poor service that's fine but almost everyone that rated them, loved the food and the service! Please take care of your servers, if you haven't noticed good ones are hard to find! The lunch waitresses are much better than the night ones but remember there's only 2 of them serving the whole restaurant and no cashier to help them. I know most customers are college kids and probably don't care but remember these waitresses only get minimum wage so with anyone in a restaurant the tips help them the most. Someday you may work a minimum wage job and see what I'm talking about!",

We heard it's better to pay for all-you-can-eat lunch($21.95), which was really a bad start. We had about 10 sushi rolls there, then they(chefs waiters) pretend didn't see us at all. Foods showed up really slow and rice tasted kinda bad enough(hard and not stick together). Anyway, just save your hard earned money(gasoline $$ & $21.95 lunch or $26.95 dinner after 4pm), because there are tons of Japanese restaurant for just sushi rolls or sashimi in LA. Btw, they don't even desired tips($10) or a star from us. So I  highly don't recommended this place in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Okay, usually I associate AYCE Sushi with mediocre, fast-food, Americanized Japanese eats simply because 19 out of 20 times it is.  Then, there is Sushi Mon, the 1 in 20 where it is not!  First of all, the well staffed chefs and servers are exceptionally considerate to the patrons. When I say \"exceptionally considerate\", I don't mean in the over-the-top annoying manner either. There is a genuine warmness in the staff, even in the \"welcome-to-this-sushi-bar-we-have-to-greet-everyone-who-walks-in-the-door-so-here-I-am-giving-you-this-greating-for-the-seventy-third-time-today\" welcome. What pleased me even more is the fact that everyone seemed to be pleased with their coworkers and appeared to enjoy EVERY aspect and tasks of their jobs (I might even seek part-time employment here, well maybe not... but I'll keep that idea in my memory bank). Sushi Chef, Hiro, was awesome! He made my wife and I's 8th wedding anniversary exceptional.  The whole experience was first class. It was if we were at dinner with old friends we hadn't seen in a while and had a chance to catch-up with each other's families.   Oh yeah, I almost forgot...we ate food here as well. love the fact that you can order 1/2 rolls which made the sampling of their variety enjoyable. Hiro was very good at explaining each dish and offered great suggestions. Besides the normal rolls we ordered he had us try the Green Mussels. I was hesitant with the Mussels but was so glad I did. And the offering of the Fatty Tuna was well called. Hiro was correct in his description of melt in your mouth buttery taste on that one. The two daily special rolls, Hurricane and Ecstasy were scrumptious. I think my favorite however was the Domingo.  The menu items we ordered were perfectly cooked.  Their gyoza comes steamed or fried.  I'm a fried guy but ordered steamed on a whim. Order the Gyoza and order it steamed. The flavor is very kind to your momma! I can say more but, I want to leave some of the experience up to you.",

You can tell by examining the cuts of salmon -- Sushi Mon's salmon is some of the best I've had.  If you're not w/ a big group, I would suggest sitting at the bar b/c you can request orders directly to the sushi chef w/o having to tell the waiters/waitresses.  Sushi Mon has the special rolls, but I love the plain sashimi on nigiri rice rolls.  You have to try the salmon, tuna, and surf clam.  A specialty this restaurant has that no other place has is the sea urchin and sweet shrimp on rice.  These are only served at dinner and you can only order one order per person per all you can eat check.  It's sooooo good mainly b/c the cuts are so fresh.  If you are a newbie to Sushi Mon, please come at dinner time to request the sea urchin and sweet shrimp -- you will not regret it.  Another dish I recommend is the baked mussels -- phenomenal.  You have to try this!!!!",

It was late after work and we decided we wanted something light, so we finally went to sushimon. We were really tempted to do the AYCE because they were running a lot of specials that night. But instead we got the tempura udon, s.s. dinner (with 12 pieces of sashimi), and a japanese lasgna. The dinner came with 3 pieces of tuna, hamachi belly, salmon, and red snapper, two salads, miso soup, and bowl of rice all for $13.99!! I think if you made your own nigiri with the rice and sashimi it would've been worth more then that price. Overall, we left stuffed and finally proved to my bf that we can leave sushimon with our bellies full and satisfied!!!",

The place is always packed, that should tel you something, but if you go early you can usually get in pretty fast. The appetizer menu has a ton of items and with the all you can eat you get appetizers and desert. Last time we went in they had taken the Mochi ice cream off the all you can eat but go ahead and splurge to get it, it is awesome!",

They have all you can eat sushi, but the awesome part is, it is NOT BUFFET style. They make it upon order, so the rolls always come out hot and fresh. The tempura is actually still crispy when they serve it! It's quite a drive from the Strip and at night, I don't even know if you can get a cab to go down there to pick you up and bring you back to the Strip.",

    "text": "Hands down the best AYCE sushi experience anywhere.  I wish i can say i have joked about making the trek from Los Angeles out to LV just for this sushi but it has happened!  We always have to visit Sushi Mon whenever Vegas happens.  This is not cheap, poor quality, limited option, endless up-charge sushi either. It is impossible to try everything here even on multiple visits since they always have new offerings. Your options are close to 100 and include hot items like baked mussels and gyoza and desserts like mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream.  You can order half rolls too so you can try more of a variety.  I have never seen fresh scallops, sweet shrimp, uni, halibut, and sometimes toro all  on a AYCE menu.  The best part of it all is lunch is about $27 with tax/tip and dinner is just a few bucks more!  I am sure we easily would pay double since they amount of food and the quality is on par with $100 sushi experience at any of my normal spots in the South Bay.  On top of this they give you a punch card so after 10 AYCEs you get one for free!  BONUS!!! So yes it is worth the trip, the gas, and the experience!",

The sushi chef welcome us with open arms and explained everything to us about the \"All You Can Eat\" Sushi menu and let us order one roll at a time to ensure we would be getting the best \"bang for our buck.\" We didn't need the AYCE menu, though -- if I ate more than three bites without getting full, it would be an amazing deal.   We got the takoyaki, spicy tuna hand rolls, and octopus salad. The octopus salad was absolutely delicious. The takoyaki was a little much for me. The spicy tuna hand rolls just weren't what I was used to, but the fish was extremely fresh. The food I ordered wasn't my favorite, but I think that was more my error than anything. The man next to me was ordering the most amazing food and I wish we would have just tagged along with him. If I could go back, I would have definitely ordered the salmon collar. It looks beautiful! The lychee sorbet made my heart smile as did the service.   I would be happy to try this place again! Their prices are definitely fair and their food is good!",

There is a ton of variety but I like to stick to my core rolls and with All You Can Eat being $25 bucks you can get a lot.  The weekends are super busy but here's my little trick. Run over to the PT's bar across the parking lot and just call in your reservation. By the time they call your phone you'll be 2-3 beers deep and ready to put some spicy tuna inside you.  Oh and ask for the Hulk Roll, it's crazy good. Don't ask for the Shewchuk Roll... they might boot you out of there.",

    "text": "I absolutely adore sushi.  And no, I'm not snooty about my sushi.  I like nigiri along with sushi rolls.  If that makes me any less legit, so be it.  I love any roll with shrimp tempura and unagi sauce on it.    Anyway, my friend told me about this place and it's an all you can eat (AYCE) sushi place.  (I only clarify AYCE because when I was reading reviews it took me a good half hour to figure out what it meant) So the bf and I went to get our sushi on and we were not disappointed.  You have an hour to eat all the sushi you can and trust me, it's enough.  We were seated at the sushi bar, always a good place to be, and we gave our orders directly to the head sushi chef. You can order any nigiri, rolls, they have specials on the walls, as well as anything from chicken teriyaki to shrimp tempura on their side menu.  I didn't wanna waste any time on anything but the sushi though.  One of the things I LOVE is that you can order half rolls, which was great because that way you can try more things without getting ridiculously full.  So my boyfriend and I dove in ordering some toro, sweet shrimp, yellowtail, and albacore.  It was all good.  I know you worry that all you can eat = poor quality, but that is not the case here.  They have great cuts of fish along with yummy rice.  Then we started experimenting with the rolls.    I ate to the point where I almost needed to throw up.  I considered going to the bathroom and throwing up just so I could eat more. Then I resolved not to be bulimic and came back to the bar where my boyfriend was a trooper and managed to order dessert.    I have to say, if I had only 1 meal in Vegas, I would spend it here.  I wish they had a sushi mon in LA, I'd probably get mercury poisoning from going everyday.",

Well when another group of two came we all said we would share that table and they still wouldn't give it to us. So we waited but not too long.  The service was good as came by frequently and kept drinks full but not very friendly just there to do their job it seemed.   The roll options are good but not great. I like spicy options but try to stay away from tempura. Not many choices without tempura and without yum yum sauce. No options without rice.  Shared the pixie and the sexy girl were good though and the chubby was the first time I tried eel and it wasn't overwhelming and it was good. We got two others I can't remember the names, maybe the sunrise was one and i didn't like the spice of the garlic sauce.  Good but not great as there are other places in town I would rather venture further for to have more options.",

Also, there's a good variety on the all you can eat menu, more than most Japanese restaurants  --including different appetizers, desserts, fancier rolls and other special items like kobe beef, sweet shrimp and uni.

That's a big win in my book.  Everything we got was super tasty and good quality. Nice fresh fish. A good fish to rice ratio. The ayce menu has a terrific variety.

I wasn't thrilled about the hurricane roll, but it was alright. Their fish is super fresh, the garlic tuna, super white, salmon, and Uni are my favorite! Fish to rice portion is perfect. Not too much rice, and the cut of the fish is not too thick. It's just like your average sushi bar, but you can count on their fish being fresh EVERYTIME. Service is friendly, chefs work at a fast pace. And you can do half rolls! You can't go wrong here!",

The rolls come in half orders just tell the sushi chef. Overall it was a pleasant and refreshing experience to dine here.",

Which by the way, when we told the manager there was a roach, they quickly told us that it was a spider. Hmm. Roach.. Spider.. Roach? Two totally different things. But anyway, that's in the past. I have gone back a few times since then because the sushi is delicious. Many times I've gone while it was slow so the service was great. Oh but today, today someone had a case of the Mondays.  I was seated at the bar and at first, the service was great. The servers came by, checked on us, refilled drinks.. And of course the food was amazing. Then, came time for dessert. I tried flagging down any server passing by, one did look my way but kept walking. Okayyy.. I even went to the extreme of flailing my arms in the air and still, nothing. Finally, someone came over. I mentioned how we were forgotten and waiting for awhile. His response, \"so what can I get for you?\" Well. For damned sure you're going to get me my order cause I'm telling you to. But really? No acknowledgment of my comment, no apology, nothing. It's so sad because Sushimon's food is so good but their service leaves such a bad taste in your mouth.",

There's almost always a wait here, so be prepared to build your hunger even further for 30-60 minutes. Once seated though the food comes pretty quickly. I get mostly nigiri, the Super white is my favorite! The uni wasn't really good here and there was way too much rice on this one. You can order 1/2 rolls for my variety. The crispy rice is really good. Tempura ice cream FTW, I wish I could have different flavors (like green tea), but the tempura only comes in vanilla. I just order a green tea ice cream on the side and mix them!",

We had to wait 15 minutes to sit anywhere and there were empty tables they would not let us sit at because they said there were other people on the list that we're going to be seated there. For a party of 2, waiting for that long to then finally be sat at the bar where I originally asked to be seated at was annoying.  Best part: sushi is awesome and the garlic edamame is delicious. You can get half rolls which is nice for all you can eat. Bad part: long wait, hostess service sucks, waitress was ok and made it very clear we had to eat all of our sushi or we would be charged extra. There are so many rules and I was scared that if I didn't eat every single grain of my rice they would charge me.  Honestly I prefer other places that are more lenient and don't stalk your leftovers.",

As far as refills you have you be even more aggressive, otherwise you will die of thirst.    Employees here do not care for customer service. They are not attentive to your needs. This company will not get anymore business from me or anyone I speak to. I do not recommend this place.

Blended with spicy garlic sauce and eel sauce.  For the nigiri, we had the yellow tail, salmon, and tuna rolls. My favorite was the salmon nigiri. We followed things up with the cajun albacore. Loved the unique cajun seasoning on the albacore. Brings out a new flavor to sushi.  Other Orders...  Volcano roll came out nice and warm with quite interesting flavors. Overall, pretty okay. Scallop yum yum roll with orgasm sauce was the best! Pixie roll contained crab, shrimp, cucumber, avocado, smelt eggs, and eel sauce all wrapped in soy paper. An unusually large roll. Also an unfavorable ending to my stomach considering the amount of sushi we already had.   Finished things off with a tempura ice cream. Unfortunately, it was a bit disappointing. The tempura was just too soft and soggy.",

I came here with my friend that lives in the area and I'm so glad she suggested to come here. I've been here twice and the sushi was super fresh and the quality so far has been consistently good. It's only $26.95/per person. What a great price. The staff is friendly, but not really the most attentive. At times we were flagging down the waitress to put in more orders. Maybe my friend and I were getting out of control because it felt as if we were constantly ready for our next order. I love this place and I'm in haven every time I come here.",

I always get AYCE because I can't get enough of the sushi and end up leaving with a food baby. I love the miso soup to start me off and ending my mass consumption with tempura ice cream. It is hard for me to say there is one thing that is my favorite here. The only down fall is usually there is a wait before you are seated as it is so popular. But I am more than happy to wait with food this amazing.",

YUMMMMMM!!!! definitely worth the 5 stars for fresh sushi and great tasting japanese food! The slightly bad part is NO RESERVATIONS, but you can get away with it if you come like an hour or two earlier than your \"reservation\" time, tell the hostess how many people are going to come, then it should cut on the wait time..never come last minute with a large group, thats just silly -- of course a great restaurant is going to be busy. and sadly sushi-mon is not a very large restaurant, so theres limited dining space. Okay, onto the food -- definitely get ahi poki, steamed gyoza, sushi rolls (it depends on your style, but avg people - if you want to try more rolls, ONLY ORDER HALF ROLLS instead of FULL ROLLS because you are required to eat everything you have...save your stomach and be smart). 9-1-1 roll was not very good, I warned you - but now you probably want to try it for yourself...lastly, save room for dessert, because i love green tea icecream and strawberry mochi! :)",

And you only get 60 minutes to eat.  Are you kidding me?  I'm small but I can eat more than average girls.  I tried it a while ago and it didn't leave any impression so I tried it again and still nothing special.  Order 1/2 order so you can try the other rolls.  I like their grilled yellowtail collar and one other roll (incredible hulk roll??)  Their seared albacore, unagi and shrimp tempura were not bad.  Other than that........just average.  Don't get the uni..trust me..$27.99 for dinner (60 min).  Lunch is cheaper but you only get 45 minutes.  Service was great except for the cranky male host.  He was rude and he grabbed the menu from my hand when I was looking at it before I was seated.   \"Am I not supposed to see the menu?\"  He said \"yes you can see the menu\" Maybe he's having a bad day?",

    "text": "my friend absolutely love this place, so i thought i would try it out. I've been to the one on the sahara already, so I kind of expected the same, but it was worse.    I was with a group of people so i was waiting about 50 min to be seated, and i'm not complaining about that. Everybody in my table got all you can it, and i didn't. so for those who look for a lot of rolls and appetizer it might be a good deal for about $30 per person.  They weren't picky about having everyone to get all you can it and such so that was cool, but i didn't find our waitress very friendly, and how they just sort of threw the plates on the table over my head to set the food down. I mean its not a big deal but i really wasn't feeling very comfortable to even take bites from my food.  I got Chirashi, its sort of like terriyaki bowl, but instead of chicken i get variety of fish, cut in sashimi style.  it was $13 if i remember correctly and i got a soup and a salad with it.  the quality of the fish wasn't very impressive at all, some of the fish actually seemed very dry in my mouth.  They also threw some pickled mushrooms, and radishes, and a LOT of ginger and wasabi to cover the rice.  It was nicely decorated plate, but i really  didn't like how my fishes weren't fresh.  I also looked over at my friends food, they were huge rolls in many defferent colors, mostly deepfried and cream cheese.  I can see why it could be a cool spot since you can order half of things and try all defferent things, but it just didn't do it for me.  I didn't find my friends plates very appetizing, although it might of tasted good, a lot of the rolls were very similar to one another. I guess next time i should try the all you can eat if i get dragged into that place again.  I've had better experience at different all you can it place in california, but from what i hear its the best all you can eat in las vegas, and i think thats very questionable. although the one on sahara was 3 stars.",

    "text": "Been to both Sushi Mons, I have to say I like the one on w Sahara much better than this one........... I went with 2 friends on a Friday afternoon trying to have a quick lunch, we all had AYCE option, we didn't have to wait but the restaurant was pretty full so we were seated at the bar. The waitress wanted us to order directly from the chef, there are 2 of them inside the bar but they were always so busy it's hard to order from them, there were only 2 of them, a lot of times we ordered 2 order on one item,but it only came out with one, and you can't order more than 3 items with different quantities 'cause he will mess up 100%, also you have to pretty much be yelling at the chef to make orders because he is so busy and far a way. The quick lunch took us 2 and half hours, about more than 2 hours of that time we had nothing to eat and nothing to do but staring at the busy chef........ The ratio of meat to rice is also not as good as the Sushi Mon on W Sahara, with more rice and less meat.  The only thing better about this location is the menu is larger , with a lot more selections and special rolls,,,Oh, the mochi is delicious, but you get the same thing elsewhere. My friend asked the server several times for more ginger, but no, the server kept forgetting, so I just gave my ginger to my friend since I don't like it that much..... I say they need more cooks and servers if they are so busy .....",

Lots of young people for the most part and some hoochie mamas came in wearing those tight slinky dresses, no other comment other than \"what the hec?\". We both had the All you can eat and for some reason the waitress kept asking if we would like 1/2 orders, not sure what that was all about, but we declined and got full rolls. Overall pretty good, but I was kind of suspicious when it took just a few minutes for our rolls to arrive. I know there is a whole lot of Sushi guys behind the counter, but how could several rolls with different ingredients come out in a matter of minutes? Pre-made? Say it ain't so! I can't confirm this, but it was kind of odd in all my years of eating Sushi. Some rolls were kind of oversized and you couldn't eat it in a single bite. We had a Spider roll that was softshelll crab on the ends, but the middles seemed to be unrecognizable and oversized. I really like UNI but seems it isn't a popular item and many places are usually out of it. Sushi Mon had it, but the flavor was just a bit off, maybe out of season? I don't know but other Sushi Bars never get UNI as good as it should be. Overall good value for the price. Didn't really have a roll that stood out above the rest and my next visit will be just random ordering since none of the rolls were truly memorable, but still a good effort and we'll be back again for sure.",

(Too bad no sashimi in the all you can eat menu)  I've been there a few times now over the last couple years.  You are allowed one order of sweat shrimp and sea urchin nigiri per person.  The nigiri pieces are smaller than typical, but since it's all you can eat, you can actually try more variety this way.  The rice to fish portion is reasonable, although just a tag more than I would like and they do require that you eat the rice as well.  But I usually leave small amount of scattered rice pieces here and there and they never said anything.  The quality of fish is suprisingly fresh for an all you can eat place, but of course not as good as the pricier sushi restaurant.  They also have some good rolls there.  It also include dessert so that's nice.  I haven't tried any other of the similar all you can eat sushi place in the vegas area, so I'm not sure how it compares.  I just know I wish there's a place like this near where I live.",

Can you imagine how long a dragon roll is if there's only four pieces?  We didn't even ask for half orders but all their servings were really small.  We asked for vegetable tempura and it didn't come with yams!  What is a vegetable tempura without yams?  Not to mention the tempura they made was not crunchy, it was soggy.  Same thing with the most anticipated calamari that I wanted to eat.  We expected the food to be fresh.  The raw tuna and salmon there was not fresh, even the avacado had to taste fishy.  I think I will stick with the other sushimon on Sahara in Las Vegas (at least their surrounding looked better).  The only thing that I felt that tasted good was the fried shumai.  But to sushi mon....., if you can only make good fried shumai for your buffet, I rather go elsewhere considering how much i pay for your buffet.",

For past 3 years, they started to decline in their taste and the quality of the sushi. Last visit I had a week ago, the food was terrible and they confused my name with another person's name on the waiting list. So my family had to wait another extra 35 min with an initial hour wait. The manager was extremely impolite and hesitant to apologize. Sushi Mon is not the same as it was years ago. I won't come here anymore. It's time to find a new AYCE sushi in Vegas.",

    "text": "Based on the reviews here, hubby and I decided to pop by on a Sat night.  Although it was packed, we didn't have a wait because there was only two of us and we sat at the sushi bar.  My thoughts:  --the Maryland location is small-ish, so you're in close quarters with everyone.  -- it had a bit of a fishy smell, more so than other sushi joints. I chalked it up to the close quarters of place.  --they were flexible with the AYCE option. At first, we weren't sure whether we wanted to do AYCE. Sometimes it makes more sense, especially if you want to try lots of different rolls.  But you gotta be ready for AYCE, i.e., have some drawstring sweatpants on.  As we debated, the chef advised us that he would tally the amount once we were done, and charge us whatever was less, whether that be itemizing the rolls or the AYCE price. Awesome!!!  --one of the best things I loved is that they let you order half orders of most rolls. This is really great when there's only two people eating. My husband and I have different tastes, so it can be challenging to eat multiple rolls by myself. But we love trying lots of different rolls. Ordering half rolls was a great option for us.  --that being said, I didn't l-o-v-e the rolls. Don't get me wrong -- it was good but I just didn't think it was *great.* Some of the rolls we had were kinda bland. Maybe it was just an off-night we went. I think I'm willing to give it a try again ;-)",

The restaurant was not too big but we came for lunch on Sunday so we didn't have to wait, I heard it gets crowded at peak times. My favorite are definitely all the nigiri and they don't give you a huge piece of rice as filler. There are a couple of high end more expensive items on the menu that you can only have one order per person. I say take full advantage and order it all because they were all very delicious; Uni, sweet shrimp, cajun salmon, amberjack, and yellowtail collar.   We stuffed our face and proud of it. All you can ask for in Sushi are freshness and variety and SushiMon satisfy both. Only downside, it is located about 20min drive from the main strip and if you do not have a car, it's not worth it to taxi out there.",

Lychee Sherbet is a must try ( finally! I found it at Nijiya <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/nijiya-market-san-jose#hrid:E43VdZqPGTwG0IyS1xDVtQ\">yelp.com/biz/nijiya-mark...</a>) 4. Open late until 2 a.m.  They have a good variety of rolls and everything is pretty fresh.  The place is always full with a line out the door and a waiting list so you know it's good! The specialty rolls are great, and I recommend the Pixie, Mingus, and the Spider.  Just wish their poki salad was a tad less salty.  I can't eat as much as I used to but want to get my money's worth.",

We ordered something fresh to start so we had a half of a cucumber roll, the sushi chef  kind of laughed and rolled his eyes. I brushed it off. Then we ordered a few more and we never got the ones we ordered and he gave us things that we didn't order. He rolled his eyes was rude and made me feel like I was inconveniencing him to make my food. That's what you are there for to make my food! Even the party next to us noticed that he was not nice to us. He is an older Asian man with glasses. His tip jar was empty when we came in and it stayed that way the hour we were there. I at one point even asked a waiter if we could order rolls with him because of the total negative attitude that we got from our chef. The food was decent but I would not return because of how I was treated.",

I don't know about anyone else, but unless the sushi quality is top notch and the dining experience comes with the 360 degree service and quality, I absolutely refuse to pay $25-$28 for all you can eat when I know I can get it for at/under $23 elsewhere where I don't have to wait 20/30 minutes to be sat.   While their sushi and plates are interesting, I honestly don't see anything overly special about this place. Small, always seems to be mobbed, and while the service is good, it is nothing overly outstanding like some of my friends raved to me about.  The reason why I gave it three stars is because 1.) The prices are a little over the top for something you can get cheaper (and in a better setting) somewhere else, and 2.) This place is always busy, and the wait times are very much over-quoted and long.",

Honestly, I was really disappointed. The tables are almost stacked on top of each other when you are seated. I could have rubbed elbows with the table next to me. The fish was not fresh when I was there, which was a big bummer. I'm not sure why everyone is raving about the menu selection, because this place had the smallest selection of the 4 I have been to. They are quick to get the rolls out to you, but quick isn't always good. The quality definitely wasn't there. I think most people like this place because it's convenient, but outside of that you should go elsewhere.",

Apparently they have managed to use quality fresh fish at low prices to their advantage and hence the place is packed.  As good as I have had for \"All Ye Can Scarf\" Sushi.  This is definitely all about the All You Can Eat vice the a la carte items.  Just be prepared that if you go during typical dinner-evening rush hour times you might wait a bit.  If you are on a tight time-line you should think twice about coming.  For the price of what you get, it is top value in the sushi world.  I was almost expecting mediocore food due to the amount of people and the constant, intense, back-and-forth sushi retrieval operations going on.  However, for the volume and low price, they maintained a decent presentation and didn't do a hatchet job on the sushi/sashimi.  If you wanna binge on sushi of good quality without getting schwacked in the wallet, you can't beat this place.",

To be perfectly honest, I have very mixed feelings about it.  It's a small space and seemingly always busy, but we were lucky and got two spots right away at the sushi bar.  Our sushi chef was quick and friendly, and the fish he served us  was beautifully cut and arranged.  We started off with a bunch of orders of nigiri: tuna, salmon, super white tuna, albacore, yellow tail, snapper, all of which were fresh and delicious.  I really wanted a roll with soft shell crab but they only had 2. I ordered the Spider Roll and I was sorely disappointed.  It was huge, but full of the imitation crab meat and a lot of rice and barely any soft shell crab inside.  Of course, I had to eat it all anyway since AYCE.    Our sushi chef left to go on break so another chef took over. We went back to ordering nigiri and the pieces he served were comical. One small, one big, one cut in half in the middle...really, as a sushi chef, he should have been embarrassed to be putting out pieces like this.  The rest of our meal proceeded in this fashion, with very tiny ugly looking pieces of fish.  I know I know, it all tastes the same, but sorry, I expect my sushi to look pretty, too. Our last dish was the dynamite, which took forever and it was overcooked so the scallops were a little tough.    We ended our meal with delicious mochi in mango, strawberry and vanilla flavors.  I would say that overall the service was great and the food was good.  Not my favorite sushi joint, but I'd go back because I like the atmosphere and it's close to my house.",

    "text": "$21.95 for AYCE lunch means that my friends and I get our money's worth whenever we eat here.  I usually dine with my pals after we do a long ride or run in the area, so we come ready to eat.  This was the case again this past Saturday when we arrived a few minutes before the doors opened at 11:45am.  There were a few other people waiting, too, but our party of six had no problem snagging a table, so come early and you won't have to wait, either. I can only eat shellfish, so my sushi choices are very limited, but I like the appetizers, too.  This equates to a not very healthy meal, but you gotta live a little. My usuals:  miso soup, shrimp and vegetable tempura, shumai, cucumber salad, shrimp tempura roll, 007 roll, Dynamite roll, Moment roll, with red bean ice cream or strawberry mochi for dessert. The service is always attentive and the food just keeps coming.  For the amount of food that we can put away when we're hungry, Sushi Mon is a bargain.    *Review #200 for 2013--yay.",

They also have an amazing sashimi salad! You have to try it next time you visit!   Oh! and they serve half rolls! I have visited numerous sushi restaurants and if they don't serve half rolls, I will definitely not go back! I like enjoying a great variety of flavors and textures which is hard to attain if you're eating 8 rolls of the same thing... And hopefully those 8 rolls are good. That's what keeps me coming back to them!",

    "text": "One word: SUSHIGASM.  Okay okay....so it's not a real word.  Before I go on with my review, I have to say I was a bit weary dining here.  My last experience of AYCE sushi was HORRIBLE.  I never felt so sick in my life and had to hang out in the bathroom for the rest of the night. Yeah, you can say I was scarred from AYCE joints from that experience.    With that said, my brother told me he loves this place and takes all his visitors here for dinner.  My brother has a waaaaay more sensitive stomach than I do. If he loves this place and doesn't get sick from it, then I'm sure I can tolerate it.    $28 is not a bad deal for AYCE sushi.  Originally I thought this place was going to be buffet-style but get this: they make it fresh for you once you put in your order! Ummm how great is that??  So I felt a lot better once I found that out.  I tried to sample a variety of dishes served at Sushi Mon.  Between my brother, his fiancee and I, this is what I remember ordering:  Seared salmon nigiri Every time I dine at a kaiten restaurant, I always order a few plates of this.  I thought it was interesting how they presented this dish because they sear the underside of the salmon.  And yes, I thought the the texture and taste was good.  Garlic tuna nigiri The only other place I can compare this to is Genki Sushi and Sushi Mon does it a lot better.  I like how there's enough garlic to compliment the taste of the tuna, rather than overwhelm it.    Ecstasy Roll This roll contains chopped albacore, avocado and tempura crumb wrapped with tuna, smelt eggs & seaweed salad drizzled with orgasm sauce. Yeah, you heard that right, orgasm sauce.  I dunno what orgasm sauce is (or if I wanna know) but that with the entire roll was delicious.  I liked the texture the tempura crumbs added to the roll as well.  Supreme Salmon roll Salmon wrapped with rice, nori and...more salmon!? This was an instant hit with me but I had to deduct a half star because I found a fish bone in one of the rolls.  Baked mussels These were pretty good, although I thought there was a little too much mayo and cheese topping it.  Sushi Mon Lasagna To clarify, this contains scallop yum and cucumber spread with yum yum sauce & cream cheese.  All I can say is there was way too much yum yum.  This roll was a bit rich for my liking.  I'll pass on this the next time I visit.  Saba I thought it was ok and it seemed like it didn't taste as \"oily\" as I remember it to be.  I hope that makes sense to you all...  Uni During dinner, they only allow one order of uni per person. I can totally see why...this tasted so fresh!  I was tempted to have someone order me another round but we still had a lot of food to finish.  For those of you who wonder what this tastes like, it reminds me of the fat of dungeness crabs (aka the best part of the crab).  If you still think it sounds gross, you are so missing out.  Grilled yellow tail collar Cooked to perfection! The meat easily fell off the bones and I enjoyed the tenderness of the fish and the crispiness of the outside.  Lychee sorbet Best lychee sorbet I've tasted.  This also contained chunks of lychee fruit in it. Mmmm...  Strawberry mochi Most of the time when I had this at other restaurants, this is frozen rock hard.  Sushi Mon's mochi was nice and soft while the ice cream in the inside was slightly firm.  Another good choice for dessert.  I apologize if this review was ridiculously long.  Anyways, I personally think it's worth the trip to dine here at Sushi Mon.",

The sushi is boring with little option other than something with rice around it. The sauces were mediocre and the rolls were small with what seems like a lot of rice. It doesn't deserve 4 stars for AYCE, maybe it's different if you don't get AYCE but I doubt it.",

    "text": "Not the best Sushi I have had by far, but it is good enough to keep going back to, since it is in walking distance. It is also open all night so I like to walk over and gets rolls in the A.M.  I will say this...the pricing for the all you can eat Sushi is high. I am a 190 pound male with a decent appitetite and I would have to pack it down to try to eat 4-5 rolls in order to get my money's worth. I order two rolls and I am good, so it is silly to think that I could bring a 120 pound date here and They would charge her the same as a 350 pound man. Silly.   Further more, they give you a time limit to eat. 45 min for lunch and 60 min for dinner. Normal people who want to try different rolls won't kill your business by eating you out of house and home, if you charge them a price where you aren't treating them like a sumo wrestler.   Normal people will eat 1-3 rolls and be full. Your pricing structure is old school within the industry and should be changed.  I'd like to see a date package where a couple can come in and share an all you can eat dish for 30 bucks. That's fair. That's a good price where it is a win win. A couple will probably only eat 4-5 rolls on average. Why charge them over 60 bucks to sit down for an hour to break bread?   This must be changed.   There is a burger joint in Vegas that let's you eat for free every time if you go on the scale and weight over 300 or 400 pounds. I forget what it is. The waitresses dress up like nurses and they encourage you to have a heart attack in there joint, which had happened before.  I know it is a far stretch in diversity and culture to compare the two industries, but this is Vegas! Most sushi in American already has fusion build into the menu. Change it up! Tell these big fatsos to come out their pocket! Don't take the little guys money for the same service of all you can eat! Those big bastards need to pay more! Not normal people!   That's all I have to say.",

It's much better than buying sushi a la carte, by the order, if you can eat more than 10 pairs of sushi, then you're going to really get your money's worth here.  I'd come here again.  If you're from the Los Angeles area, and know the place \"Midori\" in the Valley, this is similar to that in format and quality.  And inversely, if you like Sushi Mon in Vegas and are ever in the LA area, check out Midori.  Parking was easy, in the hot, outdoor lot shared with other retailers.",

Environment: The interior of the restaurant is not very big, but there are enough seating options that I rarely must wait a substantial amount of time to sit down even during peak hours. The sushi bar has more than enough spots but there are tables as well if you prefer that type of seating or if you are with a bigger group of people. Additionally, this restaurant has the same menu as Goyemon for those who want the same food but without the wait.  Food: This is where Sushi Mon can set itself aside from all the other all you can eat sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. They have THE best specials in town. The always have at least five different verities of special nigiri to try and each time I can try a type of fish I have never had before. Additionally, they have salmon belly and Bluefin tuna which are unlimited in orders which is great compared to most places which put a limit on such premium verities of fish. Additionally, the fish itself is always very fresh and the chefs are good about not skimping out on the cuts for the orders. Their selection of appetizers, rolls, and desserts also offer a fair amount of variety and I always leave full and happy  Service: Service is good as well as the chefs at the sushi bar make sure opt take our orders when necessary and the waiters are consistently checking up on guests to ensure that they have everything they need.  Overall I will be coming back here time and time again to satisfy my sushi craving!",

Service is usually great but I came a couple of nights ago and sat at the sushi bar and got a bad customer experience.   It was obviously a full house so me and my boyfriend were in no rush to order. But a guy named Alejandro came to us from behind the bar and asked us what would we like to order. Wonderful! We always get the same things on first order: salmon nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, and tuna nigiri. And we threw in a roll. So he makes our order except for tuna nigiri. No biggie. We know it's coming soon. 10 mins go by.. 15 mins.. (mind you there are 4 other sushi chefs and two in the back helping and they are fast with making orders)  He then hands a roll we did not order and I say we didn't order this. And he just looks at me dumbfounded like I was stupid and I didn't know what I ordered. And he asked what we order. I accidentally said salmon instead of tuna but I corrected myself right away and he just bluntly says \"well is it tuna or salmon??\" And my boyfriend corrected. Alejandro walks away and he NEVER SPOKE TO US AGAIN. He didn't even give us our order. Another 15 mins later. Nothing. I was getting super annoyed and was about to talk to a manager for how he was so helpful at first and now he was did not make any eye contact or make our food. The sushi chef next to him Jun, asked what we order and he was gonna make it for him but Alejandro saw him making it and just did it himself, but it was shitty.   Still debating if I'll return.",

But the nigiri is soooo light and yummy. I don't know what the sauce they put on it but it is delicious. I would never go here and not do AYCI. It is $26.95 for dinner and I eat triple the amount of that so it is worth it! Even if you are super full at the end, you HAVE to try the mochi balls. Strawberry flavor is the best. I will always come back no matter what because the food is bomb. Sometimes it gets a little too busy and the servers are distracted and all over the place BUT they are always very friendly so it's understanding. Can't wait to come stuff myself again.",

We came in on a Wednesday night and all the tables were full but the host got us a nice little seating area at the sushi bar. I honestly think sitting at the bar was the best way to do AYCE. You order your side dishes, rolls and desserts from the super attentive waiter and order your nigiri dishes directly from the sushi chef.  The seating time is limited to 60 minutes but the food comes out so quickly that 60 minutes is plenty of time to get your grub on.   I loved the huge selection on the menu and really enjoyed the ikura, salmon belly and super white tuna. The regular tuna wasn't the best though so skip it here. Loved the selection of desserts and side dishes. Baked mussel was delicious as was the seaweed salad. I wanted to try so much more but I was stuffed. I'll have to go back to try some more dishes.",

My in laws invited us to eat here with them one night so we happily obliged.  We got the AYCE dinner. Kids don't have reduced AYCE price, one star off for that. My kids don't eat much but I like that if they want more, they can just order. But since they didn't have kids AYCE price, we ordered a la carte for them.   We started with half Roll orders. I ordered a tiger roll and another one (I forget the exact name). All were bland and bla. Poke and nigiri were good. I was turned off by some of the food my kids ordered and by the rolls we all ordered. No umph in looks or taste at all!!   Even though my palate and stomach were satiated by the nigiri (because after a taste of the other food, they were my only options), I felt a bit robbed. After I ordered my dessert, I turn around to the sushi bar (because my dessert took a good loooong 10 min or so (ice cream scoop), and I notice a chalkboard in the back with \"specials\".  I was so annoyed because our waiter didn't tell us that our AYCE dinner included all that is listed on the chalkboard. Why was I so irked??? Because one of my favorite things to order at Japanese restaurants were up there and not on my menu at the table -- hamachi kama and sake Kama. I told the waiter I was upset because he didn't mention the specials to us. He did apologize but that did not remove the bad taste the whole place left in my mouth. Pun intended!",

    "text": "Second time here, there won't be a third.  The service was ok, the staff was kind of rude, if you are missing one person in your party they won't seat you.  Once seated they bring you drinks pretty fast but getting refills can be a challenge.  If you have empty plates on the table don't expect them to say excuse me before putting their arm in front of your face over the food you are eating and grabbing the plates.  You basically have to stop eating and move your head back so you don't get hit in the face.  My son in law said the menu was not the same as it used to be and as I experienced, if you want to order a meal plate, if you don't like teriyaki, then you have to order single items and pay more because they will not substitute the teriyaki for chicken or beef prepared another way which means you have to do side orders of soup, salad, chicken or beef, tempura, rice, California Roll, so what is a $9.95 dish with teriyaki comes out to over $20 if you can't eat teriyaki. They don't care...  The sushi rolls were good tasting but not wrapped very tight so you ended up with a mess in your dish when trying to pick up the pieces.  This place seems to have become a mill basically getting you in and out as quickly as possible, so once they decide to drop the bill on your table, don't expect anymore refills without asking even if you are not done eating yet.  They decide when it's time for you to leave without the offer of desert.  We were a party of four that will not be back to this place.",

I have always loved the friendly service from George, but there was always something missing for me when it came to the food. Thankfully that has changed. The freshness and quality of the food has improved drastically. So much that I'm here at least once a week. Good for them, bad for my diet. Hah!   Like I said, I'm here for the AYCE most of the time. The Lemon Roll is my all time favorite, along with steamed shumai, and fried chicken. However, when I'm not feeling sushi I opt for a bowl of shrimp tempura udon, which always hits the spot.   The only downside to Sushi Mon is there are no to go container for soups, which means I can't order my favorite udon as take out. It's okay though, I'll continue to come back as long as the fish remains fresh and the smiles & good service are plentiful.",

There is not one time we do not go to Sushi Mon. Sometimes, we make a trip out to Vegas just so that we can eat at Sushi Mon. We always sit at the same two seats at the corner of the sushi bar and they treat us like regulars. Their service is amazing and the staff/sushi chefs are so kind. We typically go during lunch but pay the dinner price (so that we can have uni and sweet shrimp). One time, they brought the check to us and they charged us the lunch price instead of the dinner price. I let the server know that they should've charged us more. The server took the check, came back, and let us know that they would honor the lunch price because we were honest with them. That is just the best customer service! This restaurant is doing everything right!! Thank you Sushi Mon for great food and great service! We are your forever customers!!",

    "text": "Sushi Mon is my sushi home away from home.  Since I travel to Las Vegas often, I have tried all the high end sushi eateries you can imagine.  Although all were amazing, the hit to your wallet is worse than some of the gambling tables in Vegas.    $26.95 gets you all you can eat sushi which includes a plethora of choices. Keep and eye on their chalk board for special cuts. For instance I was fortunate enough to have had Blue Fin tuna which normally is an fin and a leg - yes that was cheesy, sue me - but it was included in the deal. 1 order per person on the special items.  The house rules are simple and if you can't read, they provide simple illustrations to follow. Despite the handy instruction card they have at the bar, you will inevitably have someone try to cheat the system.  I don't know about you but the last person I try to antagonize is man who is very skilled with a super sharp knife.   If eating as much sushi as humanly possible is your objective, then void the rolls or ordering too many sides dishes.  Stick with the nigiri and venture out of your comfort zone. Don't be afraid to ask for suggestions and letting them know of any allergies you may have. I have a shell fish allergy so they prepared my sushi on a different cutting board to avoid cross contamination.  That is really going the extra mile because other sushi establishments I frequent can care less.  The attention to detail and their customer service sets them apart.   If you want great sushi at a reasonable price, Sushi Mon will definitely hit the spot. Oh and don't forget to try the lychee sorbet... Simply the best!!!",

The waitresses and staff are always so sweet to us and my daughter. We love this place because of the service and the food!  Yesterday we came to eat here and they were closed, no sign on the door nothing. We waited outside thinking maybe they were opening a little late? No big deal. A short blonde girl walks out from the back and tells us that they are closed for the day. I asked her why and she said because her staff is protesting and did not show up for work? I asked what they were protesting and she said the \" national immigrant protest \" . I then asked her well are they all legal immigrants? And she said yes so then I asked what are they protesting for then ? Her response was \" to support one another \"  Fair enough, so I then told her , you might want to put a sign on your door so other people know! ( me and 3 other people had been waiting outside 15+ minutes . ) her response was : yes we are working on that so how about you give me some time and I'll put a sign on the door for you. ( something in that context)  I told her listen, I come here ALOT , you don't have to be rude I was just suggesting to put a sign up.. , I then looked at my cousin and said let's go to island sushi. and she proceeded to then get into a pitty argument with me about how I was being rude, and how I can try to go anywhere else but all of the other sushi places are closed as well ? I called 3 within a 5 mile radius, all open. We ended up at island sushi.  Your staff doesn't show up for work, I get it you might be stressed. But treating a loyal customer that way is just unacceptable. I know that the waitresses and sushi chefs are awesome and always treat us so good, but because she went off on me for suggesting to put a sign on the door so other people don't stand around waiting, I will never ever return. No professionalism from that girl what so ever. I drive all the way from mountains edge to eat here not only because the food is good , but because they make us feel like regulars. I will never ever eat here again, my family will never eat here again and I will make sure all my friends on social media know the way my family was treated because you chose to close for the day, and take your frustration out on me. Your customers are the foundation of your business, and when they are spending hundreds a month at your location, and you treat them like that, you will go out of business fast.",

They don't have a lot of classic rolls that do many places have. Poke was literally 3 or 4 pieces of tuna with nothing else in it and little sauce. For the poke alone I would never come back here.  So many rolls fell apart too... I like that they weren't covered in layers of rice. But they still fell apart.  I ordered the yakitori but didn't touch it, it was dry, dry like a chicken gets when it's been left out too long, not from over cooking.  And the final thing was my table was completely empty before the server ever asked for another order.. still I guess I've had worse.",

The quality of the fish was okay, not as good as some other places. I did like the poki and seafood salads. My friends liked the rolls and tempura. Service was good, but as with all other ayce places, food is also forgotten. Maybe places do this on purpose if they think you've had enough.

I order about 75% of my sushi off of the list of daily specials and I primarily order nigiri. I highly recommend the salmon belly, toro, and the yellow tail belly. There fresh scallops and ama ebi are also consistently, very good. The AYCE menu includes a wide array of appetizers. The dynamite, takoyaki, baked mussels, and calamari are outstanding. Be sure to save a little room for dessert because the tempura ice cream is to die for. They of course have a variety of mochi ice cream and sorbets that you can eat to your heart's content.",

    "text": "This ain't no \"Todai - leave - all - the - seafood - out - all - dai - everydai - since yesTodai\" Seafood Buffet.   How or why I took so long to remember to Yelp this place is beyond me. This is our \"Go-To\" restaurant everytime we're in Vegas visiting my parents. If you've eaten here, you know why, if you haven't...well let me tell you...   THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST SUSHI RESTAURANTS YOU'LL EVER GO TO IN YOUR LIFE.   - First of all, the fish is flown in FRESH, from the west coast, the Gulf and sometimes Hawaii, daily.  - They don't 'skimp' on their portions. (If it's too much, you can place 1/2 an order upon request)  - For $26.00 / person, you'll definitely get your money's worth! (If you know how to order) - You can also order from the kitchen menu (hot items) You're not limited to ONLY sushi.  - It also helps if you haven't eaten much (or at all) all day. But try not to \"over order\" since you must finish what you order.  - You can share within your party, as long as whoever you share with ordered the buffet as well.   Some of my \"Sushi Mon favorites\" are the Garlic Tuna (nigiri), the Sushi Monster (huge) & the Toro (1 order / person). Other than those, I'll order the usual: Hamachi roll, Tekka maki, 9-1-1 roll, Rainbow roll...etc...   Can't forget dessert either, oh yeah it's included...I usually go for the Tempura Ice cream...make that 2 orders...   Like I said, if you know what / how to order, you'll definitely get your money's worth... But hold on...there are some drawbacks.  - Wait time can be horrendous!!! Show up as soon as they open, preferably with a party smaller than 6. - You have to finish what you order. They're really anal about you eating the rice that goes along with the fish. - I think they're only open for dinner now (5pm - 2am) They still might serve lunch at the Sahara location.  Either way, I'll stick to my guns and name this place the best sushi spot I know of...and being born and raised on an island, I know my fresh fish.",

I'm not a fan of their yellowtail sushi...one time it didn't taste fresh so now I stick to the rolls.  My fav by far is the Jay Jay roll...shrimp tempura, avocado, philly creamcheese, asparagus, wrapped in seaweed and rice...topped with eel sauce...melts in your mouth!!!!!  This roll is priced at $8.  You can't go wrong with all the other rolls either...and their reasonably priced, but if you can put down some sushi..go with the all you can eat! :) Location is decent...not like super nice but it's decent..at least they have a flat screen where they have sports on all the time!  If you have a craving for sushi and you need to feed it really quick with good sushi then this is the place, but if you want to really impress a date or significant other..hit up Yellowtail on the strip!  ps.  Jay Jay roll! my fav!",

    "text": "Sushi Mon's menu for the price, selection, and quality (especially quality of seafood brought into the desert) are the best I have ever had. I have been frequenting this place over the years and have had the same good service every time. The sushi chefs and some of the employees that I have seen and talked to here at this location are from Japan, good to have some authenticity. All of the friends that I have brought here have loved the food and usually have bought the All You Can Eat special and happy with the value. Check the Special Rolls Out! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sushi-mon.com%2Fmenu%2Fspecial%2Findex.php&s=395a2f1c4c4c75344f29ea516cfadbbd7af5e973cebe0d9c8009bd56a035bed8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sushi-mon.com/menu/speci...</a>  I recommend the All You Can Eat special; lunch time costs less than dinner, you have to eat everything you order, and you have like 45 min to an hour to eat so come hungry! If your not sharing with others consider getting half rolls so you get to try more and not fill up so quick. The special includes some non-sushi items that I like including Baked Mussels, Tempura Shrimp, Fried Calamari, and Cucumber Salad. Sushi Rolls are awesome here, flavor, the rice, the ingredients, can't go wrong. You want quality similar to local Nobu and Hamada at under $30.00 per person without feeling pretentious and don't mind simple decor then this is the place you should go in Vegas to eat sushi. Don't forget dessert, I recommend the Green Tea or Red Bean Ice Cream.  Sushi Mon use to be open until 4am way back in the day when it first started business, now it is still open pretty late, but not 24 hours. The line can get pretty long if you go during busy hours but definitely worth the wait.  Here are some pics from my last visit:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fflic.kr%2Fp%2F9sf84P&s=89a4e569867d7d912e3a3f3f799e17866dc5f362c050ab1ac3b401d887eb8b09\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flic.kr/p/9sf84P</a>  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fflic.kr%2Fp%2F9si9QE&s=19858efe67dec6556de65f8fa3f132c55291c17e032ac15053851623d832dec9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flic.kr/p/9si9QE</a>  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fflic.kr%2Fp%2F9sf9Kn&s=e2aa0f88a533e6743505a84d62d3e57b42dc807f4df2371ccc34aefa8c7b365e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flic.kr/p/9sf9Kn</a>  Don't forget to grab a punch card when you pay!

I really liked that you can order half of a roll if you don't think you can eat a whole roll..and for the price it was a great deal. For 3 rolls, 2 drinks and a salad it was $27.

Luckily we were able to get in fairly quick since word on the street is that this place usually has long lines.  Stays open 'til 2 am so perfect for those who are craving sushi this late without having to go all the way to Chinatown where other restaurants stay open late as well.  All you can eat is a bit pricey for such a small joint.  I believe it was close to being $30 unlike the $20 I'm used too in other all you can eat sushi places.  You can never go wrong with baked mussels. They serve pretty big nigiris, but it's just ok on the taste factor. I highly recommend the volcano roll and jala jala roll. But if you ordered all you can eat, just order half the original quantity of the rolls so you can try all their other rolls as well which are pretty good too. And for deserts, tempura ice cream is a must for me!    I like this place but won't be going here too often since I know other great sushi places that offer less of their ridiculous all you can eat price.",

    "text": "All you can eat fresh, delicious sushi for $27 in the hot desert in Las Vegas?  Is this a mirage?  Am I hallucinating?  Nope...it's real.  Sushimon is a must go for me everytime I am in Vegas, EVERYTIME.    Each time that I eat here, I can't believe that i'm actually eating fresh raw fish that doesn't make me hit the can later.  The sushi rice here is perfect...comes out a little warm with the right amount of vinegar taste that sushi rice should have.  I like that the fish to rice ratio is proportioned right.  Some AYCE's have too much rice, in hopes to fill you up.  Not here.  I love that the AYCE menu is double sided with nigiri, appetizers, dessert and for all you sushi lovers who think you like \"sushi\" (cooked, battered, fried, saucey rolls) they have a whole side dedicated to you.  They also have specials of the day. Toro, fresh scallop, super white tuna, even mirugai have appeared before so remember to ask your server before you miss out.  The servers are hot and cold...sometimes they are super nice and sometimes they seem like they really hate their job.  It depends on how busy they are i think.    There are a few items that are limited to one order per person...the uni, amaebi and hamachi kama.  This is understandable considering it's more on the expensive side.  If you love these items, go with someone who doesn't that way you can have their share too!     Save room for dessert because they have tempura ice cream and it is delicious!  Just a hint of tempura batter so it doesn't over power the ice cream...i wonder how do you fry ice cream?    If you are a sushi lover and want a great all you can eat experience, you have to come here.  I wish and wish that they would open one up in SF and HI so I don't have to fly to Vegas just to enjoy good quality AYCE sushi.    TIP:  No reservations and the line can get long so come early or just place your name on the list...they call your phone when your table is ready!",

So this is not your typical buffet. it's all you can eat, but they take your order and serve it to you. :) Awesome for us lazy bums.   decently priced too! under 30 bucks for lunch or dinner.   Uni- this is the first time i've enjoyed Uni. yummy buttery goodness   fresh Scallop sushi. omg this was sweet and amazing!   Miso soup was also like it was home made and the perfect balance of salt and miso.   will definitely try to talk my friends into coming her our next trip out to vegas! :)",

You have exactly one hour to eat all you can, but can order as many rolls as you want to begin with.  I was with a group of six people and we ordered 25 plates of sushi to start.  Within 10 minutes, the plates started to roll in.  Each of them was very good.  The waiter was really good.    The only reason that it wasn't a five, is a good thing.  The place is pretty small, so we had to wait an hour to get in, even on a Tuesday night.",

I came at the recommendation of a coworker and he had suggested that I try the yellowtail collar. Unfortunately they don't serve that at lunch. Three of us  ordered off the AYCE menu and the fourth person ordered ala carte. I'm so glad that Sushi Mon doesn't have that rule that everyone has to order AYCE at the table. It is also really cool too that we can order half rolls so we can try a lot more things on the menu.    We tried so many different rolls, appetizers, nigiri sushi, I can't even remember them all. What I do remember is that almost everything tasted pretty fresh, some of the rolls were really unique and they have AYCE mochi and ice cream for dessert too. Score!   We were rushing to make sure that we could eat under the 1 hour time limit at lunch, but after awhile we realized that the waiters were pretty relaxed about it. Food came out relatively fast after we ordered and the servers were pretty prompted about filling water and taking more orders.   Paid about $27 (including tax and tip) for AYCE lunch.   Sushi Mon is definitely better then some of the AYCE sushi places in Cali!",

It's a go-to sushi place when you want it done right and don't want to take any chances.  It's not particularly close to my where I live, so I don't go as often as I used to, but my friend was in town recently and she requested this place and I could not for the life of me remember why I don't go more often. Yum.  I do hate waiting for a table, but this place is worth it.  I usually stick with the nigiri here. To get more bang for my buck. The fish is always fresh. Unagi, super white tuna, spicy tuna, snapper, salmon skin handroll, yellowtail collar and salmon. There are some good specialty rolls that I get as well. The JJ, 911, and a really refreshing one I love, but the name escapes me at the moment. Probably a good idea to order half rolls to save space.  This place is a safe bet. You never know what you're getting with AYCE, but this place always makes me happy. A little more expensive than some, but definitely worth it.  Make sure to get your card stamped to earn a free AYCE!",

Was told that there was an hour wait for a party of six when there were two empty tables right in front of us.  After suggesting he combine the two, the greeter (Taku?) said the best he can do is to separate us - three ayce at the bar and the three kids at a table.  Are you kidding me?  How much does a little common sense cost us now a days huh?  They're kids for crying out loud!  Why I decided to stay is beyond me.  The service here is painfully slow.  Ordered two chicken katsu combos and a chicken teriyaki bowl for the kids and seriously, it took them 15 minutes to come out with the miso soup alone!  You can just imagine how long it took them to come out with their food.   Also, the wait time for our sushi was just the same if not longer.  Seriously, waiting more than 30 minutes for food is just too much.  Chop, chop!  So ayce... You can't share food, I get it.  But when my 5-year-old nephew wants a bite of my ice cream, gosh dang it, he can have a bite of my ice cream.  The need for our server, Jean, to act like it's the end of the world is just crazy.  Relax girl, just charge me an extra $3, not a big deal.    The service here could be much better.  Shame.  One star for the food and another for the all you can eat ice cream that comes with it.",

They have a stand out menu, especially when most of the all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants in Vegas are Korean owned and have basically the same stuff. The chefs were so quick with our orders and their selection of fish was incredibly fresh. They have a board of daily specials near the back of the restaurant that we definitely ordered from and they were all delicious. From their regular menu, I would recommend their uni - it was one of the freshest I've had in Vegas. Or if you're into rolls, the Sexy Girl roll (HUGE but they do half rolls if that's more your style). The best part of my visit was the service - our waiter, Joseph, was SOOO friendly and approachable with our questions (also very trustworthy when it comes to recommendations). My mom and I also had the pleasure of chatting with Ziggy, another waiter I think, and he was very sweet and funny. This restaurant is a bit of a drive from my house but it is worth the distance and I look forward to the next time :)",

They only down side to sushi mon is that uni is limited to 1 per person for the ayce.",

I really like their Veggie roll. Of course, some chefs make it better than others, but it's still good. I also like the spicy tuna rolls quite a bit. The service is usually good. But, sometimes with different people coming to check on you & getting you refills, it can be lacking. Still, better service than most AYCE sushi places.  The only bad thing is the crowds. There are often very long waits, and sometimes the company isn't too great either. Last time we got stuck to a group of people older than me (I'm 26) talking about how drunk they were and yelling \"penis.\" Not the restaurants fault of course.",

The dynamite was good but it took a while for them to bring it out. I actually had to ask them again for it. And since it was sweet, I needed to off-set the taste so I also ordered shumai. It took half an hour and still no shumai. I finally asked one of the servers for it and within a couple minutes, they brought it out. Were they just sitting on it?",

For $35 (dinner) this is definitely a bargain...especially since the quality is up there.  I hate to admit...but their rolls are pretty amazing. I'm usually not a fan of rolls but their sexy girl and ecstasy rolls were my favorites.   Their selection of nigiri sushi is pretty good. Don't forget to look at their specials...those are usually too good to pass up!   Did I mention I'm a fan of their tempura ice cream? Soooo good!   And I'll be honest, service here sucks (go figure). They're slow as heck but you definitely get your money's worth (and then some) so whatevers. I'll overlook the poor service this time.",

The bussers obviously are not aware of the fact they should be picking up plates etc. throughout a persons entire meal instead of letting them pile up.   Service at the sushi bar is okay. Servers don't seem to pay much mind to those eating at the sushi bar.  The few times I've ate here I've received the same horrible service. So sad.. Management should have a meeting with staff in regards to service and what it should be.  Think I tried for my last time as it's always disappointing....",

    "text": "Sushi Mon is a solid place for AYCE sushi, but not as creative as their new venture. Although some of the rolls are the same as Goyemon, Sushi Mon does not have the awesome appetizers and desserts that the other restaurant does.   The quality of fish is the same, the service is better, but the variety is lacking. If you ignore these minor complaints, the difficulty in picking up the nigiri was the major problem of the night. The ones that had a sauce splashed on top fell apart too easily. Instead of drizzling it lightly on the fish, they put it directly on the rice which caused it to loosen up on contact.   The rolls are nothing particularly special, so nigiri is definitely the way to go. The nice large pieces of fish placed on a proportionate piece of rice was perfection.   I didn't know that they use the same stamp card as Goyemon, so if your waitress ask if you have a card give them that card. I looked at the one she gave me and asked if I could just get my Goyemon stamped, but they will not combine. Be prepared and just add on to your preexisting one.",

Kids under 10 are half off, for lunch & Kids under 10 are half off, for dinner, as well.  NOT worth the wait! I've tasted better food at other Japanese restaurants & I've had excellent customer service at other restaurants, in general. The GOOD, the servers seem friendly & seem to move fast waiting on their customers. The BAD, crowded restaurant & it's loud, the extended wait time to get a table or a seat at the bar. Customers see employees gathered around the host / hostess area chit chatting with each other & not paying attention to their customers. The manager doesn't smile, moves slow, not professional, not friendly, lacks skills to be a manager & does not resolve matters for customers. They should get rid of him & get a experienced manager. Do they have an assistant manager? Doesn't seem like it. It's not a kid friendly restaurant & they don't have a kid's menu. Seriously time to BOYCOTT Sushi Mon...",

The one thing I love about Sushi Mon is they include appetizers in the all-you-can-eat menu. The sushi is delicious. I mean, it is an all-you-can-eat place, but the seafood is pretty darn good quality. I usually get this knotty feeling in my stomach when I eat mediocre fish, and the only reason why my tummy aches from this place is cause by over eating. I will admit, I usually have to loosen my belt a few notches at the conclusion of my meal. I've listed my favorites below. The garlic tuna and cajun albacore are must tries! I used to order 5 orders of this. My significant other at the time hated raw fish. After tasting the garlic tuna and cajun albacore, they were sold!

The sushi had a bad aftertaste as well as the seaweed salad, which I normally love...(my mouth is offended the whole time..this was said by my boyfriend whilst eating)..my reaction was just as bad, I kind of wanted to throw up when I got home to make up for what I put in my stomach.
