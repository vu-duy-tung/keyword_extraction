Recently the service is getting pretty bad. I've been waiting ~ 15-20 mins for my first beer. Which is ridiculous. When I confronted the staff all they could say is they were understaffed. I've seen other bars  with a single bartender and 1 or 2 servers handle a similar crowd with no issues. What the hell is up with this place. Their food is also hit or miss.",

Adonna, Jaime, Colleen, Misty and Adam make it such a great environment to just relax and take a break from life. The machines are paying really good. Lots of money to be made. The food is some of the best bar food I've ever had, and I've had a lot of bar food. Can't go wrong with the French Dip, Burger or Mac n Cheese. They are all amazing, but that's all I've tried so far. They make the best Jack and Coke in town.  It's almost football season, this will be the new best place to watch football. They have a million TVs, so chances are the game you want will be on.",

It took the waitress like 20 min just to get our drink order, after another 20 mins we get our beers which by the way they have a large selection.  After another 20 mins they waitress comes back and gets our food order. We ordered onion rings, a steak wrap and a grilled cheese sandwich.  The onion rings were  cold and greasy the steak wrap was mostly chunks of steak fat and the grilled cheese was ok but cold.  I think the only thing I enjoyed was the fries but i think It was because I was soo hungry.   Food was mediocre and the service was terrible. Will only give one star because of the beer selection.  Will not be coming back here!",

For some reason, this management thinks its only necessary to have one server for the entire bar and restaurant. This has happened all three times I have been here. Not only is it under staffed, the servers are untrained in customer service. No apology for waiting 15 minutes just to see a menu and order drinks. If you have time to wait around for 3 hours to eat at bar and be unattended to then eat here. I suggest you skip this place. Please hire more staff and train your servers correctly!",

The brew selection is so vast, that if you can't find a brew you like, you should probably go-home and re evaluate your priorities.  I had the special that night which was a pork something or other that was insanely good, but I don't quite remember it's name because, ale.    I usually remember these things.    Ok, the brews (had a sampler - wow!) and food are really good here - not your usual bar-food tripe.  Someone here is passionate about quality brewing and food.  There's plenty of TVs and lots of music and good vibes from the patrons and employees.  When he could - the bartender asked me thoughtful questions when I asked for recommendations and took the time to speak with those who expressed interest in his offerings.  He even had some stories to go with the different brews which added context to the session. Pretty cool. I was flying (or floating) solo, and ended-up sitting away from the bar and at a table with a small group of friendly locals who are also passionate about this place.    Business trips can be very impersonal experiences - so this was a nice break-away.  I'm going to return and maybe keep notes next time because I sure as hell am going to come thirsty and hungry.  I suggest going with the flow and have the specials offered because that is where the cooks passion is directed at that point in time.  note:  They have a better than average whiskey selection here as well - maybe I don't rememeber everything because, whiskey.  Cheers!",

TVs everywhere and we were able to watch all the games we were interested in.  The beer was great and the bartender, Kim, was so knowledgeable.  We both chose to flights and Kim created mine completely from the knowledge of the fact that unlike my husband I do not like IPAs.  It was hard to chose a favorite from my selection.  Kim also engaged us throughout our morning giving us tips of shows and other off strip establishments we had to visit.  She made the experience so amazing, that we returned on Sunday for football again.  The regular crowd was there, but the place wasn't packed and not smokey at all, which are huge pluses for an off strip location.  We did try the food on both occasions and enjoyed everything we tried.  I had the green apple, bacon, grilled cheese and my husband had the salami grilled cheese.  We also tried the cheese curds and the beer bites  (which was served with a beer cheese dipping sauce that I would ask for a double helping of!).  This would be our regular bar if we lived here and we would run through the food menu because everything was wonderful.  I highly recommend checking this place out.  Especially in the morning to early afternoon so you get Kim.",

And I'm not a big person at all (5'3\" 111lbs). The other half of the room is big, open and overly well lit, for a bar). I don't know about you, but I don't like to drink in a bright ass room.

Courtney was probably the best server we've had, but we come in one night to see her and unfortunately find out she was let go. Shame because she was awesome. Last week we ordered ahi tuna salad and a French dip and my bf and I were so sick all night. As we haven't been sick before, we decided to try again...Tonight I ordered nachos with extra cheese. The nachos came with a sprinkle of UNMELTED cheese. I ordered extra sour cream as there was barely anything on the tortilla chips and the server never came back with it. One person in our group ordered tacos, never came. Beer selection is good, food is awful, and service is worse.  EDIT: the tacos and sour cream finally came...40 minutes later.",

The the \"Too Good\" burger was \"bomb\" as my boyfriend stated. As I blinked and looked over, the burger was gone. Bye bye burger! It was good knowing you! Our plates were completely empty when we left. Super great beer selection as well. There is a large selection of craft beers that you can't find just anywhere. I recommend the Beachwood IPA for the IPA fans. Lots of fun events that we were informed of as well that we can't wait to attend. So many fun events to come with really great beer, food and fast friendly service. We will be returning.",

There was only 2 small pieces of fish in the fish & chips. The cheeseburger was kind of small and had wilted lettuce and a VERY thick whole slice of onion! Also no mayo (ketchup and mustard on the table). This after the waitress was very excited to tell us they serve huge portions! The next night my husband was talking to someone about it and they said you should only go to the Nellis location because it is totally different  (much better). We will not be returning here!",

We ordered two of the lunch boxes, the food took over 30mins to get. We also ordered fried deviled eggs, which came out right before our food came even though we ordered it before our meal.  I watched the cook make my husbands side salad and saw that he was not wearing gloves when he made it. For as slow as they were the food should not have taken that long to make. We will not be returning to the restaurant.",

    "text": "I have no idea how this place EVER got 5 stars. Here is a review that was not written by one of their employees in case you want to know what this place is really like. I went to this bar for the first time on Friday and Ito was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a bar.  First of all, everyone keeps commenting on their \"craft\" beers, but their selection was nothing special. Most of the beers are things you could find at the grocery store and the names were all pretty familiar. To make it worse, my boyfriend tried to order four different beers and they kept saying they were out.  That might not have been so bad if the waitresses hadn't disappeared for 20 minutes each time he tried to order one.  The worst part of the experience was definitely the service. The waitress was a complete bitch. The first time she came to the table she spent about 5 seconds there and gave us no explanation for the confusing menu. After that there was no sight of her for a good 25 minutes despite the fact that the place was not busy. A different waitress eventually came and took our order. The only time the first waitress came back was to be super rude to my friend who politely asked if they had any vegan-friendly drinks. After basically telling my friend she wasn't a True vegan because of what she ordered she she stormed off and didn't come to our table the rest of the night.  When I wanted to get my check I tried to signal her, but she was clearly intentionally ignoring our table. She would go up to the bar and chat with her waitress friends and then chat with the bartender and then she would turn away for our table without even giving us a glance. I had to go up to the bar and tell them no one had visited our table in 30 minutes and we would like our check. I didn't get any sort of apology, but I did get my check and got the hell out of there.   If you want terrible service in a bar that really has noting special to offer then this is the place for you. I, for one, will never be returning to Aces and Ales.",

    "text": "We were going to make a return trip to the Nellis location and then I noticed they have a 2nd one now, which was much closer to where we were staying.  On Sept 3rd we ventured over for an early dinner, and I was really impressed with their new space.  It's got high ceilings and a cool bar right in the middle with lots of taps, but still has that dark and relaxing feel to it that the other location has.  We started with the beer bites with a stout and a honey wheat beer.  Each of those were 5 bucks and really hit the spot.  Kimberly took great care of us and would frequently stop by just to see if we needed anything.  For the main meal I ordered the Mirror Pond brats, no bun, and Mr. M ordered the grilled cheese with green apple and bacon & onion rings for the side.  That grilled cheese and o rings were just as good as I remember.  5 stars!  And the brats were really delicious and full of flavor.  The kraut on the side seemed like it came from a can and was really bland.  I would challenge them to make some fresh kraut like the Germans do.  That would really make that meal.    All in we spent $41 before tax and tip.  Not too bad at all.  I know there are many places I should try in Vegas, but every time we go back I have to visit Aces & Ales.  We always have a great time.",

We had a private group of about 25-30 people this time, and it  appeared our one waitress was struggling to keep up with our drink requests. I'm not sure if it was her fault entirely, or if the bar was that busy, but it seemed our drinks were taking at least 15 minutes from the time we ordered them. Lucky for us the food was already setup when we first arrived.       The food here is your typical bar & grill kinda food. Pizza, chicken tenders, wings, burgers and sandwiches. For our party we had pizza's (spaghetti pizza was a hit amongst our guests), firecracker buffalo wings (pretty spicy), Arrogant Bastard Ale cheese balls (good bar snack), & meatballs (had the most left overs).      As far as drinks are concerned, they had a plethora of choices to pick from. I was like a kid in a candy store. I really enjoyed #5, #19 & #28. The number designation is how you order beer around here. If you don't, the waitress will look at you with a clueless face, and ask for the number on the menu anyway.       This is a great place to come with your friends, relax and enjoy beers with sports. There is no shortage of T.V.'s or drinks here.",

    "text": "Aces and Ales is an upscale bar with an impressive list of craft brews on tap. The menu is extensive and features unique dining options (beer candied bacon, anyone?) in addition to the usual bar food (nachos and pizza). It has never smelled like cigarette smoke inside, and I only eat on the bar side of the pub. I came here with a Groupon for $15 for $30.   BEER BITES ($6.50): I've ordered these in the past, but this time the beer bites were pretty lackluster. They were all parmesan and no garlic, all bark and no bite. The bites come with a trio of sauces: beer cheese, marinara sauce, and queso dip. They seemed to be nuked. The beer cheese didn't taste like anything at all. Probably won't order these again. 2/5      CAJUN MAC & CHEESE ($11.50): Minus the sausage and onions of course. I always get this when I come here because it's so delicious. Again, it did not compare to previous visits. It had a powerful greasy taste to it and lacked the usual spicy kick. No bueno. I'll try something different the next time I come here. 2/5   FISH TACOS ($13): My guy had to pull out the jalapenos because they were so spicy! He couldn't handle the heat lol. Overall, he said this dish was just okay. 3/5  THE COOKIE THING ($6): Hated it. Took one bite and said no way. The description made it sound like a wonderful chocolate chip cookie. Instead it looked and tasted like a burnt brownie. 1/5  DEEP FRIED OREOS ($6): Of course it was delicious. They're fried oreos! It's a huge portion of fatty goodness. Hmmmm. I swapped the cookie thing out for the oreos. 4.5/5     SERVICE: It's seat yourself. Also, make sure you have at least an hour and a half to spare if you choose to dine at Aces and Ales, because service is aggravatingly slow. If you can get past the slow turn out times of the kitchen staff and the slow service received by servers, Aces and Ales is a great local bar to hang out at. 2/5   VIBE: I love the vibe at Aces and Ales. There's a mix of young and old here. On my most recent visit, my husband and I were over the moon about the playlist. Aces and Ales was actually playing good music! Slipknot, Faith No More, and Slayer were our favorite bands that graced the playlist. Apparently the bartender was in charge of the music set, and we made sure to thank him for the great music before we left. 4/5    Worth a Return Visit? So this particular visit was a flop with the food, but my husband and I remain fans! Make sure you come with a Groupon (there's a $15 for $30 deal for dinner), because food can get expensive real quick. I'd recommend checking out this bar if you're big on craft beer and are looking for bar with a twist to the usual bar grub.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #175",

The taps are great, but I also noticed rare beer you can buy by the bottle in fridges when you walk in.  I'm not sure how it works in Nevada, but at worst you should be able to pop the bottle open and enjoy the beer at the bar.  Maybe they might let you buy them to go, but I can't say that for sure.",

We came here for Valentine's dinner, and I was pleasantly surprised to see hardly anyone here at 7 pm that night. You seat yourself (there is a sign explaining this), and we picked a nice booth on the bar side. I love the booths because they are pub table height but they have little rests to put your feet, so you aren't hanging in mid-air.   Both the greeter and server were super nice. Heather, our server, took so much time explaining craft beer offerings to us, and let us sample one or two before deciding. We had a great time trying some new drinks and talking to the staff about them.   For food, we ordered the ahi tuna salad and Arrogant Bastard steak salad (steak grilled to order). The food came out quickly, and the presentation was beautiful. Both tasted amazing. The ahi tuna was perfectly seared.   I loved the ambiance in here as well. For a little bar, it's actually a tad romantic - low lighting, candles on the tables, great music playing.   I def. want to come back to try their Tuesday night beer flights!",

They were so patient and found me my perfect beer.    Now on to the food.  We tried a lot of things with the standouts being the mac and cheese with lobster (yum), wings (perfectly cooked and tasty), prime rib dip and saving the best for last......the spaghetti pizza!  This thing is insane and made me the envy of my whole section.  Deep dish and layered with pepperoni, what seemed like several types of Italian sausage and of course spaghetti.  It is a lot to eat, probably weighs in at 20 lbs, so bring reinforcements.  I had 3 other people and still took almost half to my teenage son who immediately fell in love with the pizza.  Oh and their ranch is to die for.  Asked for a gallon to go...eh I tried anyway.  Waiting for this pizza to show up on one of those best eats shows.  DO IT!!",

I told the bartender what I normally like and he made excellent recommendations based on my taste. I had the pork tacos for lunch with chips and guacamole. The chips were homemade, the pork was juicy and the guac was so fresh and tasty. I also spent a fair amount of time playing the machines and the machines play back! which is a plus! I left with more than I came with each time and who can ask for anything better than that??? Overall this place is great. Upbeat, friendly and I would say open to any kind of visitor. My mom who went with me and is in from on out of town swears she will never go anywhere else lol!",

    "text": "I'm so glad this location opened in the northwest, the first site is just too far for me.  BEER SNOBS come here! Up to FIFTY excellent craft brews on tap, plus an extensive bottle collection, even a few cans (Oskar Blues). I'm a hop head and there are at least 10 varieties of IPAs on the menu every time I've been here, plus plenty of reds, browns, stouts, and lagers of all styles. PLUS sour beers! You have not lived until you've tried a gueze (extremely sour beer, an acquired taste). My favorite bartender so far is Matt (SING: \"His name is my name too!\"), he is very passionate and knowledgeable about beer and even cracked open a bottle of Lips of Faith to share with us at the end of his shift when he heard two of my companions hadn't had any sour brews before. Oh, and they do growler fills, bring your own or buy one there. I also was able to get 1 oz tastes of quite a few before ordering.  FOOD! It's pretty dang good, they've thinned out the menu recently, no more Capt. Crunch waffles (never tried it) or Greek style Mac n cheese (meh, wasn't great) or their salmon entree (sorry to see that go, I liked it). I was super hungry this time so I ordered the damn Arrogant Bastard onion rings (not bad, couldn't really taste the AB) and the ahi tuna salad (fantastic after I added avocado). My friend had the steak wrap & she liked it. After midnight, their happy hour kicks in, their Mac n cheese is $5, so I tried it Cajun style, with andoullie sausage, which was also excellent. MUSIC: There's a TouchTunes jukebox so you can throw your songs on without having to even leave your seat! Plus there's the added fun of anonymously Rick Rolling the bar, or playing your favorite song as your own personal walk-in music when you arrive, since there are speakers out front. TVs: Plenty of them, tunes to a variety of sports networks, your bartender can find channels for you.  SERVICE: Sometimes it can be difficult to catch the bartenders' eye, but they are friendly and helpful. Overall, I really dig this place, it has become my neighborhood go-to bar.",

She makes great suggestions for beer to try based on my tastes and she never gets it wrong. Misty, James and Crystal never get it wrong either. It is important that I go to a place the employees are happy and genuinely like their jobs. It really shows in the service and atmosphere. The food is great. The patrons are fun and it's always great to hang out and meet new people. This is my go to bar in Vegas at any time, day or night.",

    "text": "Aces & Ales is one of the handful of places that offer craft brew and I'm excited to have a location on this side of town since the SE location makes it to where we don't go often.  I wasn't up for a beer but the BF got a Nitro tapped stout Hauling Oates which I think was superior on the tap than the bottle.    We shared our two sandwiches.   Jalapeno popper grilled cheese- they use fresh jalapenos and it definitely had some kick. It was crispy, but not overly greasy, right amount of cheese and jalapenos for me. I think the only thing I could say badly was for cheese, white bread and a jalapeno $10 might not be worth it.   Turkey, avocado & bacon - this was a pretty yummy sandwich. It's not the typical turkey club bar sandwich as it came on a ciabatta and had a nice basil mayo in it. The portion was pretty generous with the meat.    Sandwiches come with either regular fries or sweet potato so we did with one of each. Both options are solid, came crispy and well seasoned.   It seems their service is spotty based on other reviews and this is where I was a little worried about dining here. Our gal was nice and I thought it was decent service considering she was the only one working the floor and others were the bar. We got our food and refills at acceptable intervals.  I think their bar food is above average greasy spoon fare and worth trying and their tap selection is one of the better you will find in town.  I definitely will be back.",

My son and I went there today and only had about an hour and 1/2 to eat our lunch.  We thought - no problem!   When we got there, the parking lot was dead.  We were the only people in the restaurant part.  We went ahead and seated ourselves as the sign stated and within a couple of minutes a server (didn't see her name) came over and gave us menus.  I told her I had a Groupon and she looked at me and then told my son we must purchase an entree, no lunch specials were allowed to be purchased through the Groupon.  Fine...we looked through the menu and decided what we wanted.  We sat there waiting ... waiting ... a guy came out of the kitchen and i said loud enough for him to hear me, do you know where the server is?!!  He acted as if he didn't hear me and turned to watch and cheer for the soccer game playing on the screen above.  There were people sitting at the bar who also could clearly see us!  Here we sat and sat - no drinks - no order - no service!  We got up and left!  Won't be going back - requesting a Groupon refund!!!",

My three star deduction is because the customer service is horrible. Usually I come in, sit at the bar, put some money in machine, start gambling and it's at least ten minutes until I'm acknowledged. This is because the bartenders are usually flirting with the patrons and/or the staff.   Usually when I go to a bar, I like to gamble and usually a few drinks get comped in exchange. Nope, not here. My friend and I put in a combined $150 one night and only had ONE $5 drink comped each...seriously?! Meanwhile, I told my guy friends about this place, they came in, gambled and had all their drinks comped AND were given drink coupons. This drove me nuts since they wouldn't have even come to this place if it wasn't for me.   At my most recent visit I gambled, had some dinner and two drinks with a friend. They comped one drink on my bill and I left. Then my friend informs me later that they comped one of his drinks...mind you, he wasn't even gambling! I don't get it.   I've worked in the industry for the past few years and I definitely won't be frequenting this place any time soon. Customer service is everything and it's definitely lacking at this establishment.",

Well, when there are only 6 or 7 other people in the whole restauraunt and you watch people walk in, and they just stand around because there's no sign that says \"serve yourself\", you figure you could say something.  I was tempted to walk out because of the lack of service. There's 1 guy at the bar, taking care of people, and 1 woman walking around... doing who know's what? A group of 4 people walk in, that's pretty obvious, and yet we don't get acknowledged whatsoever.  We come to sit ourselves so we don't make the situation even more awkward and our server comes over within a minute. We didn't have much time to look over the \"beer menu\" before being asked but my friends made their decisions.   We got the Nacho Average Nachos and grilled artichoke. Guys, if you want artichoke, just make it at home. It was really well seasoned but not worth $9, in the slightest. The nachos actually did seem pretty average to me. No beans, just chips, cheese, and mango/pineapple pico de gallo  with jalapenos. Also something I would just rather make at home, for much cheaper.  I was really excited about this place, as a vegetarian, since it has a full grilled cheese and mac n cheese menu. I got the Southsider grilled cheese and I have to say, it was pretty damn amazing. It was the redeeming factor. Their fries were pretty damn tastey as well. My friends ordered the Moondog grilled cheese and buffalo chicken mac n cheese. They said the Moondog was surprisingly spicy, but tasty and DEFINITELY recommended the buffalo chicken mac n cheese.   Also, get the deep fried oreos. You won't regret it, they were amazing. I'd never had them before but I will get them again if I come back!!  Overall, with our Groupon that covered $30, there was still a $70 balance or so which is a bit more than I expected it to be. I mean, there were two appetizers, three entrees, a desert, and 5 beers so it was a good amount of stuff for $100 but I didn't feel like it was worth it... Maybe it was the fact that we spent $20 alone on two appetizers that weren't that satisfying.  p.s. The music was all over the place. Country for the most part but then it would randomly change....",

Their pizzas are great value with good happy hour specials.  The Eddie Spaghetti is a combination of eating spaghetti and pizza.  It's a massive carb overload.  They should have an eating contest if someone can eat the whole thing.  It's filling - after 2 slices i get the meat sweats.  So why 3 stars?  Well the service is pretty bad.  We try to grab a table right by the kitchen.  After watching my friend wait for her pretzel app on the food line for 5-10 mins, I took more initiative and grabbed my salad from the line.  I talked to the chef and asked him for sides of ranch b/c our server was no where in site.  I felt like I was part NFL playoff spectator, part time customer, and part time expediter.  I bet they wouldnt even notice if i jacked a couple plates of food and pulled a 5 finger!  Food is great but dont expect 5 star service!",

However, the Groupon stated it was for 4 or more, so we were unable to use the entire $60.00. They did let us use it for the amount it was purchased for.  We ordered the regular nachos as an appetizer, the caprese grilled cheese sandwich and the arrogant bastard steak sandwich as our entrees and a beer each. Everything was good. We really enjoyed the atmosphere. As the Broncos/Chiefs game began, it started to fill up pretty quick.  It seemed like a fun place to stay and watch the game but we had to leave right after dinner.",

    "text": "So, I think that Aces & Ales needs to decide what kind of bar it wants to be.  I love the food and the craft beers but everything else pretty much sucks. The service is usually geared towards the \"regulars\" so if you are not one...good luck. Not that they are mean or rude or anything, they just shrug you off a bit.  When I was there on a Tuesday evening, it was mostly video poker players and their free Bud/Miller/Coors Lights. Maybe because you can't get comp'ed for craft beers? Is this a craft beer bar or just another creepy video poker bar?  Lastly, I realize I am biased being a non-smoker, but I don't see how you can enjoy the great food and great craft beers with chain smokers all around you. Maybe I missed the \"less\" smokey area?  To summarize, they have great food and craft beer but the environment very much distracts from this.",

    "text": "My friend and I arrived later than everyone else on a Friday night. Right when we arrived our friends warned us to order ASAP because the waitress (krystal) was slow and they were all still waiting on there beers. I looked around and there's were empty tables everywhere so I'm not sure why it was slow. The waitress took my order once someone caught her attention to let her know new guests had arrived. I started off with an order of chicken fingers and a number 3 beer. (You have to order the beers by number not name) another sir at our table had also ordered a beer. After 20 minutes of waiting for my chicken fingers I noticed another waiter take them to the wrong table and talk to the chef then after another five minutes they came to me.   Food was average and over priced. The chicken tenders looked overlooked and they were. I had to dip them in ranch constantly to get some type of moisture. And for $9 I would hope to get some fries with the tenders at least but nope just 4 average size tenders.   Another one of our friends arrived a little later due to work and when we told the waiter if she can take his order she (very sarcastically) said \"wow! Another person, this is so great\" and took his order and walked away without a smile or asking if everyone was doing alright. Once everyone started to leave we were getting our checks and a few people had left already and one of our friends left without ever receiving his beer but I let him have mine since I had water. The waitress tried leaving his check with us and I reminded her he never got his, she tried arguing saying he did but there were no cups near where he was sitting, she rolled her eyes and walked away without saying anything and didn't give me my full amount of change.   Usually I would understand if a waitress is busy with tables and trying to make an effort to please the tables but this waitress seemed like she was ready to get us all out of there and get her money. Not going back!",

Large in size and seemingly crafted from an old barn with comfortable communal seating amidst the glow of two-dozen televisions and gentle fluorescent lights it was mere moments after entrance that we were greeted by our young waitress and although not much help on the enormous beer list her service proved competent, each of six plates and six beers brought with good pacing and wide-smiles as water glasses continually brimmed full.  Unable to speak to the beer flight but impressed by the $12 tab it was with bar-food-staple soft pretzels alongside squeaky curds that we began and with both golden bites proving plenty salty it was the sauces that served as game-changers -  the funky bleu, beer cheese, and queso all remarkable.  Moving next to things more substantial it was to a truly cheesy trio that we were next treated and although the pizza could have tolerated a few more minutes in the oven to firm up the crust I was more than impressed by the ingredient quality across the board - bright Romas and fresh basil on the pie while crisp bacon and snappy apples graced the toasty sandwich, a skillet of tender macaroni under a blend of cream, cheese, and breadcrumbs rounding out the troika.  Never one to end a good meal without something sweet it was last but not least that we rounded out the evening with a steamy skillet cookie riddled with chocolate chips and eating more as a pudding than a cookie beneath Blue Bell Vanilla as Gaborik ended the game I couldn't help but smile...they just don't do sports bars like this back in Ohio.",

We took an Uber from the North Las Vegas airport, and the other pilot and I were just looking for something within walking distance of our hotel.  First impression was that this place was hopping.  About eight TV screens on either of two walls, showing NHL, NFL and the last game of the World Series.  Very, very loud.  Unnecessarily loud.  Other guy was intrigued by \"World's Best Beer Cheese Soup\" and ordered that with some kind of burger.  I asked for a small sausage pizza.  He said the soup was thin, runny and way too salty.  Didn't offer an opinion on his burger.  My pizza was pretty disappointing.  Lots of crust on the outside, thin crust in the middle, lots of cheese but just tiny pieces of sausage.  I needed a knife and fork to eat the middle part, discarded the outside crust, which was way too thick, and cursed myself for not finding something else on the menu.  I guess for a sports bar it was OK.  I do wish there had been another place nearby.",

    "text": "BEEN EDITED - READ FIRST AND SEE EDITS AT END.   Aces and Ales used to be my favorite beer place ever. In fact, it's incredibly sentimental... but I won't be back. I used to go a long time ago - when they did flights. Flights used to be $12 - then they were upped to $16 and I started going less and less. Tonight - I decided to be nostalgic and go back, but they had done away with flights (and we were not told when we got there) and each 5oz pour was priced SEPARATELY. Which was not stated. I got 1 flight, 1 appetizer, 2 full pours, and my bill was $81. We asked for a flight, but she did not correct us and tell us flights are no longer an option.  Flights are a standard for any company who prides themselves in beer and this is overpriced. They are going to ruin this business and that absolutely sucks. A Saturday night with the Golden Knights game and it was not packed - which is unusual and sad. Bring back flights for a standard price and I can see this place thriving again. Until then - we will not be back. Service was great, server got a nice tip, but I'm angry that the owners are going to ruin a great establishment.  EDIT: I did talk to the Director of Operations - and he was kind  and polite and explained to me the breakdown. I appreciate customer service. However, I still think a set flight price is something that needs to happen again. It's what beer drinkers are used to and what curious beer drinkers expect. If you want to reel in exploratory customers - advertising a set flight price is something that definitely draws me and my friends in.",

They have 40 some beers on tap, rotating frequently, and a number of bottled beers. Every time I've ordered food, it's always been really good (with one exception but that could have been just me.) Big fan of the deviled eggs, both versions. They also have beer events from time to time, as well as quiz nights, and gaming nights. It's not usually crowded but they do allow smoking indoors. As long as they keep rotating their taps, I'll keep coming back.",

My coworker of two weeks was having her 21st birthday so what better way to introduce her to adulthood than to take her to Aces and Ales? Big Dogs was great (that is in another review I will write soon) but was getting old so we decided to try something a little different.   We all sat down together outside on the patio. I ordered the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale as the Californian in the house (and my coworker who was from Chico was very proud since they brew it there). My other coworker arrived and ordered some beer/ale strongly wheat or barely based (this one always gets that). They enjoyed it. I enjoyed my Sierra Nevada as well. Then some ordered macaroni and cheese, that was also good.   Then I noticed people were entering the main room and I wondered why. I heard they were singing karaoke. I had some choices on a song. The choice I had was Applause by Lady Gaga because cmon, we needed some cheering in here.   I picked Applause which was the right decision (at the time) and sang. Boy did I get a strong reception. After this dinner, whenever anyone mentioned karaoke, they always pointed to me and said, \"Applause.\" That was a good choice at a good pub with strong beer and strong macaroni and cheese. Overall, I am very happy I was here and do not worry, Aces and Ales gets an Applause!",

A burger fries and a beer cost me $30 still. You're better off going to Steiners on buffalo down the street better service and way better food.

The juicy lucifer is a stuffed burger, filled with chorizo, cheese, and jalapeno's!!  And it's OUTSTANDING!!  Choice of fries is sweet potato or regular, both are tasty, and for a little more dough you can get the parmesan fries which are well worth the money!!  I also recommend the cheese curds,,, probably not the most healthy of options, but hey, you only live once!! As for beers, the draft list is 50 deep and constantly rotates through different beers.  And these aren't your daddy's beers, no milbudcoors headache domestic drafts, we're talking beers like Speakeasy Black Lager, DogfishHead Choc Lobster Brew,  Big Bad Baptist's, Delirium Red!!   The staff is great, and most seem knowledgeable on the taps available.  And if you'd like to, you can even sample most of the 50 on the ever changing list!   A great place for bar food, an even better place for beer!!",

This was my first time at the Westside location, which is far closer to my normal stomping grounds.  I arrived with another beer snob friend, who had also not yet visited this location, and we were immediately greeted by a very friendly waitress. She provided us with some suggestions on both food and beer. We did not take her up on the food (she did mention that the pizza oven was not yet installed), but did take her up on the beer.  There are 50 taps available, and I only saw one that was not craft (Blue Moon). The selection is very diverse with different styles and different breweries. I didn't immediately notice the size of servings on the beer menu, so I was a bit shocked when I didn't get a pint of my first beer.   After having 3 beers (the Joseph James Citra Rye was my favorite of the evening) and receiving our bill, we noticed that all the beers we had were $6/each.  I really liked that the place is still new so I didn't walk out smelling like smoke. The staff was really friendly and the clientele was pretty low-key, which is exactly what I am looking for in a good beer bar.  I will definitely be back for the amazing beer selection and the delightful ambiance.",

    "text": "Having visited the original A&A on the South East side of town, I was excited to learn they were going to open a location on the NW.  Atmosphere - The bar is very open and fun with 3 areas.  There is an outdoor patio and the inside is divided in two with a main bar area with gaming and tables and the other with long tables for better socializing.  They also have trivia night there occasionally.  Drink Selections - Stocked with a full bar and the rotating beer menu can't be beat, especially for locals.  Food - There is a good variety of items on the menu and I've always found the quality to be consistent for decent bar food. I know some people don't have great feedback on the food, some of my friends included, but after a couple pints you can't go wrong with some pretzel bites.  Considering these, Aces & Ales is an easy 4, if not 5 star.  It's unfortunate I feel I need to rate it a 3 based on the service. Many times the bar seems to be understaffed with one bartender also working the surrounding tables.  Even with multiple servers, the service can be poor and slow.  With a table of 4-6 people ordering food and drinks, we've gone more than an hour without being checked on and any special request seems to be a burden.  Despite this, the bar is worth a visit to check on some beers you won't find anywhere else in the valley.",

Even though there are 50 beers advertised on draft, they are usually out of about 10 of them at any given time. They also have many which are of the same kind (5 Imperial Stouts, maybe 10 IPA's). I'd like to see more variety, especially with wild ales and sours. Their food menu has been limited since they've been open, and there's no longer breakfast all day. Their breakfast wrap is my favorite item on the menu and it's good amy time of day to me. But with beers that change all the time on tap, I'm always coming back to them. And their service staff is some of the best in town and they remember you. Outdoor patio is awesome with a fire pit and plenty of seating. Great place for watching any kind of sports. I definitely recommend checking them out at least a few times!",

The atmosphere is really fun, servers are super friendly and food is soooo good.  And trivia is free to play!   Here are our favorite dishes: - Onion rings (very greasy, but that's how I like them!) -Pretzel bites  -Pepperoni pizza (crust is homemade!!) -Ahi tuna salad  -Beer cheese soup (it sounds strange but is sooo good) -Fried Oreos (duh)  Here's what I would skip: -Chicken fingers (always kind of dry and unexciting) -Fish and chips (same problem as the chicken fingers, and malt vinegar served in a spray bottle...) -Spaghetti pizza (too weird) -Mac and Cheese (it's verrrryyy richhhhh.  So try it if you like that sort of thing)  Also they have a HUGE selection of alcohol, but I can't comment on it because I don't drink.  I'm sure it's good.",

Great place to come for beer and delicious food to go along with it our food was gone to fast to take a picture, maybe next time. The other location does not have their kitchen open all night so another reason to come to this location! No matter what time of night we come in, we are welcomed with a smile! We are currently on our way back to Vegas and we know where our first stop will be. Make sure Joe is working when you go :)",

    "text": "Tonight happened to be Trivia Night and a few of my friends were going.  Tons of beer on tap, they frown upon you ordering Bud Light.  I wasn't really in the mood to spend a ton, so I elected to get a few Bud Lights.  My friend ordered the Chicken Strips and said they were decent.  Another friend of mine ordered the Steak Wrap and said it was okay.  So there's nothing. Special about the food judging from their reactions.  Trivia itself was fun, but took almost 3 hours to complete.  The inside ambiance is a little weird die to HUGE tables that you have to share.  It's a little awkward when your party of 4 belly's up to another random party of 4.  As for the service, it was good but something weird happened at the end.  My bill was $10 and I said I needed change for $100.  She brought back $90 with four $20's and a single $10 bill.  Hmmm, am I supposed to tip 100% of my bill?  Seems like a bizarre way to make change.  This is my second time coming here, but my first review.  I'm sticking with my guns here and rating it 3 stars.  Probably not coming back.  Thanks, but no thanks.",

    "text": "My new favorite spot for beer drinking has just been found.  As you may or may not know I enjoy great beer.  No Bud, Miller, or Coors for me.  Real beer is not light yellow when it pours. Just saying!  Aces & Ales has at least 40 taps of all micro and craft beers.  Every style of beer is available Stouts, Barleywine, Lagers, and of course IPA's.  I was totally impressed with their beer selection.  Another great feature is that they also carry rare and expensive Lambics and Gueuze in large magnum size bottles.  These types of beers you can cellar like a fine wine and have their flavors improve overtime.  I cannot wait to get a large group together for a tasting at this place.    My friend and I ordered some food at the bar while we were sipping the delicious brews.  He had what looked to be a delicious burger that was stuffed with all kinds of spicy stuff like jalapenos and pepperjack cheese.  I went a different route with the fish and chips.  When I received my order I was slightly disappointed with the portion that was delivered.  Two 6oz chunks was all that was brought so I inquired about the portion.  The bartender expressed her concerns with the portion and offered to bring out more with a charge I found out later.  We were able to resolve the issue in an  amicable manner.  Kim was a great and friendly bartender.  The food was decent.  however I will be back for the 5 star beer of course.  Many of there recipes seemed to incorporate beer in some form or fashion in the menu descriptions.  Very nice.  I will be back and hope to organize a big drink fest since this palce is open 24 hours. Sunday they have all taps on special for only $5.00.",

The waitress never offered to sell another drink when the drink glasses were visibly empty. Then finally after following her around the bar and asking for a drink #22 I think, she says ok I'll bring it. Sometime passes and waitress never comes back, so said waitress is asked about missing drink. Waitress replies \"oh we are out of that drink.\" And walks away.  Waitress is then tracked again to get drink. Probably will not be revisit this establishment since the Bartender wasn't too helpful but at least he was busy.",

Best bet is to go with the flight, letting you pick six beers, each a 4oz pour, for $16. Bar staff is friendly, several TVs to watch whatever game you're into.  But you may want to eat elsewhere. BF ordered the Juicy Lucy, said it was just alright, overcooked. Side of house fries is seasoned nicely. I opted for the Arrogant Bastard Steak Salad, much hyped by Tony T. It's an ample portion of meat, and I liked the dressing, but felt there were only minimal greens- maybe this is a salad best ordered by guys who don't like salads.    In addition to putting out average food, kitchen staff is slow- took 30+ minutes to get our orders, and we were the only ones eating. Now we know why. At $13/dish, plus the $16 flight, and tip, total was $50. Didn't really have the quality to justify the pricing, can have better for less at other bars around town.",

During the spring/summer they open the patio doors which makes it even better. They also carry a large selection of beers, which makes your stay even more enjoyable!! The decor is nice and modern, it's definitely different from your typical PT's. The food is good for a bar. We ordered the cheese curds which were awesome. The melted cheese was also good, but it was not the best ever like some of the reviews make you believe. Lastly, we ordered some chicken nachos which were very average and would probably not order them again. Overall. A good place to come and watch some games close to home!",

There is plenty of seating, and a large patio as well.  There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said. Mainly, to compare it to the original - this location has many more taps, a patio and quite a bit more seating (plus the patio). Those all equal a great time!  The servers are friendly and knowledgeable and will provide recommendations if you need help deciding.  Just as with the other location, the food is pretty damn good.  My only complaint was that our cheese curds tasted like lettuce, since they were served on a bed of greens. Both of us commented that it kind of ruined the flavor of the cheese balls.

I'm not a beer drinker, so my review is primarily based on the food and atmosphere. Their list of beers is impressive, mostly because of the sheer quantity, but so many were tapped out that night. Otherwise, everyone that ordered beer seemed to enjoy themselves. They also do flights or tastings, which is a great way to try several new beers!  The atmosphere is just like every neighborhood bar in town. Bar in the center, half booth seating around the exterior, dark, a few TVs, and lots of smoke. It was really clean, but I found it difficult to enjoy while smoke from the bar found its way to overwhelm me at the booth. We had a wonderful server (I wish I could remember her name) and she was with us for most of the evening. Another server took over at the very end of our duration (after checks were settled, etc) and she seemed to want to ignore us.  The food is not very good. I've seen many reviews mention this fact and you'd be wise to heed it. Of course, I needed to try it for myself (and you might feel the same way). We ordered Bacon Cheddar Fries ($8), French Fries ($5), and Chicken Tenders ($9). The fries were all right, but the bacon and cheese were not worth the extra $3. The cheese was not \"smothered\" like the menu claimed and very dry. The chicken tenders were decent. All white breast meat, moist, and nice buttermilk breading (fried). Both dishes came with their ranch dip that was really thin and didn't have much flavor.  Come for the craft beers, eat somewhere else.",

It seems over the last year the food selection has diminished and the service has suffered a little bit. This last Saturday really bummed me out. I had 5 Moscow Mules (at $10 each) in two hours and didn't even get buzzed. I'm not a big drinker, so that amount of alcohol should have done something. After the 3rd drink and not tasting or feeling anything, I asked the waitress if there was alcohol in it, she said that she watched the bartender pour Smirnoff in it. Smirnoff... in a $10 drink... lol Done with this place. So yeah, $60 later, with tip, and I'm stone sober.",

I ordered the Alaskan White wheat ale, a bowl of beer cheese soup, and a steak sandwich marinated in beer. Maybe I went a little beer nuts with all the beer orders but each was very tasty and good.   Service was decent, only mix up was bringing wrong plates of food to our party. We almost got someone else's beer and food as well.   I'd come back as it looks like the menu has improved since my first visit here just after they opened. I do miss the Capt. Crunch French Toast that is no longer on the menu.",

Then...there is Aces and Ales on Tenaya. It's the premiere beer bar in Las Vegas.  With over 50 different rotating taps, it's hard to get bored of the selection. Aces and Ales tends to get special kegs as well that aren't available anywhere else in town from such breweries as Stone, Green Flash, and Epic.  Aces and Ales is also know for their beer themed events. Every Tuesday is TNT in which you can get a sampler of a beer inspired food along with 6 4oz tasters of beer for $20. Thursday Nights they partner with local radio jockey Jason Mahoney from Xtreme Radio 107.5 and have special drink/beer prices. Outside of those weekly events, Aces has tap take overs constantly along with Local Brewery events.  The food here is amazing pub food. The Pizzas are some of the best in town and the cooks are willing to be very creative with your pizza orders.   All around, this is THE beer spot to stop in Las Vegas",

If you're new to the craft beer scene, have them recommend you something.  Everyone starts somewhere- Lagers, Pilsners, Stouts, Ciders...try something new.  They seem to have some special thing going on every night; Tuesday/Thursday night tastings (TNT) where they pair a gourmet food item with beer, Black Market crash Sundays (Refill your growler for half? price and cheap beer that day), and I'm sure with age, we'll see tap takeovers. If your into gambling or sports, they do have a bar full of machines and tv's all around.

    "text": "Got a Groupon and had been wanting to try the food here so the hubby and I ventured over here for a Friday night dinner.  After reading the reviews I was worried that we may be in for a long night.  We arrived around 7p and sat on the kitchen side.  There were a couple of tables occupied and three waitresses buzzing around.  As soon as we sat down, a waitress told us someone will be right with us.  And we waited.  I don't know if I am old school but I seem to remember a 30 second meet and greet back in the day.  This meant that within 30 seconds of you sitting down, someone was bringing you water, menu and saying hi.  Finally someone brought some menus and shortly after that our waitress came and asked us if we had any questions and I quickly ordered waters,  Boneless Wings and Zucchini Chips.  She came back shortly there after and took our food orders:  burger for the hubby and Shocke grilled cheese for me.  The food came out very quickly with just the right amount of time between the apps and main.  On to the food.  The boneless wings were not the greatest thing ever, but they were good in the fact that they were not some previously frozen thickly breaded boneless \"where's the chicken\" bite.  They were actual pieces of chicken with a very light, but crispy coat and not overly sauced.  Good in my book.  My zucchini was good as well.  I really prefer the breadcrumb style fried zucchini-this was coated in a beer battered style-good, but this in my opinion makes for a greasy cold mess if you don't eat them at the speed of light!  Hubby's burger was just your average bar burger, but tasted pretty good.  He is a fan of FAtburger and always says Fat is better.  My grilled cheese however was pretty disappointing.  Sourdough bread with one piece of provolone, roasted red peppers, jalapeno's (freshly cut-not jar), and bacon.  I could have made this at home and it would have been killer!  It was just lacking...cheese, maybe?  If I order a specialty grilled cheese I think it should be pretty darn cheesy!    Anyway, our server was good, quick and attentive and hopefully more people will have this kind of experience and live to tell the tale....  Go try it...let me know ;)",

    "text": "Staying at the nearby LaQuinta, we wanted something close and unique.  Aces & Ale is both -- it's literally across the street and the menu is eclectic, with salads,  sandwiches,  and pizza.   Since the place specializes in beer,  I ordered a flight (4 for $10) -- 2 Porters and 2 IPAs. I told the server to surprise me.  I wasn't disappointed.  The first IPA, Stone Captain Ostrich Trellis, had a nice flavor with a touch of citrus.   Next I tried the Left Hand Death Before Disco porter, which was very smooth with no bitterness at all in the aftertaste.  The Coronado Marine Dream (an IPA) had more of an after bite than the Captain Ostrich Trellis, which I preferred.   The final porter, the  High Water Campfire Stout with Coffee, was very dark but only had the slightest hint of the promised coffee flavor.   Overall, all of the beers were outstanding, worthy of a place that makes beer a central part of their menu.   For an appetizer, we tried the Deep Fried Deviled Eggs ($8), which involves deep frying a boiled egg and adding a mixture of avocado and the yolks on top. I was surprised at how good it was, simultaneously crunchy and creamy. My only complaint is that there were only 4 halves. I could eaten a lot more.   For the actual meal, we're decided to share the Eddie Spaghetti, which is actually a 16 inch deep dish pizza with spaghetti as one of the ingredients ($20).  In addition to the spaghetti, there is a generous supply of cheese and thickly sliced sausage on top.    You think,  \"Nah,  it can't work.\" But it does. Until today,  \"spaghetti\" and \"pizza\" were never in the same thought, other than as the answer to the trivia question, \"Name two foods originally from Italy?\" But not together as ONE dish. Yet it works.   The only critique is that it is only available as a 16\" large. Way too much one and almost too much for two people to eat in one sitting. We took half a pizza back to the hotel to snack on.   The servers were attentive, friendly and very helpful.  Our particular server was only on her second day but her personality bodes well for a long and successful career if that is what she wants. Her supervisor was equally friendly. They complimented an already excellent dining experience.  Out of the way in Summerlin (though there is apparently another location near Nellis), it is well worth the trip.  This may be the best brew pub in Las Vegas. You won't be disappointed.",

First the environment is cool. Tons of TVs, seemed to be plenty of room, great draft selection, and they have a patio. I didn't sit on the patio, but it was packed so others were taking advantage.  Too hot for me :).   I ordered some food and it was ok. Nothing horrible.  I got the shaved prime rib sandwich. The only thing wrong with it was the amount of grizzle in the meat. Again, nothing horrible and the only thing that stuck out. All in all, a good place to visit.   One thing to note. They allow smoking throughout the restaurant. For those of you that don't care about that, Cool. If that does bother you, then you may want to consider a different spot.",

The eggs were fine. I also got a growler (empty) to hopefully come back and have filled.  I sat at the bar, and although all the beer was tempting, I stuck with coffee. They even made it fresh and it was better than I expected from a poker bar. They have one of my fave video poker games, Power Aces, and I was a winner at that with very little effort. That paid for the Groupon many times over. They have many beer events such as Stone Brewing tap takeovers, a Strong Beer Festival and the like. Great selection of beers and the menu is quite extensive also. The patio looked nice and although this isn't my neighborhood, I was impressed enough to consider returning.",

Waitress never came by to let us know what was going on but it was clear they were having issues with the staff since they were constantly yelling at the cook. By the time our food finally was given to us it was cold and poorly made. They also claimed to not have a certain item we had ordered but people after us received it? Made no sense!! It was such a horrible experience on our first night in town! Absolutely nothing was worth the time we spent there!",

Although, we have always had a great time and enjoy your food and drinks, this visit was \"hands down\" the best service we have ever received. Our server Jazzy was not only friendly and funny but was very attentive to our needs and our drinks and food were served promptly. She even took the time to learn the names on all our separate checks, which made it easier on all of us. The other server Jessica B was also running around with a smile on her face making sure everyone had what they needed as well.   I also observed a very busy bartender/manager Kim, hustling behind the bar with two busy girls, Helen and Stephanie. They were killing it back there.  Kim was all over the place selling football squares, announcing the raffle winners, running to and from the bar and kitchen and still had time to check on us and make sure we were all having an amazing time. It's nice to see a manager all pumped up, motivating the staff and enjoying her job.  The jalapeno bacon Mac and cheese was fire!!! I will definitely order it again.   We will definitely be back sooner than later. Thank you Kim B for your hard work and dedication",

Especially since I am not much help with in the random knowledge department. I'll still make my presence known with a few drinks though.   The food is typical greasy bar food. The nachos are lackluster. The Juicy Lucy and the Rueben are rather delicious though. Most of the items that come out of the fryer has a pool of oil on the bottom of the plate.

    "text": "**UPDATED** If you like craft beer, you absolutely need to make a stop here. Lots of great craft brews on tap and even some \"on nitro\" that give it that creamy Guinness-like mouth-feel. THey have a lot of great vintage beers like Vertical Epics dating back to 2005.   I've yet to order a meal here but the appetizers are a must.  The Arrogant Bastard Onion Rings are exactly how I remembered from the early days of The Stone Bistro and Gardens but my True love is the deep fried cheese curds. The wings are fantastic but I wish they had an extremely hot version.   On a particularly busy night we had some issues with getting the waitress' attention and getting our order in a timely fashion. She was aware of the issue and gave us some beer on the house. Much appreciated. All of the other times we went they did fantastic, so no complaints. This is my go-to spot now. -- UPDATE: I've been here many times since and have ordered meals and have been very pleased. The pizzas are top notch. Never had an issue with service since even when we're alone on the patio. This is now my go-to spot. So much so that when we decided on a place for a monthly meetup for our group we unanimously chose this place and haven't even entertained the possibility of moving it elsewhere.",

The dressing on the salad was a very good pairing with the ahi, I finished it so fast that I wish it were bigger. The women at the bar seemed to kind of brush me off, probably because they knew I wasn't staying long, I assume. I really enjoyed everything I had ordered I just wish I had felt comfortable enough to ask the ladies behind the bar some questions about the beers on tap, but they weren't very welcoming. BUT, I will continue to come back because I absolutely love this bar.",

They have a ton of craft beers, at least 50 on tap, and also offer many really good selections in the bottle as well. You can check out their website and see the beer lists just to get an idea of what you could be tasting.   We swung through on our way to catch a flight home (the round about path to the airport...and kill time with nothing left to do). I wish I had a few more days and hours to burn away sipping through the entire selection. I also tried the food here and it was certainly good but what will have me returning is the selection. I always find it hard to get good beer in Vegas but now I know where to turn!",

(hungry and grumpy)   ...  UPDATE..  They did give me an extra piece of fish...  that was considerate.  UPDATE 2... Actually they ended up bringing another order...  So 4 fish and lots of fries...

Tables are huge, easily seating 8 or more people.  We then sat for about 15 minutes until someone came to check on us. Waitress then took our drink order and we got our drinks about 5 minutes later.   She then did not return for another 10 minutes or so.  Finally place our order.  We ordered an appetizer and two entrees.  Got our appetizer about 15 minutes after we ordered it.  The entrees it not come out till at least 30 minutes after ordering.   So we basically got our food after an hour of waiting....:(  and it was not really that busy.   Food was ok, but fries were EXTRA crispy.  Probably will not be back.

This place is new and therefore the staff is probably new so we will try again but not a good first impression.",

    "text": "Aces & Ales has a wonderful craft beer selection. It also has a nice layout, with ample TV screens inside to watch sporting events and a really good patio area (only lacking a few TVs to take it to the next level). However, the food is dreadful and the service (based on one visit) is not much better. Out of five of us, one liked (and nothing more than \"liked\") their food. The service was not very attentive. When she got around to asking us if we liked our food (after we were all done eating), we replied with a less than enthusiastic response, one in which she did not seem to care much about. Also, a little personality goes a long way and often makes up (at least a little) for lackluster service. Our server's personality could be called tofu. With the beer selection and swell set-up, it is very disappointing that A&A cannot deliver on the food and service. (I suppose we should have listened to our one friend in the group that had been here before and had a similar experience.) Maybe if your pound enough craft beers their food and service seems remarkable. I guess that is my advice: Get hammered and then have the time of your life at A&A. If you are anything less than tipsy, take in something with flavor and service - Wine 5 Cafe is just up the road.",

Waitress was nice and gave a sample of beer in question, which ultimately ended up with another beer purchase.   Where the dinner started falling apart is in the kitchen.  I ordered a stuffed burger medium well.  The burger was raw, and the waitress even commented about how raw the burger was and would send it back.  Apparently this happened several times this night as she said she had to send several burgers back.  When my burger finally comes back out after another 20 minutes, it didn't come with any aioli.  Additionally they gave me regular fries on the 3rd attempt instead of sweet potato fries.    I didn't have time to try and get it right as we spent 1.5 hours getting food and already had plans and needed to quickly go.  I had to leave after only eating a small portion of my food as I was running late for our next obligation. Sadly, a place I was really looking forward to trying ending up being a place I will never go back to.",

They will give you suggestions on what they recommend depending on what you like.  The mac and cheese is delicious as well. The pizza is just like pizza anywhere else.  No Hendricks available though, but do try their breakfast shot! Half and half shot of Jameson and Butterscotch Snapps with a shot of orange juice as a chaser and then you get a piece of bacon to eat after that. You'll want more than one!",

    "text": "I know how a poor Islamic Pilgrim feels when they pray at Mecca now.   This Majestic wonderland is split into two significant sections: a fairly casual bar area with numerous flat-screens and an amazing amount of taps. Your eyes will quickly find the flat screens with the up to date lists and serving varieties of the masterfully chosen beer (seriously, I've only seen one beer there that looked like it wasn't artfully chosen. It was a Cherry Blue Moon or some such thing.) There's so many amazing beers that it's actually hard to see them on the screen from the back of the bar.. And I have spectacular vision. The other section is a Lovely combination of Hogwarts Dining Hall and a San Diego Beer Bar. Slightly brighter lighting, high tables and a beautiful view of the Keg Room. Tons of room for everyone here. This is the section I did not sit in and plan to on my next visit. The food I had was glorious: Crunchy balanced Arrogant Bastard Fries with an expertly assembled burger. So Good. Service was spectacular as well. The beer menu was said to be out of date but I have no idea how they could keep them up to date. Hence the flat screens. One excellent idea: The beers are all six bucks: they are just served in different portions. The servers claim this is because of alcohol content (which is True: good beer is correlated to higher alcohol content) but we know what's up. Still six bucks per beer is really fantastic. It really cannot be overemphasized that this is the best selection of beer anywhere in Vegas. I honestly don't know where you're going to find a better diversity of ales and lagers. You're definitely going to need a jet to get there, wherever it might be.  I hope that my fellow motorists, my family, and my insurance company appreciate how hard it is to stop drinking at this amazing temple of hops and barley. I do not believe in drinking and driving but I was pretty damn close to finding a homeless person to drive me home.

It's conveniently located for those of us in the NW part of town and offers a good selection of beers not found easily at other watering holes in town.  We came here on a Tuesday night, found seats in the patio area, and quickly found the ambience rather loud, largely due to the trivia night shenanigans going on inside.  Our group had to shout to \"communicate\" with each other; this was rather disappointing when we were all sitting at the same table.  It would have been nice if the PA system was off during our visit; we felt like we were forced to participate in the surround-sound trivia game because we literally could not escape it!  On the bright side, the food was good and service was pleasant and my company was congenial.  Beer prices seemed high; for instance, my husband ordered the Green Flash Stout, which came in a smaller-than-usual glass (not a full pint, perhaps half a pint?) and was $8 (before tip and tax).  I'll have to check out Tenaya Brewing Company up the street to compare brews and prices.",

I had gotten a gift certificate for them a while back and thought this would be a good time to enjoy it. The food and the drinks were great as always. I know this because Myself and about 10 to 13 teachers go there every Friday for happy hour. So I had called ahead to make sure the gift certificate was still good because it was so old and u was informed that if it doesn't have and expiration date on it it's good, which it did not. So once I arrived at the bar I again asked the gentleman who had first come over if the certificate was good, he looked at it and said it was fine. A few friends had come by and I purchased a bunch of appetizers for the table so I didn't let the gif certificate go to waist. The bill came I gave the certificate and the waitress came back and told me the manager said it was no good because they no longer did business with that radio station. I asked to speak with the manager and she said same thing and I told her that I was told by two of her staff that it was good, however she still refused to honor it. All I can say is because she refused to honor a $50 gift certificate, she lost around $500 because we have now decided to move out Friday after school happy hour some where else, which is a shame because we had such a great time there. I hope the owner of this place reads these and realizes that the actions of one general manager just coast them money and deals with the situation..",

I thought an appetizer was suppose to come before the meal.  After I was finished eating I flagged the waitress down and told her I had a Groupon.  She said I couldn't use it because it was for two people.  I pulled up the Groupon which said nothing about being for two people.  So, I flagged her down again and showed it to her, she finally agreed to let me use it but you could tell she wasn't very happy about it.  Throughout my meal I could tell I didn't have the right body parts to get good service.  She was very attentive (if not overly) to the male customers but she barely acknowledged me through my whole meal.  Anytime I wanted something I felt like I had to wave her down.  Also, I noticed three of the waitress' drinking alcohol while they were working.  One drank out of a customer's glass and two others were taking shots offered by male customers.  I find this totally unprofessional and I am surprised management allows this.  I probably will not be going back which is unfortunate because it is so hard to find restaurants who have Woodchuck on draft but I really prefer to be treated better especially if I'm paying money.",

    "text": "If I could give half star ratings, this would get 4 1/2 stars. Not a whole lot to say about this place really. They serve classic bar food, with a few unexpected options (quite a good variety of mac and cheese options). Decided to start with the fried cheese curds, which were bite sized bliss (but c'mon, it's deep fried cheese....whats not to love?). For the starter, decided to go with the Juicy Lucifer, which was a beef and bacon patty stuffed with pepper jack cheese and jalapenos. Now I love spicy food, but this is not for the faint of heart. Thank God I had an ice cold beer to wash it down...which brings me to the best part about this place: their beer selection is INSANE. They have quite an impressive selection, some of which are nitrogen-tapped (which is awesome!). All in all, this place is great and makes me wish I had a place like this within driving distance of where I lived. PS- Only knock I can give this place is that the onion rings (which were very tasty and battered with Arrogant Bastard beer batter) were greasy as hell. I know onion rings tend to be heavier on the grease, but this was a tad much.",

Stayed off the strip at a La Quitna in Summerlin off of a street called Tenaya. Little did I know there was a GEM right across the street from our hotel called Aces and Ales.It was Saturday afternoon and thought lets go get a drink and see what the place is like. WOW that is all I could say my husband and I walked in and right away was greeted by everyone not to many people in the bar sat at the bar gambled a little and got all the drinks that we wanted so fast. I do not remember our bar tenders name but she was AWESOME!!!!! (Makes a GREAT Tanqueray and Tonic). Ended up staying there for about 2 1/2 hours just talking to her and and having a GREAT time. We ended up ordering food and OMG!!!! it was SOOOOO good the chicken strips and fries are AMAZING!!! Next time in Las Vegas I will FOR SURE make a point to stop in and have a another great afternoon.",

But as I explained to them, I have been in this place maybe 5 times and every time the customer service has been 100% and the food and OMG the beers all amazing every time. And I am a crappy customer. I will wait until people buy food so I can sneak a little and try everything before committing. But everything is always good. Tonight, another A+ night so I had to leave a YELP review. They took care of us and they were so adorable, as we left they gave us a FREE water bottle because we were complaining about having to go out in the heat. When I was done drinking, my water glass was never empty. As soon as my fork and napkin hit my plate they snatched it up. They just GET IT DONE. I love this place. If you love GOOD beer and good food and you love SUPERIOR (practically NON existent) Customer Service then this is your bar. I can't wait it for it to cool down a little so I can be planted outside because their outside patio rocks too! Thanks Matt and Austin. You rock!!!",

One time I ordered a beer, thought it was great so ordered it again. Had to waive down a different person only to hear that the beer I \"ordered\" had been out.

Went in there around 12am it was pretty much empty other than a couple at the bar and group of guys at a table. Sat down at the bar put a $20 into the machine played that no one came by to greet me or give me a menu. Played a little more still no one came by. No beer. No menu. No hello. I'm consider myself a patient person but after 10 mins I just walked out. Pretty ridiculous for having 2 guys and a girl behind the bar at once. All good tho I won't be back ..

Had a blonde lady take our order on food and got our drinks. While we were eating we noticed that the lady disappeared and never came back to our table. I guess she got off of work, but we never informed of the change of servers, which would have been a nice gesture for a place that isn't really packed much normally. While we were waiting no one came around to check on us at all. We had empty waters and no customer service. This bartender Joe with black spikey hair never checked on us, which really wasn't an uplifting feeling to a place I've brought a lot of business to. I'm pretty sure he was too consumed with talking with his friends who came to visit him at work; instead of tending to other paying customers, who are waiting on customer service and to get a check to pay for their drinks and meals. I won't be recommending people here anymore due to the lack of customer service that was showed at this bar and how unfriendly and unwelcoming we were treated during my time there. Please work on being aware of patrons in your bar and checking up on them.",

It's great that a location offers such a variety of hard to find gems. After arriving with a party of 5 it started bad from the go. After our server disappearing for 15 min we had to go to bar for refills and to track her down. Then  she informs us that she is leaving and transferring our bill to Rose but fails to inform Rose of our bill wich was divided by 2 parties. We decided to bail on this place after so many of our friends and followers have spoken highly on your establishment. Our check comes and nothing had been split or done in the manner that was asked then both  the bartender and server begin to bad mouth and berate the server that bailed on us. A total lack of professional on there part. We travel to CA. on a regular basis to purchase what u carry and I almost found a great place to spend $$$$ at but after last night I'll happily take a 3hr drive then deal with this again. It's a shame how quickly 1 employe can cost your business  this much money in the long run. I hope things change before they cost you more.",

The selection of brews was nice, we were all able to find something that interested us and that we enjoyed. The selection ranged through about 50 beers on tap and had 2 ciders on tap. The waitress wasn't too knowledgable on the beers but one of bartenders there were. When the keg blew on the first beer that one of us ordered they gave us the half cup of beer and he was able to pick one at no charge. My boyfriend enjoyed that beer so asked her for something similar and she had no idea so had to ask. As we enjoyed our beers we quickly ordered the fried zucchini and onion rings. Both were arrogant bastard ail from stone brewery based battering. These were very good. We proceeded with a much needed lunch and I ordered the arrogant bastard stead wrap. This was delicious. wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, a healthy helping of stead with balsamic vinaigrette, if i wasn't full from the appetizers i would have devoured the whole thing. I would definitely suggest getting this. They also have it in salad and sandwich form if you are not big on wraps.",

She would come and ask what we needed or if we were ready to order but then rushed off without allowing us time to really answer her question. Also, the glass of wine I had was warm as if it just came out of the bottle. I took the drink back to the bar and a very nice lady assisted me and said she would bring a new glass when the wine had chilled a bit. The pizza was very good which is why I am giving a 2 stars but the chicken was just ok. The friend I came with for her birthday has said she has come here before and the service was never that bad.",

I went for pub quiz last night, and my group planned on staying and drinking for a while, but our server just dropped the bill off and left, with three rounds still left in trivia!  The happy hour menu is good, but the prices for the quality of most of the menu is ridiculous. The best thing is the onion rings, everything else is mediocre at best. The nachos are horrible. One little layer of chips with gross cheese and a few pieces of chicken or steak. On multiple occasions they've gotten my order wrong, and take the cheapest way out to fix it. They brought the wrong kind of pizza, and all they did to fix it was take it back to the kitchen, take the toppings off and put new ones on, then brought it back to our table without even warming it.   I'll keep coming back for happy hour, the beer selection, and trivia every now and then, but like I said, I really want it to be THE spot, but I always have to wait until I forget the disappointment  to venture back.",

    "text": "Aces & Ales is definitely a local bar you want to visit if you're in search of craft beers on draft.  This locations boasts up to 50 beers on tap at any given time.  A neat feature of this bar are the TV's that list all draft beers along with pertinent information: type of beer, alcohol content, brewery, and amount of beer left in each keg.  If none of the 50 beers appeal to you (you'd have to be quite picky to not find something you like) they have a large bottled selection as well.  Few bars in town can compare to Aces & Ales' broad selection.  Outside of drinks, they have a full kitchen serving up sandwiches, chili, burgers, nachos...all the types of food you can expect from a bar.  Much of the food is also fried, so be prepared to deal with that; the amount of oil can be overwhelming.  The best thing I've had here has been the Juicy Lucy, a burger stuffed with cheese.  Outside of that, I can't say that I necessarily look forward to eating here.  Also of note is that onTuesdays at 8:00pm, there is a weekly pub quiz hosted by Geeks Who Drink.  It lasts 1.5 - 2 hours, and bar tabs are up for grabs for the 1st and 2nd place teams.  Come for the beer, stay for the pub quiz, but only order some food if you haven't already eaten.  Aces & Ales strives to cater towards craft beer enthusiasts, and they do an excellent job of that.",

I am not able to comment on the food because we never had the chance to try any. After being there for over an hour we had enough. Do yourself a favor and go to Big Dogs brewing just down the street.

It is always a good time, good food, and overall good environment! The owner is also a good man and makes the environment fun for the staff. They have events such as chili cook offs and invite local residents to come taste them for free of course and pick your favorite! Definitely recommend!! Definitely one of my favorites!

We ordered the nachos and candied bacon. Both were very sub par. The nachos were beyond basic. Cheese, sour cream, and salsa. Similar to something I would make drunk at home at 3am. Candied bacon was more like sweet jerky. Tasted good, but needed to be crisper.  The beer is hard to review because they rotate taps every three days. From the 6 we tried, only one was really good. Maybe we were just here for a bad rotation?  The saving grace was the customer service and overall ambiance. Our waitress Summer was awesome, and the other staff seemed friendly as well. She was a great conversationalist and very friendly. Also the bar wasn't packed or super noisy (we went at 9pm on a Saturday). Good place to hang out with friends and actually hear each other well enough to carry on a conversation.   We weren't crazy about the place, but we might try it again.",

They have a good choice of craft beers in Las Vegas and better selection of quality beers. The waitress says the beers on tap on the menu changes every three days. They also do events so check their website for current tap list and special events.  If you like video poker then this is also a very ok place to hang out.  They have a discount at happy hour.  I had a glass of Riesling. My friends had Nachos and cheese. We tried Candied bacon, it tasted like Teriyaki bacon and we didn't like it.   The music was loud and noise level was high.  Our waitress is very attentive and friendly.  Overall, this is a pretty average bar. I don't feel like there's a real reason to go out of your way to come here, but if you're in the area then it's worth a visit.",

When the places has 8 + IPAs, it would help if she could distinguish between each brew.   Food wise, we ordered the pretzel and Buffalo chicken Mac and cheese.

After the situation with Brandie and using a free drink card, should have been very focused, but far from it.   Good luck Adam! I'm continuing school for Business/Management, this is not right!! You have really bad quality servers!!   PS:  Your free drink cards DONT mention anything about only comping \"pint\" beers. It says \"Enjoy a beer on us with any food or alcohol purchase.\"  Come on!! You've got to be kidding me man. I hear from your ex co worker that you called me a liar about my story. Wrong!! Didn't lie about anything. I was honest there was an altercation or two between my girlfriend and I and a bartender that should have never happened and has never happened anywhere else we've been.  This isn't a \"me\" problem, this is an Aces and Ales problem.  Just because you have a lot of customers, many who don't feel like complaining when they ARE wronged, including me, doesn't mean everything.

Spotty service but good food and tons of screens for football season; along with raffles and specials during games.  Unfortunately on my last experience I questioned whether I could continue to patronize this business. I came in September for the Falcons/raiders game. My husband is a die hard Falcons fan, I'm a 49er fan, and we brought a friend who is a Seahawks fan.  To paint the picture: my husband and I were simply wearing our team hats and our buddy was decked out with a hawks jersey.  I was personally heckled twice while watching this game.  One man stood up to leave furious and stopped upon seeing me. He pointed at me and said 'I THOUGHT THIS WAS A F***ING RAIDERS BAR' and stormed out. Maybe 20 minutes later a guy two tables down picked me out and said 'hey! Hey you!' And flipped me the bird.  We stayed and finished the game. Paid our bill and tipped well but this has been enough to deter me from potentially coming back.",

    "text": "Aces and Ales is my #1 draft pick in Summerlin.  They are a welcomed cold and tasty addition to the neighborhood.  When we're here getting our drank on, it's like Phil from Duck Dynasty says, \"Everybody happay, happay, happay.\"    Aces is located on the corner of Tenaya and Peak, a couple doors down from Tenaya Creek.  They're in a stand alone building with green shutters around the top.  If you're driving down Peak, signage is sparse.    With over 50 craft beer handles, there's something to satisfy every beer palate from chocolatey stouts to crazy IPAs to dubbel tripel belgians to you name it.  As soon as one tap kicks it, they already have a replacement plan.  On Sundays Aces offers half off growler fills until 8pm.  Don't be afraid to ask for a sample if you're not sure which beer is going to make your tongue sing and wag happily.  For best service, pull up a seat at the bar.  Our favorite bartenders Coleen and Adonna are amazeballs; freaking love them!  They are super friendly and prompt, taking care of your every need, err beer.  You might recognize Adonna, who was formerly with Sierra Gold down the street.    We've tried sitting in the dining room a couple of times, but service was meh to non-existent.    Don't forget to grub.  When you're throwing back the high ABV beers, sooner or later you will need to please the hunger that dwells within.  We've tried a wide variety of items from their menu, and have yet to stumble across anything that we wouldn't order again.  Maybe I'm crazy, but I think their pizza dough/crust tastes better than at the Nellis location.  Keep an eye out for Aces on Groupon.  Occasionally, they have half-off offers that are redeemable both food and/or drinks.  Their Groupon offers ARE location specific though.",

We also tried the cheese curds, they came with 3 sides - one was buffalo sauce the other was a ranch and there was another one that I can't remember right now. Since we did take out the food was a little cold when we got home but that's our fault. I really enjoyed the mac and cheese and he seemed to enjoy the pastrami sandwich even though he said the bread was a little rough. We both really liked the cheese curds and the buffalo sauce was our favorite dipping sauce for them.   If you are going to do take out I would suggest calling 25 to 30 minutes earlier than anticipated pickup time because they can get a little bit busy. I've been in here to eat several times and the service is always excellent!",

A lot of amazing brews on tap that were absolutely amazing!  The atmosphere was great and the service was stellar! I cannot remember the name of the lady who worked our table but she was awesome! I purchased an Old Guardian Barleywine to go in a bottle and the manager noticed it had some settlement in the bottom of the bottle, so he upgraded me and my friend's bottle to a year older without extra charge. Now that's customer service and attention to detail.  The only reason why I cannot give it five stars is because while their bottle selection is stellar, I mean, they have a Woot Stout there from 2017, I believe, it is a little overpriced in my opinion. There was a Firehouse Blonde Barleywine in a bottle that I wanted oh so bad but I couldn't fathom paying $40 I think it was for a 16oz bottle. Otherwise, I cannot wait to come back for their stuff on tap! Kudos to management and staff!",

That I can definitely appreciate, so we'll be giving the place another chance.  They do have a good selection of rotating craft beers, so don't miss out on the opportunity to try some new things.",

Our server was Karen she was really nice & helped us pick out our flight of  beers. I originally tried to wing it but couldn't figure out what to pick. I don't know much about beer so She helped us picked #3 artic dust it was a pale ale  #18 occidental - Hefeweizen tasted like pears to me #38 north coast - golden ale my favorite and #49 left hand - blond with a taste of raspberry, it's an acquired taste. All in all I loved 3 out 4 she helped us pick, which really shows she knew her stuff.   The menu had pretty typical bar style food to choose from but don't let that fool you, the food was so good. We ordered boneless chicken wings, jalapeno Mac and  beer batter fish and chip. Just Like I said before everything was so good but the fish and chips took the cake for me.   Just recently we visited Huntington Beach and stopped at a local place and left completely disappointed.... but aces and Ales really made up for what I was missing.   Karen really made our experience pleasant, she knew what to recommend and seem to genuinely love her job. After we paid our bill she made sure to let us know about future events coming up and we are now excited to try mimosas on Sunday",

I only wish I didn't have to work later so I could have enjoyed a few more beers.  Justine was our server and she was amazing! I had the buffalo boneless wings with fries and my mom had a standard cheeseburger. We both loved our food. It was plentiful, fresh, and well-seasoned.   They had 50 beers on tap and I tried the Modern Times Radium Dial. Get it if they have it! It was delicious! When I mentioned that I'd have to track some down, she tipped me off to a few stores that may carry it and even let me know about a craft beer Facebook group for women. She really knows her stuff!

I play keno at the bar and order a few drinks and almost always leave having met someone new or tried some sort of sample they are handing out. It's a very local feel here and the slots are loose. I stayed one time during the week to meet my husband after work and they started karaoke as well. So fun!!   The bartenders here are friendly and they almost always help me to remember my loyalty information without seeming to be annoyed (I'm sure they get asked for help constantly).  The food is really good as well and I'm surprised by the amount of vegetarian options on a bar food type of menu. I appreciate the local feel here and whenever I'm in the area, I have no problem swinging by to have a couple drinks and play keno.",

    "text": "This isn't the original location, but it might just be better.  Aces & Ales started as a bar in a quiet neighborhood on the east side, a spot that still draws plenty of locals and boasts 20 craft beer taps (give or take a Goose Island or two). This newer outpost on Tenaya dwarfs it with 50 taps. If you want a more varied selection of craft beers and distance isn't a concern, that's clearly a big selling post.  Also, most if not all of the annual events now take place here. Stone Domination, Strong Beer Fest, and others are always here and not at the one closer to me, likely to take advantage of the higher number of taps. And if anyone is curious, Strong Beer Fest leftovers are priced such that it might actually be worth it to pay the entry fee.  As with the Nellis site, happy hour is offered daily 4-6pm, except for Sundays when it's all day and grants 50% off growler fills. Pricing is $2 off apps and drinks (except for taster pours) and 50% off pizzas. This location also does \"Sinners Sundays\" brunch (9am-1pm, see web site for details).  I could go on and on about each individual beer in the multitude which I tried today with my friend. They were all served at an appropriate temperature, and flights (of up to 4 per flight holder, but price individually) were labeled by number to correspond with the menu (see web site for updated list). By the way, most beers run $6-8 for full pours ($2-$2.75 for 5 oz pours), although special event / rare beers will justifiably be priced higher.  Food is also really solid here.  - Bacon Bombs ($9, or $7 during happy hour): identified by our server as a particularly popular item. After I absentmindedly devoured them, I realized how addictive they were. Think bacon-wrapped jalapeno popper, and then realize how badly you want to order it.  - OG beer bites ($6 / $4): think fancy pizza crust balls with both marinara dip and beer cheese dip available. I wouldn't have ordered them on my own, but they worked well after downing a few alcoholic beverages.  - BBQ chicken pizza ($18 for 16-inch, $14 for 10-inch, half off at happy hour): surprising in that it wasn't overwhelming with BBQ sauce. Actually, I'm not even sure that there was typical BBQ sauce present. For the happy hour, it was a deliciously topped chicken pizza with a fairly crispy crust. For regular price, it would be decent.  It might be a daunting drive to get back here, but Aces & Ales Tenaya is now on my craft beer map for good. Aspiring craft beer explorers should definitely check out their happy hour.",

Beer, beer and more beer to choose from!! They have some beer there they brew and other beer that is imported in!!   The facility is comfortable and decorated accordingly to an upscale restaurant bar.  We enjoyed every moment of being there.  Bathrooms are on the dirtier side though.  They are nice big bathrooms just the floors are really dirty. A little bathroom cleaning will improve visits !!",

    "text": "Aces & Ales is a better-than-most neighborhood bar with tons of draft beer choices and above average food. Sadly I don't live close to here but it was perfect for a stop after hiking out at Mt. Charleston. We called ahead on a Sunday to make sure their patio allowed dogs and it does! We weren't sure how to actually get our dog to the patio since there isn't  an entrance from the outside but we just carried him through the bar (not sure how to do this with bigger dogs). Surprisingly we were the only ones on the patio but the bar area was packed. The waitress was very friendly and turned on the Golden Knights game for us outside.   We found out it was Happy Hour which includes $2 off draft beers and appetizers and 1/2 off pizza. My boyfriend and I each had a few beers and shared the piggy back fries and beer bites. The piggy back fries were a modest portion of fries covered in pulled pork, onions, and BBQ sauce. The portion of pork vs. fries was generous and it's just the right amount of food to not make you feel sick afterwards. The beer bites were a little underwhelming: balls of dough served with a watery marinara and pimento-esque cheese dip. I guess this option is better than a nacho cheese but it wasn't easy for dipping. After having a version of this in California where the cheese was baked into the bread, everything else is only mediocre in comparison.   Overall Aces & Ales is a great option for sampling new beers, watching sports events, gambling, or enjoying a rare outdoor patio. They advertise for all kinds of events from karaoke to trivia and if I lived closer I'd definitely be frequenting this bar on a more regular basis.",

However when we got the check, both of my friends got flights which ended up being individually priced beers depending on value. You guys used to have $12 flights which changed to $16, instead of hearing an apology when we asked about it we were told it had been like that for months.   So both of my friends both paid over $45 for one flight! I have never been to a brewery/bar where a flight was over $20. Especially when one is unaware it, it's taking advantage of a customer. People work hard for their money, and you should definitely explain to people how it works. Being honest will make good business.",

We sat on the patio out back which was large, had a big fireplace with seating in front of it and would be great for large parties. We played cornhole while waiting for our pizza and salad. The bartender said they are working on getting better cornhole boards soon as well as getting the place in regulation so they can have younger than 21 year olds on the grounds (for large parties or eating). We got the Eddie Spaghetti pizza ($19, only available in large size)! It says it is spicy but my 4yo ate it without complaint- I didn't notice any elevated spice level either. I ordered it because it was different but I loved it! I can't recall the name of the salad but it had mushrooms, tomatoes, steak, arugula, and blue cheese ! It paired nicely. Highly recommended, though, I do prefer thinly sliced steak on salads.  Not too smoky considering smoking is allowed. It's darkly light- everyone looks better in low lighting, though, don't they? Fun bartender. The kegs can be seen and they have beers in standing refrigerators that you can pick from too.",

The menu puts a creative spin on typical bar fare, without being pretentious. Try the chicken sandwich. The slaw is insane. The jalapeno poppers are made of real peppers, and are actually spicy.

It is my third time there, so I'm not a regular just yet, so I haven't really conquered the whole menu     House Mac & Cheese - $9.50 ---  i guess im used to like BOXED yellow cheddar cheese from KRAFT, i think they use like a off white, or some other coloring cheese. I added crush red pepper crumbs (for pizza's) to spice it up  Arrogant Beer Battered Onion Rings - $6.50 --- only had it once, but had some grease layer/residue (using the fingers, not a fork).... i think the beer battered rings and BBQ combo sauce just don't work for me and my taste buds  Beer battered fish and chips - $13.00 -- a whole piece of cod (market value) cust in two slices, beer battered and served with chips or fries.   This one, I felt that 2 slices was not enough for $13.00 bucks price tag, I felt jipped   **Overall, when me and friend go we are looking at $45-$60 for just the two of us.. and that is a lil high for me.  I've been to dive bars that look like crap on the outside, sell food and get enough for LESS, and barely break $20 bucks, and be stuff til midnight or the next day.  Once again, the servers are nice,  the food (so far) hit and miss,  and the price is  $$, maybe $$$ in my eyes.   But, to each his own.",

Food often tastes particularly good after driving all day, but the burgers were out-of-this-world. Cooked to medium rare perfection, covered with fresh lettuce and juicy tomatoes and a wonderful bun, they were so big I couldn't finish all of the fries or dill pickle that came with my burger.

I am not a really big beer drinker, but I did appreciate all the dedication A&A puts in to providing its customers with a wide variety of beers. I chose an apple cider beer and it was very good and refreshing. I liked how the bar was separate from the dining area. It made it feel almost like 2 different places. A dark and quiet bar on one side and a bright airy dining room on the other side. There is a back room for parties and a patio for some fresh air. The menu provides a wide variety of choices to chose from, salads, pizza, sandwiches, appetizers, main dishes. Our group loved the pizza, burgers, and wraps. They do offer mixed drinks and wine if beer is not your friend. I am not a huge sports fan but I was kept entertained by the numerous TVs mounted.  The wait staff did seem a bit frazzled and skipped over some of us in the party. Food took a while to come out and drinks were not refilled as often as I think they should have been and orders were mixed up as to who they went to when they came out but we were a party of almost 20 so that could have factored in to their confusion.  I hope to come back to try some more of their menu items and another cider beer.",

There is a huge selection of craft beers, including a Farnhouse saison that the BF was excited to try.  They have the typical pub food like wings, but also nontypical offerings. We had their creamy tomato soup topped with a chiffonade of basil. The soup is made fresh, daily--nice and satisfying. It paired very well with the cheese tray set with a slice of creamy brie, wedge of gorgonzola, coin of pepper-crusted goat cheese, grilled slices of artisan bread AND bacon jam!  They have a grundle of screens up in the bar area for sport fans and since it was Tuesday night, the Geeks who love beer trivia event was going on in the large dining area.  This was a live trivia game, with a lot of players and an announcer calling out the questions. Sounded like so much fun. Think we'll swing by with friends another Tuesday to try it out!",

It seems like every single time I've gone in there they are either short staffed or their servers just never come back to the table.  On my first visit we were sat in this large room...away from everyone.  My brother in law ordered about 5 different beers from their menu...and they were out of ALL of them.  ALLL OF THEM.  Our food was overdone.  On my last visit... I went in to watch the game and eat some pretzels and cheese curds and chicken tenders with my sister.... I ordered a water with no ice because I was hot ... maybe because we and a bunch of other people sat outside locked out for about 15 minutes...even after pounding on the door... it took my sister calling the bar to see if they were open for someone to actually come open the door.  I ordered my water without ice and then when the food got there i ordered an iced tea.  The server brought me iced tea without any ice.  I didn't ask for no ice... so after about 15 minutes she finally returned from where ever she was no doubt hiding in the back ...i asked for ice... she looked at me like i asked her to bring me a brand new meal... complained that i ordered water without ice and that she ASSUMED i wanted the tea without it... no... i just made it easy for her...just asked for a cup of ice and for the side of lemon and sweetener I had already asked for... overall...the food is decent and the Groupon deal makes the price worth it... but I'd rather never go there again that put up with their terrible service.",

    "text": "Move over Yard House, there is a new kid in town... and he actually knows something about beer.  Well, Aces and Ales (a locally owned business) isn't new in town, but this new location is definitely the best beer bar in town.  As a fan of the Nellis location, how does it stack up?  Well, the interior is about 2-3 times as big and is much classier.  The atmosphere has the feel of an upscale San Diego beer bar.  Plenty of new lush seating, lots of TV's at the bar, and even a sweet looking patio and fireplace outside give this place a totally new and refreshing feel for Aces and Ales.    When I first heard about the second location and the 50 taps, I feared that Ryan, the co-owner, wasn't going to be able to live up to the original locations rotating tap selection.  I mean, Aces on Nellis is well known as Greg Koch's favorite beer bar in Vegas (CEO of Stone Brewing) and for good reason.  You will find fine craft beer from all over the world that you won't find in other Vegas bars (including Yard House, Public House, Burger Bar, etc).  As a beer geek, Aces 2 has recreated that great beer selection with double the amount.  With a rotating tap selection, there will always be different beers at Aces.  Today the menu ranged from Epic Brewing's Sour Apple Saison, to Nectar Ales Black Xantus, to Ballist Point Habanero Sculpin IPA.   There are bottles of Parabola, most years of Stone's Verticle Epic Series, and The Bruery's special releases.  Each and every single beer on the 50 tap menu is a craft beer, and many of them are hard to find special releases.  Finally, a bar that beer nerds in Vegas can be proud of.    I had the Juicy Lucy for lunch, and it was pretty awesome.  Just as good as the old location.  The beef was nice and juicy with a perfect amount of stuffed cheese and applewood bacon.  The bar is less than a week old, so they are still working out the kinks in the kitchen and getting the patio installed.  The service was top notch, just like the old Aces, except a lot more staff.  Our waitress Kimberly was very attentive and did a great job.        Overall I am extremely happy that Aces and Ales has opened a larger, classier, craft beer bar on my side of town.  If you are into craft beer, unless you are willing to drive 5 hours west, it doesn't get any better than this.",

    "text": "Don't just stand there like an idiot, if there are no hostess or anyone to greet you when you walk in, just claim a seat at the bar or stake a claim to any table and make yourself at home.  Just don't get too carried away and take off your smelly shoes or walking around in your undies.  Exceptions will however be granted on a case by case basis, but don't even bother unless you can make playing rock, paper, scissor look sexy similar to what the MMA ring girls can do just by breathing.  So you think you are into craft beers?  Then buddy, this might be the place for you to hit up. They have 30+ selections on the craft beer list and is updated frequently.  Just keep in mind that their inventory does not seem to be very deep, therefore your first couple of selections may be unavailable.  I don't drink, but there are occasions when I feel like watch the latest game and getting something to eat at bars like Aces & Ales.  Lucky for me, their burgers and salads are above average in the bar food category.  If you want good service, then sit your ass at the bar.  The tables along the wall and on the other side of the bar are for larger parties, but service level is not so great (which was mentioned in several previous reviews).  So on this particular occasion I ordered myself the Arrogant Bastard Steak Salad.  It was an entree sized salad with nicely cooked steak sliced up served on top of mixed greens.  If you are not in the mode for an above average burger from a bar, consider ordering this.  You will probably send me a message thanking me later.  A friend of mine was being adventurous or maybe just looking to find a decent Chicken and Waffle spot in Las Vegas, so that was what he ordered.  I tried some of it, but we both agreed that it was no bueno.  Mucho disappointed, my friend was, as he was wishing he had gone the route of an entree salad.  Well, that was the tiny voice of experience that I did not ignored this time.  We also split an order of Fried Cheese Curds, with the dipping sauces it was a decent appetizer.  I am sure it will not be hard to finish this as you engross yourself in the games shown on TV or the video poker at the bar while snacking.  Anyway, great spot for craft beer lovers and a hidden gem for above average bar foods.  Review #7 of 2014",

The boneless wings were the best I'd ever had, like picture perfect and plentiful! meant to take a picture but my husband and I dove right in. They have great blue cheese too. You can tell their dressings are homemade. My burger was perfection. I ordered a simple cheeseburger with all the fixings and let me tell you it was perfectly prepared. The meat had the best char on the outside and the inside was so juicy and flavorful. I was so full half way through, but it would have been a crime to let the other half go to waste. We left so happy, and the first thing I said when we got in the car was \"the quality is so good there\".  I'm a chef, a recently pregnant chef and I have a feeling I will be craving Aces & Ales a lot over the next 7 months  can't wait to come back",

    "text": "I live in the neighborhood, I looked the menu up online and decided that the man and I would go to a nice Nevada style tavern.  Walk in and nice high seats that encourage community seating. Super fun! Lots of big TVs. Lots of beer. What isn't to love? Oh, just about everything!  I order the beer bites. Pizza dough balls with three sauces for dipping. Yum-o! That and my drink were about the ONLY decent things about this place.  (And the tomato soup). The drink I had was some martini, whatever the chocolate/caramel/coconut one is, I had it.  My male companion ordered a margarita and the bartender didn't put a salt rim on it...you are bartender right? How do you not know to do that??   Everything on the menu sounds amazing, I will have one of everything! We decided that we were in a bar food burger kind of mood.  ***Note to our waitress, Erin, WRITE THINGS DOWN!!!!  I ordered a simple cheeseburger with Swiss and cheddar, well done.  My super hot date ordered a bacon cheeseburger with Swiss, she had to ask him again to clarify his order. Maybe she should have WRITTEN THINGS DOWN at this point if she couldn't remember.  We get our burgers. They look sooo good, I want to devour it. I take a bite, it's like the best burger I ever had, until my next bite included a half melted bite of AMERICAN cheese. Gross. But you know, no one WROTE MY ORDER down. He cut into his burger which looked so tasty I wouldn't let him eat it until I posted a photo of it to Facebook. And it's covered in BBQ sauce. No, he didn't order the BBQ burger he ordered a bacon cheeseburger. Hmmm. She even asked him didn't he order a BBQ burger? Well, if you had WRITTEN THE ORDER down on a piece of paper you could have seen that no, he did not, he ordered a bacon cheeseburger.    Both burgers had to be redone.  And again, she has to ask us what our burgers were. WRITE IT THE EFF DOWN IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER!! We get our burgers, simple cheeseburgers after an eternity, his is great.  Mine however, must have been grilled where the hottest peppers in all the world were because my lips were on fire to the point where I was crying. My dude asked if they season the meat and she said no, so obviously someone didn't clean the grill. Gee, thanks, for the most unpleasant burger experience ever. Our server did offer to make me something else. And wait a third time for food? No thanks.  I will have better luck at home at this point.   Our burgers were generously taken off the bill, but we were still charged for fries and soup which COME with the burgers. Personally, I think after messing up both burgers once and having a replacement sent back for ungodly spicy-ness that a visit from a manager would have been appreciated or the entire bill save for our alcoholic drinks comped.   Our bill came to $35.00 after our $10.00 cheeseburgers were taken off which would have made our bill $55.00 ish.  We tipped $10.00 for terrible service (we had to remind her about waters we ordered, drinks took forever to be delivered to our table-we could see them sitting on the bar, we had to ask for appetizer plates, the menus which LITERALLY are nearly half the size of the table were never picked up, and the ordering debacle..she did not deserve that tip at all!  It wasn't even busy, she had two tables, one guy and the two of us!) Of course maybe the cooks couldn't read her...oh, wait, she didn't WRITE ANYTHING DOWN, so there was nothing to read.... So who really knows why I got american instead of cheddar cheese. And I doubt she poured pepper spray on my second burger, but the tip I really wanted to leave is...  ERIN. WRITE. DOWN. YOUR. ORDERS.    I wanted to write it on the check so the manager could see it, but I left a cash tip and didn't want to end up on Facebook looking like a cheapskate who doesn't know how to tip on a bill even with things taken off and a snarky comment which I saved for Yelp so everyone can see it.  My advice is IF you visit this place ask your server to write your order down so there is no confusion. Don't go expecting good, prompt service. The food is delicious...the stuff that comes out CORRECT from the kitchen anyway.  If you don't go out often and you want to treat yourself to a nice evening out to just relax and enjoy good food, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO DO THAT!  I can promise I will NOT be back.  On a happy note I had a banana and strawberries at home for dinner, I wrote it down and nothing got messed up, I give myself five stars for great service!",

    "text": "Stopped by Aces and Ales last night for a pub quiz, and had a good experience.   I seem to recall coming out here once before, a few years ago, but that was long before my Yelping days.  We arrived around 5:15, and seated ourselves.   Let me say this:  they have an AMAZING beer selection.  The best I've seen since The Freakin Frog closed.  They have like 6 Delirium beers on daught!  That's amazing!  I was on a tight budget last night, so no beer for me, but I will update the next time I go, because I definitely plan to go again.   My friend and I ordered: The Chicken Tenders with Ranch, and the Fish and Chips:   Both were really tasty!  The chicken was not greasy, and they were big pieces, but I was a little disappointed that a $9 dish didn't even come with fries, and there were only 4 pieces of chicken.  But, on the upside, the quality was really good, so I'm not completely turned off by the price.    The fish was awesome. Huge pieces of cod, lightly battered, and super flakey and delicious.  Really impressed with that.   Service was a little bit slow, which was understandable during the quiz, but we were there 2 hours early, and still had quite the wait for a waitress.  Our server was very nice though, which almost made up for the wait times....the big complaint I have is that the server was super quick on refilling the beers of the rest or our party, but not the water glass I had.  We were there for 4 hours, and I only had 2 glasses of water...the second one sat empty for the last 2 hours.    The only other issue I had, was that we were not told when  we arrived that they had happy hour specials...and since it took almost 40 minutes to order, we missed out on happy hour prices.  That bummed me out...I could have had a drink AND something to eat someone would have mentioned it.    At any rate, the quality of the food was good, and it was a pleasant experience, even with the handful of minor things.    I definitely plan to go back, and soon.  The incredible Delirium selection is calling my name!!",

Then wash it down with one of the fine beers from their constantly rotating tap.   Stephanie was super nice and helpful! Water was always full and she provided beer samples before we committed to anything strangely flavored. Only issue is that service was sporadic and slow. Food also came out at odd times, but it's a Friday night so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.   I got the Pizza Port Pickleweed Point IPA (Alliteration: always awesome). Deliciously crisp but still hearty.  Plenty of space to sit down, good open atmosphere with a jukebox and fantastic music selection. Good for a weekend or weekday solo or with large groups of friends. Lots of TVs too to catch up on your sport of choice. Plus, super clean!",

    "text": "First things first, this review is long overdue. I've been coming to this bar for as long as i could and I've never been upset about any visit. This place is like a home away from home. Especially if you're into hair metal and grunge and everything in between.   Second thing, this is the least cigarette smokey bar in LV i've ever been to... which is why I come here frequently. Even when someone is smoking, their filtration system picks it up quick. The recent reviews contradicting this are pure asinine. If its that big of a deal to you, don't go to a bar.  Third, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FOOTBALL BARS. it's unfortunately a raiders bar (i'm an eagles fan), but i came here for almost every football game this year. I even saved a seat for the superbowl because i had such a good time during the regular season games. They have a special brunch menu and bottomless drinks on Sundays. 10/10 worth it  This bar is by far my favorite for beer and food. All the food is fresh made and to order, and they're quick to correct your order if it's the slightest bit wrong. They have the best rotating beer selection, with 50 rotating draft beers. Matt (who is in charge of the beer program AFAIK) is an awesome guy who knows his stuff when it comes to beer and all that's green and golden. He's also a goofy and fun dude with some awesome stories.  Krystal (i'm like 90% sure its with a K?) is one of the best! She is always easy to bs with, and she has great food and beer recommendations! I always know me and my friends are in fantastic hands when she's on the bar. Chick doesn't have a mean bone in her body. Knows what good Whiskey and Scotch are too! I've also got a list of potentially awful 80's movies to watch thanks to her.  Laura and Sarah are typically on the grave shift so i don't see them as often, but i'm always glad when i do. They're always fun and easy going, and quick to fill my cup. Both really sweet girls!  Kim is great too, I always enjoy annoying her for a couple hours. She's fun and super sarcastic like me, and i seem to do better playing keno when she is working the bar. She got me into the Jameson IPA caskmates and it quickly became my favorite whiskey. She's awesome with regulars in particular, even the headass obnoxious ones.  Nicole works more at the Nellis location, but i have had too many interesting conversations with her to not say something about her. She always has something fun to share and I definitely enjoy chewing her ear off when the bar is slow. She's always quick to point out when there's a good Stone on tap (my favorite) and point me in the right direction with something similar if there isn't. This poor woman even got me to awkwardly pose for pictures in their Aces and Ales shirts.   Mitch is a smart dude, and whenever i have an in depth beer question he's quick to provide me with an in depth response- literally down to the chemical science of the beer. He and Matt both know how all sorts of beer are made and fermented, how barrel aged beers come out in different kinds of barrels, IBUs, etc. Great dudes to have a beer and chat with when they're off the bar!  I almost forgot Helen, who is the biggest sweet heart behind the bar. She's fun to chat with and has my favorite sense of humor. She is quick to recognize regulars and remember their type of drinks, and is always quick on her feet.   I don't normally sit at the tables, but i'm always happy when i do. Jenna, Steph, Summer, Mike, Azure, Fallon, and all the other servers are phenomenal. That is an understatement. They always make sure our glasses are full and we have all the food we need, even when the place is ridiculously packed.  Fact of the matter is i can't praise this place and any of these people enough, they're one of a kind. I sure hope i spelt their names right.  TLDR: cooks are awesome, bartenders are awesome, servers are awesome, food is awesome, beer is awesome. There's no reason to go anywhere else. If you genuinely think you a had a bad experience here, i recommend trying it again. You WILL change your mind.",

I was by myself so I hoped it wouldn't be weird to be in a bar/ casino but I grabbed a table and was greeted promptly and didn't even need to ask for water before he said he'd be right back with it.   Menu selection was huge (literally) between the beers and food I couldn't decide what to get. Jessica, my server was attentive with water (huge plus) and checking in on me.    Apple, bacon grilled cheese and arrogant bastard onion rings were the best I've ever had. Food came fast and it was hot and delicious!   Thanks every for the great work, this is definitely a place I'd recommend and I'll be back myself in the future.",

She was as helpful as could be and had ALL of the restaurant bu herself!  The food took a good while to come out, but once it did, it was good.  I had the buffa-lucy burger and my wife had the \"it's too good burger\".  I took the homemade tortilla chips and salsa as my side.  The burgers were good and my wife's fries were good, but the homemade tortilla chips were not cooked properly.  Needed to be in the fryer longer..   We also had the crispy deviled eggs and they were delicious!  Would recommend it, but if there's only one server, be prepared to wait...",

After leaving my review the manager of operations dmed me and apologized for the service. For someone to take there time to make sure they got back to me and try to make it right changes my review for sure. I will be going back to try some more beers and food soon.",

Upon entering, we seated ourselves right away. Learned my lesson last time, no one will seat you.. You just gotta seat yourselves. We got here at 12am thinking it was happy hour. Unfortunately HH is Mon-Fri 12am. And it was technically 12am Saturday. Which was a bummer! Because all speciality cocktails were $5 during HH.   This place is so cold. Like freezing! So bring a light sweater. Our server (totally spaced on the name) took about 15 minutes to acknowledge us. We told her about the coupon. She said we can't use it. We were pretty shocked. The only reason we decided to give this place another chance was because of the coupon and happy hour. So that's 2 strikes already.   We were already here so we decided to order food. Food took FOREVER to come. Just like last time. The beau ordered steak and eggs. The server didn't even ask him how he liked his steak or eggs cooked! Food was ok, the beau really liked how the steak was cooked. It had a good flavor to it.   Probably will never come back.",

    "text": "On my 1st visit here I ordered the juicy lucifer and ordered it medium. It was cooked well and it wasn't too spicy that I couldn't eat it. I loved it. I love spicy food. My husband asked me where I wanted to it the other night and I asked to go back to have this burger again....  This time around I don't know if it was the sauce or what. Despite putting the jalapeno to the side then trying to eat just the patty with a fork...3 small bites max and I just couldn't. It was 20x spicier than before. I mean I love spicy food so why couldn't I eat it? Furthermore, it was undercooked, pink and the patty couldn't keep together. I know what juicy Lucy's are and despite having cheese in the middle the party shouldn't crumble. The waitress seemed annoyed and looked at me weird when I was complaining about the food. No apologies but more judgement from her reaction. I very, rarely return food. She told me she would have to talk to the manager to replace my food that I picked because I did pick a spicy burger. Instead of saying \"I'm sorry, let me see what we can do to fix this for you\" ..she made me feel embarrassed and it was a turn off so I just decided to not even exchange. I kept the fries because they were delicious.    My husband enjoyed his food. He got a turkey, avo and bacon sandwich. We enjoy the beers and the selection there.  After a short wait the manager came out and talked to us. He was very kind and offered to replace my meal and make things right. At that point I lost my taste buds lol and couldn't eat anymore so I declined. However, I love that he came out and took the time. What a stand up guy. Overall, I think this place is great, love that they rotate beers and it gives you a chance to try different beers from all over. My hometown is San Diego, CA so it's nice to drink beers from that area too. Especially since we lived in CO for 5 years before moving to Vegas. It's nostalgic as our first date was at Pizza Port and it's nice to enjoy drinks from there.   I definitely want to come and try out some karaoke and try more of the food because everything on the menu looks good. And of course check out the new rotation of beers :)   Five stars because the manager made the effort to show he cares for the establishment and his guests.",

Mitch was extremely knowledgeable and listened to our particular tastes in beer and wow! So on point! We went during happy hour so drinks and food were $2 off each. We ordered pulled pork fries, bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers, onion rings, and wings. The food was cooked to perfection and the portion sizes were much larger than we anticipated. We had to take most of it home. The best part about the visit was that we bought a growler,my first exposure to an awesome idea, of a dark stout beer and left with full tummies and BEER! I will definitely return to this location and look for Mitch. He knows A LOT about good beer!",

We usually have around 30 people coming from California for super bowl weekend, and we leave the strip and all its nonsense to come here. Service is always amazing. They have a great list of craft beers, food that surpasses your typical \" bar food\", and tons of tvs.  This has come to be our favorite spot to watch the game. Thank you Kim, Nicole, Heather, and Ari for an amazing time! See you next year!",

Watch out, the chipolte aioli it comes with has a kick! Draft list is heavy on the California brews, but always has some local Las Vegas brews.

The server, Erin, who was clearly very busy, did a great job of making recommendations and providing timely deliveries.  You come here for the beer selection, so I won't go too into detail, but just know that Aces & Ales has the most reasonable prices for the highest quality products. The price points are dead on and there is something for every taste at every level.  Our food, including artichoke and nachos, was both creatively prepared and palatablely (new word) exciting.

So we ordered appetizers, we got the salt and vinegar crisps and the arrogant bastard cheese balls, I'm not sure if that is the exact name. So the cheese balls were pretty good, but the potato crisps were so salty and they bring you a spritzer with the vinegar inside, which was gross cause it just made the chips soggy, yuck. For our meal , I got the Mac and cheese burger and my brother got the juicy lucifer burger. I'll start with the worst, my brothers burger had raw ground beef hanging off the side. I said to him what's the red stuff, thinking it was like some red peppers or something, he thought the same. He didn't even realize he ate raw ground beef and was too embarrassed to tell the waitress. He is like that and it bugs me, so I could not get him to say anything. Ugh, thank God he didn't get sick, he has a stomach of steel. That was just gross! My burger was actually cooked, but the meat was bland as heck and the burger had no sauce, it was served dry with the Mac and cheese on it and a slice of red onion, I kid you not, about an inch thick! Won't be going back, the food is just nasty. I mean who the heck serves raw ground beef, that's a health hazard and dangerous! He could have gotten really sick. Oh and by the way the music was so loud, I thought I was at a classic rock concert!",

    "text": "My initial impressions of Aces and Ales II on Tenaya were less than favorable.  I sat at the bar and was ignored by the bar tender who walked by me twice before standing around talking to another customer who already had his drink.  Then I noticed the sign on the poker machine saying the seat was reserved for players only.  I was not in the poker playing mood.  I have never seen that anywhere else.  I thought that was kind of rude.  All I wanted to do was order a pizza to go and get a beer while I waited.  I ended up sitting in along the wall and eating there.  Service, when service was recieved, was great.  My server was very friendly and helped me to decide on a beer since I was lost in the number of options they have available.  I settled on a seasonal pumpkin porter.  Holy cow was it ever spiced.  It had a kick to it, no doubt about that.  It was good though. When my pizza came out, the Eddie Spaghetti pizza by the way, my server told me I had to finish it all.  Challenge accepted!  This was some wicked pizza.  Thick and fluffy crust with a bit of a chew and a crunch on the edges.  It is a special kind of pizza topped with spaghetti and meat sauce, pepperoni, spicy Italian sausage and mozarella cheese.  I loved it and wanted to keep eating but alas I could go no further.  Challenge failed.  No worries though.  I was able to take it home where I managed another three meals out of it.  Each reheating was just as good though the spaghetti dried out a bit.  Upon settling my tab I was offered a couple of coupons for a free beer.  I will be back soon to try more seasonals.",

The first time I ate here we sat in the dining area and waited at least 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us even though there was no one else there. I ordered the Jalapeno Mac n Cheese and it had absolutely no flavor at all. There was zero heat from the huge slices of jalapeno on the top. They appeared to be thrown on as an after thought. I was not impressed. But we tried again last night.....still not impressed.   This time we sat in the bar but it still took at least 10 minutes to be acknowledged. There were two servers and neither one seemed interested in taking our table. When a server did stop by she asked for our drink and food order together and seemed annoyed. This time I ordered boneless wings figuring it was a simple order. I was the last to get my food and they were cold and tossed in a sour tasting wing sauce. The menu said spicy and they were not.   Lastly the bar allows smoking and it was thick in the air. Unpleasant when eating. They have a patio why not make the smokers sit outside. It's not like it's the Midwest and freezing.",

    "text": "I give A&A an A-OK rating mainly due to their selection of beers.  I most recently enjoyed their flight of six 4oz beers for $16.  My favorite of the flight was the Anderson Valley Wild Turkey Bourbon Barrel Stout.  I  have found the service to be hit or miss on my visits and they need to do something about the bathrooms that reek as you walk in. The only other thing to get around is all the communal seating which is fine for Oktoberfest or any other beer fest but not everyday drinking.  Ultimately, weird bar/restaurant layout and service model but the beer wins in the end.",

I could go on. A little pricey, but consistently good, and they have a discount at happy hour. I have only eaten in the bar, but the service has always been great.",

    "text": "Me and my buddies come here quite frequently because of the awesome beer selection, but tonight's experience has guaranteed that none of us return. Our server (middle aged lady, with dark wavy hair, servicing the outdoor patio) was absolutely horrendous. She was short and pushy the whole evening. When it came time to split the checks, she had lost track of everyone's receipt. Our group was more than cooperative with her. We helped her assign drinks and remained amicable throughout the process. But our severs attitude was really truly awful. She became frustrated when we notified her that her ring-outs were incorrect. After re-ringing multiple times, she began snatching receipts out of our hands and offering rude comments. Unacceptable. Especially considering how accommodating our group was being. After this continued for some time, she picked up a check to declare \"no tip???\" Looking around to see who had not left her a tip. Under NO circumstances should this ever happen. I've worked in a well established restaurant on the strip for the last 4 years. It was astonishing to me that she would ever confront a customer regarding a tip, especially after such lackluster service. Unfortunately due to this experience, no one in my group will ever be returning.",

    "text": "The beer selection is really good and they offer half off growler fills on Sunday which is awesome! However, if you go I would recommend only coming for a beer or a growler fill. The service is terrible. We waited to get menus, waited for over an hour for our food (which the server forgot the appetizer and mixed up another order.) There were 4 of us and the place did not seem that busy. They either need to have more servers or better ones. The food was very good once we got it but would not recommend going if you are in any sort of rush.",

They have 50 taps of stuff FROM San Diego, that we hadn't been able to find in San Diego!   We went on a mellow Sunday for lunch, and I'm used to poor service at places when things are slow. They were amazing! Our bartender was very fun, knowledgeable and honest about what she did and did not like.   All in all, this is my craft beer Vegas holy grail.   I have been looking for a place with good, well priced food and beer for years. Don't pay $16 for a bottle of Green Flash on strip! Save your money for the cab and head out to the Aces & Ales Tenaya location!   We'll be back in August!",

    "text": "I ordered a Groupon from Aces and Ales, this was our first time visiting.  It started out okay, we ordered our food and drinks.  There was only one server at 5 pm, which I blame the management . Our food took an hour to get to us, and it was mediocre at best (if cold nachos and grossly overcooked chicken fingers qualifies as mediocre), and over priced.  If you want to watch a certain game, don't come here to watch your favorite team. We got moved to watch a game on a certain TV, and every 10 minutes the TV would turn off and wouldn't  come back on for another 10 minutes.  I asked a server to change the TV, which she told the bartender, who completely ignored her.   I won't come back here.",
