So we wanted to follow up with some good quality food. That's exactly what this restaurant offers! The Gyro and Fries were especially satisfying. Filled with meat and flavorful toppings, this was obviously the way to go. The fries that go along with it could be a dish that you could have by itself. It had unique herbs and spices to send your taste buds rolling. The pita bread at this place is just unreal, so soft and warm, it just compliments the food so well.   The service was amazing. They treated all of their customers like family. It's definitely one of those places where they remember their frequent customers.   My experience here was absolutely exquusite, can't wait to come back ^^ !!!",

My boyfriend and I were pleased we stumbled upon this Greek Bistro since we acquired a taste for Greek back in Reno. We were quite sad we'd be leaving the family owned place since we ate there often, but were hopeful when we enjoyed the dishes here. This will definitely be our go to when we get a craving. We tried the falafel appetizer, delicious, and the keftedakia kabob, also delicious! The service was also a pleasant experience. Can't wait to go back and try their Gyro.",

By itself the gyro stood out as being the best I have ever had and the tzatziki put it over the top.  The fries where really flavorful as well.    I also tried their lemon soup and that had a great taste to it and i will definitely order it again.  Oh and the baklava is amazing as well!  My parents ordered the gyro salad which we both agree was sensational.  We are originally from Chicago which has a huge Greek community and my mom said it was the best Greek food she has tried outside of Chicago.  it has never let me down and is the only great place I will go to in town for Greek.  The family that owns this restaurant are all extremely nice people and it shows when you walk in the door with their warm welcome and smiling faces.",

I tried the Gyro salad  and I loved it! It comes with a house made, olive oil-based dressing that really makes the salad! I'm not a fan of olives so I got the salad without. The lettuce (romaine) was fresh and crisp. The gyro meat (and there was plenty of it!) was tender and flavorful. Salad also came with feta cheese, red onion, tomato, cucumber and a wonderful tzakai sauce. Salad and soda came out to $13.00. I will return when I'm in the area!",

My wife and I enjoyed the chicken souvlaki which came with a salad first. The salad was very good. Then came the grilled chicken which looked to be marinated in a sauce similar in color and taste to our salad dressing, with onions and grilled tomatoes, and we opted for the rice pilaf. A small plastic tub came on the side with tzatziki sauce, which was maybe the best I've ever had in my life. The owner came over to pick up my plate and I remarked how great the food was and that the True mark of great Greek food for me is the tzatziki sauce. Her response was, \"We have the best tzatziki sauce in the world!\" I'm coming back to try the lamb and I'm getting extra tzatziki!!!",

The Dolmades, the falafel sandwich, and the Mythology beer was so delicious. My husband had the shrimp on top of delicious rice. The pita was fresh and delicious.

We had a $25 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate which stated we had to spend at least $37.50, which is why we ordered so much food. We ordered beer and wine also so we did hit the minimum we had to spend. At first the older female owner (the same in previous reviews) took the coupon and said it didn't apply to the beverages. But I showed her in the description that is doesn't state that, just that we had to spend $37.50. She went to the back and after a few minutes came back and said ok, but didn't seem too thrilled about it. She was still very nice though and seemed to appreciate our business.   The traditional gyro is the best! My wife and I agreed that it was better than the chicken. And the pita bread is delicous. The greek salad was really good and so were the fries. If you're looking for a great gyro this place is a must. We will definitely go back in the future (and order less food).",

Only caution would be if mildly spicy red peppers are not your thing, just let them know to go easy when you order. They are very accommodating. The chicken soup and Greek salad could easily be a whole lunch meal or even dinner for a light eater. Although they don't prepare the pita dough, they do bake it on the premises.

Service started out with a bit of attitude considering the joint was empty -- and we were a little skeptical when he said the gyro was the best in town -- but ya know, I think it was.  I've not tried all of them  yet, but it's not a bad aspiration if I were in serious need of weight gain (which sadly, I'm not) so I'll have to consider it a treat and good to know about in that wasteland of nothingness food-wise...  If you're really in the mood to splurge, they have plenty of Greek dessert options, or you can get frozen custard at Neilson's next door who's stopped making sandwiches, probably because the Greek Bistro's are too good to compete with...    ahhh summer....",

    "text": "Yum! I'm an instant fan. Now I know of two awesome Greek restaurants near my house.  If you are dining in there are tables for sit down service. Take-out is either called in ahead ordered at the register in the back. We were doing take-out yesterday.   Someone greeted us soon after coming in and asked if wanted to dine in or take-out. We grabbed a menu at the back counter, picked out our dishes, and ordered. Food pricing was reasonable and our food was ready to go in less than 10 minutes. It seemed like a friendly family run restaurant.  I ordered the Shrimp a la Greek. The sauce on the shrimp was good and I absolutely loved the bed of rice. The rice had almonds, spinach, fruit, and plenty of seasoning. It was one of the most addictive rices I've ever had. There was a nice amount of salad and the dressing was really good. The dressing was different than other Greek dressings I've had, but in a good way. The pita was really soft and nicely seasoned. I was definitely impressed with each part of this meal.  My husband had the Greek Plate which came with gyro meat, Greek potatoes, pita, and salad. He loved this meal. I sampled the Greek potatoes and thought they were well seasoned and delicious. We also had the Baklava, but that wasn't my favorite. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best I've had.  Greek Bistro is definitely one of my local favorites now. Yummy with great service.",

The food was great. The pita was warm, fresh and soft. The fries were tasty and crunchy. But where's my to-go order?  We had to follow-up many times with 3 different people. \"I didn't think you wanted it now.\" WTH??? No apologies whatsoever. We were very late for our meeting and a co-worker starved to death.

I got my food in a timely manner and the server was very attentive, making sure my glass was never empty.  When I got my food I took my first bite and kicked myself for staying away so long.  The pita was warm and soft, the meat seasoned perfectly and warmed up just right, the edges had just a bit of crisp and the sauce - as always Yum!

A great salad dressing, one that i have never had before.   Gyro: very good tender meat and the tzatziki and fries holy cow so great!   And the baklavaaaa, yes you have to sing it, was out of this world, straight out of the oven! Best honey I have ever had light and crunchy. When he put it on the table it screamed TADA!

I had a glass of wine a gyros on the last visit and it was just 25.00 with a healthy tip. I love small family places and this doesn't disappoint, all fresh all good. I saw someone have the lamb shank and next time that is what we will get.   Cheers!",

I ordered the gyro plate. The pita bread tasted amazing, the meat was so flavorful, the tzatziki was delicious and the lemon potatoes were perfect.  My boyfriend ordered a shrimp and rice plate that was amazing!  The side salad that comes with the meal is really yummy too, lots of feta and great house dressing.  The two owners were there tonight too, such a sweet couple. The lady was our server, her hospitality and friendliness was outstanding.  This is a great restaurant that I will recommend to everyone.

Yes I'm pretty picky and have strict standards with how I rate food quality, taste, ambiance, and most importantly service. I may not be Greek, but I wished I knew someone who was to show me a better spot than this joint. Actually, not really. This place is the spot I bring friends, coworkers, and family to when they want real good home cooked Greek food. Best tasting big & juicy chicken gyros and awesome seasoned fries with yummy tzatziki sauce! From their hummus, to the other dishes I dare try not to misspell...this place is a must dine!

The gryo salad was also spectacular and upon request they kept the meat separate so my salad didn't warm on the ride home.  Good prices, great service and outstanding Greek fare.   Now they need a fancy location with a bar so I can bring my wife on our anniversary.",

I have been going to this restaurant for 12-13 years. I took family, friends and coworkers to this restaurant, I loved it so much. But the new owners just aren't the same. The salad dressing is all oil and gave me diarrhea twice, I ordered a Chicken Gyro Plate and was given Beef Gyro Meat (took and hour total to make and remake the right order), received chicken that was not fully cooked and tasted like propane or some type of fuel. And the waitress seemed to be struggling with orders, heard other people at the restaurant complaining of getting the wrong food and long wait times. Ugh so frustrating, really disappointed.",

I had just came from kick boxing near by and I wanted to eat a healthy salad and my mom suggested this place.   As soon as I walked in the scenery caught my eye.  It was so beautiful. Blue and white and there large pictures of Greece. My Goodness I suddenly felt like there was apart of me that was missing all along. It really made me emotional.   Being part Greek and not knowing the first thing about being Greek started to frustrate me. I didn't know what the sauces were or Falafel  it all looked so good and it was hard to choose. The lady who served us was beautiful and nice. She didn't speak much to us but she was very sweet.   When our food arrived it looked amazing. Everything was fresh and perfect. The olives they put in the salad is so good. That homemade sauce was so BOMB!! I'll try that place at least once a week or once every two weeks.   I was so urged to take pictures.   Weird memory though it kind of smelled like old mop water but it was when I first walked in. It wasn't that bad.",

    "text": "I had a craving for Greek food while in Henderson and stumbled across this mom & pop restaurant near Sunset Station. A small & cozy place that has a mural of a city to make you almost feel like you're in Greece plus the some of that great Greek music that makes you dance in your chair...OPA! Oh they did happen to play the Mamma Mia soundtrack while we were there so I felt like I was reenacting the movie but it was still an enjoyable atmosphere.   The owners were great and friendly, providing quick service and checking to make sure that you were satisfied with your meal. Overall we were pleasantly surprised by this place & highly recommend it to those craving Greek and near Galleria mall!   We started with the baba ganoush appetizer and this little sucker packed some flavor. This was the best baba ganoush I have had in a while, not to mention the crispy & soft pita that came with this dish.   For entrees, we ordered a chicken gyro with fries and a beef kabob with rice. Lots of food for the price, yes I thought it was pricey for being a small restaurant but the food quality did make up for the price. The beef was so tender, it melted in your mouth. Salad had a great homemade olive oil dressing. We were happy campers with our meals and stuffed. I was a little sad that I couldn't sample dessert because this truly wouldn't be a great review without dessert. I did, however, settle for a Mythos, which taste like a Heineken.   This place is definitely worth checking out, if not dining than definitely take out as most people were doing.",

After seeing so many positive reviews and not having any Greek food in quite some time, I gave it a shot.  Fortunately, Yelp guided me is as the restaurant is a little off the Marks Road (and just south Sunset), and the signage is not visible from Marks Road.  The decor is modest but, more importantly,  the staff was very friendly, the menu / selection was decent, and the food / prices were awesome.  During the course of my meals, there was a steady flow of carry out business which is always a good sign.  I plan to visit again - soon!",

    "text": "The restaurant is small with a beautiful picture of a coastal city. There are several beers available, plus greek coffee (similar to espresso) as well as their food menu which includes salads, sandwiches, desserts, etc.   I opted for the falafel wrap and my boyfriend had the gyro platter with the lemon potatoes. We had a baba ganoush appetizer to start, which tasted fresh with a nice eggplant flavor but smelled strongly like peanut oil. It came with soft fluffy pita bread and crispy pita chips. My falafel wrap was alright, with lots of crumbly falafel balls inside of it. It came with a greek salad, which I had wrapped on the side so I could take it for my lunch at work. I enjoyed the salad, especially the fresh dressing that seemed to be made in house, but it was essentially a standard greek salad. My boyfriend was a bit disappointed with his platter, which came with meat strips, the potatoes, salad and sauces. He felt that it was over priced for what it was.   The mythos beer is nice and light, goes well with the flavors in the food.  The service was pleasant and our food came out fairly quickly. The main reason I didn't rate it higher is because the price seemed high compared to similar restaurants in the area and how unremarkable my boyfriend found his meal.",

I stumbled upon this quaint little restaurant today, all by mistake. I called to order take out, but accidentally called the wrong place. Oops!   When I arrived, (a bit past the 15-20 minutes) the food was still hot. I enjoyed seeing the Greek restaurant was actually ran by GREEK people!  My mother had ordered a Chicken Gyro and I had ordered a Chicken Souvlaki plate. Both came with salad and the souvlaki plate came with the choice of rice or potatoes, all for $24. Reasonable price. I opted for the delicious rice.  As soon as I tasted the rice, with some Tzatziki I added, my taste buds had an explosion. It was delicious! The pita bread tasted homemade and  was extremely soft and delicious. The chicken was good, but I have had better. It was really tender, hot, and satisfying. Yet, it seemed like there wasn't enough flavor or maybe too strong of a certain flavor. All together, the chicken, rice, and pita in the Chicken Souvlaki plate were enjoyed! They were actually devoured! The salad was just as amazing with not too much dressing, nor too little dressing. So yummy! My mother said she loved the gyro. I took a bite and agreed to disagree. The  chicken wasn't what I would've expected. I don't know if it had too many condiments or such, but it could have been better. Much better. The chicken in the souvlaki plate tasted somewhat better.   I might be back, I might not. Depends on whether I call the right place next time!",

Love the fact that their gyro meat is moist and tasty which contrasts the dried out bland meat at other Greek wanna-be establishments.  Being family operated certainly makes the difference.  Even the most basic Greek dish (gyro) is served with all the attention it deserves to keep diners happy. The baklava is a heavenly desert - rich and yummy.  Oh, every time someone enters the Greek Bistro they are welcomed with a sincere greeting.  Even if you are not necessarily a Greek food fan you gotta at least try this bistro simply for the quality of the food. Their strip mall store front-like location makes this place a hidden gem as it's off the main road - almost hidden right off of Sunset Station's open air parking lot (East side) and behind Wildfire casino.

Falafel ($5.95): Appetizer version comes with four falafel, lettuce, tomato, pita bread, and tahini sauce. The falafel is DELICIOUS. The flavor and seasonings are so good, it almost makes me not want to eat meat (almost). I loved the tahini too.  Tzatziki ($5.55): A very generous portion of this popular Greek yogurt dip served with warm pita bread and small pita chips. I really enjoyed their version of tzatziki; perfect balance of flavors. Also, I thought it was so neat that you have options with soft, fluffy pita bread or crunchy pita chips. I preferred the bread with tzatziki, whereas the chips were fantastic with tahini.  Traditional Gyro ($8.99): Stuffed with the famous gyro meat, lettuce, tomato, red onion, and of course, tzatziki. Stuffed is a pretty accurate description since this sandwich is HUGE! It's also delicious. It's served with Greek Fries or Salad (I opted for the fries). The fries have a wonderful seasoning on them, but lacked in salt and flavor. Not a difficult problem to fix with a little help from table salt, however, they still rated rather low on my \"Favorite Fries List.\"  My friend ordered the Chicken Gyro and fortunately, I tried their fantastic chicken! It's moist and very flavorful. Even the little one really enjoyed it. I rarely order chicken in Greek restaurants since I love gyro meat so much, but their chicken is convincing.  Service was great, too. The young gentleman assisting us was prompt with his service throughout our meal, accommodating, and very kind. He was so sweet with the baby!",

It's a perfect hidden gem just outside of Sunset Station and I drove past it the first visit.  -the interior is decked out in the blue and white colors of the Greece flag and is very bright and clean, no dim lighting to hide anything here. Greeted by a woman who may be the owner we were given a menu and she answered all of our questions.  -I had my usual Greek favorite, salad with Gyro meat on top. A very large portion of lettuce, tomato, onions feta, olives and topped with Gyro meat and served with dressing and tzatziki sauce. It was very good and definitely filling. I tried one of my wife's falafel balls and these were also excellent  -There are many Greek places in the area and this ranks up there with the best of them. I will be going here frequently!",

This was plan B after Great Greek had closed up shop due to selling out of food!?!?!(that's what we were told) We shared an Avgolemono, Wifey got the Chicken Gyro with Greek Fries, and I decided to go with the owner's suggestion of the Moussaka.  The Avgolemono was okay, but we preferred Great Greek's version better. However, we preferred the Gyro and fries here, even though the portion was a bit smaller, Greek Bistro still gets our vote. The seasoned fries with the yogurt dip are so addicting! The Moussaka came with a side salad and was very delicious and quite filling.  Greek Bistro is a great alternative if Great Greek is closed for the day and you're craving some Greek grindage...ALOHA!!!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(19/100) \"Greek Grindz\"",

I thought Greek food sounded yummy, and I knew this place was close, so we decided to try it.  First of all, it's really cute. I love the decor, with the blue chairs and the mural of Greece on the wall.  We entered the restaurant and were immediately greeted by a nice young guy at the counter. When we said we were eating in, he said we could sit anywhere we'd like, and he brought us menus.  We decided to share hummus to start.  It was really tasty and served with fresh pita bread, as well as pita chips.  I think the chips may have been baked and they were really the highlight - they were SO good!  Then we shared the gyro plate, even though I wasn't sure it would be enough food.  Boy was I wrong! It was more than enough for 2 hungry people and it was so delicious.  The meat was some of the tastiest I have ever had, the tzatziki was fresh and the salad was huge!   The service was pretty much invisible, which is totally OK. I don't need a lot of attention to enjoy my meal.  It's a family owned place, and everyone was very friendly.  We really enjoyed our meal and are looking forward to going back again soon.",

Conveniently located in the same parking lot of our hotel, the Palace station, we were able to walk there and were seated right away. I ordered the lamb gyro which was soooo good-the lamb was moist, soft, flavorful and generously portioned; the tsaziki sauce was yummy; the pita was warm and soft; and the Greek salad was tasty! Not to mention, our server, raphi, was such a kind, personable and lively young man. We were able to have a great conversation about his academic endeavors, travel and food.",

    "text": "I was hesitant to try this place out since it was so close to The Great Greek. The reviews are half what GG has but the stars came out to be about the same. It's a little slower paced here and not as prosperous as GG. Food wise, it is very tasty and cooked well. The service is very friendly. We ordered 3 traditional gyros and a chicken salad. Why 3 gyros? No one wanted to share theirs I guess, me included. The fries is crunchy and seasoned. There was no oily residue. The traditional gyro was made of lamb and beef that they ground into a pate meat. I was afraid it was prepackaged from Uncle Sam...Sam Walton that is (he of beat up pick-up for Wal-mart grand openings while family are each multibillionaire jetsetters fame). But the smarter half said that's how they make it, they put it through a grinder. You can see the kitchen from the counter so I suppose if you had no shame you can stand there and just watch them feed the machine. The dish came with a side of yogurt mayo kind of dressing which was perfect for the fries. I used both ketchup and the yogurt mix. The rest of my table preferred the yogurt only but I put ketchup on my fried chicken and rice sometimes so I slathered it in my fries of course. Relax, it's Heinz not Hunt's catsup. Overall, GG prob a tad better but this is not a bad alternative either. They have different dishes and both make their dishes well. The chicken salad was well made, seasoned grilled chicken, plenty of romaine lettuce (I think) and some tart olives to keep you awake in case you got a case of food coma. Prices are about the same as GG. We went in at about 5:30ish so there were plenty of tables, come 6pm, most of the tables were filled. One chicken salad, 3 gyros, and 2 beers came out to be around $44. I think the salad was about ~$10.95 and the gyros at ~$8.95.  Being a block away from each other maybe they know each other or are related? They had a cute/weird phrase above the counter....\"the heart of Greece lies in its food every bite is like a kiss.\" It might be one of the few times where I got lucky and didn't know about it. If I knew earlier, I would've brought my Chapstick.",

It's very small on the inside, but clean, and beautiful. I ordered my dish to go since I had some perishables in the vehicle I had to get home.  I ordered the chicken soulvaki plate which came with a greek salad, your choice of potatoes (i had the greek potatoes), chicken, and a soft pita. The pita, as other posters have mentioned is really soft and fresh, homemade tasting. The food tasted great, but the portion size for the $13.99 I paid was shocking.  Yes, it was to-go, but still...I'm used to paying about $10.00 for the same back home and the portion size is huge. It came in a styrofoam takeout container with the chicken in the larger area, the greek salad in the smaller area, and greek potatoes in the smallest...there were 3 quarters of potatoes.  The food is good, but I think they overcharge slightly based on what you actually get. Maybe it's larger if you dine in, but I'm not sure. I may or may not go back.",

Also, they had a special on their specials board saying chicken and shrimp gyro my husband ordered that and the waitress says they don't carry that and we tried to show her that it was on the board but she says that they didn't have it and then I heard the cook saying that they didn't have any chicken cooked.

Pleasant ordering process.   Both orders came for me and ONLY me! Don't judge!! Both were indeed excellent in my opinion and this place will be marked as a lunch location when I'm in Henderson.  Yes, I will return!! Thanks for the positive lunch experience!!",

However, the food is so great the owners deserve more people to know about them. I worked at a Greek restaurant with a much larger menu for a significant amount of time and this place blows them out of the water.   The chicken is so moist and flavorful, the salad is absolutely delicious with the perfect about of dressing and ingredients. They're not skimpy at all, the load the gyros with meat. The hummus is delicious also, sometimes hummus can be too grainy which can ruin the flavor, definitely not the case here.  Service is quick and efficient. The inside of the restaurant is alright, you can definitely see what they're trying to get across. The atmosphere I'm not completely in love with, but then again they don't have much space to work with. I'll keep going back because it's delicious, healthy, a great deal, and close to work. Give it a try, you won't regret it.",

Anytime I go to different Greek restaurants, I find myself comparing them to Greek Bistro and I'm always disappointed. No one comes close to Greek Bistro's deliciousness!

    "text": "This is one of the closest restaurants to where I've called home for over 5 years, and I hadn't ever tried it. Today, I told myself \"no more excuses.\"  Yes, I finally went to Greek Bistro. It's exactly what it says on the tin: a small Greek restaurant, hidden in a small strip mall behind Wildfire Casino and on the outer circle of the \"ring\" surrounding Sunset Station. I stopped in after 1:30 for a late lunch, finding a surprising number of tables occupied but with plenty open for myself. The blue-heavy decor is charming in its way, but I would probably not order dine-in here if I wasn't so concerned about eating freshly prepared food.  [Rambling personal story warning!] I wasn't always as ambitious with trying unfamiliar businesses as I am now, and none of my friends ever invited me to try this place back in my first few years around. I finally did invite someone to try it with me around Christmastime 2015, but they had closed early on that evening, so I pushed it to the back of my mind again. Lately, I've found myself more and more frequently bemoaning the lack of great food on my side of Henderson, so I finally had to address one of the biggest potential counterarguments.  The young man who greeted me was quick with asking for my order and surprisingly quicker coming back around after I asked for some time to think about my order. Truth be told, I was stalling to take menu photos, a challenge that became far easier after a woman who is presumably the owner offered me a to-go menu. This version didn't have the reflective plastic cover that their standard menu does, and prices were consistent. And the food was good, even great at times.  I had the traditional gyro sandwich ($8.99) with fries, and the gyro was certainly one of the better ones that I've had to try. Delicious tzatziki and fresh lettuce, tomato, and red onions adorned the beef and lamb slices, which were still the star of the dish. The pita was solid, not exceptional. I was disappointed by the lack of salt in the fries themselves, which can only be covered up so far by the seasoning or by extra salt, and the surprising slight dryness of the fries' interior. The tzatziki was a fun dip for the fries though, and I found myself using the tzatziki to pick up seasoning from the bottom of the tray. That aside, I would order the small salad instead of the fries.  Dessert was better. The baklava ($4.25) is a surprisingly huge square-shaped portion that's roughly 3 inches per side. I would not recommend taking it on alone, and I even ended up asking for a to-go box despite (or because of) how much I enjoyed it. When you break into the baklava, honey oozes out of the crispy fillo dough with a layer of crushed walnuts inside and a garnish of crushed pistachios on top. The flavor is somehow richer and more nuanced than other baklavas that I've had in the past. I was very wrong about this neighborhood not having good desserts, and I'll be sure to try their other sweets now that I know where to look.  I also ordered a moussaka ($13.95) to-go. I hadn't had this dish in ages, but I'd always fondly remembered the eggplant and ground beef layered dish that I'd tried years ago, and this brought me back. Loved the spices in the moussaka as well as the side salad of lettuce, cucumber, red onion, tomato, and feta. There's an additional side of seemingly the same sauce that bathes the moussaka, and I wasn't sure what to do with it except just enjoy it slowly with every bite of the moussaka. The portion is a bit more of a huge lunch or solid dinner, so you might consider sharing it. Moussaka, baklava, and maybe an appetizer? Sounds like a great meal for two right there.  Greek Bistro is an enjoyable restaurant that may indeed be the gem of this mostly chain-ridden side of town. I'll definitely explore their menu further, and I won't wait another 5 years to do so.",

I tried dolmades and mousaka...delicious! Gotta have that hint of cinnamon which is a trademark of Greek cooking. Also the shrimp with spinach rice is excellent too. Highly recommend this little bistro and am looking forward to trying the rest of the menu!",

I've been coming to this restaurant 1-2 every other week , always meeting the same friendly faces every time I show up.  I would give a 6/5 if I can :)",

Inconspicuously located just east of the Sunset Station Casino Hotel, you will be welcomed by very pleasant Greek Orthodox owners who migrated from Persia to Armenia. Their friendly son serves at Lunch Time. At dinner time, meet the husband and wife owners who show their care for providing excellent service in a \"mom and pop\" environment. We both ordered Gyros Sandwiches. Mary ordered the NO SALT Fries while I brazenly ordered the very tasty salted herb chili fries with tzatsizi yogurt/cucumber sauce (which made me happy but later in the evening raised my blood pressure in the evening).  UNDOUBTEDLY this place reminds us of our go to Gyros stop back in Munich, Germany and is by far the best place for Gyros in Henderson. Compared to the other smoky places, we keep coming back here after our shopping at the nearby Costco, TJ Maxx and other fashion stores around.",

I didn't care for it but it was well prepared, hot and served with a smile. Service was great from the lady at the counter. Tzatziki sauce was delicious! Waited a reasonable 10 minutes for my order to-go. I wouldn't mind giving it another try and going back for a gyro.",

It took a little while for this to get plated up but so worth the wait! Very unique dish.  Also to start with we got the pastry with the spinach and feta. The pastry was light and flaky however the pastry stuffing was kinda sparse on the feta cheese.   The pita bread and salad was pretty standard and the service was good.  I nabed a square of bakalava on the way out and ended up eating it for breakfast the next day! Super flaky and ow so sweet. Perfect with my coffee.",

    "text": "I came in to Greek Bistro a couple of years ago just to check out the menu but I had not ordered anything until today. I had been wanting mousaka but did not recall seeing on the menu. It may not have been offered before but it is offered now so that is what I ordered for lunch today. I took it to go.  My mousaka meal came with a side salad and pita bread. The salad was cool and crisp. The dressing was a nice vineagrette. The one olive was a good briney addition. The pita, on the other hand, was not good. I ate one of the four triangles and spit out the first bite of the next piece. I did not finish it. There was an off taste to it. Bitter like old oil. Unfortunate. At least the mousaka was alright. I'd have been really pissed had it been terrible.  But the mousaka was not terrible. It was most definitely different than I was expecting. I know mousaka to be a dish of layered sliced potato, eggplant and beef (like a lasagna) topped with a creamy Bechamel sauce. This was almost like a shepherds pie. There was mashed potatoes on top followed by ground beef and a layer of eggplant on the bottom. There was some kind of red sauce in the mix. While the basics were there, this was wholly different than what I have had before. It wasn't bad but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for either.   Service was alright. Friendly enough. My meal was up in about 10 minutes as I was told it would be. The interior is simple but nice. Clean as well. And the food cooking in the back smelled incredible. But in the end, I wish I had enjoyed this experience more than I did. And thus concludes my final review of 2018.",

    "text": "After driving past here literally 500 times over the past several years, I finally stopped by. Usually I go to another Greek restaurant a little South of here..  Gotta say, one of the Top 2 or 3 grilled chicken kabob/sandwich/pitas I've ever had. A LOT of meat. Most places when you're half way through the pita sandwich, you realize they shoved all the meat at the open end, to look \"full,\" only to leave you with veggies and sauce in the last half. Not this place. Very full and tasty!  The side salad was a good size and tasted like a typical Greek salad. I hate olives, but if I liked em, I might've been bothered by only getting one in my salad. \"Fresh\" is an overrated word when it comes to describing food, but this place deserves it.  I don't see why others say this isn't as authentic a atmosphere as other Greek restaurants. I don't give a crap who works here, as long as the food is great.. but I know several people that won't eat at certain places unless the people making it are of the same ethnicity as the food. For example, my mom won't eat Mexican food unless it's Mexicans making the food. Sushi Twister north of here even uses this to it's advantage with their slogan: \"Japanese owned and operated.\" My point is everyone from the Mexican lady that made my food to the Asian lady that took my order would not defer me from a \"authentic Greek experience.\" Haha, get over it, and just enjoy the food.  My review will turn into a 5 star with a couple more near perfect visits. Great job, and great food so far!",

We also indulged in their salads and let me say simple goes a long way. Their Greek salads left us full and satisfied. We all had different variations of it and the fact that they keep the dressing separate as a standard keeps me and my belly happy. We like to make those important life choices ourselves.

I got the gyro sandwich with fries, and Earl got the chicken salad with a side of falafel (appetizer).  The falafel appetizer came with babaganoush and slices of pita.    I really enjoyed my food.  I ate half of it and was super full already.  Earl ate the rest of the gyro.  My sandwich was stuffed with delicious tender, flavorful slices of gryo.  I also liked the greek fries with the yogurt dip.  Yummy!  Earl's salad was a salad.    Overall, we are fans of Greek Bistro and will always be on our to go to for Greek food.",

I had never heard of this place.  When I got home, I wasn't impressed with their dolmades but I was blown away by their spanakopita.  It was the most unique kind I have ever had, not only with cheese and spinach, but delicious herbs and tomatoes.  Their salad was incredibly fresh and the dressing was delicious.  I'm definitely heading back.",

She was very nice and helpful with the items on the menu. There were four of us. For appetizers we had Hummus and Babaganoush. Which came with warm Pita bread and Pita chips. For our main course we had lamb Souvlaki, Spanakopita, Mousakka and, Shrimp ala Greek. Each came with a Greek salad. The appetizers were delicious. I had never tried Babaganoush before but my sister in law suggested it. The wine she suggested paired well with our meal. Everyone was very happy with their meals. We got some Baklava for later. The meal was very reasonably priced and the service was very good. We have had Baklava before and this was different it had a slight lemony flavor to it which I really liked.",

    "text": "Ok folks let's talk Greek food. I Love greek food and I have been eyeing this place for a long time but haven't gone because the outside doesn't look like much. Thank God I took a chance to go into this establishment! It's like relaxed 5 star dining. The inside is WAAAAAAAAY different than the outside. It is small and beautifully done. I ABSOLUTELY love the decor. I almost wish there were no TVs in it as I feel it takes away from such a beautiful \"Bistro\". Plus if there was outdoor seating it would be AMAZING! You can see the kitchen from the dining room and can just tell how professional this Restaurant is. It was busy with prep. Everyone was dressed the same and still put out AMAZING FOOD! I came here for my birthday and ordered the Dolmades for an appetizer and the lamb shank for my main dish.  My server was this beautiful young lady who has a GREAT presence about her. The dolmades came out and there was bread a tzatziki sauce. Now I Love Dolmades and usually they taste a lot alike. This place has an extra seasoning on them that I can't quite make out...   who the hell cares they were DA BOMB! I gobbled those things up lickety split and the bread with that sauce..  I could have died right there but then I wouldn't have had the chance to taste the lamb shank. The Lamb shank comes out and is huge (I thought I was fred flintstone for a moment). It's served with rice and more bread..  SCORE!!!! It's been 2 days and I can't get that lamb shank out of my mind....I would marry that lamb shank. It is served with a tomato sauce and is out of this world. The meat was so tender and flavorful....I swear I was in Greece at a Michelin star bistro.  I want to go everyday and eat that. It would be my last meal. The rice was cooked to perfection as it was seasoned well and you could taste every grain. The bread of course was phenomenal as usual. Plus the price is WAAAAAAY ON POINT! You get to have a 100$ Plate of food with appetizers and a drink for under 30$......ARE YOU SERIOUS? Yes I Am! You KICK ASS GREEK BISTRO!! My hat is off to the Chef and all the staff and owner. You get my highest honor 17 Platinum stars and a BAZINGA!!!! WOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO!",

The photos of the dishes looked really appetizing!  I ordered the Gyro Salad, spanakopita plate (though I'd prefer it as an appetizer size) and my husband ordered the Filet steak plate.  The best part of the meal was indeed the Spanakopita-- better than the Great Greek's. Unfortunately, that's where the comparison ends.   My Gyro meat looked and tasted like day-old dehydrated meat. No flavor and looked like leather. Does this place serve the crappy dried out pieces for delivery because we're not dining in and can't send it back?  I got about 3 small curds of Feta in the Salad. So I basically paid for a very expensive lettuce and cucumber salad.  My husband's steak was ordered medium rare and  delivered well done. He liked the presentation though. For $50, I expected this meal to be on par or better than The Great Greek.   Needless to say, unless I'm in the mood for $12 worth of spanakopita, we'll NEVER order from this place again.",

This place is slightly out of my way & I feel like it doesn't look like much from the outside so I am really glad someone told me about it.  Based on my experience, I have no clue why there isn't a line out of the door, but I'm glad there wasn't. It was SO good!!!  I am fairly new to loving Greek food, but I definitely have my go to favourites & this place has all of them. I had a hard time deciding what to get, but ultimately went with Spanokopita ($10) & Dolmades ($6) with a glass of Pinot Noir ($6). They were amazing!!! The dolmades came with tzatziki & pita bread. The pita was warm & soft & fabulous. I'm not sure the spanokopita was super traditional. It might be, but it was different from other places I've had it...the flaky dough was almost the consistency of a croissant. Buttery. Flaky. Delicious.  My husband had the Gyro ($10) and said it was the 2nd best one he has ever had. Soft warm pita with a generous helping of lamb and veggies.  The Desserts are all $5. I only had the Baklava, but I definitely need to try the others, especially the Namoorah!!  I will, without question, be back to try the Falafel & Hummus!!  If you are a fan of Greek food, please give this place a try. The service is good. The food is awesome. And, the price is right!!",

But there have been times where they run out...and I can't tell you how disappointing this can be. We also order the Gyro with Greek Fries, spanakopita and the Moussaka also very delicious.

Super fresh, great tzatziki, great flat bread & lots of moist & juicy lamb. Can you say nomnom?!? I can't because my mouth is full of gyro, yo!!!    A little on the pricey side at $10.81 for gyro, fries & drink, but def worth it. The gyro is huge & lots of Greek fries (BTW, the fries are awesome too).  Definitely coming back to this place.

We had to call in before get there to make sure they still have their lamb shank because sometimes they get huge orders and they run out of those very quickly. Their gyros are very juicy and their fries are unique because they put sesame seeds in their seasoned fries. Also, if you have never tried a Greek beer this is a good place to do so.",

I had a bite of his chicken and it was perfectly marinated and seasoned - ditto with the steak.  Their meat marinade must be a well-kept secret, it is SO good!  Our third diner had the gyros plate, which was equally good.  The salad accompaniment is fresh and perfect to go with the food. The lemon potatoes are a must-have and are fabulous.  All in all, I can find no fault with this lovely little piece of Greece in the middle of a small strip mall.  Incidentally, they are very friendly to their patrons in wheelchairs, of which two arrived while we were there. Hospitality and excellent food abound. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I've only been to Greek Bistro for lunch (several times) and have had their salads (good), spanakopita (okay), and gyros (good). The service is good and friendly.   The place is small, in a strip mall, and is not the typical restaurant atmosphere that you would expect when you are having someone wait on you for dinner. With that said, the prices are a little high for lunch and to have to tip on top of that...not for just a good salad. They should go back to more of the casual service environment they used to be where you order at the counter, get your number, and they deliver to your table.   I like them, but I've had better Greek food in Vegas for their prices.",

    "text": "I absolutely love Greek food and this is by far the best I've had in town. Gyro is amazing, both the chicken and the beef! But the absolute winner is their Pasticcio. I have to say it is one of the only dishes in town that I will drive thirty minutes for (about how long it takes for me to get from my apt to the restaurant). The noodles are long and thin, it is well seasoned and there is just enough sauce and ground beef inside; and the top is browned, ahhh I'm salivating just thinking about it. Pasticcio is sometimes called a Greek Lasagna, but I have never had Lasagna this good!! My dad lives around the corner and he was the first person to introduce me to Greek Bistro. My dad is a fantastic chef so my idea of good food has always been a little higher. Before coming to Greek Bistro I had Pasticcio at the Greek Festival held in town every year and was soooo disappointed because I always loved my dad's Pasticcio growing up. But if his was ten times better than their's, Greek Bistro's is ten times better than his. Sorry Dad!! Thank you Greek Bistro for loving my taste buds!",

The meat is juicy and well-marinated. Don't leave without a slice of their galactobureko, which is filo with sweet custard. Usually by the time we leave, we're too full to eat dessert so we take some home for later. It's to die for. The service is also excellent. We've only gone in a handful of times, but the server always remembers us and is very friendly. Don't pass up a chance to try this place.",

The last two times we arrived at 7:30 and 8:30, and the owners were rude to us. They kept staring at us while we ate. We felt uncomfortable as they served us or took our requests as they seemed to be in a hurry to close up shop and leave. We left around 8:30 and 9:07 (they close at 9). They also charged us for yogurt sauce they failed to put on the gyro. It is disappointing to go to one of our favorite spots and be treated this way. I will no longer go here and frequent Crazy Pita instead.",

The traditional Gyro I had today was excellent. It was so big I couldn't eat the salad that was with it. The hummus was good and I had to share it because it too was a large portion. It came with pita chips and bread which was a treat. Overall, the food was wonderful and I'll make it a point to come back. Thanks for a great lunch! =)",

The meat was extremely tender and delicious (cut from the spit). The pita bread was also soft, doughy and delicious.  The tzatziki sauce on the gyros sandwich was creamy and amazing. I thought the sandwich could have used a few more onions but my wife thought it was perfect. The Greek side salad was awesome (not just an afterthought) and the fries were delicious. The staff was extremely nice. For dessert we ate the Baklava, it was warm flaky, cinnamony and sweet and was possibly the best Baklava I have ever eaten.  The Greek Bistro had a very authentic Greek family feel to it's ambiance and was really a joy to have a meal at. This is our new spot for authentic Greek food.  Highly recommend.",

We had the gyro and fries, soup and the falafel platter.  Everything was delicious and well seasoned.  All items were fresh, (as the owner explained, nothing is frozen), and all items are individually prepared from her personal recipes.  Couldn't be much better, especially with a menu that contained other Greek and Mediterranean specialties such as leg of lamb.  While the servings were ample, the desserts, rice pudding and cheesecake are something to save room for.  The server was a very nice older lady, just like mom.  In fact, the entire experience was like being invited to the owner's house while she prepared delicacies from her kitchen.  Definitely worth a try...I will be back.",

I ordered the soup and chicken gyro that came with salad or fries. I opt for the salad. The soup was amazing, the gyro although tasty I wasn't a fan of the tzadziki, I felt the chicken was a little on chewy side. The older woman who works here seemed to be more occupied with other patrons and showing them pictures on her phone which left me sitting waiting for my check with an empty glass of water for a good 15-20 mins. For me personally I will stick to my fav spot. This is not a bad alternative and a bit more $.",

I've been back for lunch multiple times since the first time I reviewed this place, usually for the chicken gyro and fries.  Today I finally switched it up, trying the avgolemono (egg-lemon) soup after some Yelp friends were talking it up yesterday.  Definitely lemony, this chicken soup with rice was a delightful accompaniment to the chicken salad, another first for me there.  Both are served with soft pieces of pita bread and it made for a delicious meal.  I took half of the salad to go since it's a generous portion and I was already a bit full with the soup.  This family-run business always has great service and I'm never disappointed with a meal there.",

I'm not a super huge fan of Greek food but this was really tasty! I would recommend it to anyone looking for Greek food in the area. We had a little bit of everything...Salad, Gyro meat, Chicken, Pita Bread, Lemon Potatoes, Seasoned French Fries, Falafel, and Rice and all the sauces. The meat and chicken was moist and flavorful. Somehow they are able to keep their fries from getting soggy during transport! The Falafel was a bit dry and may have been a bit over cooked, a little dark on the outside. Everyone loved just about every thing, it was a big hit with us! I will give them another try on my own and hopefully get to use them through work again.",

Their pita bread that comes with the meal is also phenomenal. It's the perfect softness and the bread just melts in your mouth. They have it so perfect here.

The gyros are on super soft pita bread with plenty of taziki  sauce and even an extra side for those of us who love taziki. The meat is delicious, very tender and topped with diced tomato and cucumber. They also have a gyro salad it you are watching your carbs :). It comes with either a greek salad or fries. The fries are seasoned and make a perfect match.   Don't leave without trying the baklava. It is so flaky and full of nuts and honey, absolutely delicious.",

The server was nice and friendly and got my ice tea filled every time it was empty. Now down to the food   Chicken gyro 4/5 the portion was spot on and nice grilled chicken  Greek salad 3/5 it was bland I want more sour and tangy flavor  Grilled Beef plate 4/5 the rice was not bad and the grilled beef was right on  Ice tea 4/5 nice taste and I got my refilled every time  Fries 4/5 nice and crispy and hugh portions   I don't know how is this place surviving because they're zillions of good eateries around that area and when I went around 2PM there were only 2 people and myself.",

They have three salads, several wraps and plates, and a variety of desserts and apps. Despite the casual setting, there is table-service. Love the wall-sized photo of Greece and the blue-and-white decor scheme.  The gyros salad is my favorite purchase, topped with tomatoes, feta, and a ton (perhaps a bit too much, best asked for on the side) of delicious tzatziki sauce, as well as a generous amount of gyros meat. Their gyro wraps are also delightful, with fresh and pillowy pita and a giant portion size. Their fries are spectacular, whether or not you order them Greek style and add feta.   Pricing is fair for the portions (about $10/person) and quality, service is friendly, and basically everything on their menu is to die for.",

When it was time to pay, I was unable to due to their faulty machinery. The girl at the front asked me to give her multiple cards, none of which worked (I didn't have cash on me).  After I had been standing there for 20 minutes waiting for this girl to try and figure out the machine, the owner walked over, wondering what was taking so long. They tried again and were unable to fix it.   Then, the owner had the nerve to ask me if I wanted to drive across the street to go to the ATM. ABSOLUTELY NOT! I obviously have other things to do since I ordered my food to-go. And after making me wait 25 minutes due to your screw up, comping me an $8 gyro doesn't seem like that great of a loss (especially since it was probably gonna get thrown out anyway).   Never coming back. They don't deserve my business.",

Sorry for not taking a picture. The food looked and tasted so delish I just started eating. ;)  Honestly I wish more restaurants served crispy non greasy fried food. I have no idea how they made everything on my plate taste so good, just happy they did.  If you haven't been here yet you need to go, it's worth the trip.",

I told him I wanted to place a order to-go and he handed me a menu and said I could sit down and take my time going over the menu. After placing my order, I was told it would be 10-15 minutes because it was being made fresh. I didn't have to pay until my order was ready and the man helping me was very courteous, welcoming and inside was clean.   Chicken Salad ($10.75) - Chicken, lettuce, cucumber, tomato, onion, olives, feta cheese and dressing. The salad was a good portion and the lettuce was very fresh and crisp. I was impressed with the amount of chicken and it tasted so good! I could just eat that chicken alone it had such great flavor. There was 3 pieces of tomato and 2 cucumber slices which was a bummer, I'd have liked more veggies. The menu said the pita bread would be warm, but the pieces were cold. I'm a huge fan of the salad over at The Great Greek (just down the street at Marks and Warm Springs) because of the amount of veggies they put in it and they also include grilled pita bread which I prefer to the cold. While I really liked the version here at Greek Bistro and was full and satisfied, I feel TGG has them beat in that department. I did ask for a side of tzatziki sauce and it wasted very good!   Baklava ($4.25) - Delicious! The piece was huge, sweet and the perfect dessert! When I first saw it, I thought it might be too sweet. It wasn't too sweet at all and the top part was lightly crisp and the bottom was gooey good. Try this!  Since I liked the chicken and tzatziki sauce so much I can see my regular being a chicken gyro here and will give it a try on my next visit. They make your order fresh, so calling ahead can cut down your wait time some. Catering is also available.",

The waitress/cashier was not too personable (adjusting the chairs we had just stood up from and pushed in, etc).  We got two traditional gyros to go. $8.99 for each combo (gyro and fries), slightly on the high side, but definitely not outrageous. The gyros were big and so good! The meat was perfectly cooked, the tzatziki was good and the veggies weren't mush. The portion of fries was huge and covered in Greek seasoning. Not the greatest, but in line with fries I've had at other gyro places.  Craving - satiated!",

I grew up in a city that has a lot of excellent Greek restaurants (Boston, Mass.)  so I know good from great .This one is great. I am a vegetarian, so I had the falafel wrap with its generous salad and the baba ganoush. WOW! Taste sensation! I intend to try the egg lemon soup next time and if I remember from the past the Spanakopita is outstanding. Can't wait. (Just have to stagger my visits. I want to go back every day, lol.)",

The service is always fast and courteous. Parking kind of sucks if you want to be right in front but there's tons in the adjacent Sunset Station lot. I really like this place. It's worth a visit.

    "text": "As of today, this is still the best Greek / Mediterranean food I have tasted in Clark County, although I admit I haven't been to too many such establishments. It's a tiny, quaint little place with some fitting ethnic decorations on the walls and Greek colors over the tables.  The first thing you'll notice about this joint is that it is very much a mom and pop establishment. The food is VERY home cooked and you'll taste it right away. The owner is a Greek lady who is generally a very nice host--but she may fuss a bit over Groupons-- just a warning. You'll also be pleased to find that the servings are quite generous. The wraps are all very filling and come with a heap of delicious seasoned fries. I barely finished the platter when I ordered it for dinner recently.  The greek salad is mouthwateringly delicious and she sure doesn't skimp on it.   As for the gyros, arguably the staple of any place with \"Greek\" in the title, they are the best I have ever tasted. Seriously. You'll immediately notice a difference in the meat that she uses, as well as the authentic Tzatziki sauce that she puts in them. If you order gyros around town at casual fast food places, you'll very easily notice the superior quality of this one. I've also had the Kefka (kabob) and the chicken wraps which were both quite pleasing.   You usually spend about 12-14 dollars per person here, and I hope that doesn't discourage some of you cheaper yelpers out there. Sure, you could probably go get another gyro for half the price within a few miles but the extra few dollars are well worth it for by the superior quality of the food. There is a little bit of a wait, but take satisfaction knowing that it's time spent cooking and preparing your meal freshly.",

    "text": "Definitely will be going here if I'm craving Greek food. Most Greek restaurants by me have food that is either salty or not very fresh. So either the meat wasn't really good so they over season, and they order too much vegetables. Luckily this wasn't the case at Greek Bistro.    I ordered a Gyro plate and my husband ordered a Gyro sandwich. So tasty! Impressed with the salad, and the rice was cooked to perfection. We both left waddling out of there.     Finding this place is a little hard and when you do, you end up driving around a bit to find parking. Don't worry it's worth finding. Can't wait to try the rest of their menu in the future.",

    "text": "I'm originally from Chicago which happens to be the center of Greek food in the U.S.   There are many small fast food places around Chicago where you can get good Gyros sandwiches. I had them once or twice a week- so long story short- I know gyros.  Having a craving for gyros in Vegas is hard. You just can't find it GOOD out here. So after reading the reviews I decided to give Greek Bistro a try.  I ordered the gyros sandwich and Greek fries combo. At $8.99 without a drink it is quite pricey, but I also realize that all the gyros is shipped in from Chicago- nobody makes it in the west, so cost will obviously be more.  The sandwich was not exactly what you would get back east. First was the sauce. Now you are supposed to get \"Tzadziki\" sauce which is a thick yogurt based cucumber sauce that is very light and tasty. I don't know what my gyros was drowning in, but my best guess is some sort of modified ranch dressing. It was a thin runny sour flavored ranch dressing. I took the sandwich out of the tray and the stuff ran out all over.  The gyros meat itself was OK but not nearly as much on the sandwich as you would hope for $9. Also on the sandwich was a few leaves of romaine lettuce ad literally 3-4 strands of onion. Chicago style is loaded with onions.  Also, the gyros slices were very uniform. This tells me they don't carve it from their own spit and probably buy it pre sliced. The texture and taste of gyros right off the spit is far superior.  My only other gripe was I originally wanted to eat in, but after seeing the flimsy looking blue plastic chairs in the dining area (I'm a big guy) I decided to be safe and just take the stuff home.  OK, I have to give them at least one good note. I really liked the \"Greek fries\" Good tasting fries tossed in a spice mixture.  Sorry, but I probably won't be going there again.",

I love the service, the decor, the ambiance and the food in this little slice of Greece! From the first moment of walking in, you can tell this is a small, family owned GREEK restaurant. The decor is tastefully done in all blue and white (Greek flag colors), the blue is especially nice and calming.  You can also see pictures of the owner's family and Greece all around. You can take to go or dine in, your choice. Either way, the service is thoughtful, quick and efficient. My co-worker was there fore the first time and never had Greek food before. The servers all spoke English and explained pretty much every single dish very effectively. Very impressive for an ethnic restaurant especially.  I like their vegetarian menu. Veggie Alexander and salads are excellent. I have yet to hear someone complain about their gyros. Nothing is microwaved here, but cooked right in front of your eyes. The ingredients look and taste very fresh.   This is one little Greek place, unassuming and unboastfull, but serves good, quality food in little time.  One little quip, they discontinued their veggie gyro, which was excellent and my favorite thing on the menu...oh well..this place is still great and highly recommended by me.",

Never having tried it before, it was crispy on the outside like a hush puppy and warm flavorful on the inside. Thought it was pretty good. It was served with slices of tomato. We both ordered gyro's. My better 9/10's had the chicken and I had the original. They both came with a huge amount of herb covered fries. Almost too much! The fries were really good and hot. We each enjoyed the gyro's. It had great flavor and was packed full with meat and vegetables. The greek sauce is wonderful. Great flavors all around! When we were almost done we talked with the \"mom\" of this place and she was delightful. She gladly answered our questions and inquired about our meal. Very pleasant.

    "text": "So the first good Greek food experience I had in Vegas was actually at The Fat Greek off of Decatur. This place BEATS that hands down!!!   It's a small hole in the wall, mom & pop type of place. It has really basic decor (yet a flat screen TV), but plenty of seating and exceptional food. I mean, wouldn't you rather go to a place that isn't visually extraordinary, but has amazing food?  The service was great. They were very nice and accommodating. There were only two servers, one of which I believe was the owner (the 'mom' part of mom & pop), but kept up with the demand of 6 or 7 tables of people.  My mom and I ordered an appetizer of lebneh, which I am SO happy they had, and dolmas (stuffed grape leaves). The lebneh is a kind of strained yogurt, just slightly thinner in consistency than cream cheese and is reminiscent of sour cream. It came out with warm, fresh pita, which is some of the best I've had. It was nice and soft with a wonderful flavor you would expect from fresh bread.  For the main course we both ordered gyros. I mean, you have to order gyros your first time at any Greek place right? She ordered the traditional lamb/beef gyro with a side Greek salad and I ordered a chicken gyro, since I don't eat red meat, with fries. My mom's not very good at description, but told me that her gyro was one of the best she's had...and that's saying a lot seeing as she's been around for awhile - haha. The salad was a basic Greek, but had tons of flavor and the Greek dressing was tasty.  The chicken gyro was DELICIOUS! The chicken was sliced very thin, like you would expect from a traditional gyro, which I appreciated. (When I've ordered a chicken gyro elsewhere they tend to serve it kebob style, which doesn't make for easy eating.) It was very tender and juicy with good seasoning. It was served on that warm, fresh pita with lettuce, tomato, thinly sliced red onion, and gyro sauce. The only bad thing I can say is that they put  A LOT of onion on the gyro...so watch out who you engage in close face to face conversation with later in the day. Mine was served with a side of french fries with a Greek seasoning sprinkled on top...they were SO good. They were nice and hot with the crunchy outside and very soft middle. I couldn't stop eating them, despite my fullness. My mouth kept telling me \"one more\" while my stomach was telling me \"please make it stop.\" Yet, I couldn't stop...especially when those hot tasty fries were dipped in tzatziki. Speaking of, their tzatziki was really good too. It had good flavor and was a nice consistency. It's hard to make a tzatziki that isn't bland and watery, but they accomplished it well.  The pricing is fair too, especially for the amount of food you get. I think we spent a grand total of 30 something dollars for two appetizers and two entrees.  The only thing I really wish they had was an appetizer sampler. They had so many good appetizers (hummus, labneh, dolmas, etc) and I wanted to try them all...but alas...I couldn't. A sampler would be perfect for anybody wanting to try a little bit of everything, but still have enough room to order an entree!! (hint, hint)  I absolutely love this place, and despite the fact that it's hella far from my house, I will definitely frequent here again...and again.",

I was also disappointed that they refuse to honor their entertainment coupon published in entertainment 2009.  No explanation, just that they apparently decided not to honor it.  Despite the food being good, these issues mean we won't be back.",
