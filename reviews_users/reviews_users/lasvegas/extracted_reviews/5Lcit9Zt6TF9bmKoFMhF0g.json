It wasn't oily, burnt, and hard like the other ones I've tried in the San Gabriel Valley.  I had the spicy minced meat dry noodles and they were good and filling for under $10.  Service was quick, which was nice since Las Vegas was a stopping point for us before heading to Zion National Park.",

Taiwanese style soup great for cold days and nights. Personal favorite is their Wonton Noodle Soup and Beef Roll. Another option if your in the mood to have Asian style soup oppose to Vietnamese Pho. However this place can get very busy with tourist and locals because of its popularity but the turnover is pretty quick.",

This place is located next to Chinatown Mall behind a statue and where there's a \"2-Hour Parking\" limit painted on each parking spot.  The people here barely speak English and the few diners the day we went were Chinese and Taiwanese slurping thei soup away - signs of authenticity? Perhaps. Our food came out quick and piping hot. My beef noodle soup wasn't very meaty and I got some with lots of fat. There's fresh bok choi...yum. Noodles were cooked perfectly.  The food was good but sadly, it wasn't even close to satisfying my DTF beef noodle soup craving. I'm still on the hunt for DTF-esque noodles.",

And I'm not talking about a Peking Duck that takes half a day to make; I'm talking about a fried egg, on the menu as a side.  Umm... ok what about the soy sauce egg?  It's on the menu too.  Nope, sold out of them.  20min later I go back into the restaurant to use the restroom and right there sitting in front of two other customers, are 2 big and tasty soy sauce eggs.  Wtf?!  Anyway, plenty of places to eat in  eggs Chinatown.  You're not missing anything if you don't eat here.  Oh, we also got beef rolls, and they were very average.",

Its a small location, family-owned and already having a religious following of yelpers who eat there, this place gets packed easily.   Forget the other noodles soups on the menu, go straight to the best-seller, Taiwanese Beef Noodle soup. You wont regret it. So lets talk broth first, hearty, full of flavor with a medium body. Spice it up with their house-made chilli sauce. Superb. The noodles are cooked perfectly for me, a little soft and not too chewy. Served with huge helpings of vegetables and soft beef chunks. I approve sides orders of beef roll and wonton dumplings in chilli oil. If you're carb-loading the beef rolls are calling your name! Made like a burrito and cut into pieces. Filled with beef shanks marinated in hoisin sauce stuffed with fresh vegetables. Don't think I need to go into great detail of their wonton dumplings. Other than its swimming in a pool of chilli oil heaven. A must try.",

I never have something like that before. The reason I'm giving a three stars is because of the pork chop rice. It was very disappointing!  The pork chop was small and very very dry. They used broken rice which didn't go well with the dish. The whole combination of rice, pork chop and side dishes did not taste good together. I would like to come back and try more of their noodle or dumpling dishes and stay away of the rice dishes.",

Found in a little nook in Chinatown Plaza, next to the Chinatown Mall, Noodle Pot is one of Las Vegas' hidden local gems. What's the appeal? Good home-cookin'. Their noodle soups and stews taste like Grandma has been slaving away all day in the kitchen so you can enjoy a delicious meal.  Portions are good for the price, although I personally wish it was smaller in size and a dollar or two cheaper. The joint itself is very small and homey, with almost all the patrons speaking exclusively in Chinese. The menu is fairly simple and easy to understand and service is relatively quick and painless.  I like this place enough, but not enough to crave it. The great thing is that their noodles are nicely cooked and I appreciate that they aren't too firm or too soft.",

They offered hot tea, which is nice for a fast food place (I always thought hot tea was mandatory at Chinese places, but I've discovered more and more places are trying to get away with charging for it..pfft). We also ordered the chive dumplings.  Food came out quickly, and it was flavorful, tasty, and not overdone with salt.   Only reason why I'm knocking off a star is the service. It seemed rather mixed - there was an older lady who was brusque while a younger server's kindness offset that attitude.   Will be back! Solid noodle shop, but bring cash!",

    "text": "So How did I find this place? Well my girlfriend and I wanted chinese food around 10pm, so i decided to drive to China town and Yelp what was nearby,. This is what came up.  I really wanted to like this place, I can get past that its basically a hole in the wall. A lot of these places are but the food wasnt that good here. We ordered the Beef noodle soup, it said that it would be spicy but it wasnt. It had a little flavor, but similar to pho it tasted strongly of cilantro. There wasn't a lot of beef, it was mostly fat and unchewable other pieces. The noodles we're good. If I just ordered this I'd prob give this place 3 stars.  We also ordered the Beef Stew Rice. For whatever reason It didn't register that we ordered Beef stew, We thought it would be beef fried rice. But it was what it said. Beef stew (which was just ok) served over white rice. It wasn't very good. I don't know if this is considered authentic Chinese or what, but it was just ok.   I have a feeling we should of ordered the dumplings. I will say the waitress was super nice and friendly.",

    "text": "Walked past this restaurant one evening with a bunch of Yelpers and was finally able to try it this weekend. After looking at there menu, I was surprised to find out the specialize in Taiwanese cuisine  What really caught my eye was the fact they have shaved ice, Taiwanese-style. The selection of additions is limited. They have all the usuals though: grass jelly, lemon jelly, red bean, green bean, taro, boba, pineapple, peach, and two or three others. Of course they have simple syrup and sweetened condensed milk. They advertise a special \"black sugar\" shaved ice, but that was not available both times I was there. There is only one size of shaved ice available and the price was under $6 for a large serving.  The other menu item that caught my eye was the beef noodle soup! You can get it with thin or wide noodles. On their menu, the option for \"hand-pulled\" noodles is listed, but after asking, the chef that does that was not there that day. Unfortunately, the dish itself was only average. The soup was not too salty, had good beef and star anise flavor, but it was also very, very oily. We ordered half meat, half tendon, it came to us more like quarter beef and three-quarter tendon. The meat was not braised long enough and was still a little tough. As for the tendon, they only had thinly sliced tendon, no big chunks, so it was very tender.   I also ordered their plum drink. It was not the style I liked, it was not brewed. Instead, they took the dried, salted plums and threw it into a pot of hot water along with some sugar, there were no other herbs or flavor to the drink.  Service was quick and friendly, they always kept my ice water full, so no complaints there. Overall, I would definitely come back for there shaved ice, especially on those hot summer days. I don't think I would go back for their beef noodle soup, but I would definitely like to try their other dishes: dumplings, pork chop rice, etc.",

    "text": "Where can I begin..... We wanted some authentic Chinese Noodle soup, so we went to China Town of course. Upon entering, we had high hopes, but as soon as the waitress opens her mouth, we know we came to the wrong place.  The older waitress was rude beyond belief, we  do speak Chinese, so communication wasn't an issue, but she kept on hurrying us when the restaurant wasn't that busy, and when my friend was choosing the small dishes in the fridge, she even said she's leaving if we can't make up our mind......... Now let's talk about the food.  I ordered the clear beef noodle soup, and when it arrived, it's Vietnamese Pho soup base with Chinese Beef Noodle soup ingredients, I have never tasted anything like it, and I hope I never will.  The soup base in all of our noodles are just too sweet from the msg, and the portions are not impressive either. I wonder how can they stay in business, maybe suckers like us out of town tourists was what kept them in business.  I will let all of our friends know to never visit the place again. And finally, they need to seriously hire or train their staffs to be nice to the customers, I don't care where they're from, basic service skill and attitude should be learned before working as waitresses.",

They refilled my water like 5 times when I was there (very dry tonight).    Went with a group and we shared the following:  1) Dry noodle dish ja jiang mein - their noodles are really great.  I'm not sure if the version we had was with the hand cut noodles but whatever it was it was great.  Noodles were nice and tender with just a little bit of a bite still to them.   2) One order of chive dumpings, one order of napa cabbage dumplings - yum.  Nice pork dumplings with your choice of veggies.  Meat was nice and flavorful.  Served with a soy sauce based sauce that was nice as well.   3) Soup dumplings  - delicious  Wish I could go into more detail but my knowledge of asian cooking techniques isn't really on par with my knowledge of Western cooking.  But everything was really delicious.  I will definitely be going back again and again.  My new favorite restaurant in Chinatown Las Vegas.",

    "text": "This reminds me of a spot I ate at in Beijing called \"Hao Chi Bu Gui\"  which means Good and Cheap!  Basically it's good home cooking that won't break the bank -   Dumplings, soup dumplings, noodle soups, cold dishes, etc.   I'll warn u - if you have an MSG intolerance then stay away.  But MSG and cheap Chinese food are like peas and carrots.  Live a little wrong and get multiple refills of H20.  The dumplings were very good - not dry on the inside and had a nice moistness.  The soup dumpling aren't like China Mama or the \"Xiao Long Bao\" as you all know.  It's basically 8 big dumplings in a bowl of soup which definitely had the most MSG kick to it.   Last, the service was great.  We were asked how our food was multiple times.   The waitresses even made conversation with us -  This was probably because the mother/daughter team wanted to tag-team my Taiwanese friend - HoCash.   Nevertheless the food and service were awesome which is why I'll be back and i encourage Yelpers to check this place out.  *EDIT*   the last 3-4 times i've been here the beef roll has really dissapointed.  they have been undercooking it and the roll is not crisp.  It's china town so ask with caution but u may wanna ask them to crisp it up b/c it s definitely better this way.    the boiled dumplings are always yummy",

The place is clean but, is a hole in the wall that just has good food!  I've ordered both the wonton and beef soup with thin noodles.  You have a choice of thin or wide noodles.  I also believe the noodles are home made!  I've also tried the breaded pork over rice.  Super good!  If you're down for some home made style soup I would say this is the best place in town.  I would give this place 5 stars if the interior was a little nicer and if they took credit cards.  Cash only =(",

    "text": "Yum, all I can say is YUM. Finally a small mom and pop store that sells authentic chinese noodles that actually taste good!  We ordered: 1) Beef Stew Soup Noodle (lamian)- wide noodles. Its a hearty, rich soup. Noodles are perfectly cooked, light and chewy goodness! Remember good korean & chinese noodles should have a bite, not soggy or too soft!  2) Pork Chop Rice- the pork was not greasy at all, the ran out of rice so they gave up a bowl of vegetable broth with bok choy and regular noodles. The broth was very very light & had a slight hint of an onion taste!  3) Zha Jian (lamian)- wide noodles. Its the orginal version of a korean chachang myeun. Sooo refreshing with the cucumbers lbean sprouts! This was my fav!  4) Boiled Dumpling (chives)- mmmm tastes like my mom's homemade dumpling. Chives & shrimp chunks.   5) Meat cold dish combination- marinated tripe, pork, tendon. The sauce they used has a nice, slight spiciness to compliment the meats.  Overall, my bf, friends and I would definitely come back here. We can't believe this place opened up last november. Also, you know they use real ingredients & not msg when you walk out without being thirsty :)   I've always been a supporter of mom and pop stores & this store deserves an A+!!!",

And then my parents would often bring take out back from their Henderson location.   One thing for certain is that they give you a nice hearty portion when you order their beef noodle soup. The bowl is giant, even when you order the take out version. A lot of the times, I can't finish an order myself. They give you a lot of noodles, which are cooked perfect -- it has a nice chewy, firm texture to it. They also give you plenty of beef but not all the beef is tender -- some are a bit tough but the flavor is great either way. The soup base is really good, probably filled with MSG but that's probably better than it being bland. The only thing is that I wish it was a bit spicier .. it wasn't very spicy. I typically have to add more chili paste/oil to it when I eat it.   What's great is that this place is usually opened until midnight. If you got some late night cravings, you can always come here. And by late night, I mean Cinderella late. The server that we had was really nice and quick. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to come.  They used to be cash only but now they have a machine that takes card :) So no worries, come with your plastics.",

They do speak English too though so don't be shy (I should take my own advice haha). Anyways, been here a few times and felt like it's time I finally wrote a review. We always get the beef stew soup with tendon whenever we visit. The only downside is that the taste of the soup tends to vary every time we come here. Some days, it's on the sweeter side while other days it's more spicy and savory. It's not consistent which is why I knock off a star. During today's visit we also got the smoked chicken rice dish which was good. You get a whole chicken leg. The chicken tasted great and it was tender. We also got the cabbage and pork dumplings. The dumplings are made in-house and steamed. Comes with a sweet soy sauce for dipping. It was nice a juicy. Overall this is a great place to visit especially on a cold day like today!",

Pretty sure what I paid for costs more.   It's on the other side of town and I ordered takeout so it is not a simple hop to fix.    I was the only other patron in there when they opened so there were not busy.  I suppose this means that someone who called in a takeout order also got the wrong one.  And it means I'll be untying the entire order and checking each one if I ever go back.   Very unfortunate and very disappointing.  Normally wouldn't gripe but I just spent the week saying how great this was to a friend who just came back into town and I was treating her.  So not a good outcome.",

However the service was not prompt and it wasn't like I was expecting it in a no-frills, run-by-FOBs type of establishment.   Forward to payment time and our server was dissatisfied with the tip I gave her and she had the nerve to ask for more and said if I didn't have enough on my card, \"you can also give me cash tip.\"  I was like WTF 'cause I've never heard that in my life and she should be lucky she got anything despite the dismal service.  The soup was delicious but I'm not returning! Girl BYE!",

Although I was tempted by a dry noodle dish or some dumplings I couldn't pass on the beef noodle soup. Got a side of marinated cucumbers, tasty. Oily, spicy, just like in Taiwan.   The beef noodle was excellent. The broth is thick and meaty with a deep flavor. Beef is so soft and the noodles are perfect. They have the \"qui qui\" (no idea how to spell that from Chinese) but the perfect chewiness that is so important for a proper beef noodle soup.  Highly recommend.",

We were reading some of the Yelpers reviews and gave it a shot! We wanted some beef noodles.  1.  The noodles - What the heck?  They did not buy this stuff from the store did they?  I found that the noodles here were white noodles , but slightly larger than the norm. The texture was awesome and the taste was literally a leap year from the regular noodles I have tried.  2.  Tenderloin Beef Noodle Soup - So delicate, tasty beef. Just the write cut of beef with a bit of tender fat and melt in your mouth beef.  The soup was very nice, subtle hints of the green onion and parsley gave it a very distinct flavor. This is what the wife ordered, but I kept on stealing a bit to give it a taste.  3.  Beef Stew Noodle Soup.  I love chinese style beef stew and this meat was the perfect balance of spice, taste, texture and delicacy. Would the word buttery be best to use?  This soup is slightly spicy, with a darker more salty flavor.  This is the first time I have drank the entire bowl of soup after the noodles and meat were finished off.  That is how good this soup was.  They have other items I haven't tried. The menu is a slip of paper with the items on it and you mark it off just similar to a sushi order sheet.  You kinda have to know what the noodles are and the other dishes are, or look at the pictures in the window.  I am coming back with the kids to try many more things, the dumplings, the fried noodles and etc.  GK says, check this place OUT!!!",

I stopped by for lunch and ordered the Zha Jiang Noodles.  This dish was very spicy, more than I expected.  The menu did have a chili pepper by the item, but I've never had Zha Jiang noodles that gave me the sweats.  Whoa buddy.  Besides that dish, I probably had the best beef rolls ever.  It was authentic style and they even added egg in it so it tasted like the Taiwanese breakfast Dan Bing.  Da Bomb yo!  Noodle pot taking it to the next Level baby! The only downside was it was really oily.  So you women prepare to start dabbing with your tissue.  I look forward to going back and trying the beef noodle that everyone is raving about.",

And she scribbled in Chinese letters on a piece of scrap paper at the bank the words for Liver Soup with noodles and I dutifully presented that to the cashier at Noodle Pot.  Ten minutes later I was immersed in a beautiful tasting broth with that wonderful fresh liver taste. Yum. Four stars for me. In coming back to try more.",

The beef soup is spicy, but oh so good ... the beef roll is delicious - made with a tortilla, eggs, beef, and cilantro - the dry noodles may look like ... well, dog food, but tastes great!  To add to the authentic flavor of Noodle Pot, there is always a TV on a Chinese game show.  Open until 12 on weeknights, 2 on weekends, but these a hours vary based on ... well, if they feel like it - or someone has not messed up the broth.  Oh yeah, prices, simple and cheap.",

    "text": "So far, my favorite noodle soup place in all of LV.  You get a choice between their thin noodles and thick noodles.  Never had the thick ones, but they look OK.  The thin noodles aren't like egg noodles or anything - it's more like udon thickness if I have to describe it.   I've had the beef noodle soup a few times and its pretty consistent.  The broth, although dark, is not very salty (the times that I've had it anyway) and had a good flavor.  The beef is very tender and melts in your mouth.   I've also tried their wonton soup, which is good, but pales in comparison to the beef noodle soup.  I wish they had siracha there - it would make my soup complete (but that's just my personal taste).   If you're in the mood for rice, don't hesitate to try to the pork chop over rice.  A breaded pork chop and it comes with some minced pork over the rice.  Very good!  I like to take the extra beef from my soup and eat it with the rice.   The place itself is pretty modest.  Nice service and normally quick, although last time we were here they forgot to give me my side of rice until the end of my meal when it was already pointless.  But I like the food so that's what keeps me coming back!   My only gripe is that they take cash only (which is inconvenient for a person that doesn't carry cash!).  Instead of going to an ATM, just walk over to the Ranch 99, buy something small, and get some cash back.    Anyway, a solid noodle spot.  I can't wait to take my dad, who is a beef noodle soup fanatic, here one day",

    "text": "YES YES YES YES! I hit the spot today. Went into the Chinatown Mall in Las Vegas today since it's a must visit place when your Chinese (well, this applies to any city). We were craving for some good Taiwanese food (something a little better than Tea Planet). This place hit the spot as we walked in.   It was very similar to Taiwan's family owned shops. You walk in and the menu is on the wall on top of the cashier. Order first, then choose the empty table that you want to sit at. As stated before, the place is a family owned restaurant. The lady behind the cashier seems to be a relative of the cooks in the kitchen.   Anyways, as we are waiting for the food... I observed the family owned business. They were super nice to all the customers. But one thing that strucked us was the Taiwanese spoken by the girl behind the counter. She had some funny mandarin mixed with broken Taiwanese. We were speaking to her in Taiwanese and correcting her as she goes. She wasn't mad at us or anything, but it made the wait time seem short.   Food on the other hand was excellent. I love the beef noodle soup! It was very close to what you can get in Taiwan. Broth was definitely tasty and the meat was juicy and tender. Noodles were thick and flat! Oh, and unlimited supply of preserved veges for the beef noodle soup! One more thing, try their dumplings and their cold dishes. Those hit the spot too. In fact, it was so good that I craved to go back for the next 5 days while I worked in Vegas.   They open til 2am on couple days of the week.  Go! you don't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Found this cozy little noodle shop while walking around looking for a decent (tasty but not too pricey) in this Chinatown plaza. I am a sucker for a good beef noodle soup, especially with thick chewy noodles, so that's three stars straight up ;) The noodles are hand-pulled and as a result are super long (think Rapunzel's hair) - like the whole bowl consists of about four noodle strands - and cooked just a little overdone, as they're a tad on the soggy side. But the broth is delicious, if a bit salty, with a generous helping of green onion and tender greens.  Then, we found out you could order more portions of noodles to put into your bowl for just $1 more. So good and so filling! My sister and I ate three portions and nearly had to be rolled out of the place. What a steal.  We also ordered their pork chop noodle soup - their regular thin noodles are just okay, also kind of soft - as well as pork chop rice and pig ears. All were tasty, with good breading on the pork chops, but definitely on the salty side. I drank copious amounts of water but had to flag down the waiters even when there was just one other group in the place. But it was almost 3pm when I was there so the older grandpas and grandmas that cook here were sitting down for a meal, but they jumped up when they found out we girls could eat. ha.  I'm definitely coming back here when I want a change from the buffets next time I'm in Vegas. They also offer free wifi but you have to ask for the password... and open till midnight every day and 2am on weekends? NICE. Noodles for all!",

As a Chinese customer myself, I was recommended by my friends to dine here.   That was a year ago. Things did not turn out pleasant. Let's say they do not take any credit cards or debit cards. It was OK, I promised my bud,it was my treat.I paid in cash. The total check was $35.  I left $45 on the tray ,which was 2 x 20 and. 1 x 5. (Leave her a $10 tip)  That shameless waitress took the tray,and she came back ,claiming that by saying that asuzing me only left 1 x 20 and 1 x 5 on the tray.   So instead of I tip her 10 bucks,I was short of her 10 dollars from the total check. I know how much money that I left on the tray(I am a BANK OF AMERICA CASH REWARDS CREDIT CARD FAN and I only carried $45 in total in my wallet on that day), she was rude and mistaken by mixing my money with other tables' change. I was even going to call 911 on the spot bcz she even refused to check her camera footage which there's a camera above the cashier register.    That night was the last night my dear bud in Vegas,thanks to that low intelligence waitress, he did not leave Vegas with a pleasant experience. He could testify me that I paid in full and left a generous tip in cash that night.  My recommendation to the fellow Yelpers.Do not come here to dine. I would give out 0 Star if there was an option.",

When we first walked in, it was super crowded. Every seat taken and a line out the door. However, the line moved pretty quick and by the time we got to the front, a table had cleared.   My friend had been many times so he suggested their famed Spicy Beef Noodle Stew. Another person ordered the one with tendons too, so I joined in this adventure and got the Spicy Beef and Tendon Stew.  Glad I did...it was delicious. Although my novice side showed, because when I eat these soups with noodles, I splatter juices all over me, the people at my table, and 3 tables over. :P Since I had somewhere to be afterwards and know of my rookie noodle eating skills, I was smart enough to wear a napkin bib. No, I didn't look like a tool at all. LOL!  Anyway, my friend also ordered the wontons in chili oil and they were delicious too! Definitely will be back with an old T-shirt or bib in hand! Yum!",

We were one of three parties in the restaurant and service was very hospitable and welcoming. Prices are a little high-my normal order of tendon beef noodle soup costs $10.99.

It makes the dish feel lighter and less carbo loaded. I thought the beef was tender and the broth was rich in flavor.  Generous meat proportions too.   Their spicy wontons were good. The chili oil is not actually that spicy though. Looks intense but it's pretty mild in nature. Doable if you can handle a little spice.    I thought their beef wraps were a little disappointing. There wasn't much flavor to it and the beef was a little chewy. I wish they put hoisin sauce in it to make it a little sweeter and saucier.   Overall I would come back again but I'll stick to my beef noodle soup.",

ALL the workers there are mainland and you can hear it in their tongue curling accents when they take your order.  Nothing here is authentic: The pork chop on rice, the beef noodle, the beef rolled in a pancake. All of which is their own spin-off and what you are used to in New York or California.  I say NY and LA  because nothing is as good as eating in Asia.   The earliest immigrants of Chinese people went to SF, then LA, then NY.  The Chinese food in Vegas off strip is just disappointing and made by a side cook, not a head chef.  Thier pork chop on rice is decent  The beef noodle is ok.  Anything else you are taking a chance.  The prices are a little on the steep side so I don't come here often.  Beef noodle is better at Shang, and no one else makes an edible pork chop on rice.    Chinese food is awful in Vegas.  My wife and I book an air BnB and drive back to Los Angeles for a weekend of good eats whenever we can.   NYC Chinatown is excellent too,  lived there for 30 years.  Vegas food standards suck outside of the strip.",

    "text": "FOOD:  Beef Noodle Soup  - they are known for their soup, and omg. This is one of the best noodles I've ever had: long, soft, and chewy, yet al dente. The beef tendon was definitely fresh and quality. It was soft with a nice chewy texture that melts in your mouth. The beef was perfect, better than my grandma's soup (sorry grams!) The broth was amazing as a stand alone, soul warming, savory and well rounded flavors, but I always add to my Asian soups out of habit. I love spicy, so I added like a tbsp (or two) of chili paste and a lot of sriracha hehe oh! And vinegar! You can't have Chinese noodle soup and not add a dash of vinegar. The portions are Large. When it first comes you think you couldn't possibly finish it, but you will! It's too good not to. 5 stars.  Chinese Chives Dumplings - I thought these were good, not amazing, but the family that treated me absolutely adore these dumplings. My friend thinks it's the perfect skin thickness and filling amount. personally, I love thick skinned dumplings, but to each their own~ I love the softness of the skin, and as a chives lover the filling was perfect, fresh with a hint a salt. 4 stars.  AMBIENCE  The usual small Chinese restaurant feels: casual yet intimate (in a platonic way) and a bit loud. There are small wooden tables and chairs, which can be pushed together for larger groups, the usual small bits of out of place flashy red and gold signs/decor and lots of happy chatty ppl. It can get a bit loud, but the small size of the place prevents it from becoming over the top.  SERVICE  Okay, it's a small Chinese/Taiwanese restaurant in Chinatown....service isn't great, but the food comes out timely and the place is always packed (from what I saw and what the family I dined with tells me) with only 1 server, potentially 2? Our waiter was very courteous, but we did have to walk up to the kitchen, only a handful of feet away from any of the tables, to add to our order or ask for refills on drinks. The place is a bit understaffed considering the huge lines (one for to go and one for dine in) outside the restaurant, and I came in 110 degree weather, so I wonder how much busier they are when the heat wave settles...  PARKING  FREE PARKING in the complex and right in front of the restaurant too! (Side note: it's within walking distance from 99 ranch to quench your Asian snack/drink/water needs). Also, I think Uber and Lyft are unfamiliar with the area, so make sure they drop you off at the right complex (pick ups and drop offs were confusing for them, but most did expect they'd be on the strip all night).  I'm basing my stars on food alone, 4.5 stars, and not on the ambience or service bc I don't think anyone rlly goes to these types of places expecting any different haha I know in the Asian community we mostly focus on taste, price, and value, and this hit it all! The food is inexpensive (I believe it was ~$60 for 5 ppl, not including tip, but Idk the exact amount since I didn't pay and couldn't see the bill bc, y'know, those stereotypical polite fights...) Anyway, I highly recommend this place! It will be my go to anytime I come back. And I look fwd to updating my review and trying their scallion pancakes and beef rolls? (Idk if that's the English name, but it's called  in Chinese), since those are the perfect snacks for drinking in Vegas.",

It is so cramped and you'll be elbow to elbow with strangers (literally, they put 2 of us at a 4 top with another couple because they had run out of room the last time we were here a few weeks ago. Grossed me out because the guy was hacking snot into his napkin and looking at it while we ate.)   This place really needs a bigger location. As is, it's too cramped for comfort. The do take cards now, but you will wait a long time for a seat and the soups are nothing to write home about. I did like that I could substitute out the noodles with a different type as I don't like traditional beef noodle soup noodles.",

    "text": "I use to frequent this location almost once a week which made me a regular. I go to West Charleston campus so this was my go to.   My gripe isn't the food but the service and management. So I ordered Beef Noodle Soup, which only a few minutes soon after, I grabbed the waitress's attention and requested my order to be substituted with wide noodles. Keep in mind, the food did not hit my table yet. The waitress said that it's already made (as in the kitchen) so my request had to be declined.   I'm never the one to feel entitled, I'm super understanding, and try to find a middle ground. Rather, she chose to shove this deal breaker to me. As this bowl of soup and noodles is skated onto my table, I'm just looking at my order as if it was forced upon me. I wasn't pleased as a customer, it wasn't the exact order which I had asked for, but yet, I'm expected to not only pay, but also eat it in misery. Out of all places, I chose Noodle Pot. And yet, this is how they chose to treat a regular. If they were smart about their business, with just a small accommodation, they could of made money on the ROI. As I continuously kept returning, especially with friends and family.  Long story short, I told the waitress/cashier lady that I don't think it's right to charge me for something I didn't eat. I initially was going to pay for my order but I pulled my card out because it didn't sit right with me. I said I didn't eat it because it is not what I requested as an order. She blamed me for not requesting wide noodles from the get go. She said she would modify my order and ring me up a new order as long as I paid for the first order. So essentially, she wanted me to pay for two orders. These bowls are $13 each. And I know they're also expecting a tip. She said she was the supervisor and I asked to speak to someone above her.   I was handed the phone with the manager to come to a resolution. As I'm explaining to the manager over the phone, he tells me that the waitress said that I've already ate the food. The phone was passed back and forth as they're speaking in Chinese and I'm explaining over the phone to the manager in English. Furious and frustrated, I told him that I'm not paying, and with that said, that I won't return back. The manager said and I quote, \"yeah don't comeback, we don't want people like you, but you still have to pay\". I wasn't going to leave cheated and hungry. And I didn't really want to simply walk out because it is not right. But I did coz i don't hand over my money to bad servicing cheaters.",

Although #1 is the most popular, my fave dish is their wonton noodle soup. I always add the hot chili oil that is placed on every table. This tops it off nicely and adds the right amount of heat. For menu add ons, I like to order the Beef Roll, Triple Delight, or Marinated Eggs.  Don't let the name \"Noodle Pot\" deceive you! Their menu also has rice dishes. I have tried a few and they are pretty good.  At first, the restaurant looks a lil outdated and should be remodeled, but it makes the place look that much more authentic. It's an overlooked establishment because of this. Their only focus is serving good food. :]",

I loved the noodles and the broth and the meat was pretty tender too, I drank the entire soup! Boyfriend said it was a bit too salty, but i still enjoyed it. The dry zha jiang mein was okay, but a bit too spicy for me. We also had the wonton with sauce and that was pretty good too.  Overall, I'd come back here for sure..

    "text": "I've lived in and traveled around China long enough to have developed a deep craving for beef noodle soup, and this place hits the spot. Amazingly delicious food can be found in the skeeziest looking shops over there. Most places, families live in the same run down shack as their \"restaurant\"; so you'll often find the owners' socks and undies drying in the bathroom. You'll be faced with a few basic tables with creaky little stools, a menu board on the wall, and not much else. It takes some getting used to, but I've now come to associate the dumpiest looking shacks with the promise of the most soulfoul food. Noodle Pot is not terribly dumpy, but it does have that basic noodle hut vibe. It's tiny and simple. The menu offerings are narrow. And the soup is hearty and plentiful. Eight bucks will get you a very substantial bowl of tender beef and noodles with the ubiquitous bok choy. Make sure to doctor it up with plenty of whatever is in the jars and bottles on the table (most likely dark vinegar, soy sauce, and chili paste). Then say so long, tuck in and disappear. The flavors are deep and satisfying, right on the money. One senses that many hours have gone into the rich broth and meltingly tender beef. The noodles don't appear to be hand made, as they lack the characteristic tenderness and touthsomeness. These are fine, but they don't make the dish which is all about the beef and the broth. Rather disappointing was the cold cucumber dish I ordered. In China the crushed cucumber dish is about as standard a way to begin a meal as the bread basket is in the west. Over there you will get fresh chunks of crunchy cukes dressed lightly with rice vinegar, and often accompanied by peanuts. Cold, crunchy, salty, a bit of sour--it's a freakishly addictive way to begin a meal. The one I received at Noodle Pot was a sad, pale version of the standard. The cucumbers were soft and wilted, with almost no crunch or flavor. They had clearly sat too long and should not have been served.   Service is a non-issue in a joint like this. The gals take your order, bring your food and largely ignore you unless you flag them down. This is the norm in China, where you have to shout at the servers to get their attention. It isn't considered rude for them to ignore you, or for you to holler across the room at them. It's all business here; you come in, sit down, order your dishes, and start slurping. The evening I came in plenty of folks were crowded around the tables, hunched over, slurping away. It's exactly how it should be in place like this, and its why I'll be back.",

I have been here about three times. Their wontons are different shapes every time, some times big and some times not.   Always wait for the uncle to be around to order your beef noodle soup because he tops the soup noodles with all of the extras just right and food tastes better with him around. His wife just doesn't do it as well as him, although the broth is the same, but inconsistency after excellency cannot be tolerated.   Am I coming back? Of course! I'll be waiting for the uncle.

My mother-in-law's soup noodles looked good.  My husband enjoyed his minced beef rice dish.  They also forgot about my husband's winter melon drink but they didn't charge us for it.  I was not happy with the service.  We were waiting to have our order taken but the waiter sat another party that had just walked in and he returned to take their order before us.  The food didn't take long to come out.  However, we waited too long for our check and so we went up to the cashier to try to pay but they were too busy so we had to wait at our table.  After a while, we went up again and and waited in front of the cashier to pay.  It is a tiny restaurant so it wasn't as if they didn't see us at our table.  This place is full of Asian tourists that come on the tour buses.",

Parking is free and never an issue and there is plenty of boba/dessert/bars to go to nearby.  The restaurant has less than 10 tables and no one seems to speak English. I'm glad my partner spoke Mandarin, because they seemed to become more welcoming once they knew we knew what we were doing. Whew.   The food is good and according to my Taiwanese friend, as authentic as you can get in Vegas. We ordered the noodles, beef roll and dumplings. The dumplings were good, but a little disappointing when I saw them pull out a giant bag of frozen dumplings from the freezer next to me. Do that where I can't see, guys.  Compared to Noodle Pot II, the food here is better. BUT Noodle Pot II is cleaner, newer, friendlier and more welcoming to those that aren't Chinese/Taiwanese food experts. Between the two locations, I would stick to Noodle Pot II.",

The beef and tendon noodle soup is to die for. Packed with flavor, this soup definitely brings a little heat to the palate too...but all in good form. The beef was fork tender and the tendon was just chewy enough and not a hair bit tough. The noodles were excellent too. Chewy without being too dense. Definitely a winner.  We also tried the pork and chive dumplings. Very standard, but still well done. The skin was not too thick nor floury and dumplings had good filling. The pork chop noodle soup was an excellent non-spicy counterpart to the spicy beef and tendon soup. The pork chop was juicy and charred to perfection. The only dish that I thought could have been better was the ja jiang mien. It just didn't have much flavor in my opinion.",

Prices here are cheap, and the service is friendly and fast.  I ordered the #2 with beef and tendon.  The broth is ultra savory and flavorful, and the quantity of meat is very generous.  There's just the right amount of spiciness too.  The beef is super tendor and absorbs all the flavor of the broth, and the tendon is soft and tasty as well.  There's also plenty of bits of vegetables that lend just a bit of texture and crunch to the overall dish.  This is about as good as any beef noodle soup can be.  The beef roll is just okay.  It's got an egg wrap and cucumber inside which is a bit different, but overall it's fine, just not really great or anything.  The cold wontons in chili sauce was just fine too.  Not a bad side at all, but nothing amazing either.  If you're craving beef noodle soup, this is definitely an terrific option.",

    "text": "After talking to Michael K about my previous negative and less than impressed experience here, we decided to come back so I could give it another try. Remembering that the chicken rice dishes here are trash I went with a beef tendon noodle soup, Mike went with beef noodle soup, and we shared an order of wontons in chili oil. Judging by the items ordered, I can say that this place is authentic, as their noodle soups are served simiarly to what you would find in Taiwan.  The beef tendon noodle soup ($8.99) was tasty, with a generous amount of tendon which is the best part! The broth itself was flavorful even though I asked them to make it less spicy for me. They have a spicy and non-spicy version of this dish by the way, so you can also get it mild. The noodles and tendon were soft, very tender and perfectly cooked. I would come back just for this soup alone.  The wontons in chili oil ($6.50) was also an impressive dish, and it too was served the traditional way. The chili oil gave the wontons a nice oily flavor but wasn't too overpowering or spicy by any means. The wontons were thin with a decent amount of pork wrapped inside.  The service here was a lot better than the last time around and our order was correct with no issues whatsoever. It was interesting that we were the only ones here at noon and then all of a sudden the place exploded and a huge rush of several different parties came in at the same time. This place is pretty solid for their authentic noodle soups, but that's all I would recommend here as an entree.",

Thanks to yelp, we found one in LV's Chinatown that's highly rated.   Service was very good. Specially accommodating a big group (w/ kids in tow) Food came out fast and the soups come out pipping hot.   Here's some of the rundown.  Beef and Tendon Stew Soup w/ Noodles (Spicy) - the soup was very flavorful, the noodles were perfect, the beef was super tender and delicious. The tendons on the other hand were very very tough. It's a shame, a 5 star soup became very disappointing.   Beef and Tendon Soup w/ noodles (not spicy) my wife's order was the same as my soup. Everything was good except the tendons. My sister in law had the same soup & she had tender tendons. (She got the first bowl) we got ours about 5 minutes after she got hers. I think the tendons were not yet ready. Like my wife said, 10 more minutes of cooking those tendons might have helped, I agree.   Crispy Chicken Leg Rice. Delicious. The chicken had a five spice rub concoction on it and it was fried perfectly. The rice had some mince pork & sauce on it. Yummy. It also came with half a hard boiled egg and a couple of vegi side dish, both very good as well. This dish was for my son, but me and my wife ended up eating the whole thing, sans the chicken skin which my boy scarfed down. I highly recommend this dish.   Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal. The kids specially liked the dumplings.   The hot soup certainly warmed us up at least enough to brave the cold LV night and back to our warm hotel.  I'll definitely be back",

It needed hot chili oil for some flavor. The cucumbers were okay, a nice portion for its price. The service was what you typically get at a Chinatown restaurant. I received no friendly greeting. A server simply walked up with a pen and paper, waiting for me to say what I wanted to eat. I had to flag them down to get the check after our meal. Overall, I wouldn't come back. There are better places to eat in Vegas.",

My mother is from Taiwan and I visit yearly to see family.  I grew up eating authentic Taiwanese cuisine which is the best Chinese cuisine in the world.  Sorry Hong Kong.  The spicy beef noodle soup is outstanding almost as good as the version in Taiwan which is quite famous. This place reminds me of my mother's home cooking with very traditional dishes.  The beef noodle soup is hearty and rich in beef flavor with succulent beef chunks including tendon, baby bok choy, pickled mustard, cilantro and just perfect noodles.  My favorite appetizer is the beef wrap with thin green onion egg pancake encased around marinated beef slices, cilantro with hoisin sauce.  And you must order the wontons with spicy chili sauce!  Being in Chinatown, service is pretty good and even better if you speak Chinese or Taiwanese.",

It did come with a good bit of vegetables. We also got pig's ear which was really tasty, very chewy. The wontons were reallllllly good! I would recommend them. The only complaint is that I asked for a tea refill, it was acknowledged, but not forthcoming. At that point I was pretty thirsty so was sad that I did not get more tea but it's not a deal breaker for this place. Aside from the lack of tea refill, service was really friendly and seemed like a nice family owned business. My sister and brother in law seem to enjoy their beef noodle soup (clear broth, not the spicy one because they're wusses and can't eat anything spicy). Other patrons seemed to be heartily diving into spicy beef noodle dishes so I'm sure it's delicious. I might come back if I'm ever out in the Vegas area again.",

I give it a 4.   the soup base was way too spicy, and noodle was very mushy.   I kindly told the store owner/ server that last time i came, the noodle didn't taste like this and was wondering what happened, I was just expecting a simple sorry, and we will make it better, or something like i can try to make it taste better right now. but no, he was like OH you came in at a very busy time, and we remake the soup and it's SUPPOSED TO TASTE A LITTLE DIFFERENT!   i swear the soup was too spicy for sake. i didn't even eat 1/5 of it. and Ima big time eat and I LOVE beef stew noodle, and it was that bad that I couldnt eat it.   the rest of the food were okay, but just the beef noodle was gross.  I'd like to just inform people that don't go in if they look busy, because the soup will just be too spicy, and it's supposed to be like that!   service was okay, a little slow during busy hours, but they're pretty nice, except for the part when they tried to make excuses for that noodle.",

Beef noodle soup was a common meal for me growing up so I've always sought after that grandmas recipe type that you could have anytime even if the weather was hot outside. I have to say, Noodle Pot is certainly high on my list for a solid bowl of Beef Noodle Soup. I've tried a couple other things in their menu including the Beef Roll and Spicy Chile Wontons, both of which are alright, but my go to here is always their Beef Noodle Soup. Ask for it to be made spicy even though it's not. It's just that if you don't, the broth comes out really bland. Great service and fast. Meal on the table in less than 5 minutes wait time. With it being right next to Diamond Bakery, it's a cant miss. I love to swing next door and grab some Portuguese Egg Custards.",

The soups are great, I particularly loved the beef stew with dumpling - they do a great job of cooking the beef so that it melts in your mouth and the spice isn't their just for spice's sake. The scallion pancakes are some of the best I've had. Just a great experience.",

We ordered a few noodle dishes, napa and pork dumplings, spicy wontons, scallion pancakes, beef rolls, fried pork chop, and pickled cucumbers. The dumplings, scallion pancakes, beef rolls, and pickled cucumbers are a must! The fried pork chop was very tasty as well, super tender and fatty. The spicy wontons were decent, could've used a little more flavor. The jajang noodles were a little overwhelming so we could've done without, but the noodles with tomato sauce were great.

We found that 2 of the dishes we ordered came in a chili oil sauce....this was found in the pickled cucumbers and dry noodle dish; it made both dishes quite oily. From our experience with pickled cucumbers it's usually only in a sesame and garlic sauce. The noodles were also quite oily and lacked any depth in taste; I added a little of the dumpling sauce to add a little saltiness to the dish and in my opinion that helped improve the taste. The beef roll was a lot bigger than we expected, but we were not used to the egg layer or the tendons in the beef which made it difficult to chew. The pork and chive dumplings was the only dish we enjoyed. Maybe their noodle soups would have been a better option but we probably won't be coming back because the dishes we ordered are generally what we like at Taiwanese restaurants.",

It was very flavorful and a bit on the spicy side. I didn't eat the beef because the chunks were too large though. They also had bok Choy in the soup.   The chili wontons were okay. I thought the filling could have been improved and the sauce wasn't that memorable.",

I also wanted to get away from the strip for a little bit so ventured over to the \"china town\" all along Spring Mountain. This place got great reviews for their nul ro mein and dumplings so I picked this place.   It's a smaller but cozy mom and pop with friendly servers. Although the hot tea was served in plastic water cups, it was pretty tasty and went perfectly with the meal. Unfortunately, they ran out of the wide noodles for the nul ro mein so I just went for the regular beef noodle soup sinced I didn't want the spice. The broth was light and slightly tangy from the pickled cucumbers. Even though I didn't have the thick noodles, the thin noodles were pretty good. They definitely tasted home made and a slight chew to them which I love. The beef was thinly sliced and somewhat rubbery/chewy - I was definitely not a fan.  Overall, I've had better bowls of noodle soup elsewhere and left slightly disappointed. Then again, I didn't have the spicy beef noodle soup or have the wide noodle either.",

Customer service was horrible, since I cannot leave the rating zero, I am forced to give them a one, but believe me I wouldn't go back if it was free!    Let me explain, we walked in for a hot bowl of noodles, and the place had maybe 8 tables of people.  We were shown a table and sat down, and that was it, no one came over to take our order, we were there maybe 10 minutes when a bus load of people came flooding through the doors and scrambling for free tables, they were placing orders and their food came flying out, one after another, it was horrific.  I finally got someones attention and they took our order.    Finally, our food came out but they kept pushing us around, first by asking that we move to a single table, we had been seated by them at a table for four, so we complied, then when my husband made his way to the counter to pay, I was still slurping my noodles, they showed people to sit at our table, I wasn't even done eating and they were pushing us out to make room for 'THE BUS' people.  I have never felt so unwanted, I was a paying customer too!  I wanted to sit and enjoy my meal, and yet I was rushed, pushed out of my seat!  I couldn't take it any more, I was livid, so I walked out, disgusted with the whole experience, and I will not go back!",

Earl hesitated to come here because we had a 7 course chef tasting dinner planned at 6pm, and it is already 2pm.    When we arrived, we were promptly greeted by the staff and was seated.  Choice between hot tea and water was offered, we opted for hot tea.  We ordered the two most talked about items on Yelp.  While we were waiting, Earl was intrigued by the Taiwanese variety show that was playing on the TV.  I, on the other hand, was intrigued with the big freezer that located inside the dining area, packed with frozen meat and trays of handmade wontons.   Onto the food:  -Beef and Tendon Noodle Soup:  We asked for extra bowls so we can share this.  This is a huge bowl of spicy flavorful broth with super tender chunks of beef and tendons.  There were also baby bok choy and pickled veggie in this bowl of goodness.    -Beef roll: tender slices of beef, egg and tons and tons of cilantro, with hoisin sauce, rolled up with a mu shu like wrapper.  There were two rolls, sliced in three sections, that came in an order.  We each had a section and took home the rest because we want to save room for dinner.  We had it for breakfast this morning and it was still delicious.  Service was awesome. Food we had was awesome. We will be coming back!",

This is not a fancy shmancy restaurant, but it's a great spot to get a quick fill of your noodle cravings and go.  They also seem to store their meats in the fridge in the dining area, which is a little strange, but nonetheless entertaining to see all the different kinds of meat they have stocked in there when they go to pull something out.  FOOD QUALITY: The noodle soup was delicious!!! I got the Wonton noodles and the broth was just perfect!  The wonton was tender and tasty and the noodles were melt in your mouth yummy!  The portion was also generous enough to satisfy my tummy.  Price was cheap too - I don't believe any of the noodles came out to be more than $8.    OVERALL: The noodles were so yummy, I would definitely put this place on the list to come back to for my next Vegas visit.  Plus, I now have another alternative if Pho Kim Long's line ever gets too long.",

Mild or spicy soup.  The hardest thing is finding the place.    Deconstructed:  Very well seasoned, deep beefy soup base with the wafting aroma of star anise, hint of ginger, and dried citrus peels.  Great noodles with just the right amount of chew.  Clean, tender, gelatinous tendons (sounds disgusting but \"a rose by any other name...\").  The only catch, the beef is sometimes over braised.  Tender, but dry.  Very common, I'd guess it's authentic by default.  Beef stew soup $8. Beef tendon soup $9.  Combo at $8.50  A simple meal doled out in a non descript restaurant with \"classic\" service (you got your food right?)  It is what it is and that's not bad at all.",

Hands down best beef noodles in Vegas, probably better than most beef noodles in the 626/909 area too. For a Taiwanese joint, this place is as authentic as it gets. The noodles are handmade and the perfect size. You don't find beef noodles with texture this good just anywhere. The broth is a little spicy (legit Taiwanese-style), so try the mild if you're scared of spicy shits.   The shrimp dumplings and wontons in chili sauce are delicious as well. Really reminds me of the ones you get in a Taiwanese night market. If you're down to try something new, I would also recommend the beef rolls.

I had the spicy beef and tendon noodle soup, and the noodles were not the thin rice noodles. It was hot and filling and the ramen style noodles paired with the spicy rich flavor of the broth and soft tendons was just the right amount of everything. 2 bowls and the appetizer was just under $25 so this place is now one of my top fave noodle houses.",

    "text": "I frequent this place about once a week to get my fill on Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup. It's the best I've ever had, though I am no \"expert\" on authentic taste. However, my friends who are much more in tune with the traditional flavor say that it is *very* good. This is primarily the dish I stick with, as it is their primary specialty, I believe.  Their beef, as compared to most places I've had in California, is tender, quality meat. A&J, a semi-chain, has these comparatively cheap pieces of beef with fat layered into it. I know which I prefer. The soup is very good, as are the noodles, and at 8 dollars a dish, you really can't go wrong as the meal is also very filling.  I've also enjoyed the beef rolls here - essentially sliced beef with some hoisin style sauce and a lot of cilantro-type herbs and egg wrapped into a thin pancake. They're really tasty as well.  Additionally, I do find that the owners and workers here are better than most hole-in-the-wall Taiwanese restaurants. Sometimes I could simply not stand the way I was treated at places like A&J.  A couple tips. CASH ONLY, and they often close before the listed closing time if they are not busy at all. Like potentially two hours early, so either call or be prepared to go early!",

    "text": "Whenever my Chinese in-laws are visiting from Hong Kong and we go to Chinese restaurants, I am always on the edge of my seat eagerly  awaiting for their opinion (and approval).  I had been here once before and really like it so I added it to the list of places to take them.  Well, I am proud to say that my taste buds were on point because they were big fans of Noodle Pot.    Most of the noodle restaurants in Chinatown are Cantonese style, but Noodle Pot is  traditional Taiwanese style. On both occasions, my husband and I shared the big bowl of the Beef and tendon stew noodle soup.  It is supposed to be spicy, but we also have to add more to appease our spice needs.  The noodles are made from scratch and hand pulled every morning. The beef and tendons are oh so tender, and the broth is bursting with flavor.    I highly recommend ordering the Beef Roll to accompany the noodle soup. The flavor combinations of the egg wrap, the cilantro, thin sliced beef, and hoisin sauce is perfection.  There are also cold dishes (pig ear, marinated cucumbers, seaweed, eggs, peanuts, etc) at the counter to accompany your noodles if you prefer.  In addition, they serve an assortment of dumplings which I have yet to try.   I am also a big fan of the rice dishes.  I ordered a crispy chicken plate for the kids and they loved it.  The steamed rice comes with some minced beef on top and some pickled vegetables on the side. But, the crispy chicken is the True star.   The restaurant is a True hole in the wall. (Our table was next to the freezer).  It may be difficult to find if you can't read Chinese. The Chinese Characters dominate the store front sign but be on the lookout for the tiny square of english words \"Noodle Pot\" in the corner.  The service is quick and friendly, and the flat screen TV is on a Chinese channel.  There are only a few tables inside and it is CASH ONLY, but it is a True GEM to Chinatown.",

Albeit this isn't a quality that I would wait in line for if I were in Taiwan, but here in the States, it doesn't get more real than this.  Beef noodle soup - meh, good broth and noodles, mediocre on the meat Veggies in garlic - good, tastes like any other asian sauteed veggie dish Spicy wonton - good, could be more spicy? Pork ears - amazing, it's so hard to find real pork ears... The ears here were not store bought, not excessively fatty, had cartilage in every piece, with good sauce. What else can I say? The ears tasted like they ought, which in America is actually high praise. Green bean soup - amazing. Again, not special, just authentic. Tastes just like how my grandma makes hers. Makes me miss home...  In summary, nothing special. Tastes like a mom and pop shop in any alley of Taipei Taiwan. But that's the crazy thing, tastes just like it does in Taiwan, not adulterated with western influences. Nothing against good American food, but sometimes I just appreciate real Chinese food too.",

Really good flavor, the meat was tough and with good flavor. But the one complaint that I had with the soup is a very serious one. The meat of the duck soup composed of the neck bone of the duck, and I couldn't enjoy eating it because I constantly had to spit them out and on top of that it was more bone/cartridge than meat.     But thats not my biggest concern is that those small neck bone pieces if not careful are a shocking hazard. I ignorantly shared half of the soup with my elderly mother and by some act of God none of those small neck bones feel into the soup when she was slurping it down. She could of shocked. To give you an image of how small and thick they were imagine it half the size of a small pebble stone. Or a piece of rice crispy cereal. I don't know if there duck soup always is composed of that part of the duck but if they continue to use just that part they will end up with a lawsuit by one of their customers.",

Only reason I brought it down to four was because the cold dishes we ordered on the side were atrocious. It was so evidently clear that they sat in the fridge for ages that I preferred to leave them untouched.   The cold dishes came out all stuck together and packed together like an ice cube. It actually took the use of a fork to break it apart because chopsticks were too flimsy for the job. Buuuuuut, the beef noodle stew...  Ahhh the beef noodle stew is exquisite. The amount of spices and herbs they use make this extremely tasty. Get the spicy variety as you will not regret it. Huge, bold flavor packed into one bowl, if you are craving beef noodle stew this is the place to go. The store doesn't have a sign outside so look for a place with a Pig as it's mascot (pig from the story Journey to the West).",

    "text": "I am always in search of a restaurant that serves really good beef noodle soups.  So I was excited to see the interior of this restaurant being put together a few months ago.  I finally came here with another Yelper for dinner and to give their food a try. The restaurant was not busy at all (I was the only in there while I waited for my friend), so service was quick when we placed our order.  I ordered the Beef Noodle with wide noodles $7.99.  The flavor was good,the noodles were chewy the way I like it, but the beef could have been braised longer.  I think China Mama and even Ay-Chung Noodle has better Beef Noodle Soup, so I will likely try something else here in the future.  My friend tried the Babo Mian, which he said was good.  $6.99  We also ordered an appetizer that was on one of the papers taped to the wall. The chicken was good, just a little pricey for the portion.  Overall, I thought the restaurant was decent.  The food was adequate. Price was alright.   WiFi is free, but there is no place to plug in your laptop.  Decor: 3/5  Nothing special.  Just a fast food restaurant kind of furniture and decorations. Food: 3/5  Okay, but definitely room for improvement. Service: 4/5  Efficient. Location:  4/5  In China Town.  Close enough for the tourists staying on the Strip, and locals wanting to eat at a restaurant on Spring Mtn.  Cash only, which my friend said was the reason why he didn't dine here sooner, as he didn't have cash when he initially came here.  I know it is a business decision to process credit cards payments, but it seems that it is a small business expense to cover to not lose potential businesses from those intending to pay with debit/credit cards.",

I did get the spicy beef and tendon noodle soup. I enjoy spicy food! I know we all have our own levels of heat but felt spicy was just right not over the top but still feel the kick. The amount of beef and tendon took me surprise with generous portions. I am fan of Pho. I get tendon in my Pho never get enough one piece or two if lucky. Here at Noodle Pot get bang for your buck. The broth was so heavenly no need add nothing else plus had small bok choy pieces in too. The noodles was great! I thinking be more like Pho much thicker noodle close too udon but thiner. I felt made the soup even more hearty with the bigger noodles. Yummy. I also ordered beef roll just cause first trip wanted try as much as I can. Another great dish on the menu. It heavy for starter just so you know. It something that never had before maybe because of the whole restaurant style. It looks more like crepe roll up with thinly sliced of tongue (I think) and lot of other good stuff lot of herbs/greens. You get two nice big rolls pre order. I would take beef roll over any spring roll.   The service say can be hit or miss depending on busy. I happen too during the lunch rush so kind of happy found spot. They only have one server/cashier and she does everything. Although too be honest the cook brought out my noodle soup since it was busy. It came too getting the bill if busy best bet just go right up too the cashier. If had anything pick at was since busy waited long time for bill. Two other tables that they just went right up too pay since taking little bit. Overall service was still very good.   The restaurant is pretty small so timing is everything. I do believe they do take out orders. Parking more then ample being located in Chinatown. If fan of noodles Noodle Pot is some place that need too check out. I know will be back. =))",

CASH ONLY  Prices were pretty fair !!! I ordered the zha jiang mian, and it was slightly different than what I'm used to seeing. It looked like minced pork on noodles here instead of the standard black bean stuff with cucumbers. While it was pretty good, it was not what I was expecting .. Also I think the egg was too salty.   The beef wraps were super good !!!! I highly recommend A+!!! But there is lots of cilantro in it for people who do not like cilantro! Also the pig ear and the marinated cucumbers were good.   Solid place and not super expensive !!",

The restaurant was jam packed though with Asians enjoying their noodles and dumplings.  We ordered their pork chop noodle, with what reminded me of Taiwanese style breaded fried pork chop on the side, beef and tendon noodle, and pork and napa dumplings. The dumplings were very mediocre and the dipping sauce looked like it had dried oregano floating on top.  The beef and tendon soup felt like it was pho, with sliced onions, cilantro, and bean sprouts.  Everything was tasty enough and we were very grateful to get our noodle fix taken care of, but it wasn't the best I've ever had.",

    "text": "My girl and I were out and about and stumbled upon Noodle Pot. Right on the entrance door is a Recognition Award noting that it's ranked 13th as the Best Chinese Food in America by a A Bite of America for 2018. Wowie Wow WOW WOWZERS! 13th?!?! That's it we were sold! We had to try it out!   I mean 13th in all of America?!?! If my calculations are correct there's gotta be at least 102 Chinese food places in the United States right? Two for each state and a 3 in Missouri and Alabama? Right? Cuz those Southerners love them some Chinese Food.  Anyways we walked in and the place was moderately packed. It was an early Friday night though. The inside is isn't too large and the food is apparently Taiwanese (Taiwan - the non-communist country). There are a few photos on the wall with numbers that correspond to numbers on the menu. The menu itself offered a good variety.  We wanted a rice dish and a noodle dish along with a couple of side dishes. Here's what we ordered and what we thought.  #12 Salty Duck Soup w/Noodle: The duck was delicious. Tender and portions were good. The noodle lacked flavor and didn't really add anything to the overall dish flavor-wise. It's like when you order a burger and get fries on the side, but the fries are the standard ones and not seasoned or extraordinary. So in this case the noodles were more like filler. I would say order the duck by itself and skip the noodles.  #29 Fried Pork Chop w/Rice: The pork chop was tasty and just the right amount of saltiness. The dish came with rice, a soy sauced hardboiled egg, sweet sausage, bean sprouts, spongy tofu thing, and pickled veggies. The serving size was large and the total dish was good and worth ordering.  #24 Wonton in Red Chili Sauce: This dish wasn't all that great. The chili sauce could've been spicier and the wontons were a bit bland. I've had better. I'd skip this order next time.  #26 Scallions Pancake: This is a pretty traditional dish that both of us enjoy. It's hard to screw up since it's so straightforward like sunny side eggs. We liked it since the pancakes were crispy but not stale or hard. I'd order this again.  The entire meal with what we ordered came out to be under $35 before tip. We both thought the food was okay. Can't say we're fans or we'd go out of our way to eat here again. Maybe if we're in the area and didn't want any of the other bountiful options available in Chinatown we'd drop in again. 3 stars and worth a visit if you've never been, but maybe not worth a second visit.",

Thankfully it is also old school in terms of cooking ability--homemade dumplings and soup were both good. I'd say neither were quite the best I've had in the US, but both were possibly the best versions I've had in Vegas.  Note that they list a $20 minimum for credit/debit, which is a real pain if you're dining alone. Hence the two items, which on the plus side did give me leftovers.",

We ordered 3 items to share family-style among 3 of us. Everything was so tasty that made me think twice about sharing after the first bite! The spiciness was spot on. The broth is so complex with chewy and cooked-to-perfection noodles. More people kept coming in as soon as a table left. We barely heard anything else but the sound of slurping and Chinese, which even further proved that this spot is legit! Thinking that this can't get any better, the bill came out around 30 bucks and I'm officially obsessed. Wish we had more room to stuff our face with more of their delicious noodles. We will definitely come back soon!",

This is almost as good as you can get! I have the Old Beijing style Zajiang noodle with pork this time. It is the best I ever had. It is so delicious! I guess I can eat it every day! Lol!

Parking is free and plentiful in the huge lot for this shopping center.  It's about 1 mile away from the strip so don't try to walk here unless it's not very hot outside.  It's worth checking out this restaurant not only for its good soup noodles but also because of the shopping center it is in.  There are lots of other great asian places here so it's worth the trip here from your hotel.  It certainly will be the best priced food you will find in Las Vegas!",

You sit and within minutes your big bowl of soup comes out very quick.  Don't be scared of the word spicy, because it's not at all spicy. It's just right even for me who can't handle spicy food.  Their garlic and veggies are also great. Freshly made!   The only reason why I deducted a star is because my his place is tiny. It can get super crowded and when you get a seat, you are all cramped and hardly able to move and eat.   Also, when you pay with a card, you have to pay in front because you need to sign from their iPad.  Other than that, this place is a must!",

Not that it gets cold too often in Vegas (or at least I don't think), but especially those cold winter nights, I'd probably go like 2-3 times a week.  That's how great their spicy beef and tendon noodle soup is to me.  I've had a great # of bowls of noodle soup...and their is really really good.  Thick-and-a-bit-chewy noodles, flavorful soup with a kick, cooked perfected tender beef tendon and large chunks of beef with the right mix of fat vs. lean.... oh and some veggies.  Anyways, I was really pleasantly surprised by the noodle soup.  We also ordered the beef roll and dumplings.  Beef roll has a bit of sweet taste (preference thing) which I didn't like.  But if you like a bit of sweetness in your food, you'll probably love it.  The dumplings were A-OK.  This is one of those hole in the wall, no frill type restaurants.  So I am a fan and would come back again for their beef noodle soup for sure the next time I am in town.",

    "text": "I remember coming here when it first opened 1-2 times and was not that impressed with the food. I also recalled hearing the microwave going off more than anything else before the food came out which made me avoid this place for the longest time.   Recently, one of my friend's friend had came into town and had loved coming here. We all came here for dinner one night before going to play pool and my opinion had been changed. Being one who loves food and eats mostly everything (there are a few exceptions...), I had to get the \"Stewed Beef & Tendon w/ Noodle in Spicy Beef Soup\". At $11.50 (as of mid 2018), the price seems to have jumped up quite a bit since opening.   Luckily, the last two visits, I haven't heard the microwave go off. Ahaha ! The soup is really flavorful and the noodles are good ! Holds the flavor of the soup really well but not be too soft itself. Topped with some preserved veggies (mmm wish they put more), the stewed beef is nice and tender. The tendon is oh so soft ! (though sometimes I wish it was more \"firm\" so it has a nice bite to it).   We had recently came back from an LA trip where we had some really good cold salted duck wings. We had ordered the \"Salted Duck\" here to try. Their version wasn't wings, but more like the duck breast area w/ bone. Flavor overall was still decent but portion size was much smaller for the price.   Overall, yummy beef noodle soup. I inhale it every time. Only downside is Cash only up to like $15, then credit is allowed. If you are a solo diner, bring cash or order more XD",

One type of cuisine they gets a bit underrepresented for us in Vegas though is Chinese food because we've had such great Chinese food in Vancouver and HK, we never really fave Vegas Chinese food a chance.  At the recommendation of one of our fellow travellers we decided to check this place out.  We were pleasantly surprised...Some good quality Taiwanese beef noodle soup, fried pork chop noodle soup, and beef pancake roll. The noodles were cooked just right with a perfect amount of al dente and the soup base was rich and flavourful. And also, very reasonably priced! Pro tip: you're coming here for the food, so don't expect a super tidy environment or great service!",

The noodles were soft and chewy (tasted very much like handmade noodles) , the broth was super flavorful, and there was plenty of green onions, veggies, and meat. The meat was very tender as well. The chives and pork dumplings were very very JUICY so be careful not to squirt the person next to you .  As for service, the young lady was super nice and polite. Food came out fast.  We went there 2 times in a row and wish we had discovered this place sooner. I would make another trip to Vegas just for this place, seriously.",

I had the beef and tendon. The meat was so soft I'm thinking it's beef cheek by sis says it's shank. The tendon is in large chunks and each chunk danced in my mouth with its jiggly self. Sooo good. Also tried the beef roll- thin sliced ribeye, cucumber slivers, egg, rolled into an egg/flour pancake. Tasty and refreshing! Glad to find this spot; we also had an order of potstickers and 4 of us ate (shares two soup bowls) for $44. Very good!",

(Note: Read the menu carefully and you'll notice the differences between the dishes that look similar.) When served, eat immediately in order enjoy the initial heat of the dish. Don't forget to eat the tendon. It's full of flavor and looks like a piece of fat if you are new to eating this type of dish. There's baby bok choy cabbage in there and some pickles as well to balance all the meat and noodle in the dish. I also try the mini dumplings. Spicy and tasty if you need a side dish.",

Though the tiny obscure sign helps disguise the restaurant quite well hehe. Look for the small \"Noodle Pot\" oval next to a looming sign in Chinese.   This restaurant tastes like...home. I always thought my mother didn't cook any specialty dishes (sorry for hating in the past, mom) but now I realize that everything she made for us was traditional Taiwanese style dishes! Which is exactly what this restaurant sells. You MUST go with the spicy beef noodle soup! The soup is hearty and rich in beef flavor. It is also heavier on the tomato side which some beef noodle soup enthusiasts might not be accustomed to, though it's exactly how my grandma makes it. The noodles they use are perfectly chewy, slightly wavy and neither too thin or thick and the beef chunks are tender and savory. It comes with plenty of baby bok choy and pickled mustard and cilantro.   For the side dishes I would recommend anything marinated! The cucumbers are garlicky, crunchy and refreshing while the cabbage is deliciously sour and spicy. My mouth is starting to water right now. Another must order is the beef wrap which is a thin green onion egg pancake wrapped around marinated beef slices, cilantro, and what seems like oyster sauce.  BUT THAT'S NOT ALL! You definitely need to order the chili oil wontons too. And all their dumplings are made in house. And finally the green bean (sweet mung bean, not the string variety) drink to top it all off! Noodle Pot is Taiwanese comfort food perfection.  P.S. More waitresses please. That is all.",

It beats the $14 bowl of beef noodle soup from Noodle Asia on the strip, but that doesn't say much... Anyway the beef is very flavorful, the noodles are chewy snd the soup is delicious. If you prefer spicier soup, just add the hot pepper sauce from the table. Not full after eating the first batch of noodles? Save some soup and ask for more nice chewy noodles! Service here is good, considering there's only one lady working the tables. She really tries to keep up with everyone.",

I tried asking the lady what \"parts\" were in the soup...not much English, so all I got was \"beef\" LOL.  Looked like knuckle/oxtail meat and tongue were in there...probably better I not know actually!

So when I keep hearing about this place and finally decided to give it a try, I was not impressed.   Here is what we got:  1. Spicy Beef Noodle Soup with stew beef - it had good flavor but nothing special. our bowl came with some tendons though which was hard to chew.  2. Plain Beef Noodle Soup with flank - very plain taste with random vegetables (almost looked like a bowl of Pho)  3. Sauteed season veggies with garlic - overcooked boy choy, very soggy.  4. Beef Roll - this I will give them credit for, it was pretty tasty, I like the addition of peanuts and egg in here, not your average beef roll. But it was pretty greasy.  The service was friendly and not too busy on a Friday night. But would I come here again? Probably not. You can find better beef noodle somewhere else in my opinion.",

This is a small location that serves a variety of noodles.  Gave it a try. Very disappointed(((   One of their BIG minuses is that they don't accept credit cards (only cash). After trying I can say that this is one of the worst Chinese restaurants I've ever been to. The service was really awful and slow. Nobody was smiling. The food was not good either. I had Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, that was not spicy at all and it was a little salty for my taste.  Will never come back again. Senseless waste of time and money.",

I could go on and on about the appetizers but the entrees are also good. Any of the beef noodle soups warm your soul. The fried pork chops are also excellent - even my picky kids will eat it. If you're not in the mood for noodles, they also have a beef stew you can get with rice.   They also have 3% off on Yelp :)",

They put so much wonton in my soup I had to share it. I'm not complaining about that at all. You definitely get a good punt for your money.  Like most Asian restaurants do not expect good service. The time on yelp says they close at midnight but they really stop serving at 11:30. So be prepared if you come late, the girl working is going to give you an attitude. I asked her what time they close and she said we had until midnight to eat. That was fine but the attitude wasn't necessary. I watched a guy come running in trying to order and she flat out said no. Luckily, I don't come to restaurants like this expecting good service. It's all about the food for me, and that makes up for the girl with the bad attitude who wants to go home a half hour before they are supposed to close. Haha!",

While I did not love my first plate of authentic Taiwanese food, my experience tells me these plates are steeped in tradition-- and just because \"I\" may not enjoy a certain food, doesn't mean it deserves a lesser review.   I finished my plate. Full. Something organic and grounded to their plates; bone-in chicken, with a heavy serving of rice, and sides of pickled cabbage (which I loved). But the smoked-on fat which covered the chicken, and a musky smoked in flavor was just too much for me. But again, I can see why this plate (among others) would be a favorite to many, and no surprise why \"A Bite of North America\" awarded them a Certificate of Recognition.",

You'll find it in Chinatown, in the mall, on the ground level, a little tucked away in a corner.  The night I went, it was a bit busy, but not packed (although we were asked to leave when we finished, as others were waiting).  The space is small, so large groups are going to have a hard time sitting and eating together.  My friend and I (who's lived in Vegas for four years), quickly found a seat and ordered right away.  We both got beef noodle soup and shared a place of pickled veggies.  What arrived was near perfection - hot bowl of broth with chewy sticky noodles and large chunks of beef sitting on top; oh and can't forget the green veggies!  Every bite was amazing, to the point you just slurp like a savage human and don't care what others think around you (because they're doing the same thing).  What else can I say, except that you'll get a hot bowl of beef noodle soup with complex flavors at a no bullsh*t price (*shrugs*).  Hit this place up, a short ride from the strip and under $30 for two peeps.",

Chinatown is kind of far for me, but I liked it that much and my boyfriend loved it too, even though I always just brought it home for him to try (to-go or leftovers). Some of their dishes are super delicious and authentic.  I would say the best things I've tried here are: -Beef Rolls- Its light and tasty, but eat it fresh! :)  -Clear Broth Beef Noodle Soup (make sure to get the one with chunks of beef vs. sliced beef) -Minced Pork over Rice- It was perfect and even had the pickled vegetables that I love so much  -Eggplant over rice (comes with fried egg) - Super flavorful and has meat bits in it  -THe spicy beef noodle soup was not spicy and lacked a savory taste. It's typically a soy sauce based soup, but it kind of tasted mostly like soy sauce. It wasn't bad, but the clear broth was significantly better.  -The pork over noodles was not MY personal cup of tea, but my boyfriend liked it. I added a large amount of the spicy sauce that they have on the table at the restaurant. (I also added that sauce to the eggplant over rice. It was good!) -The pork-cabbage dumplings were simply okay -The spicy wontons have a similar problem of too much soy sauce. Perhaps add some vinegar and some of the \"spicy\" sauce that they have on the table.   Parking can get crowded in this plaza around dinner time. They serve their hot tea in plastic cups, so try not to burn yourself. It's kind of a small restaurant so I don't recommend coming with especially large groups. Enjoy!",

I've been here twice before, first time I was very hungover second time I was not. Both times I ordered the spicy beef noodle soup. First time I was surprised about how flavorful the broth was. The beef was soft and noodles were chewy. The bowl exceeded my expectations. My second visit I came with high expectations but it didn't give me the same experience. Overall, very good noodle spot, especially if you tried all the other noodle restaurants in Vegas but it is not my favorite. I recommend a try.",

I'm usually too lazy to leave the strip and end up getting a $20 bowl of pho at Noodle Asia in the Venetian but I'm so glad we made the trip out to this restaurant. Between 3 girls, we ordered the spicy taiwanese beef noodle soup, beef rolls, and the minced pork over rice. The noodle soup was amazing, probably one of the better ones I've had. The broth was very rich and flavorful, and had the perfect amount of spice. Their homemade chili oil is also super bomb, so don't forget to use that. Perfect cure for a hangover, would definitely recommend coming here!",

All I got was noodles, some peanut sauce on top that literally tasted like peanut butter, and some onions. Like... what? It was extremely cold on top of it, felt like they took it straight from the fridge, dumped plain noodles and one spoon of peanut butter on top and some random onions. Even trying to mix it was hard because all the noodles were clumped together with the thick sauce. I could not eat it, tasted so garbage, I actually scraped off the sauce to remake it in a pan at home. Had to season it like crazy and then it was somewhat edible. Never going back for sure.",

It's a tiny restaurant with just 8 tables, but of course good things come in small packages.  I had to try the beef noodle soup, which was awesome. Rich, slightly spicy beef broth with tender chunks of beef along with medium sized Chinese noodles. It was the perfect bowl of soup on a slightly chilly December morning. We also tried the pork dumplings. I was full from my soup, but couldn't stop eating the dumplings as they are the style I like...the wrapper dough is not too think and just the right balance of pork and cabbage.   I also liked the fact that they have a sign inside that said they were voted #13 best Chinese restaurant in the US by a restaurant ratings group (can't remember which one).  The staff here was very kind and friendly. Definitely a must try when looking for beef noodle soup in Vegas.",

There are so many reviews about the beef noodle soup, but I really enjoyed the minced pork noodle dish which is more of a dry noodle dish. The bf is a very picky noodle eater, but he really enjoyed this restaurant and said it tastes like noodles in Taiwan. I just wasn't a fan of the beef roll. The outside wrapping was more of an egg-like crepe texture rather than the more carby wraps I am used to. Service was pleasant.",

The Chinese doughnut here is a star because it's actually made fresh and comes out super hot! This is so hard to find in most Chinese restaurants. I'd come back just for it.

    "text": "Prologue: One of the objectives for our recent trip to Las Vegas was to explore Chinatown more thoroughly then we had done in the past. We decided to give this place a try after reading some reviews and stopping by a few of the other restaurants in the vicinity.  The Plot: We began by sharing and order of Chives & Pork Dumplings, which was followed by two entrees, including a bowl of Beef Soup with Bean Thread Noodle and Simmered Pig Feet.  The Scene: The dumplings were steamed properly, the wrappers were firm yet still delicate, and the ground pork and broth inside were very tasty and nicely seasoned.  The consistency of the soup noodles and meat was spot on for us and the broth was just spicy enough.  The Rest of the Story: My fiancee, who is a native of mainland China, thought at the size of the dumplings was too small. I would have to agree, especially considering that this is a noodle house.  We also thought there was plenty of room in the soup bowl for a lot more noodles then we got.  The pigs feet, though very tasty, we're not fall off the bone tender and the flavor was not rich enough to satisfy my craving when ordering this dish.  The service was prompt in courteous. My fiancee thought the prices were a little high considering the portion sizes.  Epilogue: We will carry on with our exploration of Chinatown on our next visit to Las Vegas.

    "text": "If your looking for beef and broccoli, orange chicken,or chow main..take your ass to Panda Express! Lol Noodle Pot does not serve any of that here. If your looking for more authentic foods and flavors of Chinese cuisine than this is your spot! Located in a  strip mall inside China town its a very small hole in the wall joint that does noodle dishes and soups right.   This place isn't fancy or beautiful but when I walked in there were a lot of customers eating and that's a good sign because I can almost guarantee most or half of them are repeat customers. But anyways we were immediately greeted by one of their employees and seated immediately. Once I saw the menu I knew this place isn't your commercial Chinese food spot. They stayed True to there roots which I respect!  We ordered then no less than 10 mins later we received our food.   Let me tell you the portion sizes of these dishes are insanely large lol ,and most of the items on the menu are less than 12 dollars. I'm pretty sure I didn't see one dish over 13 dollars lol. Now the way Chinese eat they like to share so you don't have to order individually they will provide you with small plates and bowls with out even asking them , I'm pretty sure they encourage it lol.   So we had 3 dishes . Dish 1 was their Beef &tendon noodle soup with spicy broth , the meat is so tender and juicy you can literally tear it apart with a spoon. The broth is super rich and the noodles are springy and hold the broth nicely. Definitely something I could eat everyday lol. Dish 2 was their popular beef rolls and man these things are huge lol. I loved them and the cucumber inside delivers a crisp fresh flavor, now it is a little too sweet for my liking however i would loved it if there were raw jalapeno slices but that's just my opinion. Dish 3 was the braised beef and noodle dry dish, this dish is basically an Asian take on spaghetti lol. It was super good very meaty with small tofu chucks , the sauce sticks to the noodles perfectly and tastes amazing.  I really want to give this place 5 stars but the location might be hard to find for some and the decor is lacking immensely. But other than that this place delivers a great home made feel and food. This is a True china town gem.I would  and will definitely be coming back. I do recommend GO GO GO!!",

We were looking for Chinese food originally, but he walked inside, just to take a peek. When he came back out, he was like, \"Oh yeah. This looks good.\"  No doubt, he was spot on. I was a little bit skeptical at first, seeing that their mascot is some weird-looking pig, who is standing on his hind legs and holding a chicken drumstick in his hand. WEIRD. I giggled incessantly, but still decided to give it a chance.  Man, when the flavor of the soup broth hits you... Wow. It looks watery, but as soon as you sip a little bit (yes, just a teeny-tiny bit, because the soup is served the same temperature as the surface of the sun), it \"whams\" you in the mouth with a meaty punch.   I usually get the beef stew soup, but the man always gets either Beef and Tendon, or just the Tendon. I have been about four or five times now, and the consistency is always the same. Lots of tendon/beef, lots of flavor.   For all you Pho fans out there, it's a nice break from the norm, especially is you are looking for something a little hardier and meatier. This is gonna be an absolute staple place for me this coming winter.  PS- If you are lucky (like I was, one fateful evening), you might even run into the Duchess herself, Yuhi K. dining here!",

The spice might seem really intense but it was the right amount! The classic beef noodles costs $9 which is a little expensive but the taste makes up for it.   Be prepared for a wait to be seated!!! And it got so busy in the store where many people were standing around making the small dining area even smaller and I had conflicts with my neighboring table because of the confined space. Also, there were only two waitresses taking orders, serving food, and working the register... That was clearly not enough. I had to wait 5 minutes for a take out box!  But still, despite the wait and the cost, I had a really delicious bowl of Taiwanese beef noodles on this wintry day!",

    "text": "Not a bad Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup...  From yelping around in Las Vegas, looking for a place that was still open late night, and targeting restaurants that had noodles...this establishment was the one that I chose for our intoxicated food adventure.  I was lured to this location not only because of the high ratings, but because of their advertisement of hand-made noodles.  The noodles were guud, indeed, they were very guud (especially because of the inebriation factor). The soup was flavorful and not very oily. The prices were very fair and the location is open till midnight. Service was very quick and pleasant.  Im usually a PHO-type of guy when it comes to drunk munchies, but after eating here, this place isnt a bad substitute.  RECOMMENDED!  UNTIL THEN!! ^-^",

When I was trying to find it, I did not know that it was the main Chinatown plaza. A hole-in-the-wall place right by that Optometrist place. Yeah, I had a little trouble finding it, haha. OOPS. Should've read the reviews more thoroughly!  I'd like to try their beef rolls some other time and maybe some other soup. For now, it's decent enough. Good enough. It's perfect coming at night (opens till 2am on Fri-Sat, and 12am the rest of the week) or when it starts to get cold again.  Worth a try at least once! :)",

We had the spicy beef noodle soup and the wonton noodle soup. The broth for both weren't too salty and had a good bit of flavor to them. The wontons were smaller than what I'm used to, but everything in LA comes supersized already. The beef rolls were wrapped in some sort of thin flour mixed with egg and was quite delicious. I also enjoyed the pork chop which was charred to perfection and has some good taste to it.   Overall, the experience was great with their speedy service, polite waitresses, and otherwise brutally long waits in the buffet lines. I'd come here again if I ever encounter long buffet lines!",

    "text": "Many Las Vegans have declared that pursuing authentic Taiwanese food in this town is like finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. My ever-growing curiosity in this uniquely ethnic cuisine, as well as guidance from people who are knowledgeable about this food has led me to Noodle Pot. I can say, without a shadow of doubt, that this establishment has superseded  my expectations!  Following a brief stop at the Shavery, I ran into Will (a.k.a. the artist formerly known as SnowFlake), along with a couple of Yelper's, and we decided to go to Noodle Pot. I have driven past this joint many times without thinking twice to stop in. It was a startling revelation to learn that, according to Will, Noodle Pot has some truly legitimate  Taiwanese grub in Vegas. Most notably, I wanted to try the national dish of Taiwan, spicy beef noodle soup.  I admire extraordinary mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall resto's, and Noodle Pot fits the bill to a tee. The comfortable yet lively vibe keeps the interaction going. After the server sat us down, we ordered some appetizers along with the spicy beef noodle soup.  Cold Vegetable Appetizer Plate - The first time I ordered this it came with pickled cucumbers and other vegetables, and wheat gluten. The cucumbers were marvelous, with the correct amount of saltiness to harmonize with the sweetness used in the sauce. The wheat gluten was another smash hit. It tasted incredibly akin to a concoction of beef and chicken.   (Note: Coming here on a separate visit, and ordering this dish again, they had replaced the wheat gluten with soy sauce hard-boiled eggs. I notably did not enjoy them, and I was not too confident to which tree the egg grows on, but that's just me ((hehe)).  Pork and Chive Dumplings - Another sublime feature! The dumpling wrappers tasted hand made, and the filling inside was outstanding with perfectly tender pork matching the bright flavor of the chives. The vinegary soy sauce dip was the icing on the cake.  Beef Roll - My least favorite item, but pretty splendid nonetheless. Slices of beef and cilantro wrapped around a thin crepe. I actually prefer other Chinese versions that use a thicker, flakier scallion pancake in which the inside is coated with hoisin sauce. But, it was delish.  Spicy Beef Noodle Soup - the \"Piece de resistance\" to our meal. We opted for the wide noodles instead of the regular noodles (think of it as thicker version of pappardelle). The noodles were perceived as if they were hand made and hand pulled, even though they probably came from a special noodle factory. The broth was nuts! It was packed with beef flavor, but exceptionally delicate. Hints of tomato added depth. Large portions of tender beef dotted the soup. Also, if the server has not brought out the chopped pickled cilantro, ask for it. That combined with the baby bok choy in the soup will give the dish a marvelous variation!  Many have mentioned this before, but I will proclaim it again. CASH ONLY!!! Save the plastic for the surgeon's table! :D  (Another side note: I took my brother here when he visited and at the time they had run out of beef so we opted for the Spicy Beef Tendon Soup. Even though I was fine, my brother returned home and had the hershey squirts for the next few days. The soup comes with a tremendous amount of tendons, so if you are not used to eating lots of offal or weird animal bits, I would be cautious when ordering this version).",

Ordered a bowl of their signature beef noodle soup (in English on the menu overhead it all says \"beef noodle soup\" but they come with different things, like tendon, beef, etc.). We were seated right away as there was a table available, but while we were waiting for our food, a woman asked if someone was sitting there. We said no, and she plopped herself down while her hubby ordered food. We thought she just needed to get off her feet, but nope she was settling down and her husband sat right next to her. Okay, then.  Our beef noodle soup was okay, but they made it spicy at first and then said it only comes that way. I told her that the waitress said that they could make it non-spicy so then it took a while to come out. There are only about 10 tables in there, so don't expect to get seated right away if they're busy. We ordered the pork chop rice and when it came, I was like, \"Where's the batter?\" That's the first time in my life that I've ordered pork chop rice and it came like it was broiled. Weird. It tasted okay, but it's like going to KFC and ordering fried chicken and you come home and open the bucket and it's grilled chicken. Sucks.  It was about $8 each and you get plenty of food, but the noodles weren't the homemade kind I like and they weren't QQ enough. You know what I mean. Probably won't go back next time I'm in Vegas. I did like that they spoke Taiwanese and Mandarin though, and they were very nice there.",

    "text": "Although I am not a big fan of beef noodles, I still wanted to come here and try their other dish. I ordered pig feet (i know, sounds scary) noodle soup.  I was not very impressed with it.  They were only 3 medium size pig feet in the soup, so it was not very filling.  I think the beef noodle soup would've been more filling.  But this place seems to be very popular as people kept coming in.  The turn over rate is pretty fast, so even if there is a line, i wouldn't think the wait would be too long.   If you are sick of buffets on the strip and feel like some hot (both temperature and spice) beef noodle soup, come and try this place.",

My family of 4 walked in, stood there for a few minutes and when the lady didn't move from behind the counter or respond back when we said hello we decided we'll just sit ourselves in front by the cooler/window. She finally came out and hard-highhandedly tossed the menus across the table causing the condiments at the other end to knock over.  We just assumed that it was an accident but she didn't say anything, look at us, or even offer napkins to clean the mess of chili oil on the table.  Waited over 10mins for her to take our order, and in this time she had helped/chatted/served a new group of 4 super quick.  I went to the counter and waited for her to approach the register so I can order.  When she did, it was when the 1st group of 6 came up to pay.  She blew me off and reached pass me to grab his money.  As soon as they got their change back, she went straight to a new group of 2 that just sat down.    I guess she couldn't see my 200lbs stature or no one informed her that when running a business GREEN is the only color that matters.",

I haven't had much else on the menu despite going there once every few weeks, but the beef rolls are pretty solid too.  The restauarant is a bit tough to find (it's on the western end of the Chinatown Plaza Mall), but once you get there you're in for a treat. There's not much in the way of decor or service (not bad, just basic), but you go to Noodle Pot for the food.  Tip: ask for thick noodles",

Beef noodle soup was great, just as good as Beijing Noodle (maybe even a tad bit better, cuz this soup was spicier). Hot oil chili was good but wasn't spicy enough. Price was great!

The pork chop noodle was also very good. It is a milder soup but the saltiness of the pork chop helps to balance it. The house-made chili gives everything the perfect kick and the burn pleasantly creeps up on you. The wontons in red sauce are also spectacular. I believe the red sauce has a vinegar base with hints of sweet and spicy. The restaurant is the perfect place to go during the winter.",

    "text": "Best place I've come across for Taiwanese beef noodle soup in Vegas thus far.   Always a good sign when I walk into a Chinese restaurant and they assume I'm a native speaker right off the bat so I'm happy to play the role of the fobby young immigrant looking for an oasis of good eats in the desert reminding him of the motherland (or mother island, depending on your politics).    My two times here I've gotten the spicy beef noodle soup and the pork feet noodle soup, both leaving me satisfied with warm soup belly and no residual sense of being parched from excessive MSG/salt.    The noodles offered come in two varieties: thin (nice Q-Q quality with an udon like consistency) and the thick hand-cut variety that are like nice al-dente dumpling strips).  The broth for the beef noodle soup has good balance in spice from the star anise/peppercorns with a lingering sweet finish and the beef is braised fork-tender (chopstick tender?) with plenty of marbled fatty goodness and accompanying tendon pieces that have been cooked down to the perfect chewy consistency.  If you're feeling a bit more adventurous and need to save a few extra bucks, the pork feet noodle soup is a bargain considering it is 2 dollars cheaper than the beef noodle soup and is loaded with large cartilaginous hunks of the soup's namesake that are braised so that everything falls off the bones with minimal effort.  The broth has a nice mild sweetness and the accompanying bok choy provides a nice contrast in crunch/color.  Probably not the best soup to order if you're on a date or if an attractive customer is sitting in front of you since this is one of those dishes you just need to go to town gnawing away and discarding the small bones aside every few bites, so just be comfortable in your own world of pork-liciousness.    Lots of other taiwanese classics and small cold plates at the counter, so definitely planning a return trip in the near future.  Cash only!",

Broth was perfect. Not too salty and just spicy enough!  Btw, the portion was so big for the spicy beef noodle that one bowl is enough for two. We made the mistake of ordering two noodle bowls and had to take the leftovers home which we did so gladly. I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers... And even soggy and day old it was still delicious! Being of Taiwanese decent I was so pleasantly surprised that this was a Taiwan style noodle shop. Almost all the customers spoke Mandarin which must mean that they serve good authentic Taiwanese food. I hope I can take my Taiwanese relatives here next time they visit Vegas. I can't wait to go back! Now on my favorites list of Vegas. =)",

The place is no frills except for free Wifi (Yay!), so not a place that you'd likely want to take a date to.  Otherwise service is acceptable, they're pretty quick to refill your water and get you anything.  Had to ask for extra napkins.  Located in the heart of Las Vegas Chinatown in the same place as Ranch 99.  The food was really good, so I'll probably go back.",

Probably not as good as some of the noodle places I've had in the 626, but not too bad if you're in Vegas and you're craving some soup noodles.   Prices are decent, ~$8-9, after tax and tip.",

We had the spicy beef noodle soup and spicy beef with dumplings. Both were excellent but so exceptionally spicy that your face falls off. Excellent lunch!!",

The spicy beef and tendon noodle soup was flavorful and had a nice kick to soothe my hangover from the night before. Would also be perfect when suffering from a cold or flu or allergies.   Wontons in chili oil were not spicy at all and a bit ugly to be honest but delicious nonetheless.   Boiled dumplings with shrimp beef and pork were not my fave. Will try the pork next time.",

Staff was exceptionally nice both times I ate here, but also keep in mind that Taiwan-style (and other Asian countries) is to let them know when you need something, not for them to come check on you.   Get the beef noodle soup with half tendon and half meat, just a little bit spicy. (I think it's #2.) Done well and finished with bok choy, cilantro, and a small bit of pickled vegetable. Only \"problem\" is that noodles come out exactly cooked and thereby end up slightly overdone by the time you reach the bottom of your bowl, but not sure how that's avoidable.   Seaweed and braised pork ear are both excellent here as well.   For those as bloody lost as I was while looking for this place, it's in the same complex as Volcano on the far right side, next door to the bakery. The English sign is SMALL!  Like all first generation Asian places, this place doesn't accept credit card unless you hit a min, which is $20 here. God forbid... Anyway, happy eating!",

Noodle Pot is located in Chinatown of Las Vegas, in a small shopping center, and is always busy with customers when I go. It seats about 40 people on the inside, so if you are going with a pretty big party (6+) at a peak time, I would say be prepared to wait a bit, but the food is definitely worth the wait.  Even when it is busy and I order the  (No. 1) on the menu and other people in my party order other dishes, the food never takes more than 10 or 15 minutes to come out. The store sells other Taiwanese side and main dishes that taste delicious as well, but none as good as the beef noodle soup.  The store has free wifi, and for all you Pokemon Go fans, is located close to three Pokestops as well. But don't just come for the free wifi, definitely try some soup as well!",

Parking can be painful here during peak hours but I was fortunate to locate a good spot.  I've been avoiding spicy food since it irritates my PV illness so I ordered the regular beef noodle soup. The soup was decent but overall I prefer the spicy beef noodle soup. Another con here is it's cash only.  I doubt I'll return since there are so many other noodle houses that offer better quality and accept plastic!",

The server brought many of our items to the table with his fingers in the dish. We got our drinks halfway through the meal and had to ask multiple times for napkins and utensils. While eating the server thought it would be a good idea to restock the utensils and put his armpit on my head whilst i was in mid bite. While trying to pay the cashiers was extremely rude and added her own tip to all of our cards individually. And when confronted about it she gave some sort half a** response saying it policy. Which apparently didn't apply to people paying with cash. Will not be returning here ever.",

Spicy wonton: 4 stars- chili sauce wonton with pork inside. Very good dish and not too spicy. Great flavors.  Minced pork noodle soup: 2 stars- let me explain the 2 stars. I was set on eating this dish which had tasty soup broth from the minced meat but for me it's all about the noodles. I had been to the other location in Henderson and the thick wide cut chewy noodles is what made the dish. Unfortunately they didn't have the wide chewy noodles so the dish was just not the same.   I've been to this location more than once and have not gotten the same sort of high quality I feel they have produced at their 2nd location.",

Other dishes we sampled were pig ears and spicy wontons. I'd say they were decent but nothing memorable. The pig ears were too heavily drenched in spicy oil. The wontons were not filling enough if you treat it as an entree but as appetizer it's good size to share.   Also note, the beef noodle soup is large enough to split between 2 people. Otherwise it is an enormous portion so come hungry if you plan to eat it by yourself.",

We ordered the napa and pork dumplings, 2 x beef and tendon noodle soup, braised pork rice, grilled bok choy, and cold vegetables.   We were pleasantly surprised by how good this Taiwanese place was and very comparable to the Bay Area. The beef and tendon noodle soup was my favorite dish here. It had so many noodles and it was quite chewy and long. The broth was extremely flavorful albeit a bit salty. The cold vegetables were indeed very cold. Tofu, pickled cucumber, and seaweed tasted like it had just been defrosted. Grilled bok choy had plenty of garlic on it  and is a solid vegetable dish.   The amount of food was perfect for 4 people. I'd love to come back here next time I'm in town.",

My partner and I ordered the Spicy beef soup with stewed beef and tendon, fried pork chop with rice, and pork and chive dumplings. The soup was so flavorful and the pieces of meat and tendon were huge. The dumplings were very good especially since we love the strong taste of chives. Lastly, the pork chop dish was delicious; the pork was perfectly fried and came with all the typical sides (veggies and tea egg). The reason I gave this place a 4 was because my partner is Taiwanese and has high standards for fried pork chop dishes--we didn't like how it was served with the bone. Otherwise, everything tasted amazing!",

They recently started accepting credit/debit cards (over $20), which should allow them to increase their business. I usually order the traditional Spicy Beef Noodle Soup aka: #1 on the menu. The noodles are freshly made and very soft and tender. The soup broth has so much flavor with herbs and a good portion of meat. The only thing is sometimes they put too much soup (which I don't mind), or they don't put enough; so if you like to have a very tasty soup and they don't put enough soup broth in it; just ask and they will add more soup broth.   My wife always orders the Minced Pork Noodles which is a dry soup with a creamy pork creation poured over the dry noodles (again - made freshly in house). Then we the won-ton in chili soy sauce which will compliment any entree you order if you like a little kick to the meal. Drinks are limited in terms of selection but water is usually the best beverage since some of the dishes have that kick.",

    "text": "Ok, this place seriously has the best wonton noodle soup we have ever tasted. Spring Mountain or also known as China Town of Las Vegas is filled with many Asian restaurants. Noodle Pot is located in one of the many plazas in Spring Mountain. It's approximately 10-15 minutes drive off the strip. Very convenient drive as there are many routes you can take to get here.  The restaurant is family owned so it is small but they have enough space to sit comfortably. They only have one size and it is large enough to feed two semi hungry people and fulfilling for one starving person. The max we waited for our food to come after we ordered was about 10-15 minutes so it is pretty fast.   We all ordered wonton noodle soup. You can pick which type of noodle you want in your soup. We ordered the flat noodle. I'm salivating as I write this review and sad that I don't have this place near by. I have nothing bad to say at all and all the good things could take ages to write. Since continuing to write about how good it is is making me yearn for it some more, I will end the review with, trust me, it is really that good!  Note: there is a bakery next door so after lunch or dinner you can grab some pastries and yummy pineapple bread to take back to your hotel. Perfect for after club snacks!",

Order some spicy dumplings as a side dish along with a cold drink or tea and you have a complete meal.  The dumplings are optional if you don't eat that much.",

    "text": "As the current reigning  duchess of Noodle Pot, I think I'm due for a review. I come here for one thing and one thing only--their best seller, Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup.  The noodles are usually cooked soft with just a bit of bite. If it were up to me, I would prefer them a little more chewy. But the broth has a light to medium body and is packed full of flavor and I can honestly say that the broth alone makes up for a limp noodle. On top of it all, the braised beef and tendon are always tender and delicious. And it's all served with a healthy serving of fresh and pickled vegetables. After trying a few other noodle dishes here, I came to the conclusion I don't like any of it. But if I'm feeling frisky, I'll mix in a Beef Roll with my noodle soup. Noodle Pot's beef roll is a popular Taiwanese finger food. Scallion, cilantro, sweet/savory hoisin sauce, and tender chunks of beef shank are rolled in a slightly chewy pancake. At first glance, I would compare it to a crepe-like burrito. I suggest digging in with your hands and dipping in a bit of black vinegar. Delicious!  Decor is your typical no-frills, family-owned, Asian hole-in-the-wall. Nothing fancy, but always clean. Their English isn't the best either so if you don't know your basic Chinese just point at the number you want. All in all, service is friendly enough to make this a quick stop for a bite to eat. Just make sure you remember this place is CASH ONLY! If you forget, buy some gum at 99 Ranch Market and get cash back. (Been there done that).",

Nothing too special or fancy though we did have a question of if they were using the microwave to heat food up. We're still not sure!  The second time, I got the beef noodle soup (I think that's what it was called, it was the first one on the menu), got it spicy and with thick noodles! It was pretty good, the noodles were cooked just right (at least for me), it wasn't too spicy just enough to taste it, and the beef was very tender (it came apart very easily!). I believe it was $7.99 for that. My friend got the beef and tendon, spicy, and with thick noodles as well. I believe he liked it as well. Well it wasn't bad for either of us, so that's a plus.  It's worth a try, I still need to try some other items on the menu.",

I think they tried to season it primarily with cilantro. I've never seen so much cilantro in a bowl of beef noodle soup.. it was too much.",

I decided to try out this little restaurant because the ratings weren't too bad.  I learned from my Taiwanese/Chinese friend that no one makes beef stew noodle the same, so I always keep an open mind to the different recipes and flavors. However, I was not as impressed with the food here. The broth was a lot thicker and oilier than other restaurants that I have tried. The food came out extremely fast, and it tasted as though they had kept the same broth warm all day (it was salty). Also, the broth already comes spicy (I usually have to ask to add spice elsewhere). I wanted to try their thick/wide noodles, but they had ran out that day.  This rating is solely on food, even though I feel like the restaurant could improve a little bit on their service. There were no spoons at our table, so I had to look around and grab some myself from their counter. I'm not a big stickler for those kinds of things, but I know some might find it to be bad service. The people are sweet though!   Maybe next time I'll have to try another dish to understand why people rave about this place!",

But before I rate and compare their foods to other similar restaurants, I like to point out one thing that is VERY UNPLEASANT. IF YOU ARE NOT A MANDARIN SPEAKING CHINESE, YOU ARE GOING TO GET SECOND RATE SERVICE. AND, THE SERVICE OVERALL IS BELOW AVERAGE FOR RESTAURANTS LIKE THIS TO START WITH. Sad to see this. We spoke English to the waitress and was seated. At least 4 groups came in after us. They ALL spoke Mandarin and were handed manus and served tea quickly. We waited and waved at the waitress to get attention. She brought us the menu and then the tea. The waitress then proceeded to take orders and served the foods to the 4 groups came in after us. Again, I waved for the waitress and she came and took my orders. CAME IN FIRST AND SERVED 5TH, NOT RIGHT !  The foods are pretty standard Taiwanese food and can be compared to other similar restaurants easily, like China Mama, Taiwan Deli, or the now closed Taiwan Kitchen, just to name a few. The beef roll was greasy, the jar jong mien was tasteless, the spicy beef was tough, and the beef brisket noodle was bland. It only deserve 2 stars and no more. Their location is in the Chinatown Plaza so it is a tourists trap. Locals beware.",

This time, I finally got to try it!  Yaaayy!!!  Right off the plane (red eye flight), grougy, tired, and hungry, we had to kill time before picked up Aunty and Uncle and check into our hotel.  So we bought our buns from Diamond and waited till this place opened at 10am.    So we had the following:  Stewed Beef Soup Noodle - The beef noodle hit the spot!  Wow!  The taste is just so warm and satisfing.  The noodles are cooked just right - a little chewy and not over done.  Soup has flavor like I remember from Taiwan.  Also, has a little sour cabbage for  some BANG!  Beef Wrap - Almost like Peking Duck, but wrapped in a tortilla and uses beef instead.  It has the tortilla wrap, hoi sin sauce, egg, thin slices of beef, green onions, and chinese parsley.  We ordered this on the recommendations of yelpers.  Thought it was not bad, but nothing special.  Spicy Shrimp Won Tons - This was ok.  Imagine the shrimp won tons you get in won ton mein. Take out the noodles and the broth.  Put it on a bed of vegtables (bak choy) with oyster sauce and chilli sauce.  That's basically it.  Since I make won tons at home, this dish didn't raise my eyebrows.  Later in the trip, we came here again Aunty and Uncle.  We had to share our latest find, since last time in Vegas I took them to eat Taiwanese food, I failed.  If I failed this time, I would have to treat Uncle to our next trip to Vegas.  This time we ordered the following:  Stewed Beef Soup Noodle - A little spicier than last time, but since I can handle spicy, it was still really good!  Beef Wrap - Aunty and Uncle liked our leftovers when we picked them up after the first day, so we ordered it again.  Steamed Dumplings with Nappa Cabbage - I love dumplings!  Really good size, filling is really good!  Texture is not mushy, so yummy!  Put their homemade chilli sauce on the table, and tastes even better!  Steamed Shrimp Dumplings - I love more dumplings!  Inside has shrimp and chives, and other things that make it tase delicous!  Cooked to perfection.  Did I say I love dumplings?  So how did I do with Aunty and Uncle?  Let's say, that Uncle should pay for my trip back to Vegas!  Too bad I didn't make that bet with him!  I think they'll be back!",

Also they're portions are very generous and they really work to become an aspiring business. Even though they get busy, they serve you and get you so they can keep running. They don't wanna keep people waiting for their food. Sometimes when they aren't busy, you may see the owner just sitting there reading. As a boss he still helps and is really social. I love this place.",

After the cleared some tables the waiter/cashier ask who many people. I was seated right away. They brought me hot tea. I ordered the won ton red oil sauce and crispy chicken leg rice plate. The won tons came it was great. Then my entree came next that was delicious. It was basically  chicken, vegetables, eggs and rice. That filled me up! Also it's a big serving which I love! They never came and ask how the food taste or refill the drinks. Overall food was good but they can improve on the costumer service.",

    "text": "This review is based sole on their beef noodle soup. I'm comparing their beef noodle soup to Din Tai Fung's in Arcadia (which is the best beef noodle soup I've ever had, thus far).   So, I've been to this place totaling 4 times now. I can say that their consistency of the Beef Noodle soup is a little off each time. The very first time, I was in love with it and then lately, it's seems like there's at least something missing. Even so, I still enjoy going here for their chewy noodles. Their portions are fairly huge and cheap too.   Beef Noodle Soup: Soup tasted fine and the noodles are chewy but the beef was tough.  I give it a 3 1/2 star for the lack of consistency.  Service is a 4, the server girl is attentive and friendly.",

    "text": "This place is so tiny I almost forgot to yelp about it!  Yep, definitely a hole-in-the-wall, and a pretty good darn one at that!  I've only been here once while I was on my way to a performance, and I was a little skeptical.  The restaurants in Chinatown aren't the best, and there have been about three restaurants before this one in the same location.  But, Noodle Pot proved me wrong.  I only tried their beef noodle soup since it was recommended to me; it's a decent bowl of soup.  The portion is large for a really cheap price.  The beef is super tender.  They pretty much fall apart when you bite into it.  Also, the noodles are hand made.  Hand made noodles in Vegas?  I've never had hand made noodles, so I don't know what the standard is, but these noodles are wide and flat.  The edges are sort of splayed, so it looks like it was just pulled or something like that.  The edges are soft and when you bite, the experience is like eating al dente pasta.  It's a little crunchy in the middle.    The soup is standard beef noodle soup.  I like Champion's more because the base has a little more taste (salt) but the hand made noodles is probably the thing that's going to bring me back.  Make sure when you come here that you speak Mandarin/Taiwanese.  The place is owned by a couple that doesn't understand English, and the waitresses (who are their daughters, I think) speak a sort of broken English.  I definitely think it would've been easier for me to order if I spoke Mandarin, but the whole finger pointing works too.",

    "text": "Terrible service period, since we don't speak taiwanese people that showed up after us got seated before us. They got their food before us, the place is dirty. We waited at our table for over 10 minutes before ever being acknowledged (I'm pretty sure it would have been longer if we didn't go up to the cashier trying to order), the table we had to run and claim ourselves. The yelp location of the place is completely wrong so a couple of u turns had to happen. Waited forever for the food after waiting a lifetime to even put our order in. While waiting watching more people who arrived after us get their food.  The food is not worth going through all the crap.   And the check was wrong.",

    "text": "A friend and I stopped in here on a Monday night. There weren't many in, and we were seated quickly. Very friendly waitress! She took very good care of our order, and recommended the beef noodle soup. The soup was fantastic! The broth was flavorful and rich, and the beef, despite having some parts that were difficult to bite through, was very good. We ordered some dumplings as well, which the cook came to let us know that they were out of, so it was deducted from our check, but they gave us some other dumplings instead. It was unexpected and pleasant.  I was a bit surprised to see hot tea in plastic drinking tumblers, but it was still good, and I've seen it done in a few other restaurants. Use your common sense and don't just grab the cup immediately if you ordered hot tea!  Definitely a good place for an evening meal, and I want to go back and see what their other menu items taste like.",
