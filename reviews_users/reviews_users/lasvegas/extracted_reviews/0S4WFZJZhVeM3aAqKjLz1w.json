It's up on the 50th floor of the Rio and the decor was interesting fit their voodoo theme. Prices for a steak range from $46 for a flat iron steak to $88 for their top. I'd say to try it once if you don't mind spending the money.",

    "text": "Many years ago the Voo Doo Lounge was one of my parents favorite restaurants and they ate here every time they came to Vegas.  Since then several new hotels and restaurants have popped up and although the RIO is a nice hotel it's definitely now one of the older ones and so is this restaurant.  I was more than excited to try this place, I was with a few co workers and since we were staying at the RIO, it made sense to have dinner here this evening.  For drinks I enjoyed the sangria which was fabulous followed by a glass of red with dinner, I've heard the witches brew drink is amazing but I was with my boss and co worker so I didn't want to get too crazy :).  The food and the service unfortunately I wasn't impressed with.  I felt very rushed and I really like to sit back and dine for hours upon end at a nice restaurant like this.  I also thought it was extremely expensive, now I don't mind paying $40 for a salmon dish as long as it's truly mouth watering and the side of veggies isn't just 2 pieces of cauliflower.  The one thing I'm picky with is the temperature of food, I like my food piping hot, I don't know what it was this week but everything I had was just warm.  I ordered the salmon dish, the plate was cold so obviously the fish went cold quickly, I even heat my plates in the oven at my own house when I'm cooking myself a hot meal.  We also ordered a few sides including the mushrooms and asparagus which came out 10 minutes after our meal, it would have been nice to have our sides with our meals.  Again these weren't very hot either and by the time they got to me and onto my cold plate they were freezing.  My salmon was okay, nothing special compared to any other piece of salmon I've had, I enjoyed the mushrooms, the wine was good and I have to say the one thing I enjoyed the most was the cracker/pita bread thing that came out with the bread when we arrived.  We didn't have dessert and because we said no to dessert the next thing you know, plates are cleared and the bill is on the table and we were out the door.  One trick I've learned is to always accept a dessert menu as it saves you time from being so rushed out.  The view is gorgeous and the rooftop upstairs is beautiful and a great spot to have your a picture taken but overall I'm just not that impressed.  I think so many other amazing places have popped up since the hype of the VooDoo opened.  I'd go back if the prices were a bit lower, portions were a bit bigger and my food was piping hot!",

The plate they brought me for the complimentary bread was dirty. The plate they brought me for the appetizer was also dirty. I didn't really think our appetizer was that good (fried Brie) but my boyfriend said he loved it. Maybe I was just too preoccupied with the dirty plates.... I got a filet, I think it was 12 oz and my boyfriend got the dry aged bone in rib eye. Both of our steaks were undercooked. I had ordered medium and he ordered medwell. I am fine with a medium rare or even a rare steak... that's just not what I ordered tonight. But since I enjoy rare-medrare steaks just as much as medium ones I decided to eat it anyway. That steak practically melted in my mouth. It was sooooo good. I tried a bit of my boyfriends steak and was surprised at how different the flavor was. It was really good too. We also had a baked potato (kinda hard to screw that up) and the truffle Mac and cheese as our sides and they were both acceptable.   The food was good but the only thing that really wow'ed me was the steak, and for $200.... I expect everything about my experience to wow me. I especially expect all of my plates to be clean. That took my rating down a star. Not worth the money in my book",

The greeter downstairs was not over friendly but took our name and said go to 50th floor. We had questions about getting back into the lounge after the show. She had no idea the answers to how we do that. But in future you just get a stamp from the security when you come out.   Bus staff was more of an assistance than our actual waiter. We were greeted immediately by her and she poured waters and made she we all were settled.   Waiter can about 15 min after we sat and we ordered drinks and seafood platter. Which seafood platter is basically bar food appetizer with fried coconut shrimp4, crab cake 1, 4 frog legs and some shrimp. Not anything spectacular. We got our appetizer when our entrees were  coming out over 1 wait. When we asked for the appetizer first it was like we were asking for the world. We wanted to enjoy food.   Lamb loin honestly was worst lamb I have ever ate. Didn't taste like lamb it was like a sausage of some sort. Creamed spinach was good just slightly over cooked but all our food probably day under heat lamps to be honest because we waited hour for appetizer.   Other than our bus staff services was not all that great for expensive place. Just paying for the view and many of other great places",

The decor is in desperate need of updating, but the food makes up for that.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  He handled our large group well.  I started my meal with the VooDoo Style Wedge Salad.  It is a slightly different take on the wedge.  You get the standard wedge of iceberg covered in crispy cured lomo, bacon, and Maytag blue cheese.  The twist comes with the orange vinaigrette they top it with.  It is a solid salad.  The citrus makes it a little unique.  For my main course I ordered the 12 oz. filet mignon.  The filet was prepared exactly as ordered.  It was tender, juicy and flavorful.  They did a very good job seasoning it as well.  The black pepper gave it some bite.  We ordered a few sides for the table.  I tried the Confit Fried Fingerling Potatoes.  They were solid.  They may be a bit salty for some, but I was happy with them.  This is not a cheap meal by any means, but it is inline with most quality steakhouses in Las Vegas.  The views are worth the trip at least once even though it is off strip.  If you eat later you can head upstairs to the lounge after and get even better views.",

No sauce. My bf had the chicken. The taste was really good. He also got a side of whipped potatoes--best tasting item of the night. Pretty sad huh?! Waiter talked us into their homemade creme brulee, my favorite dessert. Again, bland. Not much vanilla flavor AND they used Cool Whip rather than real whipped cream! The ambiance is nice except for the table of ten drunk girls who were hooting and hollering all night. It was my bf's birthday and I wanted to take him somewhere nice with a nice ambiance. After all, when you spend $150 on dinner, part of what you're paying for is the experience, right? I really think the wait staff or management should have said something. Either that or put couples on one side and partying groups on another. Also when I made reservations, Open Table had asked if this was a special occasion. I said that it was a birthday dinner. No one said \"happy birthday\" or put a candle in our dessert or any kind of acknowledgement. Why do they ask if they aren't going to at least MENTION it!!??!!",

Our servers were very attentive without hovering, we got a bottle of wine, which they kept chilled at the bar for us. We got the lump crab & artichoke dip, which was delicious, and a very ample portion, so much so I opted for a salad and soup for dinner (pathetic I know while at a steak house, but the boyfriend let me try some of his steak). The wedge salad was pretty standard, good dressing, but had 2 pieces of almost whole bacon, not crumbled. The French onion soup was fabulous, cheese was nice and crispy on top, and a good amount of onions. The boyfriend got the Ribeye, perfectly cooked to medium, and nice grill marks and a juicy center. We will be back.",

Apart from the tower view, the aged flavorful cajun rib-eye -- probably the fattiest peice of meat I've ever had was the main reason to dine here.  It was so fatty that I had to cut out some of the thicker marbles which made up almost a fifth of my steak, but every bite was packed with that rich, meaty flavor which I love.   The sides appetizers and desserts were just standard fare.",

    "text": "The view was great, and the food was delicious, but the service was pretty much the worst I've ever received.  My husband and I are young and not big drinkers, so we're no strangers to having restaurants assume we won't tip well, but the staff at Voodoo really took that to a new height.  To start off, we had a 6:00 reservation and weren't seated until almost 6:30.  Wouldn't have been a big deal, except that three or four couples who arrived after we'd already been waiting for almost twenty minutes were all seated before we were.  Not sure what's up with that when they tell you that they can't hold your reservation for more than ten minutes.  Then our server, Christian, came over to introduce himself, and from the first words out of his mouth, he was brusque almost to the point of rudeness and, frankly, just seemed pissed off to be waiting on us.  I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, since it's the night before Thanksgiving--maybe he was bummed to be at work the night before a holiday--but I could hear him interacting with the tables around us, and he was friendly and talkative to them.  He sounded irritated every time he spoke to us, was flat-out rude when he came to bring us our check and get us a to-go box for the food we couldn't finish, and remained just as rude and impatient when we paid the check and gave him a good tip.  I loved their food, but being treated like I'm an inconvenience because someone assumes that being young and sober = being a shitty tipper kind of ruins the dining experience for me, especially when I'm eating at a fancy restaurant.  It would have been nice to be able to go out on a nice date with my husband without being treated like second-class citizens for being in our early twenties.",

The elevator up was the only scary part as it turns out, hostesses were super nice even though we were about 15 minutes late for our reservation.  Jamal was our server he was so wonderful  and attentive without being over bearing.  We started with some cocktails and the Steak Tartare and it was fantastic, then we had the Dry Aged Rib eye with Broccoli and the asparagus.  It was cooked perfectly to the way we ordered mine was medium rare and my boyfriends was medium! We didn't have more left over for desert so we decided to have another drink and take them outside on their amazing balcony and enjoy the views it was a warm night with a great breeze.  It was a wonderful dinner that much to my surprise ended with a proposal from my now Fiance! I will be back next time we are in town and I hope that we are treated as wonderfully as this time!  Thank you to Jamal for the wonderful service hopefully we will see you next time!",

Due to a food allergy, we informed our server that we needed our sides to be gluten free.  We inquired about the green beans with shallots and almonds and the lemon aioli asparagus as they seemed like they might be harmless.  He told us he didn't think there would be a problem with those sides, but would double check just to make sure.  He never came back, so we assumed it was fine.  When our food came out, we were served plain, dry, barely warmed up asparagus and green beans.  We asked what happened and he said the almonds in the green beans were brushed with flour and the aioli sauce had flour in it so he had them prepare it without.  While we appreciated that he was looking out for the allergy issue, we asked why didn't he come back and tell us this so we could decide on different sides that were gluten free as the main reason we wanted to try those sides were because of the flavors, not just to be given plain steamed vegetables at $11 each!  His response was to just turn and walk away, never to be seen again until he literally threw the check on our table.  We then called over a manager who comped the vegetables and offered us another glass of wine, which we declined.  We just wanted to be done at that point.",

And it's not necessarily where the beautiful people work or dine. BUT I had the best crab cake there, and the best Chilean Sea Bass. I thought the sweet sauce was going to ruin the CSB, but it was delicious and perfectly cooked and I couldn't stop eating it. Hubby got the menage a trois - the filet was awesome, the prawns were pedestrian and the lobster tail was okay. The view was great - we didn't make reservations so they put us in a booth away from the windows (which was fine), but the window seats had great views. All in all, it was good and I didn't walk away feeling disappointed like other pricey restaurants. Oh, the wine was good (I think it was a Pinot Grigio), but not the best.",

The bill came and $80 was charged for the water we had with our meal.  For our water. They were probably trying to find a way to get more money out of our group because we weren't drinking enough of their overpriced drinks. Who knew their water was going to be overpriced too. To top that off the filet was dry and the server was unable to answer questions about the menu.  If you are going to spend top dollar for a meal you have much higher expectations than this.",

    "text": "Very disappointed.  Only reason I didn't give Voodoo Steakhouse zero stars is because it has a nice view.  First I ordered a Heineken in a glass.  The glass was not frosty and the Heineken was so skunky that it tasted like it was in storage for months...couldn't drink it.  Then the bread came out.  Nice butter, but bread could cut glass.  No doubt the bread was sitting out all day (2days?).  I ordered the 10oz fillet mignon with demiglaze and asked for 'extra sauce on the side', medium-rare with the truffled macc and cheese, and broccoli with garlic and oil for my two sides.  Meal came out without any sauce on the side and barely any on the meat.  I asked for my side of sauce and they brought out an amount that still wasnt enough for the whole steak.....I gave up on the sauce. Meat was dry and overcooked which is a huge negative for a steakhouse.  The macc and cheese could have been from any mediocre buffet and the broccoli was practically raw.....way too crunchy and tough.    Now it's 2 hours after eating and I don't feel 100%.....a little stomach uneasiness.  I wanted to express my thoughts to the waiter but does that really do anything other than make me look like a jerk?  So I paid my almost $90 bill with a smile....but will not be going back.",

    "text": "Well lets start with the decor. In one word ugly, brown painted wall with a few wire voodoo figures, same old beat up chairs with stains on the fabric and wood that is all chewed up, I don't know who hired the designer , must have gone to home depot and asked for redecorating idea. There is nothing voodoo about it , the old decor was fun and different, this one is just different for the sake of not be the same but very badly done and done cheap. Then the setting, water stains on the silverware and bus boy that pour tap water into my glass with bottled water in it, I guess job training cost too much also. Then the food, well that is the tiniest and worse $48 fillet I have ever seen and the asparagus side dish was so tough and fibrous that only the first inch can be eaten, the rest would make a nice hammock cause it is tough enough to. My so call lobster thermidor was a total joke, I guess they decide what that is, no cognac in the sauce, no re bake in the shell with bread crumbs on top, and two tiny claw meat and the rest is crab!!!! This is the most pathetic Lobster Thermidor I have ever seen covered with a mystery salty sauce that have nothing to do with the dish other than to cover up the cheap ingredients. BTW in case they actually read this stuff at the RIO hotel, this is what Wikipedia's  definition of lobster is. Lobster Thermidor is a French dish consisting of a creamy mixture of cooked lobster meat, egg yolks, and cognac or brandy, stuffed into a lobster shell. It can also be served with an oven-browned cheese crust, typically Gruyere. The sauce must contain mustard.  Then after dinner got even worse, I left my cell phone there so I figure I call the restaurant to ask them to hold it for me. well the hotel computer only wanted to know if I want a room and when I got the operator, she send me to restaurant reservation , they send me back to operator and round and round it took all of 35 minutes...35 !!! then they tell me the restaurant is close and call security, security said call lost and found but they only open till 6 , on a Saturday in a casino they are open till 6!!!! I was more than disgusted with the entire system that have not the slightest notion of customer service in mind, they actually ask me to have my credit card ready when I was on hold for the operator.......this has turned into a low class , customer is just a walking credit card to them kind of a place. I will not be eating there, I will not be staying there and i most certainly will not be gambling there.",

Knowing this, I urged my friends to come with me here to celebrate my birthday this past weekend. As soon as we walked in, we were overlooked by the hostess and even the bartender when we sat down. Once we got seated, it took a good amount of time to actually be acknowledged. Once we finally were, the waiter was extremely short with the questions we had. It took a good amount of time for the food to be prepared which is fine because well cooked food takes time. However, our waiter did not check in on us once during this time. My friends and I did see him check in on other tables though and even make small talk with them and completely overlooked us. This being said, while the food was exceptional the service lacked the same so I will not be returning. There are many good steakhouses in Vegas with not only good food but good service. Very disappointed I wasted my time spending my birthday here.",

    "text": "Overall very disappointing experience.    Visited on Sunday, November 11th, 2018.  We had reservations at a different restaurant in Chinatown.  However, traffic was a mess because of marathon.  So by time we got to the area of the Rio, we just decided to stay and check out Voodoo.  No issues getting right in without a reservation.   We sat down about 7pm.    At 7:15pm, the waiter finally came by.   Had to ask for the wine menu.  Then asked for the cocktail menu.  Finally got drinks and dinner ordered about 7:20.  Salad and oysters came out in 10 min.  No issues.  Not great, but no issues.  That was it for the next 35 minutes.  The waiter didn't come by once to give us an update or apologize.  At 8:05, I finally found our waiter and asked if the food was coming anytime soon.  He said \"sorry, let me get the manager\".  10 minutes later the manager still had not showed up, so I found another waitress and she got the manager right away.  He said the kitchen was backed up, which didn't make sense as we saw other people getting their food.  I explained our waiter had not been by, but we watched another waitress working very hard.  We were going to just pay for our salad, apps and drinks and take off, since we had a show to get to.    At that time, the food finally showed up.   About 50 minutes after our order.  The manager said he would pay for the steaks and apologized.  I was going to just dismiss our experience as a single bad waiter.  But then we tried the food.   My $58 Ribeye was dry and lacked any flavor. My wife's $48 flat iron steak was like rubber and inedible. Our side of mac-n-cheese was disgusting.  So glad we didn't have to pay for this meal and waste of 90 minutes.  You can get better steak at Texas Roadhouse.",

    "text": "We had an early 6:45 reservation. Despite many trips to Vegas I had never heard of this steakhouse.  The view is amazing and what distinguishes it from others if the ability to be outside in their rooftop at the 57th floor with almost a 360 view. It was also great to be there during daylight hours, through sunset and into evening.  My GF Ordered the foie gras and said it was perfect. The plate was beautifully presented. We split an order of the Voodoo Menage a Trois which was 6 oz of fillet mignon, 2 large grilled shrimp, a lobster tail, asparagus, and mashed potatoes.  Everything was cooked perfectly and the kitchen split the plate for us, all of which was presented lovely.  Our waiter, Jacinto, was one of the best I've had in Vegas.  And at less than $100, I thought this was a good value for Vegas.",

The most delicious lamb and couscous dish hands down, appetizers and drinks to die for and dessert menu is very fun and beautiful to look at. I can tell whoever is in the kitchen really enjoys food which I appreciate because I do too.  Service is meh. Very relaxed maybe even borderline unprofessional but you can't expect great service from a union establishment. Restaurant decor is dated but I'm not that shallow. I'm there for the food. When I went there there, almost everything I wanted from the wine list they didn't have. But a lovely view to have when you do end up getting a drink. I would consider this a hidden gem in Las Vegas.",

For dinner we started off with the short rib bruschetta and we were very happy. Hubby went on to have the prime rib while I had the Jidori Free Range Chicken- we were not disappointed. He prime rib was a True medium and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. As for the sides, we had the lobster mac n cheese, and tempura green beens. I'm not a fan of mac n cheese, but my hubby is and he liked it. The green beans were good by themselves, we didn't care for the cream sauce that goes with it.  They are very generous with their delicious drinks, which is nice concidering the prices are a bit on the higher end. I had the Euphoria and he had the Red October- which isn't red but pinkish. They were both good though.  The view from the top is gorgeous. Depending on which side you're seated on, you either see South Vegas or North Vegas, neither is a bad view. When taking pictures, it's best to go to the patio as the windows have a lot of glare.   The staff was very friendly. The manager went to every table, introduced himself, and congratulated each with their special occasion (birthday, anniversary). It was a nice and warming experience.   We will surely be back to try something new.",

He surprised the boys with their signature witch doctor drink, virgin of course!! Was super cool! Food is amazing and so is the view. We had the coconut shrimp, fried Brie, spinach and watercress salad for appetizer. For entree we had their steak and sea bass which was AMAZING. My husband loves sea bass and thought this was one of the best sea bass in Las Vegas. They have good vegetarian options too. Wine list is very good and reasonably priced. If you chose to bring your own wine, corkage fee is $35. Their chocolate bomb cake was the absolute best! The staff is amazing and very friendly. We avoid strip restaurants for special occasions but voodoo steak goes above and beyond for special occasions, special thanks to Samuel. Would highly recommend.",

We were fortunate to have Samuel and Nasto serve us.  They are great - ask for them!  Sam makes each experience special and meaningful.  We first had Sam serve us two years ago.  It is great he is still there; we appreciate his attention to detail and polite, professional - yet personal mannerisms.)    We've not had a bad meal yet - and we enjoy visiting fine dining establishments all across the country.  After each meal, we enjoy a few glasses of wine out on the rooftop patio.  On a nice evening, it doesn't get much more relaxing!  Unfortunately, our last visit was on the awful night of October 1, 2017.  As the horror rang out just blocks away, we were finishing our dessert and were headed to the rooftop patio with our drinks.  The staff were amazing by informing us of what was happening (apparently someone had a police scanner there - very helpful and highly recommended).  We eventually had to be evacuated from the roof for security concerns.  The staff could not have been more kind, courteous and concerned for our safety.  Thank you to everyone.  Our thoughts and prayers remain with that city and its people!",

For a typical steakhouse charging $50+ for their steaks this place is by far on the bottom end of what you would expect.  Food by was decent but not worth the price.  Reason for the 2 stars is this place had the absolute slowest service I've ever experienced.  In the 2 hours we were there server was only able to come around twice to get drink orders.  Secondly,  it took over 30 minutes for them to cash us out.    The only redeeming quality of this place is the view of the Vegas skyline which is pretty nice.   Other than that there are plenty of other options that I would choose from before going here again.",

We were seated on the strip side of the restaurant, and could see the entire Las Vegas strip lit up and sparkling. Our waiter, Jamal, was attentive, kind, and professional, making the entire experience magical. I had the diver scallops, and my husband had the filet. The scallops were excellent, and the filet was exceptional - buttery tender with great flavor. We shared the Voodoo truffle fries, which were also amazing. We each had a martini, and then I asked for a glass of wine with dinner - it appeared the second the food was delivered, again like magic.   While not cheap, this was definitely an experience worth every penny. If we're in Vegas again, we'll be back.",

Steak was proper but I couldn't even finish the sides even though they were tiny servings. I'll be back to try again because I have several friends that like this place so I'll update later. Enjoy",

There was literally what looked like a gurney for moving people around and weird \"voodoo\" like decorations on the walls. We got in the elevator of horrors, which was not air conditioned. The view outside was great, but not at 140 F.   When we got into the restaurant, there was a weird lion/leopard/Africa them to the chairs, but a decidedly French/American menu. We had a nice view.  Our server forgot my order of truffle mac and cheese and there weren't really truffles in it (they faked out on me when they finally brought it). My lobster bisque had a skin on it by the time it came out, my sidecar was average.  One saving grace was the basket of bread brought out. It had the parmesan flat crisps and they were quite good.   We were also charged for water. Tap water.  If you want a view, hit this up at night for the club. It seems better suited to that than as a restaurant.",

The view from on top was amazing, and allowed for access to the outside deck and photo ops at The Zipline. The braised veal cheek appetizer was phenomenal, and the perfect lead to what was one of the best 12 oz. filet mignon steaks I've ever had. My wife's lobster was spot on, and served with a drawn butter which could undoubtedly be described as glorious. Every dish was cooked to perfect medium/med-rare, flawlessly seasoned, and paired brilliantly with complimentary accoutrement. A side of the intoxicating truffle mac 'n cheese was the perfect (and only) way to complete what was for us a fantastic dining experience.  Our dinner plans for future Lost Wages trips have instantly been compromised, as Voodoo was one for the memories.",

I had to get the waiter's attention as he did not give us any steak knives either.  Although we got seated immediately for our 6:30pm reservation at a wonderful table with a spectacular view overlooking Vegas, we immediately notice that the restaurant did not have any A/C on.  Our waiter did not even inform us about it.  We looked around and notice fans situated at different areas of the restaurant.  Because there was only 2 of us in our party, we were not privvy to get a fan at all.  With the hot halogen lights shining on us, it got even hotter and uncomfortable.  The table next to us also complained.  To top it off, their waiter forgot about their side dishes.

We started with the Witch Doctor Sampler which we inhaled....my favorite was the zucchini beignets.    We had the sea bass, braised veal, pork chop, and the bone-in ribeye.  We had no complaints...they were all equally delicious.  We had the dessert trio and a chocolate mousse cake for dessert.  They were fantastic too.  The only complaint we had was that we were not informed beforehand that we were limited to 2 hours for our dinner, and that we could get discounted prices on our dinner by presenting the rewards card for the Rio.  I think they should inform patrons when reservations are being made so that we're aware.  Other than that, we had a great time...fireworks or not.",

Seating: Upon arrival they told us no tables were available but had booths. No problem since we didn't have a reservation. Once we entered though there were over half the table's empty.   Service This is one of the stars in my review. The service was exactly what you would expect. Very knowledgeable about the menu and made sure we had everything we needed.   Food Appetizers were good. We had wedge salad and lobster bisque. Other people in the party agreed that they were well thought out on presentation and taste. Main courses were steak, chicken and salmon. All three were over cooked with almost no flavor. The crackers on the table had more taste and didn't cost $50.00 a plate. View This was the reason for the other star. It was perfect and they have an outdoor balcony that looks over the Las Vegas skyline.  Great for pictures and a little romance!  For $300 plus meal this was a very bad experience. Any of the casino hotels have better food at their buffet and it will save you some cash for the casino's.",

We bought a voucher at the 1/2 price tickets booth that gave us 25% OFF the entire dinner incl drinks.  Our reservation was for 7p and we were seated promptly at that time. We got the prized table by the window as well. Too bad a storm rolled through the night before, the windows needed washing.  When we called  to make a reservation we were told the attire was \"smart casual\". I guess that means, in America, anything goes but \"wife beaters\" and swimsuits. I couldn't believe the liberties other diners took in the  dress department. I'm not faulting the restaurant, that's just the way it is these days.  Anyway, we started off with the Witch Doctor Sampler, included were rock shrimp, mini beignets, coconut shrimp and a lone crab Cake. The portion was just right for two to share. The quality of the shrimp was decent, cooked just right but nothing about the sampler stood out, the dish was served surprisingly cool.  My Scallops, on the other hand, were perfectly cooked, tender and succulent! Yum factor quite high. My cousins 8oz Filet was a real treat as well, ordered med rare (as it should be ordered) came out just perfect. She almost didn't need  a knife to cut it.  We ordered the side of Ragout of mushrooms, fingerling potatoes, asparagus and bacon. Another good call!  All in all, we were quite satisfied with the service as well as the meal, and blown away by the view. (Only with this was a revolving restaurant).  We saved $45.00 by using the voucher and that also got us into the Voodoo Lounge upstairs for free. You have to wander upstairs even if its just for a few minutes to take in the rooftop view.  Next time I would love to sample the buffet, I've heard it is also very good.",

    "text": "I was lucky enough to go to the voodoo steak twice on this trip to Vegas.  First was mothers day.  Although there was a special menu, we picked our favorite items off both menus.  We had crab cake.  These are the best of the best.  No filler. Only 100% crab meat with light crumbs to fry them lightly.  WOW. These are the real deal.  I had the black cod.  It you can't get to Nobu, the cod at the voodoo lounge's just as good and probably even better.  The rib eye was perfection.  Perfection--perfection temp, perfect seasoning and tender as you would hope for.  Then came the presentation of  the bananas foster..  The rum and carmel sauce when lit on  fire and poured over the bananas and rum raisin ice cream was so impressive.  If you have the change To eat at the voodoo steak,  grab it. You won't be sorry.",

It was Actually half empty and the service was average at best. The food is good, naturally a bit over priced. The service is average. The ambience is GREAT and benefits from the after dinner access to the rooftop nightclub. Great way to end the evening. So despite average service and good but overpriced food, when in Vegas we come here for the dinner views and apres-meal rooftop experience.",

They even split our meals, we had ordered 2 of the filet, lobster and shrimp dinners and the portions and presentation was awesome ( served 4 of us ) we also had the oysters the best I have ever had so fresh!  We had bone in ribeye it had to be  over a pound, huge and excellent grill flavor and very tender. We also had a chicken pasta dish which we all loved. We added mushrooms for the table again very good. We started with a cocktail on the outside deck over looking the city awesome views!  We were party of 6 so tip was added at 18% automatically, well worth it we added a bit to it, the service was that good! It is a tad pricey but the food quality and the service was excellent would highly recommend for a special event !",

I'm not sure where their previous experiences at fine dining steakhouses were based. This is not an Outback or Texas Roadhouse. Upon opening the menu, the price point was exactly what I expected. When I made my reservation, I requested a table by the window, which was honored.  We started out with the oysters. I personally do not eat oysters, but the other three people in my party do and they were so impressed that they ordered a second dozen. I ordered a crab cake and it was wonderful. It had a crispy breading around it and inside was wonderful shredded crab meat. Delish! I will say that we brought two bottles of wine from our wine collection at home and the corkage fee was an extremely reasonable $25.  For the entree, we all ordered the Land and Sea Menage a trois.  Filet mignon, lobster tail and grilled shrimp. Amazing. We all cleaned our plates and also had a side of creamed spinach that made the \"non creamed spinach eater\" eat his words.  We ended our meal with the chocolate cake and carrot cake. I was skeptical of the carrot cake because it contains walnuts and pecans and I do not care for them, but they were almost undetectable and the cake was perfection.  Voodoo is such a wonderful experience with the best view in the city. It's a shame more people don't have better things to say. Until next time...",

We ate at Voodoo after the Rat Pack show, so we just ordered appetizers for our meal.  Started with the Steak Tartare -- good, but a bit too much truffle oil.  Braised short ribs were great.  Foie gras plate was well done.  Decent wine selection, a bit cheaper than Prime or Delmonicos, with some nice mid-price bottles.  Waiter wasn't particularly knowledgeable about the wine selections and didn't offer to send over a wine steward or sommelier.  We knew what we were looking for & selected for ourselves; but if we would have needed help, we would have been stranded.  Probably won't go back, but we don't go to The Rio.

    "text": "Let me preface this with the following; I am from Calgary Alberta. We know a bit about beef in Alberta. My butcher in Calgary hangs meat for 14 days then wet ages it for a further 14. I then buy an entire Canadian Prime strip loin and they hang it for an additional 14 days for me. This is perhaps the best beef on earth. We do not have corn fed beef, we have grass fed, barley finished beef that is amazing in quality. The fat is white and these steaks are marbled almost to a Wagyu standard.    I know how to cook a steak. I lightly season the beef and then sous vide cook it for at least 2 hours at 130 F. I then sit the beef for 20 minutes and finish it a cast iron pan that is nearly glowing with heat. These are fork tender steaks of the most astonishing flavour.   I have eaten beef all over the world and honestly think this is the best. That said, I acknowledge that U.S.D.A. Prime is also awesome beef.  The steaks at Voodoo don't come close to this quality.  While the room is nice, the view great, and the ambience very good, the kitchen and service are nowhere near where they should be for this level of expense.  And expensive its is. Four of us racked up a 600 buck tab with a fairly good wine selection. We did not order the standard issue 'American' giant slabs of meat, just nice 8 or 10 oz fillets. We had Lobster Bisque and a Caesar Salad for starters.  The Salad was pedestrian at best. The Bisque however was truly great.   Of the four steaks two were very over cooked, one was very undercooked and one was missing a topping. Zero for Four is not a great way to start a meal.  After refiring the meat and sorting out the topping the cook was fine. The meat, less so. Two of the steaks were dry at medium. The rare steak was bland and the medium rare was mushy.  I was amazed that a place billing itself as a steak house could be so incompetent and cooking steaks. The joint wasn't all that busy, the service was uninformative and lax. The kitchen is a bit clueless.  The wine list is unimpressive and overly expensive. Almost zero good Bordeaux to be had.  I will not return, nor would I ever recommend Voodoo to anyone else.",

    "text": "Her Majesty and I had tickets to see Penn and Teller so we decided that the easiest thing to do would be to find a nice restaurant in the Rio to eat at before the show.  After looking through their website, we selected the Voodoo steakhouse and made reservations.  Ambiance Mixed bag here.  The restaurant is reasonably nice and the view from the 52nd floor is outstanding.   The only real negative I have is that the restaurant's website clearly states that they have a dress code but the restaurant seems to make no effort to enforce it.  Seated next to us was a group with backwards baseball caps on and next to them were 4 guys in shorts and t-shirts.  I realize that I am old and so stuff like this probably matters more to me than to most people but my feeling is that if you are going to advertise a dress code then people will use that information to help make their decision whether or not to go there.  If you have no intention of enforcing it, then that seems like False advertising to me.  Food We started with crab cakes that were dry and burnt to the point that The Empress did not want them.  We then moved to bisque for me and a salad for her, both of which were average.  The main course was lobster thermidor for me and sea bass for Milady.  She said hers was just okay but I was really disappointed in mine.  There was no thermidor sauce that I could find and it was really bland.  Dessert was also pretty average.  Definitely not the quality of food you would associate with the kind of place they are trying to be.  Service Bad.  We perpetually could not get drink refills because our waiter would disappear for long stretches.  Even then, simple things like offering The Empress some pepper to take away some of the blandness of her salad were overlooked even though he did it for the table right next to ours.  Overall As you can see from this review, we were pretty unimpressed with the place.  One thing I will add is that I thought it was very low value.  We each had only one drink (because we could not get anyone to get us another one) and still ended up spending almost $200.  There are too many good restaurants in Vegas to waste time on this place.",

    "text": "I should have known better that when I walked in on a Saturday night the place was dead, except for a table of 8 with a loud mouth at the helm making sure  the entire restaurant heard his conversations.  Let's start off and say the place is overpriced, and has sub par food. Service was OK, had to return a portion of my wife's steak as it was bland and did not taste right. The waiter was clearly trying to do his job by apologizing and offer a replacement dish, but the damage was done and killed her appetite.  The only savior of the night was a  good bottle of wine along with my wife by my side. Also the view of the strip was very nice.  Save your money as there are better places to eat steak in Vegas. Being a betting man, I would bet this place will not be around too much longer.",

    "text": "My husband and I had dinner on March 15th.  The view is great.  We arrived early for our reservation and were seated immediately.    The service had a lot to be desired.  I ordered a glass of zinfandel from the wine list.  The server made a point to (rudely) make we aware I was ordering RED zinfandel.  I'm 42 and was dressed appropriately for a nice dinner, so am not sure why he felt the need to let me know my $20 glass of wine was red -- not pink.   The fact that he thought that I he apparently thought I looked like I should be ordering pink zinfandel was insulting.    My husband asked if they served any mocktails and the waiter gave us a completely blank look, even after we explained what those were.  At the restaurant we went to the prior night, the waiter had an entire list of mocktails available.    When I ordered a 2nd glass of wine, I asked for the house cabernet.  The server corrected me -- saying they don't have \"house\" wines.  I clarified that I wanted the featured wine that is on the front page of the wine menu.  In my experience the \"featured\" wines by the glass are generally considered house wines.    In other server notes, our water glasses were never refilled, my empty wine glass (1st glass) was never removed, and our dinner was delivered before we were done with our appetizer.    The food was very good.  My husband had the trio and I had the scallops.  Both were great.  While the food was very good, the poor service makes this a restaurant I'd not recommend again.  There are plenty of other upscale steak restaurants in Vegas with great food and better service.",

I was super on the fence about it because the reviews were really mixed, but we needed to be conveniently located to the show for when doors opened.   The view alone is worth dining here, as it was really nice to see the city while eating.  But the bar had a lot more people at it, which doesn't enjoy the views that the dining area does.  They also have a patio you can enjoy your drinks on.  I enjoyed a glass of Prosecco and the complimentary bread that came out.  I ordered the Sea Bass or something, I honestly don't know but everything was tasty.  Hubby's steak was good, too.    Don't like that this is in the Rio, as that to me is a dive, but it was worth it for the convenience of the show.",

Today 3 days before New Year's I get an email from voodoo saying they're refunding my money claiming they had the wrong amount posted on their website .....bumping up the price $80 extra per person!!! As a business if you make a mistake it's your responsibility to correct it!  They're many ways to make a customer happy but you choose for me to cancel my New Year's dinner instead..shame on you for canceling days before New Year's Eve and not give me any options or say so.. bumming up the price $160 it's just a scam to get more money and it makes you look really bad !! This was supposed to be my first time visiting your restaurant and I will never consider visiting it now! You ruined my New Year's Eve plans!",

Made reservations a week in advance and was seated fairly quickly when our group arrived. I noticed it was pretty dark in here but I guess that's the atmosphere they're going for.   Selection was decent. I didn't do family style with others because I knew there would be at least half meat choices so I ordered a crab cake to eat alone, something light before a night at XS. Lol.   While we waited for our food, we went outside to the rooftop lounge and took pictures for quite some while. I came back to the table twice to check the food but it wasn't out yet. I guess the servers were waiting for our party to return to serve our food so that it was nice and hot.   My crab cake was okay but I wished I ordered a second dish or a side dish to eat but the side dish was too large of a portion for just 1 person (it says it serves up to 4)!   I don't remember how much my meal came out to but I agree to the 3 stars rating. Probably won't be returning because it isn't anything spectacular, just average.",

BUT.... the aged 20oz Steaks were tough and totally bland! We had better Steaks at the Black Bear Diner for much much less! The Servers think they are doing you a favor and it seems like they all think what a sucker of a customer is coming in! The side dishes had no flavor! 2 Stars for the View and the Deco...but really? 400 Dollar for a lousy Steak Dinner with a Bottle of Wine incl. Tip??? Don't waist your time and money, this Place needs Chef Robert Irvine for a Restaurant Rescue and the present Chef needs to go or chance his talents! I make better Steaks than that at home on my BBQ Grill! The reason we go to a \"out of the ordinary Steak House\" is to experience something great and something you can't do at home!  What a waist of Time and Money! Sad Sad Sad !",

    "text": "Went with my husband and daughter and overall, had a good time. The view is spectacular. The food: it was good not excellent. I have had better steaks in other places. Ordered a rib eye medium, it came medium well. This surprised me since places that sell steaks at $50+ usually cook them perfectly (you know, they are expensive). Anyway, told the waiter and he tried to insist that the steak was medium - excuse me sir, I KNOW the difference between medium and medium well. If I'm paying almost $100 for a meal, I also expect, at least, good service and attention. He hesitantly took the steak and went to the kitchen. They brought another rib eye and this time it was cooked perfectly (medium rare they said). I didn't like the mashed potatoes, lacked flavor and seemed too starchy. The salad, meh....not good. One good thing, the cheesecake, it was delicious. The price, this place is expensive, really expensive. More expensive than Morton's and other good steakhouses in Vegas. Will we return? Nah, don't think so. The view is spectacular and you can enjoy it from their lounge which doesn't require you to attend the restaurant.",

But, we were told that to sit at a window, we would have to each spend a minimum of $100. [This really isn't hard to do with their inflated prices--we actually spent a bit over $400 for the four of us.] What disturbed me was that everyone dining there could have been seated at a window table but instead they insisted on this antiquated and insulting practice. The food was adequate, nothing more. You have to read the menu with the server's flashlight which was also annoying. All in all, one star is more than adequate.",

    "text": "This was the most pricey restaurant I've been to so far and I'm sure that's due to the location (beautiful view overlooking Vegas) and the quality of food. I went with a group of 6 other people in celebration of a friend's birthday, and we each shared a taste of what we ordered. Everything was delicious and cooked well. My favorite was the lobster bisque because the flavor was perfect. Now that I've explained what I enjoyed, it's time for the bad news. The service was the absolute WORST I have yet to experience at any restaurant. It was a Tuesday night and it wasn't busy at all so one would think it wouldn't take too long just to get our order in, but it literally took 20 minutes just to order our drinks. Then another 30 minutes to get those drinks and order our food. Then it took about another 50 minutes to get our food. On top of the ridiculous wait times, I would put money on our waiter being stoned. Whenever he came around the table it was just to talk to us about the same thing each time, which was his friend who is from the same place as us. When we finished our food, and made it obvious we were ready for the checks, it still took another 20 minutes to go through the process. My friend used her card and the waiter said it wasn't working and didn't suggest any alternatives or anything. My friend had to go to the nearest ATM and withdraw cash which charged a 12 dollar fee so she could pay in cash. The card was obviously working and it was just a big inconvenience the waiter put her through. We had made plans for later in the night and those plans were cancelled due to the horribly long service. Overall, I would not eat there ever again. With the prices being what they were, I was expecting a lot more than what we received.",

    "text": "Short Version:  Atmosphere is great along the view of the strip from the 50th floor.  Our waiter, John, was extremely nice and attentive. Food was excellent.  Star entree of the evening was the dry aged rib eye steak cooked medium.  Nice redness to it, buttery texture, and VERY flavorful.  I also liked the Chilean sea bass, with its soft texture as well.  Filet Mignon was good, but just not great.  Lobster tails were cooked nicely.  I would recommend the lobster bisque as well.  Extended version: Rio's automated reservation system was frustrating.  After trying multiples times to get through, we figured no one would man the phone until 5 when they open.  We called back and asked for a Saturday 6:30 pm reservation for 6 plus a baby (kids definitely allowed, so that's a plus) but were told only 6 pm was available, so we took it.  The dumb thing was that at no time was the restaurant more than half full, even by the time we left.  And two of the big tables next to us remained empty the entire time.  You get to see the view from the elevator ride up.  There's only three available stops: ground floor casino, 50th floor restaurant/zip line, and 51st Voodoo Lounge.  You can go on to the balcony while waiting for your food to look at people riding the zipline (purchase your tickets before coming up) and the beautiful view of the strip.  You still have a good view from your seats though.   The wine by the glass selection for a steakhouse wasn't good at all.  I counted three cabs total available, one of which was Kendall Jackson.  That's the one thing I don't like about Vegas restaurants.  It's not about what wine goes good with your menu, it's more about who's giving you the best deal.  I would've loved to order a bottle of Honig cab for $86, but there was only one other casual wine drinker.  I ended up with a glass of Stags' Leap Petite Sirah for $17, which paired well with steak.  I wish there were some better cabs available by the glass. For starters, we had the cocktail shrimp (it was good, not easy to mess up simple shrimp), artichoke dip (also good), and coconut sugar cane shrimp (I forget the name of the sauce it came with, but it was excellent).  There were no entrees really for a kid, so we ordered a bunch of sides to split: French fries (minus the Cajun), Mac & Cheese (hold the truffle, oh well), asparagus (good), and potato puree (hard to mess up mashed potatoes).    The dessert menu was a little disappointing.  We saw online before we got there that they served a dessert fondue and chocolate lava cake.  But they recently pared their dessert menu down to five things and ice cream.  We ended up getting cheesecake (definitely below average) and bananas foster (presentation was better than it tasted).   One drink ($4-20), one starter ($15), one side ($8), one entree ($40-$76, ribeye is $46), one dessert ($10) will set the average person back about $100 before tax and tip. I'm taking off one star (and a half?) for the wine list and desserts.   Here's a tip:  Sign up for a player's card in the casino.  Rio (part of Harrah's) offers $1 or $2 off most menu items in all/almost all of their restaurants for members.",

The disappointing part of our meal were the steaks. They arrived on a big white plate with a couple Brussel  sprouts.  My small filet looked lost. No bother, I was hungry. The steak ordered med. rare was overcooked and absolutely tasteless. It was not charred, or juicy.  Just a bland, no color, no taste steak. I was really disappointed, and when we got  the check for just over $300, I decided they needed A review on yelp. We usually eat at the All American downstairs in the Rio, and will go there from now on. They have great steaks!  The Voodoo has the view of Las Vegas, and the atmosphere we all want, but I give them only one star for the steak. The waiter on the other hand, was five star excellent. Try the steak house downstairs.",

It wasn't bad, it just didn't taste amazing either. Some of the lobster pieces were overcooked and rubbery feeling. The pasta itself had little to no flavor... Again, my mistake for ordering seafood at a steakhouse.  The view though --- gorgeous panoramic views of the strip. They have a patio area that you can go out to and just enjoy the view, take some pictures, and hang out with your drinks. That was probably the best part about dining here.   Our server was also great and very friendly. He was quick to get us the things we needed and to correct any mistakes. He brought out the wrong side dish for my friend, and quickly remedied the problem (and let us keep the extra dish at no charge). The filet mignon that my friends ordered were yummy from what I could tell, and they were super satisfied with their meal.",

Our waiter was very attentive and the staff was friendly. The atmosphere in that restaurant is fabulous! We had 3 different kinds of steak and I had the top sirloin and my husband had the rib eye! All was cooked to perfection! We had the side of Mac and cheese and that was very good as well! Check this place out because overall, the food and the view from atop is spectacular! Will definitely be back again!",

Sadly that is where the selling point of this restaurant begins and ends.  I will make this short and sweet.  I understand we technically got there when the restaurant was closing but they still decided to seat us even though they initially turned us away but since we were a large party I guess they saw dollar signs.   Our server seemed annoyed by our presence and barely checked on us during the meal. For the prices of the meal I expect to receive 5 star service and it was more like 1 star. I've had better service at Chilli's. All the food i ordered was just ok nothing out of this world and definitely does not match the prices that go with it.  Please be aware that if you dine here you are basically paying for the view above anything else. The upside there is a rooftop lounge above the restaurant, which seemed to be playing pretty good music.",

The prefix menu was good and we enjoyed \"The Spell\" dessert though the presentation would work better with a short story to ramp it up. The price point of the restaurant is high so it was surprising that, separate from the view, the place has zero ambience to entertain Voodoo in its title. They need a total make over. \"Antique\" might be there decor design but it looks flat and uninspired. It's Las Vegas right?! Also ordered the signature drink that comes in a smoked box. That was a fun idea but the drink was undrinkable. From look to taste it was bad. Again, push Voodoo! Color and taste should be off the chart. Following dinner, we went up to the nightclub. It was early so the place was quiet but what a dive. The staff up there was off putting in attitude so we passed up the opportunity to buy a bottle of tequila for $400 and pour it ourselves. This place could be amazing and the food was good but all the other pieces here are missing. Can't really recommend it. They need an overhaul on several levels.",

    "text": "Awful.... Not classy at all. First off, you are not greeted in a professional manner. No, instead they automatically assume you are going to the club on the 51st, level even after checking on your reservation.   You then have to take an elevator. Where another hostesses asked if you have a reservation. I'm confused did the hostess downstairs not just call?  Then we were told to wait, so we did....... plenty of open tables, plenty!  We were then ushered to our table underneath a fluorescent flood light. Where the rest of the restaurant is dim like the nature of a steakhouse. I did asked to be moved to a not so spotlighted table. We were given menus and told our server would be with us shortly. Now, at this point and time it has already been 30mins since we arrived.  Our table attendant came over and asked if we would be drinking wine, I replied I do not know yet. Which at that time he then sighed, and removed all the stem wear from the table. So no I guess the answer is..no we will not have wine. And poured us water, then hastily left.  During this whole time our new table was by 7 boys, yes boys not men. 7 boys in shorts t-shirts and baseball caps. All loud, and eating with no home training  Our server finally made his way to our table. We both placed orders to start with the steakhouse French onion soup, and we would order after looking at the menu some more. He came back not 2 mins later. \"So what else will you be eating\". I replied, that we were still deciding.   During our soup wait our server was so I'm patient and impolite that he kept bombarding into the back of my chair like a bull.   Finally 1 hour after our reservation started we finally get soup. Burnt over salted, tasted like from a can. French onion soup. I refused to eat mine and sent it back. My husband starved at this time ate his.   I wanted nothing more than to go!!!!  Asked our server for our check, my soup was still on it....  We have enjoyed many steakhouses from coast to coast.   I really hope this is not their standard.",

Classic French Onion Soup was exactly that, with a thick cover of melted cheese and well-caramelized onions.  Initially our server mistakenly brought Coconut Shrimp to our table instead of the Shrimp Cocktail we ordered.  But when the switch was made, the Shrimp Cocktail was excellent, with large shrimps resting on a bed of lettuce.  A Caesar Salad was peppery but good.  Appetizer, soup, and salad all came together, but we had enough time to eat all the preliminaries before our entrees arrived.  My entree of an 8 oz. Fillet Mignon with Red Wine Sauce was medium rare as ordered, and very tender.  Additional requested Bearnaise Sauce was not listed on the menu, but was cheerfully supplied, and very good.  The large Baked Potato accompanying the steak was properly prepared but did not contain enough chives to my liking, so the manager brought me more.  Sauteed Wild Mushrooms further enhanced our enjoyment of the meals set before us.  It was somewhat noisy near the top of the Rio's Masquerade Tower, from conversations at adjoining tables.  But our excellent view of the Strip far below easily compensated for this.  And, a delicious slice of creamy, old-fashioned New York-style Voodoo Cheesecake served with fresh berries topped off a fine meal.  A bountiful assemblage of fresh blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries was strategically placed on top of and wedged around the generous portion of Cheesecake.  4-1/2 stars on this lovely night!",

That's what we got. Not going to elaborate too much bc there's really not much to tell.  Everything is OOOOKKKKK!  Ooooookkkkkk with a price tag that should be beeeeeetttttteeeeerrrr.  Steaks and seafood were all on the dry side.   Check out my photos.  Food looks much better than it taste. Presentation was fab but I rather get something that looks like shizzz but tastes great. Just sayin...  Right outside the rooftop, they got that skyline zip thing. Handful in the group went. Think it was $30 a head. Two in a seat and you get zipped back and forth. The whole actual zip time was about a minute.  An experience.   Final thought... If you are stuck here, this is probably the best restarant in the hotel.  Came out to about $120/per.  Personally, I rather go elsewhere paying the same for better food. Dahhhh!",

We started with the steak tar tar which was quite delicious along with the crab cake which sat in a tartar sauce and was also delicious with a great crunch on the outside. I got the filet medium rare and it came out perfect. He got the dry aged ribeye, but he was rather disappointed by the lack of flavor and surprised how tough the steak was. Keep in mind it was cooked medium rare so should have been much more tender. We got the mashed potatoes which were average. We also got the asparagus which was undercooked and topped with sauteed onions throwing off the flavor profile. We did enjoy the outside deck with breathtaking views and free entry to the upstairs lounge.",

I mostly chose this particular steakhouse because of the rooftop bar with a nice view of The Strip. It's nice when friends and family are visiting to find a place with a nice meal and also a nice view.  We all started with a drink to enjoy with our meals. I ordered a red wine that was very good and my brother loved the IPA he ordered. My husband's Sauvignon Blanc was not good. The bread basket had salted rolls and pretzel bread. The bread was okay, but not great. The tapenade served with the bread was very good.  My meal was the Voodoo Menage A Trois. This included a six ounce filet, lobster tail, two giant prawns, and mashed potatoes. Everything on the plate was great with the filet being the stand out. Next time I'd probably just get a filet. My brother ordered the filet and really enjoyed it as well. Our side of Whipped Potatoes was creamy and delicious. My husband ventured out with the Duroc Pork Rib Eye and really enjoyed it. This meal looked more like a platter with a large serving of pork, mashed potatoes, and some roasted peaches. We were all very happy with our meals.   Our waiter was friendly and attentive. He was on top of drink refills and making sure we had everything we needed. The waiter also encouraged us to check out the rooftop bar area with the view after we placed our orders. It was a nice spot to take some photos and take the view of The Strip in.   After making my reservation I remembered hearing that the Rio has a locals discount for some of their restaurants. I checked out the website and found that VooDoo is 25% off with a local ID, Total Rewards card, and the printed coupon from their website. What a deal! This was the icing on the cake to a lovely meal.",

Food took a bit longer than expected but the company was good so we didn't care. The only thing I didn't liked it was our server, he was a bit rude as he brought the menu and we said no alcohol drinks then later on we changed our minds and seem to be a bit upset about it as the restaurant was full and seems that he was quiet busy.. not excuse anyway. Overall food was good prices high, wait okay.. but the view thought completely change the whole game it was beautiful and worth it I'll be coming back for more in the future hopefully we will be treat better this time without a rude service!",

I was alone on a work trip, although there is no bar seating, I was sat in a very nice booth with an amazing views of the city and the voodoo zipline.  The servers all came by and talked with me, it didn't feel awkward sitting alone in such a nice area.   I had the menage -- surf n turf - steak, lobster and prawns.  I ordered the steak medium, it came out perfect.  The lobster was succulent and the large prawns were fresh and great with the dish.  Mash potatoes and veggies were also cooked to perfection.  The bread the serve at the table is wonderful and the olive tapenade and oils are one of the best iv had.  I am so happy I went up to the 50th floor for dinner.  I was then able to take my drink outside onto their huge outdoor patio.  Food isn't served out there but there are lounge seats and tables to mingle- or head up the stars to voodoo nightclub.",

For our main course we tried the surf and turf( 6oz steak, tiger prawns and lobster tail) and 21 day aged rib eye! The food and ambiance was perfect. The lighting was a tad dim. The view from where we sat was romantic. A must try and I'll def be back when I'm in Vegas!",

MY husband and  my steak were made to perfection! Big portions enough to share. I met Kai'noa in the restroom while she was helping a young lady who was having a panic attack not knowing she was having dinner so high up we both helped calm her down. Kai'noa offered to help us take a beautiful picture of our group outside she was a perfect hostess she was just so helpful and friendly. And went above and beyond. I will definitely be coming back to voodoo for the food and GREAT service in June  for my birthday.",

We ordered the New York strip steak with whipped potatoes and the lamb chops entree. Both were delicious. I was a big fan of the crispy potato cake you get with the lamb chops but my husbands whipped potatoes made up for it. They were delicious and definitely could serve two people. It took a little bit to get our food and our server gave us complimentary glasses of champagne for being patient. - nice touch! Service was great and everyone was attentive.

    "text": "Came here on an off weeknight for early dinner with mom and dad for their anniversary (48 years!) with high hopes.   We were one of 2 tables in our half of the dinning room and were still seated adjacent to an older couple who didn't need to hear our chatter anymore than we needed to hear them... I don't want to make the servers run marathons, but a little space (1 table!) when you're dead please?  Our server was a very nice man and very capable professional, I am sorry I do not recall his name.  Our drinks: Mom and dad have this sick affinity for a monstrous concoction: a Midori Melon vodka martini. It has a signature green hue and icky taste but they love it. they also KNOW that most bartenders drop sour apple or sour mix of some kind into this so when they are away from home, they always say JUST MIDORI MELON AND VODKA when ordering... We could see the drinks were wrong from across the room as they had a different lighter green hue and god knows what poured into them although the bartender SWORE he did it right. We're not stupid. The color was off, the taste was off. Thankfully our wonderful server took them back and got them fresh martinis with no green ooze and we moved on.  For the food, the short rib bruschetta sounded awesome and it wasn't. I was hoping for the meat to have the \"fall off the bone\" quality but it was more of the \"overcooked Korean BBQ boneless shortrib\" variety. I ate what meat I could rescue from under the pile of our of place citrus salad and ricotta and left that and the bread behind.   The lobster bisque was pleasant and contained actual lobster bits in it.  The heirloom baby beets were fantastic and I highly recommend this dish. I'd pay more for a dinner sized version an my entree. Great flavors all around. There was a disproportionate amount of goat cheese to the rest of the salad ingredients that could have been better mitigated by having more salad but that's not a complaint... well done with this dish and the high point of our meal.  the flat iron steak was ordered med rare and came out unevenly cooked, in part because of the tapered shape... the edges were easily medium to medium well and the inner portion had some red in it. This resulted in about half the $44.00 steak being overcooked. This is regrettably pretty decent since the $47.00 petite filet was completely overcooked and DRY. It was ordered medium rare and had NO PINK much less any red in it and was the TOUGHEST, DRIEST FILET I have ever seen in my life. I didn't even know that cut of steak could be ruined but here we are.  I asked mom and dad to send the meat back but that's not how they roll and I wasn't about to make a scene or embarrass them on their special day.  Voodoo... you're supposed to be a steakhouse. Please start cooking like one for the future guests.  A small saving grace to the meal was our server overhearing it was their anniversary brought out a complimentary dessert for them to share which again pointed to his professionalism and helped us end on an upswing.  Our bill was well over $200.00 for the 3 of us and we tipped over 20% so it was a nice chunk of change for a very disappointing meal overall. I'm a tourist but mom and dad are local and none of us will be coming back.",

Everyone enjoyed the food and drinks. We had sea bass, filet, risotto, mac and cheese, asparagus, beet salad, wedge salad. Tiramisu dessert was to die for. Warmed bread at beginning was yummy. Presentation of drinks was cool. Some came out in special box cases with dry ice smoke \"release\" as you get drunk.   So many \"rules\" took away from our group's overall experience. Must spend $30 min a person, can't split you meal or you will be charged $10 per person, if you use your players card to get a discount, it must be on all one check, but then the checkout process was a nightmare.   We spent about $100 a person on average here. It's not cheap. So the service should be on point.   We had a smoother, much better check out experience for another large group meal at the yard house (another casino) the night before, no issues whatsoever! Fast good food, fast service and sharp waiters, constant drink refills, fast checkout, all separate checks. And the food there was a fraction of the cost of our Saturday meal.",

    "text": "Husband and I came here for dinner prior to seeing Penn and Teller.  This wasn't our first pick in places to go but due to logistical issues we thought it would be best to eat at the Rio before the show.    We made a Wed night res (that morning) via open table.  The res was early, due to the show time, maybe 630 ish.  We did get a window seat with a wonderful view without requesting it.  We arrived on time and were seated promptly.  We started with sangrias and French onion soup.  The soup was ok, little too much meat flavor (maybe lamb?) for my liking.  For dinner I had the lamb dish over pasta.  It was ok, but very fatty meat.  Husband had the filet.  He requested it med rare with horseradish crusting.  It was cooked more to med well.  The horseradish was really not a crust as much as it was a thick horseradish sauce on the top.  We shared the fingerling potatoes - they were fantastic.  Took a bit of time to get the check but the staff seemed very busy, so I give them a pass offer that.  Other than that, service was good and servers were pleasant.    The best part was that we got a surprise 25% off the check when we showed out show tickets.  Overall, great view, ok food, good service, and the price isn't so bad if you get the 25% discount.  I would not recommend for dinner, but you should go to the bar, have a cocktail, and take in the view.",

Stopped here for dinner before seeing Penn and Teller one night this week. Was not as expensive as some of the strip hotels and the food was better than I expected.  Service was top notch.  You can walk out onto the roof bar and see all around the tower - great views!  They also have a zip line between the towers, fun to watch but be warned they shoot you over and then have to pull you back, two rides for the price of one!  Anyway, food was good, prices were good and services was stunning - worth taking a trip off the strip to visit the Rio while you're in town.",

The security from the club and the hostess downstairs are really starting to change my opinion of the Hotel as a whole. They tried telling me I couldn't go to the restaurant for a drink and I had to pay to go to the club instead. I spend quite a bit in this casino and don't like this sort of treatment. In my opinion the club upstairs is really downgrading the overall experience I've come to expect.",

My table shared the witch doctor drink which was fun for us because of the fog coming out of the goblet. Everything tasted really good and fresh, but the service was kind of slow. 4 stars for the great food and friendly server (even though he was a bit slow).   PS: If you choose to eat here while the night club is going on, I believe it is free to enter after dinner. I didn't really like the music that they played (top 40 from 2009-2013) when I checked out the club, but there were a lot of people there.",

We didn't want have to leave our hotel & drive or have to deal of getting a cab or Uber so we decided stay put and picked this place. We ordered Ceasar Salad, Shrimp Cocktail as appetizer. The Shrimp Cocktail was yummy - the sauce was perfect. Both of my girl friends ordered their scallops with grits and mushroom. I ordered the crab and lobster pasta salad with cream sauce. Jay ordered their Filet, another friend ordered Rib Eye and Salmon. Jay's filet was overcooked - he asked for medium rare and it came medium. It was more cooked than he and I liked. The scallops were delicious - melt in your mouth! Loved the flavor. Our friends liked their salmon and Rib Eye. Mine was disappointingly ok - the crab was cooked a little too long so it was a little rubbery. There wasn't much cream in the sauce and just needed more flavor. We were starving so no one bothered to complain. We also ordered sides - asparagus, truffle Mac & Cheese and French Fries. The asparagus was too al-dente for my taste, loved the Truffle Mac & Cheese and of course, you can't possible go wrong with Pomme Frits!!! Their selection of bread was good as well. And love the view! I just wished for the price we paid for dinner, it was perfect. Can't have it all I guess.",

The atmosphere had a cool vibe that led up to the name but none of the decor wowed me. It was a panoramic view of the strip (well ours was part of the strip). We were seated right by a window which was great, but the beauty of  seeing the strip was ruined by a huge glare.   We both ordered the Filet Mignon. I ordered mine medium and it came out more medium well, which i didn't mind too much. I could eat steak everyday if I could, but theirs wasn't as tender as filet mignon should be. Their filet mignon was decent. I also ordered their truffle mac and cheese and I must say that was rather delicious! I would come back for the Mac & Cheese alone.   As for service goes... it was probably the worst I've received from an upscale restaurant. I agree with another reviewer about the service being terrible from a certain waiter. I know my BF & I are young but come on, don't make it obvious that you don't want to serve us cuz you think we won't tip well! We actually tipped more than we should have! We were rarely checked up on,it took forever to take our order, & we actually had to get up and find him to get our check. He didn't sound happy to be there or anything, we felt as if we were a bother wtf.  Would we ever go back? Possibly. If I had a different waiter, I would. I would def go get a Total Rewards card tho, saves you quite a bit of money.",

So I read some reviews, and one caught me, it talked about dress code. And I agreed with the reader. If youre suppose to dress up, dress up. I dont want to see people coming up in shorts and tees, But thats just me.. First impression of the place. It was fun, the art was diffferent. Got the hostess, and she directed my girlfriend and I to my parents, where they where at the bar. Decent size bar, the bar tender was nice. We then went to our table, and was greeted by our waiter. Our waiter was okay, but wasnt the best. For the amount of money you spend there, he should on his game. But lucky for us, he was a nice guy.   The food came out in a timely fashion. The steaks where cooked to what we asked for. Everyone enjoyed there food, was quite delicious. We where to full to have dessert. But they looked amazing. Instead we had coffee and tea..Also before I forget. Get yourself the Total Rewards card, It definitely helps saving some money. So if you want to save alittle money go check it out..    Afterwards we decided to head up to the voodoo club. And that was a whole different story on its own.",

I've had better. The view was nice, the service was ok. Nothing fantastic, matches the rundown hotel experience. At least no bugs in my food. Can't say the same for our hotel room.",

The bread basket was full of a tasty assortment, and refills came easy. We all ordered various steaks which were cooked and seasoned to perfection! The seafood pasta was also rich and delicious. We loved all the sides we tried: the truffle Mac and Cheese (the best!!), creamed spinach, mushrooms, sauteed broccoli, and potato puree. To top off this amazing meal, when we mentioned to our waiter we were seeing Penn and Teller we got 20% off our bill! Awesome all around!",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars, but I'm feeling friendly because it was a nice experience. The 3 1/2 total rating is incredibly accurate.   Had a really nice dinner here. The service was solid, view was beautiful, and while the food wasn't memorable, it was really good.   PROS: As most say, the view of the LV Valley. They have a nice deck where you can go out and lounge and take in the view.   The service was nice and efficient.  Everything tasted good, but nothing rocked my socks so much I would have to come back for it. My husband really enjoyed his ribeye, and he's hard to please. So you get a whole star added to your rating for that.  Truffle Mac and cheese was also tasty.  There is a 20% discount if you show your Penn & Teller tickets.. Which you'll need because...  CONS: it's much too pricey for the quality! This is fine dining prices but Outback Steakhouse quality dishes. Yes, it's plated nicely and yes the restaurant is pretty, but you're not going to get a unique flavor explosion here. It's good, just nothing to write home about.   The Witch Doctor is a giant and cool looking drink but it's $31! Buyer beware. The price is not on the menu... That should have been our first clue.   My $13 salad I could have thrown together at home. It was mediocre tomatoes, bitter lettuce, crumbled soggy burrata, and a light drizzle of balsamic. Ehh. If you're a fine steakhouse, please use high quality produce, cheese, and balsamic.   The bread had potential but was rock hard.   Overall, a nice meal, a nice view, and other than my empty wallet, nothing substantial to complain about not look forward to for next time.",

I had the French onion soup, filet, and we split two sides Mac n cheese and the broccoli. Everything was wonderful! French onion soup was my favorite I loved the peppercorn taste it had. Broccoli was just that, broccoli but nothing to complain about. My steak was cooked perfect and we couldn't stop eating the Mac n cheese!   I will go back next time I'm in Vegas!",

When I made the reservation on Open Table, I told them that it was my birthday and that we wanted a table on the window, which we got, but not the best view of the strip.  We both had a chance to get up and walk around the restaurant and saw at least three open tables on the window with an amazing view of the Strip, kind of disappointed about not getting one of those tables.  Other than that, the food was great, the Lobster Bisque was AMAZING, we both got the Voodoo Menage a Trios (fillet, lobster tail & shrimp) which was also delicious. They brought me cake with a candle for my birthday, service was good as well.    After, we went up to the Voodoo Rooftop Lounge, was nice that we didn't have to pay a cover because we had just had dinner.  Views were awesome, music was good and the crowd was right around our age which was nice since we are not 20 or 30 somethings!",

I ordered the coconut shrimp for appetizer and that was good, 4 prawns fried well in a mango sauce. I ordered a 20 oz Ribeye on the bone. Of the 20 ounces, there was 5 ounces of meat and that meat wasn't even that good. The rest of it was fat and bone. Seriously guys? what kind of steak is that to serve to a customer? When I pointed it out to the server he was like yeah thats a lot of fat. Not sure what kind of customer service that was. Good thing I had a coupon for 25% off. They were lucky I was not hungry due to the previous evening's amazing food at Andre's, which charged the same price for their steak yet it was a 1000 times better.  Guys do not serve inferior steak, you just lost a customer for life and I will tell everyone to avoid Voodoo Steak.",

The truffle Mac and cheese was a little over loaded with truffle, but tasty. We also ordered the asparagus. It was very good. We never ordered drinks because we were not offered a drink list. Overall the food was very good, but the service didn't warrant the $45-$60 price that we paid for entrees. I don't think that I would go back due to the underwhelming service. However I might get the pasta to-go. It was yummy.",

When they  bussed the table they stacked every plate on top of each other, on the table in front of us. Gross! Then left all the crumbs and never came back.

To the hostess that greeted us when we walked in.  To the beautiful table we had (we were on the West side so we looked out to the mountains)(if you want to see the strip views - ask for the East side or a view of the strip) Regardless ALL views at the top of the Rio are fantastic! Well JOHN our waiter was WONDERFUL.  He was tentative, funny, informative about all items on the menu and I am so glad that we had JOHN as our drinks, bread, salad and our main course was served superbly!  After we received our drinks (and before our salad) JOHN suggested we go out on the balcony of the Voodoo Lounge and check out the view.  WOW it was amazing!  we sat out there with our drinks for about 20 minutes.  Taking photos and just enjoying the spectacular sights!  JOHN let us kow that if you eat dinner you have access to the Voodoo Lounge all night.  We told him we had Penn & Teller tickets - so he told us to come back after the show and enjoy the night in the Voodoo Lounge.  How cool is that?  Free entry to a club in Las Vegas.  WOW! As soon as we walked back to our table - JOHN served our salad.  JOHN was on the ball!  Boy, I sure hope Voodoo Steak realizes what a gem JOHN is to have as an employee.  We finished up our meal.  All unbelievably cooked to perfection.  I had the salmon and my husband had the rib eye.  Baked potatoes for our sides. Well we knew we had to leave soon as the show was soon upon us.  We didn;t want to go.  We just wanted to stay up there all night.  So back down that fabulous elevator and onto the show. What a great night!  Penn & Teller we great and a huge THANK YOU to the RIO Hotel for entertaining us! Cheers!",

We are locals and received a nice discount along with our players card  We started off with cocktails which were very tasty. Apps included the meat and cheese board along with steak tartare. Our sides were mushrooms, whipped potatoes, Mac and cheese, and the risotto. The risotto was a bit under cooked and stiff but all in all they were very good. The four of us split two meals. Yes, they charge a \"split\" fee but what good restaurant doesn't?  We had the tomahawk steak the the \"land and sea\". Filet and scallops. I love steak, and the steaks were fantastic but those scallops were to die for. We will definitely be back to try other menu items. Thank you John for a wonderful dinner.",

    "text": "After going back and forth between a few different restaurants, we finally made a decision to dine at VooDoo Steakhouse located on the 50th floor of the Rio.  The ride up to the top was in a glass elevator with a great view of the strip on your way up.  The view only got better when we were seated at our window table.  The candlelit atmosphere of the restaurant paired with the bright lights of the strip were beautiful. Once we were seated, ordered drinks and dinner, everything was great.  My husband ordered the Menageatrois  (filet mignon, lobster tail, and jumbo shrimp) while I ordered the miso glazed salmon.  My husband loved his dinner, mine was good, but not enough miso glaze, and the bok choy was a little salty.  We also shared a crab cake and Caesar salad appetizer as well a the chocolate cake for dessert.  Everything we ordered was served fresh and we did not feel rushed during our dinner.  In fact, everything was spread out as to not be rushed to finish or too much time in between.  The service was great too.  Once we were finished, we were also granted free access to the VooDoo Lounge and Nightclub one floor up.  Great views, but at 10:30/11, it was dead in there. All in all, we had a great date night at VooDoo.",

What could have very easily been a horrible turn of events ended up being literally one of the best dining experiences we'd ever had. John, the manager; Sam, our server; and the rest of the wait staff that assisted during our meal were all spectacular! While the tasting event had been cancelled, they didn't skip a beat; our Groupon was honored and we were treated to the best 5-course experience ever! The food was delicious, the wine pairings were perfect, and our whole table walked away completely satisfied.   Voodoo Steakhouse will be a constant on our list whenever we return to Vegas. The entire staff made our evening absolutely amazing and it was the perfect way to close out our vacation.",

We also ordered a drink that wasn't on the menu but came in a lantern with dry ice, it was pretty cool! The drink itself was delicious and strong. Despite this I'm giving them 3 stars for a couple of reasons. The lobster tail that came with my meal was tough and stuck to the shell, I hardly got any pieces off of it and I gave up trying to eat it because it was impossible to chew. The lady who was handing out the bread was so sweet and gave us great service but our server was awful! He was not attentive, short with us, and when we asked him questions he didn't really care to answer them. We wished our tip could have gone to the bread lady because she gave us better service than our server! For the price that we paid here we expected better service.",

We chose VooDoo Steakhouse because of the view on top of the Rio and because the reviews were very good. We started out with the \"witch doctor\" cocktail, which we shared between the three of us. It was delicious and very cool to see the dry ice \"smoke\" when the server poured it into the glass. Next, we each ordered filet mignon and then all picked a different side because they're big enough to share. I've never had a better steak in my life. It's a little pricey, but it's to be expected in a tourist city. I'd absolutely go back!",

The food was okay, not terrible but not amazing. The filet mignon wasn't too bad, it was cooked the way we like it. The lobster bisque had a dalop of cream in it which threw me off and I feel made it have a slightly off flavor. The best thing we had was the Banana pudding cake or whatever it's called. The presentation as it's being served is really neat and then it was really tasty since the sugar carmelizes from the heat of being on fire from the presentation. Honestly the main reason we came here is so we didn't have to rush out dinner before watching Penn and Teller. Would I make my way just to eat here again, no. Would I recommend eating here for the view, maybe, probably if you do the zipline too. Would I eat here again when I go back to watch Penn and Teller, probably.",

Upon our arrival we asked for a window seat. They were fortunately able to accommodate our last-minute request within only a few minutes of our arrival. The views were amazing and we had the added bonus of watching the strip lights come on once the sun set. Beautiful.   A bread basket is standard for all parties and service was friendly and efficient. I noticed a party next to us of over-sized drinks that looked fun but I wasn't drinking that night so I can't comment on the alcohol.   My friend had the filet mignon and I had the scallops. Both were perfectly prepared and plated. I was very impressed with attention to detail. We also ordered several sides large enough for sharing. The lobster mac and cheese was okay although not as good as other posts suggest. However, if you're not worrying about carbs, worth a try. We also tried the green beans and the spinach. Both were good as well.   If you're on a budget and would still like to try this gem, I would recommend a salad and side. Probably just as satisfying at 1/3 the cost.  Don't forget to go out on the viewing deck before or after your meal. It's beautiful to say the least.",

If I was just basing this review on the view and the service, it would easily be 4 or 5 stars. Unfortunately, I wasn't very happy with my steak, considering the high price. I got the Filet Mignon, medium. It was flavorless and a bit dry. I didn't even finish it! Luckily, I got the truffle mac & cheese on the side and THAT was great!

I am not a fan of overpaying for just okay food and a great view.  Go to VooDoo steak if you want a romantic or memorable dinner.    The food is not bad...the average Joe may even appreciate it.  But the foodie in me was not impressed by anything we had.  I tried the Lobster Bisque, The Scallops, and the Sea Bass.  Of the three the Bisque was the best....with a nice touch of small apple bits mixed in with the lobster chunks on top.  The apple played nice with the sweet lobster bisque and even nicer with the lobster chunks.  Other than that nothing was memorable enough to warrant a return tasting.",

The views were amazing. As far as the food- we had the Mac n Cheese- yummy. Asparagus was tasty and we had the Australian Wagyu Steak (we shared the steak and the side were family style) OMG it was delicious, flavorful, well seasoned and cooked right. We shared all 3 items and were stuffed.. Forget the desserts, no room. Yes it is pricey but the quality of the food was well worth the money- you only live life once so enjoy it!  We will be coming back!!",

We should have chosen differently. The service was decent, our server was fairly attentive. The food was disappointing...for the price of the steaks, I would have expected something a little more on par with Gordon Ramsay Steak. The real issue came after we got home and later that night. We both became quite ill, with signs and symptoms indicating food poisoning. We called and informed the restaurant and were brushed off, stating they \"would look into it.\" No apology or renumeration was offered.  So if you're looking for excellent service and superb steak, go to Gordon Ramsay's!",

We were told because we did not have a reservation they could not sit us by the window, but throughout our entire meal there were at least 6 window tables open, that were never seated. The staff was not friendly and we had better service at the casino buffet. The nicest person there was the photographer who was so kind and took our picture out on the patio, and to my surprise caught my boyfriend's proposal as well.  We tipped him better then our waiter. The food was average. I had the free range chicken, and my fiance had the Ribeye. If the service had been a little better, I might consider going back.",

The views of the strip are incredible from your seat but with dinner you get free access to the club level where you can go outside and experience the views from their rooftop bar.    It's a steak place but all of their food was great!  We started with the crab artichoke dip - it was just OK.  The heirloom tomato salad was scrumptious.  In our party of four, we had the veal, sea bass and two different cuts of steak - one with the horseradish crust.  Every entree was awesome!

It's been a couple months since I have been in and they have since changed the menu.  Although I am deeply saddened they eliminated the Heirloom Tomato salad which was the best in the country, I understand things have to be changed up sometimes.  However, the bread was insulting enough to log in to write about it.  When you pay $60 for a steak, you want more than prepackaged dinner rolls and a pretzel roll.  Not comparing to the amazing bread they used to serve, but a pretzel roll puts this at the \"bar food\" level not the $60 per steak level.  The steak was fantastic as usual (though mine was served medium rare not medium).  The service was still great, though he was uninformed of the yelp promotion.  (The Amuse was AMAZING!)",

When the waiter checked in to ask me how my meal was I mentioned that the carrots were undercooked and so was the lobster tail. He did not offer to fix it and just looked at me and walked away.

This was the perfect place!   First off the restaurant is on the 50th floor. Yes you read that right. 5-0! The elevator ride is crazy fast but once you get to the top and see the huge glass windows and the Las Vegas skyline your breath is taken away.   Before we sat down for dinner we went outside to their patio area to get some fresh air and of course take lots of pictures. Beautiful background.   On to dinner. I ordered the salmon with Mac and cheese and broccoli and it was so mouthwateringly good. Each bite was better than the one before. The other ladies opted for the surf and turf. Now I'm not a steak girl but that lobster had me wanting to order a to go meal and I was overly stuffed already. The portions are generous. Yes, this restaurant is pricy but it is absolutely worth every penny.   If I ever make it back to Las Vegas I will be stopping by here again.",

    "text": "This place is truly a hidden gem. I am a frequent visitor to Las Vegas and never considered anything in the Rio before, just because it was off strip and not that \"popular\" compared to the newer hotels.  We ended up trying this place because of an offer we had through Caesar's and it blew Ruth Chris and BLT steak away!!  Service was very good, the steak had so much flavor and the portions were huge!  Tip - if you check in on yelp, you get a free amuse (small appetizer) which I think is the chefs choice. We got the short ribs and it was very delicious!  We ordered a 3 course special. Choice of Caesar salad or lobster bisque, choice of filet or rib eye with diver scallops, whipped potatoes and asparagus. It finishes off with a creme brulee. When I hear 3 course or preset meals, I automatically think smaller portions... this was NOT the case. The cost per person was about $95 per person, such a great deal!  The Caesar salad was full portion and delicious. Very strong on the anchovies which I surprisingly liked. We ordered two bone in rib eyes, both cooked medium rare. My steak came over cooked and looked different than the other steak (maybe a different grill?) but the other one was perfectly cooked and had so much flavor! That's truly the only reason why it's not a 5 star review. The potatoes and asparagus were delicious too.  We also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese. Oh, my, goodness! It was a HUGE portion and had so much flavor with large portions of lobster in it!  The creme brulee dessert was also spot on with a nice sugar crust on top, not soggy at all.  I HIGHLY recommend VooDoo steak house!",

Going up to the 50th floor was a fun and fast elevator ride.  We were seated by the window as requested and had a gorgeous view of the city.  Every single staff member was accommodating, fun and knowledgeable.   We were taken care of by Jamal as our server and Effren bused our table. Neither of them missed a beat and both had a witty sense of humor that further complimented our experience.  We did not drink wine, but the cocktails were excellent.  The sommelier did pay us a visit and she was also friendly and knowledgeable.  My husband and I each had their three-course special which was a fillet mignon with sides and dessert. The steak was one of the best I have ever had and was cooked to perfection. The lobster bisque and creme brulee was delicious.  However the show stopper was our dramatic appetizer called Fire and Ice.  It is a hot and cold seafood tower that literally features dry ice and fire.  It's not cheap, but it would feed a table of four.  We ate it as an entree and ended up boxing up a lot of left overs.  It was an exceptional meal experience.  Highly recommended.",

The manager (didn't get his name but he's explaining the birthday drink in the posted photo) greeted us and immediately wished Carl a happy birthday (he knew due to a comment that was left on our Open Table reservation).    Our server, Billy, was outstanding.  His knowledge of the menu and attention to detail were literally second to none.  He offered suggestions to compliment what was ordered.  He was extremely friendly and treated us like valued personal guests.  This is my second time eating there, and the steak is still something that legends are made of.  I had the dry-aged rib eye, and it was hands down the best steak I have ever had in my life.  Other members had the lobster bisque, prawns, 8 oz. filet, and beet salad, and there was not a single suggestion on how to make anything better.  We even had a \"food sensitive\" person in our party and the staff was able to make sure her needs were tended to.  After the unbelievable meal, we ordered after dinner drinks and were able to enjoy them outside on the patio, fully taking advantage of the breathtaking views offered from the 50th floor of the Rio.  Of course, all of this decadence comes at a price, but if you're in Las Vegas and aren't spoiling yourself, then you're doing Las Vegas wrong.  Do yourself a favor and add Voodoo steak to your list of \"must-try\" restaurants.",

    "text": "Want a nice place for dinner with good food and service?  How about a place that gives an amazing view of the Las Vegas Strip?  VooDoo Steakhouse is one solution!  Located at the top of the Masquerade Tower of The Rio Hotel & Casino, the view are great!  Steak and seafood is their thing.  I've never had a meal I didn't like here.  Steaks that I've have always been perfectly cooked and the lobster tails and shrimp have also been great time after time!  They have an outdoor observation deck for before, during, or after dinner.  After dinner, you get free admission to the VooDoo Lounge- which also has its own outdoor observation deck.  (FYI- it gets windy up their!)  My only issue is that the kitchen will eventually close, so if you go late for dinner, you may not get to order desert.  This has happened to me a couple times now when I've had dinner after 9pm.  However in each case the waiter found something sweet to finish off the meal anyway - just not ordered off the desert menu.",

It was worth every moment from meeting the bartender from Portugal to walking outside and looking at the 180 degree view from the 50th floor. Spectacular. Dinner was fantastic. Lobster bisque, a 28 day aged steak prepared properly, Mac and cheese enough for two and asparagus. No room for dessert. I was in heaven. Great meal, great view and superb service by Sam. Good stories, regular attention and lots of knowledge about the menu. Just what you want. Love the mystical decor. Matches the name. Put this restaurant on your list.

The service was awesome and the server seemed very knowledgeable.  The food left something to be desired.  I had lamb chops and my lamb was great.  My wife had the surf and turf and hers was not as good.  Especially the steak, for it being a steakhouse we were expecting a much better tasting steak.  It was very bland.  I saw other people needing to use A1 steak sauce which is usually a no no in a steakhouse if this caliber.  But for the price would have expected a much better tasting steak.  The drinks are great the service is great and you can get right into the night club without paying, so that's a great perk.",

He recommended walking out onto the rooftop for the views.. Once we were seated the waiters were very attentive and helpful with the menu selections.. We ordered to share the lobster Mac and cheese, and we both ordered the filet.  The lobster Mac and cheese had no flavour of cheese and only tiny pieces of lobster.

As a bonus, the evening we dined,  the outdoor patio deck was the perfect temperature wind no wind whatsoever.   My wife and I ordered the lump crab and artichoke dip with boursin cheese, pita chips (was very tasty and loads of crab) and I just had to have the seared foie gras which was seared to absolute perfection, beautiful in texture with that buttery rich flavor I so miss since California, the nanny state has outlawed foie gras. making it easier to score crack cocaine on a Saturday night out.  My wife had a glass of wine which she stated was very good, sorry, I forgot the brand but believe it was Ferrari-Carano Merlot and although our families favorite is their Cabernet Sauvignon, it has been impossible to find the Ferrari-Carano Cabernet Sauvignon lately.   We ordered the menage a tois, a filet mignon, lobster tail and shrimp for our main course and were not disappointed. The steak was cooked perfectly to a medium rare, and the lobster tail was sweet and delicious. The shrimp were large in size and equally delicious with a sweet aftertaste. We also ordered their truffle mac and cheese and it really was rather delicious! The broccoli sauteed in olive and garlic oil was very good and cooked to our liking.  Our waiter, Jose was spot on, attentive with a healthy sense of humor and seemed to go out of his way to please not only us, but the other guests in his station. The timing of the meal was not rushed and each course arrived in perfect timing.  I did not find the bill exorbitant for the experience and quality of food and a quick scan of the dining room proved that there certainly everyone was having a good time. We will return again and again for sure.  As a side note, in the past we have enjoyed a most incredible New Years Eve party here on the 50th floor of the VooDoo Steakhouse and Lounge, one my family constantly remembers as an amazingly great time, as a result, this location will always hold a special place in our hearts.",

Regardless of the Vegas premium you pay for some of the finer restaurants, this place is straight up not worth it- period. Yes, it's 50 floors up and looks great at night but all of that is haunted by below average appetizers, over priced wine (seriously over priced..), and some of the saltiest fare one can purchase. I'm not going to rail every dish but some notables or warnings would be to avoid the coconut shrimp (laughable..could bounce all the back up from 50 floors), lobster bisque (I've had better from the grocery section), and the Voodoo Caesar salad. I will say that the Caesar reminded exactly of the tray of salad you can get at Costco with a little siracha mixed in, might try that at home..  In short, pop in for a cocktail and a picture then bail.  Cheers!",

Upon receiving her drink my fiance noticed something floating in it. Once we were able to fish it our, we realized that it was a HUGE bug. She immediately brought it over to one of the managers to show him, and what was his response? Basically nothing. He comped her drink and that was it. I'm sorry but I expected much more from such a \"high class\" establishment. We opted not to eat there after this, so they lost out on money there.

Greeted by our hostess we were seated at the window with a great view just at sunset as we we're eating before the show. We made reservations on the open table app and it was super easy.   I ordered a nice Malbec and my sister a Merlot. Our waiter was very helpful and informative about the menu. Good size restaurant, with a nice size bar and a very good wine list.   I had 1/2 dozen oysters and they were on the small side but very nice. (My apologies can not remember where they were from). Came with horseradish, lemon and seafood sauce. Not the toppings I would have preferred, however it was very tasty, and 10 out of 10 on that choice, My sister ordered the onion soup. It was very cheesy, lots of onions and was made with a nice beef broth, also delicious. There were about 10 appetizers on the menu and it was a tough call which to order, they all sounded great.   Bread basket of LOTS of assorted warm rolls arrived with a great deal of butter arrived at the table and I hate to admit it, but I tried a couple - yummy, they were good!   Great menu selection and it was hard to choose, but for my entree I had a 8 oz filet with a side of creamed spinach, it was rare, just the way I ordered it and it melted in your mouth it was soooooo good. My sister ordered the \"Trio\"; steak, lobster and prawns. The steak was a nice 4oz, the lobster was a nice size, but the \"prawns\" looked like shrimp....they were certainly on the small side, she received two and I was lucky enough to get one. Very delicious and buttery tasting, even though they were on the small side.  It came with potato and vegetables and they were kind enough to eliminate the potato and add some more vegetables.   For dessert sis had the creme brulee and said it was just great, I did manage to get my spoon in there and taste it, and yummy was that good!   We received our discount using total rewards which was outstanding, and my great sister picked up the tab! It is a very pricy menu and the majority of entrees come a la carte.   All in all, service was great, food just wonderful and view from the top was stellar!!!! Even got to hop out on to the patio and it was really nice, small breeze and perfect for some photos of the city.",

Wife's filet ordered medium was really rare, sent back to return well done. She couldn't eat it. Mine was medium rare but  nothing I would go back for. If I remember, bill with tip was about $170.

    "text": "Uncertain what a compelling reason to come here again would be. The view from the deck is very good at night - but you could accomplish that with just a quick expensive drink at the tiny bar. Waiter running around and apologizing quite a bit. Staff looked like they wanted to do better than they were. The Caesar salad was terrible - pre-made and wilted with what had to be bag croutons; at $16 it is a crime. The filet with garlic & horseradish crust very good. Had to wait a long while to get a beer and a large time gap between wilted salad and steak. Not to mention the Rio feels a little tired and less clean then I would like; feels like a Kmart that does know they are about to go under.",

He can maintain a great conversation, a talent of a True bartender, while mixing up a lot of drinks for the wait staff and other guests.  Years ago the InterContinental in NYC had a famous, long-term bartender, I think the Rio could brag about having Kenny!",

We started with the Veal cheek. We've never had it before and decided to give it a try. Although it was slightly greasy ( I think that is how it is supposed to be) it was pretty damn good.    For my entree, I chose the VooDoo Menage A Trois which consisted of a 6oz petite filet, 4 oz lobster tail, jumbo prawns and I chose mashed potatoes. SERIOUSLY, oh my gawd! The whole meal just absolutely blew my mind. The steak was perfectly cooked, seasoned, tender & juicy. The lobster was prepared in an amazing sauce & was hands down the best I have ever had!  Pricey? Yes. BUT in this case you get what you pay for. Amazing service, food & ambiance. Thank you VooDoo for making the whole trip worth it!",

My wife and I were lucky enough to visit Voodoo Steak on the night after our wedding. It was our first dinner out as husband and wife. We also had the good fortune to be seated in Sam's section, and Sam provided exceptional service all night.  To start, we ordered an appetizer and a bottle of wine. After Sam brought over the wine and poured us each a glass, he invites us to go hang out on the outdoor balcony, overlooking the Strip, while the pork belly with apple and caramelized onions was being prepared. We did, and Sam came out about 5-10 mins later to let us know our first course was ready.  We came in and ate our delicious pork belly, and some tasty starter bread.  It wasn't long before my 8 oz. filet mignon with garlic buttery scallops came out with my wife's seared scallops.  We also ordered truffle mac & cheese. All i can say about them is \"Wow.\"  My mouth is watering just thinking back.  As we finished up dinner, knowing our story, Sam provided complimentary champagne flutes. Classy move, much appreciated. We ordered some tasty coffee ice cream to finish the evening, and we left full, extremely satisfied, and impressed.  As we told Sam, we'll be back for our anniversary next year.",

We had a window table and the view was stunning and we got there before sunset and there to see the sunset, very cool. To start we had a Cheese and Chanteuse plate. It had salami with black truffles that had a great salty, earthy flavor. Also include chorizo, Gruyere, blue cheese, sharp white cheddar and kalamata olives. Also a cranberry toast with 3 jams that were plate licking good! Next was a rich, flavorful lobster bisque except the pieces of lobster were chewy. For a side the Hericot Vert with onions was seasoned well and had a good snap. The bone-in ribeye was a bit over cooked from the medium-rare I ordered. It had a bit to much pepper and overall just an ok steak for the price. Service was good but overall probably wouldn't go back for the food.",

We had reservations and they were expecting us when we arrived, gave last name and they didn't even look down at the book, called upstairs and announced my full name for them to be ready for us.  Very cool.  We ordered the Trio of Filet, Lobster Tail, and Shrimp.  My husband and I each have had Gastric Bypass so we always share and they split the meal for us.  The filet, cooked perfectly rare.  The lobster was a terrific amount of meat.  The shrimp were large and good.  Beautiful presentation on the plate with small amount of mashed potatoes, baby carrot, lemon wedge.  We also tried the bone marrow.  Excellent.  Always wonder why they make it so salty though?  Every restaurant, not just this one.  We also ordered mashed potatoes not knowing we'd have them on the other plate so unfortunately we spent a bit too much with that order.  We had the shishito peppers which were great.  As an appetizer we split the wedge salad - again, absolutely delicious!  After, we went out to the rooftop bar lounge area.  Great view of the strip!  Anyways... didn't have a high expectations of the Rio in general, but we had a great meal experience, the Penn and Teller show was awesome, and we had fun gambling.  We'd go back!",

We were a few minutes early, so we decided to go on the outside deck and enjoy the amazing views over the city from this 50th floor restaurant. Once seated we had an amazing view again. We were given bread to start. It was very plain, but did include some raisin rolls as well(blah). We ordered the wedge salad($13) and really enjoyed it. The Lobster bisque soup came next, and had an excellent taste and left us wanting more ($12)!!  My wife ordered a Lobster, seafood dish($52) and frankly loved it. I ordered the 20oz Ribeye$(49) cooked medium Rare and this led me to my average rating. This is called Voodoo STEAK!  Well my steak was not even close to high end quality. I swear Texas Roadhouse steaks blow it away! It came out well done too! I showed the waiter, he then says \"that tis really off and I will go put in another steak for you.\" I said well we are meeting friends at 10pm so can you rush it, \"sure no problem. I apologize.\" After 20 minutes I decide to keep nibbling on the steak left with me. I nibbled till it was almost done and we finally see waiter again. He says kitchen is behind and its gonna be longer. I go forget it,  I finished steak(which I think was their entire goal anyway) and the $14 martini's and we left. If your wanting nice ambience, nice views, and decent service this place is fine. If your looking for premium grade steaks that are worth the expensive price, avoid!",

    "text": "VooDoo Steak was the best dining experience I had on my recent trip to Vegas. Service was 5-star plus. Here's what happened - we had made a reservation to enjoy a group dinner before the Penn & Teller show on Saturday night - only we mistakenly made the reservation for Friday night. When we showed up on Saturday, the hostesses never doubted us and they tried really hard to find our reservation.  They were super polite about it, no attitude whatsoever, but there was no reservation anywhere on their system. We checked our email, and there is was - for Friday, the night before! We had a fairly large party and it was a Saturday night and very crowded, so we were slightly panicked. The staff moved things around, did a little magic and pulled a rabbit out of a hat! They found us a great table with a view and up we went --- the glass elevator ride is part of the whole experience and once we were seated we still had plenty of time before the show to enjoy the excellent service, terrific cocktails (some of the best in Vegas!) and amazing food. Perfect steak! Sidebar-  its fun, though a bit unnerving for me, to watch brave people ride the zip line while you're eating. I highly recommend VooDoo Steak for a nice evening out, delicious food and amazing service. You should also definitely check out Penn & Teller while you're there, theshow is a blast!",

Not just from the diners and hustle n bustle from the staff. A quite bit of noise was emanating from the upstairs lounge. Great view of the strip if you look out the wall-to-wall windows overlooking this 50th floor restaurant. Service was very good all around. The prices were similar to other steak houses. They gave a basket of breads: a raisin wheat roll, sourdough roll and some parm lavosh. I had the prime 14oz flat iron steak which was nice n juicy. Some sides like broccoli, fries and some mix consisting of potatoes, onions, asparagus n bacon. Everyone ordered different items and it seemed all was good. A few got desserts and even a witch doctor cocktail. The witch doctor and sorbets, they all came bubbling like some hot cauldron thanks to dry ice. After dinner everyone went outside to the balcony to take pictures of the strip then left overall satisfied.",

The only thing Voodoo offers is good service.  As someone that was sober, enjoys a great quality steak, this was a bitter disappointment.  As for their veggie sides, stay away from the broccoli unless you want it as hard as it was delivered, you can't even call it al dente.  The mushrooms were laughable and drenched in salt.  Then we're onto the baked potato.  It is coated with sea salt, I mean coated.  So pay up to sober up, but if sober, I'd give it a pass and run to CraftSteak, Morton's or Charlie Palmers.",

Not too salty. The bone-in ribeye needed something. Can't put my finger on it but the flavor wasn't there. Same for my wife's halibut. For $250 for a dinner for two I've had a lot better. The table was a little dirty/sticky. The chairs were mismatched. Just all in all an expensive so-so meal. Can't recommend.",

We ordered a couple of Prime Ribeye steaks for $58 each and some green beans,  I wasn't expecting Nirvana but what they actually served us appeared and tasted like like large cheap sirloins I'd pay about $7 for at the market.  Another peeve was that they were barely seared.  I would have been happy with a properly cooked mediocre grade Ribeye.  We left very disappointed.",

We order two glasses of the red blend wine & the short rib bruschetta which was amazing. We were so excited for our meal to come. But that's where it went all wrong. . We both ordered a steak with 2 sides.  I ordered my rib eye medium well (warm pink center) and my husband ordered a medium rare New York strip. His came out cooked correct however I was brought out a fully well done steak. I told our waiter and instead of fixing it he went on to argue and say every one cooks differently. Lol. Ok. No. He finally offers to have another steak cooked and brought out. As I sit and wait for my food he finally bring out a now fully bloody rare steak. Obviously now we know they only know how to cook a well done steak and a rare steak. I sent it back again ! Finally it comes back correct after my husbands food is completely gone and I am over the entire experience. I had such high hopes for this place. We will not be back again. Not even a comped anything for this inconvenience. Just here's your $200 bill that I had to argue for my $60 steak to be cooked correctly. Money isn't an issue for us and we frequent tons of steak houses in Vegas. Sadly could not leave this place with a good review. 2 stars because I did enjoy the flavors of the baked Mac & cheese and the bruschetta.",

I would not recommend the spinach salad ... Olive gardens salad is waaaay better!  The lobster bisque was very good, but it fell well short of being great or excellent.  The portion size of the lamb chops were amazing, probably the largest portion of lamb that I have ever seen, but one was of the chops was overcooked, plus they were bland - thank god for the mushrooms and the dipping sauce on the side!! The filet was just alright ... I have had both better and worse.  The mushrooms were probably the best lol  The service was just so-so ... It wasn't amazing, but not horrible.  The price is very high for mediocre food, service, ambiance ... The view is nice, but there is plenty of restaurants with nice views in Vegas.    I do not know that I would ever return here or recommend anyone here ... It was too \"average\" for the excessive cost.",

We had a nice view until we tried to look out the window, which looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a year! The manager came by, we joked about the dirty windows , she said she got another complaint the day before. We also told her about our 91st birthday . There was four of us and we split two steaks and added lobsters to our meals . The lobster was horrible , way over cooked! We mentioned it to our waiter , never asked us if we wanted another, the manager never came over to talk to us about it. Three of our steaks were over cooked. My boyfriend and I didn't even eat our dinner. The waiter came back dropped our check and said they discounted the lobsters and dropped our $300 bill. No birthday dessert after telling two people. I reminded the waiter and he said he would bring something .. too late. I got up , which I never do, working in fine dining myself, and went over to the manager. Told her how terrible the food was and how they forgot the dessert. She said she would adjust our bill and apologized . She took off $30! Such an insult! I told her at the fine dining level, they needed to step it up! That was the most horrible meal I've ever had! Best part of the dinner was the view outside!",

Lots of people suggested that the steaks were amazing and the view was great and they weren't wrong. Sam was our very friendly and happy server, and we will ask for him every time we go from now on. We started out with the Caesar salad which we shared, and they were kind enough to split for us. My wife ordered the fillet mignon and I had the flank steak prepared au poivre, which they don't even offer on the menu for preparation, but the chef was nice enough to do it for me. They should put it on the menu! It was the best au poivre sauce I've ever had in my life! Our steaks were cooked absolutely perfectly. We enjoyed every bit of the experience, add some fantastic wine, I recommend the Ferrari Carano, and they even invited us out to the rooftop for some pictures and to take in the amazing view from the 50th floor of the Rio. Sam was also kind enough to remind us that as locals we were entitled to a 25% discount, unbelievable! Will be back for sure many times.",

Our salad and soup came out right away but the steak came out like 45 minutes later. We asked for it to be cooked medium and when it finally got to our table it was cold and medium rare . My husband refused to eat it saying he was full . I know he wasn't so I sent it back to Cook some more . Once it came back nice and warm the steak tasted ok. Not worth $58 dlls but just ok. Our waitress offered us desert for the inconvenience and when the bill came she charged us for the desert. We didn't say anything cause we didn't want to look like cheap skates . The best part of this restaurant is the ambience. Beautiful view and the staff is super friendly. We ended our night dancing at the night club upstairs which was entertaining due to the diverse crowd. Weather was perfect too. Probably won't be back to eat there but it was a nice experience either way.",

Here, they have class and trust that their food is good so no need to ask continuously.  The atmosphere is romantic and the food is delicious.  We started with the Lobster Bisque and the French Onion Soup.  Then had entrees that simply melted in our mouths...the Menage a Trois was to die for....a filet so tender, lobster tail and shrimp with creamy potatoes and veges.

The dessert was $12.00, but I've always wanted to go back just to have it again. It was house made butter pecan ice cream served in a house made large waffle bowl with banana slices and chocolate syrup drizzled on top! It's the Bomb! It's so delicious...that you don't care if it's that large? They offer to take your picture there, so we took one...beautiful pictures, what can I say...the food is like French cuisine...very select portions, but it fills though. The service is top notch...a must recommend! It can be very romantic because of the views, being you're at the 51st floor of the Rio Suites Hotel...",

In a nutshell, it was average at best. The food was good, the service was ok, and the overall experience  didn't justify the cost. My wife and I eat out frequently and aren't afraid to pay a premium for a premium experience. Gordon Ramsey Steak is a premium experience; VooDoo Steak is an OK experience. Several Yelp reviewers were impressed that they were invited to go upstairs and check out the view from VooDoo lounge while their dinner was being prepared. We had to ask our server if this would be OK, and after we declined dessert, he was pretty much through with us, but said we could if we wanted to. Was it special? No. Was it awful? No. Would we go back? Probably not as there are too many other options in Las Vegas to be explored.",

The food was better and the prices were MUCH lower. Me and hubby shared the 32 oz Tomahawk, we brought our 2 kids with us and my daughter had the flat iron steak and my 9 year old son had the Mac and cheese side dish, they have ZERO children's menu options. The tomahawk was good but not great, same with my daughter's steak. The Mac and cheese side dish was the best thing on the table honestly. I did have the lobster bisque before dinner because they always have had this on their menu and it really is amazing! Thankfully they didnt change this recipe. Highly suggest ordering the bisque. We had the chocolate bomb dessert and that was pretty good. But the steaks and the prices they are, in my opinion are not worth it. There are many very good steakhouses in Las Vegas, this one is ok. The service however is spot on.",

    "text": "Wow, I just realized that I have never gotten around to reviewing Voodoo.  How could I have done that when Voodoo is one of our favorite steakhouses in Las Vegas, and has been since even before we moved here in 2015?  My bad!  My wife and I have been here several times, and we have never been disappointed.  At a steakhouse, I tend to go straight for the steaks - usually the rib eye or the filet.  Each of these cuts has its own bugaboo at high end steakhouses - sometimes the rib eye has too much fat and gristle in the cap, and sometimes the filet has a nice sear but the texture is a little bit mealy.  Neither or these problems has ever reared its ugly head at Voodoo.  Meanwhile, my wife tends to order seafood, and she has always raved about her meals at Voodoo.  I notice that the one recurring problem that tends to pop up in most of the negative reviews here are about the halibut being overcooked.  Neither of us has ever ordered the halibut that I recall, but there sure are plenty of other choices that are first rate.  Now that Alize has closed its doors, I think Voodoo has the best view of any restaurant in Vegas.  Not only is the view fabulous from every table, but you can also take a quick stroll out on the deck between courses and enjoy the panoramic view from there as well.  I have also been pleased with the service every time; I can't recall ever having had a problem.  The fact that the Rio is a little bit off the Strip not only contributes to the view, it also makes it easy to get here (at least if you're a local like me, and are driving).  Prices are definitely high end, but not off the charts.  And, unlike the restaurants at most Caesar's properties, the online menu here actually lists prices.  (Menus that don't list prices are a pet peeve of mine, so I appreciate that.)  So, with the great food, great view, and great location, Voodoo is a perfect place for a celebration event, or just a high end dinner.",

Two items did not come out till end of meal, like the Lobster Bisque and the 3 Shrimp Cocktail. The Halibut was dry and looked like a piece of chicken. I had better service as a walk in at a soft opening at Hell's Kitchen last week. Here, I ordered the grass fed steak at $58 medium rare. I received it and cut into it. To my eyes, it was almost well done! I requested for the waiter and showed him my steak. He tried to argue and said it was medium rare. After I had to bust out my flashlight and shined it on my meat I said, \"that's not medium rare, it's almost done!\" He then agreed, but what waiter argues with a customer? Also, a soup came out at the end of the meal to another person in the party, who serves soup after the the main course?!! Lastly, another person had to asked about her missing item that she had ordered. She was totally forgotten and embarrassed because she's the Event Planner here at the Rio. She apologizes to us, she had recommended this place. In conclusion, for a high end restaurant that is charging a high price to other comparable steak houses  in other casinos, this was a failure. Service is slow, not cooked to preference, & confrontational when questioning. It ruined my experience and any other possibility of doing business at the Rio. Voodoo Steakhouse WILL NOT be on my recommendation list. Attached is picture of first steak & the second, is the correct doneness it should of been. Photo of halibut that looked like rolled chicken breast",

It has 5 types of rum and it comes bubbling from the dry ice they put in it. Its a fun vegas size drink to take outside and enjoy the view. We sticked to appetizers which are generously portioned except for the beef Tartare which cannot be easily shared. The Fried Brie was good but i wished it was melted inside to make it easier to spread. The witch doctor seafood sampler is a lot of food with: crab cake, frog legs, hush puppies, and coconut shrimp. The coconut shrimp was the best. The frog legs were flavorless. Hush puppies great for muchin. The crab cake could use a bit more seasoning. The lobster bisque was delicious, creamy, full with flavor. The lobster bisque even came with a significant amount of lobster in it. Refills on the bisque was greatly desired. Service was exceptional and fun.",

    "text": "Had the worst experience in terms of customer service tonight. Went in with my family to have a nice dinner but literally got treated like trash.   Our server was Jose and our reservation was at 8pm. My mom ordered a rare New York steak and when the meal came, she cut it in half to see if it was cooked right. The steak looked more like a medium-medium rare. While waiting for Jose to come around, my mom took photos because despite the mistake, she appreciated the steak. When Jose finally came around, she mentioned that the steak was not rare and instead of just simply taking it to the kitchen, he said, \"Well it's been about 30 minutes already since you've had it\" first off, it wasn't 30 minutes, more like 10-15. And he was NEVER around!   So he finally agrees to take it to the kitchen, and when he brings it back, he brings the SAME steak but now it's cut up into 4 pieces basically saying that the chef insists this is RARE. Not only that, he was rude enough to say, \"I can bring you a raw steak if you'd like\" basically insulting us as customers.   And even through all this, my mom still tipped the waiter which I wish she didn't. But then again I wish we never went here at all. It's unfortunate since we stay at the Rio often but this experience was by far the worst I've had at a restaurant. On top of that, it was my aunts birthday we were celebrating and it just became the most disappointing night out in Vegas we've had.",

    "text": "*** Review is for Restaurant Week August 2104 Menu ***  I was to the VooDoo Steal restaurant about 10 years ago but hadn't been back since.  Restaurant Week gave me the impetus to go for dinner and to check out the new zip line attraction from the patio.  You have to check in on the second floor of the Rio's Masquerade Tower and then ride the glass elevator up the side of the building to the next to top floor.  The restaurant was almost empty at 5:30 when I arrived.    I was seated quickly at a window table facing the Bellagio and other south Strip properties across the freeway.  I was soon brought menus--I had to ask for the Restaurant Week menu.  I ordered an iced tea which was soon at the table and I got a nice basket of bread.  For the first course, I got the classic French onion soup.  It was a good rendition of this soup that I haven't gotten in quite some time.  For the main course, I ordered the flat iron steak extra rare.  It was a little too cooked for me but not enough to make me grimace.  The cut by nature is not the most tender steak cut but it has a lot of good flavor.  The red wine reduction added to the good beef flavor.  For dessert, I chose the assorted ice creams.  In this case, there were three dips of ice cream, pistachio, coffee, and vanilla with some fresh berries.  Service was very good.  My empty artificial sweetener packets were removed from the table as soon as a server or busser walked by.  Iced tea was refilled before my glass was empty, and plates were cleared in a timely manner.  After I ordered, my server told me to enjoy the patio and that I should feel free to take my iced tea outside with me.  This gave me a chance to take some photos and to check out that new zip line.  When I went back in, the server said he'd start my order.  This happened on my first visit years ago, and it's a nice touch especially for tourists who want to get photos of themselves with the resort corridor hotels behind them.  This was a good meal but it's not a place I'd regularly visit.  It's nice now and then for the view, but there are better values closer to home.  But we all have to be tourists in this wonderful city and this is a good way to do it!",

We were constantly out of water, had to wait for almost 40 minutes to get our drinks.  The food took almost 2 hours to get to our table from the time we first arrived. The food was good but over priced. And my boyfriend became quite ill after having the lobster on our second visit.",

The service was slow (especially in light of the fact that we went early in the evening and the place was practically empty). The atmosphere is nice and they do have a fantastic view....but the view windows were absolutely filthy....I have never seen such dirty windows in a resturant before (especially for a place in which a key feature is their view). I am not sure how these windows became so dirty (since it has to be a couple of months since the last time it rained here)....but come on guys, CLEAN THOSE WINDOWS!!!",

We then ordered our food and at 10:45 went to find the manager as we still did not have our food. It arrived shortly after. 2 of us order surf and turf ($80) and the lobster was dry and tough, and the filet was just ok.  3rd person  ordered seabass which made her sick.  4th order ribeye was good. Sights of the city was the highlight.  Service was the worst I have ever had for such a fine dining restaurant.  Will not go back.",

    "text": "We came here on a weeknight with a groupon and figured we may as well give it a shot since we were in this part of town already. The first thing to comment on is the view-- it really is gorgeous and adds to the allure and fun of dining at a place like this. If you and your significant other are both into steaks, I think this place is a great choice just on that basis alone. It offers a refreshing atmosphere that really seems to take you away from the mundane activities of daily life. But I digress..  Service is good here. The hostess didn't glare when she saw our groupon and I appreciate this seemingly small fact. The waiter had a fair understanding of the menu and offered a number of suggestions based on our preferences and experiences with previous steak houses. Cheaping out, we neglected to order an appetizer and went straight for the main course.  My girlfriend ordered a veal with pasta dish. I don't recall the name, but it was respectably good. The pasta was light and had the distinct flavor of sauteed shallots throughout it, and I am certain it was cooked with a certain amount of wine. The veal was incredibly tender--probably the softest I have ever had at a restaurant. What sets this place apart is the quality of the meat; the waiter was sure to point out how very particular this establishment is about the meat here and where they get it from.  I decided to order something from their prime section, which includes a delicious looking wagyu cut that I will have to try next time. I instead opted for a 14 oz flat iron. I rarely order flat irons simply because most restaurants don't even offer them. Only a high quality cut is worthy of being served at the fine dining level.   After much thought and internal conflict, I chose the Truffle Mac n' Cheese as my side. It was incredibly rich, and full of flavor. Not like the stuff you can get at Lucille's barbecue, as this offering had a much more distinct taste. However, it was every bit as good, if not just a bit different. You can really appreciate the different cheeses in it with each bite, but like I said it's really heavy. I wanted to finish my steak so I decided only to eat half of it and saved the rest for an enjoyable leftovers session.  The steak itself was impressive. I was not expecting to enjoy a cut like flat iron because it is categorized below rib eye and new york in terms of quality. However, because it was prime beef I really was able to enjoy its flavor and thick consistency. It doesn't have some of the same marbling that you'll get in a filet mignon but in a way it is more enjoyable and it was prepared perfectly here. I gobbled it up without difficulty.   I can't say I'll be returning here soon because I just don't have that sort of money, but suffice it to say that I'll bookmark this place as a good spot for a celebration if I am still in Vegas years down the line.",

To the contrary, our server asked us to be patient while he was slammed (we were surrounded by open tables with a 7:30 reservation).   Steak was mediocre - wife and I shared the menage a tois steak shrimp and lobster - both the seafood portions were small, chewy, and terribly under-seasoned.   Terrible ambiance and terrible value. Of all the places to get a $100 + dinner in Las Vegas - we won't be returning as neither you should venture here.",

The service was adequate but again, the overall experience was not what you would expect for the prices they charge. And I don't expect a roving photographer trying to sell me $40 photos.  If you have anywhere to be after your meal give yourself plenty of time.  It took nearly an hour to get our meal, with a mostly empty restaurant.  Overall very disappointed. Ruths Chris deserves your money way more than Voodoo Steakhouse.",

I had a solid Australian Shiraz for $13.00.  The french onion soup was VERY average.  I was actually a little disappointed in it, as it is my favorite soup.  However, my friend had the lobster bisque and it was excellent.  Get it.    I had a New York Strip from the standard side of the menu.  It was $46.00 with Rewards Card discount.  The cut was really good and thick.  I ordered it medium-rare, but it was almost medium.  The flavor and tenderness were average.    For Vegas, a steak dinner will set you back and, in some cases, rip you off.  I felt the Voodoo was just right for the price.  Above average view, with average prices and decent steaks.

I got the sea scallops, which were way over flavored, and the lobster bisque was unmemorable.  Nobody at my table raved about the food, but nobody complained either.  Food quantity was more then adequate for a \"fancy restaurant\".  Prices were too high, IMHO.  At least that meant there were no crowds even though the Rio was completely sold out for a conference.  Definitely pick up a free Total Rewards card from the casino level on your way in and you'll save a bit.  The place was very convenient for us since we were staying at the Rio.  So I'd count the meal as a success.  But I wouldn't come here as a destination.",
