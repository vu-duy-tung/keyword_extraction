    "text": "I love this place so much I absolutely hate it. First time came here after searching for authentic spicy Chinese food in Vegas I decided to try it. It took uber two rounds to find it. Who opens a restaurant in a alley at the Backdoor where all the business load and unload their trucks?!  But hey, that didn't stop them. It didn't stop me along with another million Chinese. First time I got a take just fine. Don't remember the time. After few months craving for spicy again while we are in Vegas (we don't live here but travel here a lot on business trips ),the line is NO JOKE! we three people waited for one hour. They let you sign in and give you a little ticket. And loud speaker will announce your number outside. Damn! I feel like I am in Chinese train station.  But hey, everyone sticks around, no one leaves. That tell you something huh. The third time we had two people, we waited for one hour, eventually I got little cold from the wind that night we had it to go.   With all that being said.  The food is amazing!!!!! I am Chinese who crazy about spicy food. This place is authentic and awesome. If you don't eat spicy please ask for non spicy dish. Menu has big pictures which we love. Price is just regular Vegas price. Reasonable. Service is busy and prompt. Will be back to this \"train station \" for sure!",

Try these Chengdu Taste dishes that will not only heat up your mouth but will also give you an addicting tingle from all of their authentic Szechuan ingredients.  My favorite was the Mung Bean Jelly Noodle with Chili. Don't miss the Ma Po Tofu, and if you want a meat dish to share with the table make sure to try the Toothpick Lamb with Cumin.  No beer license yet but you can bring your own, which went perfectly with the spicy delicious food. Service was good and the price is right.  We can't wait to go back on our next trip to Vegas!",

    "text": "I have been here many times and still in love! This place gives me the 'craves.' I would always crave for it's flavorful spicy dishes. If you don't know it already, Szechuan food = spicy Chinese food to be short. And guess what, I used to not being able to eat spicy food, but because I love their food so much I force myself to suck up the spiciness - now I can enjoy eating everything here (without suffering!)   My favorite dish is definitely toothpicks lamb with cumin. I can seriously have it everyday. Mung bean jelly noodle with chili sauce is also a must order appetizer. It would numb your tongue a little. One other must try is the garlic jalapeno shrimp with fries (I don't know the exact English name because it used to be off the menu.) It's full of flavor with garlic, green onions, jalapenos, potato fries, and fried shrimp with shell that you can eat it together. Rice dish I would suggest their Chengdu fried rice - it was shockingly delicious! The chef done a great job in every dish, everything was made with years of experience that we could taste it. The portions are fairly big so order accordingly. To balance everything out you can also try their plum juice. It's great for digesting and reduce the greasy (yummy) taste.  The service is pretty good for a Chinese restaurant. Our server was very patient and polite to explain the menu in details and meet our specific request. The price is very reasonable considering the big portion and quality of food. This will always be my top choice for Szechuan food in Las Vegas.",

Apologized to server that we didn't like either dish we ordered, and couldn't eat it. But they still charged us for both. If you like authentic tripe/ intestines, this was the most popular dish",

I was in line for dinner, they gave me a number and told me that there was approximately 14 people in front of me and I was told that they couldn't estimate the waiting time. I was ok with the saturation because they were very popular in the area. I decided to wait in my car since it's freezing out in winter. I park my car close enough so that I can here when they call the numbers. After almost an hour of waiting, I went back to the store to check and see if it's close to my number. They  told me that my number wasn't useful anymore because they were so busy then, so they gave out random numbers to people, and I am one of them. AND they can do anything with it anymore because I wasn't waiting outside the door when they ADJUST the number to the \"normal\" #. Do you expect me to wait in the freaking 40F for an hour just because you are popular? Didn't see any good consumer service at ALL!",

    "text": "Chengdu taste is for those who can handle the heat! If your cap is something like Tabasco, then I suggest you walk away lol.   This place is fairly small but luckily wasn't too busy. We were kindly greeted by the staff and seated promptly. The smell coming from the kitchen indicated that we were in for a spicy meal.  We ordered five dishes which included Toothpick Lamb with Cumin ($16.99), Boiled Sliced Fish in Hot Sauce ($15.99), Pork Intestines & Chicken in Earthen Pot ($17.99), Kung Pao Chicken ($13.99), and Chengdu Style Fried Rice ($10.99).   The toothpick lamb packed a punch of flavor that will have me coming back for more! Small tender bites with steamed rice was a perfect combo. (5/5  The boiled fish is for those who are up for an explosion of spice! It can be a bit intimidating once the dish is served since it looks like a red cauldron of chili oil...which it basically is. After your first bite of the melt-in-your-mouth fish, the spice sneakily intensifies and you find yourself sweating after a bite or two. For me it wasn't an unbearable spice but I noticed my tongue was tingling with this dish. (5/5)  This was my first time trying pork intestines and to me it mimicked the taste of stinky tofu. There was also chicken, potatoes, and green beans that were in the dish to accompany the strong flavor of the pork. It was a good dish but not my favorite. (3/5)  My favorite dish of the night was the kung pao chicken! Along with the toothpick lamb, this dish will be on the regular order when I come back! It was a delightful blend of chicken, chilies, ginger, and peanuts. The amount of chilies sticking to the chicken looked scary but didn't pack much heat...unless I was already desensitized from the red cauldron of fish. (5/5)  Lastly, the Chengdu fried rice was pretty average. There was egg, green onion, and shredded beef mixed in. It paired the best with the pork and chicken in the earthen pot as the other dishes were better with steamed rice. (3/5)   I can't wait to go back and try other dishes!",

Thank god I did, because ma po tofu was not edible.  Toothpick Lamb... Delicious with strong cumin flavor!! Only a couple of pieces of fatty part. You have to order this when you are here! Tell them to go low on sodium (salt) if you have high blood pressure. It was tasty but very salty.  Ma po tofu... I think they made a mistake and dumped a pound of salt in my Ma po. Since it was overly packed, I didn't say anything but I couldn't eat it. It was way too salty. Also, they put too much Sichuan pepper (). I love Sichuan peppers very much but this was too much...

At the end, we decided to give 5% tip, the worse thing was that after we declined the waiter's request to increase the tip, the waiter became angry. But that's not the end of story, guess what... They charged 15% tip by themselves after we left despite the bill which shows only 5% tip with my signature on it. MOST DISHONEST RESTAURANT I HAVE EVEN SEEN!!! DON'T THEY KNOW IT'S ILLEGAL TO CHARGE CUSTOMER WITHOUT CUSTOMER'S SIGNATURE?  PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE!",

We indulged in Couple's Sliced Beef in Chili Sauce, Cold Noodles, Boiled Fish in Green Pepper Sauce, and Boiled Beef in Hot Sauce.  Couple's Sliced Beef was excellent. The numbing sensation of the chili came through perfectly. I love cold noodles and these didn't disappoint. Out of the two \"boiled\" items, we all agreed that the green pepper sauce was much better than the hot sauce. And the soft tenderness of the fish was excellent. For authentic Chinese food, Chengdu Taste is a solid option.",

    "text": "My new go-to restaurant for spicy Chinese food, especially with company in town. Clean and bright, it offers the perfect remedy to ward off the wind chill.   Spicy Chinese food tends to calling to mind only the mouth-burning hotness, and that is a common misperception. What we generally call \"paper\" in English could be, in Chinese cuisine, one of the following:  zanthoxylum armatum, zanthoxylum bungeanum, capsicum frutescens,  capsicum annuum conoides ... to name just a few. Over thousands of years, Chinese cuisine has perfect the art of utilizing their subtle differences in color, aroma, taste, and sensation in various dishes. Due to historical reasons, this art was unfortunately lost when Chinese food brought abroad.   Thus it is really nice to see new restaurants, such as Chengdu Taste, introducing this level of sophistication to Vegas. Its menu also offers a respectable selection of non-spicy dishes. My current favorite is Sauteed Wild Yam - the main ingredient and the accompaniment, wood ear, are both mild antitoxins; besides, it provides a great contrast to a spicy dish (of which, my favorite is the Boiled Fish with Green Pepper Sauce).   Reason for taking off 1 Star: I wish the restaurant could do a better job of noise control. Patrons, especially those occupying round tables, tend to forget that no one else cares to listening on their personal business. Clearly, these people checked their breedings and etiquette at the door; the restaurant should remind them of that.",

    "text": "My parents have been raving about this place ever since they moved to Vegas, and if you're looking for some good Sichuan food, this place will definitely hit the spot!   You might want to show up early- we got here at 5:15 pm on a Friday night and we had to put our name on the list- we were 6th down but then we got in after a couple of minutes bc apparently people didn't want to share a large round table (but if you're cool with it, you'll get seated faster.)   Overall, I didn't think any of the food was overly spicy so don't worry too much- at most your mouth may be a little numb.  Boiling Fish (Shui Zhu Yu)- $15.99- 4.5/5 -a classic and cannot miss at any Sichuan restaurant! Filled with lots of bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and a really good portion of fish- seriously they did not skimp on the fish (and I was rly happy about it).  Secret Shrimp -$24.99- 5/5 I couldn't each much of this because of my allergies but my parents love this dish- crispy shrimp and fries, great flavor, and the shrimp are de-veined (I feel like most Chinese places don't do this)  Sichuan Dan Dan Noodle -$8.99 - 5/5 This was my favorite dish of all of them- the way they make it is really unique I feel- it's definitely  more peanut-y and not too spicy.  Mapo Tofu - $10.99- 4/5 this was really solid mapo tofu. It's a nice to have, doesn't feel like a must have.  Boiled Chicken with Green Pepper Sauce- $14.99- 4/5 we asked for this to be slightly les spicy and I really liked that this broth, and the chicken tasted very fresh.    Rice ($1/ bowl)  Overall, really good and service is pretty good - we got extra napkins, tea, water etc pretty fast! I recommend it!!",

    "text": "RECOMMENDED  On 12/3/16 I had an urge for Szechuan food en route to Santa Fe Station. Being already familiar with the Chinatown region of LV from a visit to Yunnan Garden a few years ago, I selected its next door neighbor based upon the Yelp reviews.They opened promptly at 11 as advertised and I was the first customer in this clean and sparely decorated restaurant, the most notable decorations being the many blown upon accolades from Los Angeles and Las Vegas publications.   A young lady brought a pot of green tea to my table. The tea here is exceptional. I really enjoyed it. Those who are unfamiliar with Szechuan and/or Northern Chinese cuisine should take the plunge here. I am familiar with those cuisines which feature great dishes like Mapo Tofu, Cumin Lamb, Fish in Chili Oil and my personal favorite, Sauteed or Twice Cooked Pork Belly with Chili Leeks.I chose the latter.  The Pork dish ($13.99) was very good, although not as good as versions I've had in Manhattan.The portion was extremely generous. The pork was nice and fatty. Szechuan Peppercorns gave the dish a pleasant heat and a nice afterburn., causing me to sweat slightly.There were plenty of Leeks in the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdish.It&s=e47d7039af45535722614c485f5183ffb8caba510e7b3512ea93d557b1699060\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">dish.It</a> came with a family size crock of white rice(which I had to request......more about that later).Fortunately, there was quite a bit of oily sauce to soak into, and make flavorful, that ample amount of rice.  While the kitchen was fast, there was no further attention paid to my table after my meal arrived, not even a simple \"how is everything?\"........and they charged me a buck for the white rice, something I have never seen done in my almost 50 years of eating Chinese food. What's with that?  Despite the foregoing minor carping, Chengdu Taste is a solid Szechuan restaurant to which I would definitely return.",

Not only is it behind the pho Kim long plaza, it's hidden behind another restaurant. Also, this place is located right next to a Yun nan restaurant which basically serves the same style of food... Well played chengdu... Trying to put that place out of business.   The place is really warm inside.. They didn't turn on the ac. Maybe it's because it's winter?  For four people, we ordered the fish boiled in spicy soup, spicy eggplant, cumin lamb, and Dan Dan noodles.   Dan Dan noodles- super good and saucy. You have to mix it really well or else all the meat and sauce stays on the bottom. It has a spicy peanuty flavor but it's not overwhelmingly hot. I love the peanut flavor and the texture of the soft thick noodles.   Cumin lamb- probably my favorite dish that I ordered. It didn't taste gamy at all. Instead amongst all the dishes that I ordered I really enjoyed the flavor of this dish the most. It's a very satisfying meat flavor.   Fish boiled in spicy soup. This dish looks pretty intimidating with all the peppers in it. But if you don't drink the soup or eat the peppers, this dish and veggies in it is super good. The fish is cod I believe. It's incredibly tender and juicy. The lady told us that the soup is drinkable. The top layer is oil but the bottom layer is broth. Becareful though because this spice tends to numb your tongue. Don't worry if this happens.. You are not dying.   Spicy eggplant- really really good. Again not too spicy where you can't eat it. Full of robust flavors. Just becareful because since it's cooked in hot oil the temperature might be really hot when you bite into it.",

After that we waited about 40 mins and they told us there are 6 tables before us and it would take more than another 40 mins for us to get the table. So that we went to the restroom in the restaurant and it took us less than 5 mins. After that they told us that our number has expired because we were not here when they called us. That's RIDICULOUS because they told us there were another 40 mins wait and we didn't leave that restaurant AT ALL during the whole time. I really think that they should learn to respect their customers.",

We had the boiled fish which had full of bean sprouts hidden below, so there was no need to order a vegetable dish which was also full of bean sprouts.   The spicy wontons were fair but could have had bigger chunks of meat for a more chewy texture. They were a little mushy.   The vegetable dish had the same flavor as the boiled fish. It could have had a slightly different flavor. A good Szechuan restaurant would have a few different flavored dishes rather than one sauce for a few dishes. Overall good but not exceptional.",

I didn't get to try enough of the menu though, so take that with a grain of salt.   The flavors were very unique and felt authentic.  We were sat along with some chinese people who were actually from that area of China, and they said it's as good as it gets in America.  They apparently visited 3 times in the 4 days they were in Vegas!   The skewers were the most interesting thing we got, although I'm hesitant to say it was the best tasting thing...  Overall, don't be scared. Try it all!   P.S. the chinese numbing  peppercorns are really strong here, I think it was my favorite part of the meal.",

I think my favorites were the Green Chile Boiled Fish, the cold garlic noodles, the boiled beef, and the Ma Po Tofu. We also tried plum juice to drink, which was unusual and smoky tasting. We spent about $25 per person, but we really ordered too much, we could have ordered two or three less entrees. Entrees ranged from 15-25, but were large sharing portions.  We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, the place was packed, and seemed to have mostly Chinese customers, which I think is a good sign for authenticity!  I'll definitely go again!",

After having a 10-day road trip in different national parks, as a Chengdu-born Chinese girl, all I was craving for is a real Chinese meal. Even if it was not Sichuan food, I would be happy at that moment. The bonus was ... I found a very authentic Sichuan restaurant when I passed by Vagas. This is not American Sichuan food, this is real and legit one. My parents (who are obviously Chengduers as well) also agreed that this restauarant did all our food right. Chengdu Taste, you make us proud!!! I ordered  (hot spicy oil fish),  (spicy mix veggie) and  (fish flavored eggplant). All of them are very well done. I love the spicy fish the most because it was so fresh and the fish almost melted in my mouth when I bite the slices. I wish I could have 4 stomachs so I could try more of their dishes. I am back to Philly now and wish they could open another chain store here in Philly. Darn... I am still thinking of the last meal I had yesterday. Soooo good!!! Btw, the service there is great too which you do not often see in Chinese restaurants in US.",

Worst service ever. Definitely not recommend. I am sure there are better places for Chinese food in Vegas.",

It's definitely one of the spicier and oilier ones but super flavorful), boiled fish with green chili sauce (this one is a famous one, but I thought it was just ok. I don't think I'd get it again).

Obviously they brought their Cali standard over to Vegas, which is really wise, considering there were not many legitimate Szechuan food restaurants in Vegas before. I came to Vegas almost a year ago and they were not opened at that time. Obviously they gathered quite a lot of popularity in less than a year.   If I am visiting Vegas again, I'll definitely come back.",

Next came the toothpick lamb again awesome flavors and the least spicy of everything tonight.  Then came the Dan Dan noodles (if I remember right) and the spicy wonton.  Can't say anything was too spicy to eat, but some had some kick, best part is there is more flavor than heat in all of these dishes.  Looking to go back and try some more from this place.",

So it's like you spent the money buying their food but you leave with feeling like you ate a fly in your stomach. As a foodie, I have been to and experienced so many restaurants and have to say this is a DISGUSTING EXPERIENCE.   1, At first, we, a group of 5 people went in and asked for the empty round table right there at the corner. For some reason, They just would not accommodate us and arranged a table of 4.  So we asked if they would put the two small tables together to make a bigger one and they said NO for no apparent reason!  2. Then when the order came, they forgot to write 2 dishes we asked for!  3. The whole time the Serve had no smiles! Like the customer owe him a million dollars!  4. Okay that's not all, the funniest thing is with this kind service, i try to understand that nobody is easy, so ended up paying him $10 dollar tip(though with his service we should have paid NO tip at all because it was such an upset experience). I was shocked he ended up walking to me and start confront me why I am paying him only $10 bucks! :-O   RIGHT IN MY FACE HE ASKED THAT QUESTION!!! Can you believe that?! Oh! And his name was.. errr David or something....   Wow NEVER EVER coming back again!",

It goes without saying it may be hard to have the best experience here if you bring friends who don't enjoy spice or heat.  Their specialties like the toothpick lamb and guess guess shrimp are the way to go- menu is large and most of what I've had is good, but the standout dishes are noteworthy because they can't be found elsewhere in town.

Ordered the Beef with Crispy Rice because I had never seen that on a menu before. I rarely order beef because I hate gristly chewy pieces, but in this large bowl there was only one piece like that. I was expecting the rice to be like on the bottom of a proper bibimbop bowl, but I'm pretty sure they took their day old, pressed it out in a baking sheet, then dried it overnight, and the either wok or deep fried it - puffed rice chunks. Really good - the crunchy rice with the meat, the not spicy rice with the fiery beef.   Two different servers asked if I wanted a bowl of rice which I didn't understand since it was a rice dish but I finally said yes and I'm glad I did just to temper the heat.   The next night I met a friend from China and when she heard I ate at Chengdu she said that it was extremely authentic and always packed with Chinese customers. My only regret is that I ate alone...clearly a place to bring a small group so you can order a whole bunch of dishes to share.",

    "text": "09/05/18 LUNCH  In 1978 I dined at the Panda Inn, in Pasadena California. That was the very first time I had ever tried Szechwan cuisine. Already loving spicy food as served in other cuisines, this was a revelation. I immediately took my parents there, and they flipped out. Then in 1979 I took my boyfriend, now partner and husband of 38+ years, and he loved it. And I have loved Szechwan ever since. And living in LA until 2010 we were lucky enough to have even better versions of Szechwan, particularly in nearby San Gabriel Valley.  When Chengdu Taste opened a branch here in Las Vegas, almost 3 years ago, there was much written about it, how fantastic it was. And over the years we would drive by the outside every once in a while to see if we could get in. But every time we tried there was a mob waiting outside for a table. We had no idea how small the place was until this meal, it's definitely one of the smallest restaurants I've encountered in Las Vegas. And so Chengdu Taste remained on my \"to do\" list, up until this visit.  So when a friend proposed we try to go there, perhaps for an early lunch, I jumped at the chance. We got there on a Wednesday just after 11am, just after they opened. We were the second table to be seated.  The server was gracious and attentive. We ordered a lot of food. The spice level was fine, we stated we could handle a \"9 or 10\" but it ended up more like a \"6 or 7\", but that didn't bother us, it had enough heat. The amount of Szechwan peppercorn used varied from dish to dish, which was great, we love that stuff. The flavors were there as well. And in all I would say there was 1 outstanding dish, 3 quite good dishes, and 1 mediocre dish. So normally I would want to return and try other dishes.  But sadly, I cannot.  Because every single dish was far too salty. The use of salt varied from a lot to absolutely extreme. Nothing less. And the salt level amplified even further once we brought leftovers out of our refrigerator for the next day's meal.  The experience saddened and frustrated us.  So we won't go back. There are other purveyors of Szechwan in Las Vegas.  But if you find yourself dining there, you should probably ask them to cut down on their use of salt. And order one dish at a time, so you can stop ordering before you are committed to more dishes coming from the kitchen.",

Hidden in the center of a massive plaza in Chinatown this is one of the best places to enjoy Sichuan cuisine known for heavy use of chiles and sichuan peppercorns.  We opted for the Sichuan Fried rice chock full of wood ear mushroom, sliced meats, and a dash of vinegar. Different than what you're used to seeing in Chinese restaurants but 100 times more delicious.   The star of the show was the Mapo Tofu. Soft tofu bathed in a small ocean of fiery chile and peppercorns and minced porkn that it's absolutely addictive over rice.  You need a vegetable to balance it out so we ordered a bok choy dish that was in a savory sauce. Even the veggies are flavorful.  Note: Seating here is limited so dont be shy to ask for a table. You will have to be bold and flag down the busy waitresses. This is just part of the dining experience.  I wouldn't come in with a big group. Four is a crowd.  I will be back to try the sliced spicy fish!!",

But what they lack in size, they make up in flavor.   We ordered the spicy hot pot with white fish. The tiny peppercorn like balls in the soup is Szechuan Pepper aka Sichuan Peppercorn aka Chinese Coriander. These little guys add all that flavor to the soup. You don't have to eat them, but if you do, your mouth will tingle. It seems to numb your mouth a bit, but without it you don't get the signature Chengdu hot pot Taste. The white fish in the soup was tender and flaky and buttery. The soy bean sprouts in the soup added a contrast to the pepper, providing a well-balanced bite.   If you want to be adventurous, you absolutely can with options like mung bean jelly, kidneys, and intestines or you can order plain old noodles.   Tan Tan Noodles. Not so plain after all. I have no idea what's in it or what that brown sauce is. There were some scallions I recognized in the garnish. Mix well and try to share! The noodles were perfectly cooked, al dente. The sauce...perfection. It's simplicity allows you to savor this dish. I could eat this everyday!   The last dish was the Kung Pao Shrimp. Soooo good. Shrimp was very lightly battered and had a crisp bite to it. Peanuts, chilies, and the sauce were amazing.   Too bad they don't have an alcohol license. A nice brew with the spicy food would have been great, but the tea is sufficient. Always get a pot of tea with whatever you order.   Also, the restaurant is a bit hard to find. You must use your GPS. Restaurant is settled on the backside of the main Chinatown strip mall. It seems like an alleyway. I believe the owners of the strip mall are renovating the alleyways to make room for more shops.   There is a recovering alcoholics club across the lot that is open 24/7 and always seems to have a ton of people congregating around the same time Chengdu Taste is busiest, as well, so parking may be an issue.",

The restaurant is small but they do take reservations which makes me so happy. They get very busy on weekends so if you plan accordingly you won't have a long wait for a table at all.   All the dishes I've tried have been great and I'm slowly getting through the entire menu. Slowly because I end up ordering a few key dishes on each visit that are musts. The cumin lamb, guess guess shrimp, tan tan noodles, Chongqing chicken and garlic pork. Everything else is great and come in varying degrees of spice level so be forewarned. I've discovered a new favorite dish that I'll be ordering regularly as well. The stir fried intestines are delicious and have a great crunchiness that adds an interesting texture.  I'm not usually a big fan of super spicy food but the flavors here are sometimes subtle and the spice is more of a heat than an all out taste bud attack of fire.   Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in town, I am a regular at this point.",

Items ordered:  Red chili chicken skewer Pork with garlic sauce Beef with crispy rice crust Guess Guess shrimp Sauteed wild yam Toothpick lamb with cumin Suteed eggplant Dip fried chicken cube Tan Tan Noodles Dry stir fried pigs intestine Rice  The tastes of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province famous for its spicy food with lots of chilis, is well represented with this restaurant in Chinatown.  We divided the items we wanted into two groups of 5 dishes and had the meal courses in those two groups.  The milder dishes came first with the red chilis being very evident in the second 5 dishes which rounded out the meal.  Note that the menu says red chili chicken skewer, but it has more than chicken.  There are chicken feet, lotus, fungus, and chicken gizzards in a cold broth.  Very good.  The Guess Guess shrimp was an absolute winner!  Shrimp eaten with shells on sitting on top of a mound of French fries.  Who would have thought?  It is so good!  The toothpick lamb with cumin was good as was the beef with crispy rice crust.  One of the standout dishes was the dry stir fried pig intestine.  So good.    This is a place where a dish is enough for two people to share so it's best if you go here with a number of people to share and try more dishes.  Service was very good with plenty of refills of our water jugs and the way that they divided the meal into the two major courses and asked before beginning the second half.  Since our conductor had written down the dishes, it was easier to order and to have it coursed.",

Since outside is too cold to stay over an hour so I decided to sit in my car to listen to the numbers to be called. I can hear the number clearly by their bluetooth audio, after been 60 mins I heard they called #66 so I get off my car and stand by in front of the door (my number was 70).    After been a while, they called #67 through the audio and the server came out called #73 by his voice at the same time. I was so confused and tried to figure out what's going on, I showed my ticket to the server and he checked waiting list on iPad and said to me that he called my number 10 mins ago. I was stunned there and I said I didn't heard my number from Audio. He said, he called by his voice, and since I missed my number I can't get in. The ridiculous thing is that they never remind me that server will call the numbers, too so just stand by in front of the door. I can't understand how they could call two different numbers by audio and a server himself. It was so ridiculous that I waited over an hour and can't dine in because I missed my number, and the server gave me the attitude and says it's all your fault! I never seen restaurant call numbers by two different ways and calls different number at same time!!",

I don't eat lamb but my family liked it. The chicken skewers in chilly oil could have been cooked a little longer. Portions are HUGE. Small place and few tables so be prepared to wait. Service could be better. If you have a lot of leftovers, I'd suggest you ask for the containers and pack them yourself. The containers they provide are small and would not fit all the broth so the staff will pack only the ingredients and discard most of the broth. Pack yourself and you can take every drop of broth home. Overall, it was an experience. I would probably go back again (not as enthusiastic) but will order dishes that are more familiar.",

Originally opened in the San Gabriel Valley around 2013, and written about by Jonathan Gold with verbiage that has read like an ode to Chengdu-style cooking ever since, it was over a year ago that the family-owned affair began to expand its reach outside California and with locations now in both Nevada and Hawaii the mini-chain has shown no signs of slowing down, though a look at the current menu does show some adaptation to the local palate.  Famed for its heavy use of all-things pepper, the taste of Chiles in many forms ubiquitous in all but a few dishes where the sweetness of Bell Peppers are better suited, those entering Chengdu taste will find the setting familiar with a tight kitchen offset to the left of entry while the dining room spreads outward, accolades and a few decorations on the wall plus seating for perhaps a hundred available with a menu containing a near-equal number of items.  Considered one of the lightest styles of Chinese cooking, the lack of starchy carbohydrates as the base of most dishes seeing many items served with Sauce or Broth, it was with several items already in mind that an order of ten items was written in pen on a guest check and divided into two rounds, the sever at first interpreting this as the group wanting some now and the rest to-go, but quickly understanding the intent and doing a beautiful job of making sure that Water as well as Tea were always full and that the table was never over-burdened.  Trying best to place 'milder' dishes first, the vivid aromatics of Sichuan peppercorn first perfuming the air and later causing its characteristic numbing effect while Chili Oil is restrained in favor of dried or fresh Chiles, an opening bowl described as \"Red Chili Chicken Skewer\" was soon presented as a chilled dish with several skewers emerging from intimidating red murkiness, the rubber band's removal liberating everything from Black Fungus and Wild Yam to Feet and Gizzards, a veritable 'choose your own adventure' dish that was well received and quick to leave lips tingling in anticipation of what was to come.  Consuming a lot of water throughout the evening, others packing in mountains of White Rice to quell the heat, both the thinly sliced Pork with Garlic Sauce and bowl of Peppercorn-laden Tan Tan Noodles were portioned far smaller than other plates and generally not as interesting in terms of their concept compared to other local places, the Beef with Crispy Rice Crust and \"Guess Guess Shrimp\" taking a completely opposite slant by offering enough to feed at least two with the starch provided by what was best described as \"savory Rice Krispie Treats\" and Wok-tossed French Fries, respectively.  Rounding out the opening act with slippery Wild Yam on a large plate with tender Black Fungus and crisp Bell Peppers, course two first featured the aforementioned Noodles and Toothpick Lamb with Cumin, the later quite frankly looking like something straight out of horror film and completely saturating the air within seconds, but in reality a beautiful plate of gamey Meat that is boldly accented and perfectly tender with built-in finger food convenience.  Passing on the Pork Intestines next door, but this time finding the group more agreeable to taking a chance, Chengdu Taste's Offal comes in several varieties including hot pots, stone bowls and stir fry, the later rendering previously the previously dehydrated guts crisp on the outside but tender within amidst both Bell Peppers and Dried Chiles while the Sauteed Eggplant comes in a deep bowl filled with Sauce that is one part sweet and one part warming, the \"Dip Fried Chicken Cube\" offered bone-in or deboned essentially Chongqing Spicy Chicken that is not quite as crisp as the one next door, but still very worthwhile thanks to both the juiciness of the bird and a substantial amount of smokiness.  ****A bit more pricey than Yunnan Garden, but at the same time also featuring better service, Chengdu Taste has a lot to offer in terms of menu variety, the best bet being to gather up a large group of adventurous diners and order based on whatever sounds best with relative assurance that all of it will be spicy, but not the sort of spice that will have you up all night in gastrointestinal distress.",

We ordered the spicy beef noodle soup. As expected, spicy. We enjoyed the fresh tasting noodles and rich broth. I wish tendons were included for my personal preference. We also tried the volcano sliced fish over hot stones, which, needless to say, was also very spicy, partly due to the tongue numbing Sichuan peppercorn used in the stew. It was good but also a rich dish.",

    "text": "Talk about lighting a fire in your stomach or if spicy is not your thing Chengdu Taste might not be the best idea. I love all foods. Chengdu Taste is one spot that might say it lot but one that truly been looking forward too. All the hype about the restaurant in CA and then friends that have gone nothing but rave reviews. The whole Szechuan style is one not that familiar with but one that can appreciate and became huge fan. Not often give five stars but really worthy of all the hype and the food is flat out amazing!!!   Thankfully had my old roommate in town visiting so got to try a few dishes on my first visit. The menu is HUGE. It more like novel with pages and pages plus lots of pictures. Really most part almost every item has picture or least each section or cooking technique has a picture of one item.  The one pic seen on social network lot or one that got my attention was the toothpick lamb. Not sure about Szechuan style but dam that toothpick lamb looks amazing. It was so LEGIT. It really was so addicting that when get that one little bit of money. You just want more and more and more. It this little sliver of lamb on toothpick (lot of toothpicks) has the most incredible deep of flavor and every piece cooked to perfection. Lamb pick the heat might not hit your right off the back but once get the ball rolling pop three or four in row. You feel the burn!!! The same feeling with the Tan Tan Noodles. Thankfully our server caught us doing it injustice. It was both of our first time. We just taking the noodles before actually giving it good mix working the sauce on the bottom throughout the whole dish. So FYI if get the noodles make sure mix it around before dig in. Tan Tan Noodles really only noodles with the sauce. Simplicity. Nothing jazzed but just great noodles and sauce. So So So good! The third dish we order was Spicy Boiled Fish. I wanted to try something in hot pot. That section alone has a really nice diversity. Different proteins to vegetarian style. The Spicy Boiled Fish was again another amazing dish. The white fish was cooked to perfection nice and moist, hearty not only fish in the pot vegetables from cabbage other stuff, and really next visit if just me Hot Pot is more then enough food for one. Just when you think put dent into it there more! We were going order fourth dish. Thankful our waitress was going over our order and made recommendation that maybe skip the last one if need the order it. Three items for two guys was spot on the right amount of food.   The service was awesome. The place was busy that night we had short wait before got seated. They were still on it. I did appreciate the fact our waitress thought we order to much food.   The restaurant definitely got vibe all its own. My first impression was it more like office building then restaurant restaurant. It just one open area with tables and chairs. Not very big place so if place get packed expect wait. Talk about hole in the wall location. Yes it around Chinatown but so off the side road you can easily pass it. The street address hell of confusing because the road is more like pulling in parking lot of building that the restaurant located in. Once pull into the parking lot still little way but just look for the sign outside the building. It definitely falls in the hidden gems for me. I am just happy that finally got me some Chengdu Taste. No doubt plan on getting my heat on again. So much more good stuff on the menu one visit not enough.",

    "text": "Found this delicious locale on Yelp one night after discovering my favorite Chinese restaurant was closed temporarily for vacation.  Oddly enough, Chengdu Taste is located right next to a Hunnan style restaurant (both being spicy style food).  I knew we were in for a treat though because the Hunnan restaurant had one table seated and for Chengdu Taste it was a 40 minute wait and the restaurant was packed.  If my experience is consistent, expect to wait if you go.  Not having been here before, I ordered what seemed to be the most popular dishes on Yelp.  The Chili Wontons were phenomenal and arrived to the table rather quickly. Other than that, we had the Fish in Green Chile Sauce which was hot both temperature wise and spice wise, but needed a little extra flavor other than just straight heat.  We had the String Beans which were great but were also consistent with the style of food and what you would expect.  We had the beef noodle soup, flavor and level of spice were not on point and the serving was outrageous.  Had the String Pork with Chile Sauce and was alright but had a lot of vinegar.  Make sure you order white or fried rice with this dish to absorb some of the heat and flavor.  Finally, we had the Dan Dan Noodles which by themselves, is worth the trip and wait.  I am so conflicted between Chengdu Taste and Yunnan Tasty Garden for who had the best Dan Dan Noodles in town.  Both are great and worth the wait.",

It's not easy to try a new spot when I travel with my little family since they already have their minds set on where they want to go before we even get there.  This trip was a little different since some of the places that they used to like has been written off as not returning there again so we were able to try out this spot.  Thank goodness!  We showed up around 1:30 on a Monday afternoon for lunch.  The wait was around 20-25 minutes for a table for five, which wasn't too bad.  We ordered quite a few things to share and we were happy with the majority of our orders.  Cumin lamb on a toothpick: very flavorful!  Dry fried pork intestines: surprisingly good!  The kids loved it!  Dry fried string beans: good  Mapo tofu: I didn't get to try it because I'm not a big fan, but the boys seemed to like it.  Boiled fish fillet in fresh chili: good, but hard to eat because there was too much of the Chinese peppercorn, which caused our tongues to go numb.  Couldn't finish so we ended up tossing about 50% of it.  I'd definitely come back and I noticed they have a few other locations in SoCal and Hawaii.",

Arrived about 6:30 pm and waited about 30 minutes.  Service was very fast and definitely adequate, we received a carafe of water and pot of hot tea which was all we really needed.  The food was outstanding. I was a little nervous it would be dangerously spicy after looking at some of the reviews but it was spot on!  My nose ran a little which for me is a good thing when eating Sichuan.   Everything is highly seasoned and perfectly flavorful.    The menu is extensive and includes pictures (helpful). We had the jelly noodle appetizer, toothpick lamb, tan tan noodles and special fried rice.   This was a lot of food for two people but we never mind leftovers.  In fact, I got up early this morning to eat them before my husband woke up!  The place is loud (in a good way).  We had a large boisterous party of about 12 next to us but as soon as the food came they got very quiet.   I'm planning my next visit already.",

    "text": "This is probably one of the best Schezuan restaurants in Las Vegas or America??  I'm unfortunately not able to share what it's like in the motherland. One can only wish...  Wonton in chili oil- 4.5 stars. I love spicy food and usually order this because of the combination of wontons with a tad of spice. This is the least spiciest version I've had; however, dare I say that this was one of the best wontons I have ever had. The meat filling is legit-- it's packed  and has amazing flavors. I was able to taste the marinade inside the filling and it was juicy, too! The wonton skin was also perfectly cooked--not too soggy.   Boiled fish with green pepper sauce- 4 stars.  I guess it's Jonathan Gold approved. But Mr. Gold and I don't always agree (ahem, Lotus of Siam) so I was just chillin' wondering if we'd be on the same page this time. I have grown to love the spicy dishes with peppercorn, but usually have ordered it in the reddish sauce at other restaurants. This broth is so clear and delicious looking, but it turns out I saw the article in time, and the broth is not meant to be eaten. The fish was cooked perfectly, but I personally prefer this dish with other types of meats and also in the red sauce/stew. It also isn't too spicy IMHO until you eat a peppercorn. Then good luck. You better make sure that water is on its way.   Chicken in garlic sauce- 4.5 stars. My first, best and most fave version was in Paris. Yeah, so strange, but this dish is the closest to the one I had. The chicken is cooked perfectly and the flavor was ON POINT. The best in Vegas so far. FYI it's a cold dish.   Toothpick Cumin lamb- 5 stars. My favorite dish of the night. The lamb chunks are nice sized meats, it was cooked to perfection and the flavor is amazing. I highly recommend it!!!!!   Price is competitive with other Schezuan restaurants. Service was on point, and I will definitely be back to try more. I saw an earlier review on cash only...they take CC FYI.",

The type where you want to go back to the restaurant again to re-order the same thing? Chengdu did it to me! I find it mildly ironic that it's the one 4 hours away in Vegas, rather than the one that's closer (depending on traffic, I suppose! lol!) in the SGV.    We went for lunch and had no wait time, though almost all the tables were full at one point.  Unlike some other reviewers, we experienced good service.  It was super informal and nothing mind-blowing, but we expected rudeness and inattentiveness, based on what some people experienced.    We enjoyed the Ma Po Tofu, though I thought it would be better, based on raves.  Love the tongue-numbing sensation!!  The Toothpick Lamb with Cumin was also good.  For me, the start of the show was the Mung Bean Jelly Noodle with Chili! OMG, I can (and would like to) eat this everyday!) Now I'm on a search to find more versions of this dish a bit closer to home.    As of late November, they don't have their liquor license yet, so feel free to BYOB.  Cold beer goes nicely with much of the food.  They just brought us two extra plastic cups with no worries!  We'll be back in Vegas for New Years and I know at least one place we're going!!!",

    "text": "I almost didn't come here to eat tonight, because I am not into eating really spicy food. But I was visiting my friend's store and mutual friends dropped by for a visit and invited us to try this popular Chinese restaurant from Alhambra, CA. that just opened up in Chinatown.  While walking over here, we were even discussing why this particular spot have host quite a few failed restaurants in the past few years, in spite the fact that the restaurant next door always seems to be busy.  We arrived right after 5pm, and there was already a crowd standing, presumably waiting for an open table. The restaurant is sparsely decorated, there are Chinese opera masks acting as ornamental points of interests on the otherwise unremarkable interior walls of the establishment.  But I don't think anyone really paid attention them.  After glancing through the menu, our party had picked two appetizer portioned items immediately, while debating on which entree items to ordered. In the end we opted for the following:  1. Pork with Garlic Sauce   89. Wonton with Red Chili Sauce   22. Boiled Fish with Green Pepper Sauce   56. Toothpick Lamb with Cumin   The first two items are a must!  I can literally order that and be able to down 2-4 bowls of rice with these Chinese comfort food. The sauce is the secret trump card of nearly divine deliciousness (sadly it is not vegetarian friendly. But that does not affect me.) The pork is sliced thin and cooked by a chef that have obviously perfected the dishes. The wonton is good, but their version of the Red Chili Sauce is superb!!! Major nom nom time as soon as the servers dropped off these two dishes!!!  The Toothpick Lamb with Cumin is decent, but it pale in comparison to #1 and #89.   The Boiled Fish with Green Pepper Sauce  is listed as being spicy, but it has a nice flavor and was not overwhelmingly spicy (we asked them to not make it too spicy), and it was a great recommendation from our waiter.  Overall, for a place that has probably not been opened for more than a few days in Las Vegas, I can already predict that it will be a major success story. The food is good to \"shut up and take my money\" good.  Servers are busy with the number of tables they have to wait on, but they did an admirable job of it.  Menu price is higher than expected, but with the superior execution of the dish it can easily be justified.  Plus the whole time we dine here, it is clear that the restaurant is packed only with super informed Asians (mainly Chinese) patrons, a major indicator of superiorness.   I highly recommend that you all come and check them out, but preferably after I am sick of dining here (after about two month) or after I am already seated at our table and waiting for our food.  So keep it on the DL. Only share this wonderful recommendation with your dearest friend or the one you intend to marry. Otherwise everyone will have an hour wait just like the people visiting their Alhambra and Rosemead locations.  So hush x4.",

    "text": "Looking back at my weekend in Vegas, this was probably one of the best meals if not the best. My family and I got there at 11am and we were seated at the last open table, one of the larger ones in the center. We noticed that some smaller parties (of 2 or 3) had to share the other large tables. We were lucky that no other small parties came in while we were eating, so we had the entire table to ourselves.  We ordered the Pork with Garlic sauce (), Water Boiled Meat and Fish (), Mapo Tofu (), Tan Tan Noodles (), and Spicy Chicken (). For all dishes, we could adjust the spice level, so I liked that as someone who generally can't eat too spicy. Everything was authentic, and our family of four actually finished all five dishes. I would say my favorite dish was probably the Pork with Garlic Sauce, followed by the Spicy Chicken. The chicken had a lot of bones to work through, but the flavor was totally on point.  Service was just okay. I think I was dying of sweat and tears halfway through our meal, but it took a while for the server to come and ask if we wanted more tea or some iced water. However, given how delicious the food was, I wish I had come back here a second time before returning to California. Will definitely recommend this place to my friends back home!",

The tan tan noodle dish was incredibly flavorful, showcasing notes of subtle bean paste, chili oil, and other magical Chinese ingredients! The chicken won ton soup was soothing (total hangover cure) and delicious, and the ma po tofu was the perfect texture and the sauce had just the right amount of spice. The highlight of the meal was the boiled fish with pickled cabbage - wow! Definitely do not bypass this showstopper. It's not really pointed out as a special item on any of their materials, but it was by far our favorite dish. The broth had a wonderful tangy flavor with a unique burst of spice, and the fish was super tender. We thoroughly enjoyed this meal and could not recommend Chengdu Taste more!

    "text": "This review is more of a rant about the poor customer service. This is a common theme in Las Vegas, the good Chinese restaurants have great tasting and authentic Chinese food, but their service is atrocious. When I'm here there's always a wait; anywhere from 15-45 min. I usually grab the chicken skewers in red chili (best Chinese skewers ever!), the stir fry potatoes (probably best in Vegas) and the boiled fish in red oil (it has a very nice numbing effect after eating it). Once again, the food is exceptional in the sense that it is authentic, they make it the correct way and in terms of Chinese food, the top Northern Chinese cuisine in Vegas. But the service is severely lacking. For example: when it comes to seating, please ask your guests before assuming they will share a table 2.) please refill water, utensils and napkins when appropriate. And 3.) don't wait until the end to give me a smile; at that point you're cheating labor.",

Don't let the deep red colors of the chili oil or the endless amount of peppers in their dishes scare you. It's actually not that spicy.   The only uncomfortable sensation you might have is that the Sichuan peppers make your mouth numb. If you ever have an appointment with your dentist for a root canal and you're scared of receiving shots, just anesthetize your mouth beforehand by eating their spicy lamb cumin, which is one of their must-try items. Another one of my favorite dishes is their spicy boiled fish. Again, it's not that spicy, but it is jam packed with flavor and flooded with a pool of chili oil. So tasty though! I also got to try their kung pao shrimp, kung pao chicken, hot and spicy pork belly, and sauteed beef with crispy rice recently, and they were all really good!   If you're ever craving that Szechuan, Chengdu is thee spot to go.",

I loved this place and will definitely be back.   This did NOT bother me but to set your expectations for this place:  - It's in a warehouse sort of district. Not in a strip mall or anything like that.  - The restaurant is SMALL and has no waiting area if you need to wait for a table or wait for takeout.  - There's a lot of noise since it's a busy kitchen and there's a lot of folks in and out.  - Since the restaurant is so small the employees are fairly strict about keeping the door open only for reasonable amounts of time in order to preserve the experience for the guests and the heating/AC bill. If it's absolutely freezing or sweltering outside obviously don't sit there and hold the door open letting all the AC or heat out of the small restaurant.   Come here if you want to experience AMAZING Chinese food but do not come expecting an \"experience\" or \"quiet family dinner\".",

On future visits, I plan on bringing a portable fan, wearing a headband and they seem OK with the whole \"no sleeves, yes service\" so I might do that too.  The \"Toothpick Lamb with Cumin\" has a reputation that precedes it and was still better than expected. Those juicy, flavorful pieces were a great opener to the chili pepper spice bonanza that ensued like with their amazing \"Mapo Tofu\" to the \"Fish filet with green pepper\" and its deeply comforting broth.   The real surprise was their \"Dry Stir Fried Pig's Intestines\".  Much like new Taylor Swift, listening to hockey on the radio or Jay Cutler's face, intestine is something I've never enjoyed....until now! The crispy texture was key along with the killer seasoning.   Truly, the only pig intestine entree I would ever voluntarily order.   It was about halfway through dinner when my forehead did its best impression of Niagara Falls and went from dry to drenched in half a second. The guy seated next to me was literally red in the face!  But stopping was not an option as I felt kind of possessed to carry on since everything was so damn delicious.  If I had to knock the place:   - They definitely need Lazy Susans.  It would have totally made dinner way more convenient.   - Don't expect great service, not a big deal for me - The diced rabbit dish had all the bones going on, which didn't make it enjoyable, and went barely touched. - Have cold packs ready to shove down my shirt midway through the meal?",

    "text": "Chengdu Taste is a casual Szechuan joint in China Town.  If you enjoy spicy food, read on...if you don't enjoy spicy food you can still read on if you like...=)  Service:  It's a very small restaurant that holds a maximum of about 80 patrons.  Service has been very good for a small capacity high volume restaurant. The food comes out quickly and although you may have to wave them down to get more rice or the water jug refilled, they take care of it immediately.  Food:  Great, great great Szechuan food. The spiciness kind of numbs the tongue, but it doesn't linger like thai food.  A glass of water cleanses your pallet and you're right back in the mix.  Portions are family style, so come hungry or fatty up like me.  My  favorites include: Toothpick Lamb:  Spicy, tasty, flavorful and I've never had anything like it.   Dried Pork Intestines: Flavor and spiciness combo is fantastic, this might be my favorite dish. Twice Cooked Pork: If a dried pork dish isn't your thing, then go with this and all is good. Dan Dan Noodles: If you're feeling noodles, give these a try and enjoy yourself.  Value:  Most dishes are in the mid teen price range but you get a lot of food.  Coming here hungry or with a group of your favorite foodie friends (as I do) is the best way to maximize your experience.  The quality you get for the price is amazing.  Ambiance: Super casual mom and pop feel with open seating. The dining area has 4 large round tables to accommodate larger parties of 8+ and the remaining tables seat 4.   Timing is everything in getting a table but the staff is focused on turning tables over quickly by getting the food out asap.   Chengdu Taste that delivers high quality Szechuan food for a very reasonable price.  It's places like this that is making Vegas a great foodie city and is putting lots of pressure on the high end Chinese restaurants.  After my first visit, I was back 2 days later and had just as good a time as the first.  There's lots of dishes to try and they're all exceeding expectations.  Good times =)",

I would eat this every day. There was something vaguely Italian about the umami flavors present.   The boiled fish with green pepper was great too. The fish was nicely cooked and had a good flavor. The broth was excellent. Nothing was crazy spicy, and the peppercorns were abundant, causing that wonderfully unique numbing sensation. We felt satisfied and surprisingly energized when we were finished.   Definitely recommended, and will be sharing with friends so we can go back and try more.",

They asked me if I minded sharing a table with another Asian man already seated and I accepted.  I introduced myself and found out the man I was sharing a table with was here on business from Reno and he had found the place on Yelp.  He had ordered the Pig Chitterlings in casserole (which he said he had never had before but wanted to try) and I ordered the  Shrimp Kung Pao.  I was brought a pot of hot tea and our orders came out in a timely matter.  I had never eaten the Pig Chitterlings and was offered some of his order.  I tried it and was surprised how good  it was.  My Kung Pao Shrimp was good and I shared some in return.  Both dishes came with steamed rice and I would order either dish again.  People were arriving as quickly as they were leaving and the place remained packed all the while I was there.  The restaurant is a little hard to find as it's located behind the China Town complex off of Spring Mountain Rd. but is easily accessed from going south on Valley View and turning west on Vanessa Dr. or Shiff Dr. I would recommend this place as it seems to have authentic dishes and a well informed customers.

By the clientele we observed as we walked in (native Chinese), we knew this was going to be the 'real deal,' and it was!  Extensive menu with many things we'd never heard of before.  The beef appetizer was the best Chinese dish I'd ever tasted.  Portions really are enough for two, so order sparsely.  The Hot Pork soup was a meal in itself.   Service was prompt and friendly.

We went on a Thursday night and it started out pretty empty and was completely packed by the time we left.  Like most small restaurants, there isn't a place for people to stand and wait for tables, so when 3 large groups came in to wait to be seated, they just loitered by all of the tables where people were already eating -- creating a loud and somewhat awkward experience for those up us still eating.  Service was slow.  We had to ask several times for napkins, forks, and our check.  Overall the food was just okay.    The fried rice was incredible.  Unlike any other fried rice I've ever had before -- that alone gives this place it's rating for me.    Otherwise we ordered the toothpick lamb -- which in our case consisted of a lot of fat-- a pea and pork dish (which was really a soup?  It was a bunch of peas, and ground pork in some sort of liquid with absolutely no flavor at all), and finally the wontons in chili oil -- which were very good and very spicy.  I am rating this 3 stars because (aside from the fried rice) I didn't think the food was amazing, and I wasn't blown away by the service.  I don't know if I will be returning here.",

    "text": "Chengdu Taste has been forefront on my radar ever since I got a note from a friend saying it very easily could have been the best Sichuan meal he has had in a very long time.    Let me start with what I perceived as the only con of the meal which is atmosphere. There is none. The room is fairly sterile and chaotic. Not in a bad way chaotic but rather waiters constantly buzzing tables and the endless procession of people trying to secure tables (when we left there were easily 10 people inside the restaurant and an additional 20-30 outside). I did not count the amount of tables inside the restaurant but my guess is close to 8 four tops and a smattering (3-ish) of 6/8 tops.  We were originally suppose to be a gathering of 8 people but as does happen in Vegas, three of the eight opted out last minute. I will try and minimize the blow by blow details of each bite and list the dishes we had.  Wonton in spicy chili oil. One of the best I have had anywhere. Perfect balance of sweet spicy tingly goodness. Originally 1 ordered and so good we ordered another.  Mung bean jelly in chili oil (chilled). I have never had nor have wanted to have mung bean jelly. That has now changed going forward. This was a delightful dish with the mung bean jelly like soft strands of udon noodles. I am certainly not a veteran of this dish but those that are considered this to be an excellent version.  Sliced beef and tripe salad (chilled) in chili oil. Again, excellent. I have had only one better and it is the one at Nan Xiang in Flushing. I will say that the Nan Xiang version is more of a sledge hammer of flavors while CTs version is very well balanced and nuanced.  Cumin lamb on tooth picks. I think this is CTs signature dish, and rightfully so. Perfectly spiced, cooked too perfection little bites of lamb shoulder. Like the wontons, these were so good another round was ordered.  Braised fish and silky tofu in chili oil. This was ordered because the green chili oil version was not available this evening (along with the duck tongue). This was a good dish with good spice levels and flavors but a distant 2nd to my favorite version from Cafe China in NYC. Very good but not great.  Diced rabbit in mother-in-law sauce. While many at the table loved the ingredients of this dish, for me and a couple others, the rabbit was sooooo boney it took the pleasure out of eating this dish. The flavors were excellent (chili oil, scallions and other veggies I believe) and again the balance of heat was perfect. It's just those darn bones...  Crisped rice with shrimp. This was a very interesting dish and not at all what I was expecting. The rice was more puffed that was crispy. Like all the other dishes this was well balanced with a tinge more sweetness and a level higher in spice, mostly because of the fact that I ate the peppers (dried red chili and serrano).  Ma Po Tofu. My friend had extolled the virtues of this dish so there was no chance we would not order it. My experience with Ma Po tofu in the past has never been good so I was a little hesitant to try. But at a meal like this you HAVE to try everything at least once. Thank God I did. What a wonderful dish. Nice textures, the tofu headlining (we commented that a bit more silky, fresher would make it even better) with the minced pork and sauce perfectly complementing.  Fried rice. Cmon, seriously! Who orders fried rice at a place like this? Make sure you order the fried rice here!!! WOW! I'm not 100% sure which version we ordered but my guess is we ordered the Chengdu Style fried rice. Everything about this rice was perfect. Texture, flavor, spice...EVERYTHING. It's fried rice so don't expect a life changing dish but it was one of the best I have had. Perfectly complementary to the entire meal.  Sichuan Potatoes. Think potato chip, almost. Fried twice and perfectly spiced. Without a doubt get these as a side. A wonderful plate.  Stir fried greens with garlic (maybe a watercress???). They did not have the snow pea leaves so we left it in the hands of our waiter, who was simply wonderful and patient! Like the potatoes, a great dish and a perfect side for the meal.  So in short, as long as you are not one of those diners that need an Adam Tihany designed room, constant adoration from the waitstaff and don't need the owner to fawn all over you, RUN to Chengdu Taste, do not walk. My advice is to go early (we arrived at 6pm and the place was 3/4s full and 15 minutes later there was a line) and order often. This places is a must!",

    "text": "My stomach lining is undergoing a severe battle six hours after dinner because Schezuan food just KICKED MY ASS. Let my story be a warning to any Schezuan noobs out there.  But first, here's the deal: I'm giving this place four stars respectfully to the cuisine and to this place which is apparently one of the best Schezuan places around. (The star docked off is due to an even worse lackluster customer service than most typical Asian places.)   SO.... There are these things prevalent in most Schezuan dishes (especially the boiled fish in green \"sauce\" pictured everywhere on this Yelp page) called peppercorns. Other reviewers below politely *kinda* tell you about them before deflecting to another point of their meal. But really, they should give a huge flag about this. When these peppercorns go co-mingling with chili oil, as it does in a majority of these popular dishes, these little balls of hell make your tongue feel not only numb but UNMERCIFULLY attacked with this stinging sensation that is left with a bitter, not-great-tasting aftertaste. Rice is your only friend until you realize, as you shovel it down your mouth, it's just carrying the chili oil into your esophagus and into your stomach.  And see, those photos and the way they prepare that dish makes the sauce appear clear, when really, if you put Truth-O-Meter Glasses on, should be a flaming HOT, FIERY RED dish. But it sits there so unassumingly.   I'll insert a note here that, yes, if you managed to trick your brain into tasting the fish before the heat kicks in, the taste is rather delicious. But the oil that engulfs your tongue soon afterward makes it fall short for me. And let it be known that if you get the fresh fish versus just fish, you're given a catfish with TONS of bones rather than tilapia filets. Normally, I'm never deterred from bones (and farm-raised tilapia is not a good nor healthy fish to eat), but when your whole being is on fire, you don't want to suffer for little slivers of meat that you're picking off of bones.  My mom decided to order this dish of a vegetable mix with lotus root, potatoes, soy sprouts, and mushrooms in their house special hot sauce, which came out perhaps 15 minutes after the boiled fish in green sauce. We were sitting there contemplating whether to cancel our order because now we were taking their claim of \"hot sauce\" rather seriously.  So this pile of vegetables arrives (which looks like it could feed 4 people) and no Truth-O-Meter glasses are needed here; it was sitting in FLAMING HELL-RED CHILI OIL.   My mom was quite adorable... she wanted to be a trooper and eat some of it (actually, by dipping the vegetable into the other dish's sauce to clear off the actual red chili oil sauce). Half an hour after the meal, her ears were still colored a bright red. Instead of peppercorns, they threw straight-up pepper seeds ALL OVER. There is no mercy in this place.  Thinking ahead to my digestive system, I thought I'd be smart and refrain from eating more than ten bites of the fish and a curious bite of the vegetable mix (which was hotter). We ordered the toothpick lamb with cumin -- you could have this either spicy or non-spicy and thank gad we ordered this non-spicy -- and I mostly ate this. It was quite delicious. What can be not delicious about little fried bits of grisly lamb?  Well alas, here I am, and my stomach has a knot in it even from the limited heat exposure. You'd think being Chinese would give me some sort of genetic defensive points -- some shield on the heat -- but man, did I find out that we are most definitely southern Chinese who enjoy sambal and/or Sriracha and call it a day. I looked around at the rest of the clientele and saw they were all most definitely northern Chinese, just eating these same dishes without breaking a sweat. They are like the other Yelp reviewers on this page who don't comment on the spice level in ALL CAPS. They are not human, in my opinion. \"Tis just a flesh wound...\"",

We ordered toothpick lamb (great), the green pepper fish (cooked well but really salty, never had that problem in Alhambra), mapo tofu (salty and unremarkable), and beef dish.   The wait was pretty long - at least 45 min. The host was nice but our waiter was pretty rude. He kept rushing us because it was close to closing time so we got our orders in and he assured us we could order more rice later since they didn't need the chef for that. Halfway through we asked the female server for rice and more tea. She brought the tea but not the rice so we reminded her we had ordered rice and after another long wait the waiter came and told us that they were out of rice and it was our fault for not ordering it earlier (despite having assured us we could order rice later) and then he went on and on about it being late and the chef being tired. So the first girl apparently didn't want to tell us they ran out of rice and it took them over twenty minutes to tell us that. Luckily I ran to the restaurant next door and bought rice to go and it was much better, not mushy like theirs.",

I waited for about 20 minutes before being seated. It seems common for them to give you a shorter wait time if you're able to share tables with another party.   The food itself was decent. I don't love spicy food (which is odd I even came here, I know), but the people I was with, who do, thought it was average.

There was an oily white yam we saw others order that wasn't spicy that was a perfect thing to eat in between very intense bites  The fish poached in a pool of peppers was my favorite.   I think I enjoyed eating the leftovers at room temp a few hours later even more.  Can't wait to go back",

Pushy, bitchy  offered no recommendations other than hurry F up and order.  She was also upset we didn't order everything at once.. she brought us forks without us asking just to rub in what white pieces of shit we were. Right from the start I knew this was going to be an epic meal..  This being said this makes this the best Chinese restaurant  ever.. the Holy grail of szechuan and really  everything.  I'm obsessed with this restaurant. It's not a place for mammalukes. If you have thin skin and can't deal with being abused by Chinese people don't come here.    Get ready for your ass to burn like hell beyond spicy .. spicy on another level,  so hot and balanced. Liquid fire coming in. Ring of fire on the way out..  Hard to remember what I have ate here because I was busy wiping my runny nose from the spice.   Everything here is perfection so far. I have been 3 times.. chengdu taste changed my life.  Nothing can touch this place.  Do not trust anyone who has given this place less than 5 stars. They literally deserve to die for trying to disgrace this joint.",

The new owner remodeled the place so it looks a lot cleaner. The whole store is brighter. The food is very good. There is peppercorn that is numbing. The food isn't just spicy but it has many layers of flavored. Everything is very fresh.   Will come here again when in Vegas.",

    "text": "I grew up in Chongqing of Sichuan/Szechuan province, where Chengdu is the capital. Growing up with eating spicy food, I had certain expectations coming into this place, for a lot of dishes were familiar from back home. The place was busy on a Thursday evening, of mostly Chinese customers. We ordered a \"mung bean jelly noodle with chill sauce\" for appetizer, and it tasted great. The flavor and amount of spice was right, but I'd say the noodles weren't cold enough, more so just room-temp, to be considered a cold noodle dish. To share amongst the four of us, we ordered a \"red tofu, pig intestine, mix veg & beef tripe in spicy soup\" and a \"boiled beef in hot sauce\", for we saw the portions of the dishes were huge, and didn't want to order more than we could finish. The table that came before us had a huge party...so it took quite a while before our food came. The boiled beef tasted awesome, very authentic and super spicy. The red tofu & tripe, on the other hand, wasn't all that great. We got it medium spice to balance the other dish out a bit, but the flavor just wasn't enough. Also for those who don't know what red tofu is...it's ultimately pig's blood, so if you're not into that, just a heads up. However, if you ARE into that, the red tofu in this dish is NOT authentic. It should be soft and tender like real tofu, but instead, it's a bit tough and grainy...  We didn't end up finishing the red tofu soup but destroyed the boiled beef. Also spicy food is perfect to eat with some cold beer, but the restaurant doesn't have their alcohol license yet, so expect to drink lots of water instead...  If you don't eat spicy food, don't come here. It's what the Sichuan province is known for and you'd be missing out if you don't order anything spicy. I would come back, maybe after they get their alcohol license, and order new dishes to try.",

But thank god there's Chengdu Taste because it's one of the few places that I personally think makes Chinese food just right. This is specifically Chengdu dishes, which favors more on spicy foods. But they also have a lot of dishes that are not spicy. One of my all-time favorite dish to order here is the spicy boiled fish (a very well known Sichuan dish!) super fresh and with a great blend of spices added to them. Some other dishes I really like is the toothpick lamb and the sliced beef in chili sauce (aka ). However, one thing I would note is that some of their dishes can be a little oily, but not at all to a point that's unbearable! Overall, I love this place and I always come here with my family when I'm craving some spicy dishes! :)",

We ordered pork belly with garlic sauce and eggplant with garlic sauce. Both of them tasted delicious!  The service was also great. I'm bit surprised that they don't serve hot water/tea here.

I also liked that there was an NA place across the street.  Gives the place an authentic feel.  We walked in on a Friday night around 7pm.  It wasn't too busy and we were seated pretty quickly.  If you are a single or a 2 top and there aren't smaller tables on the sides available, they will put you at a communal table.  I have no problem with this but fortunately we were able to get our own table.  The menu is kind of large, but that's to be expected at a Chinese restaurant I think.  This was our first time here and everything was excellent.  I mean just freaking good.  Very authentic which I really appreciate.  We had to try the toothpick cumin lamb.  Very good.  I thought it had just the right amount of cumin and spiciness.  I'm not a huge fan of the texture of fat but there were enough crispy bits that made it easy for me to eat.  We also got the boiled fish in green sauce and the sauteed green beans.  The boiled fish I think I'll crave for quite some time.  It was probably the best thing I've had all week.  I like the green beans but the meat that it's cooked with can be a little salty.    The service was ok.  No, we didn't get checked on but it wasn't a hassle to call a server over to us.    Can't wait to come back to try some of the other items on the menu!!!",

    "text": "Every time I drive through Las Vegas I go to this restaurant despite the huge number of great food options in the city. The main reason is this: I have spent quite a lot of time living in Hong Kong and traveling around Mainland China, but Chengdu Taste has the best tasting Sichuan food I've ever had. I might even call it my favorite restaurant.  Hands down the best dish is their dan dan mian (), which combines incredibly fresh and chewy noodles with masterfully reduced ground pork and a hot chili oil that has a flavor profile I've never experienced elsewhere.  If you're ever here and haven't spent a lot of time in  Sichuan province, I recommend trying their plum juice. It tastes surprisingly like BBQ sauce (seriously), but in a subtle way that tastes surprisingly good and is kind of exciting.",

This spot was poppin on a Tuesday night with 6 tables ahead of us and at least 4 more parties arriving immediately after us. I thought the wait would be long since their dining area is pretty small, but we got seated after just 15 minutes!  I brought my grandparents here even though they can't handle heat. They really wanted to come because they couldn't imagine their non-spicy items not being good if I like their spicy items so much. Well, they were wrong. Our two non spicy dishes of marinated pigs feet and tofu fish were miles away in flavor compared to our toothpick lamb and our green beans, even though both of these \"spicy\" dishes are low on heat. If you come here, I highly encourage ordering their spicy items.  The employees here are all very friendly, but service was spotty due to the busyness. The funniest part was that we asked for a water refill and they took our water carafe and never came back with it. Couldn't even flag them down for it until we finished our meal. No biggie though. 4 star experience this time but I'll still keep coming back",

Be prepared to not be able to feel your tongue half way through this dish, but trust me when I say it's the good kind of pain  Dan dan Noodles- i ate almost all of it by myself- I kept going for seconds and thirds because the flavor was just exceptional with interesting and crunchy peanutty nuggets and minced meat mixed through. I will be dreaming good dreams about this to night.   Kung pao shrimp- sweet and spicy with roasted peanuts and tender shrimp. I loved this dish.. my favorite of all.

    "text": "This is a gem of authentic Chinese food. It felt so homey with everyone speaking Chinese and the workers hustling around the restaurant. The food is sooo good and so spicy which is my fave. They out a lot of peppercorn to make the numbing spice which is characteristic of Chengdu.   Their sauteed string beans ($11.99) are so flavorful, you can definitely tell it was cooked at high heat in a wok. Tons of seasoning and spice, and surprisingly not too oily. The boiled beef in hot sauce ($16.99) is also bursting with flavor. It's in a bit pot of hot chili oil with bean sprouts and other veggies. They don't skimp on the peppercorns and beef! Even when I though I was all done, there was more beef at the bottom.   Rice is $1/bowl but they are really big bowls. You're gonna need the rice because everything is spicy and you need to pair it with something. Two bowls of rice is more than enough for three people though.  Service is all over the place, which is as expected. They get really busy and yell things across the room to communicate. It's comforting in a way if you've grown up eating at restaurants like this.  **CAUTION** This is not reflective of the restaurant in anyway. Last time I was here, there was an old white couple in a white car driving around for at least an hour. They stopped and asked if we spoke English and the man said they were at LV for vacation and we're on the way to go home when their credit card got declined. He claimed that the credit card company wouldn't open it because he went $2000 over (that's not even possible) and then later claimed he couldn't call the company (then how did they tell you it went $2000 over?). He asked for $100 to get gas twice on his 6 hour drive to Reno while his wife acted scared, trying to call using her phone. He said he could pay everything back because he's a property owner and said he would give his number. We ended up saying we didn't have much cash, and then he asked how much we can help him out. We said sorry and walked away.  Another group saw us talking to him and told us he did  the same thing an hour ago. When the owner of the restaurant heard this, he said he's here everyday trying to scam money out of Chinese people. Beware if you see this guy and don't fall for it!",

When you eat spicy foods it makes you want to eat rice, which is cheap & fills you up. -Anyway, back to the food here at Chengdu: it's f*cking GOOD!  Overall, take a look at the two dishes below & when you are in Vegas again, stop by for an authentic meal here!",

Soft noodles topped with a nice sauce enhanced by crunchy beans.  4.5/5  * Shrimp with crispy rice crust:  our waitress recommended this when we were waffling between the crawfish dishes and the special shrimp.  The crispy rice crackers were much tastier than anticipated, and the shrimp was flavorful and fresh.  4.5/5  * Toothpick lamb with cumin:  Wish these had a bit more cumin.  The lamb was tasty but could have packed more punch.  3.5/5  * Spicy boiling fish filet :  Good rendition with nice spice.  4/5  * Wonton with chili sauce:  soft skin, juicy wontons.  We liked these slightly more than the chili wontons at Mian which we had the previous day since these were juicier.  4.5/5  * Baby bok choy:  the restaurant surprisingly doesn't have much to offer for green leafy veggies.  Their rendition was a nice counterpoint to the spicy dishes.  4.5/5  While it looks like many of the dishes were rated highly, I don't think I would reorder any of them if I visited again since I didn't fall in love with any of them.  But overall this is a good choice if you're craving Sichuan in Vegas.",

Odd, but I enjoyed it.   We got the kung pao chicken, probably the best I've ever had. Lots and lots of peppers and peanuts. Kind of greasy but yum!    Twice cooked pork with really thin bacon looking pieces was good, probably not as salty as I would like (which I never thought I'd say eating at a Chinese/Taiwanese place).   Boiled fish in chile sauce....super soft fish with tons of bean sprouts and lots of chile sauce. Honestly I could barely eat it after we had filled up on the other two dishes (they'd forgotten we ordered it), plus it was so temperature hot so the more I sat there and waited for it to cool down, the fuller I got. Took it to go but as you can imagine, it wasn't the same after reheating. I'd love to go again and try it though. Again, probably wasn't as salty as it could've been, but I actually appreciate that.   Over all, I will definitely go back and try some other things!",

    "text": "I read lots of reviews and saw a lot of pictures for this place so I knew I had to give it a try.  We tried the cold noodles, lamb with cumin, kung-pao chicken, eggplant, deep fried chicken with dried chilis and beef with rice.  The cold noodles was quite bland and had very little spice. At this point, we told the servers we wanted the rest of the dishes to be extra spicy. We are glad we did. The other dishes was tasty, spicy and full of flavour. The beef with rice was the only non-spicy dish which was nice since it toned down the spice for us. if you enjoy spicy food, I recommend this place. The only bad part is they do not serve alcohol. We can for a later lunch around 2pm and we were able to get a table right away.",

But because of its scarcity, the wait can get ridiculous sometimes. So we came here with a group of 6 and put our names down, had to wait for a long time (more than 1hr) to get a table. What's even more ridiculous is that there was a group of 4 next to us, added 2 people last minute and got ahead to have our table after the host informed us that our table is ready... resulting another 50+min wait. How is that fair to us? And the host did not feel sorry at all with an incredible level of attitude and lack of hospitality. Disappointing is not even close to how I think about this experience. Not worth your time.",

You might have to wait outside for a half hour in 100 degree heat after putting your name on the list for dinner, but it's worth it.   If you can go during the week during lunch chances are the wait will be far shorter and you'll get seated right away if it's just 2 or 4 people.   The mapo tofu, wontons with chili oil (give them a good stir!) and toothpick lamb are my favorites but everything I've tried here is good.   If you can, go with a small group and go family style to try a bunch of different dishes.   Service was a bit more, uh, \"traditional\" and brusque in the past, which didn't bother me. If you're unfamiliar with Szechuan food (protip: it's mostly spicy) the waitstaff can answer questions, also if like me you want to branch out a bit.   They're getting some great quality peppercorns! Really nailed that \"heat and slight numbness\" that's characteristic of good Szechuan.",

Then again, the flavors won't be for everyone so I wouldn't come here if you're not open to trying new and weird ingredients and tastes.  The food is extremely spicy.  Sometimes too much in an overpowering, mask the flavor sort of way, but great if you dig hotness.  The prices are a little expensive.  The Chinese in this town seems to run high though, and you're getting an authentic dish, but overall the price was a little much for me.  If you're looking for tradition faire from the region, come here, and just know that Vegas prices are on point here.",

We ordered:  * mung bean jelly noodle with chili sauce - this is a cold noodle dish. The flavor is very good. We ordered it mild, but it was still really spicy.  * fish with green pepper sauce - rated by Jonathan Gold as one of the best dishes in LA. I don't know if I'd go as far as saying its that good, but it's good. Maybe it lacked a little flavor, but the fish was cooked perfectly. Like buttah.  * toothpick lamb with cumin - I love the taste of cumin, and this is always my favorite dish at Sichuan restaurants. I must say theirs is the best I've had. I could eat it everyday.   I definitely recommend this restaurant if you're into this spicy style of Chinese cooking. RIP to Yunnan Garden next door, which serves the same style of food. They'll probably be going out of business. Lol. Can't wait to go back here and try different dishes. Everything looks so good, and from what I've tasted so far, I'm sure I won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "This is definitely a hidden gem . . . well, not anymore, since it's been highlighted in recent food articles and Baby Cobra Ali Wong frequented like just last week and shared a story of their mouthwatering dishes on Insta.   So perhaps no longer a hidden gem, but physically a pretty well-hidden joint, as we out-of-towners had a slight doozy of a time trying to find it. I can't accurately describe it. It's like inside a labyrinth of an outdoor strip mall, but has its own store front access. You'll understand when, not if, you go. You'll go. You have to. You really should.  Anywho, service was prompt and friendly. You'll go far if you speak Mandarin, or try to like me: \"juh-ge\" (this one), \"nuh-ge\" (that one), and then reinforce the order by pointing at the picture of the corresponding dish.   Their food is definitely at a way higher price point than your run-of-the-mill resto in Chinatown, but the value was immediately understood upon sampling the dishes: fish filet in hot chili pepper sauce, toothpick cumin lamb, and green beans. SO good. SO fresh. The fatty juicy crispy cumin lamb. The numbing Sichuan peppercorn. Washed down by countless cups of jasmine tea. Tastes just like the stuff in real Chengdu, China.   My mom has incorrigibly high expectations when it comes to Chinese food AND she would NEVER EVERRRRR pick or sit down willingly at a place with an entree averaging $18. The husband and I were incredibly nervous about how things would turn out, because it's ALWAYS unpredictable. The situation can turn on a dime.   She's put plates on a restaurant floor. She's walked out after the food had been served without paying. She's refused to tip. She's complained countless times on how small the portions are or have become, how the fish or veggies are not fresh, how tough the meat is, how fatty, sugary, or too salty things are. She's bitched out waitstaff and owners alike.   That being said, HER mind was blown. If my mom had nary a single negative thing to say about the quality and taste AND did not indicate it was too expensive, truly rest assured that Chengdu Taste serves A+ food.",

The place was full but we didn't have to wait for seats. I noticed they don't have a lot of tables, so they definitely don't crowd you in. It was small, and simple in decor, but don't be fooled by the simple appearance or the fact that the entrance is in the alley. The food taste was amazing. I can see why all the critics rave about it.  We were lucky because when we got there, there wasn't a wait. But from what I was told, there is typically a line out the door. Try to arrive before peak hours to avoid any \"bad taste\" left in your mouth.  I can't really speak to the staff because my friends handled everything. But I will say that even though he only comes to their establishment 2-3 times a year, they still knew him and seemed friendly.  If you are looking for authentic Chinese in Vegas, this is the spot!",

    "text": "While in Vegas, I was looking for an authentic Chinese restaurant to bring my parents to. With the help of Yelp, I found this highly rated place. First night, we got here around 5:30pm and the line was already massive so we actually went to the place next door which was still decent. The next time, we came around 4:30pm and the restaurant was still full so I got a number. That's how popular this place is. We waited at least 30 minutes for a table.  Once our number got called, we sat down and ordered the food. Of course, we had to order the famous toothpick lamb which everyone absolutely raves about. We also ordered a mix veggie dish and a beef dish as well. Since rice didn't come with our dishes, we also ordered the shrimp fried rice.  The toothpick lamb came last, which was unfortunate since we were all pretty full by the end. However, I still soldiered on and had to try it. Honestly, it was probably the best lamb dish I've had. It's covered with spices like cumin and chili powder but its also got a slight sweetness as well.  The shrimp fried rice was also quite good. They definitely did not skimp out on the shrimp. They were absolutely massive and you get tons of shrimp! The rice itself was cooked perfectly.  If you want that authentic Szechuan food experience while in Vegas, stop by this place in Chinatown and come early!",

I wish that they served dishes in portion and 1/2 portion sizes.  The whole portion is a lot of food.  If they had 1/2 portions, you could try more of the menu. The service.  You order the food, the food is brought, your left overs are wrapped up, and then you pay the bill.  My only critique.

Sichuan is the birthplace of Chinese hotpot but this restaurant specializes in more dry pot and stir fry dishes. Chef owner Tony Xu started his famous Chengdu Taste in LA back in 2013.   The LA location is bit larger and the decor is nicer. But Vegas location is just as good in taste which is the reason most people visit. Chef Xu also opened a noodle shop nearby called \"Mian\" do not leave Vegas without a visit.   The menu is very English friendly with big pictures. The most popular item is Toothpick Lamb, but try some other Sichuan dish such as Twice cooked pork, Kung Pao Chicken, Saute Eggplant, and MaPo Tofu.   Writing this makes me hungry and I'm already looking at cheap Frontier flights to Vegas because food in heaven might not taste as good as in Chengdu in Vegas.",

It was all very unique, flavorful, and mostly SPICY! It's hugely popular here and there will most likely be a wait if you go.   This is a legit Chinese spot. They legit barely speak English and the patrons that eat here are Chinese folk. 98% of the menu is marked as spicy. They have a huge variety of stir fries, hot pots, and meats of all variety. They have some signature dishes but the one that most people write about is their lamb tooth pick.  I honestly don't remember what we ordered but I will say that the food is good. The food is fresh, the food is unique. The service is good enough. I can't make this at home. I will come back here. If you want to try Szechuan food to see what the hype is about I definitely recommend this place. Make sure you always have water.  I'll post about the food in the captions of the photos I post.",

The space isn't very big, they only have 2 round tables for large groups. There was another group of over 10 before us.  We waited for about an hour and half at 7pm on a Sunday.  The good thing is this is located in a plaza of multiple restaurants, and there's another plaza nearby within walking distance.  Some us walked around and got boba and that made the wait not too bad.  There's also a good amount of parking.  Most of the food have the Szechuan spice, it really hit the spot.  Unfortunately, they ran out of the famous skewer dishes when we got to our table.  The most memorable dish for me was this lamb that's on bones, I forget the exact name but it was delicious.",

    "text": "First, let me start off by saying I'm not Chinese, but I've been to China a handful of times and have experienced traditional cuisine. I generally like Chinese food, but I'm not an aficionado or expert by any means. So this review is for the non-Chinese who may be interested in trying this restaurant. If you are Chinese and familiar with this cuisine style please disregard this review. First, the place is really crowded, and there is a considerable wait to get in. I'd say 95% of the patrons are Chinese, which is always a good sign and indicates the food is authentic. I don't mind waiting for good food and would never reduce my rating because of a long wait. The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly, the service was good. The prices are also very reasonable.  The food is fresh. We had the string beans, shrimp, and an appetizer of cold noodles. Also one other dish I can't recall at this time. Up until this point I'd give the restaurant a solid 4-star review. All of the food we ordered did make our tongues \"numb\". While this was amusing at first when we tried the appetizer, it became a bit redundant and slightly uncomfortable as we progressed through our meal.  I'm not sure if all of the items on the menu do this, or we were unlucky enough to pick only the \"tongue numbing\" items, but it did not make for an enjoyable meal. I like spicy food, and have been to Thailand 3 times, and can eat traditional Thai, as well as Schezwan style, but this was an entirely different experience altogether. The Thai people in my group did not enjoy the meal either.  I should have done some additional research prior to selecting Chengdu Taste, so this is my fault. If you are not Chinese you may consider trying a different cuisine style and pass on this restaurant. Again, everything else was a solid 4-stars, its just that the food was pretty far outside of my comfort zone. As I reflect on my experience I'd give 4-stars if the \"tongue numbing\" ingredients were left out of each dish, but then it would be like every other decent Chinese restaurant I've frequented.",

From the produce, sauces, and presentation of the dishes, Chengdu Taste knows what it takes to make your visit special and memorable.   My favorite dish of the night was the simmer caldron of Boiling Beef in Sichuan Hot Sauce. The beef was tender and mixed with the fantastic sauce giving every bite a nice bit of spice and peppers really hit home! From all the awards and accolades around the dining area is a True testament as to the best Sichuan restaurant of Vegas!",

Don't be fooled.  This stuff is tasty buy crazy hot.  When they say red and green pepper they aren't talking bell peppers, rather green or ripe chilies!  That said, despite dishes being mouth numbing, all tasted, display a clean, very pronounced pleasing pepper taste.  On advice of others, opted to bypass boiled dishes instead opted for the brighter flavors of steamed and sauteed dishes or the more complex casserole. Sadly the spiciness of the dishes eventually overpower the ability to distinguish the flavor of each, however, our choices were well cooked (not overcooked or dried, tender and moist proteins).  Recommended; the frog with red and green pepper (the tender, near neutral flavor of the frog is a great foil for the chili flavor), griddle cooked beef with mixed veg (good sweetness), diced rabbit with baby ginger (tender rabbit nuggets sweetened by the earthy bite of ginger and spice), toothpick lamb with cumin (dry rubbed, skewered, sauteed with chili oil and dry chili), and sauteed chili eggplant (sweet, cooked through sponge of chili goodness).  Asian service.  Prices reflect the cost of chilies.  Selected dishes $15-$23 each.  Tasty, fun, but definitely punishing for those who don't crave heat.",

Slim picking for non spicy food on the menu, I think only 2 dishes available, but he loved the fried rice.  I don't recommend bringing children here until they can tolerate a lot of spices and heat.  The beef brisket noodle dish was bland and it was just not flavorful and swimming in about a 1/2 inch of chili oil.  This is one that we would not order again.

I've traveled all across China and I'm happy to say this restaurant is authentic Sichuan Chinese cuisine.  You MUST try the mung bean jelly noodles to start!  It is small bowl but filling, so I would recommend sharing the bowl with a partner that way you won't fill your stomach up too much.  Also, there is a spice in the noodles that will numb your tongue after many bites.  This is a normal, harmless spice.  The fish filet in green pepper soup is delicious.  It is certainly spicy but I didn't notice it too much when I put the fish in rice. I also tried the fish filet in red pepper soup and it was even better than the former!  They both actually have different flavors so I recommend coming back for the other one. Don't forget the rice!  And this is big enough to fill up two people.  The shredded pork with garlic sauce was a favorite as well.  It's certainly less spicy than most things on the menu and goes well with rice.     This restaurant is certainly not your average American Chinese type of establishment.  If you want to try the real deal then this is the place to start.  Food from the Sichuan province is known to be spicy as well, so don't forget to order the water with your meal!",

Then for the entree we tried the cumin lamb on toothpicks which was delicious, too. My son had the twice-cooked pork fried rice that was okay. I LOVE spicy and my son not so much, so the spicy level of the food was a bit too much for him and not nearly enough for me, but overall I love this place.

The heat was a bit much but I can always live with that as I like spicy food however the amount of ginger was rough in a couple dishes. I think we ordered four things and didn't like any of them which is rare for a foodie like myself. It may just be an issue of the menu not being amenable to my taste buds",

Waitress told me to walk out the door & sign to be seated. Wasn't that busy, had 1 table w/6 seats another had 10 seats. Found the signing board. Signed for 3ppl. Waited for 7min. 4 customers just walked by & signed for 4ppl. Waitress walked out & called them in. My friend approached her & asked we were first, waitress said she only saw 2ppl signed under my name, said it's a bigger table then let these customers take the table. Fine. Wait for another 7min, waiter walked out if we want to share table? Referred not. Two more customers walked in the door & the waiter took them to be seated. Nevermind, we gave up & walked to next door, Yunan restaurant. Very disappointed. Will not be going to this restaurant even with good food!",

But you should be aware that it is impossible to make authentic chengdu food that is not spicy at all. The popular dishes are all very good. Our favorite is toufu pudding and beef in hot sauce. It came with 2 chilis on the menu ( meaning really hot), you may ask the chef to tone it down. We did, and it was gooood. :) Enjoy!",

I believe that I counted at least six different kinds of peppers in the various dishes that we ate. I am not sure why they put tilapia  in the soup dish because you really couldn't taste it. That is is not exactly accurate but there were at least three kinds of peppers in this lemon grass-based soup or stew, not including the hot oil that created the cauldron of fire that was emanating from my from my mouth. In fact my wife was ready to take me to the hospital as the tears were running down my cheeks. I grow hot peppers at my house and enjoy heat, but my warning to my fellow caucasians is to be very careful of what you order in this restaurant. We ordered five dishes in which none of which exceeded one star for heat. By the way, I couldn't answer my wife of whether I wanted to go to the hospital because I really couldn't talk.  My mouth, my mouth...  I am pretty sure that the combined Scofield count of what  I ate this evening was clearly in the millions. There was one small brownish crushed pepper in the above dish that I was not able to identify. That pepper alone created a circus in my mouth - no, more like a cirque de Soleil event. It was with this additional pepper  that I prayed there was some ice cream on the menu, but there was none. At one point I really could not talk to anybody at the table, because every taste bud on my tongue was stimulated (think fried, burnt, singed.   24 hours later  My rectum My rectum  That's right, the experience continues. I think that same little black pepper may be the culprit. However it could've been the jalapenos or the Thai chilies. Maybe it was the hot chili oil that they used to cook several of the dishes with. My wife is very concerned, apparently, when I scream in the bathroom. It scares her. I don't care if it scares her, because I am in pain.  You learn a lot about various cultures by the food that they eat.  I will return to this restaurant the future. But lemongrass this got the best of me, but not next time. And by the way, if you have a cold but lemongrass dish was mouthless. There was mucus in cavities of my sinuses but I never knew existed. This simple - may be the cure for the common cold.",

Despite the fact that we were just a party of three and it was late (past 8PM), we still had to wait about fifteen minutes for a table (the restaurant is not that big).  Since one of my friends only ate chicken in terms of meat and the other one was vegetarian, we were somewhat limited in what we could order off of the menu. Nonetheless, I was able to order several dishes to share.  The portions here are ENORMOUS and makes the prices more justified. The food is decent, but certainly not the best Sichuan I've ever had.

It had the potential of being my favorite Chinese restaurant in town, but every dish we ordered, and we ordered five of them, was so saturated in salt that it destroyed the delicate flavors I could taste under all that sodium. I did love the spice level and the numbing way of those peppers, but unless I hear that they've really cut down on how much the chef salts the food, I won't be back to try anything else. Too bad. So much potential.",

They also appear to have all my favorite dishes here plus a lot of the more traditional items. I have never seen shredded potatoes with chili and vinegar on a menu in the U.S., and their fried rice, kung pao, and spicy eggplant are just like you would eat in any restaurant in Beijing (that's where I lived, so that is my experience, and I know Beijing has its own food, but we ate a lot of Sichuan dishes while there).   As others have mentioned, this is not an Americanized Chinese restaurant in any sense. The service isn't that attentive, and our waiter did not speak amazing English, but I knew what I wanted, and there were so many things I wanted and only two of us eating, that I might go back tomorrow. Try the kung pao anything - this is real kung pao like you would eat in China. Try the green beans, the shredded pork in spicy sauce, the Chengdu fried rice, the eggplant - these dishes are what Chinese food actually tastes like. There are a lot of traditional things on the menu that aren't totally suited to the typical American palate (lots of intestines, pigs feet, etc), but there is plenty here to love even if you are just a modestly adventurous eater.",

We polished off all the KPC, ate some fish and took the rest home, and ordered a second KPC to enjoy tomorrow after we leave town!  This place is in Chinatown, every table was full and constantly turning over, and there was a crowd waiting outside to get in.   Tip: no alcohol is served, but you can bring your own if you prominently display the sales receipt so they don't get in trouble.  We will definitely eat here again next time in Vegas!",

The service was good and our waiter made some helpful food suggestions. We started with the chicken in chili sauce. It's a cold dish appetizer. The chicken was tender the sauce was spicy and had lots of peanuts in it. The spice of it felt like it left your tongue tingling. Never experienced that before and thought it was pretty cool and interesting. All the dishes that followed suite were equally as spicy. My favorite dishes were the eggplant and the wontons in chili oil. Both had an excellent flavor and spice.   The place is nothing fancy but it's what you expect In Chinatown. Also note that your order has to be over $25 for you to use a credit card. Overall not bad at all. Never had Schezuan food before and it was fun to give it a try. Lots of chili oil on everything. Thankfully they give you a pitcher of water for the table.",

The food is amazing, if you want fire and flavor, authentic Chengdu and Sichuan food with no pretensions, extravagance, or window dressing. It's exactly what you'd get in Chengdu or Chongqing with spicy veggie, chicken, beef, pork, and prawn dishes like grandma made. No doubt they will moderate the level of fire automatically or on request. I'm a lowai, so I specifically asked them to make it proper Chengdu spicy. They obliged.   This is not a typical Americanized Chinese restaurant. If you're expecting sweet sesame chicken, beef and broccoli, and a waiter who checks in to ask how you liked it, this place is not for you. No fortune cookies, you have to flag your waiter down (though no need to shout 'fuwuyuan!') to order and get the check - quite like what you'd expect in a local place Chongqing or Chengdu. It may come off gruff to Americans, but this is a place catering to Sichuan people and non-Chinese who like really spicy, really flavorful food. It's communal eating where dishes are made to be shared and picked at throughout the meal. No single entrees.   They have a standard menu with English and Chinese, and all the waitstaff with whom I've interacted speaks excellent English. Price isn't too high, with a shrimp and chilies dish running ~$15.  If you like spicy Chinese food and understand what you're getting for service, you'll love it here too.",

However we waited 30 minutes to be seated and waited more than 1 hour for our dishes. This is unacceptable! We ordered spicy fish and maocai. Fish was not fresh and the taste was just so so. I can't believe it's a 4.5 star restaurant. What's wrong with these boots? The owner of the restaurant is very rude and yell to the customers to close the door. Next time I will not trust yelp. A terrible experience!",

The meat was tuff and chewy. I also got their dumpling in red sauce, and that was my favorite part of the meal. They were really good, but something in that sauce was made of molten lava! I won't rate the dish any less because of its heat since I know that is how Asians like their food.   The atmosphere is definitely like a True, mediocre Chinese restaurant that you would find in China; however, there are nicer restaurants out there and it would be nice to have spruced the place up based on the price of these dishes. The bathrooms could particularly use some attention. I would suggest to the owner to provide some kind of hand drying options other than your clothes or air drying...",

    "text": "Delicious amazing food! I have had Toothpick Cumin Lamb, the Beef Boiled in Hot Sauce, Chili Wontons, Beef Volcano, Garlic Pork and the Mung Bean Noodles in Chili Sauce. I love how spicy many of the dishes are, the strong complex flavors and the tingly feeling you get from some of the sauces. Everything I have had was delectable and I'm pretty sure I would eat an old shoe if you put their chili sauce on it. If you have the chance you have to try Chengdu!",

    "text": "Wow what can I say? If you like SPICY food and Chinese food than this is your gastronomic destination! Fantastic: crazy spicy, as in my mouth was tingling numb but ALL the flavors are so delicious, clear and evident, so it's not like it burns your mouth and you can't taste anything. The service is typical Asian though which means responsive but not attentive: but was nevertheless friendly and prompt. Highly recommended: mostly Chinese clientele but the staff was completely fluent in English (I don't speak Chinese but my date is fluent) as they answer all the questions I had fluently and friendly. Get extra napkins and let the sweating begin! We had: toothpick lamb with cumin(awesome), fried pig intestine(awesome but if you don't like gamey flavors like goat etc, this may be tough for you) garlic vegetables (awesome flavor not spicy) and finally the Piece de resistance: mung bean noodles with chili sauce!",

    "text": "--This is a positive review, even if it starts bad-- Oh my goodness I had the worst starting experience here... So my family of six Koreans came to this restaurant and it was during the Electronics Convention. Seeing as we went a little late, the business was absolutely packed. We waited for 2 hours for our table, and that's not a big deal because we knew it was a busy restaurant with a small seating area; however, being there for two hours, you see alot of people on the list come and go. One party of five came and waited for about 10 minutes, then went up to the person calling names, and spoke Mandarin to him, pointing to a name of 8, and I can only assume that he was telling him that that was their party and that they just left some people. Now I'm not docking the restaurant for this group, I understand that this happens and that there are some people that just are unsavory; however, I absolutely cannot forgive the ownership for how they handled the situation. They pushed my family aside and told us that this party was here before us, and that we would have to wait and whenever we would try to pull the guy aside and ask him something, he would respond in Mandarin and walk away. Just a tad rude if you ask me.   But as rude as that one guy was, once we finally got our table, the server who came over was one of the nicest people I had ever met. He was super kind to us and very patient. We ordered the lamb on toothpicks and the spicy fish and their fried rice and their double fried pork, and a couple other dishes. The Lamb on Toothpicks was absolutely phenomenal. The cumin accented the flavor so well and it was just enough so that it wasn't overwhelming. I loved it. The fish in chili oil destroyed my mouth, but it was worth EVERY painful second. Everything here was worth the wait, even though those buttmunchers came in and swooped our table and made us wait even longer. The service and the food made up for it though, that I can say for certainty.",
