Our table-side salad prep was impressive, as was our waiter when he plated our filet and lobster for two table-side. This was the best surf and turf we have ever had. We were treated to a complimentary chocolate lava cake for our anniversary with well wishes from all of our table staff. Thank you Hugo's for an amazingly memorable evening.",

The salad is served tableside. Everyone that worked there had a smile on their face and were very friendly. We love the place, but I don't eat in five star restaurants to often but this one remains my favorite. A man in Binions recommended it to us and so glad he did. They don't need to advertise because anyone who eats there will tell everyone they know how great the place is. I hope you can experience their food and their great service.",

    "text": "Hugo's Cellar was recommended to my by a neighbor of my family before I even moved here but was looking for a romantic spot to have dinner with my late Marine Corps Captain bf coming from San Diego. We thought the Four Queens looked a little seedy as we walked in, but the clubby dark decor that greets you as you enter the cellar tells you this is a special place. Lighting is romantic and dim. The hostess greets each lady with a long stemmed red rose which they place In a vase for you. Various breads, lavash and spreads adorn your table along with butter shaped as rosebuds.   Service is spectacular. John, the world's friendliest sommelier has been there for 20 plus years and always seems to remember me (I've been there 3 dozen times in 9 years. Sometimes a few times a week, sometimes with longer spans) he makes great wine selections and we happen to share a great love of Perrier Jouet Fleur du Champagne. Even when I don't order wine, he stops by to visit, a fine British chap. They are also famous for their delicious martinis which come with a mini decanter. Your water glasses remain filled and your waiter is assisted by the salad carte guru and at least one bus boy, and of course the fabulous Sommelier.   I dont order appetizers any longer but the hot stone app was fun. The salad carte which is old school table side has a dizzying array of ingredients and I always go with the parmesan pepper dressing. Usually, I pack half to go. Next an intermezzo of sorbet palate cleanser is served prior to entrees. I usually go for the sea bass en papillote prepared table side and steaming hot tender with a side of potatoes and vegetables. Other diners rave over the chateaubriand for two, prime rib, lobster virtually anything on the menu and enjoyed them thoroughly. Again I get half of my meal to go.   I love this place so much that when my best friend called to ask where to make reservations for our party of 8 next week when visiting from Hawaii to celebrate her hubby making Full Bird Col in AF, his birthday and reception of a Bronze Star; there was no hesitation in my selection. I will call ahead as I frequently do to to ensure John has a bottle of Perrier Jouet Fleur du Champagne on ice to greet us.   After dinner, a platter of dried fruits with white and dark chocolate and dipped strawberries with cream is presented. This is where all of my to go boxes come in: the bananas foster is DIVINE a show in and of itself with flames nearly scorching the ceiling as the perfectly caramelized bananas are served up over vanilla ice cream, the air perfumed with a hint of lingering cinnamon. Heavenly. Plus, I have great leftovers for lunch.   The service is professional, seasoned and on point without being obtrusive. When you leave, your rose is packed up for you along with wonderful memories of a fabulous meal. You could easily pay more at traditional a la carte steak houses but why? Hugo's is a veritable institution and you will walk away happy and sated. And wanting to return.",

Dimly lit in a good way and no windows (you are actually in a basement/cellar).  The food was amazing - we were recommended to go here because we were looking for an excellent steakhouse and we were not disappointed.  Interestingly, the waiter brought a salad cart to our table and assembled our salads for us on the spot.  You can pick the dressing, vegetables, shrimp, cheese, croutons, etc.  In addition, we also got free sorbet to cleanse the pallet between courses.  Overall, the food, environment, and service were all top notch.  Well deserved of my 5 star rating.",

They have us each a rose when we walked in. They has 4 or 5 people attending  to us and we felt so special!  I ordered the Filet with the horseradish crust and OMG!!! I'm salivating just thinking about it! They also brought us dessert that comes with all meals!   To too it all off, it was so incredibly reasonably priced!

I made sure to make a reservation over a month ahead of time because I really wanted to take my wife here for our special day.  They are located in downtown Las Vegas on Fremont Street inside the Four Queens Hotel.  The ambiance was almost perfect for a romantic dinner evening.  Felt like we had traveled back in time because of the decor and atmosphere.  They greeted my wife with a single long stem rose which made my wife very happy.  The food was very good.  Their table side salad was excellent.  Our steaks were delicious.  All evening, the service provided to us by the staff was top notch.  Very classy.  Thanks for a wonderful and memorable anniversary dinner.  Hugo's Cellar is a fine establishment to take your special someone for that special occasion.",

Dimly lit with stone walls, wood beams, heavy linens, and art-glass chandeliers overhead it was to formal greetings and a rose for the ladies that we arrived in the Cellar and whisked away soon to a booth in one of several rooms the action soon commenced, each waiter presented by name as a trio of warm breads with a butter rose plus the famous tableside salad engaged the senses - the later a True crowd pleaser carefully customized for each and every guest.  Large in menu with a bar that promised to craft \"anything you like\" it was with a stiff pair of $7 cocktails that our proper order progressed and soon plucking tender snails under delicate pastry from their dish one really couldn't help but smile at a classic done so well, a theme continued with each of three superlative entrees following a raspberry palate cleanse - the tableside whole duckling a showstopper gathering looks from around the room while the Wellington rivaled that at Ramsay Steak beneath a pile of mushrooms and foie gras.  Truly a class act it was prior to desserts-proper that a trio of chocolate dipped fruits arrived to be dressed in hand-whipped cream and with more sweets offered on the house to celebrate a duo of birthdays it was tableside we turned again - the smolder and burn of booze, fresh fruit, and cinnamon ladled over rich ice cream a refined finish to a True 'experience.'",

I don't mind paying decent money for good food but I don't think the food was worth what we paid tonight. I have been to Hugo's before and it seems as if time has caught up with this place.  As much as they are trying to keep it as a old Las Vegas vibe, the food is deteriorating in quality. 2 filet mignons was 148.00. Of course you get salad and a small desert plate. Again, it was just meh. The service was good. Don't know if I will return or not?",

You get five star service for a the price of a four star place, and that makes a huge difference on your bill.  This means you can splurge a little and get wine or a cocktail, and maybe even a signature dessert.  There's a hired wine expert walking around and he answers any questions you may have, or he just pops out of nowhere and gives suggestions on what to drink. Pretty cool.  Like the wine guy, all the waiters are experienced, personable,and funny. They've all been working there for a looonnng time and probably have some great stories.  The food was magnificent and the best part is is that sides and salads come with the meal! The salad is made right in front of you, and it's a yes no process that feels like an interrogation. LOL.  The filet mignon was thick n juicy and cooked perfectly. The sides were white asparagus and mashies and tasted fine.  Because they bring chocolate dipped fruit after, I decided to try something different and got the kona experience. It looks like a science experiment when they bring it out, but it's basically coffee percolating  in front of you. Kona coffee is some of the best in the world in my opinion, and it tasted divine when it was finished. Pretty cool. If you want a real dessert, then I'd say get the banana foster that's made right in front of you.  The service alone is reason enough for me To go back and I love that it didn't break the bank either.  It's a gem in the city of sin for sure.",

We were seated in a very romantic area and her rose was placed in a vase.  Then we were asked if we wanted wine we knew we wanted champagne so we ordered that after looking over this very extensive wine list and the Sommelier  came over to help us choose. He was great and so friendly. Our wait staff- yes staff- then asked if we wanted any appetizers.  We were ready to order.  My wife ordered the scallops and I ordered the Duck Anise flambe. In case you don't know every entree comes with salad, sorbet to cleanse your palate after the salad and complimentary chocolate covered fruits. David one of our wait staff wheeled over a cart and told he was about to play 20 questions, because you get to pick from 20 items to have on your salad-- from shrimp to hearts of Palm and artichokes to chopped eggs and anchovy. Yes the usual salad items are there but each person picks their own items   After salad raspberry sorbet in a mini ice cream cone was brought to us.  Then came the entrees.  My duck was flambed table side. It was wonderful.  My wife's scallops were out of this world.  Last but definitely not least were the chocolate covered strawberries, apricots and figs. We didn't order any other dessert because we were too full but we did order the Hugo's Cappuccino it's loaded with brandy and some other liqueurs. All the while during this experience our wait staff made sure our glasses were not empty and we had whatever we needed. The sommelier even filled our champagne glasses so we didn't have to.  If you think this was expensive--- well. How about 160 including tax and tip.   Why did we ever wait so long to go there",

When we arrived I was given a long stem rose and we were escorted to our table where there was a vase for my rose.  We had about three different waiters helping us and each one was so nice and clearly put service first.  We had the crab cake appetizer which was amazing.  The salad that each meal comes with was one of the best parts.  They make the salad tableside individually for each guest.  There are many toppings to choose from or have them all.  My boyfriend doesn't like salad dressing so they offered to freshly squeeze lemons onto his salad, he loved it.    For the meal I got the filet mingon with bernaise sauce.  It was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever had.  The bf had the beef wellington which was also amazing.  Even the masked potatos and veggies that it comes with are great.  They brought a hot towel to wash your hands with before dessert.  Then dessert is a complementary chocolate dipped dried apricot, fig, and strawberry.  One of each for each guest.  And fresh whipped cream.  It was so good.  We will definitely be back here.  It is also perfect for a special occasion.",

    "text": "My husband and I dine out a lot, particularly at steakhouses. We did hours of research to decide where we would dine on our Vegas trip and although Hugo's was a bit of a trip from our hotel, my gut said it was worth it.   The entire experience from walking in and receiving my rose, to the great wine list (with even better price points), to the table side salad, palate cleansers, perfectly cooked steak, chocolate covered strawberries and possibly the best coffee (Cona) added up to quite possibly the best dining experience I've had!   Do not miss Hugo's cellar if you are in Vegas and guys if you find this place and take your lady, it's sure to pay off!",

I was given a rose when they seated us.  The food was high class.  The waiter prepared our salad at our table.  I ate the beef wellington which was very tender and cooked perfectly.  There was a delicious half of a tomato that was breaded, seasoned, and baked that I loved.  The asparagus was ok - I'm not an asparagus lover.    My husband had some kind of a breaded veal dish (I don't remember the name).  It came with a king crab leg on top that he said was very yummy.  He also had asparagus which he didn't care for (I guess he's also not an asparagus lover).    For dessert, they brought us a tray of dried fruit dipped in chocolate.",

    "text": "Im a fan of Hugos Cellar.. it didn't blow me away, but the service was great and the food was good. Were it based on service it would be 4-4.5 stars easily.   The occasion was for a birthday dinner, and we had a few drinks, followed by more drinks.. so that helps here with this review :) In addition I am a fan of \"Beef Wellington\" and they had a serving of 'Individual Beef Wellington' on the menu. That was actually what solidified my choice to check it out for the big dinner.   It was myself and a couple of friends, which seemed about right.. but I have to say that it is a very intimate setting.. so it would be very well suited for a date or a couple having a date. Nonetheless, it's worth checking out if you are a group of friends that likes quality food.   The restaurant itself is in a lower level of the \"Four Queens\" Casino... The casino itself may be a bit long in the tooth and has some serious smoking areas still allowed, so be wary of that if you are sensitive to smoke.. because there is A LOT of it.   Down below where the restaurant is located, its dimly lit, old-school style and comfortable feeling. Above where the casino is, its a bit dank, old and crappy.. lol. A friend compared it to snorkeling - in that it looks beautiful when you are down below, and when you raise your head above water, its a little less than exciting.. in fact a dump.. haha.   Anyhow.. our waiter was awesome in relaying the specials. They create a custom salad for you table side then serve your items as ordered, and the meal is followed up by fruits dipped on white chocolate. It was nice, but I could have doe without dried apricots dipped in chalky white chocolate... I just didnt eat it.   I opted for a coffee desert drink as I was getting drunk and needed caffeine :]   So give it a try if you like something with a bit more style. be prepared to drop a few bucks, but make a night of it and head downtown after for some drinks and people watching.",

Our waiter explained to me that since Vegas is a tourist town they are pretty lenient, but it is up to the Maitre'D who he lets in. Just do yourself a favor and don't show up casual. Slacks and a button down shirt is fine for men. A dress is fine for women.  My husband and I were in Las Vegas for my birthday and we went to Hugo's Cellar. It was fantastic!  From the red rose at the door to the chocolate dipped strawberries, figs and apricots, everything was perfection.  I had the rack of lamb and it was so tender (Medium rare).   We were so full after dinner that ordering dessert seemed impossible, Nonetheless we ordered the Banana's Foster. It is made table side the old fashioned way. We only had room for a few bites, but worth it.   We ordered drinks, entrees, and dessert. Price with tip $300. Expensive? Yes The best meal you will ever eat in your life.",

    "text": "Hugo's is my absolute favorite restaurant! It's classic, old-school, fine-dining at accessible prices. The whole restaurant is very dark and romantic, with ladies being given a rose upon entrance (they put the roses at your table, and then wrap them for you to take when you leave).  Larger parties have multiple teams of servers helping them, and a competant sommalier makes rounds, helping guests select the perfect wine pairings. Every entree comes with the signature Hugo's salad -- where they literally bring a salad bar to your table and make each salad to the specific diner's request. You can load up on pine nuts, artichokes, hearts of palm, shrimp, hard-boiled egg, parmesan cheese, anchovies, etc. -- it's all up to the diner.  After the salad course, delicious sorbet is served in mini cones as a delightful palate-cleanser.  Then the sumtious main course never disappoints - I'm a big fan of the Hugo Chicken - it's well-priced and yummy!  Every dinner is topped off with a selection of fruits dipped in chocolate and served with real whipped cream. In addition, you can select a tasty treat from the dessert tray, or pick on of their specialty flambe desserts. This time we opted for the flambe route - choosing the Bananas Foster. BEST. BANANAS. EVER!  The staff is so lovely - they really know the meaning of customer service. You leave Hugo's full, happy, satisfied, and with a lovely rose. You also get to take some amazing pictures in Downtown Las Vegas -- it's a seedy place, but those lights make for some killer photo ops. Also, if you're feeling seedy, you can stick around the Four Queens Hotel for some $5 blackjack on a Saturday night. I had lost $100 on the Strip, made it back and then some Downtown.   Honestly, I've gone to other high-end restaurants and didn't leave nearly as satisfied as I did leaving Hugo's -- which is why I've been back again and again. Don't be fooled by the big names - Hugo's is the place to be!",

It's downstairs in the Four Queens, and although the casino is bright and loud, the restaurant is quiet. They hand you a rose when you get there. After sitting down they suggested the raspberry lemon martini and it was EXCELLENT! Make sure you have some of the complimentary bottled water to go along with your alcohol because they don't skimp on drinks. While you're at it eat some of the cheese toasted lavosh or buttered rolls. There were some other families there celebrating birthdays and no one was really dressed up.   They make your salad table-side and with a huge array of toppings to choose from. I had tiny shrimp on mine and honey-walnut vinaigrette. They had to warn me against eating too much of it because we had a lot more food coming.   We got the crab cakes for an appetizer and I'm sure they were the best I ever had. Definitely try them with the aoli sauce. After that they gave us raspberry sorbet in tiny cones to cleanse the palate. My favorite part of the whole night was the server's accent. I felt like I had gone back in time to Old Vegas. For my entree I had the raspberry chicken, it came in a fantastic cream sauce with white and green asparagus and roasted garlic whipped potatoes. My date had duck with mandarin oranges and wild rice, also fantastic. Or course I took home the leftovers of both and ate them the next day for lunch.  We planned on getting the bananas foster for dessert but were too full. They also give you chocolate covered strawberries, apricots and figs with a whipped cream. The figs are awesome! I definitely recommend this place for a nice date or family celebration. Super service and excellent food.",

I was undecided on what to order so I let Vincent our waiter choose for me and the veal chop was excellent.  He provided excellent service but no one compares to John the sommelier. His personality and his wine selection complimented the meal perfectly. The only problem we experienced was when a couple came in with their teenage son and little girl. We are fine with children dining at adult restaurants however the little girl was watching a movie on an iPad WITHOUT headphones right next to our table. I really would have appreciated if the restaurant would have requested that the child either use headphones or shut off the movie.  Listening to a child's movie while trying to enjoy a romantic dinner was quite annoying.",

We waited at the bar for 5 or 10 minutes and had a great round of drinks. And coming from New York, they were reasonably priced.  The host then handed all the ladies a single red rose and we were escorted to our table. The table was in a private room and our roses were placed in vases in the center of the table. So pretty. The service was impeccable, and the prices were great BECAUSE it was NOT ala carte. So refreshing.  When you order your entree, you get salads and sides. The salad was wheeled over on a cart and the waiter puts whatever you like in it. Before you get the main course, there was an intermezzo palate cleansing lemon sorbet cone given out as well. Very nice touch. The main course was delicious. We all got filets. Some were wrapped Wellington style but all cooked perfectly. At the end of the meal they put trays of chocolate wrapped strawberries, figs and apricots on the table. We had a memorable, special evening. I would go back any time.",

I am not sure whether it is all the tourists in town for the holidays or what . . . but I was probably the most overdressed person in the restaurant - aside from the servers.    We had reservations for 6:30 and were seated immediately.  We ordered escargot for an appetizer, and it was really nice.  It boded well for the meal to come, that's for sure.  The tableside salad - lackluster at best.  The whole thing felt a little uninspired, and it definitely wasn't \"the best\" salad I've ever tasted.  Iceburg lettuce, mushrooms, pine nuts, tomatoes, artichokes, blue cheese ... eh, it was ok.    The sommelier seemed to really know his stuff.  We took his recommendation, and he wasn't wrong about that.  I ordered the beef wellington - medium rare.  It came out medium.  The sommelier advised us that it was, in fact, medium, but that it would take another 20 minutes to get another one .... so I ate half of my medium wellington.  We were never actually offered dessert.  Too bad, because my husband really wanted to try the bananas foster.  We were, however, able to order some cappuccinos, and those did not disappoint.  It took a long time to clear off the tables between courses.  I'm not sure if that was because the place was busy ... or not.  Also, my water went unfilled for a long time; I eventually had to ask the server for more water.  These small oversights do not a first class restaurant make.  All in all, I will go back again, just to see if my experience was an off night.",

It looked like the only decent place to eat, especially after leaving all the good restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip.  Hugo's is located in the basement (cellar) of the Four Queens Hotel.  Once you get through all the smoke and slot machines you are there.   At the bottom of the stairs the lady is given a red rose.  After receiving the rose you are walked to your seat and the rose is placed in a vase until after your meal.  Your seated in a cellar.  The cellar is surrounded by all red brick walls and pictures.  All employees are wearing suites or tuxedos.  You are immediately served a glass of bottled water, given a menu and list of the specials.  Before you receieve your appetizer and meal, there is a man pushing a salad cart.  He will prepare your salad anyway you like.  After you eat your salad you are given your appetizer and than a small scoop of sherbert.  You receive your meal.  After your meal you are given a desert tray with choclate strawberries and a couple of other delights.    Must warn you.  Eat slow.  They serve you a tremendous amount of food.  I ordered scallops, which were cooked perfect!  I have never been more happy with any restaurant.  Be prepared.  I never had a to ask for a single thing.      If you love wine, they have a huge selection.  Salad, Bottled Water and desert tray is complimentary.",

The salad was watery and the dressing tasteless. When the entree of veal came we were both surprised. It looked as if it had been made and reheated. Not appetizing and tasted the same.  Also very expensive. Disappointment.",

The servers are wonderful.  Very attentive and personable.  Our table had the salad tableside service and I just loved this!  We ordered the shrimp cocktail and the prawns were Huge and delicious.  The steaks were spot on and seasoned perfectly.  We had a beef Wellington that was quite good but my first one ever so I personally just didn't like pastry on it.  2 things that kept me from a 5 Star; our bananas foster was over cooked (server on that was new.). And they have swamp cooling so if your there during Aug heat (it was 90 in the evening still) dress light.  But like I said, we will definitely be back!",

I had the rack of lamb and split half and half with a coworker who had the prime rib. The prime rib was tough, not very flavorful and was served between room temperature and warm.  The rack of lamb was pretty good but not great as it was also tough, not very warm and not very flavorful. The dessert tray had chocolate covered strawberries that were pretty green and the blueberry tart was just ok. For the price and having entres that were said by the waiter, were two or their top three items,  I expected more.",

This time we had on jeans and a nice top, still dressy. We were greeted, and seated right away, and our waiter introduced himself and stepped away to let us choose our lovely meal. In the meantime, 3 or 4 others were seated after us (who I noticed were dressed very nice) drinks served, meals ordered, and salad on their table before any action occurred at our table. We finally ordered our food and waited over 10 minutes for 2 cocktails. My husbands was watered down from sitting at the bar so long! The waiter only remembered after I said we were still waiting for them. The crab cakes were delicious, my prime rib was wonderful, but my husbands ribeye was thin, tasteless and full of fat. After we were finished, it took another 10 minutes to get the attention of someone to get a to go box, and another 10 to get the bill. I normally irritate my husband because I am a generous tipper, but not tonight. I felt the 15% I gave was very generous for the attention (or lack of) that we received. I felt like they already decided we were not going to be good tippers and treated us as such from the moment we walked in. It's questionable if we will go back.",

    "text": "I can't even begin to tell you how on point this restaurant is. It would be endless amount of text to read, so let me try to shorten this review.  I've known of this restaurant for years, but never eaten here. tonight I finally remembered about it and off we went.  First, you wouldn't know this place existed unless you probably heard about it word of mouth. If you follow my reviews, have some extra bucks to spend, treat yourself to this luxury, superb meal. You will not be disappointed.  Second, decor. Once you make your way through the smoke filled casino and hundreds of gambling lunatics, you'll find yourself either tip toeing down a small flight if stairs or taking the elevator one short level down to this dim lit, classic feel entrance where you'll be instantly greeted by multiple service people. From there you just wait to be seated. Once you get taken in, you'll enjoy the classic, wooden, dark coat feel the place has, along with clean patrons and great smelling food. you'll walk by a walk in wine cellar that is fully stocked, amongst a sea of tables that aren't on top of each other, I would say perfectly spaced out, then you reach your destination.  I would suggest to instantly ask what the market price is for the king crab. it should average between $90-$105 for the 1lb dinner.   I had ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, wrapped with bacon. also ordered the spinach artichoke dip...let's get on to the food...  first up was wine list. I find myself now looking for some Opus One, which they had 2011 vintage @ $395. Great pairing with dinner, but I wanted 2013 so I passed on the wine. they have a wine handler though that handles any request you might have pertaining to the wine and champagne. pretty awesome.  The spinach dip came quickly. real fresh and delicious, pouring over the bowl it was in. the flavor of the dip was great. had a good taste of cheese with the mixture of the artichoke and spinach. very good.  next came our table side salad. you choose the ingredients you want on your salad, where it's then tossed in front of you with your choice of dressing. again a perfect salad. reminds me of a mix of Lawry's spinning bowl salad with no spin and table side guacamole you would order at a Mexican restaurant. salad was great. no issues there.  next, the waiter handed us lemon sorbet ice cream. this made me chuckle. he said it prepares the pallet for taste. how fancy is that!  so after the dip, salad and sorbet the filet arrived and I was very happy with it. it kind of looked like a baseball steak with how big it was, but it was all filet mignon, wrapped with a juicy slice of bacon..can't go wrong. when I cut into this meat I couldn't believe how perfect it was cooked. the outline of the cook compared to the red was flawless. Once I dove in, I just kept going at it non stop until I hit something...a bunch of crab meat! I completely forgot there was crab stuffed into the meat! was like getting a little bonus for eating this delicious steak.  after the dinner, your treated to more goodies. a chocolate dipped strawberry with some dipped fruit. then they offer you dessert, but it's not needed. you should be completely satisfied by meals end.  look, once I finished what I could, I was left fully satisfied, 10/10, no complaints at all...and I tried to keep this short with this review.  all of the staff is ultra friendly and courteous from the hostess to the servers to the runners. no issues at all with them.  check out the picture. I don't usually take photos but this dish deserved to be archived with the rest of the photos on here to show what this place has to offer.",

It's prepared table side with whatever you want on it. Very large portion for a dinner salad as well. Another yelper said the ranch was gross but I think it was good and I'm picky about dressing. I wouldn't say the steak was the best I've ever had but it was very good, cooked perfectly and on par with the price. I also like the little dessert platter. Everything tasted great and the portion was perfect. Definitely recommend and would return",

The dirty martini my mom ordered came with an additional ice bucket and with a small glass filled with pretty much the equivalent of three martinis total. The lamb my husband ordered was awesome as well as the steak I ordered. The salads were so yummy. The kids loved the mini lemon sorbet cones and when we asked for more the waiter quickly go us more. The portions are big and the amount of food offered was too much for us but we gladly took left overs home! Loved the experience here. It is pricey, so we will save this place for special occasions.",

    "text": "It was our 5th wedding anniversary and we had just renewed our vows at Vegas Weddings. The woman who officiated our wedding recommended that we go here for our anniversary dinner because it was one of her favorite date night restaurants with her own husband.   Upon arrival we were told that they generally are booked with reservations but they were still waiting on two people who had not shown up, we elected to hang out at the bar and have a drink to see if they did. While waiting the gentleman asked if we were celebrating anything special to which we replied it was our anniversary and we had just renewed our vows. He congratulated us and sat us a few minutes later.   When you are taken back to your seat they give every female a single long stemmed rose. The restaurant itself is very intriguing, it's like you're stepping back in time to the mobster days. Its very dark and mysterious. It was also very romantic. Our server and busser were very attentive. We never went without water or anything we needed.   They have a sommelier which is really neat; I typically don't patron restaurants with a sommelier so my husband decided that since it was a special occasional we would splurge and let him pick out some wine for us. It was a fun experience although pricey.  Included with your dinner is a salad that they made at your table. The server brings out a cart with what seems like endless options. Before you get your main course they bring you a small ice cream cone of raspberry sorbet to cleanse your palate. It was soooo good, so I ate the entire thing haha. Who doesn't love desert before dinner? I ordered the Filet Mignon and my husband had the Rib-eye. Both were cooked perfectly, were very tender and flavorful.   After dinner they brought us out a complimentary dessert, the Lava Cake, to celebrate our anniversary. It was very decadent and delicious!   Overall this was such an awesome experience. The food and service were excellent. The restaurant itself is very intriguing and romantic. It made the perfect place to celebrate our anniversary.",

Prepare to be pampered from the moment you make your way down a short flight of stairs and enter Hugo's Cellar. We had such a marvelous evening celebrating our 30th anniversary.  Hugo's had the right amount of baby boomer nostalgia with waitstaff in tuxedos and elegant 70's deco.  Diners today will love the experience of having tableside service of some of their dishes and desserts. Hugo's is one of the very few restaurants that still carries on this tradition since 1976.  --Highlights -- -all entrees include steamed veggies, choice of potatoes, or wild rice, finished off with strawberries, figs and apricots dipped in chocolate.  -Entree dishes: something for everyone. Various cuts of steak prepared, seafood, duck and chicken. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hugoscellar.com%2Ffiles%2Fmenu.pdf&s=a88825250949f8c0ea74c2be15ee81f1615ea5c29d2e387d1b4528fb505639fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hugoscellar.com/files/me...</a>  -basket of breads and cheese lavosh with a plate of butter carved out in shape of a rose is brought out as soon as you are seated.   mini ice cream cone with Raspberry sorbet serves as a palate cleanser after salad/before main meal   -Salad Made Tableside Server wheels their cart over to you and custom makes your salad.  Of course I got the works with Bay Shrimp, artichokes,  and about 8 other toppings with romaine lettuce.   Beef Wellington is what I ate!  Loved it!  A VERY tender beef filet garnished with Foie Gras and duxelles wrapped up in a puff pastry, paired with a bordelaise sauce!  -Dessert after main meal if you order Cherries Jubilee, it's made table side, with a little fire show even.  Cherries, cherry liquor flambe'd served over vanilla ice cream. I would get this again!   Get Hugo's Cappuccino with brandy and coffee liquor. It actually worked out perfect having it with the complimentary chocolate cake that Chef sent out for Happy Anniversary wishes! Thank you!   When it comes to service. Impressive. It's well known that most of the original waitstaff since early '80s still works here. One of our servers Jaime, has been there the second longest time at 31 years, Michael, 14 years and the new kid on the block (I didn't catch his name) was 7 years!    --More 411-- -  dress code not enforced but stay classy and leave shorts, tanks, and sandals at home.  -  reservations a must! so call..Monday eve was packed -  plan on spending 2 hours - dinner is slow paced -  Your red rose is wrapped up in foil for you to take home  -  they'll validate your ticket for both valet or self parking -  I thought spending a little over $200 for 2 meals, desserts and beverages was pretty reasonable.   --Summary-- After having dining experiences at well known Michelin star and celebrity chef restaurants in Vegas, I'm so over it, doesn't impress me anymore. This time I wanted a place that had good food that we both would like, classy and unpretentious. You see hip, trendy restaurants come and go with a blink of an eye. Not Hugo's Cellar! It has withstood the test of time. Happy we celebrated here. Couldn't ask for a more perfect evening with my hot date.",

Expect a romantic atmosphere--- dimly lit cozy tables--old style service with personable waiters who have been there for years--complementary long stem rose for the lady- low music- great food. Relax, unwind, snuggle up and prepare for a feast! Make reservations and request a private table in the back and soak it all in.   Worth it?  Yes! Tableside salad; perfectly cooked steaks and sides; tableside cherries jubilee; Kona coffee brewed at your table--- this place it sure to sweep you off your feet. I felt like I was transported back to the 'Old Vegas' days. It's pricey. However, it was worth every penny and I'm confident you will be swept away in the whole dining experience and romantic atmosphere. This spot is a classic  treat-yo-self kinda' place! Loved it and I can't wait to treat out of town clients, family and friends to this spot!  Service:  Victor was our server and he was great! He was attentive but he never hovered. My husband and I were all smiles while he perfectly crafted our salads and kept good conversation. We never once had to ask for anything and he was on top of his game.    Overall: This was my first time experiencing an \"Old Vegas\" style dinner. My husband knows I'm a foodie and planned a special evening here for my birthday. We went all out and ordered steaks, cherries jubilee, Kona coffee and we had our feast and plenty of leftovers (photos and video included). I was 'wowed' and enjoyed my night out. All of this doesn't come cheap (expect 100 a person if you're going all out). It was worth every penny and is worth checking out for your own 'treat-yo-self' night on the town.",

They also give a long steamed red rose to every women. It's a very nice touch. Overall, Hugo's is very old school. Dim lights, great service, and an all male waitstaff. I thought they should have had some ladies. Only problem with Hugo's was the price. Because we just went there on a whim, we  look up the menu beforehand. That's our fault, but damn I wish we had looked. Entrees were at least $50 a pop. They were really good but we had been the another steakhouse on the strip earlier that weekend and prices were not that high. Hells kitchen is where we went before. I got the filet and it melted in my month. Portion was huge. My sister in law got the duck and they flambed it table side! Very fun to watch and it smelled amazing!  Overall I would go back. It's a unique old school Vegas experience.",

The women are greeted with a beautiful long stem red rose and you are treated like you are the only people in the restaurant. The food is great, but that is to be expected. The sommelier is knowledgeable and charming. The servers are quick, attentive and unobtrusive. I highly recommend the restaurant. The only criticism I could make is that it can get a little smoky from the casino above. Well worth every penny and will definitely do it again.",

First of all, we were late for our reservation because my date had a corporate gig run late, and they were extremely accommodating and friendly about it!  When we arrived, I got my fresh, beautiful, red rose (all ladies who come here receive one), and were seated immediately.  We had a few different servers attend to us - one for wines, one for our salad, and another for the rest of our needs.  I was blown away by the romantic setting, incredible service, and the impressive food!  As a vegetarian, your options are limited here, but never fear!  I had the vegetarian entree, which changes by the day.  When we went, it was mushroom ravioli, and oh wow.  It was SO good!  They were out of the raspberry cheesecake when we got to dessert, so we chose the berry tarte instead... I'm glad they were out of the cheesecake, because we wouldn't have gotten to try it otherwise!  (There are no words for how good it was.)  Everything about this experience was extremely positive.  It is on the tad pricey side, but if you want to really give a woman a romantic evening, this is the perfect place to go (unless you're vegan or a raw foodie, that is...).  Thank you Hugo's Cellar, for a lovely evening!",

I think that they were training new people because we had a minimum of four people hovering over our table at all times. The salad was good but the meat was mediocre. The lamb was flavorless, and i don't know how that was possible. The ribeyes were ordered medium rare and medium. They were both the same and had gristle that I've never seen in that cut. It was like Sizzler. For $400.00, I expect more.",

    "text": "I love old school Vegas places, so I've obviously had Hugo's bookmarked for a while, and finally visited last night. First, the setting: downtown, in the 4 Queens, so you get the full 'vintage' feeling that I think is kinda lacking at Piero's or Golden Steer. Of course, the Four Queens has pretty much moved beyond 'vintage' to 'dated and smoky', so luckily the restaurant is located literally in the cellar, away from the nastiness of the casino. Second, the ambiance: all brick walls with old paintings everywhere. The furniture is newer, but definitely not modern. I think they could probably spruce things up a little without losing the feel of the place. For instance: 1970s glass lamp shades shaped like flowers.  Third, the service: perfect. Friendly, prompt, knowledgeable. All over it with our water refills and busing our dirty plates, but I never felt like they were hovering. I loved that the sommelier came around to chat with everybody, and he was great. Very approachable, explained things to us without being snooty, and definitely did not scoff at our price point. I love love love that the sommelier has been there almost 30 years, the busser 15 years, and the waiter 15 years.  Fourth, the FOOD: great. We started with the escargot, which were rich and buttery just like they should be. We each had an order of 6, but I wished we would have split because I was already getting full! Moved on to the salad, which many people have described. It might be nice if one of the offerings was just 'make me a caesar salad,' but I appreciated all the options. All the ingredients were fresh and plentiful. For entrees we had the sea bass New England style, and the beef wellington. Both were delicious, but I thought the wellington really stood out. Both the beef and the pastry were cooked perfectly and the sauce added the perfect flavor. Also, the meat was so tender, not a bit stringy like I expected. Finally, topped it off with the chocolate dipped fruits which were a nice tough. It was so much food (and we didn't even touch the bread basket), that we each brought home at least half of our entree. Finally, the damage: $250. Fine dining salads, appetizers, entrees, mini desserts, a bottle of wine, and tip. Totally worth it. I wouldn't mind stopping back by for a martini at the bar when I'm in the area sometime.",

You go down the stairs descend into a totally different world from the casino above. The brick walls and dark intimate feel of the restaurant are in total contrast to what is going on above you. Once downstairs, you are greeted by the manager as soon as you arrive and shown to your table.  The waiters here all wear tuxedos and it gives the restaurant a real elegant feel. We had no less than 3 waiters during our dinner. All were very professional and delivered great service. We did not have any issues during our meal.  We did not order any appetizers because they already give you so much food included with your meal. For starters, they bring you a bread basket with assorted breads in it. All were very good and tasty. We very much enjoyed the table side salad. It was terrific. Presentation was nice and they have so many ingredients to choose from. All items were fresh and it made for a great salad.   They brought us out a little raspberry sorbet cone before our entree as a pallet cleanser. It was a nice touch and did what it was supposed to do. My entree tasted fantastic after eating this tart little treat.  For entree I had the 16oz prime rib. It was very good. Nice and juicy and full of flavor. Served with great horseradish sauce, vegetables and garlic whipped potatoes it was a very nice dish. My wife had the chicken champignon which was very good as well. Loaded with mushrooms and served with a tasty sauce it was good.  After your meal, you are brought a plate of chocolate covered strawberries, apricots and figs with a dip. This was a great touch to a wonderful meal. We were both full from our dishes but ate these little gems anyway. A lot of restaurants could learn something about customer service and service from Hugo's Cellar.  Our whole dining experience from start to finish was great. I will definitely be returning here next time in Vegas for another wonderful meal.",

Request a room in the front area if you're like me a like a little more noise filling the room (though it's still not much), the back room is kind of boring in my opinion.",

Was expecting an intimate quiet dinner based on reviews but almost had to shout to speak to my husband who was right next to me.   The service was very nice and prompt, even for a busy Saturday.   I ordered the jumbo stuffed prawns and my husband ordered the ribeye. Both were overcooked but still very flavorful. Salad was excellent. Chocolate covered fruit (figs, apricots, strawberries) were to die for and included with the price.   Good meal but probably wouldn't go back again.",

    "text": "I chose this place because of the positive reviews. Either everyone else has really different standards, somethings has changed or some of these review are, well, maybe inflated?   Any way here is a list of the good, the bad and the ugly:  Good:  The ambiance* The martinis* The salad The server pouring water The seared prime rib  Bad: 1) The table-side manner. The waiter who greeted us (Jaime) was clearly in training as another waiter (Greg) was visibly agitated by whatever he believed Jaime wasn't doing correctly and it was awkward for everyone.   2) The timing. There were two of us, the place was calmly busy, and yet we were seated at a place with 4 settings and had one of the other waiters reaching across multiple times us as they removed each fork, knife, napkin, etc.   3) The training. Jaime showed how green he was when I told him I was considering the Ahi Tuna. He said it could be prepared the three ways the menu described. Hmmmm, I pretty sure you are not going to have your ahi tuna steak breaded or any of the other ways listed. More training needed before being on the floor.  4) The seating. I've waited tables for 7 years and you don't seat a new waiter with three tables back to back, especially at a labor intensive restaurant like this.   5) The host. One skill a host should have is being good with faces. We checked in a bit early and the waiter said to come back at our exact time. Since the bar was very tiny, we went back upstairs until the exact time. He had no idea who we were when we came back 15 minutes later.   7) The seafood. The second waiter (Greg - too agro, not the right personality for a waiter) came over and so I asked him if the Ahi was good. He said no. Points for being honest. He suggested the $54 Chilean Sea Bass instead. Given that the only other seafood item (I don't eat beef) of interest was the $85 King crab legs, and I usually love Chilean Sea Bass, I went for it. He said it came with a \"shrimp sauce\" on top. I asked for it on the side because why ruin a $54 fish entree with a sauce? This ended up being by FAR the WORST Chilean Sea Bass I've ever eaten. I see why they have you pour a very thick cream \"shrimp sauce\" on top of it. It didn't taste remotely like Sea Bass. It seemed like it had been boiled in water for an hour and then pan seared. It was total mush and completely flavorless. It was served with red potatoes which were also pretty flavorless. THIS was the #1 seafood recommendation?!?  8) The timing - when Greg had told me not to go with the Ahi, I asked for another minute to take a look at the menu. Then no one came back for about 20 minutes so we could finish ordering. We finally got our salads after being there an hour (we did not get apps) because Jaime was busy making salads for other tables ahead of us, which why I mentioned #4.   9) The bathrooms. There are no bathrooms in the restaurant, which is subdued and dim like a steak place should be. So you have to go up into the blaring loud casino and walk quite a ways to the bathroom.  10) Attention to detail. My martini was served in a glass with a big crack down the side and I had to request a new glass. I didn't realize olives could age, but these \"green\" olives were nearly colorless and seemed to have also lost their olive flavor. We were also not given wine menus and had to ask for them. The waiters also did not refill our drinks when they were empty.   11) The bread. There were 3 types of \"bread\" in the basket. One tasted like a giant, very stale, almost moist, saltine cracker. The other two were super cheap little rolls you would get at a Sizzler buffet.   12) Honesty. I already had an issue with this given the low-quality of food they are serving for the 5-star prices, but another thing that was directly misleading was that they say on the menu they serve bottled water. Yes, it comes out of a large glass container with a screw top that is I suppose technically a bottle, but it's clearly refilled tap water. And - there is no ice in the drinks so plan on warm water with your meal.   If we were not there to celebrate my husband's birthday, I would have addressed these items in person with a manager.   My takeaway is that this place is trying to get by with an \"old school\" steakhouse vibe and not even trying when it comes to a good wait staff, quality food or the kind of attention to detail that should be second nature for what they are charging.",

I think any woman would feel special if her significant other took her here for dinner. The food is spectacular.  Last night we had the spinach artichoke dip, which was so divine. Our salads were made fresh table side. We all got to choose our own toppings and our dressing. I had the peppercorn dressing and it was delicious. I chose queens lobster for my dinner. It was medallions of lobster and a delicious sauce with sun-dried tomatoes. I really enjoyed it. It came with vegetables, too. The portions are quite large. Between our courses, we were given sorbet on a tiny cone. It was a delightful touch to clean your palate. I also want to note that they serve chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots with fresh whipped cream for dessert. We also ordered creme brulee and chocolate mousse and everything was absolutely delicious. We truly enjoyed everything about this place and would give it 10 stars if we could!",

We were seated in a nice booth in the back and although it was a Sat night, it was not a full house.  The waiter was nice enough, except he only showed up about every 15 minutes.  We waited several times for drink refills and clearing of dirty dishes.  About those drink refills; the sodas that were ordered came in 8 ounce small bottles, at $2 per refill.  It has been forever since I saw a soda bill that was more than the alcohol bill.  The appetizers and salads were good, my steak, however was luke warm.  Overall, I would say a fair experience at best for this visit.",

The martinis are served in a little carafe and made to perfection by Dean. I have enjoyed every entree I have ever had....from beef wellington to prime rib to steak to salmon. The waiters make your salad tableside which is a nice touch. For dessert the bananas foster is incredible, especially when made by Victor.

It is in the basement of the old Four Queens casino in downtown Vegas, but do not underestimate the amazing food, service, ambiance, and overall experience you are in for at Hugo's Cellar!   The salad is something to behold. They actually bring a cart to your table with about 20 different items and make it fresh for you at the table. The steaks are huge and I recommend always getting the smallest cut. The restaurant is pricey. We go here only for special occasions when in Vegas or if we win big!   You can't go wrong with the Prime Rib or the Filet Mignon. I haven't ever tried a fish dish as the steaks are so delicious I can't being myself to try something new.  If you want the True old school Vegas experience I highly recommend Hugo's Cellar. Make sure to make reservations well in advance as this is a favorite restaurant with the locals.",

Looked at the menu while I was home making plans and had my heart set on chateaubriand - just love a good filet with bearnaise no matter what chefs think of the cut - and looked forward to it.  Was given a red rose upon entering...not my thing...too cheesy for me but I took it (and left it on the table).  After ordering, the salad cart was wheeled over and our salads were created.  Old school salads, nothing frou-frou here and teeney-tiney shrimp.  I made the mistake of filling up on it too much since we were famished upon entering, so much so that I was full when my entree was served.   It was okay but nothing like I was hoping it would be.  Portions were large so come hungry.    This was too old-fashioned for me with mediocre food.  I realize I sound like an idiot saying I'm looking for classic Vegas and being picky when it's old-fashioned, but Hugo's Cellar didn't provide the scrumptious meal I was hoping to have.",

And while you are there, Hugo's Cellar is a must-taste. Our waiter told us that the Rat Pack used to be regulars. The place really feels like a cellar with a 60s or 70s vibe which I completely loved. I hope they never modify or revamp the interior because it is retro and priceless. Also, they give a rose to the women as they come in, and another when you leave! So classy! I had the Filet de Bouef Atlantis and it was seriously worth every calorie and fat gram it may have contained. It was probably the best steak I have ever had in my LIFE. Wrapped with bacon, in a sauce with crabmeat-it was so tasty that I could not believe my taste buds. I am not to one to \"eat it and tweet it\" since I find it rude and obnoxious when people can't put their phones down long enough to be courteous to others at the table, but I do wish I had taken a picture of my filet because it is one of my fondest memories of Vegas (and there are many; it was a great trip!). Our reservations were made in advance but I think you have to get them pretty early, so I would recommend making them WELL in advance if you want to go. Don't miss Hugo's!",

Made my way down the stairs into the dark \"cellar\" flanked by three handsome gentlemen (my daddy, my bf, and his dad) and got my red rose....wore red shoes to match the rose! :) We were seated and got our complementary mountain spring water and bread....I got a glass of Riesling to accompany my meal. My favorite part of the meal was the individually tossed salads tableside...I think I can come back here just for that.  I had romaine with egg, mushroom, tomato, anchovy, bay shrimp, artichokes, hearts of palm, crouton, parmesan, maybe a few other things I can't remember, and honey-walnut vinaigrette.  soooo good!!! ~raspberry sorbet intermezzo was tasty~ I ordered tournedos Hugo.  2 5-oz filets topped with foie gras and artichoke in bernaise sauce, came with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, baby carrots, white and green asparagrus, and sauteed mushrooms.  The foie gras was not my favorite, too pasty and no crust or juiciness like at Rosemary's.  In fact, it was barely on the second steak.  The artichokes here, unlike in the salad, were tough to eat.   However, the filet was amazingly tender and the sauce delicious.  I gave my leftovers to my bf (aka disposal), as did my dad (he ordered the 16 oz ribeye).   Dessert: chocolate dipped figs, strawberries and apricots with cream dip were soooo yummy!!!! In conclusion, great service and probably a place you go once or twice in a lifetime!  So in Hugo's honor, I made an interesting salad for lunch today. My rose is in a water-bottle-vase that I made, but the fun was walking around all dressed up in the Four Queens holding it and I looked stunning (with the red shoes of course) and watching my dad win at craps.",

Steak quality was great but needed a little more seasoning.  It comes with sauce on the side, however, I prefer no sauce.  Butter, garlic and salt is all that I need on a steak.

    "text": "\"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.\" - Steve Jobs   This was my third visit to Hugo's Cellar. I first came to Hugo's back in 1994 for my Junior Prom in high school. I came back a few years later around the turn of the millennium. This final visit was with my love and a couple of our best friends, as we needed a place to eat before seeing the Las Vegas Philharmonic at the Smith Center and felt like the charm of Hugo's might go nice with the evening. \"Old School\" comes up in 92 other reviews...for good reason...this most recent experience matched my old memories of Hugo's pretty well. In fact, as we spoke to Gene the salad guy and John the sommelier, I realized that some of the staff had been there for all three of my visits.  You come to Hugo's for a different feel. This is a traditional steakhouse, void of modern nuances, but with character and flair of a different era. Hugo's is a traditional place, especially for those of us born from the late 60s to the early 80's, because it has held fast to elements of charm and service that are unique. At Hugo's you will find a sommelier with wit and charisma in John, table-side salad from the refined skills of Gene, and service that continues to impress in yesteryear kind of way...such as raspberry sorbet from a miniature cone and table-side Cherries Jubilee for dessert.   You can easily enjoy better food in Vegas at this price point, but it won't come with the same feel. Hugo's has a classier feel than old-school counterpart Golden Steer, and is significantly better than the other old Vegas classic that is Pamplemousse Le Restaurant.",

My love made a reservation here before our Smiths Center engagement...convenient location, with 4 1/2 stars on Yelp Reviews...sign me up please!  I was greeted with a red rose and accompanied by three handsome gentleman...how can a girl not be over the moon already?  Two of our friends had arrived just ahead of us and were already sipping on old fashioneds...I am not an expert on cocktails by any means but these old fashioneds were not the best I have tried.    All the staff at Hugo's Cellar, from waiter to the sommelier, John, were friendly and professional with a welcoming manner. John was wearing a small metal bowl to taste all the wine he opens for the night...what a lucky guy with such a pleasant manner. We were already in an incredible mood when Gene, the Salad-mixologist, topped it up with this engaging preparations...he's been working at Hugo's Cellar over 3 decades...patiently and kindly aqurairing our preferences for the table-side salad making. He offered three different house made salad dressings, as wells as anchovies, hardboiled egg, lettus, shrimp, onion, mushroom, tomato, croutons, blue cheese, parmesan cheese, hearts of palms, pine nuts...Gene literally brings out a cart full of ingredients and asks for your likes and dislikes. Then, he prepares and mixes it right in front of you...very freshly special.    Before our entree, we received a Raspberry Sorbet cone to cleanse our palettes. For the entrees, my love and I shared the Trio of Seafood, and a Filet mignon.  The seafood came with sweet potato, white and green asparagus, stuffed tomato, Crab cake, Shrimp, and Sea bass...the taste was all alright, but the presentation was lacking in some parts. Our Filet was cooked perfect for our request, and came with mashed potato, asparagus and a duo of mushrooms...it all tasted average. We also received a complementary dessert tray with chocolate covered strawberries, dark chocolate covered apricots, and figs with white chocolate...there were all good but not so stimulating as to promise our return visit...but we loved Hugo Cellar's wine selections and services from the beginning to end...   I am grateful to Hugo's Cellar for keeping the old Vegas setting...adoring the ladies with a red rose, and the authentic service...but not so much for the food and presentation.  - 2017 Review #7 -",

I've eaten there 40 years ago when I lived in Las Vegas in it was great & this is even better than my recollection of a back then.   It was 5 stars then and it's actually...  don't have enough stars this is a 10 star restaurant for food and service just spectacular. Thank you Hugo's for be in there.

During the time we looked at the menu, a server arrived with a bread basket.  Two of us decided to split the escargots en croute and I ordered the 10 ounce NY Strip steak done blue.  When the server came with the escargots, he cautioned us that the cast iron was very hot and we should let the escargots cool a bit so as not to burn ourselves.  As he was saying that, one of the escargots decided to \"blow off steam\" and it exploded out of the pan onto my sweater along with some garlic butter.  I took the snail and put it on my plate.  Our server removed the plate and brought me a clean one.  We all had a good laugh.  He was correct, they were very, very hot.  They're really not en croute--rather, they're topped with a piece of puff pastry.  My recommendation would be to put the pastry aside on your plate, eat the escargots, and then use the pastry to soak up the garlic butter remaining in the small wells.  When our server cleared these dishes, he told us he mentioned to the chef what happened and there would be something extra at the end of the meal.  Then he brought the salad cart and one by one made the salad according to each person's desired items and dressing.  I was a bit disappointed that bleu cheese was not an option so I opted for the ranch and he put extra bleu cheese crumbles on top.  The salad was good and it certainly is an old school way of doing salad.  In between the salad and the main course, we were brought lemon sorbet in a miniature cone as a palate cleanser.  Nice touch.  The it was on to the main course.  Garlic mashed potatoes or rice were the two choices (there was a third I didn't understand what he said) and I chose the garlic mashed.  There was a small baked tomato and some white and green asparagus.  My steak was cooked properly and was tender.  The vegetables were were good but I couldn't help but think how nice it would be if they had a baked potato cart like the salad one.  What a way to get baked potatoes.  For dessert, we were brought a chocolate mousse cake to make up for the flying snail and the standard tray of chocolate covered strawberries, and some apricots, and figs dipped in white and regular chocolate. Two of us had coffee and we were brought a dish of chocolate sticks, cinnamon sticks, whipped cream, and sugar to go with the coffee.  Service was very good during the meal.  The rose for the lady in our party certainly is a nice touch.  Now that I finally did Hugo's Cellar, I can say it was A-OK but I'm not sure that I would come back again.",

We were having an amazing meal when an other family member popped in and we brought an extra chair over for him. Anyway long story short. The manager literally screamed at us. Let me repeat screamed at the top of his lungs that he would call security and get the fire marshal if our extra guest continued to sit there. Maybe he forgot to take his medication but he came in like lunatic out of nowhere. I didn't get this managers name because he disappeared after the confrontation but he has only been there for maybe 6-7 years unlike the rest of the staff that have been there for decades. Anyway this guy is a total jackass and shouldn't be in any type of management position. He's lucky he left or they would have needed security. I'm 49 and I've been going there with parents since I was a kid and always had an amazing experience. I should note our waiter and sommelier we're fantastic as always but I will never ever step foot in that restaurant again after the way we we're disrespected. That also includes every member of my family. Vegas has many great stake houses in a lot nicer hotels.",

Service was slow from the beginning of the meal till the end. Had to flag down a waiter to refill my ice tea only to be told they were out of glasses...really? Place was only 2/3rds full. What do they do on a busy night? Had to get someone for my wife's refill a few minutes later. Table side salad was a nice touch but it wasnt that great a salad...her pepper ranch was so bland it added no flavor to salad. My vinaigrette was so strong it over powered my salad. The steaks were good...not great. She asked for her filet medium rare and it came out very rare. I ordered my ribeye rare and it was cooked fine but it was just ok. No seared crust, or any real stand out flavor. After our meal was done it took 30 minutes to get the check. Made several attempts to get waiters attention before finally getting it. Again for $180.00 I want to leave happy and we didn't.",

    "text": "Celebrated my Mom's b-day here on a Thursday night. This was on her list of places to try in Vegas so we figured we'd head to \"old town\" for an \"old skool\" dinner. It was busy.... And almost every table was sat.  The Ambiance: Dark colors, Low ceilings, Low lighting Mostly tables, I think they do this to maximize occupancy Would have been better (IMO) if they had big cushy booths along the walls to give it more of an intimate, private type feeling The tables are so close together we might as well be having dinner with the people next to us since we ended up having a conversation with them about entrees and desserts Several times I was bumped by guests passing or by the salad cart... Seriously... if you're going to have salad and dessert carts... make sure there's adequate room in between ALL the tables and chairs so as not to disturb your patrons.   Loud.... Don't try to have a quiet conversation because you won't hear the person next to you.    The Food: Overall.... Very Good, but there's lots of places in Vegas to go for Very Good and Excellent meals, so food alone is not a good reason to go back here. Now if you are staying on / near Fremont street... Yes, this is a very good steakhouse.  The Bread to start... ok...nothing super extraordinary.  The butter served with it was in a flower shape which was nice but it was rock hard.  The Salad...included with your entree order ... made to order, table side.... It's fun to get to pick what goes in your salad and watch it get made right at your table...  You can choose your dressing and if you pick Caesar you can have an anchovy in your salad diced up.  I opted for the orange walnut vinaigrette which was tasty but other than that... it was just a salad.    The Palate Cleanser... included with your entree order..... ours was a lemon sorbet served in a mini ice cream cone.  Very refreshing and fun.  Personally... I like mine served in a long stemmed glass of sparkling wine ... it's classier than an ice cream cone but then I'm a princess and I know it.  The Steaks... prepared perfectly to order and juicy.  The Sides ... included with your entree order.... meh.  Mine came with red potatoes and mixed veggies.... The red potatoes were dry and crumbly...  The mixed veggies were something that looked like and tasted like it was from frozen Green Giant mixed veggies.  My mom opted for the mashed potatoes and they were gummy.  The Bananas Foster... AMAZING!  This is the reason to come here.  In fact, if this restaurant were closer to Henderson, we'd go here just for this as often as we could.  It is sinfully rich and decadent.  (Of course, you have to like bananas and rum.) This dessert is HUGE.  Big enough for 4 people to share.  The preparer (Victor?) was a showman and talkative so he was fun... be prepared for lots of flame and lots of fun when you order this.  The B-day cake.... They provided a chocolate b-day cake for Mom, and it was rich dark chocolate...  tasty and a very nicely presented.  The Dessert... included in the meal... YES, included not extra.... chocolate covered strawberries and white chocolate dipped figs and a side of whip cream to dip.  So.. you don't really need to order dessert.  The Service: Very Polite The Red Rose for each female is a sweet gesture. They have a lot of people seeing to \"your\" needs. There's so much activity in the room with the salad and dessert carts and bread and water attendant and the other patrons coming and going ... that again... it's not a quiet dinner but it is entertaining.  The Price: Pricey but not ridiculous particularly for the amount of food we ordered... and we all took home \"doggy bags\". For 4 people where 2 of us split a half bottle of wine and 2 opted for non-alcoholic beverages... the total with tax and gratuity was about $85/pp.",

Women are greeted with a long-stemmed rose. You're completely transported, until you look around and see the patrons are wearing short sleeved button ups with cargo shorts, the women swearing loudly about how far they can spit.   The service was very friendly, if a little slow. Gives you plenty of time to sit and relax to enjoy your meal, this is definitely a meal you don't want to rush.   The escargot was buttery, fluffy, and so deliciously rich. Be careful, they're hot!  The beef wellington was good, but a little dry. We ordered it medium rare, came out completely medium. In the future I would probably go with one of the signature cuts of steak instead.  Duckling flambe - it's always fun to order things that are flambeed table-side! Was very moist and delicious, would definitely recommend this dish.   Lemon sorbet served in tiny sugar cones as palate cleansers between apps & mains.  Complementary chocolate-dipped strawberries / dried apricots / figs to close out the meal.  Was not expecting much, was pleasantly surprised, and would definitely come back!",

This restaurant is located in the 4 Queens hotel/casino in the downtown section of Las Vegas on Fremont Street. You have to walk through the casino to get to the restaurant. Apparently the ventilation system at 4 Queens is awful because by the time I got downstairs to the restaurant I reeked of cigarette smoke.  Upon entering each woman is given a rose(very nice). The atmosphere is nice, brick walls and an \"underground\" feel. We were seated and our waiter came by for a drink order. They made a customized salad at the table which was very good. For dinner I ordered a NY Strip Steak - medium rare. What I got was practically raw and was very fatty. I would have sent it back but our waiter was no where to be seen. After we'd finished, a different waiter came by to ask us if we needed anything...then someone else bought our chocolate dessert . For the price ($55.00 for steak) Hugo&#39;s was not worth it. I get it that handing out the roses is a thing but maybe it's better to do away with the roses and focus on service and food prep.  There are many great steakhouses in LV...I won't return to Hugo's.",

    "text": "Hugo's Cellar is still the premier downtown classic dining den where continental cuisine is served, and table-side service is the norm rather than the exception.  Ladies still receive a long-stemmed rose, a palate cleanser is offered just before entrees are served, and complimentary chocolate-covered fruits are bestowed in abundance at meal's end.  All I missed was French Onion Soup Gratinee.  Alas, it is not served here.  To begin at the beginning, my party of four enjoyed Cheese-Toasted Lavosh and Sourdough Rolls with rosettes of butter, before some of us shared a very good Shrimp Cocktail.  But only 3 shrimps were presented for $16, along with a nice traditional Cocktail Sauce and a Thousand Island type dressing.  These were followed by an excellent complex salad prepared with a choice of Caesar, Peppercorn, or Honey Raspberry Orange Walnut Vinaigrette Dressing.  I recommend the latter, which was light, flavorful, and interesting with its different fruity notes.  A diner has 20 ingredients from which to pick, including Romaine lettuce, pine nuts, hearts of palm, tomatoes, Parmesan Cheese, shrimp, mushrooms, croutons, anchovies, bell pepper, red onions, and egg.     An Intermezzo of Lemon Sorbet was a refreshing change of pace before we launched into our entrees.  I had an excellent, perfectly cooked medium-rare Fillet Atlantis, which is similar to Filet Oscar, but here the Filet Mignon is surrounded by Crab Claws.  Except the claws were ice cold on arrival.  An offer to flash heat my entree was accepted, and it yielded beneficial results.  On return the crab meat was hot, and the smooth Bearnaise Sauce tasted great.  Mixed vegetables on the plate, including cooked tomatoes, were good, and Boiled Parsley Red Potatoes and mushrooms were very good.  But, based on the little crab provided, I didn't feel it was really worth the additional cost.  While it is not necessary to purchase a dessert, a pyramid of Caramel Chocolate Mousse with sweet Whipped Cream was really luscious.  But it resulted in a few Chocolate-Covered Figs and Strawberries being left behind on their plate.  It is fairly dark inside (It is a cellar, after all!), and the ambiance is romantic.  Service was formal, attentive, and professional.  Food is pricey, but the cost of entrees is discounted 20% for each diner who is age 55 or over and presents a Four Queens Club 55 player's card.  Thus, a Fillet Atlantis that is normally sold for $60.00 is reduced to $48.00 for young seniors.  4-1/2 stars overall, and still very much downtown Vegas's diamond in the rough!",

I decided to take my boyfriend out for dinner to celebrate his birthday & we chose this place which has been in Vegas for 37 years (!) located in the Four Queens casino downtown.   Upon being seated, the host gives every female a single, long-stem perfect red rose which you can place in an individual case on your table.   We ordered the Hugo's Hot Rock Specialty for Two ($36) as an appetizer in which the server brings out a 500 degree sizzling slab of granite. He then cooks chicken, filet, ahi, and shrimp on it & leaves it on your table. It was delicious.   For the main courses, we ordered the Filet de Boeuf- Atlantis ($65) and the rack of lamb ($56).   The Atlantis is a gigantic, thick filet wrapped in bacon & served over lump crab meat with bearnaise sauce. It comes with sauteed mushrooms, mashed potatoes, green & white asparagus (there's white asparagus??) and two crab claws.   The rack of lamb is marinated in olive oil, garlic & Rosemary & served with an Indonesian style sauce.   The filet was tender & delicious. I ordered mine with a bleu cheese crust ($3) which I try to get whenever I eat steak. The lamb was also very good.   All entrees come with bread, table-side salads (try the honey-orange-walnut vinaigrette!) which is the best salad I've ever had, and a sorbet to cleanse your palette before the main course. You also get chocolate dipped strawberries with house-made whipped cream, white chocolate dipped baby figs, and chocolate dipped dried apricots.   Service was good, and for the price, you get a lot of food. We'll definitely be coming back here.",

Unfortunately you have to walk through all the drunken riff raff just to enjoy the restaurant.  Service is some of the most professional, courteous, and attentive group you will find. We never had a need or wait at any point, but weren't hovered over. The house sommelier picked a perfect wine for us and didn't try to sell us on the high side.  In terms of the food, everything was cooked to perfection and timed just right. We never felt rushed or waiting too long for the next course.  For the price, it's on par or a little bit less than other fine steak houses around town.  My only negative is the dress code. Even though my wife and I focused on ourselves it's hard to miss abundance of cargo shorts and t-shirts. Please enforce a dress code!!!",

I gave it to the man friend since it was his bday tho haha the ambiance is nice and really romantic, still can't believe this is located inside the four queens!  I was kind of sick, and the waiter kept bringing out hot water for me for my tea, very thoughtful. My boyfriend had ordered a McCallan 12 year on the rocks and when they brought out the glass, it was FULL! Like when you order a water or soda type of full loll   We ordered the seafood platter for two as an appetizer. It came with Alaskan king crab, poached lobster medallions, and jumbo shrimp. They bring out two sauces and the yellow one was more delish imho. After this, they brought over a table side salad bar and the waiter makes it for you right then and there. We had a guy named Victor and he was very entertaining. After all this, we were brought raspberry sorbets to help cleanse our pallets. I had gotten the 16 ounce ribeye and the boyfriend got the 16 ounce new York strip. They both melt in your mouth. They also bring out complementary dessert- chocolate covered strawberries, figs, and apricots. All good! They had also made a little chocolate cake with birthday balloons written in chocolate for my boo. There was a candle and everything haha  I would definitely come back here again no doubt about it!!",

You get tons of sauces to put on your steak...bernaise, hollandaise, bordelaise. I had flambe'd cherries jubilee for dessert...haven't had that in decades. Their other dessert is bananas foster which we didn't try. You get tableside salad. One price includes a lot of food.

I would highly recommend making a reservation as it is not a huge place and it is pretty popular. The setting is exactly as the name implies-a cellar. So it was very dark but the ambiance was cool. As for dress code, it says business casual but we were in jeans and there were a lot of people dressed casually; that being said, some guests looked pretty snazzy. Women are given long stemmed roses upon arrival; super nice touch. Was the meal the best I've ever had? I would say \"no\". But it was pretty good. What makes this place great is the service. All of the people we interacted with were super nice; jovial but professional. No stuffiness whatsoever. Timing was impeccable which to me is pretty important. The table side salad was pretty delicious I must say.  Toppings include: hard boiled eggs, tomatoes, red onion, artichoke/hearts of palm blend, baby shrimp, anchovies, pine nuts, Parmesan, blue cheese and croutons. Steaks are served with a mushroom ragout and a grilled tomato. I had the garlic mash (I'm not a mashed potato fan and would have preferred baked) and the veggies were a squash medley (delish). For dessert I wanted the Bananas Foster which is prepared for two. I was the only one who wanted it and it was my birthday so they only charged us half. I truly appreciated that gesture. Drinks were strong! No drink menu but they have a full bar so they can make just about anything. With tax and tip we paid about $90/person which included drinks. I would come back for sure.",

After our dinner experience last night, I can see why!      Incredible service; from the salad prepared at table-side to the help with the wine list by our sommelier made the evening special.      The seafood was extraordinary!  The seafood sampler appetizer we shared had large beautiful shrimp, plump lobster medallions and king crab leg meat that was very fresh and tasty.  My wife had the sea bass entree and loved it!  But the best was my prime rib steak.  Hands down, the BEST prime rib I've ever had - perfectly cooked, tasty and almost fork-tender! Outstanding!      The after dinner sweet of chocolate-dipped strawberries, apricots and figs served with homemade whipped cream for dipping was the perfect way to end a perfect meal!        Next time we are in Las Vegas, we will make time to come here again for dinner!",

    "text": "I've been to Hugo's Cellar many times. It's a fantastic place to take friends and family for a special night. That is why I was so surprised at the experience I had on my last visit.  It all started with making my reservation. I had called and a woman named Claire answered. I had asked for an 8:15 reservation and was told they only had reservations for 8 or 8:30. I quickly asked the person going with me what time they would prefer and on the other end of the phone heard Claire say \"come on!\" in an irritated, impatient voice under her breath. I thought it was inappropriate and poor customer service on her part. Instead of saying anything I quickly took the 8:30 reservation and hung up. I was extremely disappointed and let down by what had happened because Hugo's is a place I love to go and I have suggested it to others many times. In spite of all of that we went to our 8:30 reservation as planned.  Once we got there and we're seated not long after an alarm started going off and continued to go off thru the entire meal. I understand that there is nothing they could do about it but not one manager stopped by the table to explain what was going on. Not even our server offered any information. At the end of our dinner he came out with a free dessert but still said nothing about the alarms. It was as if there were no alarms!   Hugo's Cellar is a fine dining restaurant and is not cheap.  For three of us our bill was almost $200 and if I recall correctly there was only one alcoholic beverage on the bill.  I don't  mind paying a premium price but I do expect quality customer service in return and I was very upset about the customer service my guests and I received that night. I will give them another shot because I really do love the atmosphere, the food is great and I understand that things happen and people make mistakes. I just hope they don't drop the ball and my faith is restored in Hugo's Cellar on my next visit.",

Also, although it is expensive, it's a great value when compared to some of the newer more flashy/trendy restaurants.  You definitely don't want to miss the table side salad which is the best salad ever.  I don't think you'll find better steaks anywhere.  I usually get the 10 oz. fillet, but last night I got it wrapped in bacon served on top of crap meat...spectacular.  The table and wine service are definitely 5 stars and so is the food.

Most places ask if we have ever eaten there n introduce or give suggestions - none was done. Both of our servers had no personality at all. When we ordered I know you get to choose your sides and server just walked away before I could say. My husband n I both ordered filet n shrimp. We ordered our filets medium. I know meat shrinks but this came out half the size of a card deck and the 3 shrimp were very small. The whole plate was covered in this sauce/ gravy. We had the crab cakes that were decent. Bananas foster for dessert- it was so so;( I know the restaurant is old in a casino but if you don't like the constant smell of cigarette smoke like me, you will not enjoy smelling it while you eat . Our main meals was not worth $58 each...We had one app to share n dessert . No wine or alcohol... Our bill was $200.

    "text": "The name of this place makes no apologies: Hugo's Cellar in a word (or 2) is a complete representation of '70s fern bar mentality. This is old school Vegas, baby, and don't forget it. Hugo's is situated within the bowels of the Four Queens casino, located smack dab in the middle of the Fremont Street \"Experience.\" The Four Queens is a retro-New Orleans style place. No need for pirate ships, mock Parisian towers and the like - gambling is the focus here with good food (at Hugo's) an added benefit.   Once you make your way past the slots, check-in area, and cashier, you walk down a set of stairs to Hugo's. It is a throwback to another time - red brick walls, large hair on the hostesses, and lots of flambe-food prepared tableside. I arrived an HOUR early (my fault - I'd driven in from Utah and didn't set my watch back an hour) and had to wait at the small bar area. The bartender brought me a portion of pate which was nice. I finally sat down for dinner which was very good - but not great.   Good things about Hugo's Cellar: - Retro Vegas subterranean fern bar decor; - Good wine cellar with selection of half bottles; - Delicious Filet and Shrimp aux Poivre; - Hugo's Tableside Salad - you get to pick the stuff! - Cheese Lavosh! (kosher?)  Bad things about Hugo's Cellar: - Need a guide with GPS to find the place in the hotel; - Elderly hostesses seem a bit 'uncaring;' - Side dishes bland; - Service efficient but impersonal; - Valet parking pretty slow.  I'd go back to Hugo's Cellar if I wanted a 'break' from the mega-restaurants on the Strip that are named after famous chefs (who rarely, if ever, cook in their kitchens). I'm glad I found Hugo's on Chowhound - I think it is normally 'locals only'. Worth checking out. Major yang decor with low fu design. Wear a tux with ruffled baby blue shirt to feel 'connected' to ghosts past in this place. Check it out. 4 stars.",

    "text": "A friend recommended Hugo's Cellar and since I was staying at the Four Queens Hotel anyway, decided to try it.  Well worth the experience. It's miles apart from the noisy, packed casino floor.  It's more like the old school top notch Vegas restaurant, not a chain, outstanding steaks, service and ambiance.  I was not dressed in a suit, but was not treated any differently because of it.  The salad table-side was wonderful, and my steak and shrimp combination outstanding. The whole experience was one I recommend. Too many of the Vegas restaurants are chains, over priced and cater to well-heeled tourists. I would imagine that this hidden gem has been here for years and will be here for years to come.  Don't let the low budget tourists on Fremont Street deter you.",

I ordered the duck which was good, but nothing spectacular. I wonder if I was supposed to order the steak here?? No clue. The tableside salad thing was kind of cool, I like how they mix it right in front of you. Extra stuff always gets me excited. :)  The free dessert is always a plus as well.   As for the service... WAY grouchy! Everyone that worked there just looked absolutely miserable. Maybe I should have given them my free rose. Cause they needed a bit of cheering up! :) :)",

My dirty martini was pretty damn good and so was the bacon wrapped filet mignon served on crab legs along with garlic mashed potatoes. Oh yes, I almost forgot, the table side salad. Our salad maker, I think was named Kenny? made a great salad and I had every damn topping short of onions that he offered.   The only thing we missed out on was dessert but time was an issue.

What a romantic, elegant old-school dinner house.  For starters every lady guest is given a rose when they seat  your party.   We ordered crab cakes that were excellent.  For entrees we  ordered fillet Mignon, and stuffed chicken.   The dinner salads are made for you at the table.  You can choose from, artichokes,pine nuts, tomatoes, mushrooms, shrimp,cheese, croutons, etc.... just wonderful.  I must mention their orange honey walnut vinaigrette.  This was the best dressing for a salad that I have ever tasted.  Wonderful.  Now back to the entrees.   My husband had the best melt in your mouth fillet he has ever ate.  He was blown away by how perfect his steak was.  Our chicken was delicious as well.  Nice and tender with an awesome sauce.  We were so stuffed from our meals that we didn't order any extra dessert.  They bring a complimentary dessert to your table.  Chocolate covered strawberries and apricots and I believe dates.  This was a wonderful ending to an unforgettable meal. We all agreed that this was the best attentive service that we have had in ages. We did not want or wait for a thing.  If you are in downtown Vegas and near the Four Queens hotel and casino and want a delicious meal I would highly recommend Hugos.  I wish I could give more stars.",

An aside:  downtown Las Vegas is a lot more fun than I remembered it being.  The people are friendlier, the games less expensive and it's a great way to balance out the chaos of being on the Strip.  The service at the Cellar:  fantastic.  They check up on you frequently if you look confused or just looking for a waiter.  The sommelier led us to a tasty selection.  The atmosphere:  cozy and friendly.  Matt mentioned that it was like being at a great wedding reception.  There's enough privacy between each table, but everyone was close enough to see each other as well.  The food:  great.  The main courses start off with a salad made right at the table.  You get to choose all the ingredients you want as it's made.  I never enjoyed a salad as much as this one.  The steaks were tasty and come with a variety of sauces and topping.  The value:  like most if not all things in downtown Las Vegas, the value is excellent.  We expected to pay much more for this dining experience.",

We celebrated a friend's 25th birthday over the weekend with a party of 11.  From the beginning to the end, the experience was wonderful.  Each female who walked by hostess was handed a long stem rose (very nice gesture).  We were then seated right away and menu was introduced.  Each meal came with a salad which they make fresh at the table.  A cute mini sorbet cone was given to everyone to clean our pallets.  Next came our main course, and boy was it a lot of food!  My friend and I shared the scallops and the 16 ounce prime rib and could not finish our plates!  The scallops were seared to perfection and the prime rib was cooked as ordered.  By the time the chocolate covered figs and strawberries came in time for dessert, I was so full but I tried one anyways because they looked so good!

    "text": "After searching and searching for the perfect restaurant for a group of 11 to celebrate my birthday, I hoped that I had finally found it when I read the reviews for Hugo's Cellar on Yelp.  If you have ever planned a a group dinner, then you probably know what I'm talking about.  The restaurant couldn't be too expensive, it had to serve a variety of food, it couldn't be too far, it couldn't be the same ol' thing, etc etc.  Hugo's was everything that I had hoped it would be.  It was PERFECT.  All the other reviewers were right on the mark when they said that Hugo's is the epitome of old school Vegas.  It was definitely a nice break from the strip.  When we arrived our table wasn't ready yet, but we had no problem passing the time by taking advantage of the low minimums on the roulette tables near by.  Within a matter of minutes, the hostess let us know that they were ready to seat us.  The long stemmed roses given to all the lady's was definitely a nice touch. (To be honest, this is one of the big reasons Hugo's topped my list of where I wanted to eat for my birthday. After all, I am a hopeless romantic at heart and I love it when I receive roses, whether its from a boyfriend or a friend or even a restaurant).   Our waiters (I believe we had 3), were all fantastic.  Our main waiter was hilarious, he had us cracking up the entire night and at the same time, he was extremely attentive, helpful and knowledgeable.  He also noticed that my friend was a little sick and so he had the bartender whip up a special drink that gets rid of that scratchy feeling in your throat. And miracles of miracles, it worked! Now, that's what I call service!  As previous reviews have indicated, a salad, a lemon sorbet to cleanse your palette, and some chocolate covered fruit are all included in your entree price. In my opinion, you really don't need to order an appetizer as the portions are all extremely generous so its already a good amount of food.     The salad in the beginning was great.  A waiter comes around with a salad cart and you tell him what you would like in your salad. It was wonderful to be able to customize your own salad without feeling picky for not wanting this or that.    For the entrees, Hugo's has a ton of variety so that there's pretty much something for everyone on the menu, there's chicken, duck, fish, crab, lobster, etc etc.  For the entree, I took a chance on the chilean sea bass ($36) even though I knew that Hugo's is mainly known for their meat.  The sea bass was FANTASTIC.  Every bite was cooked to perfection and it was extremely moist and flavorful. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  My boyfriend got the 16 oz. prime rib ($38) and that was melt in your mouth AMAZING.  Our friend got the 24 oz. prime rib ($49) and that slab of meat was gigantic, It was a treat just watching him trying to finish that thing.  Because we had 11 people and mostly everyone ordered different things, we got a pretty good taste of the entrees that Hugo's offers.  While everything tasted great, the standouts of the night were definitely the prime rib and the sea bass.    By this point, we were so full after the entree that we almost groaned when they brought out the chocolate covered fruits.  They served us two platters of chocolate covered strawberries, figs, and apricots.  All of these were delish.       The prices aren't what you would define as cheap, but you're in Vegas so that has to be expected.  Plus, for the quantity of the food, quality of the food, the service, the atmosphere, it was definitely worth it.",

    "text": "IMHO, this is about as good as it gets for steak in Vegas.  The only thing Hugo's Cellar is missing is a view of the Vegas Strip, but let's face it, that''s not why I'm here.  It is for the calm atmosphere, the elite service, and the food!    I've dined here twice in three years.  The first time impressed me and made me want to come back.  The second time (last week) made me list Hugo's as my favorite restaurant for a great salad and meat entree.  Both my wife and I agree that the made-to-order-at-your-table salad was absolutely  the best salad we've ever had!  I liked how they brought my cocktail (a gibson) in a small carafe - and it must have been a double - because the extra is stored in a dish of crushed ice on the table  so it doesn't get warm or watered down.  Now that's something very few places do for you.  A classy touch that's worth bonus points.  Other Yelpers have validated that the food - from the bread basket to the chocolate-dipped fruit - is expertly prepared, presented, and tasty, so I won't go into that.  But I would like to compliment the staff.  We had a team of three servers waiting on us, and they were smooth, efficient, attentive, professional and warm.  Combined with the quiet atmosphere, subdued lighting, and luxurious cellar ambience, this is a place that will not disappoint if you're weary of the hustle and noise of the Strip.  To add frosting to the cake, you get a discount on one entree at Hugo's if you have a player's club card from the Four Queens Casino upstairs.  Free validated parking at Four Queens as well!  What more could you ask for on a great dining experience?",

As mentioned before, all women receive a long-stemmed red rose, they even have a vase at the table for you to put it in while you are dining. The maitre d' looked alot like the actor Michael Caine, perhaps a distant cousin??. He was very sweet and welcoming though.   I ordered a steak and the other half ordered duck, that ended up being flambeed tableside. I loved the salads that were made tableside too. I was beginning to feel bad for the guy that went around making each tables salads. He probably felt like a robot. Tomatoes?, anchovies?, shrimp?, blue cheese,? choice of dressing? Our server was wonderful. All of the food was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. All meals come with chocolate dipped fruit and whipped cream, as well. The whipped cream was superb and decadently homemade. They even offer a regular dessert menu, but we didn't get to that because we were simply stuffed.   The only regret I had was that I was not able to bring my rose home on the airplane with me, for fear it wouldn't survive the journey/get crushed. I took pictures of it though.",

A couple of hints to make your Hugo's Celler experience the best... 1. Go a bit early and have a drink at the bar, its old school and you can really get a sense of the place by watching the room and the waiters and the cocktails being made. Martini's are huge and served a fun way. 2. Order the salad cart, it is the most fabulous way to start a meal there. 3. If you drink Iced tea, get it. Its AMAZING I know, iced tea but trust me 4. Wonder around the hotel after and play a little craps or the slots, you will feel like its 1975 if you let it....",

Do yourself a big favor and visit this restaurant, may be your best dinner in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "This was one of my best all-time eating experiences ever!  Flashback 24-hours earlier where my hubby and I spent way too much $$$ at a snooty Strip restaurant (Table 10?) that charged you for every side, had three waiters constantly hard-selling you and served very mediocre food. Screw those guys.  Flash forward to our next night's meal at Hugo's: a classy (70s Vegas classy), pampered evening where we ate the best food of our lives.  Ladies get a rose at the door, the youngest waitstaff have been there for 10 years (some of the guys have been there for 20). You get warmed hand towels, sorbet to cleanse your palette, salads are served up at your table...and the meat--oh the meat--is some of the best I've ever had in my life. I've heard they have an amazing wine selection as well, but we chose to go with some of their martinis which were to die for and plentiful. Sure it's $14 a martini, but they give you a carafe with the extra from the shaker so really you're getting 3 drinks for that price.  Located in the cellar of the Four Queens Hotel on Fremont Street this place screams Old-school Vegas. I was channeling Sharon Stone in Casino the whole time.   No nickle-and-dime---you pay heartily, but you get a lot. It's worth every penny for the ambiance alone. Love it!",

We all enjoyed not only the great drinks but the comedic stylings of Dean....hilarious!!!! Once we were seated, which did not take much time at all, we were greeted by a team, yes, a team of servers that were there for our entire evening. From the warm delicious bread to start, I knew we were in for a culinary treat. Next were the salads, hand prepared by one of the servers, and made to your own specific order, the salads were wonderful. Then we were treated to a raspberry sorbet to cleanse our palates before our main courses were brought to out table. All I can say is the main courses which included Filet Mignon and Crab was over the top AMAZING!!!! Then the final treat was two platters filled with chocolate dipped strawberries, figs, and sliced apricots. WHAT AN EXPERIENCE !!!!!! Great place to dine!!!!",

I was actually worried when we walked into the cheesy hotel that this restaurant is located in, but all fears were tossed out the window when a red rose was given to every woman in our group. They bring the salad cart over to the table so that they can make it right in front of you. Raspberry sorbet is served between dishes to cleanse the palate.

    "text": "This is our anniversary/special occasion restaurant.  It is always a great meal with great service.  Their steaks are delish and the salad that comes with the meal is something I would put on my list of things to eat if I was going to the electric chair.  The meals include salad and sweets (choc dipped fruits and some delish and I'm quite sure the most fattening whipped cream ever) so save some cashola and don't order any apps.  You will be quite full the time the dessert tray comes out.  Our dinners usually range from $120 (no wine) - 200 (with wine) for the 2 of us.  It's fantastic every time....well almost....  This visit was not as good as our other visits because of a bunch of goobers in the back room (we were seated right next to it) being very loud and obnoxious - since when do birthdays excuse you from having manners? The food and service were great despite the mannerless cretins.      If you go, request a booth in the front part of the restaurant.  It  is almost a completely different experience - much more quiet and romantic.    There isn't a dress code per se but there is a sign that says no tank tops, shorts or flip flops.  Well, obvs they don't enforce it cuz the BF and I both had flip flops on and I had a tank on.  There were folks in there in shorts and crap that they just pulled out of the hamper so it doesn't look like they enforce the rules.  PS: The gals get a rose upon entry which you can give to one of the many hobos or unsupervised little kids outside on the FSE.",

    "text": "Our dinner here was THE HIGHLIGHT OF OUR TRIP to Vegas.  You won't be treated with this kind of sincere, genuine kindness and class anywhere else!  Don't let the old casino's cheesy facade and dated interior fool you, this place is top notch.  The ambiance is completely different once you go down the stairs to Hugo's.  They even give ladies a perfect, long-stemmed red rose upon entering the restaurant.  I felt like a queen when I dined here.  Everyone was so nice and friendly and welcoming - the employees, the other customers, EVERYONE.  It was like something straight out of a movie.  Excellent.  Classic.  Amazing service.  Old-school charm.  Some of the best food I have ever had anywhere in the US or abroad.  I had the filet and shrimp aux poivre: the steak was tender, the sauce delightful, the shrimp and steak both perfectly cooked.  The table side salad service was a show in itself - the guy who does it (can't remember his name) was born and raised in Las Vegas and has a wealth of knowledge about its history and funny personal anecdotes to tell if you are the kind of customers who want to hear that stuff (we were!).  It is worth going just to chat with him about old Vegas, Elvis, and the Rat Pack.  The meal and the experience were well worth the price - unlike other places in Vegas the price of your meal includes sides, bread, salad, and dessert (a plate of chocolate dipped strawberries, apricots, and a few other goodies).  You can order a dessert off of the menu, they looked delicious, but we were so full and so satisfied by the complimentary fruit that there was no need.  Drinks were very reasonably priced for a restaurant of this caliber.  The take away: If you have only one splurge dinner in your budget while you are in Vegas, skip the strip and come here.  Seriously, you won't be disappointed.  They've been in business this long for a good reason.",

I ordered the filet mignon medium rare with a lobster tail and the filet was well done and the lobster tail was cooked to the point that it was rubbery. We were seeing a show so we didn't have time to send it back. We also ordered coffee after dinner and told them we were in a rush but despite telling us it would only take ten minutes or took over twenty and we ended up having to rush to our show. The appetizers were nothing that impressed me either; we did the hot rock, the table-side salad, and a seafood starter. Finished with a dessert and the Kona coffee. I was not impressed with my experience at all!",

This second time was just as good until a couple of hours later when my girl friend suffered a serious case of food poisoning, Let me just add that she was so sick that she could not move.  The following day, as a courtesy, she called the restaurant to advise them of what occurred and what she had eaten so that they could check out the food she ate. She did not ask for anything nor did she want anything. A manager, named john answered the phone and NEVER said that they were sorry, but only said they he would refer it to \"risk management.\"  Two weeks later a man named John Navitidad, called my girl friend. It is not necessary to go into a long dissertation on his attitude but the man can only be described as an old complete jerk, since he stated that he has been doing this for forty years. He as much as accused my girl friend of making up the story. She tried to explain to this hostile man that she wanted nothing but to inform the restaurant so that they could check out what she ate but he kept referring to \"her claim.\"  So I would say to future diners, be aware. Obviously they have a defensive attitude about these things that may suggest there are many more complaints.   Visited July 2016",

The waiting area of the restaurant is very personal and looks like a living room.   Upon sitting down you are surrounded  by brick walls and nice art. If you are with a lady she will receive  a rose which will be put on a vase during your meal. All the waitors  are older gentlemen in suits/tux's and most of them had accents that scream old school.   We started off with salads which they make in front of you. It's a real winner. The spinach artichoke  dip was very creamy and delicious. We had the filet and ribeye steaks cooked to our liking and included garlic mashed potatoes. All were amazing! They sometimes throw in free ice cream which is a nice plus.  If you want to try a high end place without the vegas flash (more vegas class) then this is the place for you!",

I don't drink much wine but the wine sommelier's knowledge and presentation was so well done I had to try his recommendation and loved it.      The salad preparation on the cart next to the table was a nice nice touch and all ingredients tasted very fresh.       I highly recommend the \"Hot Rock\" for the appetizer.  It does say \"for two\" on there but we actually shared it 5 ways but we knew we were going to eat a large meal.  It is quite a bit of food for an appetizer.       The main course was amazing.  I had the 24oz Prime Rib.  I have had a lot of prime around the world and this ranks in the top 5. My only thing I prefer is fresh horseradish verses the creamy styled on my prime but that was not a choice I was told by one of the staff so I did not even use the creamy style given to me.  Not a complaint but a preference.  I think a place like this would offer both.     We did not opt for the deserts presented as we were so full but the presentation and the servers description makes me want to not eat as much and try one next time.  Then they bring a complementary assortment of chocolate covered fruits.  As full as we were we could not resist.  The white chocolate covered dates were amazing.    A rose for the ladies was a nice touch as well.      Our table of 5 did not have a reservation till 9:00 pm.  I was a little concerned as sometimes places tend to be a little lax or rushing to closing time in later night service.  This place had the most top not service I have ever seen.  I have been in the service industry for 29 years and kinda watch/pay attention an be a bit critical of staff.  I would not find anything whatsoever that this outstanding staff did.  I wish I remembered everyones name to compliment every individual one.",

I made my reservation the Friday morning before through the Open Table phone app.   We came down the stairway entry to Hugo's to see a dimly lit and beautifully set up lounge area. We approached the host to let him know we had reservations at 9pm, it was only 7pm, but we were hungry and figured what would it hurt to ask.   The host let us know that he would get a table for us right away, it would just be about 15 and we could sit at the bar and have a drink while we waited, so we did.   Just as we finished our Jameson and Ginger Ales, the host came over to let us know our table was ready whenever we'd like to sit down. We followed him over to the host area, were he handed my wife a month stemmed red rose (that all ladies are offered).   (In an effort to avoid tl;dr, I'll cut small details.)  Our waiter, Dave, explained in detail everything that we would receive with our meal then gave us a minute to decide. Some fresh bread arrived, Dave returned and we chose. I went with the 16oz slow roasted prime rib and my wife chose the filet and shrimp prawns.   Our table side salad service arrived, I went with their signature vinaigrette and my wife, the Caesar. The vinaigrette was absolutely wonderful, wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. An orange sweet twist that went very well with the fixings I chose for the salad (which was pretty much everything). My wife's Caesar was good, but not great. Nothing to complain about, have just had much better is all.   Our sorbets came next in order to clean our pallet before dinner. We got another round of drinks, finished our sorbets and relaxed while waiting for our entrees.   When our meals arrived they looked beautiful, prime rib was a perfect reddish pink for my medium rare and my wife's filet and shrimp was much larger then we expected.   One tip, get the garlic mashed potatoes as my red potatoes were nothing special and I need to salt them.   Hugo's was amazing, beautiful, intimate restaurant with a wonderful buzz. Service was incredible and on its game. Food was also wonderful.   I would have given Hugo's Cellar 5 stars but here's why I didn't; my wife and I both had to season our meats. I expected the prime to be so amazing I wouldn't need to reach for the salt, unfortunately I did. Prime rib was definitely not seasoned properly as it came out without much flavor. After some salt and pepper it was incredible.   Overall Hugo's Cellar is an excellent steakhouse experience without the added price of ala-carte. With definitely return and recommend.",

    "text": "I am going to try and make this as short as I can  because I have a lot to say on this restaurant I come to Las Vegas every year for my birthday and I visit the Fremont experienceas  well because the Strip is so pricey.The one downfall is wine! I love Chardonnay so I t sneak down there and get a glass and sit in their little bar but I noticed how darn busy they are and I always would forget to plan to reserve a table.So this year I remembered and we got a early 5:30 time.We walk in you are immediately greeted by the host.You are sat at your table and given a  rose(very nice touch) They hand you menus and you are greeted with water and a waiter.He introduces himself but I notice the busser is a tiny bit nervous.I notice these things because I own a small cafe in Pismo Beach.He gets a drink order and our friends order a cappuccino martini which was surprisingly good.I was a bit surprised they did not have nightly specials.Order is put in and one of the highlights of our night was their salad presentation.Its a presentation I have never seen in my lifetime.A guys comes personally with his cart and his salad bar filled with every topping anyone could ever ask for and takes our order for each salad.We sit there in complete awe.You could of only served that at this point and we would of been happy.So as I said previously that busser who looks nervous misses out on the fact I am dehydrated and I have finished  my water.The waiter comes over and fills it quickly but there is a exchange of looks to him( the nervous busser) that says \" This is you job!\" He does not have to say a word.I feel for this young man but being new is tough in this situation because you have to learn and this waiter is teaching him.I wish I could  have more space to share my whole story but its already going long.They know their stuff.They have a very loyal following.Our meals were tops notch,the dessert was delicious! One last note.I stack my plates and this waiter goes to the busser yet again and says \"When they are stacking their plates that is your cue to remove them.I run a cafe a small one and you have to train your crew the way you want your place run.You can not take shortcuts and I as well demand a lot.This place is a gem.Its is worth every cent and you are genuinely spoiled.I wish our busser luck.Hang in there! All my Best,Penny(Penny's All American cafe)",

Makes me think I'm back in times of speakeasies and mobsters.   All women get roses upon entering. All restaurant should do this. All of them.   I'll admit that this place is somewhat pricey considering it's located in a somewhat ghetto casino on Fremont St., but none the less, it makes a memorable impression.   Every meal comes with a salad that is created for you from an Ingredient cart allowing you to make the salad you want. With ingredients you want to eat. I will say that they have a $25 sharing fee. Slightly obnoxious, but I have a feel people do it more than one would think.   All in all, the food is amazing. The atmosphere is unmatched in Vegas and the service is very attentive. Check this one out if you can!",

I order what I always get, Filet de Boeuf - Atlantis, which is a bacon-wrapped filet served with lump crab and bearnaise sauce. Steak was cooked perfectly & bacon was tasty. I was a little disappointed with the sauce. I got crab meat but not much sauce so everything was dry because of that.  One thing I can't say anything bad about is their salad. It's made to order & you get tons of choices. I absolutely love it every time.   If you've never been, I feel like it should be on a list to do.

Our table of four ordered: two rib-eyes, veal Marsala, tournedos (filets)  I'll start with the good: - The filet was great. - The wines selected with the help of the sommelier were fantastic. - The salad cart was good, as usual, though I think I'm over it.  The bad: - The ribeyes were unremarkable, bordering on unappealing. - The veal marsala was a little chewy, with unremarkable taste. - We waited a L O N G time for the check.  Two of the things that kept me, and my friends, coming back here trip after trip (tasty food and  great service,) just didn't happen this time. The great location and old-school Vegas ambience aren't enough to carry this joint.  Every other visit over the past 10+ years was at least four stars. I wonder if this experience was a fluke, or if it was indicative of something more permanent.",

    "text": "Been wanting to try Hugo's Cellar for years after hearing good things about this place. I'm not a fan of Downtown, so it's very rare that I'll even be in the area. But, we decided to come here for a special occasion - my birthday. The restaurant has a cool, old school Vegas atmosphere and women are greeted with a red rose. It was pretty crowded on a Friday night. From what I could see, most of the tables were full and it was really loud. Service was good, but not excellent. For the most part, the servers were friendly and attentive with removing plates from the table. But they were slow with refilling our waters.  We started with the bread basket, which was nothing exciting. The bread didn't taste too good and although the heart shaped crackers were cute, they were just plain old crackers. Ordered the Spinach Artichoke Dip appetizer and it was sooooo good!! Creamy, full of flavor and delicious! The bread that it came with was warm and had the right amount of softness. I was afraid that I wouldn't like it because of the shallots, which is a type of onion from my understanding. But they either didn't bother me or melted away. This was the best Spinach Artichoke Dip that I have had and the best part of the meal! The table-side salad was good, but they went a little too heavy with the dressing. I appreciate that we got to choose our toppings instead of them just mixing everything together.   Ordered the Filet Mignon for the main course. Yep, I always get the same cut but sometimes you just stick with what you like. For the price, I expected the steak to be much better. It was cooked to my liking and juicy, but not very tasty. Also not a fan of using any steak sauce. My husband felt the same about his Prime Rib. The complimentary chocolate dipped fruit after the meal was nice since I do like chocolate covered strawberries. Wish there were more strawberries or apricots in place of the figs though. They also brought a Chocolate Lava cake for my birthday. Can't remember much about it, but we did eat it all. We also wanted to see their dessert selection and probably would have ordered something, but our server didn't even bother to ask. I guess he assumed that we were fine with the complimentary cake. Oh well, their loss.  It was a good experience and I'm glad that I finally got to try this restaurant, but it's not somewhere that I would dine at again. The hotel is run down and the elevator in the parking garage is scary. Awesome Spinach Artichoke Dip though!!",

They gave us a complimentary desert... or so we thought. Bill was high, they charged us for cocktails that we never ordered and it took them about 20 min to figure out how to take them off the bill.

    "text": "I have grown up with Hugo's Cellars. My first time here was with my high school boyfriend for the prom. I was all impressed when I walked in and they gave me a red rose. Next time was with my parents and then my husband took me while we were dating. This would be my fourth visit.  I was craving a return visit for some reason, maybe because my Dad used to enjoy this place so much and now he has passed on. Anyway, it had been many years since I had been so off we went.   Upon arrival, I was glad to see that they still had the tradition of giving all the women in the party roses. So classy! We were then sat in the main dining room at a small, intimate table for four. If you have never been, the restaurant is dimly light for romance and ambiance. The ceiling is low and I adore the brick on the walls. Our server Oscar had all our roses placed in a vase so we had our own floral centerpiece. The sommelier approached the table and provided his wine recommendation. We then placed our orders. I had ordered a bowl of Lobster Bisque which was really creamy and featured some nice chunks of lobster. I absolutely devoured this bisque. Eric approached our table shortly after this and was ready to personalize our choice of salad from the salad cart. He asked each one of us what ingredients we wanted in our salads. There were many choices such as anchovies, mushrooms, tomatoes, hardboiled eggs, pine nuts, toasted croutons and a choice of dressings. I was disappointed with this cart.  When I think of a salad, I envision, carrots, cucumbers, radishes, garbanzo beans in other words veggies!   Once the salads were finished, we were all brought a small cone of raspberry sorbet to cleanse our palates. This is special touch where I feel Hugo's stands out. Along with the outstanding service that is truly hard to beat.   Onto our entree's. I had ordered the filet and shrimp. My steak was cooked just as I had asked, but was really just ok. I felt the green peppercorn sauce was a little overbearing and took away from the taste of my dinner. My husband had ordered the prime rib and found it tasty but really heavy. My daughter being a non red meat eater,  had the vegetarian plate which was a spinach ravioli and garlic mashed potatoes (odd combo) with a pesto sauce. I saw her take a couple bites but never finished it.   Oscar was kind enough to bring us the dessert tray with chocolate strawberries, apricots and creampuffs. Other than that, no one ordered dessert.  I am not sure why this dinner was just A OK but it was. Maybe it's because we don't eat very much red meat anymore, or maybe we are just over old school steakhouses living in Las Vegas so long and there are so many dining choices. Or maybe Hugo's was just having an off night.  If you have never experienced this kind of dining, than you should try it at least once. For the downtown area, this is a long time favorite and although pricey this place will have you stepping back in time to when steakhouses were where it's at!",

    "text": "I'm giving Hugo's five stars because it feels like you just have to give it five stars.  But I'm doing it reluctantly.  Dine here and you are sure to think, at least once or twice, \"Wow, that's a nice touch.\"  The signature \"nice touches\" include a lovely red rose presented to female guests at the door, the salad prepared table-side followed by a sorbet palate cleanser, and the mini dessert tray with chocolate covered strawberries - all included with your meal.  The room is high end, and the staff is impeccably attentive.  So what's not to like?  Well, I'm glad you asked.  I'll tell you what's not to like, but this is just me - I prefer a restaurant where I can choose my own courses.  Sure, Hugo's has appetizers on the menu and a dessert tray, but the fact that every entree already comes with salad and dessert doesn't leave much room for anything else, unless you are a competitive eater.  For a first course, I usually prefer a soup or hot appetizer rather than a salad.  And frankly, the salad wasn't all that great.  (Yeah, the table-side preparation is a bit of a show, but really - it's not Cirque or anything.)  In an effort to mix it up a bit I did order the cheese plate to follow the entree, and the cheese plate wasn't all that great either.    So, let's talk entrees.  I ordered the Petite Surf & Turn (filet and shrimp).  My wife ordered the sea bass.  Both dishes were perfectly acceptable high end restaurant fare, but neither left us craving a return trip to Hugo's.  Entrees come with potatoes, and we both asked for the au gratin potatoes (extra charge).  Alas, our waiter returned to inform us that they didn't have the au gratin potatoes.  (What does that mean, anyway?  They ran out?  Is there a potato shortage in Vegas?)  So we had the mashed potatoes and, again, emphatically, not all that great.  Not even very good.  At all.  Hugo's is pricey, but because you really don't need more than just the entree the overall tab is not that bad.  Drinks are generous and not overpriced.  I guess they also validate parking, but I forgot to ask.  So the bottom line is that if you like Hugo's all-inclusive approach to dining, you will like Hugo's.  If (like me) you prefer to go your own way with an a la carte menu, you might not put Hugo's at the top of your list.",

He immediately made reservations at Hugo's cellar. And I'm so glad he did. It's intimate and old vegas. The service is UNMATCHED. David and Michael were our servers and they were phenomenal. That place operates like a well oiled machine. The food was delicious, you practically had to roll me out of there. We had the duck, and a New York strip, table side salad, and shrimp cocktail. Everything was thought out, even to the cloth wrapped lemons to keep the seeds from getting in your food. Their drinks are perfect and the atmosphere is perfect for a date.",

Warm welcome with a rose for the ladies. Every table is s great spot. The menu is simple and not overwhelming with too many options. The seafood appetizer for amazing and could be a great main. Next course is the famous salad with 10 options for toppings and 3 dresses. Mini lemon sorbet cones to cleanse your pallet. I had the classic prime rib with asparagus. My date devoured his filet mignon. The included dessert tray of chocolate covered strawberries, dates and apricots. This is just a sampler but you have the option for an additional option of desserts. But I was too full. And in addition to the food the service was IMPECCABLE! We never went without anything, always had full drinks, and timing was perfect every step of the way. Save this for a special occasion or just a surprise night out for a classic Vegas experience. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place. From the first moment you walk in you feel as though you have been transported in time. It gives you that old school feel that so many of us look for when finding a new interesting restaurant. The host was super nice and welcoming and I was handed a rose before being escorted to my table, such a nice touch. Our server was nice enough not exactly super friendly but not rude either just kind of there. All of this would be fine except for the food.   Each entree comes with a salad, option for potatoes or rice, and chocolate covered fruits and the end. I was definitely a fan of the table side salad. Being somewhat particular I loved that you are able to pick exactly what you want included in your salad, such a great idea! I opted for the pepper ranch dressing and it was quite tasty. Once the entree came out was when the meal took a turn for the worst. My prime rib came out rare just like I ordered it which was a plus but it was quite bland and two bites in it got extremely cold. And I definitely didn't doddle eating it because I hadn't eaten all day! How did it turn so cold so quickly? I chose to get the side of red boiled potatoes and they gave me two cold potatoes with zero seasoning on them. And the side of veggies that they described so beautifully and that I was so excited for came out tasting like they had been cooked in a plastic bag, I could taste some sort of weird chemicals on them. In the end we also tried the tiramisu for dessert which was a big mistake because it came out  extremely dry and lacked flavor. One plus was that the chocolate covered desserts came out with a bowl of homemade whipped cream which is my favorite, soooo good.  But overall for the price, the food needs to be delicious and that just wasn't the case here. I would probably recommend visiting the bar for a drink so that you can experience the ambiance of the restaurant without having to ruin one of your meals in vegas.",

The vegetables though we're not   great, soggy and the mashed potatoes could really use some help. My husband and I like to go there so that we can just sit back and talk and relax but last night it seem like it was very loud and crazy.

    "text": "We ate here on Tuesday evening. My recommendation is don't bother. It was the worst meal I've had in a full year.  I love upscale steak houses like 3 Forks in Austin Tx. This isn't one. It was over priced and poorly executed. My 10oz fillet def wasn't 10oz, was crispy charred on the outside, medium Well instead of Medium and tough as shoe leather. Seriously. It came with a highly hyped tableside salad that was ridiculously heavy on red onion (requested a \"few\" got 3/4 cup vying in volume with the sad chopped romaine), a half dozen grape tomato halves and a tablespoon of hearts of palm. Blue cheese was offered along with anchovies and fresh mushrooms. No option for dressing on the side. This salad comes with the steak but is $21 on the menu as a stand alone item with no other salad options.  Also included were 2 sauces, that were lukewarm, for the steak, 5 small fingerling potatoes, and a melange of zucchini and onions. A tiny Lemon sorbet amuse the bouchee was also provided. A Chocolate covered strawberry was the dessert for $65 filet entree. No baked potato offering only mashed or fingerlings.  Fellow diners sampled the crab cakes declaring they were all filler with very little crab at 1/$21. The NY strip was also sub par, tough, indicating a lower quality grade of meat. Good steak doesn't rely on sauces or \"enhancements\". The Vegetarian options was also disappointing and extremely overpriced, considering you can get house made pasta at Eataly in the $20 range. The shells could have been frozen. Be aware there is a $26 charge for splitting any plate and a $25 per person charge for cancellations of reservations. I honestly don't understand the high ratings, obviously reviewers have ever had steak in Omaha or Austin where diners know great beef. Had the quality been there, these prices would be expected. The setting is a cellar and it's dark, but not excessively. White tablecloths imply upscale service that was sadly lacking. They didn't sweep crumbs between courses and no description of the items was provided. The server reached over plates and was unable to offer suggestions when asked. Each female was presented a promotional red rose, sweet, but frankly we were there on business and had no way of enjoying it beyond dinner. We left them. One of our party asked the kitchen be informed of a shellfish allergy and was informed \"you didn't order seafood\". Yes but even cooking items in a pan where shellfish was cooked can trigger a reaction.  My advice is ignore the yelp reviews and ask a local where to go for a great meal. We had high hopes that getting off the strip would improve our dining experience but Hugo's didn't deliver.",

    "text": "The excitement and high expectations of Hugo's Cellar was immediately crushed upon descending the stairs into the front lobby / Host Stand. Directly in front of us on our Anniversary as we were well dressed our eyes are fixated upon the grungy shorts and flip flop wearing trio descending the stairs as well. This is supposed to be Fine Dining.  The trio even stated to the host that they had a reservation. They must have known that this is upscale.  I guess upscale is just a notch above swimming trunks.  Anyway, while we walk to the host stand ourselves I feast my eyes upon the fake electric fireplace in the lobby.  Hmmm. Old School Vegas????   You got to be kidding me????  Our host greets us and wishes us a happy anniversary.  We get seated and are met immediately for a glass of water.  I'll get to the chase here.  We were seated in the very back.  Nothing romantic or inviting about this area.  The middle part of the restaurant was a bit more romantic with some nice lighting with string lights.   Our food?   I had the 16oz. Prime Rib.  My wife the Stuffed Shrimp.  The Prime Rib was good. The meat was Prime Quality but not much actual seasoning.  The aju sauce was flavorful as well as the creamy horseradish.  My wife's shrimp was slight over cooked as the meat would not separate from the shell when the tail was squeezed.  Plus the stuffing was a bit dry.  It needed some type of sauce or even a melted garlic butter.  We were treated with an anniversary dessert plate.  That touch was nice.  Our reservation was at 6:30.  We did not leave the restaurant until 8:25. Why so long?  Our actual table service was very slow.  My glass of tea was refilled once.  Im struggling on this one.  I want to give more stars. But honestly, service was literally no better than a mediocre steakhouse.  Clothing of clientele was as if we were at Chili's. Very disappointing.  We attend many fine dining restaurants.  This one I thought we were gonna be impressed.  Disappointment is what we got mostly out of this experience.",

Shortly after we were seated, one of the people in our party watched another patron having some sort of an emergency. The restaurant appeared to to have everything under control after about 30 minutes.   We ordered our food along with Shrimp Cocktail and a couple of other appetizers. The appetizers arrived and everyone sampled what was on the table, except me and one of my coworkers who split the Shrimp Cocktail. Dinner took a little over 3 hours and we left the restaurant around 10:00 pm. By the time I arrived back at the hotel (11:00), my stomach was queasy and by 11:30 I was sitting on the toilet.   When I arrived at our booth Friday morning, feeling like death warmed over, I learned that my coworker was ill also. I talked to all of the people in our party and learned that he and I were the only ones that ate the shrimp.   The last thing I expected out of a $94.00 meal was food poisoning.",

We did get a great private table that was really wonderful for our group, but things wnet downhill from the roses.  They give every lady a red rose when coming in, which may be a nice thing for some, but our friends who were getting married are men and they did not get a rose or any congratulations even though we alerted the host they were getting married. Then, the waiters served all the ladies first, again, slighting our special guests. I'm sure they just thought they were being polite with the \"ladies first\" thing, but it really didn't work here.  The waiter forgot to give us menus and asked what we wanted to order. We got menus and ordered and then came that ridiculous made to order salad that just doesn't work for a table for 12. Hearing the list of ingredients 12 times was super annoying and it was very time consuming. Then, the salad wasn't even good and the ranch dressing was near gross. The meal (Hugo's Chicken) was just OK, nothing special, but ok. The chocolate covered fruit at the end was the nicest part.   The cherry on top was having to walk up the stairs and onto the casino floor for the restroom, and going for the second time, having that inept host point it out and tell me it was good that it was far off because I'd need to work off my dessert.   Never again and I don't recommend this place to anyone.",

We looked at their menu's but could not find anything that we fell in love with.  We then decided to go to a restaurant that we have gone to many times in the past 25 years and never had a bad meal.  That restaurant is Hugo's Cellar at the Four Queens in downtown.  Not a downtown Las Vegas fan but the restaurant is so good we overlook were it is located.  Surprisingly nothing has changed since the first time we have been there.  We talked to the manager about this and he said the owner's philosophy is why change something if it is not broken.  The service was nothing less than outstanding and the food was delicious.  The price is very reasonable and includes a rolling salad cart to create your own salad, a small sorbet cone to cleanse your pallet, included starch, and lets not forget the chocolate covered strawberries and dried fruit.  We have to say that Hugo's is by far the best restaurant in Las Vegas.  We give Hugo's 5 stars.",

Every Lady that steps foot in here, receives a long stem red rose.. Brownie points already! We didn't have a reservation but we were given a table in literally a minute and the place was filled. The host was a jokester, had a great sense of humor that definitely set a positive vibe and loosened things up.  2 Servers(1 Server & 1 Assistant Server, Not Busser) immediately pulled out our chairs, and greeted us with much enthusiasm! Without wasting time, they poured their own in-house bottled water into our glasses. Within seconds, our bread basket (basic dinner rolls and  lavash) was dropped off with butter that had been intricately sculpted into a rose bud!   Menu offered a wide variety and every other entree I grazed at was so appealing. But I was sold on their 21 Day Dry Aged Top Shelf Rib Eye that is char-broiled and served with mushroom ragout and bordelaise sauce.  My girl orders Hugo's Chicken - breast of chicken stuffed with a sun dried tomato pesto and roasted garlic sauce. Both dishes included sides of veggies and mashed potatoes. Not only that, the order also came with their Custom Made Salad and Dessert!!!!!   Shortly after, a gentleman with this hunky salad cart rolled over and started to toss the  salad and asked what additions I cared for, about 15 different options! I added, creamy pepper dressing, onions, tomato, egg, artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, parmesan cheese and croutons (they had anchovies and nuts too..). The lettuce, onions, extremely juicy tomato was farm picked fresh, artichoke hearts and hearts of palms added that lucious subtle flavor, egg, parmesan cheese and croutons just complemented each other wonderfully!! This disappeared in minutes..   Then one of the servers handed us over a tiny ice cream cone with a scoop of raspberry sorbet! Nice!  About 10 minutes later, the servers came over with our piping hot plates of steak and chicken. The Steak was a chunky piece of meat that had Flawless grill marks checkered throughout. Fork tender and their mushroom/bordelaise aujus makes this Steak Unrivaled by Most Other Rib Eye's I've Ever Had!  The chicken had an aroma that filled the air with garlic and sundried tomatoes. As good as it smelled, it tasted even better! The stuffing/sauce flavors were expertly balanced with the chicken. Undeniably recommended!  The included sides were small but were a satisfying amount of vegetables, mash potato and pamesan crusted tomato that were all very good.  When we were done, the servers boxed our leftovers and bagged them for carry-out.  Next came the dessert tray, with an assortment of divine looking Treats.. We passed since we had our Chocoloate Covered/Dipped Strawberries, figs and apricot with their homemade whipped cream to come to the rescue! It came swiftly on this propped up cake stand, exactly what we needed to end the night right! Semi-sweet chocolate, flavorful fruits and fluffy whipped cream equals dessert Greatness!  What an Experience! This place has Romance written all over it! Candle-lit dim dining room, Accomodating A+ Service, and Most Importantly this place doesn't Break the Bank! Just be cautious not to crack open too many bottles of Wine!!",

    "text": "I lived in Las Vegas for 11 years and have been back twice a year since I moved away five years ago but I never made it to what is purported to be Las Vegas' 'Most Romantic Restaurant.'  It is a charming and cozy restaurant that offers all ladies a single red rose, romantic lighting, tuxedoed waiters and impeccable service.  Unfortunately for us, there were several families with small children dining at the same time and the shrieks and cries were distracting and obtrusive.  Despite this fact, we did our best to enjoy ourselves.    We both agreed that the table-side salad was one of the most delicious we'd ever had.  It's a weird thing to say about a salad but it's True!  After the salad we were offered a delightful sorbet on a tiny cone to cleanse the palate.  We both enjoyed a beef entree: for me the filet mignon wrapped in bacon and served over a lump crab cake and for him a huge slab of prime rib.    The prices are very reasonable considering that salad, entree, sides and a dessert tray are included.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and look forward to returning to Hugo's again during our next trip to Las Vegas!",

They were out of beef wellington, the item I MOST order and the rack of lamb, the item I was GOING to order in place of the Wellington.  The waiter (Eric) seemed embarrassed about the Wellington, and I would have appreciated if he had notified us of the outage upon our being seated, but what was most disconcerting was his lack of attention to us after our main dishes were served (I ordered the 10 oz. Filet, which was a bit on the rare side, but was corrected). After our dishes were served, the waiter seemed to 'disappear' and we were then attended to by the salad master, and the beverage support.  We will return, but will ask for an earlier seating...gotta have that Wellington !",

I'm only saying that because when i think about downtown i think about old town:  beat up and just worn down crappy area.  You'll have to walk through the casino and all, but once you hit those stairs that leads you downstairs it'll take you to a whole another level.  The ambiance is something else like you're part of the mob or crime family.  Got to love how this joint has so much character.  You get sooo much more than just the great food here.  Little things like a rose for each lady before seating, table side salad tossing, sorbet between course to cleanse the palate.  Defiantly one of the most memorable dining experience i ever partaken by far.  Wanted: A date, preferably a sugar mama.  Must have all original healthy teeth and no pointy elbows. *cha-ching!*",

IXNAY on the hearts of palm (it overpowers all the other flavors). keep it simple, less is more. LOVE the  baby shrimp on the salad - goes well with cream dressing, egg and bacon.",

I understand this is Vegas and whatever he assumed I can't blame him, however, he needs to set aside his opinions and lack of professionalism when on the job. I asked if they offered a side of sauteed spinach and he replied in a rude manner that they didn't. ..so I asked well what do you have? To which he said only a medley of veggies. I wanted to ask what they were and decided to just go with those. Aside from the terrible waiter who looked at me like I was an escort I love this place. Cozy old school, an underground hidden gem!

This was the first place that I brought him 14 years ago when he came to visit me in my hometown for Christmas break.  So, last night for our 12th wedding anniversary, we decided to take a walk down memory lane and kick Vegas old school.    First of all, the service is incredible.  You are consistently (in a good way) being checked on by the various servers.  You never have a moment of wanting.  The food was O M G!  We shared the lobster bisque.  I took the first bite, turned to husband, and said, \"THIS is what lobster bisque is supposed to taste like.\"  Great flavor and chunks of lobster.  The wine sommelier recommended a nice half bottle of pinot grigio for me to accompany my salmon.  I had it sauce nantua, which had a nice sauce with bay shrimp and crab meat.  I liked the accompanying veggies.  Husband had the Beef Wellington.  While we both enjoy our meals, husband does prefer his meat well, which is not possible with the Wellington.  Ended the beautiful meal with a house cappuccino.  ;-)   Complimentary salad is outstanding, as is the chocolate covered fruit.  This is a classy, old school Vegas place that is worth the trip to the Four Queens.  Husband's favorite part is that he does not leave hungry, unlike some of the other \"upscale\" places in town.",

    "text": "So when it comes to fancy dinners and fancy restaurants and all that jazz, I'm a newb.  I have very little experience eating at fancy steakhouses and fancy restaurants, though 2011 seems to be changing all of that.  Sometimes...perhaps in an optimistic perspective, change IS a good thing! =)    So when I went to Vegas to meet up with my bf and his family, along with the soon to be bride & groom, our celebration dinner was held here, an old school steak house located in downtown Las Vegas in the Four Queen's Hotel & Casino.  It's downstairs from the casino, and it's \"like\" you're in a cellar. Cool points, yes.  When you step inside you already feel the old school lady & gentlemen-like vibe.  The ladies are greeted by the hostess with red long stem roses, WOW!  Takin' it back to the old school when chivalry was common and ladies wore dresses everyday.  Very cool.    Our large party was comfortably seated in the back in a room with a large table, a bit secluded from the rest of the customers but not too much where we felt completely alone.  You can tell that this restaurant pays attention to all the little details.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0nWxGsPixYLsyi49gyxQ?select=gAM4ACYEhIx06gGnZ2dieg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0n...</a>  Gorgeous butter, looks like real roses.  I had to snap a picture before the guys dug into their bread and lavosh!  The menu here is pretty too, <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhugoscellar.com%2Ffiles%2Fmenu.pdf&s=fb0deb3d0d98447023ecb0bc4037bda136d8e15735c04cda9713c78f2fa94acc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hugoscellar.com/files/me...</a> , what I liked about this steakhouse was that they included the prices for each meal.  AND, if you read carefully, the meals COME with sides.  Unlike other fancy restaurants where you have to order your starch and your veggies, it's all included on your plate and in the price.  Even the side table service salad, which was incredibly delicious, is included.  My boyfriend and I tried the orange walnut dressing, which is more of a vinaigrette, and it was AMAZING! Toppings were extensive to, he goes around asking what you want.   And I give props to him, there were 13 of us I think!!  Our servers were great, consistent in their service, and were patient while they took our orders.  We munched on the bread & lavosh and a bunch of us shared this lovely appetizer :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0nWxGsPixYLsyi49gyxQ?select=2tIJIqMtkeY_nKVA-CQbSw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0n...</a> I've never had it baked or made like this, and I enjoyed it very much.  Now this is when I got confused---  my lack of experience in fancy restaurants will do this to me --- they brought out these: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0nWxGsPixYLsyi49gyxQ?select=uw_zJGr1XcaAgm0PinftyA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0n...</a>  \"Why are they giving  us dessert before our meal? \" Confused look but hey that looks yummy...  Come to find out, they're palette cleansers--- Wow spiffy!  It tasted like raspberry sherbert and it did its job pleasantly.  Cuz my main meal was scrumptious.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0nWxGsPixYLsyi49gyxQ?select=6GeGY9m4Z4N4Idq5KqtREQ  most of the guys ordered prime ribs:  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0nWxGsPixYLsyi49gyxQ?select=w5lMYhy-RCtaiwM0dSVLCg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0n...</a> all around the table everyone enjoyed their meals.  The meat was good and the sides were just enough to complement the hunk of meat we all had.   Now, there are choices of great desserts here, they're even on a cart for every one to see when you walk in.  But, the meal also comes with this:  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0nWxGsPixYLsyi49gyxQ?select=0nuarmXcKjJsZOBQNx-FlQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0n...</a>  which to me, was just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth that starts aching for some form of dessert after a good meal.  I absolutely loved this steakhouse and I'm glad the whole fam was able to celebrate the soon to be bride & groom here.  Great atmosphere, attentive staff, quality food, and attention to detail.  5 stars in my book!! Now all of you, go try it when you're in downtown vegas!  Yelp 365 challenge:  59/ 365",

I ordered a Negroni which was the best value In Vegas.  (Basically two large cocktails).   The shrimp scampi appetizer was cooked to perfection.     Each entree is served with a salad that is made table side.  There were 7 folks at our table and we all loved the salads.   The restaurant lived up to all the hype and we all will be returning on our next visit to Vegas.  Bananas  Foster was made at the table and the Kona coffee brewed in front of you topped off the experience.",

Needless to say, management should have moved the complaining party, as we were at our booth first, expecting to have an adult evening. We paid our bill and left.

We made our selections and when the entrees came out we noticed both my filet and her lamb chop were under cooked. I could deal with my filet but her lamb was still blue. I notified one of our waiters and our main server came over and took part of the lamb back for further cooking. It came out a few minutes later burnt on the outside and still extremely rare on the inside. She couldn't even eat any of her $60 lamb chop. The server never once came back to check on her, no one addressed our obvious discomfort and then we just got presented with the bill.  For what \"was\" my favorite romantic restaurant to take my lady I was extremely disappointed.  I don't see myself returning.",

Every lady gets a rose when you come in which is a nice touch. Never had to ask for a thing as our server was constantly filling our glasses and asking if we needed anything. Sorbet was given to cleanse the palette which again was kind of cool.  We ordered the filet/shrimp combo & a chicken dish (can't remember the name). Night ended with our Server comping us a free dessert and wrapping our rose to go. Has an old school Vegas vibe to it which was unique but definitely worked.",

We went for our wedding anniversary and order the crab cakes for our appetizer. I don't care for crab cake but it was delicious. Table side salad, I had the orange vinaigrette... yum!!! My filet mignon was cooked the way I asked. The lobster tail was thick and juicy. They give you sorbet between salad and dinner to clear your palette. Then at the end, you get 2 chocolate dipped strawberries, figs and apricot. I only ate the strawberries. The room was dimmed and had a great atmosphere. But our waiter, Marco was amazing!!! He was very nice, great personality and te tentative. Highly recommended!",

The prices for each dish include everything which is bottled water, a full size salad complete with shrimp, eggs, and nearly anything else you can think of, sorbet for palette cleanser, entree with vegetable and potatoes or rice, and fruit dipped in different chocolates. We also ordered escargot, a bottle of wine, and pecan cheesecake. Left completely stuffed and thinking every penny we spent was well worth it.

    "text": "HUGO'S WILL SPOIL YOU.  Nice reception. The hostess was very kind.  The waiter was quick to my table, friendly and explained the menu very well.  How about some whipped butter with an assortment of fresh bread? YUP.  For those who enjoy wine, Hugo's has a sommelier...wine stewart. If wine knowledge isn't your thing, it's ok...there won't be a quiz.  Sommeliers won't make you feel stupid. They're available to help with pairings and a deeper understanding of wine IF you want.  Who doesn't love a table-side salad cart? Many fresh and chilled salad fixin's to choose from.  You may be surprised with the raspberry sorbet pallet cleanser. This is not common.  You might think...WHAT, dessert comes first? No, this is how rich people eat.  LOL.  Let me circle back to the waiter and service. I like a waiter who will not only make suggestions, but damn near insist you eat a particular menu item.  Of course, we the customer have final say, but it shows the waiter will go beyond normal service.  You can order sides, but Hugo's isn't cheap.  They will provide veggies and starch with your main course. Also, they have sauce options for meat items.  The dinner concluded with an assortment of complimentary goodies, including chocolate covered strawberries and FRESH whipped cream. I was caught off guard. I thought I was suppose to choose one of many treats on the dessert tray. Nope, they were all for me! I understand Hugo's offers a pretty amazing Banana's Foster table side show.  I don't how people do it. The other courses are not small.  Following dinner, both the waiter and hostess insist I come back...as if I was a celebrity or high roller. I was given a business card with the hostess' name and phone number...the restaurant phone number.  I will DEFINITELY give them a call.  NOW, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND LOOK THROUGH ALL THE PHOTO'S.",

We would come here every trip but we love to only reserve it for our yearly anniversaries, it is that special! I would really refrain from ordering an appetizer because unless you are ready to eat an insane amount you will be full by the time your main course comes. The price is great because you get a huge salad, sorbet, entree, and dessert all included (hence don't order and appetizer). If you are super hungry though the lobster bisque appetizer is amazing. For dessert I highly recommend the bananas foster which is flambeed in front of you. The Sommelier is also the best around, he is so nice and knowledgeable.",

    "text": "Last night was my first trip to Hugo's Cellar in probably 10 years or so. I have been telling my wife about it since before we were married and we are coming up on 7 years.   Hugo's is what old Vegas used to be. Fine dining with personalized service. Something you don't get too much of these days. Our reservation was at 8:30, but we showed up early to have a drink. The bar area at Hugo's is VERY SMALL. The bar has 5 seats and there are 3 tables available. There is no table service in the bar so you have to order yourself. The drinks are a good value. You are handed your glass and then a carafe in an ice bucket. You get 3 drinks out of it. Not kidding. Of course, I am only speaks mg for those if us who drink martinis or Manhattans.   Them menu is very old school. It has things like Beef Wellington, escargot en crut, and Chateubreaun. I ordered the escargot, of course, and it is probably the best I have had. My wife said it was the best she has had. My wife and I both had the Beef Wellington. I had never had it before and I wanted to see what Gordon Ramsey is always yelling about on Hell's Kitchen. Lol It was served with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. For my first Wellington, it was incredible. So tender.   The funniest part of the Hugo's experience is the salad cart. Your waiter will wheel this cart over with all kinds of things. He will then read off a list of things and all you say is yes or no. I suggest being last so you don't hold up the train and if you don't have the ingredients memorized after the 9 people that ordered salad before you, then I don't know what to tell you. Lol  Hugo's decor hasn't changed at all from what I can tell. I am sure the booths have been redone at some point. The clientele is a good mix of young and old. I think there were a few working girls in the room also. Lol  So if you want that old school Vegas experience, go to Hugo's and ask for Sinatra's booth.   There is valet parking available at the Four Queens and there is self parking as well. However, if you are coming from elsewhere, I recommend taking Uber or Lyft.",

Didn't necessarily want something romantic but, I did want something different and super old school. And after recommendations from my boss, this sounds like it could be as Super OG as can be!  And after looking at other restos I wanted to try, I think this place had the most bang for the buck AND THEY HAVE RACK OF LAMB (my fave!)   Right in the cellar of Four Queens, lies this little gem of a restaurant!   After getting our romantic drink of Hennessy on the rocks, we ordered the shrimp scampi, lamb, and rib eye. Initially, we wanted to order the appetizer of hot rock but, our waiter (Glenn) said he didn't recommend it as it was a lot of food that we were ordering already -- hence the shrimp scampi switch up!  And our waiter was on the dot about that.   The table side salad that came with our meal was delicious. I love salad so I could've had him come around once more :)   My lamb was fantastic. Not too many places have lamb so this was exciting to me. Other steak houses make their lamb toooo salty for me so, this was perfect. Not salty at all and was amazing with the tasty mash potatoes and veggies.  The Indonesian sauce it came with was tasty, but I liked my lamb just the way it was.  The BF, actually, took my sauce for his rib eye which he found delish!   After entrees, we got a complimentary cake and ice cream and their standard fruits dipped in chocolate. It was very nice!   Ended the night with their Kona coffee brewed tableside. That was definitely the high light for the BF as he's a HUGE coffee drinker.  The more it boiled and brewed the more amazing our area smelled. Coffee accouterments of cinnamon sticks and mint chocolate was unexpected and yummy!   Service was awesome! Ambiance was vintage and really OG. Like this is where Frank Sinatra used to go. That's craaaazzzyyyyyy!   I'd love to come back with a bigger party so, I can enjoy this place again :) Downtown Favorite for sure!",

We specifically left the strip to head over to the crazy nakedness of Fremont Street to have the always excellent service and food at Hugo's Cellar.   it's such a random little spot at the Four Queens and easily missed if you're not looking. I lov that all us ladies get treated with a rose. Each of the steak entrees come with the tableside salad where they make to order a large salad with as many or as little of the fixins as you want.   I love the little touches of lemon sorbet to clean the palate between salad and meal as well as the chocolate dipped fruit at the end.   I have had the beef wellington many times and am amazed that every time they are able to bake this nice fluffy puff pastry with a perfectly made medium cooked filet inside.  The potatoes are garlicky and smooth and a wonderful side to the steak.   The tableside desserts of bananas foster is always a \"treat\" to watch as well as eat!",

It's an old school restaurant that's been around for a long time. The decor is old but food is great!  Such a nice touch, that all ladies receive a long stem rose when being seated. We started with martinis and they were awesome!  All meals include a house salad made at the table side.   Highly recommend the Hugo Scampi. Delicious large shrimp in a excellent sauce.  We enjoyed the fruit sorbet that cleansed our palate!  I had the 10 ounce  filet and it was served with bearnaise sauce, mashed potatoes and veggies.  IT WAS GREAT!! My husband had the rib eyed and loved it.  They even include chocolate covered fruit for light dessert.  Overall, it's not some fancy Strip restaurant but I highly recommend visiting this classes old joint. We had a lovey experience.  All the servers are dressed so classy! Wine menu/selection was great.  Worth a visit even just for drinks and apps.",

Service was extremely horrible! They never came to check on us. My husband waited for a drink refill forever. I actually had to find our server and ask if we could get another drink.  Food was definitely not worth the money at all! It was like eating a steak from a buffet. If it wasn't for the little extras that they do, the rose, the raspberry sorbet ice cream mini cone that they bring out before your meal to cleanse your palette, the chocolate covered strawberry after your meal...actually no not even the extras made it worth it! I was upset at how pricey it was for how horrible the place is. Mind you it's inside the Four Queens downtown so not in a nice hotel, it's in a dark restaurant which makes sense to go with their theme but for the price, service and food, it was horrible! I definitely would not recommend it.   Oh also just one last thing, when one table ordered some table side app they cooked it and smoke was everywhere...no ventilation for that type of cooking.",

We watched everyone get served around us, when our waiter finally did come he was blah at best. It took 45mins just to get our food. 25 mins before we even got approached for a drink order. They weren't exceptionally busy because we only waited 10mins for a table (even Denny's can do better) I mean when your paying $50 minimum for an entree you can AT LEAST get decent service. The food was boring and tasted pretty bland, we left most of it and just ran out because we were so uncomfortable. Spend your money somewhere else!",

Against the back wall, where we could sit side by side and hold hands. After 46 years of marriage, that is pretty cool.   Cocktails:  Grey Goose martinis served up wit a twist. Great drink but the presentation is incredible. Served with a martini glass chilled with ice around the edges, each martini was in a carafe which was inside a crystal ice bucket.  What a cool presentation.  Salad: simply incredible. Made table side, with what you want.   Entree:  steak-perfect,  couldn't be better. Scallops-incredible. Wine: perfectly delivered after fun discussion with John. Desert: wonderful.  Special birthday desert:  unexpected and out of this world!

That was....This past Monday May 28 my wife and I and a a couple of friends went for my wife's Special Birthday Dinner. From the getgo it wasn't THE Hugo's we know.We were greeted by this indifferent old blonde who claimed she was a manager and ushered to a table as you enter the room despite having made a reservation a week earlier! Then we sat for 15 minutes for water and waiter to appear. The manageress remained indifferent to it all.But the worst was the food. Gone was the panache that came with the rolling salad Barn Now is that a crappy mini cart. The veal chop, our fave was no longer on the menu due to problems with the purveyor we were told. (Gimme a break). The salad presentation was mediocre. And then the entrees, all 4 arrived and looked like places that I would not dine at. My rack of lamb we no longer a rack, but double chops laying on a plate, My wife's veal scalloping arrived in a tepid state as were the mashed potatoes, and sent back to be nuked no doubt. There are no vegetable choices here for this 64.00 plate. here. Our friends were equally underwhelmed by their food, the presentation and the attitude of this manager. Never again will I descend into what has truly become a cellar in it's most negative way. Folks, if you want to blow almost 400 dollars on dinner, you can sure do better in This town.",

I was essentially ignored by the waiter that took my order, and was checked on more by the water server and the person that prepared my salad. The salad options were great and the bread was good.  Nice atmosphere. If you've got loads of time or are in a big party, you'll probably have a better time. Dress is business casual but I went in with a t shirt and hoodie, and saw retirees in Hawaiian shirts and some sports jerseys.  For a $52 steak, I expected better service. It came with mashed potatoes and veggies, and a strawberry desert. Still cheaper than Gordon Ramsey's steakhouse.",

Our birthday girl was not offered a dessert though we saw several others coming out with candles...for that matter, none of us was offered dessert.  Our server's assistant came with the bill. We asked if the 20% had been deducted for our players' club cards and he assured it had. On review, it hadn't.  He was a big aggravated to have to take it to be redone.

We got there 30 minutes early to have a glass of wine (the house wine is Franciscan) and enjoy the complimentary pate and nuts at the bar.  The table-side salad is the best - I'm probably the only girl on earth who loves anchovies - and they have toppings like bay shrimp, blue cheese crumbles, and hearts of palm.  The honey walnut dressing complements the salad.  My hubby and I split one of the chicken dishes, wasn't in the mood for steak, and were pretty full so we took the rest to go.    The best part of the dinner are the complimentary chocolate covered strawberries and dried fruit they give you - the staff was kind enough to make it to go for us.

Let me first say I was very surprised to find a romantic and quiet restaurant just below the casino floor of the 4 Queens. There is a stairway down right next to the buffet, so I was a little nervous going in.  We had a party of six all dressed downtown casual, but they did not bat an eyelash and were able to seat us immediately. They even handed each of the ladies a long-stemmed red rose.   The food was great. Especially the table-side salad. (One of the best restaurant salads I've had.) The service was even better. Despite our casual attire, we were treated very well and had excellent service by our server and enjoyed a great conversation with an outstanding sommelier.   Thank you Hugo's for delivering an outstanding meal without the usual snobbery of this type of high class establishment.",

Yes, you are looking to spend $40-50 per person, but unlike most fine steakhouses that are ala carte, this price includes bread, salad, and chocolate dipped fruit dessert. I definitely did not expect to find such fine dining in a casino in downtown Las Vegas.",

I asked the locals where do they go to have fun and almost everyone responded \"Freemont St\". It definately lived up to the hype in the fact that it was just a huge block party style atmosphere, but what took the cake was Hugo's Cellar. This restaurant has a very balanced menu from the soup to nuts. The build your own salad to the braised lamb had me in heaven with every bite. The expertise of the sommelier was very helpful in proper wine selection. The ambiance is very intimate and perfect for a date night. Be prepared to drop a few dollars but it is a nice alternative to the hustle and bustle of the strip. I definitely will go back.",

The extra touches (each woman who comes in gets a rose, salad customized and made at your table, complimentary chocolate dipped strawberries, figs, and apricots) all really made the dining experience superb.  I finished with a brandy cappuccino, another slam dunk.  We didn't have reservations, but someone else didn't show up so they took us no problem.  Fantastic place!",

    "text": "The girlfriend and I were checking out Fremont Street on a Wednesday evening.  It was dinnertime and we were hungry.  After some cursory research, we decided to give Hugo's Cellar a try.  Tucked away downstairs off of the casino floor at Four Queens, Hugo's Cellar is an unassuming looking place, which, from its decor, looks like time stood still stopping somewhere in the late-60s/early-70s.  That said, this only adds to the dining experience as Hugo's Cellar exudes old school charm and harkens back to the day when going out to dinner at a nice restaurant was truly considered a special occasion.  We didn't have reservations, not that we probably needed them on this particular mid-week evening.  Upon stepping up to the host stand, the maitre-d handed a red rose to my girlfriend (and all women who dine at the restaurant) before leading us to our table.  At its heart, HC is a steak place, but the menu has a good selection of seafood choices as well as lamb, veal, chicken, and duck.  We opted for the Chateaubriand and Lobster for Two which consisted of a roasted center-cut tenderloin filet and broiled lobster tails with a side of green and white asparagus.  Soon after our order was placed, a cart wheeled up to prepare custom, made to order salads at our tableside.  The salad was made with fresh romaine lettuce and topped with pretty much anything you could think to throw on a salad.  Think salad bar at Fogo de Chao, not Ponderosa.  After our salads were cleared away, David our lead server delivered two small cones of raspberry sorbet to cleanse our palate.  Next, our main course was served up.  The chateaubriand was cooked to a perfect medium rare doneness, as requested, and the good-sized lobster tails were also flawlessly prepared, moist, tender and flavorful.  The GF remarked it was the best lobster tail she'd ever had.  A meal like this required a good, hearty red wine.  HC has an extensive and surprisingly affordable wine list.  Vince, the extremely knowledgeable and personable sommelier, guided us through the list, but we knew exactly what we wanted when we spied a bottle of the 2008 Frank Family Cabernet Sauvignon ($68).  Frankly (no pun intended), this wine at the price was a steal especially given the fact that a bottle retails in the $40-50 range online!  The 2007 Frank Family Cab was the best wine I had the pleasure of tasting this year and the 2008 shared virtually all of the same, pleasurable characteristics of the 2007.  At this point, I didn't need anything else to eat.  Yet, a plate of chocolate-dipped strawberries, dried apricots, and figs showed up at the table to close out our thoroughly enjoyable meal.        Compared to the Strip, Downtown Vegas and Fremont Street lacks the wide array of fine dining choices.  However, Hugo's Cellar easily dispels the notion that there isn't any fine dining to be found and that you need the culinary draw of a big name, celeb-chef to be successful.  Hugo's Cellar isn't a cheap night out, but it delivers quality, quantity, and among the highest levels of service I've ever experienced at a restaurant.  Old school, indeed!",

Even though the service and atmosphere were great, the food was so disappointing, especially at about 50 bucks each for the main entree.  The rack of lamb was under seared, under cooked, and under seasoned. The result was a very gaming smell dish which I couldn't even finish. Well, the upside was the mash potato that came with the lamb was good ... LOL  My friend's fish entree was average and nothing special, which I wouldn't have b***** about it if it didn't cost 49 bucks for it.  Maybe it was a bad night for them, but these kinda of food quality probably won't get my second visit.",

When you see the price of an entree it appears to be costly, then you find out that you get a huge salad made at your table, a little sherbet served between the salad and main course, then to top everything off chocolate dipped strawberries, dried figs and apricots. The waiters keep your water glass filled and anything else you need.  The long stem rose for the ladies is a nice touch. I had the prime rib served just as ordered and my wife the filet mignon which was perfect. This restaurant gives you both good food and tastefully extras.",

We didnt know it at the time, but Hugo's Cellar turned out to be the best dinner we had on our trip. The ambiance was incredible, the service was wonderful, and the food was amazing. It has a special \"old world\" charm to it and, in my opinion, is a must visit for any foodie traveling to Las Vegas.  Just a note: dont let the casino (Four Queens) or the downtown area in general deter you from dining at Hugo's Cellar. Its a quiet, charming, and classy restaurant in the midst of a less-than classy area.   Food musts: the escargot & the table-side salad.  Never in my life did I think I would rave about a salad like I have about the one at Hugo's Cellar. Its what all salads should strive to be like.",

Great ambiance, ladies greeted with roses, attentive service, table side salad custom built, sorbet before main course and delicious chocolate covered fruits at the end.  All martinis and wine and cocktails were spot on delicious  What was very nice was that it was all salad and sides were included with your dinner, no ala cart which is hard to find anymore.  Most everyone had steak and enjoyed them.  I however I went with scallops and they were not great.  Overcooked with a sauce that overpowered everything on the plate.  Now to be fair, we were all pretty happy with everything but the reason for the 3 stars was a meltdown at the end when the bill was paid.  Cards were ran and we were all getting up to leave fat and happy when are waiter came sprinting out telling us the bill was processed wrong, mind you it was correct and all of our charges were correctly ran, over $800 worth. This turned into a fiasco that never should have been noticed by us, it was a POS issue with their system (wrong table number on the bill ) and our experience should never had been bothered by this.  Bottom line, I still have 2 large transactions on my card and have to dispute one with the bank now 3 days later.  Hate to bog down a review with something like this but that's not how you manage a fine dining establishment.",

With reservations secured we are seated in a private room in the back called the party room. Actually very nice 10 Top in secluded gated off area.  Waiters are on us along with John the long time sommellier.  Reconmending a very nice Cabernet we are on to the main event. All entrees come with the Table side Salad made to order with your options of at least 8-10 accutrements. Salad for each of us was cold, fresh,  and dressings and overall presentation and taste was top notch. Delicious.   Entrees go for the beef folks and if you do go for the beef go for the PRIME RIB!...  Couple of NY Strips were on a scale of 1-10 about a 7... Good top shelf quality but not the blow me away one.  A bone in Filet was also 7 out of 10 as was the rib eye.  The balance of the group ordered the Giant Cut of prime rib and folks this sucker could tip over Fred Flintstone's car.   Big rich in color, flavor & Texture and served with  Nice Auju.  All entrees also included choice of potatoe and grilled vegetables.  Too much food for one man to finish.  Some after dinner drinks, and coffees were enjoyed without desert.   Service and atmosphere in downtown vegas was fantastic and it was truly and enjoyable experience across the board.  1 star off as Steaks were just miss on greatness but price points exceptional, wine list reasonable and prime rib KILLER.",

    "text": "Service at Hugo's is EXCELLENT...from the friendly Host who greets you and gives red roses to the ladies, to the server, assistant server, and bus boy they are all very pleasant and very attentive. This place is a must visit when in Las Vegas...it's not advertised but is very busy due to word of mouth. You can tell you are in a five star restaurant with the amount of care you are given here.  The food here is first-rate. Each entree comes with assorted warm breads and special cheese-toasted lavosh, bottled water, and Intermezzo-Fruit sorbet. It also includes their table-side salad, from which you can choose crisp romaine lettuce, peeled tomato wedges, marinated artichokes and hearts of palm, sliced mushrooms, blue cheese crumbles, toasted croutons, roasted pine nuts, chopped eggs, red onions and bay shrimp and a selection of dressings: Caesar, creamy pepper or honey-orange-walnut vinaigrette. The entree also comes with fresh vegetable du jour and choice of roasted garlic whipped potatoes, red potatoes with parsley or wild rice. They also serve white and dark chocolate dipped strawberries, apricots and baby figs after the meal. With all the accompaniments we did not bother with ordering appetizers.   The table-side salad was delish! Love that everything is made to order thus making the experience more special. The cheese toasted lavosh bread is so yummy I ate way too much of it.  I loved the rose butter it was such a lovely touch. The sorbet was a great touch specially if you had anchovies on your salad. My dad and I both ordered the Filet and Shrimp Aux Poivre (5 oz filet and about 6 pcs of shrimps), my mom got the rib eye and my husband the 10 oz filet. My meal was superb...the filet was a perfect medium and the shrimp was not chewy or rubbery. The peppercorn sauce an awesome flavor to the shrimp. The garlic mash potato was delicious...you can taste the garlic flavor but it was not over-powering. The fresh vegetable was cooked to perfection. The chocolate dipped fruits were also delightful. You can tell that they use high quality chocolate. I ordered creme brulee for dessert...that too was lovely but not as great as everything else.  I love the ambiance at Hugo's...it's cozy and relaxing even though it is somewhat formal. The price for the food is somewhat high but is well worth for the quality of food and service that you get.",

Unfortunately the food wasn't, I did like the table side salads, it was a pleasant surprise as well as the complimentary sorbet and strawberries and dried fruit. I order the beef Wellington, the best meal I have had in vegas was at Gordon Ramsey's steak. Hugo's did not even come close to the Wellington I had at Steak. The meat was completely rare and the pastry was still gooey and undercooked. The garlic mash was good but the veg had no seasoning. I expected something a lot better considering the price and reviews. Maybe the chef just had an off night, but it was not worth the money.",

    "text": "Party of 5 at 6PM on a Monday; it was good for old school steak on Fremont. The lobster bisque gets high points for being served hot. It was delicious and its a very generous serving. Salad is cold and large, but overly dressed and the choices of dressings are too limited (with the cesear not really an option for most people since it reeks of anchovies). Don't spend your money on the king crab legs - unimpressive and not worth it. Stick to the steak; filet is excellent as was the beef wellington. Solid player in a classic Fremont casino. Its nice that it is still around and its charm hasn't faded too much. Whether they can stand up to a Ruth's Chris or modern steakhouse.. no. But its all about the tradition here. Service was good - although a bit distracted for being so early in the evening.",

    "text": "Hugo's = Vegas Legend? Yes!  Hugo's = The REAL old school Vegas Experience? Yes!   Hugo's cellar is definitely one of the best restaurants I have EVER eaten in Las Vegas. We journey to Vegas multiple times a year and have tried many of the so called \"best\" in vegas spots via YELP/Tripadvisor.    Honestly, They dont compare to Hugos in price, service, ambiance, and quality of dishes. Hugos is a classic and I hope never changes. What folks need to realize, is that places like Hugos dont hardly exist anymore. So you better help keep these places alive.  A classic top notch service gourmet room in 2013? Nearly impossible to find. Hugos is one of the best in Vegas for their traditional menu (Old School but in a good way) offering Steak, Seafood,Prime Ribs, Beef Wellington, Chateaubriand and they succeed flawlessly in delivering excellent food and and service. Hugos You found customers for life.  Service: We were greeted in a warm and friendly manner. The waiters were professional and top notch.  Food was spaced and paced adequately and they had the mandatory 3 person wait staff present for all tables. They also prepared custom table-side salad for ALL orders. Do I want shrimp in that salad? Heck yes. Fresh cracked pepper? A must! I get to choose my toppings? My my my.   Food: Wife and I had the Prime Rib, which were excellent in terms of quality and price. The Prime Rib was cooked well and came with all the accoutrements. Solid piece not to mention the custom salad cart.   Bread: Warm and soft. They had really yummy bread. Probably shouldn't have filled up on it.   Atmosphere: Nothing fancy, but clean and orderly. It was probably the nicest spot in the 4 Queens Casino. Its downstairs by the poker tables if your lost.",

    "text": "Need to find a place in downtown that is romantic? Then you have found the right place.  Located in The Four Queens on Fremont St, you walk down some stairs and walk into a lobby with a few tables and a fireplace with a fire going. Everything is dim and all by candlelight which I love immediately. I came here with a party of 6 for my Birthday dinner and there were 3 ladies (including me) in our group and we each got a rose! How sweet. We had a reservation for 630pm and we were promptly seated.  Our server was great and walking into this restaurant, you definitely get that old school vibe like how it was back in the 50's or 60's and that's how the server's were too. They wore tuxes and they were just a notch above. I ordered the Filet Mignon and it was cooked perfectly with a great juicy flavor. Oh yeah, and it was huge so definitely didn't finish it. LOL. When you order an entree, you get the pleasure of having a salad made at your table. It was a different guy that does this and he was hilarious! The salad was made just to how I like and it was great. After we were done with the salad, we were served sorbet to \"cleanse our palates\" and that was super tasty too! After our entree, we were served a selection of dessert items (chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots). And since it was my birthday, I got a slice of pecan cheesecake which was ridiculous! And I got sung too which made it even better!! Oh yeah and no cell service down here since it's in the \"cellar\". Kind of nice!  This restaurant is the epitome of old school Vegas style and the romantic feel of it is top notch. The food fits right in and the service was impeccable. I can not wait to come back with just the Hubs for a romantic date night!",

Reviews for Hugo's cellar were really good and the Chateaubriand and lobster for two sounded like just the ticket for our celebration. The setting is lovely, dark and romantic. The meal started off nicely with a wonderful salad served table side but unfortunately the experience went down from there.  We were quite excited when we saw the nice sized lobster tail and were fully ready to enjoy.  The steak was ordered mid rare and served medium and the poor shellfish was overcooked to the point that no amount of butter to dip it in was going to help.  The staff was semi solicitous and asked if we wanted replacements but we opted to just take our desert to go and make an end to the disappointing meal.",

Everyone at my table enjoyed their meal. I had the fish of the day, which was done perfectly, but can't comment too much on everyone elses.  The others in my parties got a Ribeye and some other cut of steak and both gave two monster thumbs up. The sides were perhaps a bit too rich, but nothing to really cause a downgrade.  Service: Service stuck out the most to me and really is what earned this the five star.  From the beginning they are extremely attentive.  The rose for the ladies was welcomed by all.  Additionally, we had a classically trained sommelier who was excellent and chose a wine that really actually complemented the meal, that was not even close to the most expensive on the menu.     Ambience: Classy place, dark (not too dark) and romantic.  I thought it had excellent acousitcs insofar as you knew others were in the restaurant but you could still talk at a nice level.    Price: $300 for four of us with a good amount of wine seemed extremely fair for the enjoyment we got from the night.  So it is pricey, but less so than most of the fancier steakhouses in town.  I definitely recommend for a special night out.",

    "text": "We returned to Hugo's Cellar for my boyfriend's daughter's birthday and were VERY disappointed in their service!  This is the first time I have ever had bad service.  We sat for almost 25 minutes before we got offered anything to drink and then we had to flag down Greg, the gentleman who serves the salad, and ask him where our waiter was and if he could just take our order.    Our waiter did not even bother to stop by until our food was brought out and even then he did not apologize about not helping us and just tried to drop the food off and run away.  Two of the steaks were cooked wrong, and of course one was the birthday girl's!  This is one of the only steakhouses in town that cooks steak the way my boyfriend and his daughter like it and she had never been to a nice steakhouse before and we really wanted her to experience what Hugo's usually offers.  They did offer to have the steaks fixed, but at this point we were all starving and wanted to eat together so they just kept them as they were.    Then all the waiters sang happy birthday to a big group at the front.  Mind you, when I made the reservation I told the hostess that we were coming to celebrate a young girl's birthday and asked if there was anything they could do and I was told she would get dessert.  Her birthday was not even acknowledged at all through out the whole dinner, not even when we were offered dessert!  When this happened after we had watched another table get the full birthday treatment and his daughter felt kind of left out or not very special he got up and walked away from the table to so he did not get upset with the waiter.  When the waiter asked if there was a problem I told him we are here for her birthday and wanted her to experience what we usually experience when we dine here and it has been anything but pleasant.  He didn't even say sorry and just walked away!!!    In the meantime, three other tables that were in our waiter's area were being totally ignored and one of them had been seated before us and got their food long after us.  I don't know if this waiter was new or what his deal was.  But his rude manners and lack of concern for his customers has made my boyfriend not ever want to return again, which makes me very sad as this is my favorite steakhouse!  I'm very disappointed in the service and how we were treated.  The food is still wonderful as ever, but for the price I can go anywhere else in town, even Olive Garden, and get better service than we got.",

I am not a huge meat lover and I had a chicken dish that was surprisingly delicious. After dinner, we walked out of the casino and walked Fremont street.

We did not have reservation, so we went to see if they had any open tables. We got there at 6:30pm and the host said he needed to wait until 6:45 to see if any reservations did not show up. So we decided to wait. At 6:40 the host said he had a cancel.   I like to rate my food items on a 5 star scale. The number of * is my ratings  What we ordered/items came with entrees: Caesar salad*, NY Sirloin*, Tomato/ pesto stuffed chicken*, dessert plate (we did not eat any of it)  Positives: Lemon sorbet that is served between the salads and entrees. No ordering of sides separately (also listed on negatives). Build your own salad tableside. Service for bread and water  Negatives: Atmosphere: Very dark, old feeling, and very small place. They have too many tables for the table side service for the salads and desserts. We sat at a table and when the gentleman was preparing the salads for the booths behind us he kept bumping into us.  Service: The waiter had broken English so it was hard to understand him. He did not make any recommendations. Right after we ordered the guy came to make our salads. The gentleman did not recommend any salad or describe any of the dressings. We heard him describing everything to the tables behind us after we ordered.   Food:  Salads- Terrible dressing was very very fishy (anchovies). Entrees- First, my steak. The steak seemed like it was from a cafe that serves the $1.99 steak and eggs. This was not a steak from an expensive steakhouse. My wife's chicken was something that you could also get at a cheap cafe.  Sides- This was very disappointing that the sides came with the entree instead of us being able to order what we want. The entree sides were a stuff tomato, veggies, and mashed potatoes.  This was the most disappointing places we have EVER been to. We have been to many expensive steakhouses and this by far is the WORST. We are locals there are many other great places to eat.",

    "text": "After looking for the \"most romantic restaurant in Vegas\" I came across a few on the strip, and then I saw Hugo's Cellar.  I was intrigued by the old-school charm it seemed to have, and the yelp and travel advisor reviews were all positive so I thought I'd give it a try.  The best part about this place is the location, the ambiance and the wait staff.  We were greeted sincerely, my wife was given a rose as we were seated.  The staff are all knowledgeable adults, not college kids looking to make a buck and move on.  My wife loved the dark, cellar like decor, and it was a great quiet place for a romantic dinner.  The food was really good, although I've had a better filet elsewhere, it was still delicious, and the portions were healthy.  After the bread, table side salad and sorbet palate cleanser, we were almost too full to even eat our entrees. But we managed.  Overall, I will definitely recommend this place, and probably be back for another special night out with my lady.",

It was what we expected from a place that is often described as \"old Vegas.\"  We got the crab cakes and lobster bisque to start.  Loved the cakes, the bisque was not as big of a hit.  The famous salad cart came next.  The ingredients were good, but not great.  I will say the bleu cheese is of excellent quality.  A good, solid salad.  I ordered the ribeye and my wife got the filet with a bleu cheese topping.  I was surprised by the quality of the ribeye.  Not much marbling and just not a great cut.  My wife's filet on the other hand was fantastic.  The crust was excellent as well.  This steak was superb.  The garlic mashed on the side were also excellent.  The wine list is reasonable but not extensive.    Overall, it was the experience we hoped for.  You can get better food at a lot of places in town, but it was a wonderful night.",

    "text": "From beginning to end, this was a fantastic meal that was only outdone by the fantastic service. From the second we walked down the stairs, we were catered to as if we were royalty. My wife was given a rose at the front desk. We were seated immediately, and within moments, our server was taking our drink order. I chose a Manhattan and I am barely joking when I tell you that the pour was seven fingers with the portion that couldn't fit in the martini glass nicely stored in a bucket of ice for me. We then moved on to the appetizers of crab cakes and Gorgonzola stuffed portobello mushrooms. Both were delicious. Up next was the salad service, which was a True treat. Your server comes to the table and puts together your salad with whatever fixings you so desire. At this point we got to our main course of prime rib. The prime rib was so tender and so well cooked that a person with no teeth could have enjoyed it. The velvety touch of the cut was something you find so rarely these days. After our main course, they brought out a tray of chocolate dipped strawberries and figs which even a person like myself who was tragically born without a sweet tooth enjoyed. We ended the night with a cappuccino, which just was the final embellishment on a wonderful meal. I would have loved to try the bananas foster or cherries jubilee dessert, but one more ounce of food down my gullet and I might have died. I recommend reservations as this restaurant is very popular and after the service and quality of food I received, I can understand why they are so popular.",

I could easily have had a similar dinner at any one of a number of nicer properties in Las Vegas for $100 less than I paid at Hugo's. This restaurant, while nice, is simply overpriced for the venue (Four Queens on Fremont Street where street performers, zip lines and homeless people are just steps away outside the casino). I would expect to pay $250 for a nice meal at the Wynn or Encore or Bellagio, but not at the Four Queens. If I'm looking for a nice dinner out in Las Vegas in the future, I doubt I'll make reservations at Hugo's.",

Michael was our server and eloquently explained the menu. Hubs got the filet mignon and I ordered salmon. Both come with table side salad. Honestly this could have been my entire meal. About 11 items can be added to your salad. Everything from shrimp, onions, pine nuts, etc. Tremendous salad. Then lemon sorbet as an palate cleanser. Then our entree. My hubs also ordered a negroni.

I requested a reservation on the 21st at 5pm. I then asked if they had any vegan options on the menu. I was told about 3 options, which after asking what kind of plant based cheese was used on two of the options, I was told it was dairy cheese. Not vegan.   Then I was told the chef sometimes can come up with something the day of. Well, the day came and my mom and I were running late. I called to let them know we would be about 30 minutes late, they were very nice and told us to take our time. When we arrived the host I spoke to on the phone knew exactly who we were and referenced a vegan meal the chef had prepared for me. I felt so special, not only because they give every woman a rose as they enter the restaurant, but because the chef went out of his way to prepare an entire meal that isn't on the menu for anyone else.  The meal consisted of zucchini alfredo made with nuts, ratatouille, and a side of asparagus and carrots. I wasn't sure if the bread was vegan, and I don't think there was a clearly obvious vegan salad dressing choice, so I skipped out on both if those.  The wait staff was incredibly attentive until it started to get busy. It started taking a while to get someone's attention. We unfortunately didn't have time to get my moms birthday dessert. :[   All in all, I give this restaurant 5 stars. My mom used to come here with my dad, for years. He passed away 15 years ago and I'm so glad I got to experience their favorite place in Vegas with my mom.   Thank you Hugo's for being so kind and accommodating!",

If you're looking for old school fine dining and really want to feel like you're in an episode of Sopranos, hit up Hugo's. The environment is surprising, considering you are literally in the cellar underneath the loud, smoky world of table games and slots. The gentlemen at the door immediately greeted my wife with a rose, which was placed at the table when we were sat. I loved the entire experience, I loved how they built salads at the table, utilized a team of waitstaff to provide specialized care and truly a first class meal.

Not over interested in witty repartee but committed to serving you as rarely seen these days. They are tuxed' up and take their occupation serous whether your in a suit or cut-offs and flip flops. Traditional salad made at table by wait staff. Meat cart to select your cut after explaining. You want something special or different (like wife wanting blu cheese melted and torched on her steak) they accommodate. It's in the basement and you feel like your getting away with something and Joe Pesci May walk in at any moment. Steak was awesome (ribeye) spot on temp and well marbled. We got there a little early to purposely hang at the old school Bar and have high-ball. If you want the whole experience of Vegas - Hugo's baby. If you don't agree I will fight you.",

    "text": "We had planned on visiting Hugo Cellar with a group of co-workers that had gone to Vegas for the weekend. We decided to splurge [we can all splurge every once in a while] and enjoy this fine dinner. Splurge is the the best word to describe this place and not just because of the prices. The treatment is superior to your standard night out.   First the girls were presented with a rose. The host was very cordial and gives you some of the long history that Hugo Cellars has enjoyed. You can imagine Sinatra, Dean Martin and many of those personalities sitting in the same seat you may have sat tonight.   To start a Sommelier came to see about our wine list. Pretty simple so the girls got a bottle of white while I preferred a glass of red with my dinner. Rest of the boys had drinks.   We ordered our dinner as baskets of bread and butter were put on our table. Our waiter explained that the meals here are NOT al carte. It includes salad, the meal and dessert. As soon as we had ordered our meals the second waiter [we had two] came over and prepared our salads for us right at the table. Each of us got to pick our items which I was glad because some of the members of our group hardly put anything while I put in almost everything, including some anchovies. As soon as our salads were done, they came out with some small cones of lemon sorbet to cleanse the palate.   Dinner came out and it was prepared excellently. My beef wellington was super tender and delicious. I think we all had the garlic mashed potatoes which was a great choice. My wife and daughter ordered the rib-eye and both looked at the their dinners at the end of the meal and realized that they should have shared. Neither got to half their steak. Some guy on Fremont Street asked for some change and got about $80 in food. Its Vegas Baby!   After the meal, some desserts were brought out at no charge, they included some chocolate covered straweberries, some dried apricots dipped on a bed of chocolate and baby figs with some whip cream. But they also brought some upscale desserts that looked great but we were all stuffed.  They added 18% gratuity because we had a group of 7 which makes it easier anyways but if there was one complaint was that I handed the waiter $200 and put the rest of the groups meal on my credit card. There were some incorrect charges on my card as part of the cash was used to increase the tip. Don't know where the mistake happen so when I saw my bank statement I was preparing for a fight but the GM Richard said he would call me back the next day and he did just as he had promised. He was polite and resolved the issue quickly.",

I love that it's one of the last remnants of the old Downtown with a quaint underground feel, and lord, some of the best steaks and salad offerings in town. I've probably come 50 times and now I bring new friends and clients from time to time.  Except that I always run the risk of a super arrogant, dismissive host saying something offensive when we step to the entry. It's even worse on the phone IF there is no reservation available. Just incredibly snippy and arrogant. Over and over and over.  I think there are two different older gentlemen who take turns being particularly dismissive. When you call in and there is no reservation it's almost as if you're a fool for not booking sooner. Sometimes they act like they ARE Hugo.  Love, love, love this place and I'm not giving up any time soon. But I had a group of eight friends in town and I chose to go to Del Friscos just because I didn't want to risk being embarrassed or pissed off.  I like my steak medium rare. Can I get the host at medium arrogant?",

I have a favorite, off strip burger place I wanted to go to but my wife wanted to try Hugo Cellar so we compromised and did what she wanted.   This place is such an experience.  The rose at the door, old school look, the servers are not just good, they are personable, not robo-service that is fake.    The salad was fun, my Manhattan was kept chilled because the drink was huge I had it as an after dinner drink.    Then the steak.  Not dry aged so I can't compare it to dry aged steaks but one of the better I have had out.  And they cooked it perfect, black and Blue or Pittsburgh.  The only other place I have been that cooked it this perfect was actually called \"black and blue.\"  We tried the cherries jubilee and it was interesting. Not really my style dessert but part of the entire experience.   So wonderful meal, full belly, you walk out up the stairs and remember you were in this weird oasis in the middle of some crappy, old school casino with people smoking and weird smells.  And realize what they have to do to keep Hugo's Cellar so cool.   The only negative is they need Luxardo cherries for that Manhattan.",

They definitely know what they are doing and give great tips on what to order if you are perplexed. The salad was probably my favorite part of the meal- I could eat that ranch dressing at every meal. We got the escargot, which was great and very rich. The reason I'm not giving 4 stars is that I ordered the double filet with foie gras, as did my boyfriend, and his was rare but I couldn't tell the difference with my medium order. We were crunched for time so I didn't ask for them to fix it though, and I'm sure they would have. I am definitely coming back here, especially when we can take longer time.",

    "text": "My wife and I dined here to celebrate our two year wedding anniversary. If you want to step back in time and experience Las Vegas dining before the uber expensive restaurants on the strip started becoming the norm, come here. The restaurant is inside the Four Queens, a few steps down below from the bustling casino floor.   Once you get to the bottom of the stairs, you are presented with a dim, old school, romantic restaurant. We arrived 30 minutes early, but were seated right away. But before we started walking back to our table, my wife was presented with a very gorgeous long stemmed red rose, quite a nice touch for starting a romantic dinner.  We started with Hugo's Scampi to share and chose the Chateaubriand and lobster for two for our main course. For some reason, the appetizer took quite some time to come out. A number of servers did apologize a number of times for the wait. We were served our salad a short time later, still waiting on the appetizer. The appetizer showed up right when we finished our salads. The scampi was good, just a little confusing how four shrimp took so long to be served.  Our main course was served a few minutes after our appetizer was delivered. The Chateaubriand and lobster were presented on a large platter table side. The meat is sliced and the lobster removed from its shell. We ordered the chateau medium rare, but it was more towards medium/medium well, almost like it sat under a heat lamp for a little too long? Regardless, it was still tasty, just didn't make quite as big an impression as a chateau usually does.  We were presented with chocolate covered strawberries after our main course, but were given a small chocolate mousse cake by the chef for our anniversary. A very nice touch and the cake was absolutely delicious. We tried to finish the cake because it was so good, but at that point, we were ready to pass out from the meal. Thank you to the staff who paid attention to my reservation notes.",

The waiters are dressed nicely and the presentation of the food was very nice.  However, I just did not like my dinner, nor did my mother.  I felt as though my food was not very fresh, and I thought m hopes would be renewed for dessert with the strawberry plate but that wasn't fresh either.  In all my years, I won't be back because I am just afraid of spending top dollar again and having the same experience and I can not afford that.

For the main course two of us had Prime Rib and two had steaks that were aged and cooked to perfection not a single complaint all night. When the bill came the bartender had put two cocktails for another table on our bill and were apologetic and quick to remove them, it appears to be an honest mistake.

The prices are high and the food was mediocre at best. The service was just meh - maybe because I came in a group of 12 so they knew they were getting their guaranteed gratuity. I got the Beef Wellington, it came out overdone and was definitely nothing to write home about. The worst part, though, was the table-side salad service. For a party of 12 it is just ridiculous to hear the same set of toppings-related questions twelve times! The salads ended up looking like something you'd find in a school cafeteria anyway.

We came here for an intimate dinner before seeing a show at the Smith Center and were wowed every single minute of our meal.  The food starting with the artichoke and spinach dip (+crab meat) was outstanding! The crab was tender and they didn't jip us on the crab meat! Just enough without taking away from the taste of the dip. The salad is great! I had the creamy pepper dressing (similar to ranch) and it was delicious. Made to your liking... awesome! By the time our actual entree came we were ready! I had the Veal Oscar which is perfection. If you like veal or want to try it, get this dish! Also, your meal comes with chocolate dipped fruit, and IT IS GOOD. But if you are too much like me and my boyfriend you'll get a cheesecake to send you over the edge! Absolutely delicious and creamy.  Our drinks were great, they even serve you a whole drink and pour it in the rocks for you so you're actually getting enough alcohol. Hard to find in Las Vegas.  The presentation of everything is divine. A rose for every Lady to put on your table. The servers and wait staff are extremely pleasant. Oscar and Carlos were wonderful they really are a great representation of this restaurant.  Would absolutely recommend this place over and over again. Loved every minute of it. A great meal and beautiful ambiance, the Old Las Vegas feel is all over this great underground nook.  Great for date night or even a girl's night! Love this place!",

The table side side salad is the best!!!! enjoyed the service a lot and pricing is very good for the quality of their product, same goes to their wine list, good and priced right! Personally, I like duck and that is what I ordered....very good!  My only suggestions to management at Hugo's is the fact they do not split tickets at the table, they take two credit cards but they do not split bills, that is not very consumer friendly EVERY restaurant does it but they don't....making VERY complicated for a group to figure out who is what! Every POS has the facility, I think they are just difficult!  Will be back just because of the quality of the food and service!!!!",

It was supposed to be a touch of class, upscale, romantic, elegant restaurant, but it is not even close to that. First it's located underground of 4 Queens old casino, and with old (fake) brick wall, musty smell of a carpet and decor and stuffed with the cigarette smoke coming from the casino, the whole place is more kitschy and tacky that anything else (even more with roses for ladies at the entrance). Secondly, food is far too overpriced. $62 for seafood trio consisting of 2 shrimps, 2 scallops, 1 crab cake. The crab cake tasted so weird, (couldn't identified spices in it) and a lobster bisque was too salty. To make long story short, this was our first, last and never again time.",

First off the dress code is not upheld so that was the first disappointment as we had dressed up and were expecting a very nice dinner experience.  Some people were dressed in just a printed tee shirt and jeans. That would be okay if you were going to a low end restaurant but was not expecting that. The ladies are given a nice red rose that was a nice touch. We had waited a very long time before our waiter actually took our order.  They didn't have any fresh off the menu special.  We had the shrimp cocktail and it was very good would have it again.  The table side prepared dinner salad was actually the best part of the dinner.  As for the food when it arrived that is where the biggest disappointment was, we had ordered two of the ribeye and they were not good!  It looked like something you would get from Denny's and only pay $12-$15 and not $58 the others had a New York steak and the Duck and it was not bad.  They do provide a nice deserts platter after the dinner and that was very nice and fresh.  I am sure many years ago this place was top notch but it has definitely had better days.",

Limp lettuce and canned artichokes, etc. The steak (filet mignon and powerhouse) were average at best...something you'd get at a family style restaurant in the suburbs someplace. We then had to practically beg for the check to get out of there. I would not return.",

    "text": "I'd like to pretend I was savvy enough on my own to figure out that Hugo's would be a good spot to visit during our visit to Vegas, but a friend recommended we check it out.  We were a bit leery of what the \"business casual\" attire meant for us (friends of ours were not seated at a different restaurant on the strip the day before), but our basic assumptions for what it meant held up:  don't wear flip flops or clothes with holes.  Hugo's might be less of a sleeper than it used to be, but it's still pretty surprising that you can find a $5 craps table under the same roof as this amazing place.  A visit to this restaurant was not just a meal, but a True experience.  John the sommelier's charm and fun storytelling was one of the highlights, along with the rest of the great service and impeccable dishes.  This place is a pleasant relic of days past, legitimized by the longstanding tenure of the staff (several of them have been there for decades, they had said).  Some of the other unique features included custom tableside salads and the fact that the meals here are actual full meals (salad/sorbet palate cleanser/choc covered fruit for dessert), not just the \"a la carte\" one might expect at a higher end restaurant.  Also, there are no meat portions smaller than 10 oz, so don't expect dainty plates.  Steaks and seafood stuck out on the menu, and our server's suggestion to add a half order of the \"Queen's Lobster\" was a great one, as I paired this with the 10 oz NY strip.  The steak was great, the lobster was even better, and there was even a special dessert dish brought out to us since we got married the day before.  This was the one stop we had on our list on Fremont Street, and it was well worth the trip.",

    "text": "One of the better kept secrets of Las Vegas, you'd probably never know about this place unless a friend told you about it (like me!).  Tucked underneath the Four Queens Hotel in downtown Las Vegas, this place is the ultimate old school \"wine and dine\" your woman joint (complete with a complimentary rose for the lady).  One of the things I like most about this place is that you actually have a snowflakes chance in hell of bringing your own wine to enjoy here (as long as you're cool to the sommelier and don't make a scene about it).  No chance of doing this on the Strip.  Did I mention \"old school\"?  They bring the salad cart to the table and prepare it a la Lawry's style right in front of you.  Beware of eating too much of this as it's definitely a meal in itself.  The steaks here are aged just right and don't disappoint.  The lamb is excellent as well.  I tried a bite of the sea bass once and it was pretty damn good.  The service is impressive and don't be surprised if you get someone who's practically lived and worked there his entire life.  It's really cozy (get a booth), schedule plenty of time here to relax and enjoy your meal, and get to know your server as they have all sorts of stories to share w/ you if you wish.  Definitely an older crowd plus a lot of regulars so if you want glam, stick to the Strip....but if you want a unique old school Vegas experience, this is definitely it.  Pricing is what you'd expect for LV but maybe a little cheaper.  Make a reservation in advance for sure, especially if you're coming from the Strip.  Nothing sucks worse than paying taxi fare only to find you're paying another taxi the same on the way back hungry.",

I am not sure the scene is for me but the saving grace is definitely Hugo's Cellar.  This place was packed with a variety of folks and the atmosphere was classic and romantic.  It definitely looked like it had not been updated in 20 years with the blue tableclothes and blue tapestry on the chairs.  I took my rose as I walked in the door and we were seated on time for our reservation.    All in all, the food was good...not mind blowing but good.  It is honestly more about the atmosphere than the food and that is what we wanted on the first night of our trip.  I loved, loved the tableside salad.  It was purely delicious with creamy peppercorn dressing and all of my favorite toppings.  I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing so that I could enjoy my entree.  My husband had the Filet Atlantis and I had the Seabass prepared with crab and shrimp sauce.  Mine was alright but I would probably go for the meat if you dine here.  My husband's steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and had a nice flavor.  Being from Texas, we get good meat all the time and while his steak was good, it was not the best cut I have had.    We finished our meal with the complimentary chocolate dipped strawberries that were divine!  Oh, and another great thing is that the wine list is priced extremely well.  The value far exceeds most restaurants in Vegas.  We ordered an $85 bottle of Jordan Cabernet, which is a steal in a restaurant.  And, the Sommilier was quite charming with his British accent and all.  If you are looking for something different from the strip, Hugo's is a good call.",

The hotel is kind of old and dinky and as I walked by the Subway and TCBY signs I was definitely wondering, \"Where the HECK are we going?\"   But once there I was so pleasantly surprised! The ambience is great. The welcome rose was a hit for sure! The food was definitely a bit pricey, but you get sooo much for it (and compared to the rest of Vegas a steal).  My bf and I aren't huge eaters so we just shared an appetizer and one entree. The bread and cheese toasted lavash was really good and of course they refill it as soon as you are done. Also, they must have some job description as \"water-filler\" because I don't think my glass of water was ever more than 1\" from the rim! They just kept refilling it, after a while I had to stop drinking water or else I wouldn't have had room for the food.  The hot marble slab appetizer (with 2 pieces of filet, 2 pieces of swordfish, 2 pieces of chicken, and 4 shrimps) was SO amazingly good. I don't know how they get everything to cook so soft and tender when they do it right in front of you. The selection just must be very quality.  The salad that comes with the meal = awesome! I loved the idea of making food in front of you and they do it was such bravado. Our entree was the shrimp scampi and well it was so yummy, but I was trying to save room for the dessert! Complimentary raspberry sorbet and chocolate dipped apricot, figs, and strawberries with fresh cream.  Overall I have to say it was such a great and fun experience that made me forget I was in flash Las Vegas.  Thanks yelp! My bf said he chose it from here :D and I am so glad I got to go.",

Yes it is nice to have a salad made at your table with your choice of fixings and dressings, but unfortunately that also limits your selection.  For example, they only have three types of dressing, I would prefer that  a nice generic salad be made in the kitchen where they could have serveral type of dressing available.",

Okay, it was mainly the amazing salad (mixed at your table, to your specifications) that grabbed our attention. But, the rest of the meal and spirits were great as well.  Well, from what I can remember (in between shots of Patron), I had a great salad and steak. The salad (did I mention it was amazing?!) was fabulous. Okay, maybe it was just the alcohol was talking at this point, but we all thought the salad was wonderful! Besides being made in individual portions and with whatever we liked, it was tossed thoroughly and not overwhelming in the dressing department at all. My steak was cooked well, seasoned just right, and helped combat the alcohol demons coursing through my veins at the time. Just remember that saying, \"Beer before liquor...\"  Like many of the other reviews state, this place is kitschy and 'old school' in terms of the decor. Set in the basement of the Four Queens Hotel in downtown Las Vegas, this place is something straight out of a 50s, 60s, or 70s movie. It's rather dark inside, but that only serves to heighten the mood: cool and chill. I felt like a high-roller in this place. It's classy and sophisticated...even though you're in the heart of Sin City itself! Service was top-notch and overall, we had a spectacular meal.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good food and doesn't mind having to travel 'off the strip' in order to get it.",

An impressive hunk o' cow was carved at our table, the lobster tails were de-shelled and the veggies were plated in front of us from a silver platter. My only minor whine is the food should have been a little hotter and the beef was slightly undercooked, but everything tasted great.    Love the rose they give the ladies, the tableside salad service is fun and the serving is very generous, and the dessert plate at the end with chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots was a classy and unique finish.  We prefer slightly sweet wines and the sommelier recommended a wonderful Reisling that we thoroughly enjoyed.  A very retro 70's atmosphere with brick walls and romantic lighting and oil paintings on the walls. The service from our wait staff was quite good as well.  A much better value than most steak shops located on the Strip (with the exception of The Steak House at Circus Circus, which is still the best in town IMHO).",

Dinners range from 40 to 60 bucks but that is misleading because you get a Huge table side salad where you pick the toppings + bread + 2 sides + sorbet to cleanse your palate + dessert sampler = Great bang for your buck.  Recommend hitting the mob museum for a few hours then dinner here for another few hours and you have a whole night of entertainment!",

ATMOSPHERE: Romantic but a bit \"old.\" Most people there are in their 40's - 60's, but don't let that stop you from going. Try to get a booth if you're there with your significant other to make the meal more romantic :)  FOOD: Wonderful! I ordered the sea bass which was slightly seared and served on top of crab meat and shrip. My bf ordered the duck with wild rice and he absolutely loved it! The great thing is, included in your meal is a salad (made in front of you), a palate cleanser (lemon sorbet) and dessert (chocolate covered strawberries, apricots, and figs). They actually make part of the meat and some of the dessert table side, which is fun.  SERVICE: Great! Service usually makes or breaks my dining experience, and the service here was top notch.   OVERALL: Great atmosphere, food, and service. Not much more you can ask for!",

    "text": "This restaurant came highly recommended, but I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about! Our party of five wanted a nice dinner after a long week of work in Vegas. We went to the Four Queens Casino in old Vegas and followed the stairs down to Hugo's Cellar. We were greeted by the hostess and the ladies were given red roses. Nice touch, except now red roses remind me of death, after V for Vendetta. Anyway, we were promptly seated. The restaurant was busy but there was no line. The waiter seemed annoyed that only two of the five of us ordered drinks. I might have ordered a glass of wine but I just can't justify spending nearly $20 on A drink. We told the waiter we were all going to share some appetizers (to start). The salads are made fresh at the table and are $19 each. (No, the croutons were not golden.) I said we would share a few. He was totally put off... OH NO, you can't share the salads... we would have to charge you. Heck, I thought that's what the $19 was?? Anyway, the salads were tasty (I snuck a bite of my dad's when the waiter wasn't looking) but small. The crab cakes were average, the shrimp was DELICIOUS and the blue cheese stuffed mushrooms were tasty but strong. We were still really hungry but not enjoying the ambiance enough to warrant spending $50+ a plate, so we decided to get our check. All in all, we were in and out in 30 minutes, and spent over $100 (pre tax/tip) on 2 side salads, 3 appetizers, and 2 domestic beers, so Hugo's should not have been annoyed at the quick table turn, yet they seemed almost hostile that we left after appetizers.",

After asking the waiter how to order the steak for it to be pink we were told medium. The medium ribeye came with no pink.  We sent it back and the waiter rudely asked if anyone else had a problem with their food. He said he took it off the bill as we didn't want to order something else at that point.  The bill came with a $19 charge for the salad that came with the meal.  When the manager was called over he told us it was because she ate the salad. Really?   Salad that comes included with the meal is $19 when your steak is over cooked???  And the manager argued with us when we said we didn't feel we should pay $19 for the salad.  Eventually he agreed to take the salad off the bill but as he walked away he said \"really\"?   I have never been treated so poorly in such a beautiful restaurant.   What a shame.",

    "text": "We went down to Fremont Street because we were doing a Classic Vegas weekend. After realising our party was under-dressed for the steakhouse at the top of Binion's (turns out they frown on guys in shorts, even with good shoes and decent button-up shirts - Sorry about dressing for 100+ degree heat!), we wondered around just trying to find anything (turns out one in our group turned out to be kinda picky). I had \"a feeling\" for the 4 Queens, so we went in there and found Hugo's Cellar.   Sheer Perfection.   Great Style (You enter by going down a staircase. The brightly-lit hussle-bussle of the casino disappears as you descend into nice subdued lighting, beautiful brick and wooden pillars),    Old World Hospitality (the ladies all received long stemmed red roses and were seated by the staff),   Good sized Portions ( the drinks, from the bar that seat 5, come in 1/2litre carafes in little ice buckets, so you're getting about 2+ drinks for the price of 1).  Our service was over the top outstanding. Eddie, our congenial bartender fixed superb drinks, from uber-standards, The Manhattan and The Cosmopolitan, to the faddish Raspberry Chocolate Martini. Sue was at the podium as Matre'D. She optimized great service with her balance of candor and professionalism.  I've had lots of good food and I thought the food here was very good. The table side salads were all done in the same bowl; so you're right, it's not going to be pure flavor of your particular choices. Eh, we all thoroughly enjoyed our salads anyway.  Two of us are Veg; you might be surprised by the great meals made from just veggie sides at your typical high end steakhouse. Hugo's didn't disappoint and they fixed up quite decent plates for us. Others in our group had the swordfish and a porterhouse. Everyone was pleased with their meal.  At the end of the meal they brought us chocolate covered strawberries; each one was about the size of your fist. Interestingly, we had had fist-size chocolate-dipped strawberries the night before at a wedding reception and had been impressed then.  And yet, the ones at Hugo's were bigger and sweeter.  Crazy...  Hugo's has become a permanent stop every time we come to Vegas.",

    "text": "4.5 Stars... Really, really good, but not *quite* \"as good as it gets\" because of a few small flaws which may have been flukes.  (Plus if I leave an empty star spot, my boyfriend whose favorite place in the world this is may take me back again to try it again in hopes of me being able to up my review, teehee!)  We came on a date here on our first trip to Vegas together, and it was an amazing experience all around.    We had reservations so when we arrived we were promptly seated after my being greeted with a long stem red rose (which they do for all their women guests).  It's located beneath the  Four Queens Casino, and it's fun and a bit impressing to walk down the steps out of the noisy casino into the relative calm of the restaurant.   The atmosphere is dark, elegant, romantic, and classic feeling.   The service was top-notch:  friendly, personable, just the right amount of refined to make you feel like you're eating somewhere fancy but not so much that you feel they're talking down to you, and on top of their game from start to finish.   The sommelier  was the same one that boyfriend remembers seeing when he came with his parents in his youth.   He was very nice and knowledgeable so I really hate to say this, but he ultimately ended up steering us into an off-menu wine that we *liked* but didn't *love* and that was significantly more expensive than the wines we had been looking at.   That's part of the missing half-star.  It was my first table-side custom salad experience and I am now sold on it and think every restaurant should have one.  I ended up with a bed of greens topped with shrimp, hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, pickled red onion, blue cheese, pine nuts, caesar dressing, and parmesan.   There were lots of other toppings that I passed on, but I don't remember what they were - sorry.  I just remember these because it surprisingly ended up being one of the best salads I've eaten and I've duplicated it at home several times now.  We ordered the Escargot as a starter, and it was melt in your mouth delicious. I love that they served it in an escargot dish surrounded by the perfect amount of sauce with the puffed pastry on top.  It made for a much cleaner presentation and easier to eat, rather than having to fish around in a sea of butter to fish out what may be a mushroom or an escargot.  Easier for those who are slightly squeamish about the idea of eating snails too:  less interaction and more enjoying the flavors.  This dish was beautifully balanced, light, savory, and just perfection.  For our entrees we ordered the New York Strip, and the Rack of Lamb (and we split them).  The portions were generous and they both came with large sides of beautifully cooked vegetables and creamy mashed potatoes.  The rack of lamb was cooked to perfection and was such a treat.  I loved the Indonesian style sauce that came with it, but the boyfriend preferred it without - which was fine because the sauce was on the side.  I would definitely order this dish again and highly recommend it.    The New York steak was good - very good, but this is where it fell a bit flat for me.  I have to admit here that I've had better steaks that I've made at home - mind you, I've made some VERY NICE prime steaks at home so I'm a pretty hard sell.  Don't get me wrong, It was very good but not quite as good as it gets, so this is the other fraction of a missing star.  I did enjoy every bite of it (eventually, bc there were tons of leftovers lol).  NEXT TIME I plan on ordering the duck - apparently that's all they served when it first opened and everything else has been added over the years, so I'm betting they've got that down to perfection by now.  (And the boyfriend is going to order the lamb again and I'm going to make him share it with me.)  After the meal they brought out a plate of complementary chocolate dipped fruits which was a very pleasant surprise and also the perfect 'little bit of something sweet but not too heavy because I just pigged-da'hell-out' end to the meal.  All in all it was one of the favorite meals I've ever eaten. If I was reviewing a less expensive restaurant it would definitely be five stars - but given its price level my expectations are extremely high.  Even so, it only fell the teeniest bit short of absolute perfection and I can't wait to come back and have a 5th star wooed out of me.  :)",

    "text": "This is usually one of our go to's when we're in Vegas.  The food is probably the best meal you'll get in downtown.  You definitely can't miss the salad cart, and if you want a steak, they make a good one.  I've more recently experienced some of their chicken dishes which I actually prefer over their steaks.  For dessert, we've had the Cherries Jubilee and Bananas Foster, both are great but I'd lean towards the Bananas Foster.  The only real issue with Hugo's is in the last 10 years the service has gone downhill.  It's not terrible but just not as attentive as it used to be.  There are better restaurants in Vegas at this price point but if you're going on a date and want some old school Vegas feel, this is a great restaurant.  We're likely to go back every time we're in Vegas and hopefully it will pick back up to the level it used to be.",

    "text": "My friends and I traveled to Vegas for an annual guys' trip and decided to check out Hugo's Cellar, hearing so many great things about it.  We certainly got a night that we will never forget... we arrived roughly 20 minutes before our reservation and asked to be seated early and they said it would be a few short minutes.     It turned out to be about 20 minutes, which we normally would not have cared about, but in the restaurant waiting area, we weren't alone.   We were with... the smell.   A cheap potpourri fragrance that my 89 year old grandmother would find offensive and just a hint of smoke became the topic of conversation all evening.  We tried to talk about sports and anything to distract us, but we couldn't ignore this scent.  It had effects on all of us.     Our friend Adam, who is usually a very nice man, completely snapped and yelled at his friends and stormed out, with the smell affecting his mood and well-being.  It even gave our friend Brooks diarrhea, which was another unfortunate incident for him, but welcomed for us.    We then were finally able to sit down at a very lovely table in the old-school, classy restaurant.  We were treated to a lovely and generous assortment of breads which we ate with aggression and stuffed in our nose to try to wash our nose hairs of the clinging scent.  Amongst the breads was a toasted lavish that was inseminated with cheese that was just delightful.    Also in the breads was... ahhhhh... I'm sorry I just can't stop thinking about that smell and how pungent and poisonous it was.    We then ordered our drinks and we were very pleased by portions and quality of the dirty martinis.  There were at least 2 helpings per serving and it helped dull our senses and killed some of the brain cells that held our memories of the smell, but not all of them of course, it was just too overpowering.    Our friend Kevin ordered a Gin and Tonic and it was such a special cocktail that they spent 45 minutes preparing it until he was eventually served it right before he polished off his steak.  He couldn't enjoy as much bread as us because he was afraid of choking on it due to the lack of fluids in his mouth to help digest the carbohydrates.  But he said it was worth the wait.  ... I can't get that smell out of my head.  Then it was time for the salad cart.   This was a very cool idea and felt classy to build our own salad to our liking.  I opted for the traditional oil and vinegar with all the trimmings and I enjoyed it immensely.  Many of our friends went with the fishy dressing, at least that is what I believe it was called.   I believe it was a sort of trout/salmon/seaweed mixture that tasted like the ocean at low tide, if you enjoy that sort of thing.  It's only redeeming quality is the fact that the fishy taste infiltrated our nasal passages as well, to help put the smell out of our minds, at least for the time being.     Then we had our main course and many of us opted for steak.   I'm sure it was good, but honestly, I can't remember.   The smell did so much more than penetrate my large Italian nose, it also cause a rift between me and my friend/partner Adam.  Adam, if you are reading this right now, I'm sorry.   I hated that smell, but if you ever want to go back, I'd go with you.  I choose you.  Always. Forever.  Can we please go somewhere else.  Ok fine you win, let's go to Hugo's.  But we are not showing up early.",

Salad is included with the meal and it's made tableside. Same with the dinner carbs - choice of rice, potatoes, etc. is included with the meal. This makes my decisions less complicated.  + The desert that is again part of the meal was really a nice touch - especially the figs!  It on the old Vegas Strip - downstairs away from the hustle just a few feet away. I'd definitely go back.",

We also tried their Kona Coffee (prepared via a vacuum coffee maker at table side) and Cherry Jubilee - so good but we must admit we were way over stuffed by the time we walked out ! Our servers Michael/Anthony were GREAT ! It was a great dining experience :)",

The service from start to finish is over-the-top excellent.  we have gone here once a year, every year for the past 15 years.  We have the same sommelier every year and he has never steered us wrong on wines.  The starter salad alone is amazing and delicious. I love that the price of each meal includes the salad, starch and veggies (it's not all a la carte -- which bugs me).   the portions are so huge that you can easily split a meal and leave more than satisfied.  This place is great all around.  Cannot recommend highly enough.",

Went again last night for my 56th birthday with a party at four, we were seated immediately, and had our drinks within five or so minutes of sitting down at the table. Gene & Victor we're our waiter and they were great!!! Victor was marvelous helping us with our drink orders and Gene was a great waiter as well.  I will continue coming back again and again love this place And the meals are all inclusive!! Which is rare to find at a good steak house that doesn't charge you $10 or more for a potato! The table side made to Salads here are amazing you get exactly what you want & don't have to pick out the stuff you don't like (I'm a picky eater!), sherbet (sorbet) cones come in between courses  and I've never been disappointed with a main course yet!  Then there's the platter of chocolate dipped fruit with creme fresh for dessert IF you don't order one of the other amazing desserts I always go with the banana foster cooked table side. HIGHLY RECOMMEND for any special occasions or just to enjoy s great meal!! It's \"Old style Vegas at its best!",

This is a review that could really go on and on so I'm gonna try to cut myself short.  There is nothing that I don't like about Hugo's Cellar.  The service is superb, the food is fantastic, and it reminds me of other \"old school\" Vegas gourmet rooms that are no longer around.  The table-side salad service is fantastic and whatever you order on the menu is gonna be delicious.  Remember to save room for Bananas Foster (prepared table-side) after dinner and a cup of great coffee.   You might be surprised, but you won't be disappointed!",

That was the highlight of the dinner. I ordered the Sea Bass ($59) and my wife ordered the Seafood Trio ($62). My Sea Bass had a frozen taste to it and it was like eating a sponge No taste whatsoever,  My wife's entree was similar. I sent mine back and ordered a filet instead,  as I was not willing to try their seafood again. The filet was good... not great. We came to Hugo's because of the great tradition of excellence in service and food. Neither is present anymore as the service was just ok. When I spend $200 on dinner for two people, I really expect a much better food experience. No more Hugo's for us.",

There were warm smiles everywhere. We arrived exactly on time for our reservation and were seated immediately after being handed a rose. Once seated, we had several gentleman serve us. There were 4 to be exact, although I can only remember 3 names: Rashard, Oscar and Dave. All four were kind and humored us quiet a bit.  First, Rashard came and asked us what we would like to drink. (TIP: it's an open bar charge of $10... We didn't know this or we would have taken advantage lol). I got wine and my boyfriend got whiskey. Both delicious. The server who brought the wine was very knowledgable and funny (can't remember name). The salad done by Rashard was delicious! I asked for the honey dressing that they had and, my goodness, it was delectable, my boyfriend got the same dressing and also loved it.  Oscar came by next to give us raspberry sorbets in cute little cones to help cleanse. He too cracked a few jokes and was very friendly (our favorite 2 servers were Rashard and Oscar for their humor). Next the entrees served by Dave. I ordered the filet mignon and my boyfriend had the queen lobster. Both were seasoned perfectly and cooked just right. We didn't have room for dessert although they do bring complementary desserts which are a few fruits covered in chocolate. Overall, it was a great experience and I definitely recommend it to everyone! Just be ready to drop anywhere from $175-$275 for 2 people. It's worth it though!",

The ambiance of the restaurant and decor was nice. Unfortunately some of the staff was really loud. They do a cool made to order salad at your table and the waiter doing it really seemed to enjoy his job. But he was so super loud and obnoxious. The salad was cool, but just not very tasty. The dinner was about $100 per person, I tried the Filet & the Lobster Tail. Portions were very good, but honestly I've had better steak at Sizzler and the Lobster tail was worth $12.99 not $80 for two. Probably won't go back, but it wasn't a horrible experience, just not worth what I paid.",

Looking at the menu online - I thought it was very pricey - but it turned out to be fairly priced - because everything was included - full meal -  from fancy breads, to custom made tableside salads, entree with sides, sorbet and chocolate covered strawberries for desert all included for the price of an entree. Plus the portions were large.  Food was really delicious.  The first time I had the scallops which were excellent, and this past time I had grilled Ahi - which was such an enormous portion - I took it back from Vegas in my cooler and had it the next night with dinner - it was amazing! Awesome wine list too. Generous cocktails with overpour!  Service was very good. Ambiance was very dark and comfy. It seemed that several of the diners around us were locals - not visitors - so that you  know is a good sign!",

Well, apparently this chick knows now.  I came for a friend of my cousin's birthday.  At first glimpse, this place seems a bit cramped.  True to it's name (cellar), you go down stairs to get to this little place.  The lobby area is a bit small, so if it gets crowded, it may only  be standing room only.  Once we were seated, each girl was brought to the table and given a long stemmed red rose.  I know, cheesy ... but it was cute nonetheless.  They have a great selection of seafood and meat.  First course was salad.  Their salad was delicious, and I probably could have just made the salad my whole meal.  Not a side salad.  This baby takes up your whole plate, and comes with all the fixings.  Of course, you get to pick which fixings you want on it.  I also had some of their bread.  I especially enjoyed the lavosh.  It was crispy and flaky, and something different from the ordinary bread given at restaurants, although that was served as well.  After much deliberation, I chose the filet mignon. Very tender, juicy, and well cooked (medium rare, just the way I like it).  I was pleased with my choice.  I also got to try the Escargot en Croute.  It was my first time tasting escargot, so I really don't have anything to compare it to.  However, I know I liked it, and will be willing to have it again.  If you're in the mood to be fancy, hit this place up.  However, it is definitely on the pricey side.  For me, great to try once on my dime, but I hope next time it'll be on someone else's.",

    "text": "The ambiance and charm of Hugo's Cellar is what makes it a new favorite of mine. My husband and I were celebrating the day we met 7 years ago, and wanted to go somewhere different and special. Hugo's Cellar was my choice.   I loved every bit of the decor and style of the restaurant. It felt like it had been there forever, and that there was good reason for it. Vegas is so quick to demolish the old and put a new spin on everything, so I just love the coziness Hugo's exudes.   We were greeted with sincerity, and I was given a rose as we were walked back to our table. I already knew what I wanted from studying all the Yelp photos and reading the reviews prior to arrival.  I ordered a Greygoose Orange Cosmopolitan, my husband had the Franciscan Cabernet. We started with shrimp cocktail (pass on this!), had the table side salads that were included with our entrees (my husband exclaiming it was the best salad he's had in his whole life- LOL!), I ordered the small prime rib med rare (yum) with a 1/2 lb. of king crab legs (omg yum), and my husband had the beef Wellington med rare. We were happy with everything we ordered. I found the food to not have much salt on it; which is a good thing if you're more health conscious, or prefer to add it yourself. My crab legs were pre split and fat with meat. Yum. - I love crab legs! I couldn't finish all my prime rib, so it was boxed to go.   We saw a neighboring table order the bananas foster for dessert, and while it looked and smelled wonderful, we didn't have enough room. We shared a berry custard torte which was really good. After dinner it was fun to walk off our big meal and take in all the lights of the downtown area.   Overall, we really enjoyed our meal at Hugo's Cellar. There are a lot of fantastic restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas, but if you're looking for something special with your someone special, look no further.  This is it.",

We ordered single malt scotch and wine to drink respectively and were impressed how generous they were with the drinks.  The house Cab was just average, but they brought me a HIGHBALL full of Macallan for the single shot price, which was nice.  We both ordered the salad cart, which was awesome.  The dressings were not too heavy and the selection of veggies to compose your salad from was outstanding.  For dinner, I ordered the 16 ounce NY Strip med rare with the blue cheese creme topping.  The wife got Hugos chicken and we both got special vegetables.  A few cool things about Hugos - First the setting is great, quaint little brick basement with low ceilings and a 70s feel - they bring you sorbet between courses to cleanse the palate.  When we told them it was our anniversary, they brought us a little Luxor-shaped mousse with a candle.  Very cool.  Also, as has been mentioned many times, every lady gets a single rose.  My wife was so tickled by it she brought it home to Denver on the plane.  So, in summary,  good food and fun ambiance.  Go do it once if you want good food on Fremont.",

Every woman is given a red rose at the door. They have dishes you don't often see anymore such as Veal Oscar and Beef Wellington. The service is impeccable, the food is heavenly and I love the little touches, such as sorbet to cleanse the palate, chocolate covered fruit after dinner and hot washcloths. I just can't rave enough about this place! Going back already next Sunday!!!",

    "text": "Took my wife there for a romantic dinner following a week long trade show. Her only request was \"somewhere nice with Beef Wellington\". After an extended wait for entrees, with empty wine glass in hand and watching tables that were seated after us receive their meals, we were finally presented with our steaks. Upon cutting into her's the wife realized the pastry portion of the Wellinton was still doughy and the steak very very rare. My prime rib was one of the fattiest cuts that I have ever encountered. I realize that Prime rib is a marbled cut but this was mostly fat! Entrees were accompanied by overcooked veggies and lackluster mashed potatoes. We seemed to have no less than 3 people waiting on us at one time or another, at least until the steaks were served, yet none bothered to ask how was our meal and thus couldn't complain. My wife peeled off the dough and ate the outer, more done portion of the steak.  I would have had another glass of wine but never got the chance to order one. Had to basically tackel \"a\" server for the 2nd glass prior to the entrees.  Never saw the servers again until we disgustedly asked for the check. The only high points were the salad prepared tableside and the shrimp cocktail. Hence the 2-Star score for Food.  Sub-par Service and Food. Very disappointed considering the choices we had in Vegas.",

The restaurant has cheesy fake floral arrangements covered in dust greeting you at every table.    The waiters were a bit slow, but earned points for trying really hard to impress you with their knowledge.  The salad cart that so many people mention is about as gimmicky as unlimited salad and breadsticks at the Olive garden.   My sister and I almost walked out, but like the ending of a bad movie, wanted to see what might possibly come next.  I seriously question the credibility of all the 5 star reviewers on this list.",

Walking into the cellar they presented me a rose which is a nice touch but after that it was all uneventful.  This is not a Four Seasons dinning experience( Four Season in Philadelphia).  They poured us bottled water and put out lavash and hard cold bread.  We ordered our meal quickly and it was a long time before they came over with the salad cart.  Nice idea but  would have been nicer on a cold plate.  The salad dressing was unremarkable.  The next course was a intermezzo in a cone(very cute)but the tray could have been cleaner. My husband asked to have a glass of Cabernet with his dinner and the waiter came over when his meal was 75% completed and asked him what he would enjoy. Really you even have a sommelier with a tastevin. The steak came out done perfectly executed  but the side vegetables were like mush. Then it was time for dessert which was a nice touch, strawberries, figs and apricots dipped in chocolate. Not one time were we approached till the end while we were walking out did they ask if our dinners were acceptable.  They were not even crowded. Overall it was just okay....prefer Fleming's or Morton's.",

It's in the Four Queens which meant we had to walk through a huge line waiting for the $7.99 Prime Rib at the restaurant next door.  This should have been my first clue this wouldn't be the steak I was looking for.  The atmosphere is very old school and probably good for your parents anniversary but not great if you're under 40.  But I was here for the meat so it wasn't really an issue.  The first problem though was the beer list wasn't very extensive (mostly domestics) and the server didn't know much about the imports.  My buddy ended end with a wheat beer with apple flavor which was not something he wanted.  Mine was a Samuel Smith Pale Ale which was quite good.  I ordered a medium rare New York Strip with a warm center and a crisp exterior and my friend tried the salmon.  First was a salad they prepare table side but it lacked flavor.  The steak was a little better but still not the mind blowing experience I was looking for at $50 a steak.  The salmon was also run of the mill.",

A high end restaurant with amazing food, salad that is custom made at your table and dessert included in the basement of the Four Queens? It's True!!! This hidden gem in downtown Las Vegas will blow your mind! Steak cooked to perfection, seafood like it's just been caught and don't forget the bananas foster made table side. Women are greeted with roses and the decor will make you feel like you are in the background of the Godfather! Request the Sommelier to get expert advice on wine pairings (try the 2006 Meyers Cabernet if still available) or be adventurous and let the chef select your meal. If you are like me and like to share dishes with your date, just order your own meal and divide the portions yourself. A \"split/marry\" will run you an extra $25 and afford you an extra serving of veggies only. All around 5 star experience! Don't miss Hugos Cellar!",

We had reservations and were promptly seated. The service was slow and our waiter forgot to bring the drinks we ordered not once but twice. The salad cart was presented and was an uninspired performance by the waiter, it was just a job to make the salad---go-hum just another salad for a group of tourists. After a wait of about an hour after ordering our food it arrived hot and correct. We had a party of four and 3 of the 4 meals were good (not great ) and the fourth meal was a steak that was so full of gristle it could not be eaten. When we brought it to the attention of our waiter he basically blew us off, when we pressed our dissatisfaction with the steak for the second time he sent the manager over to our table, the manager reluctantly took the unbeaten steak off the bill but was obviously not happy about it. It was a marginal experience and I can not recommend Hugo's Cellar from a service standpoint, the food (3 out of 4 dishes) was good but not spectacular. There are too many other places in Vegas for fine dining.",

My husband had heard that Hugo's was a great steak place and we arranged to take our party there. We loved the atmosphere, so old Vegas! The roses were a nice touch, I especially like that there is a bud vase at your table so that your rose isn't just sitting on the table wilting (the waiter even wrapped the stems in foil before we left). We had Greg, Erik and Santiago assisting our table that evening and they were all stellar!! I had the Filet de Boeuf ~ Atlantis which was wonderful! The pace of the meal was what I really enjoyed. You would think with an appetizer, salad, sorbet, entree and the chocolate covered delights at the end you would be stuffed...the slow pace of the dinner helps!! Our bill was hefty, treating 4 people and ourselves to dinner, but worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY!! My husband and I plan to go there every time we go to Vegas from now on!",

The menu had many choices we all ordered something a little different and each enjoyed our entrees.  As starters we got escargot and lobster bisquit - they come to your table and make a salad to your liking.  The portions are huge!! and it comes with dessert, chocolate covered strawberries and fruit.  The coffee was a little weak but was served with wipcream, cinnamon sticks and chocolate mint sticks.

This is a old school restaurant and everything seems old about it, including the menu. Nice place to bring a girl or wife as they will hand out a rose to the ladies. Our group was all guys so no flowers for us. Everyone starts with the salad cart but I would rather have a fresh Caesar table side. I also ordered the very pricey seafood trio and was not a fan. Memo to chef, when customer pays that much money the ratio of rice to fish should not be three to one. Food was bland and needed some life. Sommelier was entertaining and it was the first time I seen a separate tip section for him on the check. Wine list was good and price for wine was reasonable. Clean up the menu and this might bring it back to the old school greatest it once had.",

You should probably make reservations, because some nights are packed. The host(ess) seeats you, grabbing roses for all the females in the bunch. The server comes and brings lavash bread and \"bottled water\". There is a wine sommelier (better be good wine), as well as a full bar. The meals come with a salad cart, stocked full of different toppings, such as anchovies, bay shrimp, bleu cheese, and an amazing peppercorn dressing. The steaks are amazing, I go for filet mignon or any small cut steak. The dessert is my favorite part, they bring you fresh whipped cream and chocolate dipped fruit. No need to order any other dessert. This meal is one of a kind, the ambience is dark and mysterious \"hence cellar\". The meal will cost ya and the bathroom is located in the casino, but it is well worth it! Trust me",

    "text": "I went there on a Saturday night recently during a boys trip to Vegas.   First of all the hostess seem perturbed when I showed up a half-hour early and told her that our reservation is minus one.  She seemed even more perturbed when I came back and said we are now up to our original number which was 7.  You think this is the first time in Vegas history that a group has shrunk because someone wanted to keep chasing their money and then thought better of it?  We still had 7 people ready to drop some cash.  Anyway, they seat us on time which is the last positive thing I'll say in this review.  After sitting down it takes around 10 minutes to order our drinks and when we ask to order wine they won't let us until the wine steward comes over.  After another 10 minutes the steward comes to our table and tells he'll be right back.  That was the last we saw of him.  By this time almost 30 minutes has expired and we haven't even ordered appetizers.  (One importnt warning to others, the pricing designation you see is not even close.  All steaks were in the $50 range with the cheapest thing on the menu being chicken for $36.)  Look I live in LA and I've dined at plenty of expensive restaurants but for these prices I expect more than a dining room in need of a serious remodel and service that  wouldn't even cut it in the islands.   The service had this forced formality that became comical after a while.  When they brought us the bread basket they acted like they were presenting us the damn Hope Diamond.  Finally, after 30 minutes of not seeing our original waiter or the wine steward we got up and left.  We politely told the hostess what happened and she seemed unconcerned.  Honestly, I was glad she didn't try to talk us into staying because it wasn't happening.   Obviously, I can't speak to the food but for the prices and level of service there are HUNDREDS of places in LV that are a lot better.  I'm sincerely glad others enjoyed it.  I get that places have bad nights but life is too short for another try.",

Let me be perfectly clear that it is in the Four Queens Hotel, a dive hotel on the old strip with the parking lot to match.  That said, when you step down the stairs into Hugo's Cellar you are in an entirely different environment.  Ladie's are greeted with a rose and the setting is very romantic (dark wood walls, candlelight).  Service is excellent and they have some great sommeliers.  They have a very good wine list and serve complementary bottled water, as well as a nice bread basket with cheese-toasted lavash and rose-shaped butter.  Their salads are the highlite, included with your meal and freshly prepared on a cart at your table.  Toppings like hearts of palm and bay shrimp and delicious dressings- try the orange walnut vinaigrette.  You are served an intermezzo sorbet to cleanse the palatte (raspberry on a mini cone).  Dinner is very traditional- chicken, fish, and steaks served with a potato and vegetable.  Not especially gourmet or cutting edge, but very old school classic and part of the experience.  They offer traditional desserts such as bananas foster prepared tableside, and they bring a complementary dessert of chocolate covered strawberries, dried figs, and apricots served with whipped cream.  This restaurant is great and remeniscent of old Vegas, definitely a must try.",

Well I am glad we did, this meal was far better, in terms of service, quality of the food and ambiance..  Hugo's is old school Vegas, way old school and that, when done correctly is not a bad thing, waiters in tuxes, salads made to order table side, classic dishes done right even a sommelier.  To start the Lobster bisque, certainly one of the better ones I have eaten lately, a good creamy taste with chunks of lobster.  A ceasers salad made table side, though the dressing is pre made, so a little bit missing there, but honestly, the only place I know that makes it from scratch now days is the Gourmet room at the Riverside in Laughlin.  For the entree, I went with the Chicken Champignon. I have to say, this dish was almost perfect. The chicken itself was perfectly cooked, the sauce was fantastic, the mushroomsoh so good, the only let down...And pretty much the only let down of the night was the potatoes....They were actually good, however thepresentation really was ...well stupid, it was clear that they came straight from a water warming pan to my plate, via an ice cream scoop,why take the time to make a great dish and then just take a scoop of potatoes and plop them on a plate...Silly.  Yes I am picking at little things, the meal really was that good.  the wife had the Sea Bass, a nice dish, though I am not a fan of Sea Bass, so we will have to take her word for it.

The staff was nice, prompt to take out drink order and definitely get your money worth when ordering a martini as you get the \"back up\" in an ice bucket.  The made to rest salad at your table was really good. My dinner was just ok, the peppercorn arrack had a sauce on it that was too thick and for sure took away from the natural flavor of the filet and the shrimp. I didn't want the asparagus that came with it and asked for a different vegetable and the waiter informed me they have nothing else other than the asparagus. That makes no sense as my husbands NY strip was served with mushrooms and my salad had onions on it. Anyway, the main course was just ok. They have a wine sommelier on staff which is extremely helpful and he was super polite. This was a nice touch and he was very honest about the in house wines.  At the end of the meal the server brings over chocolate dipped fruits and homemade whipped cream which were excellent and a nice touch.  Good place, no need to return though.",

The aged meat was FANTASTIC!  I had the filet (10oz) and it was accompanied by a couple of nice sides and included a salad prepared from their tableside cart.  This place has a great old-school vibe, not unlike the Golden Steer.  The service was truly outstanding, with someone always there to cater to our every need.

Walking off of Fremont St into the romantic, cozy cellar was like being transported do a  totally different area.  Love the idea of the rose but more importantly the service was IMPECCABLE!  I mean come on, when the sommelier has a sippy cup to try each bottle you know you re in a good spot. For once we did not over order and instead ordered the absolute perfect amount of food.  Started with the Shrimp scampi, made to order salad and then the hot rock app for two.  It was perfect- I mean the salad alone is a filler.  Two bottles of wine, the filtered Kona coffee and complimentary desserts really rounded out the meal.  What I really love is our server also agreed we ordered a great amount of food, I was nervous they would think we were being cheap but we always have tons of leftovers that we waste so thanks for being real with us! Out of the ten times I have been to Sin City I can honestly say I think Hugo's is my absolute favorite spot!  DO it, go, make the trek down to Fremont- more than worth it!",

The dinner meal (price) is all inclusive of salad, lemon sorbet palate cleanser, main dish (starch, veggies, entree), and a very light desert sampler tray of chocolate dipped strawberries, fig on white chocolate, and chocolate dipped apricots .  If you want a more heavier desert then Hugo's has a desert tray for your selection (added cost).  We had a party of 6 and a 18% gratuity was automatically added to our bill.  The service and food was excellent as commanded by the price of the meal.  The Cellar is a little dimmer than it should be.  Tables are lit by candle light to add a romantic ambiance.  Personally, I think a little more lighting is needed.  I had the prime rib 16oz cut.  There were only two choices of prime rib on the menu, 16oz & 24oz.  Frankly, there should be another choice for prime rib.  I recommend a 10 oz cut be added to the menu because the 16oz cut is too big.  I  had problems finishing the piece of meat and I'm a pretty big guy.  If you want to impress your date then this is the place to go to have a great piece of Steak or Prime Rib.",

    "text": "\"Great Old Style Vegas Experience\"  Walk down a short flight of stairs from the worn, dated 4 Queens casino, and enter another world. Instantly, you're in the restaurant frequented by celebrities of decades ago... Frank, Dean, Sammy, and others. If I have any criticism of the appearance / ambience... it is a little too dark... but, that's Old Vegas. The Maitre'D and wait staff are all in Tuxedos. Women guests are presented with a long stemmed red rose upon arrival. Service is old school, and impeccable, from sommelier, to captain, to waiter, to busboy. Salad is prepared individually tableside, intermezzo (small lemon sorbet cones), and shared dessert tray are all included with the price of the entree. Was it the best meal I ever had...NO... but maybe in the top 20%. The food is good, not great, but the overall experience is worth the visit.",

    "text": "What? A Rose for Moi? Why Thank YOU!  This place is the only good reason to step inside the 4Queens Hotel & Casino downtown. Might feel a bit sketch walking down a dark hall into the \"cellar\" but as quickly as you reach the floor from the last step, you are greeted with great smiles and a rose for the females. Make sure you make a reservation before coming in, or you may end up waiting a bit. Luckily, while waiting, you can enjoy yourself to some tasty beverages! The bartender is this cocky but not annoying and sarcastic guy with all the right words and moves to keep you entertained. Once you are seated in, you can definitely tell this is a higher class dinning event. The menu is packed with such good delights! Extremely pricey, but money is no object when you bite into their delicious dishes.   One thing that sets this place apart from all the rest is the amount of servers that will be in your service. You have your water guy, then a mixed drink/beverage guy or John the wine guy, who really knows his stuf, and then you have a salad/dessert guy and then your main wait person. If you tell John what kind of wine you enjoy, he will suggest the finest wines for you to taste, which he also wears this cup thing around his neck to taste the wine before he serves it to you to try. These are definitely not your average cheap wine that you can easily buy at the store either.   The salad is prepped and made right in front of you with lots of options as to what you wanted in it. After is the hot tasty meal, which never fails to disappoint! I had one of the more popular lobster dish called the Queens Lobster, that apparently is the favorite of the staffs. It was amazing! The portion was too big for me to finish so I had boxed some to eat the next day and it was just as tasty the next day as it was fresh the day before. For desserts you have an option to pick from the menu and from the cart of delectable goodies. I don't remember the name of the desserts we had but I do remember having a show for it. It was some sort of sundae that was flamed and roasted in front of us. It was spectacular!  After dinner, you can walk around Freemont and watch the experience. This year, they had a zip line going down from a tall building down the street all the way to the 4queens. It's another way to get the full Freemont experience after being pampered at Hugo's.  Oh and make sure you are dressed to impress when you walk into Hugo's Cellar. This is not a casual attire type of place. Hugo's is definitely a MUST when visiting Vegas! I can't wait to go back next year!",

The instant you walk down the steps the atmosphere and ambiance changes to elegance and peacefulness. The amazing service starts with the hostess and continues all the way through the end of the meal. The waiter and his team are extremely attentive to everything that's happening at your table. The rose that you get is pretty much a perfect rose, long stemmed, bloomed, flawless color, and smells great.   The dishes are a bit pricey but I want to say they give you a story along with the food. Everything that comes out is perfectly timed during the course of your meal and is done to enhance the food. I would say this place gives you more than a meal, you also get an uniquely memorable experience.  The banana's fosters was so good! and they make it fresh in front of you. I would recommend saving room for this! I had the beef wellington, even though it's my second time having it, it was pretty amazing. I ordered a straight up Caesar's salad, I don't know what it was...but I couldn't stop eating it even though I got a little extra. Maybe it was the freshness of everything, the dressing, or the crispy croutons I just couldn't stop eating it. For appetizers, we had crab cakes and the hot rocks. You can taste the freshness in the crab cakes from the first bite and gets even better with the sauce. If you happen to go into Hugo's after someone orders the hot rocks, you'll want to order it too. It smells delicious and it fills up the whole  restaurant. It's perfect for a date and adds to that experience.",

    "text": "I was walking along Fremont when I saw this place on yelp.  I came downstairs after grabbing a pint upstairs at the Chicago Brewing, I wasn't acknowledged by Richard right away, a couple that came in after me was seated first (I'll dismiss this because they likely had reservations and I did not).  The server Jean(Gene?) and his assistant and the food was top notch and attentive the whole evening.  my main issue is with the manager and host - Richard, who is a pompous bigot. I encourage if anyone has any issues with Richard to report it to the hotel management, I wouldn't be surprised if your skin is dark or if you're not as well dressed that he will tell you the tables are full from reservations or treat you similarly.  There are no restrooms in the restaurant, so you need to go out and to the casino floor, Jeans assistant gave me brief and accurate directions and I returned to find a fine glass of Moscato waiting for me which I ordered to pair with the escargot, which I might add was the best I had since Paris.  The salad was custom crafted and the rack of lamb was cooked exactly as requested  I tried to go to the bathroom a second time after getting my lamb, and then Richard blocked my way, he insisted that I must leave a credit card before leaving, even though I left and returned before, as well as I had left personal items, including my phone, in plain site on the table.  It was clear that Richard was profiling me because he thought I was of lesser class.   I am absolutely insulted.  I gave my card frustratingly and returned to finish my meal, the hostess that seated me originally apologized for Richards behavior and ignorance, I asked Jean if Richard had a manager I could speak with but was told unfortunately that he was the manager and I had no point of escalation. Jean also apologized for Richards behavior, it seems I'm not the only one he mistreats.  I finished my meal, and I thought I would go to the floor quick and drop $5 in the slots while I let my dinner settle as my phone battery was low and I was catching a redeye out that evening, since I had plenty to drink already I brought my water, again leaving personal items on the table.  Richard again blocked me this time and insisted I must leave the glass, not asking where I was going or if I'd return, I felt like dumping the water on his head but unfortunately couldn't without possibly getting a customer wet.  When I returned, my table was cleared, obviously they don't want me eating their wonderful selection of dessert, and Richard had Jean's assistant clear my table, he apologized for this and I could feel it was sincere, I never received a single apology from Richard, hence the label pompous bigot.",

I do not understand where these good reviews are coming from -disappointing.  I work at an upscale steakhouse on the strip and this place is a joke.  The servers are rude and short - maybe working at the same place for 30 years made them bitter.  We ordered a bottle of wine and almost finished it when our appetizer showed up almost an hour later.  The food is subpar and for their prices one can get superior food and service on the strip for less.  This was my fiance' birthday and if we didn't have fun laughing at the experience we would have had a terrible time.  Worst than the food was the terrible service.  We will NEVER go back.",

I had the rib-eye and my friend got the filet with foie gras. First, my rib-eye was not medium rare - it was rare- and so I had to send it back. To me that was disappointing for the chef (or helper) to not get it right.  And the flavor was just alright. Oh they serve salad before hand and it was just alright.  I wasn't impressed.  They make it right in front of you which had its appeal.  The garnish was unimpressive.  The veggies were slightly overcooked.    My friend's foie gras were so small that it's like getting a thin slice of meat at the deli counter.  It wasn't worth what they were charging.  And because the piece was so small the flavor didn't stick out.    Honestly, I wouldn't go back.  I've had better steaks in LA and I bet I could get better elsewhere in Vegas.  Spend your money on the bigger restaurants like Bobby Flay or something.    The service to me was just ok. It took a long while for us to get service and greeted.  That was problematic for me.    So all in all, for experience sake, sure go here. But for really good food for the money that you will end up spending there anyway, go elsewhere.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to dining here... If there is one thing I truly don't mind splurging on it is good quality dining. To begin, I loved my long stem rose, traditionally classy. Nice touch. Problem#1: I was looking forward to a glass of wine to find they only have house wines available in glasses. All others are bottle only. That is a bit inconvenient for me, since my bf doesn't drink wine and a bottle would absolutely have me in ruins if I were brave enough to try to drink it alone. But ok, not a huge deal. Problem #2: My bf ordered 12yr or 18yr Jameson whichever they had available. A few moments later he came back with a glass of whiskey on the rocks, and informed us that they only had regular Jameson so that's what he brought out. Yuck. This set the mood for a bit of a disappointment right out of the gate...  We ordered our meals and continued our evening festivities without further awkward moments but when the food came out I was left a bit disappointed again. Problem #3: I ordered the rack of lamb, which was actually really tough and not even the slightest tender at all. My bf ordered a steak and after trying a bite it was ok, but not nearly the quality of cut I would expect from such a renowned steak house. The rest of the night was fine. Great service and later the server explained to us that the mix up with the whiskey was that he was not very knowledgeable about the difference between the whiskeys and had been given the drink to serve by the bartender so he simply went with it. Which is understandable. I paid the bill, tipped accordingly regardless and called it a night. The experience was superb as far as service was concerned but the food was more like quality I would expect from somewhere very generic. I've tasted better food at BJ's for 1/4 of the bill. We have been to Joe Vicari's Andiamo at The D casino just around the corner from here and it was by far a better steakhouse by a long shot! Downtown in general has some amazing dining but this place definitely fell short of the list of favorites. Doubt I'll ever be back.",

Let me just say we had not said anything about the noise before they moved us. The servers and staff were amazing, the table side salad was fantastic. My main issue was the main courses, I ordered Australian lobster tail, and filet mignon. The filet was warm and nothing to rave about nothing special. The lobster tails were warm and rubbery. Not impressed with main courses at all. I don't know if the chef was having a bad day or what. At the prices charged I expected much more and years ago they did provide.

Larger than life steaks, prime rib and seafood served with wonderful sides like white/green asparagus and parsley potatoes. The salad cart is a treat as you choose your way through topping such as artichokes, tomatoes and house-made dressings. To top off your meal they deliver chocolate dipped strawberries and other tasty treats. The service is top notch and formal but not stuffy. They even start the meal for the ladies with a rose.",

No, what you get here is class, service, and a wonderful atmosphere.  A place that will whisk you away and for a moment you won't feel like you're in Vegas.  Their set course meal is the most reasonable.  Table side tossed salad, their signature prime rib and a dessert tray as well.    I do recommend getting their banana foster. It will melt in your mouth and leave you wanting more!",

My boyfriend and I were celebrating both our birthdays...we both ordered the Rib Eye steak with garlic mashed potatoes and having our salad made table side was GREAT!  I have to be honest and say we BOTH thought we had the BEST steak EVER!

For an \"old school gourmet restaurant in a romantic atmosphere\" why is there NO dress code?! I don't want to sit next to a party of college kids in shorts and tank tops! All the elderly people understand this is a place you dress up for. Secondly, this restaurant seriously needs to move away from downtown. Four Queens is a trashy gaudy casino in the ghetto of Vegas. When the elevator clunks and jerks when it moves the three people it will fit, and there are people wearing gang colors just hanging out in a group looking at all the cars park, it kind of makes you say, \"I don't care how good the food is if I think my car might get broken in to.\" If this place moved to a nicer neighborhood, and maybe had an upstairs/downstairs to separate the average tourist from someone actually having a \"night out\" like an anniversary, then I would recommend this place, but not as it is now. There are too many great restaurants to have to travel all the way downtown.",

Waiter (Michael) was good, we were seated promptly (party of 10); food/ambiance/bar does not compare anymore to other leading steakhouses (Flemings, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, etc.).  The wine 'sommelier' is an A-HOLE!  We asked about a bottle of Les Dix Cab, he said it was very good,  blah, blah, blah...we ordered two bottles - he came back with 'the only one we have left'...I know my wines and this was clearly undrinkable...I let others taste it at our table and they agreed.  When I asked if he tasted it (with his tasting cup hanging around his neck) - he said he did.  Trust me, I watched him open the bottle, pour my tasting...he never tasted the stuff.  It was awful - this last bottle must have been stored in the alley.  He turned into a real prick in a hurry....first of all don't lie to me, and secondly don't treat the customer like dirt.  He took it back, brought out another 'recommendation' (Whitehall Lane Cab - it was better, but not great).  He poured it and never ever came back to our table - a real, walking, talking A-Hole.  Funny thing was, when the bill arrived we did not get the detailed breakdown - I swear to God I was charged for the bad bottle of Les Dix, but we were celebrating my wife's birthday and my daughter's engagement and I was not going to raise a stink.  They had the balls to put areas on the bill for tips for the Wine Steward and Waiter after already adding 18% for our group - no problem with 18% for a group of 10, but I put a big fat ZERO in for any other tips just because that Wine Steward was such a JACKASS!  Salad cart is not what it used to be and is over-rated!  You can spend the same elsewhere and have a much better experience.  No space in the bar for a comfortable pre-dinner cocktail.  Hugo's is officially in the cellar for me and I cannot recommend it.  Food was not as good as Flemings.",

Dimmly lit but cheery with chatter, this is the old time \"romantic\" restaurant.   Our booth had a little frosted flower light fixture mounted on the wall low, next to the table. Etched glass separated the booths to provide a little sound privacy. All the women received a long stem rose just before you're seated and the service was attentive from beginning to end.  There's a lot of gray hair in this place but it's a totally sweet place that doesn't smell old. Sure there's fake plants and Christmas lights. Sure the chandeliers feel a little like a billiards hall... but it's a really cute place.  The food was decent. My prime rib was cooked rare as I requested but I found the meat to be a bit too chewy. The Beef Wellington melted in my mouth though and I'd order it again.  I love that a great salad, bottled water and chocolate dipped strawberries all come to complete your meal. You'll even get a little cone of sherbet between your salad and entree.   Foodwise this place is fair. But when you consider the service and the atmosphere this place is a solid 4 out of 5 stars.",

The steaks are great (and reasonably priced, considering), but its the service that really shines here. Order a martini, and they will bring the drink cart to your table and make one as big as your head right there.

    "text": "While visiting friends who live in North Las Vegas, they took us Downtown to a steakhouse none of us had tried. We were going by reviews on Yelp and on the advice of their son. All the times I've been to Vegas, I would have never considered dinner Downtown, but I was game. We called ahead to find out if we could bring wine, and as long as it wasn't on their list, the corkage was only $10. Walking in to the Four Queens is like going back in time to the days of Old Las Vegas. The smoke filled casino was crowded with cowboys in town for the Rodeo, so all the employees were dressed in western gear.  That is until we walked down the stairs into Hugo's Cellar. Talk about Old School Steakhouses. All the waiters were dressed in tuxedos and the dark space was reminiscent of days gone by.  The minute we walked in the room we were greeted by the hostess who handed me and my girlfriend a red rose. Our husbands were already impressed. When we sat at our corner table, they provided us with a vase for our flowers so they stayed fresh. The waiters were all very helpful, friendly and well informed, and the sommelier certainly knew his wines. Surprisingly one of the obsure bottles we brought with us was on their list, so we chose not to pay the exhorbitant corkage for that one. To say their wine list was impressive would be an understatement.  We all ordered steaks, which came with the salad cart and sides. Everything was absolutely delicious. The 3\" thick filet mignon was almost tender enough to cut with a fork.  I chose the gorgonzola sauce to go on top, but to be honest the steak didn't need anything to make it better. My suggestion is to skip the sauces and dig right into the prime beef.  We skipped dessert, although their list looked great. However we got chocolate covered strawberries as our final course, which were very tasty.  All in all we really enjoyed Hugo's Cellar and would definitely recommend it to anyone taking the time to head Downtown instead of staying on The Strip.",

    "text": "This was our first time to Hugo's.  We have had family recommend Hugo's telling us it was great food and great service. We were in Vegas to celebrate a 30th birthday and had a large party, about 22 people. We were told they would be able to accommodate the party in a large back room but when we arrived we were told the party would be at three different tables. After we had complained they were able to get us down to two tables. Once we were seated they came around quickly and took our drink order. My wife and I had heard about the portions so we had decided to share. We got the lobster bisque and the seafood trio. The waiter serving the salads was very friendly and was able to make everyone smile. The issue with the salads was even though we were seated at two tables only one person was making the salads. It ended up taking close to 40 minutes before everyone had their salad. Our biggest issue was with our main order. We are not sure if it was because of the large party and having to get the food out at one time but it was not anywhere close to the quality we would expect from a restaurant of this type. The lobster bisque was closer to a squash bisque so much to the point that we could not taste the lobster that was in the bisque. The seafood trio was also a disappointment. We have had seabass on many different occasions and love it due to the fact that the fish is very easy to cook and has a great flavor. This time the seabass did not have it's normal taste and instead had an odd flavor that was almost like it was cooked in an unclean pan. The crab cake also was a let down. I believe that it was made with nutmeg as it tasted closer to a pumpkin pie than a crab cake. All said we did not even come close to having half of the meal. Keep in mind my wife and I were sharing the meal! I could have looked passed the quality of the food , and chalked it up to the large party, but what happened when we mentioned the food tasting off and that it had upset our stomachs is the reason we will never go back and the reason I suggest you do not visit Hugo's. Instead of saying sorry, instead of checking the food, instead of asking if we were alright we were asked to talk to security.  In addition this was not done at security but instead beside our table.  This included giving a written statement and having our photo taken! I understand that the restaurant needs to make sure they are covered incase something serious happens due to the food. I also understand that people try to get out of checks all the time in a place like Vegas. However, I do not see the point of having a security guard come down to a table, in front of all their other customers, to get a statement about the food and how you have stomach pains due to it. In the end we paid over 90 dollars for sub par food that was not even half eaten. If you are considering going to Hugo's I suggest the steak, otherwise you are better off getting a hotdog from a street vendor. Less chance of getting sick and it will taste like you would expect a hotdog to taste.",

The hub and I are big fans of this old-school gourmet room, where a couple can get some hooch with their dinner and still have a bill slightly over $100. It's dark and cozy, and the roses to the ladies add a cheesy yet sweet touch. Food isn't trendy or exotic, but is solid. I usually splurge on the filet with a bowl of lobster bisque. The salad cart service comes with the meal, and is always a treat. I look forward to the complimentary dessert tray with chocolate dipped fruit. And every time I have been there, the sommelier wears this Flavor Flav-esque clock/necklace thing. I have no idea what its purpose is, but it slays me!

They were telling us that Hugo's has been there for like 20 years, and in that time the only \"advertising\" they've done is start a web-page.  It's all word-of-mouth and repeat business; take our word for it - if you're in Vegas make the trip out to the 4 Queens and you won't be disappointed.",

Now as an old Married women (yes this place has been here this long) I am still so amazed of the experiance of this meal. I can still hear my Dad say there is eating and there is dining and this is dining! I also love that like all the other top resturaunts have were you by your entree but if you want a salad and a side you have to pay extra for both. Not here you pay for your entree and you get the salad cart, the palate cleansing sherbert , your entree and side and then even chocolate dip fruit. It is the best deal in Vegas!",

I had the fillet and while it was big it wasn't one of the best fillets I've ever had. It just lacked a bit of character. There was no wow factor I guess.  The mashed potato's are the best I've ever had. They could be radioactive and I would still eat them by the truckload.  My wife had the veal and it was a edible, but nothing she would order again.  The salads are cool, the service great, and the wine list was stout. If your downtown check it out, but I'm not sure I would take the $20 cab ride to and from from the strip just to eat here.",

They prepare the salad for you right at your table. I remember the service being really great, top-notch. The food was delicious. We aslo sat next to a table of famous poker players which was kind of funny, too.   It's definitely a nice place and probably a great place to go for a special ocassion dinner. It isn't that expensive but I wouldn't say it was cheap either.",

This is an ideal place to take your special lady (or guy) for a special meal. Ironically, my first meal there was with three other guys, but I immediately brought my wife there the next time we were in Vegas.  Hugo's gives you a throwback feel to the classy full service fine dining from days of yore. The sommalier was very helpful and the table side salads were a real treat. My favorite entree was the beef wellington.  Plan on spending some coin, but just sit back and soak everything in. You don't find many places like Hugo's Cellar any more.",

The ambiance was great the service was outstanding.  Each lady received a long stem rose (which lasted for almost a week.)  The presentation for my martini was perfect.  (It was really a double for only $12).  The second part of the drink was in it's own carafe and in an ice bucket.  The table side salad service was very nice.  The fact that the entrees come with matching sides is appreciated.    My actual rating for this restaurant would be 4.5 stars.  That is because the particular entrees that we had (I had the duck--she had the New York) were only good (not WOW).  However, the overall experience was so positive, that we will be back next time we're in Vegas and will try other dishes.",

Main courses -- Those who got Prine Rib absolutely loved it, and based on the bites I stole, I agree. Stupidly I got the seafood trio, and I will comment on each item. The crab cake had a lot of filler and was very average. The Chilean Sea Bass was begging for a Miso glaze. The shrimp was over-cooked and rubbery. My bad for ordering seafood in a steak place. Just go ahead and get meat!!  Loved the old school vegas vibe, and seeing downtown. Go here when you have time to explore Freemont Street--super fun!! Definitely go here!

My Husband ordered a steak medium & it was served very rare. They offered to \"re-heat\" it. Ummm, no. I ordered an end cut of prime rib & was served a large slice of crusty charcoal. I ordered it medium well, no pink. I tried to send it back & the waiter said all their end cuts are well-done. OK, fair enough,  but say that when I ask for medium well. They took my dinner off the bill but charged my Husband $61 for a steak he sent back. Ummm, wha??? No. Waiter would not take it off the bill so we asked politely to speak to the manager. The manager came over & told us his waiter said we 'were okay with it'. OK with paying $61 for a steak he sent back?  Hmmmmm. He had ONE BITE & found out how rare it was. It was not a case of eating most of a meal & then sending it back. Nope. The food was improperly prepared. Don't take your chances with having to argue about a bill. Go to the Charcoal Room & have a nice steak. Not on the strip but well worth the drive. No drama, just good steak",

Then they will all lead your party to your table.  They offer you bread and offer you the wine list/drink list right off the bat. Last year our awesome waiter assigned us drinks based on our personalities. We enjoyed them!  My favorite part of the meal besides the amazing steaks (rib eye, NY steak and prime rib, are all recommended) and the yummy sides, is the salad.

This came with the following: salad, sorbet, meat with all the sides, and dessert.    The handsome salad man, who tosses salad all night long, will come over to the table and make you the perfect salad with whatever you want on your personal salad.  First chose you dressing and then you can add whatever you want.    After the salad you will be served sorbet which will cleanse your pallet for your main course.  When our filet came out, it looked so delicious.  The filet was served with garlic whipped mashed potatoes, green and white asparagus, and bearnaise sauce.  The steak was succulent and devine. It was cooked just how I like it.  I will definitely be coming back.    This is great place for anniversaries, Valentine 's Day, or any date or event.",

I understand it was a later reservation at 830 but still I don't think we should have been made to feel like we were annoying them or a burden. They forgot to bring a few things to our table , they gave my father in law my medium rare and gave me his medium, and the food wasn't even that hot , like it had been under a food lamp.   For the price I think I will go somewhere else . I really was so excited to have my bday dinner here too.  The desserts were great I will say that!  You know it really wasn't the food so much as that was enjoyable ...it really boiled down to the service.

    "text": "So today's adventure found us headed to Vegas and looking for a good spot for dinner. Leave it to our VP Jeff who lived in Vegas for many years suggesting a very nostalgic spot known as Hugos Cellar in the Four Queens.  He was looking for a place that still maintained a Rat Pack feel to it and we definitely found that at Hugo's this evening.  The restaurant truly is located in the cellar of the Four Queens and the second you descend the stairs into Hugo's reception area, it feels like you're walking into a set of a very dark and broody dinner scene of a Coppola movie.  They do give the ladies in your party roses and I'm not quite sure if that makes it romantic or just a little creepy, which isn't so bad either--if you're into creepy. :)  We had reservations for 9pm, arrived a few minutes early and were seated without waiting at all.  Host and servers were very friendly and seemed to be on their games--especially Michael, our salad and dessert chef.  Unfortunately, although coming across as very professional, our waiter on the other hand, was very slow and not very attentive.  Drinks took forever and it was another HOUR before we were even asked for the next round.  Appetizers were delicious but so slow to get to the table.  We even had to ask to put our orders in because we were never prompted to in that first hour.  Our entrees didn't arrive until almost 1 hour and 25 minutes later 5 minutes before they closed.  We had an upset table to say the least.  Once our dinners arrived, the mood began to lighten because of the quality and presentation of every dish.  My NY steak was done PERFECTLY medium and was incredibly tender and perfectly seasoned.  I ordered it with the au poivre sauce that needed just a smidgen of salt but after that was pure heaven.   I went with the red potatoes and steamed vegetables as my sides and they came out still retaining their crispness and wonderfully moist.    After that meal you have no idea how much it pains me to give it three stars but the waiting was handled so miserably that I just have to deduct two stars for it.    Hugo, please read this and make these errors right in the future.  I would love to give you another try, but unless there's some assurance it's been addressed, I'm back to the strip to my regular steak places.....",

    "text": "An intimate romantic restaurant with excellent high quality dining! This is one of the best restaurants to dine at here in Las Vegas. Tucked away inside of the Four Queens casino, you go down the stairs into a lowly lit beautiful dining experience. It starts with a staff member handing the women in your party a fresh rose. You are greeted by multiple staff, it is a very warm and friendly environment. Plan on spending some time when you come here, your dinner is served in stages and it is well worth the wait. They have an excellent menu of fine dining, from steaks to fish. I love the experience of the table side salad preparation. You can choose from a large array of additions from anchovies, pinenuts, boiled eggs and artichoke hearts. If you would like to have wine, the sommelier will come and discuss it with you, and give you recommendations. Also know that they do have half bottles of wine if you just want a glass or two. I had the fillet wrapped in bacon topped with crabmeat.  The steak was very tender, even though I ordered it well done! They offer a complimentary dessert tray, with fresh fruit dipped in chocolate. This restaurant is an excellent choice for a fine dining experience and a great date night!",

    "text": "What in the blue hell are you thinking my fellow food critics ?!!!! If Hugo's is a 4.5 star steakhouse than you may as well throw me in the kennel and lock up the key because this has got to be the most overrated and overpriced restaurant in las Vegas. I spent weeks deciding on where to eat to celebrate my cousin's engagement. after much deliberation I settled on Hugo's because everyone recommended the place from our hotel concierge  to the Yelp community. Well I should have known when the restaurant  asked me for my credit card number upon making a reservation that this was going to totally suck. Should have listened to my instincts....  We started with the mixed meat grill which consisted of a bunch of undercooked meats that they bring out on a sizzling platter. Nothing was seasoned at all so the meat itself tasted bland and dull. Plus the chicken was undercooked when they brought it out so we had to kind of guess when it was ready to eat. The various dipping sauces that came out with the platter were just entirely overpowering and the dish itself was just a pointless and lazy way to serve meats at a high end restaurant like Hugo's. Since we were a party of 7 people it was at this point that I began to worry that the rest of the meal would go downhill. Once again I was right...   The table side salad was a complete f^*%%ing joke. I'm angry just typing this out. It's like the salad bar they used to have at sizzlers except a waiter is actually mixing ingredients into your custom salad. The ingredients were cheap and pathetic. My shrimp were smaller than toe nail clippings. The lettuce was wilted and The salad itself wasn't even tossed well AT ALL. I basically had a glob of dressing that never made its way onto any of the lettuce.  Everyone hated their salad. Nuff said...  Next We proceed to the entrees and nothing improves. I ordered the tenderloin and shrimp both of which were drowning in a cream sauce. The shrimp themselves were actually cooked well. They were also deveined. My steak was small and bland once again. Albeit there was no fat which I will say was nice. The veggies on the plate were a complete afterthought and the mashed potatoes tasted like Ora Ida box mix. I was too embarrassed to ask how everyone else's meal was but judging by the half eaten plates i don't think a single person enjoyed their meal here. The assorted chocolate covered fruits at the end were a nice gesture but unfortunately they did not make up for the lackluster meal our party was served that evening.   I love old school steakhouses but only if it's done right. This was not done right. The fact that we were the last table in there on a Saturday night at 10pm was probably a bad sign. Oh and the fire alarm went off twice during our meal. The staff never came over to apologize so we basically sat at our table and listened to that loud noise for a good 15 minutes. It was probably a sign from God that i made a fatal mistake by eating here.   Never again.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas to celebrate two birthdays and were sad to hear that our usual birthday stop was not open for the season.  So the steak lover in our group made reservations for Hugo's.  My daughter, who is such a romantic though she doesn't realize it, fell in love with Hugo's the minute they presented all the women in our group with a rose.  Then, she was in heaven when on the menu was the caesar salad (her favorite salad) prepared \"table-side\", somewhat of a dying art where we live, as far as I know.    This is an old-fashioned (in a good sense) steakhouse that is so elegant, yet not stuffy thanks to the friendly staff and a knowledgeable sommelier with a great sense of humor.  They have your standard steak selections that you expect from great steakhouses, in addition to delicious fish, chicken, duck, and lamb choices.  Their rack of lamb is served with an Indonesian sauce . . . . But not to worry, they also can serve it with mint jelly!  Phew!  Their beef wellington is delicious (tasted my husband's).  To top off the dining experience, we were presented with a splendid platter of chocolate dipped fruit.   Now we have two favorite steakhouses that we need to visit when we are in Vegas!    The only thing that I missed was that crust that some places have on their steaks. Oh, and for \"old eyes\" you may need to use your phone's light to read the menu because it is a little dark--can't give up the ambience just to accommodate us old people.",

    "text": "First of all, being a local, I frequent this restaurant often and it has been our MOST recommended restaurant in Vegas for our out-of-town friends for many years.  We have always recommended it for many reasons: every woman receives a rose upon entering the establishment; classic Vegas ambiance; its great bang-for-your-buck menu where entrees include bottled water, table-side salad service, and chocolate-dipped fruits for dessert.    The sommelier, Jon, is one of my favorite things about Hugo's.  Jon is quite witty and makes excellent recommendations for wine.    The sea bass and prime rib are both excellent choices for entrees.  The bananas foster is a must-have dessert served flaming table-side.  My primary reason for the 3-star review is for the following reason:  We received our bill at the end of a fabulous dinner for six (we took two couples who had never been).  The bill only listed a total price and two lines for tips (one for the waiter and one for sommelier).  We asked for an itemized bill so we knew what we spent in wine to determine the tips for each.  When they brought the itemized bill, we realized it had ALREADY INCLUDED an 18% gratuity!! So, they were trying to get a DOUBLE-TIP!!  This was VERY EMBARRASSING for us at the end of such an amazing evening and such a let-down after so many loyal years coming to Hugo's.",

    "text": "I'll begin by saying that Hugo's used to be one of my favorite places for dinner in Las Vegas. I came here many times with friends and relatives of friends in years past. Always top-notch.  We came through Las Vegas on a trip to Zion recently and stayed overnight but couldn't get a dinner reservation at Hugo's. Instead, on recommendation of the reservationist, we had dinner at Top of Binions Steak House which we found to be excellent and above our expectations!    But, on our way back through LV, we made reservations at Hugo's since I had been raving about it for awhile. My BF had not eaten at either place before. He is what I would consider a foodie and a wine connoisseur (not snobby, but very good) and has been to many fine, including Michelin rated restaurants. He likes to discuss wine with the sommeliers, I usually just drink what he orders. Lol.   Anyway, I'm sad to say, Hugo's has lost its way. I'm not sure what has happened but our service was not up to the standards I had experienced in the past. We ordered drinks before dinner but expected our waiter to ask us if we planned to also have wine with dinner. I told my BF that they have a really good sommelier so he'd probably be coming by our table. Well, I was wrong, it didn't happen. Maybe there is no sommelier anymore but our waiter rarely checked on us so we couldn't ask. My BF ordered a 16 oz New York steak with au gratin potatoes with a side dish of spinach. I had the ala carte salad and was going to try a bite of his steak, potatoes and eat half the spinach. He ordered the steak Med-rare as usual. He told me that he can tell the quality of a good steak by the texture and how tender it is when cooked not more than medium rare. Well, I saw him discreetly discard several bites due to how tough the steak was. I kept telling him to inform the waiter, BUT NO waiter came to ask!! In fact, a different waiter brought our food out and we didn't even see our regular waiter until much later...too late to order something else and too late for wine!! YIKES! He left a lot of the steak on the plate... I will say that the au gratin potatoes were delicious albeit a bit salty...I ate more than a bite of those.  Honestly, I don't think we'll be back just for the salad and potatoes.",

The service was top notch.  From beginning to end we were taken care of. We ordered an escargot appetizer. It was amazing. Buttery, not too much garlic, a must try if you haven't tried it before.  We got a filet with shrimp and a lobster appetizer as a meal. The filet came with a salad and I added one to the lobster. The salad add on was $21, it was good but not worth the extra money. They make it table side and there are quite a few toppings to chose from. The filet however was not good at all. I was so surprised by the dish in general. The potatoes, veggies and steak looked like something you would get at Outback. The filet had no flavor whatsoever. Fleming's has a way better filet. The lobster appetizer was good but really heavy as it had a thick sauce it was in. Overall the environment and service was great, but I don't plan on coming back especially if I plan on ordering a steak.",

    "text": "One of the last of the Old Vegas steakhouses, this gem in the basement of 4 Queens Casino on Fremont is fantastic. The service from the tuxedoed waiters is top notch and the food is great. All this is in a fun classic old school Vegas setting.  The steaks are good but my favorite was actually the included salad made table-side on a wheeled cart that has probably been used for many decades. Each person at the table is asked what dressing they would like and then multiple salad ingredients are offered one-by-one until you have the salad perfect for you.  Also, a cake plate of desserts is brought to the table (also included with your meal). This included chocolate-covered strawberries, figs and apricots (one per person). Don't miss out on this dying breed of a restaurant.",

    "text": "Over the weekend, we celebrated with my niece who recently passed Nevada's Registered Nurse licensing exam. Our dinner celebration at Hugo's Cellar was excellent.   Upon arrival, our niece was presented a red rose (nice touch for the Lady). The space in the lower level of the Four Queens felt like an elegant, tucked away, hidden cavern.  If you like the classic mid-century steakhouse & martini ambiance, this is the place to be.   Highlights:   ** The tossed Caesar salad table side is awesome. Whole anchovies available on your salad (yum).  ** We all enjoyed our meal. If you like seafood, the seabass is prepared to perfection. A nice delicate fish filet. I opted for the wild rice as my side dish. The wild rice is seasoned very well. My dining companions enjoyed their steaks. ** In about the mid -point of your dining experience, a small scoop of gelato on a cone is offered to refresh your palate (great touch). **The dessert, prepared table side, is quite spectacular. We called up the cherries jubilee. The flambeed dessert is not only sublime, its preparation is fun to watch.  **Most importantly, kudos to the staff who helped create a very special evening for the niece. Thanks to Rashard, David, the rest of table staff, the friendly host & hostess who greeted us at the entrance, and our sommelier (sorry, I did not get the sommelier's first name).  **The wine selection is impressive. Our sommelier recommended a spectacular Bordeaux. We had two bottles.  **Long stem red rose for the Lady.  We will definitely return to this gem.  Overall, an elegant, casual, and enjoyable five star dining experience.",

    "text": "Short review: This place is very expensive (for Las Vegas) for mediocre food. You can do much better, even in Fremont St. as the food is mostly flavorless  Longer review: the salad \"cart\" has some weird choices and they drown your salad in dressing and don't really ask how much of each ingredient you want. The steaks are black angus and not USDA Prime however, you pay Prime prices. Everyone at the table ordered the prime rib cooked medium and they all came out in varying degrees of \"doneness.\" The steak itself was tender but had absolutely no seasoning or flavor and no crust or rub on the cap. They relied on the au jus and the potent horseradish for their flavor. the \"pomme puree\" you get is just a standard order of cold mashed potatoes and nothing special. The roasted fingerling potatoes are essentially whole baked potatoes but with a bit of salt on the outside. Overall, the entrees were very disappointing for the price.  The atmosphere was vintage Vegas and they gave all the ladies a rose when we arrived and the waiters are very friendly and wear tuxedos. Nothing bad about the service but the food is the biggest factor and it was a huge miss.  Hu-go somewhere else in my opinion. If I had to guess, it's the same Prime Rib they're serving at Magnolia's upstairs for $15.",

    "text": "\"Hey, Hugo, the Late Seventies called and they want their awesomeness back!\" Deep in the bowels of the Four Queens, just past an octogenarian with thick horn-rimmed glasses and perched firmly yet precarious upon a red (they're always red) scooter you will find the stairs that descend into the time warp that is Hugo's Cellar. And, I hope you understand that I mean this in the very best sense.  The menu, the courses, the table-side service are all stolen from the late seventies/early eighties, and in what could have been a cheap knock off, instead becomes a loving homage to the best of that time. From the Sommelier, to the very attentive staff (some of my party thought them perhaps overly attentive), I felt like we were in very good hands. Some of the fare that stood out as of a mistakenly maligned era, are the beef wellington, the glazed duck breast, and the ecargot en croute. The table side prepared salad (and for others I saw in the restaurant, the bananas foster and the cherries jubilee) add some entertainment as well.  Most in my party got the steaks, which they enjoyed. I chose the maple glazed duck, which was delicious.  What was also nice, and what felt like added value to the experience were the sorbet that they offered after the salad course (Caesar made to order table-side) as a palate cleanser and the strawberries and dried figs and apricots in chocolate as a dessert, that we had in lieu of a proper dessert.   If you feel like you may have missed something by having never dined at a fine restaurant in 1979, then do yourself a favor and try it. Hugo reminded me that there was a lot of charm back then, and what may have fallen out of favor, or became cliched in the ever-changing food scene still has a lot to offer us.   It is expensive, which is not what I expected from a restaurant nestled in a casino that still has $5 blackjack tables (another throwback to a bygone time), but then again, Oscar's Restaurant sits perched above a MacDonald's one floor below, which I have also been to, and which I will remember forever, but for a very different reason.",

The staff was polite and welcoming. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the wine menu and the menu itself. He made excellent suggestions for wine. I ordered the filet. It was cooked to perfection. It was under seasoned but the bearnaise sauce made up for it in a hurry. Every woman gets a single red rose adding to the ambiance.  I think, as far as steak restaurants in Vegas, this place offers the same quality as places on the strip at a way better price point.",

    "text": "My husband has been wanting to come here for valentines dinner for 5 years, and he finally made the reservation 3 month in advance. So I canceled mine at Capital grill.  We were so excited to dine in the \"most romantic place\". But I was such a disappointment.  It was a dungeon, minimal lighting, old fashioned framed pictures filled every red brick wall. The decors looks so old. Other customers were all in their seniors age, loud, but seems happy.   So for appetizer we ordered the Seafood on ice for two. Crab and lobster was over cooked, flavorless and chewy, and the best thing on the plate was their shrimp, big, crunchy and fresh.    For dinner, his rib eye was tasteless, no salt whatsoever, after we informed the server, he said we had pour the sauce on it. My sea bass was pan seared with lemon butter sauce, the fish was so dry, portion was tiny, that it stuck in my teeth every time I take a bite. Feels like eating short hair or lemon butter dental floss. The black rice was flavorful. Veggie were soggy and old, definitely not cooked to order. And table side salad below par, I rather California chicken salad in LA, which only cost a fraction.  Oh I highly recommend their sorbet(free) to cleanse your palette after salad. I almost asked my server for second one.   Overall, won't come back. If you want excellent dry aged steak, capital grill at fashion show mall, romantic, especially if you get a window seat. I wish I kept my original reservation. Their steak need no sauce to swallow. And their fish didn't taste like strings. Not sure where they purchased their sea bass, I have had Naked Fish's black cod, it was so buttery and silky, it melts in your mouth. They should send their chief to those restaurants to learn how to cook steak and seafood.  Save your money and go else where. Definitely overrated.",

Another plus is the pricing. Steakhouses usually are a la carte, which can get super pricey. At Hugo's you get a lot included with your meal. I ordered the filet mignon for $59. It came with a salad (made at the table), mashed potatoes, veggies and a little dessert platter. (Chocolate covered fruit and whipped cream)   I've always had great service at Hugo's! Everyone is super friendly and I have never had any complaints. When you're greeted at the hostess stand, you're given a rose...such a nice touch! It's little things like this that set Hugo's apart from the steakhouses on the strip.   If you park in the Four Queens garage, Hugo's will stamp your parking ticket, which will make parking free!",

From the longtime servers that treat you right, to the table-side salad, to the complimentary chocolate dipped fruit, this is the place I always recommend when asked about a great dinner spot.  Both my wife and I had steaks, her the filet, and me the NY Strip, and both cooked exactly as ordered.  We skipped the appetizers and desserts due to the already included amount of food at no additional cost.  It's refreshing to be at restaurant and not have every item ala carte, and with reasonable pricing as well.  A great value for the price.",

Crab cakes were good, bisque was ok but not too flavorful more creamy... The salads were nothing special and definitely wouldn't order one if it didn't come with our entree. Compared to other steakhouses we weren't overly impressed. Service was great though!",

    "text": "There is probably no place better known by the locals here in Vegas then the city staple of Hugo's Cellar.  I could write all kinds of information about where, when, what, how to enjoy, find, experience this restaurant.  However, there are plenty of reviews for all that.  So my experience in a nutshell:  The traditional rose delivered promptly to my girlfriends' hand by the staff as we were seated.  The nice sommelier that retrieved the PInot Noir we shared as we paired our meat & fish.  A beauty of a seafood sampler or \"plateau\" arrived in perfect timing.  Wonderful Caesar salad prepared table side to our specifications.  Then the entrees; Veal Chop Natural for me; bone in.  Veal Oscar for the lady.  The food was tremendous, topped with fresh sorbet and Cherries Jubilee table side yet again.  Yup, so many words to describe how wonderful Hugo's was.  It's an experience, a little pricy.... However, I believe that in most cases you get what you pay for.  Most of the time as a serial restaurant patron I find myself staring at the check asking myself if the juice was worth the squeeze..... At Hugo's; I had some damn good juice.",

If you want to score points on a romantic date, this is the place to go for dinner.  It's located in Downtown Las Vegas, at the 4 Queens. When we walked downstairs, they greeted us and then gave my wife a fresh red rose.   We were seated and immediately were offered service. I've had the opportunity to dine at many establishments around the country and few can match the service we had at Hugo's. The customer service we received was excellent.   My wife had the New York Strip and I had the Rack of Lamb. The steak was good and the lamb was EXCELLENT. Both dishes came with salad (prepared table-side) , asparagus and garlic whipped potatoes. For desert, they brought us chocolate covered fruit and a wonderful blackberry/rasberry cheese cake.  Excellent experience overall. I would love to come back. The only thing I wished they had here was a dress-code. The decor is a little old-fashioned but, then again, we didn't go for the decor.   Visited April 2011",

We first started out with the jumbo crab cakes. They tasted awesome. The outside was nicely brown and crunchy and the inside was full of crabs.   We also had the Hugo's table-side salad. My husband and I both agreed that this must of been one of the best salad we had ever eaten. We had honey-walnut vinaigrette on our salads.  I ordered a beef wellington and the husband ordered a Filet de Boeuf Atlantis. They were both delicious.   For dessert we ordered a chocolate mousse. What can go wrong with a chocolate dessert? After all it's a dessert and chocolate. =)   Overall, we were very happy with the service and food.",

Walking through \"Freakmont\" Street, pass through the smoke filled casino of the four queens hotel and descend into another world.  The staff of Hugos remember days gone past and bring them alive in the dining experience.  From the personal attention of the wait team to the very knowledgeable, yet un-pretentious sommelier, this was just an amazing meal.    Your meal includes (not a small) salad, a very generous entree, vegies and starch.    The food was the best we'd had the entire trip and then some.  The table prepared salad set the stage.  The final coffee service with whipped cream and chocolate sticks put the perfect cap on it.    By no means a \"cheap\" meal, dinner for six of us at Hugos was expensive...but worth it.   We left completely stuffed, with five doggie bags, and very dumb smiles on our faces.  ps.

    "text": "One ofthe last vestiges of Old Las Vegas, Hugo's Cellar is a landmark buried in the midst of a row of unremarkable downtown casinos on Freemont Street. Impeccable fine dining with old school tableside service for all the traditional dishes: artistically composed caeser salads assembled before your eyes to deconstructions of ducks and flambes, the waitstaff attend to every need and whim. Drinks are expertly made as well as an attentive and world class sommelier will help you pair your food with one of 1,000's of bottles ranging from semi- affordable options to \"holy crap, my house is worth less\" options. Each table gets a team of staff at your disposal, all women recieve roses upon entry of the establishment and they provide light sorbet palette cleansers between courses. The menu is old school american fine dining and all entrees come with a custom salad made tableside with several dressings and easily a dozen different ingredients. Diners also recieve choclate dipped strawberries, apricots and a wonderful homemade whipped creme. The last entree I can recall having there was the Duck L'Orange which was almost a sexual experience. I also suggest the dirty martinis here too, almost a meal in itself and possibly the best mixed drink I've experienced yet. While not cheap, entrees can seem exspensive but keep in mind they come with salads and a light dessert. Add some sides of spinach, potatos and mushrooms for the table and a +/-$100 bottle of wine and 3 drinks came to $300 with tip for two.. The fact that Hugo's has managed to survive in the ever evolving city of Vegas when so many other famously fine dining experiences have closed should serve True testament to its continued dedication to its craft. Instead of blowing a wad of cash in the casino one night, do yourself a favor and try a truly fine dining experience. I guarantee that before the end of the meal you will feel like you've hit the jackpot!  P.S. NO this is not a modern food movement restaurant, they dont try to reinvent dishes or interpret them in their own way, and certainly the menu can be called dated and unimaginative. But thats not the point here. This is an old school experience with expected and known dishes served flawlessly.   -located in the Four Queens Hotel Casino -free parking validation at the check in counter at in the casino lobby",

I did get a rose but the place seemed as unpretentious as you can get.  There were people in jeans drinking Bud Lite everywhere!  I felt overdressed in my casual dress and hubs in his kakis and button down.   Anyway, dinner STARTED off great.  We were greeted immediately, drink orders brought promptly, dinner ordered in no time flat.  Bread basket arrived (bread just okay, nothing special) and salad cart whisked over.  We got started on our delicious salads (so fun getting to custom order at your table from the salad cart!) Then it was like 'poof', everyone disappeared!  We couldn't get a drink refill or even a glass of water to save our life.  We were so desperate we even tried to get a drink from the food runner (of course he just mumbled something about tracking down our server but never did).  To make matters worse, we were sandwiched between two very large, very loud & drunk parties so we had to shout at each other just to have a conversation.   Dinner was perfectly cooked - I had the seafood trio, he had the prime rib.  Both excellent, no complaints there.  The chocolate dipped fruit was kind of lame (dried apricots dipped in chocolate?  not so good) but whatever, it came with the meal.  We didn't get any sorbet after salad so maybe they stopped doing that?  I dunno.     Finished our fruit and sat around for another 20 minutes until my husband finally started waving his credit card around trying to catch someone's eye.  20 minutes later bill finally arrived.  Brought by the salad guy.  Ridiculous!  Had to leave because we were so parched.      4 stars for food, 1/2 a star for service and ambiance.  I'd spend my hard earned money somewhere else!",

A busy Friday night required reservations.  The good thing about this place is dinners come with veggies, potatoes and table side salad. I had the lobster bisque as an appetizer with my lamb chops.  The bisque wasn't what I was expecting.  I only had lobster bisque at one other place.  That was William B's in the old defunct Stardust.  That soup rocked and this one was meh in comparison.  Not very much goodies in this smooth and creamy soup.  Maybe this is the way it's supposed to be and William B's did it wrong.  I just liked B's better.  The table side salads were a great touch.  I had the classic ceaser which was one of the best ceasers i've had.  My lamb chops medium rare were a bit tough, but it was still flavorful.  They served it with a gravy that had a hint of habenero that kicked it up a notch.   The rest of my family had the 16 oz prime rib, the roasted chicken, and the beef wellington.  We also had a side of king crab legs to share.  This was plenty of food. I ended up getting half a wellington and more than my share of crab legs.  Needless to say, I didn't have the opportunity to de-bone the lamb chops.   I would have loved to knawl all the good meat next to the bones, but there was too much food  and in Vegas, what happens at the dining table stays at the dining table.  A very big meal and worthy of 4 stars.",

Manager Rich is the nicest guy. class act all the way. We also had show reservations, and informed Rich. He immediately went into action, told the waiters to make sure we were out before show time. Food was great, steaks to die for!!! Better than anything we had on the strip, and it wasn't ala carte. finished off nicely with chocolate covered fruits. a perfect meal, incredible service and the nicest people. We will be back!",

I had the rack of lamb which was cooked to perfection, tender and juicy. My wife had the seafood trio which was also excellent. The chocolate dipped fruit was a nice touch, but we forced down the cherries jubilee flambe at tableside...fun to watch and delicious. The decor was classic old-school and we loved it! The service from Michael, Anthony and Sergio was top-notch. :-D",

    "text": "We had read some pretty bad reviews about Hugo's but decided to trust the many more good reviews that the restaurant had received. We were not disappointed. Though the decor is heinous, it fits the tradition of the 40+ year old restaurant. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and were accommodating of my boyfriend's many allergies. The entrees seemed a little pricey at first glance, but the prices were cushioned by many complimentary items. A generous, delicious salad, palate-cleansing sorbet, and a dessert sampler were all elegantly presented free of charge.  In addition, I ordered a Raspberry Lemon Drop martini at the waiter's suggestion, and I would highly recommend it. It was delicious, and it was essentially three martini's for the price of one. They even provided me with an extra sugar-rimmed glass. Overall, despite the establishment looking 40 years out of date, we would highly recommend this restaurant. Don't let the bad reviews deprive you of an intimate dining experience.",

The lettuce was iceberg (not that I have a problem with iceberg, but you'd think for 14 bucks, they'd spring for a nice mix).  The potatoes were undercooked, the veggies were old and overcooked.  The steak at Denny's tastes better.    And, to top it off, my friend's stomach started cramping after dinner.  He threw up his dinner and immediately felt better.  The only thing I can figure is people expect it to be good because it is so expensive, then they leave town and never come back, so the owners can get away with terrible food.  Only plus was that they poor a stiff drink.  DON'T GO HERE!!!!!",

It's an 'old-style' high-backed leather booth sort of steakhouse, where every lady gets a rose before being seated. It's straight out of 'Old Vegas'. In short, they wheel an impressive 'salad cart' to your table with tons of choices, which your waiter will prepare before you, and the Prime Rib and Filet Mignon entrees were top notch too. Oh, and the service is unbelievable also. If you're in Sin City, it would be a sin to pass up Hugo's!",

I had never been to Fremont Street and wanted to go for night before we spent the rest of our vacation on the Strip. I was told Hugos Cellar was a must for dinner. We loved this restaurant.  The food was good and the staff was great.  Large quantities! We were miserable, in a good way, when we left.  Fantastic martinis!!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because we actually went to Gordon Ramsey's Steak on our actual anniversary and it was like apples and oranges to Hugos.  It was on a different level. Obviously, it is a celebrity chefs restaurant.  But for a great meal and awesome wait staff, you have to try Hugos.  If we make it back to Fremont Street, we will definitely return here!",

    "text": "This was always a classic Las Vegas dining experience for special occasions.  On our last two visits however it has not measured up to its past, or been on level with the many other dining options that Las Vegas has to offer.  While the ambiance is still there the restaurant is filled with dinners in shorts, t-shirts etc.  Not sure that this is as much a societal issue as is the restaurant's however a dress code could help this.  Bottom line, if you are wanting to experience and special night and are surrounded by diners that are dressed for any national chain its not going to feel special.    There are still some nice touches as for the dining experience including; women diners greeted with roses, the salad bar at your table, palate cleansing sorbet between salads and entrees, and complimentary chocolate dipped dried fruit at the end. The problem has been the quality of the food.  This last visit I ordered the Prime Rib, medium rare.  It was cooked properly but it was firm and lacked flavor.  However it was much better than my wife's sea scallops that were not edible as they were overcooked and drenched in oil.  Overall, there are far too many other choices in Las Vegas to choose from for fine dining based our recent visits here.",

One day I got an order to go to hugo's cellar and make a food order via app. After struggling it took me 1 hour to reach it, cause everybody knows downtown. The rude, inconsiderate, and disrespectful man at the reception treated me like nobody as if I am begging food from him. I was trying to explain to him that I have no control over people's orders and if you don't do take away why do you advertise the opposite. He finally said \"if you are not buying anything go away\".  Such people respect money only, and if I reached there to spend money he would show respect. Unfortunately, I was doing my job, which is not excluded from being the worst delivery company in supporting there drivers, and I am considering to quite. Anyway, most readers would not think it is big deal, cause they are not going to be in the same situation, but just imagine if you know people work at this job and trying to support their families, would that give receptionist the right to humiliate them?!!

Very dim and romantic setting.  Perhaps too dim because other guests around us were having trouble reading the menu. We looked at the menu before hand so we know what we want. Kona coffee for two is actually worth it and a nice experience. Husband got the beef Wellington which is 3/5. I got the duck which I will give 4/5. Portions are huge so you won't leave hungry. Table side salad is a nice touch and comes with entree. For dessert, we got the creme brulee, which turn out to be a disappointment. Creme brulee is not smooth! We were too full to get the banana foster but that seems like a better option.",

He told me to drive safe and we will see you soon. The place itself is beautiful with an old school charm. It's classy and welcoming. They give the ladies a rose as soon as you enter and then walk you to your table.   Service was great. Honestly its the best service I have ever experienced. You start out with their bread basket with butter designed into a shape of a rose. It was very pretty and the bread was fresh and warm. You ordered then the salad bar would come to you. The guy made our salads to order right in front of us. He had it down. He went through the toppings while having a full conversation with us and he never missed a beat. The salad was fabulous and my husband ate all of it if that says anything.  He is a meat and potatoes kind of guy.    Our entree's were so delicious. I had the Beef Wellington and my husband had a steak as well.  Mine was like cutting into heaven. It was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. My husband loved his steak as well. Served with mashed potatoes and a vegetable melody, it was all very very good.   Our complementary dessert was chocolate covered figs and strawberries with some whipped cream. I was completely stuffed by then. Our waiter mentioned to the Chef that it was our Wedding night so they sent us out a lava cake! I was so surprised by this. It was so good. Words seriously can not describe how delicious this was. They packed our left overs and put them in a nice bag to go for us. I ate my steak the next morning for breakfast and it still was like heaven.   I hated leaving here because it was such a beautiful night and everything was so delicious. It was the perfect way to start out our first night together as a married couple. I cannot recommend this place enough. We will forever put this on our list of places to eat when we are in Vegas.  Side note: Every employee we spoke with has been working there for years. I'm not talking like 3 years or so. The least amount of time there I heard was 7 years. They joked around and called him a young pup. Our waiter had been there for 30 plus years! It was his anniversary and he said they took very good care of him. I love hearing about places who take care of their employees.",

My husband started to but then the host took over. The price has gone up in the last 25 years we've been going here but it's understandable. My filet mignon was ok and my husbands sea bass was delicious. They had his side dish wrong but he actually liked what he got better.  I asked for a to go box which they used to wrapped in foil shaped like a swan but now it's just a box. He cleared the table and even took away my bread I was still eating to box my leftover.

Hugo's is known for their table-side salad, however the cart they presented it on was a quagmire of cross contaminated food on a filthy cart! Not an appetizing scenario.   My wife ordered the fish, which was clearly frozen and tasteless. I ordered the he strip steak which was a nice portion by not properly seasoned with salt & pepper prior to grilling.   Also, we had at least 5 different waiters which made for a disjointed experience. The fact that none of the five could provide proper service just added to our woes!

It's too bad more & more of them keep disappearing because the way things used to be in this town was awesome! Wish I could have really experienced it!   Hugo's is tucked away & it feels very intimate. When you walk in it really feels like you're stepping back in time. The host is always so nice and all ladies are given a long stem red rose. I have to give it to them because this is such a lovely touch & the experience starts...  This place is dark & romantic with lots of masculine touches all around like the art & dominant blue colors.   The food is great! The value is great as well. Meals include everything so prepare to be stuffed.   We ordered: Beef Wellington & raspberry chicken and both were very decadent. The raspberry chicken is unreal! You get perfectly cooked veggies & a starch (in my opinion the garlic mash is the best). One of the highlights of your meal will be the customized table side salad service. You get to pick all your toppings & the honey-orange-walnut dressing is divine! The lemon sorbet that comes over to cleanse the tastebuds was great & then let's not forget about the complimentary dessert. Chocolate covered apricot, figs & strawberries! And fresh whipped cream! You will love all this indulging!   My man decided to also get the shrimp cocktail which isn't worth the price tag & several drinks which were reasonably priced.   We had a lovely meal & it felt like the days of the Rat Pack.",

I read some reviews knocking the location or the environment, but to be honest, that's what I come for. Hugo's is an oasis in a sea of chaos in Downtown Las Vegas (which is an awesome spectacle worth experiencing in its own right).  You won't find many other restaurants anywhere else in the world that offer career waiters that in some cases have been working at Hugo's for decades. I'm always shocked each time I go seeing the same faces.   For the price, Hugo's can't be beat. Sure you might find a similar quality steak on the strip for the same price, but that is going to be a la carte. At Hugo's you're getting a mega salad, sorbet, sides, and dessert included with your meal. The prime rib is easily my favorite entree but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I've had seafood, beef Wellington, and several steaks, and although they're not the best in the world, they're done well and worth the price.   If you enjoy wine, this is the place to be. The sommelier's are some of the friendliest guys around, and although ordering can be intimidating, just tell them one what you're looking for and they will find it. If you're honest and just tell them a price point and flavor profile you're looking for they'll make a superb recommendation no matter your budget.   Overall Hugo's is one of the best dining experiences you'll get in Las Vegas. If you don't have a huge stick up your butt and don't mind going downtown into a casino that isn't the Bellagio, you'll love it. I recommend dressing well. Although you'll see some turkeys dressed in t-shirts and shorts, don't stoop to their level.",

Both were cook to perfection!",

    "text": "We were downtown looking for some meat, after seeing all the positive reviews from fellow yelpers, we gave Hugo's a try.  The locations a little odd in the bottom of the four queens and the decor maybe getting a little dated.  However, I thought the service was a solid 5 stars and the food 4.    The table side salad was nice and the server Victor was such a character.  I'd order the salad just to talk with Victor, he is what I would expect to be a classic Vegas persona.     In between the salad and main course they bring out the tiniest lemon Sorbet to clean your taste buds.  Never had something like that before and thought it was a nice touch.   My lady friend ordered the prime rib, which was huge.  She thought it was good but maybe a tad tough.  That sucker had to be over a pound.    I opted for the beef Wellington, I thought it was good, better then the Wellington at Gordon Ramsay steak at Paris.  Ramsays steak is really good,overall better, but Hugo's to me is classic Vegas.  They aren't wowing you with the decor and a fancy meat cart.  It's excellent service backed up with good food.   The price was actually really good, when you consider the meal includes salad and sides.",

    "text": "A friend suggested Binion's Steakhouse but they close during the holidays for a \"Deep Cleaning\" Hmmmmm, don't they clean as they go? Anyway I did a search and found Hugo's was highly rated so I booked a reservation for four at 5:00PM. My wife and I met my sister in-law and her boyfriend there, whom had traveled from California. What an amazing experience we had! From the greeting, the women get roses btw...to the seating and our approach by the first server, Michael. Every part of the process was spot on. I love that the water is poured from a chilled carafe w/o ice rather than a pitcher with ice. First, Michael took our drink order and came back with very well presented martini's. He poured them for us and left the remaining \"Two extra servings\" over ice for us. Basically, for the price of one martini you get three!! Carlos took our main order and I went with his suggested 16 oz New York cut with wild rice. Michael then began to make our salads, table-side. A great mix of greens with all the fixings of your choice, I went with the house orange vinaigrette, Amazing!!! These salads are nor small but rather large. Meal timing was perfect. Shortly after we finished our salads and made time for another round of martini's, the main course arrived. We were all amazed how the steaks turned out EXACTLY like we requested! Fresh sauteed vegetables with the sides were just fantastic! Normally, I push aside at least a few pieces of the less desirable pieces of say gristle/fat, but not here. Every single piece was perfection! Included in the meal were chocolate dipped strawberries, figs, and apricots I think. We did, however, order a rather large creme brulee, to split four ways. Access to the steak house is very easy. You park in the Four Queens parking structure and its a very short walk to the casino entrance and Bingo, you're there! I can't wait to return on my oldest son's Bday which is in January and will allow him and my youngest to enjoy their deliciousness. You will walk out of the place extremely satisfied and will be wanting to return ASAP. I hope this helps in your decision making in giving them a try. Peace out!",

The menu is similarly traditional - Beef Wellington, lobster bisque, rack of lamb, bananas foster, etc.  The food overall is excellent, there is much attention to detail, the traditional cocktails are excellent in a city full of garbage \"cocktails\" swilled in huge quantities, and service is overall excellent.  There is a complementary light dessert tray (chocolate-covered fruits, etc.) with dinner.    For anyone who wants to have really experienced Las Vegas,a dinner here is necessary.  Keep in mind the classy nature of the place and be prepared to dress adequately.",

I would see the diners leaving Hugo's and really wanted to dine there - mostly because I thought it was really cool that all of the Ladies got a long stemmed rose. Fast forward to now, and my Husband also had always wanted to eat there too, so we made plans for a Friday night.   He made reservations for us to have an early-ish dinner (6pm), and I am glad we did. There is absolutely no rush to get you in and out at Hugo's and our meal took nearly 2.5 hours. The decor is a bit old school - low ceilings, dimly lit and not a very large place. There is nothing fancy about the menu, but the cool thing is that your salad (which is prepared tableside), bread, and a small dessert platter are included with your meal. The service was good, and overall we were impressed with our experience. Sometimes, when you've heard so much about a place and have long anticpated eating there, you can end up disappointed. But I am happy to report that we were pleased with our meal. I mean, this restaurant has probably been open for around 40 years, so they must be doing something right!  This is still a very popular restaurant, even after all of these years. So you'll definitely need reservations. Also, they don't have a strict dress code and we also saw children in the restaurant.",

Hostesses escort guests to their tables presenting each lady with a rose. Low ceilings and dark walls create a throwback dinner club vibe. Martinis are served on ice, with each person getting their own cut glass ice bucket and enough boozy goodness to refill the glass three times over. Frank, Dean and the rest of the Rat Pack would have been impressed.  Food portions are pretty large and the option to split the entrees is a good one.    The staff absolutely added to the experience. If you want a good meal, good value and a great old school Vegas experience Hugo's is a must do. If you're not a fan of nostalgia, then maybe skip this one.",

After I took one bite the waiter came by and asked how everything was. I said fine. He never returned. As I continue to eat steak I was constantly pulling out hunks of fat from my mouth and placing them on the plate...it was really bad. I order ribeyes all the time as that is my preferred steak, however, this steak was so fatty and had almost no taste that I felt it necessary to write this review.

    "text": "My husband made reservations here for my birthday on August 9th. It's taken a while to write this review because we were really looking forward to a nice dinner and it did not live up to our expectations. It's easy to find in the 4 Queens. Upon arrival I was greeted with a rose and seated immediately. The 2 waiters we had were extremely nice. I ordered a rum and coke my husband stuck with water. Went over the menu ordered our food. Bread followed, salad shortly after which was amazing. I didn't expect it to be so filling but it was. We were served a raspberry sorbet after our salad and our dinner came within a few minutes after.  So the reason for the 3 stars isn't about the incident that happened which was unpredictable and not the restaurant's fault it's about how it was handled after. Seated right next to us was a group of four. And my husband noticed that their waiter had said there was a protocol they had to follow. So he was watching but not being obvious and he told me that there was something wrong with the gentleman at the table. He looked ill and everyone was very worrisome security came to take a look at him and ask what was going on which we could not hear their conversation. We were just finishing up our plates and casually glancing over because he honestly looked like he was going to have a heart attack or something serious. Not even a couple minutes after our plates were clear I looked up and this gentleman regurgitated all over himself, the table and floor. Which you can imagine is very unsettling after you finish your meal. After that I felt sick and grossed out because I just witnessed that. I told my husband and he was like are you serious? We were waiting for our dessert and just kinda looking around because at this point the party had left and everyone is going about their business and waiting on tables and what not just bypassing this disgusting table. It was starting to smell and minutes were going by and we weren't offered to sit at a different table. Just sat there next to this damn throw up getting nauseous. I finally got up and left while my husband took care of the bill. The waiters were nice to him and asked if I was coming back so they could sing happy birthday to which my husband responded no she is not. They packed our dessert and gave my drink to go. Nothing else was offered. Apologies for sure and while I don't hold any grudges to my waiters because they were so amazing and nice I honestly can't believe we had to sit there next to that. Minutes were going by and not only was our mood out the window I'm sure most of the people in the restaurant was. BUT we were the closest table to this which was very disgusting. How are we suppose to even have dessert when we're looking at throw up?! The food was great I'll give them that. But there needs to be a protocol for something like that to where customers shouldn't have to be smelling and looking at that. That gentleman should've known his body more to get up and go to the bathroom but we shouldn't have had to sit next to throw up either. I'm not sure if I would want to go back.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. The look and feel of It is awesome.  1. I only had 1 drink. Not because I wasn't feeling thirsty, but because our server didn't stop by our table for the entire second half of the meal.   2. Sitting next to us was an obnoxiously loud drunk party. I know that the restaurant can't really control this, but they didn't see a problem giving me a hard time because of the hat I was wearing.   3. The ribeye I ordered was rare or even blue rare. I wanted medium rare. See the photos. The steak literally had no seasoning on it. I'm no steak snob, but I've had plenty of ribeyes before and this one was tasteless. I had to use table salt in order to choke it down.   The salads and the pallet cleansers (sorbet) that they served were excellent.   Maybe it was just bad luck or bad timing, but based on the price tag on the experience and the food, I won't be back.",

The salmon was very good with the sides being average.  The crab cake was very good and a shareable size. The wait staff was very attentive.  The host presented all women with a rose upon going to the table.  The raspberry cosmo was a recommended drink.  It was enough to share and very tasty. The meal over all was nice.  The only negative for me was the cost of the meal.  It was good, and I don't mind paying good money for good food but it was bit inflated for what we got. Otherwise the restaurant gives you a great experience and good food.",

    "text": "So for real I don't know why we haven't visited Hugo's Cellar until now, I think the location turned me off a bit but seriously bad on my part. My hubby knew it's been on my to try list forever so what better time to try it than Valentines. He called about 2 weeks prior to but was told they were fully booked until Sunday, 2/17. Oh well we've waited this long lol.   This place genuinely epitomizes old Vegas, with its old school charm and attention to details. As you enter the ladies are given a single red rose, nice touch. Then you're escorted to your table and introduced to your servers: Mark, Jaime and Teddy. Their service is like a well oiled machine, very precise and top notch.  I decided on an Apple Martini while the hubby had iced tea ha! Served table side with accompanying bucket of ice for the remaining drink. Bread service came with a cute rose butter, didn't want to fill up on that but just had to taste for research purposes lol. I had every intention of saving room for dessert and wanted to skip appetizers but hubby wanted to try the spinach dip with crab. Definitely not a regrettable decision as that had to be the best I've had. Next came the Table side salad where they wheel a cart with 11 salad ingredients to choose from and 3 dressing choices. I opted for the Honey Walnut orange and hubby the classic Caesar. It's delicious and a sizable portion. After that was a raspberry sorbet to cleanse your palate prior to the main entree which was a 16oz Ribeye steak with fingerling potatoes and a medley of veggies and mushrooms for me and Hubby chose a 10oz Filet Mignon with garlic mash and veggies. It was accompanied with sauces but honestly it didn't need it at all. Steaks were perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful. They then give you a hot towel to clean your hands before dessert. A tray of complimentary chocolate covered strawberries, apricots and figs are brought to end your meal with a bang. Unfortunately for us we didn't have any room for additional dessert even if we wanted to. The bananas foster will have to wait until next visit, already looking forward to that.   With a 25% tip it was still only $220. Very affordable, almost dirt cheap for the quality of food and service you get. We have been to some steak houses on the strip and paid twice as much with same quality food but less attention to details. Thank you Jaime and Teddy for a memorable night. We will be back.",

The prime rib here was very flavorful and like 3in thick. You MUST MUST TRY THE BANANAS FOSTER.   Extensive wine list and in house sommelier to help.  The as a very classy touch by giving every woman a long stem red rose to take home.   While you can come in casual clothes it is low upscale and I recommend making it a fancy date and dressing up.",

    "text": "Hugos has a lot of classic charm reminiscent of old vegas.  Enjoyed a 3 course meal here with 8 friends last month.  This romantic cellar is a nice break from the hustle and bustle of Vegas, and it was wonderful to have a slow paced meal.  I'd say overall the ambiance and service were top notch, cocktails were delicious, but the food was unremarkable.  Enjoyed my lemon drop martini, and tasted my friend's espresso martini which was also delicious.  I've never been to a restaurant that makes your salad table side- it was pretty entertaining esp for a table of 8 to see all the different concoctions.  I recommend Hugos try new table bread, it was terrible (although the butter in the shape of a rose was a nice touch).  I ordered a seafood medley of salmon, shrimp & scallops.  Small medley- wish I had just ordered scallops, they were the best thing on my plate.  The salmon was dry & overcooked and the garlic sauce and rice pilaf were incredibly salty.  Enjoyed the sorbet cleanse in between courses and the complimentary gigantic chocolate covered strawberries.  The seafood medley was over $60, but if you factor in the bread, salad, sorbet & chocolate strawberries the price is more reasonable.  Again our waiters, the wine expert, and ambiance were absolutely wonderful.",

Over cooked rubbery and bland not what we would have expected from higher end restaurant. The service was great salad was the best part of the meal. We have stayed Downtown Vegas for years and have had better at Hugo's in the past. We were a little disappointed with the quality. The quality of the food didn't match the price.

    "text": "Hugo's Cellar was the first \"fancy schmancy\" restaurant that my husband (then boyfriend) tried in Vegas about six years ago. I remember being very impressed by the high class service and the intricately made food. I wondered, was this place good because it was in my pre-Yelp days? Or was it really THAT good? Yes, sir, this place is as good as I remembered.  This restaurant is in an unlikely location. It's inside Four Queens. Downtown Las Vegas has drastically improved over the last few years but admittedly I still hold my purse close to me when I walk around. I would highly suggest to valet your car because the garage elevator was broken and I had to go down four flights of stairs in heels! Hey, if you're going to a fancy schmancy restaurant, you might as well splurge on valet!  Once you get to the restaurant, ladies are given a single red rose. The restaurant is dark and has a old school Vegas feel. We were seated in a booth, and I appreciated the romantic ambiance. Waiters were all wearing tuxedos. They even poured water with a certain flair.  My favorite part about this place is the table side prepared salad. It comes free with your entree and you get an array of toppings to choose from! They give a cute mini raspberry sorbet to cleanse your palette. I ordered the ribeye steak and my husband got the Chilean sea bass. We both savored every single bite and still had leftovers to take home!   I'm not sure if it's because they knew it was our anniversary but we got hooked up with lots of desserts! We got an assortment of chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots to dip in whipped cream. Then we got a chocolate mousse cake that was melt-in-your-mouth amazing! Oh my, my mouth is watering just writing about it.  If you're looking for romance, good food and great service, you can't go wrong with Hugo's Cellar!",

The attire should be business casual, some people dressed more formal and some a little more casual, but one should never show up in tee shirt and shorts.  Onto the atmosphere, it is romantic, lit for the most part with candles at your table and the rest of the lights on medium.  The wait staff is fantastic and attentive!  They explain everything to you in detail and also make recommendations. No notepad is needed the waiters remember everything in their heads.  Food also comes out at a good pace, none of those 1 hour waits between appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I dare say after you are finished with your food about 10-15 minutes later the next course arrives.  My friend and I each ordered the lobster bisque,  plus crab cakes for appetizers, then the seafood combo (crabcake, scallops and salmoln i think) and I forget if I had cheesecake or apple pie. My memory is a little fuzzy.  The food was delicious, but the entree was a tad on the small side for the price.  Also order the coffee for two, it gets brewed right in front of you in a fancy contraption.  The meal came out to only 150 before tax and tip.  This included 3 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, 2 coffees and 2 cokes.",

Having said that...the service was impeccable. The waiters and servers could not have been more helpful. Our every need was met and we never had to ask for anything.   The price was high but not outrageous. You must realize when you are paying those kind of prices, you are paying for the hidden extras like the free rose for ladies and the plate of chocolate fruits that comes \"complimentary\".   If service is your desire..this is the place. It is fancy and high class. Just don't expect a lot from the food. You won't be disappointed.",

We were too full to get dessert, but saw that they have bananas foster they prepare table side. Wudu our water attendant was fun!",

Every woman is handed a long stem rose , they have been doing this for years. They will make you feel welcomed as soon as you enter till you leave. Well worth checking out for a nice evening out especially if your looking to make your dinner memorable and romantic.",

    "text": "When I was told the best restaurant in Vegas was in the Four Queens, I was extremely skeptical.  It isn't the best casino in town, and to say that it's a step up from a dump is a compliment.  However, when you get to Hugo's Cellar, and walk down those stairs, you're entering a whole different world.  Probably the best date restaurant anywhere!   They give all the ladies a red rose when you arrive.  Then they seat you and give you the menus.  You order, then a few minutes later, they come by with a salad cart and they prepare your salad tableside.  I've never seen anything like that.  Then after your salad, they bring you a palette cleansing mini-cone of sorbet.  Then they bring you your entree and the food is amazing!  And after dinner, they bring you a tray of dipped strawberries, apricots and figs with whipped cream.  It is very intimate and romantic.  You really need a reservation and still be prepared to wait a little bit past your time.  It is well worth the wait.  And all of the servers are top notch and very attentive.  The prices seem high, but for what you get, compare it to other top notch restaurants in the city, and you'll see what a great deal this is.",

The prices were high but we were ready to pay for the experience.  All meals included bottle water, a delicious salad make table side, and chocolate covered strawberries.  Chocolate covered dates and apricots were also offered but we were not interested.  My husband had the 10 oz filet and it was cooked to perfection.  I had the beef wellington, which I have always wanted to try.  Both dishes were amazing and both steaks seemed much bigger than 10 oz.    I've tried and tried to find a problem with the meal.  Maybe too much salad dressing?  The meal was amazing and we cannot wait to get back to Vegas to eat here again.",

Not many normal salad veggies (no cukes, olives, carrots, peppers) but the concept was great.  Food was presented in a timely manner.  The servers were very friendly.  There was little seasoning on the beef (I had an end cut of prime rib and my  husband the filet de beouf.)  Mashed potatoes, wild rice, and veggies were good.  Fruit platter was good.  Brought us a piece of cheesecake because it was our anniversary.  Very thoughtful.  Overall it was good...  Just not WOW.",

My wife and I shared our five year anniversary here yesterday, I had put in reservations online with a request for a booth in the special instructions, also mentioning the anniversary. when we got there we were greeted, and offered a table but told a booth would be available shortly. I only waited maybe five minutes. it's got such a great vibe, a very classy old school feel. They hand your lady a rose as they take you to be seated. The drinks are expertly crafted, I had an old fashioned while my wife had a dirty martini. We started with escargot, which I'd never had. Wow. Seriously, a revelation. I've been missing out. The rest of the meal was nothing less than superb. I will definitely be back, next time I'll have to make sure I save room for dessert (even though they suprised us with one).",

One of my favorite parts was the table side salad preparation because you have so many options, it's like a salad bar! The cocktails are so generously pored with an overflow glass that you really only need one! You think it can't get any better until you are served your entree! Perfectly prepared!

Fremont Street (and all of downtown) just isn't a safe area. The restaurant itself it great- but you take your life in your hands trying to get to it. Crime, homelessness, drugs, abound all around Fremont. I may not go back simply because I was so terrified walking to the 4 Queens and back to the Nugget for a cab.  -They had to butterfly the filet mignon",

I felt like I was stepping back in time when I walked in.  There's even an old school smell that accompanies the place, one of those nostalgic smells of another place and time.  The atmosphere is quite romantic, as the lights are perfectly staged for an evening of fun.  =0)  Every couple is given a long stem red rose for their significant other.  I found that to be a rather charming touch.    The wine is absolutely delicious and they have their very own wine connoisseur who delights in telling you a story or two about his wine experience working at Hugo's over the years.  He's quite personable.  ;0)  He promised he'd help finish the bottle of wine off if we had any problems with it.  =0)  The martini's are to die for as well!  I had one that seemed like 2 and a half....wow---is all I have to say about that.    The food is absolutely delicious and the service was superb!  Before I kick in to detail about how wonderful the food was, let me say that every entree comes with seasoned vegetables and baby red potatoes, a fresh salad, fresh bread, sorbet and chocolate dipped fruit.  I kid you not...really.  =0)    So, carrying on---We had the Fabulous Michael as our marvelous server and he was SUPERB, with an in-depth knowledge on all of the meals offered.  I opted for the awesome Salmon and my pal opted for the Chilean Sea Bass.  They were both EXCELLENT!!!!    Prior to the dinner coming over they have a huge salad cart that comes around and you can select exactly what you want on your salad.  I was pretty full just from the salad.  =0)  But, I pressed on and ate a little bit of everything.   Well, we were quite full, but the Banana Fosters looked like such an awesome presentation that we decided to order that just for the experience.  =))  The experience is quite unique and I recommend giving it a try!  You must!!  You will be quite delighted, I promise you.  Yvette L. Brownstone from Ventura, CA",

    "text": "When it comes to a romantic night out in Vegas, this is my #1 recommendation.  Hugo's Cellar is extraordinary.  Located on Fremont street, in the basement of  the 4 Queens Hotel, this is one place in Vegas you should not pass up.  You begin your evening checking in with the Maitre D', and grabbing a seat in their small but well appointed bar area.  When your table is ready, they give any women in your party long stemmed red roses to set the ambiance for the evening before leading you through their intimate dining area to your table.  Your wait staff will stop by, introduce themselves, and get drink orders. (Yes, I said wait staff - you will have three waiters jumping to get you whatever you need to make your dinner fabulous.)  They will also offer to send over their award winning Sommelier to advise on your wine options.  They have a well appointed wine cellar, and a wide variety of bottles to choose from.    After your orders are placed, and your appetizers are finished, one of your waiters will bring a cart to the table, and make each person a generously portioned tossed salad, right at your table.  Their salad dressings are all wonderful, and they have a nice selection of salad toppers to choose from.  After salad, you will be given a miniature sorbet ice cream cone as a palette cleanser before the main entree arrives, and this is when your taste buds will do a dance of joy.  Their food is AMAZING.  Their prime rib is some of the best in town, but their Raspberry Chicken is my whole reason for going to Hugo's.  It is DIVINE.  My wife loves their Beef Wellington, and my in-laws both love the Queen's Lobster.  After your meal is complete, you waiters will bring a tower of chocolate dipped fruit to share while you peruse the dessert menu. I can't comment on the dessert offerings because their food is so incredible I've never been able to save enough room to actually contemplate ordering one.  I can say that the chocolate dipped figs and strawberries are delightful.  The best part is that at Hugo's, their prices do not match the extravagance of their service.  An average evening with dinner, a shared appetizer, and 2 glasses of wine or adult beverages, and our average ticket is about $150 after tip.  For a dining experience like Hugo's, I have spent easily twice that much at other establishments.  Do yourself and your wife a favor, and treat yourselves.  it is worth every penny.",

The complementary chocolate dipped fruit was the perfect sweet treat at the end but they even took it a step over the top and surprised us with a chocolate lava cake because we were also celebrating a birthday.

The salad toppings and dressing selection was vast; the result was delicious! Our entrees were generously portioned and tasted great. As we were celebrating an anniversary and a birthday, a special dessert was presented to the celebrating parties; the occasion was spelled out in chocolate on the plates. Very good! We topped off our meal with coffees and a dried fruit/chocolate/whipped cream platter. Needless to say, we were beyond satisfied (i.e. stuffed!) when we left. Each lady in our group was presented with a rose, which was an appreciated touch. In sum, we felt welcomed, appreciated, and were excellently treated.

The classiness, romance and \"old-school\" nature of this place cannot be understated.  My wife does not eat meat but pines for seafood as good as HUGO'S CELLAR at other high-end restaurants. While their steaks are not of the caliber of some high-end steakhouses, the prime rib here is astounding, you may not be able to enjoy prime rib anywhere else after you have had it at HUGO'S CELLAR. The other entrees are all excellent and the price is reasonable for portion and quality, especially compared to some of the high-end places popping up in Vegas.  If I have complaints they are minimal - the legendary custom salad cart seems to produce smaller salads than even form just a few years ago and some of the newer wait-staff is not as in love with the HUGO'S experience as the old team.  But this is quibbling - bring the love of your life here on your next Vegas trip. It will be a great experience.",

    "text": "What a gem. I was pretty blown away by Hugo's in every way possible. Perhaps my expectations were low or it was just really great. Now, I'm not exactly sure what \"old Vegas\" felt like, but the food and service that Hugo's provided was what I would have imagined \"old Vegas\" to be like. I would advise that you make reservations. There was a couple of men who walked up to the host just before we did and they were told the wait would be at least 2 hours.   It was my boyfriend's birthday and each year, I try to find a local gem to take him to - something that was different than the usual Strip offerings. Prior to September 2015, I had never even heard of Hugo's. I found it on Yelp and after reading the many positive reviews, I decided we had to go. I have never ventured into a Downtown casino and thought that the parking situation would be similar to the ones on the Strip. Drive in through the front and either valet or self park. Not really the case here. Hugo's is located inside the Four Queens Hotel & Casino. Google Maps and Waze directs you to the front entrance on Fremont. All parking, however, is on Carson. Because of this, we were 10 minutes late getting to Hugo's, Even so, the host had a sense of humor about it and gave us a choice between a cozy booth or a table. After we selected the booth, he plucked out a beautiful, long-stemmed red rose from a basket of roses and presented it to me (as they do to every lady dining at Hugo's).   The restaurant itself isn't huge. It is dimly lit and the decor really is reminiscent of \"old Vegas\" in a glamorous and romantic way. The waitstaff was all dressed in tuxes and fairly mature. Our server was Michael. He took the time to explain and validate our meal choices by telling us how great the dishes were, and the care it took to prepare those dishes.   For the appetizer, we ordered the crab cakes. Let me tell you...they were the best crab cakes we had ever had. Moderately-sized patties made of lump crab meat with just the right amount of crust. It came with some kind of aioli but I honestly couldn't tell you about it. I just remember the crab cake. I didn't want it to end.   Once the appetizer has been cleared comes the salad cart which comes with every entree. A different waiter wheeled the cart over to our table, gave us each our choice out of 4 different dressings. Then they go through the cart, asking you which ingredients you want/don't want. Once you've picked everything, the salad is tossed and served in front of you. It was a pretty good portion of a very delicious salad.  Now getting to the best part. I ordered the Beef Wellington. Michael recommended I get it medium rare, which I did and I have zero regrets. It was perfect. The puff pastry crust was flaky and moist, concealing the filet of beef topped by a piece of deliciously and politically incorrect food (foie gras). My boyfriend ordered the ribeye medium rare and it was cooked to perfection, juicy and tender.   You'd think after all that food, we would have been too full for anything else. You're dead wrong. We each had a cappuccino and were going to call it quits until a server brought over the dessert tray. We couldn't turn down the chocolate lava cake and I'm glad we didn't. Gluttonous? Definitely. Worth it? Oh yea.  Also, when Michael took our payment, he also offered to validate our parking ticket. We, in our food-induced fog, would have forgotten to validate. 5 stars for the food. 5 stars for the service.",

The wife went with the beef wellington and I got the rack of lamb which were both fantastic.    They gave us 2 complimentary desserts.  One was a plate of things dipped in chocolate and the other was 2 chocolate coated gelatos shaped into hearts.  Dropped a little over a $100 for everything but I found it to be well worth it.

I'll admit I was a bit put off by the prices but once the server explained the menu, I was so ready to dig in. I ordered the steak with garlic mashed potatoes and veggies. DELICIOUS!!! The entree came with a salad which is prepared in front of the table as you tell the server what ingredients you'd like. After salad, they served us a lemon sorbet on a cone to clean our palettes. Then came the entree and after that, was dessert which was chocolate covered strawberries, baby figs and dates. OMG!!! I was pleasantly stuffed. They also have an amazing dessert platter. My husband ordered the creme brulee and said it was phenomenal. Wow!! It really put the cherry on top for the occasion we were celebrating.

    "text": "We ate here last night and, sad to say, it was less than stellar. We called for a reservation at 5 hoping to get in at 7:00. It was short notice I know. At first, Rich, the manager said not until 9:00. I said ok we'll go somewhere else. Then he said we could come at 6:30. Great! I wish we hadn't gotten in.  Let me start off my saying this is not a cheap restaurant by any means and we knew that. When we walked in as per usual, they gave me a rose. They give Roses to all the female guests.  We ordered drinks which were fine. A little light, but not bad. For an appetizer, we had the escargot which was really good. I was none to pleased when the dirty dishes remained on our table for an extended length of time. I finally stacked them and put them by the edge of the table hoping one of the 3 people taking care of us would notice.  Erik was our head waiter. He disappeared and I called over Oscar to order a bottle of wine. He stated he could not take orders for bottles of wine only the Sommelier could. We had to wait for him. That was about a 15 minute wait. I've known the sommelier there for years and mentioned to him I wasn't too pleased with the service so far. He said I should tell Rich, the manager. I decided to wait it out and see how things progressed. They went downhill from there.  I ordered the Veal Oscar and my husband ordered the filet. First, they give you a salad made table side. It is fine. It is a lettuce salad with your choice of dressing and toppings.   My veal came and it was awful. It tasted fishy. I didn't say anything to my husband, but told him to try a bite. He said the identical thing. I tried his steak. It was dry on the ends and you needed a lot of sauce to get it down.  I had to track down Erik again as I was not paying $49 for bad veal. When I was able to get him and told him the veal was bad, he got rather indignant and stated that the only thing he could get to me was the prime rib. I guess it was sitting there. I did not want prime rib. He got very angry, took the plate and walked away. I just shared my husband's steak with him.  I told John, the sommelier, about the altercation with the waiter. He said to tell Rich. I told Rich what happened and even he didn't offer me something I would like better. He said he would give me his card before I left for a free meal. Yeah right. This meal should have been free. They gave us a desert for our anniversary and you could tell it was not fresh, it had been pulled from the freezer. There was ice falling off of it.  We got the bill and they did take the drinks and my veal off, but charged us $17.00 for the salad that was supposed to come with the meal and that was just wrong!  Before he delivered the bill, Erik came back as I'm sure he was told to by the manager to  make it right. Instead he began arguing with me. Hey jerk I'm the customer.  So for one entree and one desert we ended up with a $129.00 bill. Of course, I couldn't find Erik again to discuss the charge for the salad. On the bill, there is a place for 2 tips. One for the server and one for the sommelier. I gave john 20% of what the wine cost. I gave Erik $1. He didn't deserve anything. Never saw the manager again either. So much for the card for the meal.  This was totally unacceptable for a restaurant of their caliber. I've been eating here since the 1980's, but I won't be going back. Too many other good restaurants in Vegas to choose from. This was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant in Vegas!",

I noted when I made the reservations that we were celebrating our anniversary and it was not acknowledged at all by our servers, the sommelier did say happy anniversary after we said we were celebrating.    I was so excited to try hugo's cellar and I'm sad that it was such a disappointment.  We got there early for our reservation so we could go to a show.  We got seated right away, got our drink orders taken after a few minutes and didn't see either of our servers for almost 30 minutes.  Nobody even acknowledged that we were just sitting there waiting for our server.    My boyfriend asked an employee about getting our order taken, they didn't know who was our server, he came back to the table and we waited like another 10 minutes for one of our servers to come to the table.  We told him that we wanted to order an appetizer but we were running late now since we had waited for so long.  He didn't even apologize for leaving us sitting there for over 30 minutes.  We had to skip the appetizer and order the main course.   We got the included tableside salad but I felt like I had to rush while eating it.   I work as a server and am not unreasonable but I expect good service, even an apology for making us wait and an acknowledgement of our anniversary would have been nice.",

You could imagine our disappointment when 7 of us dined & were not able to order an appetizer along with our drinks without first ordering our meal. The assistant manager begrudgingly agreed after much discussion to grant us that request. It took 20+ minutes to receive, during a not-packed evening. Our servers were apologetic & attentive as usual despite that Jon, our favorite sommelier, was not there. My husband was ready to call Andiamo's at the D where we had had a terrific dinner for 10 a few weeks before. After dinner we requested our leftovers but when we got home, we found just a portion in each box. Normally, I'd ignore that but not after the condescending, boorish treatment by the assistant manager earlier. He responded scoffingly: Do you expect me to drive over & deliver them? I responded that I wanted the manager to call me the next day so I could explain the evening's experiences. Well, it's been 11 days. I get your message loud & clear, Mr. Assistant. Instead of Hugo's we will dine with friends, business clients & family at our other favorite restaurants: Bouchon, T-Bones, Andiamo's, Botero, & so many others.",

We also ordered a couple of drinks at the bar and the bartender was so cool, he also came to our table to see how we were doing! Hugos is a hidden gem in the 4 queens! We will definitely bring family and friends back again.",

Then we came back in and our table still wasn't ready, so we sat at the bar.  We ordered a shot of jack and a shot of johnny black.  The shots were in rocks glasses and were almost filled up.  for $7 each? like seriously? no complaints here!  So needless to say, b4 we even sat at the table, we had a small buzz.  We were led to the table with the rose, and of course I got such a great feeling and knew the dinner would be perfect.  The wine sommelier was humorous and knowledgeable.  I think we ordered a bottle of merlot, but i could be wrong! LOL (damn those \"shots\")  Most of dinner was a blur...Of course, the salad was great! (one of my favorite parts of the meal) and I remember having the sea scallops for my main meal and I remember the portion being huge and really good.  He had the veal and loved it too.    Of course, the chocolate covered strawberries and apricot w/ the homemade whipped cream topped off a great dining experience, once again. :)  LOVE THIS PLACE~",

I did enjoy the gentleman who made it    For our main course my boyfriend had the stuffed shrimp which was also very dry. We ordered a side of sauce but that didn't help much. I ordered the filet and shrimp au poivre which the best thing we had. It was good but I wouldn't say $58 good.    The complimentary chocolate dipped fruit is the reason I'm giving them a 3. That was pretty amazing and the manager took my boyfriends shrimp off the bill.   Don't really think I will ever make it back here.",

The manager is extremely rude and not at all accommodating. I tried to organize a dinner party for about 30 people here, the manager told me that he was unwilling to accommodate a party of our size during dinner. He said we could come at 5:30 or at 9 because our party would take up too much space and he had other patrons to think about. Guess what manager, you just turned 30 people guaranteed to order 30 dinners... Idiot.   I've never been spoken to so rudely. I'll never come here again. There are several steakhouse in the Las Vegas area, no need to come to this one and be treated like crap.",

    "text": "I was really excited to finally get a chance to try this old school gem that I had heard so many great things about.  I took my friend here for his birthday and we just loved it.  Unfortunately, we were both coming from the Yelp event at Ellis Island and had eaten a little (a LOT) so we weren't as hungry as we should've been.  However, we both got the tableside salad, which was great, and an entree. I ordered the Filet de Beouf Atlantis which is a filet mignon wrapped in bacon served Oscar style (with crab).  It was really good, but I can't say it was blow-me-away delicious.  The quality of the steak is just not comparable to other steakhouses on the Strip.    My friend ordered the prime rib, and it too was delicious, but there seemed to be a lot of fat on it.  The flavor was great though and it was juicy and tender.    The service was on-point.  It was a Wednesday night so it was pretty slow.  The servers were very attentive and nice.  The sommelier came over and took our wine order and they were out of the wine we ordered but he suggested something else in its place that ended up tasting amazing.    The restaurant is very dark and romantic and definitely has that old-Vegas feel. Though I've had better steak, this was a unique dining experience and we really enjoyed it.  You can get a voucher from Tix4Tonight (not the one IN 4 Queens, but any other store) and get 25% off your entire check including alcohol. Can't beat that!",

    "text": "My fiance and I are celebrating our 5 yr anniversary this weekend, and because we don't eat much red meat at home he wanted to go to a steakhouse. In my search for one I came across Hugo's. The reviews sold me on trying this place. I called in the morning to make reservations but was told the restaurant did not have any employees in until 2:00 PM. So if this is where you are thinking of going reserve ahead of time or you'll have to wait until 2, and hope you get lucky with an early dinner reservation. The only time they had available for us was 9:30 PM. We got to our reservations 30 minutes early and they immediately accommodated us. The host even mentioned he remembered talking to me this afternoon. That definately impressed us. We were greeted by our waiter very quickly, he and one other waiter made sure our night went smoothly. I have to say their service was great! Right away we were given 3 types of fresh bread and butter. That was followed by a salad made at your table side by the waiter. We ordered the Filet and Shrimp, and the Filet le beuf (I think that's how you spell it). His was medium well, and mine was medium. Both steaks were delicious, but we liked the medium one best. That's not all, they brought us dessert! Fruits dipped in chocolate and whipped cream. Not to mention they also gave us a chocolate lava cake in celebration of our anniversary. For our entire dinner, a glass of red cabernet and one cranberry vodka (for the Mr., taxes and tip, we spent approx $170.00. We are super stuffed right now. My fiance is currently laying in bed in a food coma lol...I can't forget to mention they gift a red rose to every woman when you check in. At the end of the meal they wrap the stem with foil paper so you won't get water on yourself and for easy travel. We will most definately be returning!   Thank you to Rawshad, Glenn, and the busser (sorry I didn't catch your name) for making tonight special.",

We had escargot for the appetizer, the ribeye steak medium rare with freshly made horseradish sauce on top. It's a must I highly recommend you try it with the sauce since there is an option. I ordered an appletini and they gave me a glass bottle in a little ice caddy which came out to be three drinks total. The waiters add a nice little touch by wrapping the bottom of the rose in tinfoil and each waving goodbye on your way out. I felt very special and taken care of the entire time. It made me wish that everyone could experience a night like that at least once in their life. I went with family, but I would recommend for a couples romantic anniversary dinner. Just be sure to make a reservation.",

The mood is very casual and dim. They seated us in a more private area all the way in the back. Our reservation was at opening, so it wasn't crowded. They have a good variety on their menu and the party had the prime rib, Chilean sea bass, chicken, ravioli, and I had the rib eye. The steak was OK. Wanted a little more flavor to it and it was a good size. Oh, and the salad that's included in the meal was made to order. That was nice. I had the creamy peppercorn with egg, shrimp, croutons, and pine nuts. Very delicious and simple. They serve bottled water as well as part of the meal. Then a complimentary dessert of chocolate covered strawberry, white chocolate covered fig, and chocolate covered apricot. After the meal, we only needed the small dessert with a cup of coffee. The coffee was served with a dark chocolate stick and cinnamon stick. Made the coffee flavorful. The experience was nice. The servers were great! Very attentive to our needs and cordial.

Saying \"It's a great place to eat\" doesn't give nearly the amount of credit that this place deserves. Dining here is an all around luxurious experience. The price is slightly higher than average, but for a very good reason: everything about this place goes above and beyond even high expectations. I absolutely loved this wonderful restaurant for so many reasons. Even if you find no reason to be downtown, or have no desire to go to Freemont street, I still would encourage you to make the trip to the Four Queens for this experience alone. From the moment you walk in, they hand you a rose, seat you and put that rose in a vase. The staff is always attentive and have an in depth knowledge on everything from the way the food is cooked to how the taste should be. The food is absolutely out of this world. Their food is made with such care and attention youre sure to love anything you order. The attention to details such as the type of water you're given, to the butter being kept warm, to even a small rock candy to stir your espresso is just beyond amazing. Best dinner I've had, best service to date, and most wonderful experience I could ask for!",

    "text": "Overview: Classy traditional dining with all of the extras.  Don't let it's location fool you.  Hugo's is the real deal in classic Vegas charm, a True hidden gem.  Make a reservation ahead of time- they are often booked in advance.    About the experience: As a local, Hugo's Cellar is my favorite restaurant in town and I have been bringing family and friends here for over a decade.  The service and food never disappoints.   Located in the back of the smoky Four Queens Casino floor you will need to take the elevator down or use the stairs to enter the \"cellar\".  Upon being greeted, the Maitre d' will had each lady a long stem red rose and seat you at your table.  The server helpers are quick with the complimentary bottled water, bread and drink orders.  Hugo's has a pretty darn good wine list and a sommelier on staff to help you with your wine choice.  The menu is fairly simple with your classic seafood, chicken and steak choices.  I am a big fan of the Chilean Sea Bass prepared with the seasoned bread crumbs.  The Filet is always to perfection as well.   One of the highlights of the meal is the table side salad preparation.  The waiter will freshly prepare your salad with an abundance of toppings such as pine nuts, boiled tomatoes, eggs, shrimp, multiple cheeses, etc.  Absolutely delicious.    After the salad course you will get a small sorbet cone to cleanse your palate for the main course. -- Fun, right?   I have often times skipped the main course just because the bananas foster here is fabulous.  It is one of the few restaurants left in the country that still does tableside flaming desserts.... and boy do they do it good.  It doesn't get much better than cool ice cream topped with ripe bananas, cinnamon and freshly made rummed caramel sauce.   If you do not opt for a traditional dessert Hugo's does bring you freshly whipped cream served with chocolate dipped strawberries, figs and apricots.   Finally, don't forget the coffee.  This is my mother's favorite part- served with mint sticks and more hand made whipped cream.  If you have room, they do make an excellent chocolate martini served with it's own ice bucket and shaker.   While in Vegas, be sure to check this place out and bring your appetite.  You will not leave hungry:)",

First, hidden gem or not, it's still the basement at the 4 Queens, a less than lovely old time casino/hotel down on Fremont.  Don't get my wrong, I like Fremont Street and don't expect the flash of the Strip, but the 4 Queens is in my view a lower tiered hotel/casino.    The room is dark and it was crowded and we got stuck at a table by the door to the bar.  I thought it was noisy and too busy to be a romantic gem that everyone goes on about here on Yelp and other review sites.  Service.  The older hostess seated us quickly, but she really was just there to take us to the table and didn't make us feel welcome at all.  I don't expect a brass band, but a warm friendly welcome is always nice.  Then there was our waiter, well, let's just say our waiter was not one of the stellar ones that I observed at other tables.  His heart just didn't seem to be in his job tonight.  I don't know it that's every night or if he is just not as good as some of the old school waiters seemed to be.  He wasn't there most of the time and wasn't personable and attentive as other waiters I was observing at other tables.  There were no pleasantries exchanged or even small talk, just order taking.  Started with drinks which were nicely made and bread butter.  Believe or not, we had stale or day old flat bread.  I told the busser and he just asked if we wanted more....you mean like more stale bread!  Uh, no thanks.  The salad really is a nice touch.  Made table side does make it fun and it is fresh and tasty and nice.  But again, no small talk or chat from the waiter.  I had the rib eye.  The meat was cooked to perfection, but I wasn't sure what the unnecessary sauce or gray was on the meat.  The vegetables were cool to cold and the potato was about the same.  It was a good, but not great steak.  My wife had the scallops and she had to send them back because they were covered in a nasty tasting sauce.  The waiter had them redone and they put the sauce on the side.  They were fresh and cooked well, but why ruin good seafood by covering it up with sauce?  All fresh seafood needs is a little butter or olive oil and maybe some garlic.  Let the protein speak for itself.  Why hide it?  The sorbet between courses is again a nice touch and so too are the chocolate covered strawberries.    I like old style Vegas and I like downtown, but needless to say, I am not a fan of Hugo's Cellar.  If I want a steak downtown again, I'll head over to Vic & Anthony's at the Golden Nugget, where we had exemplary service and excellent food awhile back.  For a real hidden gem downtown, try the Second Street Grill hidden away at the Fremont or the Triple George Grill.  All three of these places are much nicer in my opinion than Hugo's....  Sadly, the menu and Hugo's is in my view, too \"old school\".  To much stuff you'd have expected in an episode from Mad Men rather than in 2013..  An addendum, I did put in our reservation this was our anniversary, and didn't even get a greeting of happy anniversary...to me that was really kind of a big no-no for a place that wants to be \"old school\"",

    "text": "Old school Vegas at its finest.   I've been coming to Hugo's since I was a teen. My dad worked in 4 Queens management and we were lucky to be comped here quite a few times. In those days though, I was vegetarian (Womp Womp).   I've developed a new love for Hugo's as a grown woman. My friends and I went for a birthday celebration. Upon entering the restaurant, all women are given a single red rose (classy). On this particular night, I ordered the filet de boeuf Atlantis. With the meal comes a table side prepared salad with pretty much every topping imaginable to choose from. Get the peppercorn ranch. You won't be disappointed. Back to the filet. Oh my. Filet mignon wrapped in bacon sitting on a bed of lumped crab. Does this really exist? Yes it does.   Try to save room for dessert. You must get something flombed. Preferably the bananas foster. It is just such a delight to have your dessert prepared table side and then set on fire!!  If you are really feeling hungry, I highly recommend the Hugo's hot rock for 2. Table side they bring slabs heated to 500 degrees smear them with garlic and then sear pieces of chicken, filet mignon, shrimp and tuna. It is served with 3 different sauces and is quite delightful.   Shout out to John the best sommelier in town and the V team Vincent and Victor who really understand old school Vegas class. Real Gentlemen and really great service.",

The prime rib was excellent, as was the salad. The sides to the meal -  not stellar. Additionally for so much staff, the attention to my table was lacking. I had asked my server to see a wine list for wines by the glass. He asked me what type of wine I was interested in, I said Cabernet and he said we only have one of those by the glass. When the sommelier brought the wine for me to taste, he told me he had a secondary Cabernet by the glass (strike one). After the meal was finished, the support person asked if we would like for coffee. But the main server did not come around and off for dessert - he only brought the bill. Lastly, this is the first restaurant including Denny's, we are one of the staff took the signed bill prior to us departing. All in all I will most likely not return to Hugos cellar.",

First of all, they seated us at the wrong table and asked us to move....  ok...... the bisque was dark colored and had no lobster in it...  tasted like a dirty skillet had been de-glazed with cream... the fish cakes were pure bread crumbs, fried with a crust... contained no fish... was very dry....  the salad was prepared at the table... with black PLASTIC utensils in a plastic bowl.... iceberg lettuce and sliced tomatoes....  (I make a hundred times better salads at home every day!)  ....the Wellington was horrible.... a paper thin pastry soaked in grease (should be a puffy pastry, dry) ...there was a filet in there... and some muchrooms...  should have a heavenly mushroom pate .....very unappealing.... I had cheesecake for dessert....  cheesecake is cheesecake....  my friend ordered Tiramisu.... it tasted like paste that 6 year olds made in school.....  the bill was $175.00.  The manager was at the door when we left, so I told him how much we didn't enjoy the food... he seemed angry and disinterested... would he have asked, \"What did you order?\" or SOMETHING???  !!!   I told him, \"I can see that you don't care, so good-night...\"    We ate GOOD FOOD later when we got home.",

    "text": "Oh Hugo!!!!  What can I say? Our time there was truly magical. My friends (3 of them) and I decided to make reservations to Hugo's Cellar on our most recent visit to Vegas. Upon arriving to our reso's, we were each given a long stem red rose. My heart immediately melted because really, who doesn't like flowers. We sat at a very nice table and had 4 waiters attend to each of us. It's like we each had our own waiter. We were given so many options, so many recommendations and so many choices. They explained to us that Hugo's was one of the last places that have continued their \"special service\" of table side salad, picking our own sides, and including dessert in our experience. We each ordered a dirty martini and not only was it delicious but it came out in the cutest container and crystal holder. (please see attached picture). It was like 4 martinis in one. My kind of drink! A nice gentleman came by and made our salad, asked each one of us what we wanted and what we didn't. It's tableside salad making in which you figure out how different you and your taste buds are than your friends. Haha! Of course, mine was the yummiest. After we finished the salad, we were give cutie patootie little tart sorbet ice-cream cones to clean our taste buds for our main dish. This was sooooooooo cool. I wonder why high end LA restaurants don't use this cool and cute tool. Anyhoo, My friend and I shared the Ribeye with crusted horseradish (16 ounces) YUMO! There is an additional $25 they charge for splitting your meal but it's soooooo worth it. They split it, everyone gets the same amount of sides (asparagus, rice, mashed potatoes). My other two friends split the Filet Mignon with crusted horseradish and theirs was just as delicious. Dessert came out a short time after. We got chocolate dipped strawberries, figs and chocolate dipped apricots with the MOST delicious whip cream you have ever tasted. Everything was so excellent. Service, service, food, service. They appreciated us as customers and we appreciated everything about them. The bill came and we were shocked! This time shocked because we didn't expect a place like this to be soooooooo reasonable. We love Hugo's Cellar and it's amazing staff. Keep up the great job.",

    "text": "So many other options in town for steak. This was just okay. The steak was good enough and priced as high as you would expect.  The part that irritated us was we went on our 20th wedding anniversary. Place was louder than expected but that wasn't too bad.  While they have a corkage fee ($20) what they don't bother to tell you is if you happen to bring a bottle they have on their wine list they refuse to open the bottle. Yup. Spend 70 dollars for a steak and they'll tell you no.  So essentially if we had brought a cheap bottle of grocery store wine they would have opened it but a quality bottle we brought the answer is a resounding \"no\".    Billed as an old school Vegas Steak house where in old Vegas no one was ever denied anything.   The other issue was we felt very rushed. Everything was fast paced and clearly set for turn over. Personally, when I spend this kind of money it's special and honestly for the money I like feeling like they're happy I'm there. Almost like I'm eating a lot a friend's place. They rushed the service, everyone was running around crazy, and I know it sounds odd to notice this but they handed us our salad plates. It struck me as odd in a high priced place - it's like okay I guess I'll pay for the privilege of serving myself. Not what I would expect or look for to be treated like a dollar amount more than a customer from a high end steak house.   The servers were nice enough and the food was good and there was a lot of it.  While it's been around a while and would have been a top notch steak house back then it's just average, over priced, rushed and has some off-putting customer policies I would say look elsewhere for a steak like Echo and Rigg or Herbs and Rye.",

He knows his stuff and pours an excellent manhattan (it comes in a carafe, so it's really two manhattans for the price of one!). The ambiance is all old school, and though you will feel wildly out of place in the casino all dressed up, it is appropriate for this steakhouse.   The only reservation we could get was 5:30 pm on a Saturday - make your reservations early! We started with the bread, which is assorted and very good. Their butter is like crack to me, so tray that too. My husband and I both got the salad made at the table. It was very good, but if I had paid $19 to have it as my entree, I would think it a little on the light side. My husband got the prime rib, which as massive, and I got the vegetarian option of the night. Oh my, was this a plate of awesomeness! Raviolis stuffed with portobello mushrooms, covered in a light pesto sauce, with yummy vegetables on he side. My husband could only eat half of the prime rib, but he enjoyed it.   Next time I would bring a change of clothes to better mix in with the crazies in downtown, it was quite a show but we didn't stay long because we were out of place being dressed up. The hotel itself is kind of gross, and we saw some really unsanitary things happen on the casino floor, so be prepared. Hugos is worth it though!",

The positive reviews are what made me make the reservation for my birthday dinner..  Vincent was our waiter and Carlos was his back waiter I believe. Both were very accommodating and enjoyable to talk to but not bothersome when my mother and I were talking and eating quietly.  The martinis are fantastic and for $18 I got 3 glasses of a makers mark manhattan. Score! My moms Riesling which she said was delicious was $6... what?!   The crab cakes were delicious but wish they were a tad bit larger and with more of the delicious sauce.. $19 was kind of steep, but they did have great flavor and full of grab, so plus there.   For dinner my mother and I did a split plate($26 to split but you each get a salad and the sides) dinner of the rack of lamb. First off, let's talk about the salad... wow! Table side preparation with all the fixings, was a meal in itself and so yummy! Couldn't finish though, gotta save room for lamb!    Now, we each got about 4 lamb bones, small side of potatoes and mixed vegetables. Lamb was cooked perfectly medium, but kind of difficult to cut between each bone. No worries, still tasted delicious with the Indonesian (peanut based) sauce.   To finish we got a variety of dipped chocolate apricots, strawberries and figs with fresh whipped cream. :-) and a free birthday lava cake. I was too full to finish but it was very good.  Now I recommend this place to most people but to be honest not kid friendly in my opinion or good for first dates. Yes the rose is a nice gesture to impress a lady on a first date but if the date isn't going well there's no music to draw out the silence lol   Hope my review helps! Have fun! Get a martini!",

    "text": "Me and my friend were planning a trip to Vegas and he told me from the beginning that we have to go here no matter what.  Turns out, we were staying at Four Queens Hotel in downtown Vegas where it is located so it was a perfect opportunity to try it out.  We made reservations and went there. Since it was only two of us, it was easier to reserve but if you have a party of 4 or more, it might be a little harder.  As soon as you entered this place, this place have a very unique kind if vibe like you are in a scene of godfather movie or something.  Once we got seated, we got menus and fresh bread. The bread was fresh and amazing.  The menu have variety of things but we both decided to do Steak with Crab legs and steak with lobster.  With every entree, they serve table side salad bar where you can create your own salad and assorted deserts in the end  After ordering, the table side salad bar came along. The host asked us what kind of things and condiments we want in our salad. They had a lot of options. The salad was amazing and it seem like everything was so fresh.  After finishing up with the salad, they server us mini raspberry sorbet ice cream cone, which was the best raspberry sorbet I had. The main purpose is to neutralize your taste buds so you can taste the meat better   After that, we were served steak, crab legs and lobster. Each one of them were marvellous.   After dinner, we were served with assorted desert on a tray which had chocolate covered apricots, strawberries and chocolates. They were awesome.  Overall, an amazing 5 star experience. From the host to server to food, everything was amazing.   We will definitely come here again the next time we are in Vegas.",

I have not been her for a few years but as we walked in we immediately recognized employees that have been there for years and years. The food is still great. the atmosphere is great. Just all around a cool place to go for a great night. I just spent my 35th anniversary there. Had a great dinner.  I watched a another couple that I overheard say it was there first time there.  I smiled as they wheeled the salad cart to there table and  the woman had fun making all the choices for her salad.  My wife and I enjoyed the bananas foster and the Kona coffee. I say it is worth the price for such an enjoyable evening. And afterwards you can walk it off around Freemont street and watch all the craziness! Don't hesitate. Just go for it!",

However considering the very high-priced items the food is barley mediocre. I make better meals at home. And what was really a let down is the bread that the put on the table. It's a combo basket of the bread you see at all the buffets around town. No hot steaming, fresh bread. The butter was cute in a rose formation but rock solid frozen. It's unfortunate you have to walk thru a very old, run-down, smoke riddled casino to get to the restaurant and if you have to go to the bathroom you have to do the same thing. So if you go here it's not to have a great meal, it's to enjoy and old Vegas idea, well at least in the cellar itself.",

    "text": "This steakhouse is located in the middle of Four Queens: close to the craps tables & down the stairs. No restrooms inside so you have to use the casino restrooms (exit the restaurant,  make a right, & follow the wall to the end). I called 2 weeks prior (no availability on OpenTable) & managed to grab the last reservation (for a party of 6) for the night we needed at 9PM, but was told to check-in 30min prior the reservation to see if we were able to get seated earlier. Upon check-in, we were immediately seated. Walking-in, not even half the restaurant was full so we thought it strange that there were no other reservations available when we tried to book. The decor is lush but in an old school steakhouse kind of way: Great for dates & celebrations. Note: Dress is at least business casual. Ladies are presented w/ a rose at the host stand, which I thought was a nice touch. After seating, the waiter explained that Hugo's is Old Vegas-style & went on to say sides and desserts were included with your entree.  *~Our Order~* on 5/13/2017 Dirty Martini ($13) Lychee Martini ($13) Old Fashion ($12) Escargot en Croute: ($18) 6pcs. Sauteed in shallots, garlic, burgundy wine, herbs topped w/ puff pastry Beef Wellington ($62) Filet of beef, topped w/ a duxelle of foie gras & mushrooms; baked in pastry & served w/ bordelaise sauce NY Strip ($52) Premium Black Angus beef (aged a min of 28 days), char-broiled to taste & served w/ mushroom ragout & bordelaise sauce. Add Shrimp Skewer (+$8) Tournedos: ($67) Two 5oz filets topped w/ foie gras, artichoke hearts & bearnaise sauce Hugo Rib Eye ($57) Premium Black Angus beef (aged a min of 28 days), char-broiled to taste & served w/ mushroom ragout & bordelaise sauce Prime Rib - Cellar Cut: ($55) 16oz.  Build-your-own-salad: Salad dressings - Peppercorn Ranch / Caesars / Honey Walnut Vinaigrette. Toppings - Bay Shrimp / Diced Egg / Artichoke Hearts & Palms / Roasted Pine Nuts / Feta Cheese / Tomatoes / Red Onion / Croutons / Mushrooms / Freshly grated Parmesan and/or black pepper  **Entrees include vegetable du jour & choice of roasted garlic whipped potatoes / red potatoes with parsley / wild rice  Hugo's is known for their martinis and their dirty martinis have a very strong olive taste (you get about 1.5 drinks). Beware: their Old Fashion is strong as well.  An assortment of complimentary breads & crackers are brought out w/ beautiful rose-shaped butter while you wait for your food. The escargots came out 1st which were topped by a delicious pastry puff. The escargots were buttery and tender but I prefer mine to have more garlic. The build-your-own salad that is served table-side was then brought out. Everyone LOVED their salad. My BF said he'd be ok with just the salad and no prime rib! Note: if you're usually a vinaigrette dressing person and want to go for the honey walnut vinaigrette, it is more honey than vinaigrette so it is on the sweet side (which isn't my preference). Then came out intermezzo: a pomegranate sorbet on the tiniest cone. Super cute palate cleanser!  Next came, the main event. I ordered the Tournedos. What surprised me the most about my dish was that the foie gras wasn't pate spooned on top of the filet mignon. I could see the whole duck liver on top of my filet! The foie gras wasn't as iron-tasting and was fairly light (but fatty). I ordered my filets to be cooked to a medium rare but they were still a bit chewy (so thought they were just OK). BF liked his prime rib but was so full from the bread and salad, he couldn't finish (had to take 2/3 of his plate home). Everyone else at the table also said they enjoyed their dishes.  For dessert, they bring out a platter of dipped fruit: dark chocolate covered strawberries, dark chocolate dried apricots, & white chocolate dried white figs. There's also a small bowl of whipped cream for dipping. Afterwards, they bring a platter of the desserts that they offer if you wanted additional sweets but we were way too full. They also ask if you would like coffee or any other after-dinner drinks. One person did ask for an affogato, but they said they don't serve it (even tho they offer espresso and ice cream.. oh well).  Service was great. During the whole meal, we had at least 2 waiters tending to us. When we raised our drinks, I added \"Happy Early Birthday!\" to my BF. At the end of the meal (and before they brought out the desserts), they brought out a bread-pudding with a candle in it. I guess someone took notice because I didn't mention it to any of the waiters. Talk about paying attention! In addition, even though they used the same jokes at each table (I could overhear since the restaurant is fairly quiet even with the casino upstairs), the waiter delivered them each time like it was their first.  Fairly good steaks in an unexpected part of downtown.  Note: Party of 6 is considered a large party and will automatically include a 18% gratuity.",

    "text": "Hugo's Cellar is almost like an \"out of body\" experience. You will not believe that something that classy and nice can be in a \"dive\" casino like the Four Queens on Fremont Street.  I enjoy the Fremont experience and have stayed at the Four Queens hotel, but Hugo's is just something else. Much has been said about the experience, but I would like to add the \"Hot Rock\" appetizer as a consideration for your next visit.  Pieces of beef Filet, swordfish, chicken and shrimp are cooked on a sizzling hot stone at your table. A Garlic paste is spead on the stone and you turn the meat enough times to meet your taste of \"done-ness\" and then you have a choice of Plum suace, hot mustard or Bernaise sauce to dip your morsal into.  Just outstanding !!!  and just enough to not interfere with your dinner. As for the salad prepared at your table, I suggest you get your salad favorites and then ask your tuxedoed server for a combination of the creamy pepper dressing and the vinegarette.  The combination of those two produces a dressing taste that is out of this world. The best salad I have ever eaten. Lastly, being the beef eater that I am, I will recommend the Swordfish ( did I really just say that ) with the Sauce Nantua - a combination of shrimp and crab.  Can it get better than this - I think not. Enjoy the end of your meal with the chocolate covered strawberrys, covered figs and covered apricots.  Walk back up the stairs into the Four Queens gaming area and ask yourself if just you got transported somewhere else for the past hour or two and then were deposited back rudely into this casino.",

We went last Friday April 29th and were very disappointed in the food and service. All four meals were delivered cold so we sent them back then they reheated them and it was well done when served the second time. We made the mistake of not complaining again and ate the meals, but should have sent them back and left. I suppose any place can have an off night, but it was very disappointing for Hugo's to have one. Hopefully something did not chance permanently, we will try it one more time.

Valet parking at the Four Queens is slow and frustrating, I suggest self parking in the garage. I've eaten here a handful of times, and the food seems to be getting worse and worse. Table side flambeed duckling was dry and overcooked to the point of inedibility, tasteless steamed baby vegetables, fatty and overcooked meat, marginally fresh seafood, and a raunchy table side salad course complete with frozen baby shrimp, wilted iceberg lettuce, and sickly sweet dressings. Service was fine, but nothing remarkable. The high points of this place are the knowledgeable and fun sommeliers, decent dessert cart, a palette cleanser sorbet course, and a cool ambiance if you can ignore the drunk tourists at the adjacent table.",

The veal was topped with king crab legs and smallish pieces of white asparagus, the veal was perfect but I was not crazy about their version of bearnaise sauce. It was like a gravy than a sauce. The prime rib was near perfect, not the best she ever had but close. salads and the huge side dishes had us too full for desert. Price was very reasonable as we got out for under $150.

    "text": "I was looking forward to trying Hugo's after having read many great reviews and hearing a lot about how this place really is exceptional. My husband and I went for a nice dinner to celebrate a very special occasion.  I do think they have great things to offer as far as the rose for the ladies, the large amounts of food for the money, and the old school Vegas atmosphere, if that's what you like.  The service was top notch with many attending to our every need.  BUT the mediocre food could not make up for all of the above. I ordered the Filet Boeuf, which is a bacon wrapped 10oz filet with lump crab meat. My husband ordered the NY strip.  His NY strip had great flavor and was a tad under cooked for medium but my filet was way undercooked. I've been to plenty of nice steak places and have ordered my filet medium. This place turned it out pretty much rare. The steak was very thick and did not have enough charring on the outside as usual and was raw.  The lump crab that the steak sat on, was mixed with what appeared to be a dry stuffing mixture and it was dry. I didn't care very much for the texture or flavor.  The green beans were cooked well but had no flavor and the mashed potato was firm. They scooped it with a ice cream scooper and it could have been a little softer.  The meal reminded me of when you attend a seminar or a mid price ranged wedding and they serve you mediocre food that is luke warm.  Although the price is great considering a table side hand tossed salad, all the veggies, bread, chocolate covered fruit tray, and bottled water are all included with the entree and not a la carte like most places, the value really isn't there if the steak isn't done right.  I don't know if it was a fluke with my steak having been undercooked but the overall meal left little desire for me to return for a second trip.",

    "text": "Old Vegas Old Vegas Old Vegas Old Vegas!  If I didn't already tell you, this is OLD VEGAS deluxe.  In the bowels of the 4 queens in downtown, a truly hidden gem for dinner.  Warm dark walls, booths and a menu reminiscent of \"the old days\".    Not sure if the building or staff have been there longer, but they are all top notch.  First, the wine Sommalier is a fine Englishman with a extremely broad wine knowledge and a very pleasant demeanor.  We eat here perhaps twice per year and he remembers our names and the wine we had last visit.  The evening focuses around the salad cart with over 15 different items  and three home made dressings tossed table side by Victor the salad master.  Thereafter there are the old time standards, rack of lamb, veal oscar, steak diane, etc.  I had the veal oscar with crab , white asparagus and a wine demiglace, it was tender and very good.  My wife had the salad and shrimp cocktail, she wasn't very hungry, it too was nice.  My mother rounded out with the swordfish simply grilled, tender and good.  We chose a very nice, and nicely priced ($65.00) Spanish Cabernet \"2003 Torres\" mas la planta.  You are served a berry sorbet in a mini waffle cone between courses and finish off with chocolate dipped strawberries  and figs.  Yes, we were stuffed but had the banana's flambe anyway.... a must.  Listen to me!!!  If you go to Vegas you MUST come here.  Forget charlie trotter, aureole etc.  Relax and take a trip back in time.  You'll thank me later.",

    "text": "Just got back from our first time at Hugo's! We have lived in Vegas for 10 years, and have always wanted to try it, so we decided to celebrate Valentine's Day a week early. We were a bit skeptical based on its location, but our fears were quicly calmed---great place!  We arrived a few minutes early, but were quickly seated...and just like previous posts indicate, I was given a long stemmed red rose upon entry. The ambiance is old school, dark steakhouse, but very romantic. We had the fabulous salad cart as our appetizer...I had caesar, and the hubby had a sweet walnut vinaigrette. Both were outstanding---shrimp, egg, croutons, peeled tomatoes, fresh mushrooms, and loads of parmesan cheese were at the ready. The cocktails were great---I had a martini that really was like having 3--one glass, then they gave me an individual carafe on ice to refill my glass as I needed. Bread basket had a nice variety of breads, but we were partial to the house special cheese lavosh--yummy! For entrees, the hubby had the 16 oz ribeye, cooked to perfection. I had the filet Atlantis--a succulent beef filet (huge!) bacon wrapped, served over lump crab meat with bernaise on the side. It was like butter! We enjoyed the chocolate dipped fruit tray, and also tried a chocolate almond cheesecake---so full! The coffee was excellent, and came with neat little goodies--cinnamon sticks, and chocolate mint swirl sticks.  We also had Anthony as our server--one of the very few True local Vegas people in town! He was very personable and professional... he had a great helper named Eric who was very attentive, and excellent at making sure we were happy all evening. What a great value for 2!!!! Our bill came to $144--that included 4 premium cocktails (grey goose and bacardi), coffee, salads for each of us, 2 desserts and 2 beef entrees with potatoes and veggies---4 premium beverages on the strip alone would be $50 bucks, the steaks would be at least $50 bucks each, plus salads at $12 bucks each, then desserts @ 9 dollars each, not to mention that each potato and veggie side would be  about $9 bucks a piece, then add the coffee..well over $220 bucks! We had a great experience, and will definitely return!!!",

Other party members ordered the Filet Mignon...I tasted it...it was good, not memorable. The tableside-made-to-order salad was pretty cool.  The guy shows up with a cart of fixin's and literally makes each persons salad, just the way they want it.  This is included with each meal (no extra charge). After dinner, they bring out some chocolate-dipped fruits.  This is also included at no extra charge. I'll give it 4 stars for now.  I need to try it again and it can go up to 5 stars, but it can also drop to 3 stars.  Maybe it stays at 4.",

The table side salad was good, but can't they use different bowls to mix when people get different dressings??? Had the scallops festival or something like that. It was good, but interesting. The scallops were cooked perfectly, but the sauce they were in was almost like a beef gravy. After a bite I just felt like I was eating a super tender steak covered in rich gravy. Kind of strange. But it was good. The chocolate dipped fruit plate they give for dessert was good too.",

They make your salad right at your table with plenty of items you can choose to top it with.

    "text": "It was a Friday and I had made reservations two days in advance.  The place was busy. Nonetheless, we only waited 10 minutes to be seated.  I received a long stemmed rose, like every other lady in the house.  Hugo's Cellar has a classic, vintage, old Las Vegas feel. Some patrons were dressed in coats while others were in shorts and flip flops.  The place is compact with a low ceiling and dim lights. Waiters have to squeeze the carts between table spaces.  I had lobster bisque for my starter while my husband feasted on the bread. The lobster bisque was ordinary, but I was not fazed; afterall, this place had stood the test of time in an ever changing Vegas restaurant scene.  People must come here for a reason.  We each had the Hugo's Table Side Salad. It was salad prepared by the salad master who comes around in a cart.  He was such an expert, but the busy house kind of made the whole making-the-salad-in-front-of-you experience feel rushed. The salads were good but, I would have loved some other kinds of greens apart from lettuce.  For the entrees we had the Atlantis (Filet de Boeuf) and the Rack of Lamb.  The filet was seasoned perfectly and perfectly cooked, medium, spot on with the desired doneness.  It was the most tender piece of meat I have ever had and believe me, I had been to many a good steak houses in town (Golden Steer, Ruth's Chris, Carnevino, The Steak House in Circus Circus to name a few).  It literally melted in my mouth. The Rack of Lamb was equally spot on.  I ordered medium well and it was cooked to how I wanted it done. This place, REALLY knows how to cook meat! The sides were very good too but were more like backup dancers to the stars of the entrees.  Some might say, that is how it should be.  For dessert we had the famous table side flambeed Bananas Fosters and a cappuccino.  Wow! Recalling my experience is making me hungry.   The wine was a memorable experience.  They have an extensive wine list but their Sommelier, Jon, was nice enough to recommend the last bottle of 2007 Paul Hobbs Cabernet in his possession.  Mind you, this wine was not on the wine list, and it was flattering to be in on this little secret. The wine complemented the entrees very well.    The only thing that bothered me throughout the whole experience was the heat in the cellar.  It was hot down there! Perhaps it was because of the number of patrons in addition to table side cooking.    While this place is pricey, there are reasons to justify the costs. All the portions of meals, including the dessert and cappuccino were HUGE!  I do appreciate the complementary bottled water, the freshly baked breads, the sorbet to cleanse the palette and the chocolate dipped strawberries, apricot and figs.  Hugo's Cellar is a survivor for a several reasons. Their service, how they treat their meat, their wine list, how they embrace the classics (like giving roses to the ladies and keeping a good menu) are all note worthy. Overall, it was a wonderful dining experience.  I do see myself coming back on a non weekend, just to see how things are.",

The food...well...   Lobster bisque was very good.  Then it went downhill.  I ordered my meat medium,  and my husband ordered his rare.  Mine came back extremely rare, while his was literally cold.  Both dishes were sent back. They gave me a whole new steak, which was again, very rare. And instead of truly heating up my husband's steak, they simply placed the entire plate back under the heat lamp. So the plate came back hot, while the steak was still cold.  Just very disappointing for a place that is supposed to specialize in this kind of thing.  My husband did not want to make a big deal, so he just didn't eat the dish and asked for them not to charge us.  They didn't...so to speak.  They ended up charging us 15 dollars for the salad he ate beforehand.  Come on.  15 dollars.    Atmosphere was great.  Steak- no way.  Two dishes screwed up? I'd rather not take the chance to try again and just go somehwere tried and True.",

Well Hugo's is the complete opposite of that!  However in this case I just love the old school Vegas feel of the joint.  Low ceilings, brink walls, dim lights...don't care...love it!  Food is really good, not \"Celebrity chef\" great.  I am always comped so value is hard to put a finger on.  All meals come with a made at table salad and with sides included, plus a small dessert at the end.  The size of the meals means that starters or extra desserts are really not needed.  So for $35 to $50 you really get a complete meal.  Based on that I would say value was good.  LOVE the prime rib, bone in strip, rack of lamb and King crab legs.  Other seafood dishes are solid if a little under whelming, all the steaks are prime and it shows.  Made to order salad is great and a mini meal in itself.  Special shout out to the Sommelier from England who is just so friendly and very funny.  Tell him what you like and he will find a great bottle for you.  He always has a bottle of Kim Crawford out that back for us.  Love it!",

    "text": "I had been to Hugo's Cellar before and it was delicious, but last night left a lot to be desired! I enjoy food, and sometimes the sweet and savory dishes I am craving are not offered in the same place. So, last night, I was excited to eat Hugo's heavenly Banana's Foster after my meal. I had talked up this dessert and this restaurant to my girlfriend, and she was excited to see what all the fuss was about. We drove across town specifically to come to Hugo's Cellar and enjoy some wine and dessert. However, after being seated and taking our order, a manager-looking guy comes over saying that they do not serve dessert only and that we had to either order an appetizer or go find room at the bar... um... ok... I brushed it off and said \"oh no problem, we'll order an appetizer.\" After we ordering our appetizer, they come over with the Banana's Foster. Confused, I ask \"is that for us?\" and the server says \"yes.\" But you guys made us order an appetizer???? The server says \"Oh you wanted the appetizer first?\" (really???), ok so he takes back the dessert and brings out the appetizer. We're not even done eating the appetizer when another guy comes over asking if he can take it away. I let him know that I am still working on it. They just keep making us feel uncomfortable. We felt rushed. As far as I could tell there was no one waiting to be seated, plenty of empty tables, what's the rush???  I mean it's not like we came for the free bread! We ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer (THAT YOU FORCED ON US), and dessert... what the hell??? When we finally get our dessert, we are not even two bites into it when they bring the check and return back trying to cash us out. Are you serious??? At that point we were just like \"ok, we get it, you're trying to get rid of us, here's our card.\" It's not even like the restaurant was full! It's ok if you don't want clients coming to just get dessert, that's fine. But man, they could have handled that much better! I was mortified that I talked my friend into coming to eat here, and then get treated this way. There are many places to get a great meal in Vegas, ones that don't require walking through a seedy area of town, to pay big bucks, and be treated badly.",

After this glorious beginning it got worse. I've been going to Hugo's for years and loved it. My previous reviews have been sparkling. We generally bring our own wine and because they carry the brand there is a $25 corkage charge. I have never paid that charge but reflect the non-charge in the Sommelier's tip. Both the Sommelier and the mgr. assured me there would be no corkage charge. There was a charge. No problem, the Sommelier paid for it. Next was the salad;a great salad served at your choice of ingredients at the table. This was the meal's highlight. The server was pleasant and good and the salad perfect. We ordered the Beef Wellington and lobster tails. The tails were $90 but Australian tails are hard to find. No chef needed here, tails were great. The Wellington meat was perfect but the liver crust was shoddy and almost liver free. That never happened before. However, over all the food was very good. The waiter was ridiculously silly and lazy. Kept muttering something about serving ladies first. We had ordered the 2 dishes to share and explicitly requested the beef be cut at the table so my wife could get the better-done ends. We attempted to get the vegetables we wanted not the melange they wished to serve. This waiter refused to do that; a first at a \"fine restaurant\".  The meal was not split, nor the meat carved at table. Like the vegetables I gave up the meat carving but insisted the meal be shared in the kitchen. A very unappetizing dinner was had. Oh,there has always been a 20% discount available through the casino which owns the place or at the 2 for stands in town for a small fee. Well they reduced it unilaterally to 20% on one entree. I am only upset at the people who have, in the past, gone here because of my reviews.  This place is now only for people with low to no self esteem, masochists and really ignorant tourists. My hope is that this review will cost at least as much business as the good ones I have given. Oh! I tipped what I was given. Zilch. I wish more people would assert themselves. It still cost close to $200 for a miserable dinner.  A note. Hugo's cancelled my reservation after I had been there. It took a while to figure out why. Turns out that if one has not been at the restaurant one can not review that restaurant on Open  Table. That is a problem that Open Table should fix in my view. However, Trip Advisor is a much better place to review a restaurant. I can not believe the pettiness this place, Hugo's, resorts to cover up some thing that never should have happened.",

Quiet, romantic, quaint and classy. The menu is fix prixe so the price, which seem pretty high, includes an excellent salad, some sort of potato, a vegetable and a light dessert. Great service, interesting menu and a martini served like I've never seen with so much gin (real martinis aren't made with vodka!) that I couldn't finish it. Our waiter had been there for 17 years! Highly recommended. Didn't see their wine list, but suspect it was classy. sdm",

    "text": "I was born and raised in Las Vegas. I have been coming to Hugo's since I was a kid. I went to homecomings and proms here. Birthdays and other celebrations as well. Anytime a friend from out of town asked for a suggestion on a good quality steakhouse Hugo's was my first thought. I've been to every fine dining restaurant Las Vegas has to offer and still regarded Hugo's as my favorite. So you would see my great GREAT disappointment with my experience tonight. It's my birthday. My fiance made a reservation for us and was very excited to try my \"favorite spot\". It was his first time and will be his last. Our waiter came up to our table with a miserable look on his face right off the bat. Did not introduce himself, did not ask what the occasion was (although we told the host it was my birthday, twice) he asked for our drinks and rushed off. Almost 15 minutes later he finally checked back with us to ask if we were ready to order. I am in the service industry and I am very sympathetic to waiters and service. I always give the benefit of the doubt to them when it takes a bit longer due to volume or short staffing. This was not the case. I saw him standing around, catering to other tables and didn't so much as look at us. A thumbs up at that point would have sufficed. We finally ordered appetizers and entrees. As I was about to ask about the table side salad he ran off like we were a bother. My fiance then excused himself to the \"bathroom\" but unbeknownst to me he actually went back to the host stand to make sure they could send a little cake out with a candle for my birthday. The host said \"absolutely\". I tried to wave down our waiter to ask a question, he made eye contact and ran away to the back. Our appetizers came first. We were not checked on once by the water until the table side salad (which should have been before the appetizers) were served. Again in a rushed and rude tone. Eggs? Red onion? Dressing? And everything was hurriedly thrown in a bowl and slopped onto our plates. A LONG while later our entrees came out. Both ordered medium. The couple next to us were given great and personable service and their salads were done before ours even tho they were seated well well after we had initially arrived. When we were finished with our salad plates we put them to the front of the table, our waiter walked by THREE times seeing the plates and just left them. Finally a busser picked them up 5 minutes later. I am 31 and my fiance is 29. We look younger and we pretty much chalked it up to age discrimination as we are extremely polite to servers everywhere we go. The Beef Wellington was disappointing and the Rack of Lamb was lack luster. Garlic mash had zero flavor. The food was the least of our grievances though because the service was so bad and impersonal. Usually you have two waiters helping you out. We saw the other waiter maybe twice and he was very polite. His name was Dave and we wish he would have been around more often. The bill came right after the chocolate covered strawberries. No birthday cake, no candle nothing special for my birthday even tho we told the host twice. 200 dollars later and my fiance was really upset. Hugo's Cellar is no longer my favorite restaurant. I will never suggest it again. I work in the number one nightclub in the world and have suggested it many times. Never again. My fiance refuses to come back. In all of my times coming to Hugo's in the past 25 years. (Yes 25 years!!!!) I have always had a pleasant experience and although one bad experience shouldn't ruin it for me, it has. My birthday dinner was not special. I would name the waiter in the review but he never once told us his name and we were too frustrated and upset to ask. We just wanted to get out of there. Go to Mastro's or Del Frisco's their quality of food and service are MUCH better. Maybe this is an end of an era. Very sad.",

When we first walked in to meet our group, I was immediately reprimanded by the host to keep the walk way clear. I get it, but I hadn't even gotten to the bar seat yet, when I was rudely told to move it. The bartender was the ONLY one in the place with any personality. Great at mixing drinks and friendly. Dean was awesome, I wish he could have been our server too! On to the server... Quirky at best. Not really personable. Took our order and that was that. The Sommelier was informative and friendly, I think we saw him more than we saw our server.  The food was good. Mixed reviews from our group. Mine was fantastic. I got the filet wrapped with bacon and crab. Sides of veggies were unusual. They took our plates very quickly, like they were trying to push us out. We had plenty for leftovers, but they took our plates and did not give us a chance to request boxes.    We ended with the bananas foster. Eh. Usually it's a presentation, but that left a lot to be desired.  Overall, the food was great. And besides Dean, our bartender, service was shockingly impersonal and a bit rude.  When I spend that much money on dinner, I love connecting with the staff, it makes the experience a lot more fun, and worth the money. This place just didn't do it for me.",

As soon as you walk in you are greeted by someone who hands you a rose (as long as you have b00bies) and then you are taken to your table. The ambience is wonderful. The place is dimly lit and everyone is dressed up in suits.   The waiters are all very friendly, although that could be because I was about 60 years younger than anyone else in the place....and I'm not exaggerating.   Apparently, they specialize in martinis. I didn't have one. I'm just putting it out there :)  Anyways, the salads are awesome! There is a salad cart that comes to your table and your salad is completely customized. I can't recall all the options but here are a few: bay shrimp, egg, bleu cheese crumbles, croutons, onion, tomato, and pine nuts. As for dressings they offer caesar, pepper ranch, and a really good honey something rather vinaigrette (which I opted for). Not something I usually go for but I'm glad I did. It was delicious!   To start with, I had the shrimp cocktail, 3 jumbo shrimp with cocktail sauce and a super yummy remoulade. That really made the dish!  In between the appetizers and meals, they bring over a tiny scoop of lemon sorbet on a mini cone to clease your palette. I have never been to a place that did this before but I thoroughly enjoyed it!  I also got prime rib, prepared medium rare. It was very good. You can also get them crusted with bleu cheese or horseradish, which I accidentally forgot to ask for :(  To top the meal off, the include chocolate covered strawberries, apricots, and figs. Really special touch.  I loved it here! The ambiance was really amazing and it is definitely a place to go if you are celebrating something special! Be prepared to spend some coin though. Really worth it",

One star knocked off only because it says there's a dress code but people came in with shorts, etc. I would have not worn fancy pants and wore my lucky shorts into the restaurant if I knew a dress code won't be necessary.   On important news: food- the escargot and crab cakes were great as well as the bread was filling. Escargot had only 6 pieces. Crab cake 2 pieces.  I was ready for my entree  (2 filet mignon with foie gras). But to my surprise they gave a pallet cleanser of yummy sorbet in a cone. *i thought that was cool.  Unfortunately yet fortunately surprise! A salad bar swings by and gives you a HUGE yummy salad (that's why there's a huge green plate on your table)....I wasn't expecting such a huge salad.  My stomach was filled to the brim with salad and i didn't have enough space for the entree as well as dessert? What the?  Chocolate dipped strawberries, figs, and apricots...as well as cream? *all complimentary  Food overload. Delicious but wow!  Also prior to dessert they show you a tray of desserts  Be warned  that was delicious but not part of your meal so it'll cost more....but the creme Brulee was tasty.  Why Hugo? Why did you pounce the salad bar on me!?  Entree unfortunately had a small sliver of dry foie gras (2 inches width and maybe 1/4 an inch of height) on top of the filet mignon.... so i would pass on that entree next time. Personally i do like a decent sized buttery melt in your mouth foie gras for the price. 60 bucks. *I've had fist sized foie gras or all you can eat foie gras for the same price at some restaurants. No joke. If on the menu...make it a decent size and don't skimp on it. Salad was deliciously huge....why not the entrees foie gras? *prior to the meal, I asked the waiter about the size of foie gras and he shaped it like a baseball size but it was more like a pog size (a half dollar coin size) Remember them pog toys?  My bro had rib eye and that was huge and delicious.  Overall. Great place. Pricy but good for special occasions. Eat less of the salad and bread so you have more room for the entree.Also takeout box is fancy and tasty food.",

The maitre d' was so nice and funny, and gave me a lovely rose. I was a little nervous because I never go to fancy restaurants and am not really used to the austere demeanor of our head waiter--he was very nice, just more formal than I'm used to. One thing I did appreciate was how he wasn't pushy with drinks. My husband and I don't drink, and I always feel awkward and bad when servers push bar drinks on me, but he was great in that regard. We ordered the ribeye and salmon which both came with the AMAZING tableside salad. Now the guy who came to make the salad was so much more my type of server :) He wasn't unprofessional for an upscale restaurant at all, but he cracked jokes and made me feel a lot more at ease (I wish I could remember his name--he was originally from Houston, so if the salad guy from Houston sees this, you were great!) The salads were so good and filling that I actually ended up taking most of my salmon back to the hotel, but it was amazing. I'd had salmon twice in the prior two days, so I was feeling a little salmoned out, but it was prepared so well that I really enjoyed it. Overall a great meal and experience!",

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! DEFINITELY RETURNING! :) LADIES GET A ROSE WHEN YOU WALK IN AND THEY PUT IT IN A VASE AT YOUR TABLE AND PACK IT TO TAKE HOME. HAPPY COUPLES DATE NIGHT :)",

    "text": "When folks come to Vegas I believe what they seek is an experience.   Whether it's a show, their hotel, the casino, people watching or the food.  Hugo's Cellar excels for a food experience!  The ambience is what I imagine was typical for old-school Vegas, a place for regulars with, ahem, \"connections\".  The wait staff is attentive and professional without being in the way.  Carlos is a fine waiter and Diego kept our water glasses full.  Then there was Victor.  At Hugo's they make each diner a salad to their specifications from a table side salad station.  Victor was the salad guy.  But he was so much more.  Victor was the story guy, and the \"tell it like it was\" guy, and the guy who embodied the ambience of Hugo's.  The name over the door read \"Hugo's Cellar\", but it could have easily read \"Victor's Place\".  Our party of 8 dined for close to 3 hours.  Mine and my wife's bill was around $170 for two entree and two martinis.  Expensive? You might think so.  You could think of it as comparable to two tickets to a Vegas show with a free steak meal.  I think of it as a Vegas experience and well worth it.",

We love to get a martini, which is served along with the remainder in an small, individual ice bucket! Yes, the prices at first are daunting, but as other reviewers have noted, it includes an awesome salad, prepared table side. My husband had Chilean sea bass, and I had the seafood trio (sea bass, crab cake, and shrimp scampi). Both came with potatoes and vegetables. Oh yes, and a sorbet to cleanse your palate between the salad and entree. Included were chocolate covered fruits (strawberries, apricots, and figs) for dessert. We would like to again thank Michael, our server, for a wonderful evening! Can't wait to go back!!",

    "text": "We stayed downtown for a birthday celebration and decided to venture out to find a location for dinner.  It was a Friday night and checked open table and thought we would check Hugo's.  Fortunately, they had a no-show for a reservation (reservations are HIGHLY encouraged!) so they were able to squeeze us in.  We waited in the lounge while our table opened up and met one of the most amazing bartenders - we ordered a Side Car (made his way) and Harvey Wallbanger, which were both fantastic.  They also had some very nice \"munchies\" at the bar.  I would definitely return to their lounge just for drinks.  Dinner was fantastic!  They have a very classic menu with amazing service.  Every single person who came to our table was friendly and well versed.  Our Sommelier was quite entertaining and we invited him back to join us for a toast.  The freshly tossed salad was impeccable.  We considered ordering dessert, but were so stuffed especially with the delightful little treats served at the end of the meal.  My only \"complaint\" was that some of the clientele did not dress appropriately for the venue (as noted in other reviews).  Downtown Las Vegas has come a long way with some great new options, and this one has remained True to its origins with service and quality befitting the heydays of Las Vegas.  This is a True gem that I had heard about for years and am glad we made it there to enjoy.  I will definitely return again and recommend it without hesitation for a special evening.",

Everything was timed very well so as not to over crowd the table or defer interest. Sommelier was very helpful and informative of the wine list and pairings.

Located in The Queen casino, you walk into a candlelit cave of old school class. The staff is friendly and professional.  Second, the intangibles of Hugo's are fantastic. Each entree comes with a made to order salad prepared at your table-side that was surprisingly filling and delicious. Between courses they provide you with a sorbet palate cleanser.   The reason I couldn't give a review higher than three stars is due to the steak quality. I had the ribeye and the gf had the filet mignon: both were okay but not great. Better than a chain restaurant but no where near the quality you would expect from $50+ steaks. This is unfortunate because everything else was done so well but they failed to stick the landing where it matters most.   Bottom line: loved everything except for our entrees. If you're going to try Hugo's, be prepared to be charmed and order something else besides the steaks.",

    "text": "I just first want to say that this is not the type of review I thought I would write for HC because I have enjoyed it in the past but that was a long time ago so I have to treat my current experience separately. I also understand that It was getting close to closing so we get that the staff may be tired or not on their game.   My big pet peeve is the hostess staring at you like she has no idea why you are coming towards her. If I ran a restaurant the hostess would lead the conversation not wait for you to inform her that you are there to eat at her restaurant. They presented my Wife with a rose which was a nice touch but the stem looked as if it came from a corn field. A little cut would have been better. We felt we had a sunflowers towering over us the whole time.   We were seated and met with a couple different staff members who all tried to get us to buy alcohol and then had a look of disappointment when we declined as we always do.   After a longer than I would have liked wait, we were asked to give our order. I have a Strip Steak and my Wife the prime rib. Before hand they brought out a salad bar and made our salad's before us which was nice. Everything was fresh and was well prepared.   Then they presented us with what can only be described as a tart, raspberry sorbet.  This was a pallet cleaner, I decided to leave mine dirty after one bite.   Our steaks finally came out and the first thing we noticed is how hot they were. I've been to enough steak houses to know that it was an abnormal temperature. We wondered if they had put it in a microwave. Pure speculation. Though the steaks in general were good but my strip steak was just a little tough in the initial cut.   We declined dessert and handed the waiter our CC to pay. It must have taken him 10 minutes to come back. Again too long and he took my ID with him. I just feel like when you're running a business there should always be someone there to take the money.   Anyway, a three for me. No Lawry's that's for sure. That place knows how to run a restaurant. I wanted to give it a four but too many details overlooked.",

    "text": "Ours was a party of six, a very special surprise Birthday celebration.  I hadn't been to Hugo's in over 20 years, and didn't remember much about the restaurant. The service was wonderful from the moment we entered.  As others have mentioned, the ladies I the group were greeted with a long stem rose. Service was prompt and very good.  I think every employee at Hugo's stopped by the table to wish our birthday guest a happy b-day.  Nice.  Food was served in a timely manner, and was great (except the tough, stringy, white asparagus-no one liked it).  A small pyramid shaped mousse cake was presented to the Birthday guest, along with the dipped fruit dessert.  Very nice!  Everyone had more than enough food, and left very satisfied.  The ONLY hitch was after we had left the restaurant, and went to pick up our car in Valet.  We took our validated ticket to where we had dropped the car off.  After standing, being ignored, for way too long, I hailed the valet (Lamont).  He barked \"you're in the WRONG PLACE\".  He said we needed to take the ticket to a window half way across the property!  I am disabled, and had walked about as far as I could - and explained this to him.  He said that \"that was where I had to go if I wanted my car\".  He said, very sarcastically, that if I \"couldn't possibly\" walk there, that my guest would have to schlep the ticket there, and ask them to bring the car to 'this side'.   I was totally embarrassed!  The Birthday guest saw my anguish, and she offered to go turn the ticket in for me.  She returned, some 5-10 min later, and we bagan the wait.  Nearly 15 minutes later valet, Lamont, walked by and said that our car is sitting at Valet - across the building.  I made the painful trek with the help of my guest.  More embarrassment!  I was nearly in tears from the pain by the time we got to the other Valet area.  Needless to say, my evening was ruined! NONE of this should have happened.  I had gone thru the trouble of visiting the valet area, and walking to Hugo's, then back to valet, some 5 hours earlier.  Knowing that I can only walk a short distance, I wanted to make sure that I would be able to make the walk.  I didn't want my disability to interfere with the other guests enjoyment in any way.  Instead, I was made into a gimp spectacle.   I doubt that we will EVER return for more abuse!",

The food is typical american steack house with some added value: the free giant salad (we had the Caesar sauce... there is anchovy flavour in it...

    "text": "In my opinion there are much better steakhouses here in Las Vegas, maybe not for the price for quantity aspect, but at least for the quality of their steaks.  I went here on the recommendation of a long time family friend, and I failed to find all the great things he told me about.  The service was fine, but nothing spectacular.  The steak was cooked properly but to me lacked the flavor or of high quality steak.  The salad they make for you at the table was nice, but again, nothing special.  I'll be honest in that I felt that the sides that came with my steak were better and more flavorful than the steak itself.  The highlight of the meal tonight was their sommelier, a Mr. John Simmons.  I told him what type of wines I like, what I was having for dinner, and then he suggested a price range and went to find a nice bottle for me and my cousin.  His choice was from a winery in Sonoma, CA that I had never heard of, and the price for the bottle was at the lower end of the suggested range, a pleasant surprise.  He also seemed to have the most personality amongst all the servers waiting on the table.  On the whole, if you want a romantic date spot, you can do worse than this place, where they do give roses to all the ladies that come in.  It can be rather intimate, and is quiet enough that you can have a nice conversation without having to shout.  In the end, I seriously doubt I will be coming back here as there are several other steakhouses in Vegas that I prefer.",

I mean, I was given a rose when I walked in the door AND a custom salad was made for each person in my group, in front of us, at the table. That calls for some major lovin'.   This place is old school classy and I loved it. Ignore the fact that it's in the Four Queens and GO, now. (If you have some cash to drop, that is...) It looks like a Cellar that your Dad or Grandpa might frequent, all brick and leather chairs and green glass chandeliers. But Oh, the food. Oh yes. And the wine! They have an on-site sommelier and he has personality to spare. Loved him.   Starts out with a salad that is custom made off a cart for you at your table. I recommend the Orange Vinaigrette, it was blow-your-mind good. I ate my whole salad, even though I knew a ton more food was coming, it was that amazing. And you can have it made really simple, or do like my guy did and get the works...which includes anchovies, hearts of palm, pine nuts, red onion, etc. Then you get a little mini raspberry sorbet to clear your palette. It worked! I had an amazing chicken and mushroom dish, but also know that the scallops and filet mignon come highly recommended by my foodie friends. After all of the moaning and giving each other bites of the deliciousness, you are treated to freaking chocolate dipped strawberries and figs with creme fraiche. (it's an all inclusive price.)   My friends had been there before and raved about the Bananas Foster. Now I see why. This guy in a Tux stands at your table and makes an AMAZING Bananas Foster, we are talking flames rising and the whole shebang. So delectable, I had said I would have a bite but ended up having like 5. And I double licked the spoon.   If you are looking for a True experience type restaurant, this is your place. I truly enjoyed myself here and will definitely go again.   I want to go to there!",

The things like the rose upon arrival, the salad cart and the deserts that all come at no extra cost are very nice touches. The martinis essentially come as 2 martinis, and the escargot was also very good. The food our party of 6 ordered was all very good. If you find yourself downtown, I'd recomend this place!",

Pricing is very expensive but there is a lot of service. Being located under the casino main floor may effect the clientele. We had a intoxicated dip sh#t that was loud and distracting. Almost had a confrontation except my sweet girl asked me not to engage. That was the biggest distraction from the good food and service. Excellent Martinis and cocktails. The hot stone appetizer was excellent! Salad is a great experience and delicious. My steak was a bit tough on the outside but tender once I got inside. My girls scallops were good. It was a great dining experience but expensive. I give it a three because of the price.. Food is 4 plus..",

We arrived without a reservation and were able to accommodate us immediately. The maitre d' handed the ladies in our party a long stemmed rose and treated us like royalty. Our server, I believe his name was Anthony, was a True professional. He got us all excited about the meal we were about to experience.   Our meal was something that we are still talking about.  it began with cocktails and a salad server arrived with a basket of fresh breads and built our salads tableside. We had over a dozen toppings to choose from and several dressings....so good!  After the salad we were served a mini sorbet to cleanse the pallet. I think mine was raspberry and it was so ideal after eating the anchovies in the salad.  Jason and I ordered the Chateaubriand for two and lobster tails. it was served with baby new potatoes and fresh spring vegetables. Our chateau was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. It burst with so much flavor that it made us both pause and look at each other with the look of satisfaction, kinda like the look you have after some really good circus style sex.   Our friends ordered the rib eye and they were completely amazed with it! We all said over and over how that meal was the absolute best meal we had all ever had.  We thought our dinner was over. But, to our surprise \"Anthony came over with an assortment of chocolate dipped fruits (strawberries, figs & apricots) and REAL whipped creme, and the dessert tray. We ordered two desserts from the tray and they were both served with REAL whipped creme and were TO DIE FOR!  During dinner we were talking about how we could just feel how good the coffee was going to be and sure enough. The coffee was so yummy!  The service was IMPECCABLE! We did not want for anything. Several times we commented on how we had NEVER had service like this EVER before, EVER! We felt as if we were waited on hand and foot! Our drinks were never neglected and we did not have to look for our server once. He was there every time we needed him and was not intrusive at all.   We are going to back to Vegas just to eat here again!  Bravo Hugo's Cellar!",

The tabe side salad service and the chocolate dipped strawberry & fig desert was perfect. The prices were a little high, however the dishes came with salad, sorbet, small sides, main course and petit fours. The atmosphere reminded my parents of the old days ~ cozy & quaint, the only thing missing was the \"Rat Pack\". I must say, we were so pleased to find this gem in a downtown casino restaurant. The only other thing I would say is make reservations!   I am so glad I found Hugo's Cellar on Yelp!",

Judging by the number of reviews, Hugo's is not a hidden location any longer.  Even though reservations are not required, it is helpful to ensure you get a table during the peak dining hours.  What are those in Vegas?  Between now and then...  There have been times that we messed up and didn't call ahead, and we waited.  Then, other times, we were seated right away.  It's Vegas and all about the gamble, right?  The rose upon entry for the ladies is such a nice feature.  Late in the evening when you walk around downtown, it's interesting to count how many roses there are floating around.  That Hugo guy must have been a huge romantic!  Probably has a lot of children as well.  (wink wink)  The food at Hugo's has yet to disappoint.  From the salad cart where you get to pick what goes into your salad, to the entree's served fresh and hot, to the complimentary chocolate-covered fruit.  All of this luxury, and a wine list to make any oenophile happy with the varied choices.  Stuck on which wine to choose? Help is what the sommelier loves to offer.  They are easy to spot because they have the gold medal hanging from their neck.  Just kidding, it's a tastevin used to sample before your first taste to ensure the wine is proper to be served.  Another nice touch.  For mixed drink fans, the bar makes solid drinks, not shy on flavor or punch.  This is a place where it is perfect to dress to impress.  One of the nicest restaurants in town, you want to look sharp.  We just wish they would bring back the original Hugo's chicken.",

    "text": "I heard about Hugo's Cellar through an email from TripAdvisor titled \"15 hidden gems\" which described attractions/restaurants around the world that weren't well known, but worth a visit. After a little more research I discovered that reviews on Hugo's were stellar. However, I can't say that I completely agree. To start, Hugo's is definitely \"hidden\" as it is tucked away under the Four Queens Casino in Old Las Vegas. (Old Las Vegas is worth the trip if you haven't been but expect a $30 can ride from the \"strip\")  Walking down the stairs into the restaurant definitely transforms you into a different world away from the crowd, noise and hustle of Vegas. There was no blaring music or flashing lights to disturb your meal. The cellar-like atmosphere with brick walls and dim lighting created a comfortable dining atmosphere. The well dressed clientele was a plus too - a very civilized meal compared to many Vegas restaurants which are sprinkled with the occasional obnoxious dinner guests. The service was some of the best I received in Vegas: friendly, attentive and knowledgable staff not just looking for an \"up-sell\". Thesommelier ,in particular, recommended a wine that wasn't on the menu, but exactly what we were looking and reasonably priced.  Based on the atmosphere and service, Hugo's Cellar is absolutely a hidden gem in Las Vegas. The food, however, was nothing to brag about. I had pretty high expectations based on some of the reviews I read.  We started with the escargot which was overpowered by garlic and topped with a random puff pastry - quite tasty if you're a garlic fan but disappointing for those who actually enjoy escargot. It's basically escargot for those whole don't actually like the taste. Next was the famed \"table-side salad\". A novelty idea that brought fun and personalization to the meal, but honestly was limp romaine lettuce with mediocre toppings. More exotic lettuce choices would have been a plus. The tomatoes were mushy and lacked much flavor. I was a big fan of the pine nuts though! Fresher ingredients are necessary all around. For the main course we shared the stuffed jumbo shrimp and the Tournedos Hugo (two five oz filets topped with foie gras and artichoke hearts). The shrimp were small (far from jumbo) and dry. The stuffing was bland and was overpowered by breadcrumb instead of crab that the menu boasted. The filets were mediocre. The fois gras was something you'd find in a can and I didn't see any artichoke hearts on the plate. I figured this dish would be extra special since it bears the restaurant's name; guess not. A free dessert of chocolate covered strawberries, figs as apricots with fresh whipped cream was included. We also tried the creme brulee which was just average. Bottom line: if you're in the area and looking to escape the Vegas atmosphere for a few hours you should consider trying out Hugo's Cellar (but not if you're on a budget). Otherwise it is not worth the trip to Old Las Vegas.",

That is why 2 stars.Dining should be an experience, not eat and run. With so many new places that make Hugo's Cellar look like a old Denny's. I understand the food is inexpensive for all you get, salad, main dish, starch and vegetable, bread basket, chocolate covered strawberries and coffee for one price. If you live in LV ok, but if your in Vegas for a dining experience try Wolfgang Punk -The Cut it's at the Palazzo . Comme-CA at the Cosmopolitan or Jean Georges Steakhouse at Aria. They are beautiful. The Fluers at Caesars is so beautiful you leave relaxed and happy.",

Upon arrival, all females are handed a beautiful long stem rose, then guided inside the restaurant which had an darker intimate/romantic setting. We then were presented with 2 types of bread, heart-shaped crackers and rose-shaped butter. We picked an appetizer, entrees (prime rib and NY strip) which included a custom made salad, our main entree and complimentary dessert (2 choc covered strawberry, 2 white choc fig and 2 choc dipped apricot). We were given this cute little raspberry ice cream cone to clean our palette before our main course. In additional to this, we received a chocolate molten cake a la mode with gorgeous artistic writing that said \"Happy Anniversary\". I could go on and on! Don't forget to check out the booth where Frank Sinatra used to hang out. If it's good enough for him, it's good enough for all of us!  HIDDEN freakin GEM!!!!!

The plates are about $48 and up but the serving is big & comes with salad.. Served table side. The servers are first class. I split my meal with my friend, we ordered a 16 oz ny steak and all of my other friends did the same. They charged us all extra fr the salad because we did not explain that we split that too, although they split the steak automatically. They removed it from the bill though so its all good.  The place is cozy but the price is quite high, I've been to other steakhouses that are around the same price but the ambiance is better & they do more table side services plus it comes with more stuff. Overall, the steak was good.. I ordered the NY steak.",

    "text": "I can't tell you how disappointed I am that I have to give Hugo's Cellar only 3 stars.. I had heard such great things, I'd read so many of the raving reviews and I just couldn't wait to go there. The bf and I went last night for a belated Valentine's dinner.  I wasn't expecting it to be difficult to make a reservation, but the earliest seating they had was at 9:00 pm. That's later than I like to eat dinner, but hey, we were willing to for the experience. Upon arrival I received a long stem red rose and there was a vase on the table to hold it. We were seated in the back of the restaurant, passing several booths and intimate looking tables, many of which were open.  The menu looked amazing! We really struggled to decide what to order. We asked the market price on the 2 Broiled Alaskan Lobster Tails ($89), as well as the lb. of Alaskan King Crab legs ($110 or $120 - I can't recall). We decided to share the lobster tails as well as Filet de Boeuf - Atlantis (Ten ounce filet wrapped with bacon; served with lump crab and bearnaise sauce) ($62). Up to this point everything is good, the atmosphere, the service, etc.  The table side salad arrived and I ordered Caesar dressing, tomatoes, egg crumbles, artichoke hearts and hearts of palm, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper. It looked amazing! And the taste? Fishy. I didn't get it. I didn't add the shrimp. Maybe they use anchovies in their dressing, but I typically like that. For whatever reason my salad tasted fishy. I ate most all of it anyway.  They seated a party of 6 adults directly behind us, and a party of 6 or 7 young women directly behind them. What started out as a nice romantic evening turned in to loud conversation and boisterous laughter from the surrounding tables. Then when their salad service arrived the waiter was talking louder than everyone trying to take the orders. We sat and ate and complained about the noise, but there was nothing we could do.  When our meals arrived they looked so delicious! They removed the tails from the shell foe us and brought heated butter. The first few bites of the filet were good, but not very tender like you would expect filet to be. I kept finding bites of fat from the bacon that surrounded it. By the time we got to see the center of the steak it was obvious it was not properly cooked. We ordered medium, and not only was the center bright red but we both had bloody plates. We didn't send it back but we should have. We didn't finish the filet but we brought it home for leftovers. The lobster was actually pretty good. It was cooked perfectly, not at all rubbery. The mashed potatoes were delicious, but the asparagus was a let down.  They asked us if we wanted coffee after dinner, but didn't ask if we wanted dessert. I didn't, but I thought it was a little rude that they didn't offer. Instead they did bring out our plate of chocolate covered strawberries, apricots and figs. The strawberry I had was good, the bf said his had little flavor.  All in all, it wasn't the hyped up experience we were expecting. The food was meh...  and not properly cooked. The service was good, but the atmosphere was ruined from the noise. With tax and tip it was basically a $200 dinner. For that price I'll go elsewhere next time.",

I love steak but I go a little more exotic here with the rack of lamb or sea bass.  The best part of the meal is the table side service like the salad cart and dessert flambe that are fun to watch and harken back to the classic high end dinning experience.  They also have a sommelier which was kind of cool to see him at the tables tasting wine with his giant medallion hanging off his neck like flavor flav.",

The shrimp and escargot were great. The crab cakes weren't good at all. Very little crab and way too much bread crumbs.  The salad was great, but the guy who made it table side was even better. One of the high lights of the evening for sure.  For dinner we got the filet and a lobster. The filet was good but they were either a little skimpy on the sides or using too large of plates. The lobster was over cooked. For dessert we stuck with the chocolate dipped strawberries and they were nice. Overall it was nice evening.",

Located inside Four Queens, this is a hidden little gem of a restaurant.  It is definitely and old school steakhouse.  Dimly light with low ceilings; you can just imagine the type of business dealings that went on back in the day.  The meal we had was our typical standard fare.  We shared the crab cakes and had a wonder table side salad prepared customized to our liking-nice touch.  The entrees were presented well and although they took a lot of time, I will cut them some slack, because it was busy.  I had the filet and my friend had the lobster tail.  My filet was a little under cooked but not so much as to have it re-fired.  It wasn't the tastiest filet I ever had, so for me, it was a miss.  The lobster tail was cooked to perfection and tasted great.  The sides were good as well.  The service was spot on-even on a busy night.  Would I go again?  I suppose.  I think the whole rose thing is a nice touch given the occasion.",

We arrived early for a birthday celebration and ordered a bottle of wine with the sommelier.  He removed the cork and poured a small taste in the cup around his neck.  Now I've seen hundreds of somms with the adornment here in Vegas and this was the first time I'd ever seen it used so it was charming that he really made the experience.  While chatting with him we found out he'd been at Hugo's for 32 years serving some of the original Rat Pack and famous Vegas gangsters.  Definitely a treat of some old Vegas charm.  When our party arrived and we were seated, we had nothing but the best and most attentive service.  Our waiter Ahmad was right there for any request we had and made some wonderful suggestions.  With 9 of us and each trying something different we tasted a large portion of the menu and everyone raved about the food.  The butter, while very pretty in it's rose shape was THE BEST butter I've ever tasted and the sweet heart shaped crackers were a lovely touch.  This would be the perfect date night for a romantic dinner but were also great for a crowd and were on top of our large group.  When looking at the pictures on here I didn't seen the hot stone appetizer but it's a definite must try.  We even ordered a 2nd for the table because it was such a hit.  I had the lobster which was perfectly prepared and was delicious.  From presentation of the food, the small details like the sorbet and roses for the ladies they excelled at every point.  Honestly I can't say which was better, the food or the service and experience.  I've been raving since we left that it's the best kept secret in Vegas.",

The new owners changed the menu and for what the meal costs it was definitely a let down. The Brussels sprouts were undercooked, might as well been served raw. The potatoes were not real potatoes which is what I would expect at this kind of restaurant. We ordered a shrimp cocktail as an appetizer and since it only comes with three the waiter told us he would \"throw another one in\" which we assumed at no charge. WRONG, they charged us an edition all $7! After 23 years of anniversary dinners, this one was disappointing and certainly makes me rethink where we will go next December.",

There were three aspects of the visit that were lacking for me: The service and attentiveness of our waiter(s), the quality of the food for the price and their inability to be have the wait staff sing happy birthday to my brother (his 60th birthday, btw).   It took our water a long time to approach when we were first seated.  He took part of our drink order, but then had to call over the wine steward because my wife wasn't sure which sparking wine she wanted.  We had been seated for 30 minutes before we had our drinks. By this time we had killed our first basket of bread.  It took three requests to three different people to get a second basket, which ultimately came as we were finishing our entrees.  We had been seated for almost an hour before the salad process even started. Salad was good, but not great.  No bacon bits? My rib-eye steak was good, but not on the same level as Ruth's Chris, even though more expensive.  My wife and sister in law ordered the \"add on\" Crab Legs as a compliment to the steaks ordered by myself and my brother.  The crab was almost flavorless.  The add-on portion of the crab was $61.00 per plate, plus a $27.95 \"split plate fee\" for a salad and overcooked veggies.  We had told both the host and the waiter that we were celebrating my brother's 60th birthday.  As we were at the restaurant for over a 2 hour period, several other guests had the collective waitstaff acknowledge their birthdays with song and a candle lit dessert.  Our waiter either forgot or didn't care to extend the same courtesy to my brother.  When we reminded him after the strawberries had been served, he returned with a dessert and a candle which he lit and then vanished.  Not what we were hoping for.   Overall, I felt like the waitstaff ignored us.  The tables around us seemed like they got their drinks, salads and entrees much quicker and had many more check-ins than we did.  Maybe this is an issue of locals vs. out-of-towners, meaning the staff could tell that we were tourists and didn't have to worry about repeat business.   With all of the fantastic restaurants in Vegas, I would be reluctant to return to Hugo's Cellar and spend another $424",

(5/5) Steak was very thick and juicy and cooked to perfection! Absolutely delectable!  The garlic mashed potatoes (4/5) did not disappoint as well. I just wish the portion size was a tad bit greater, but still, they were very good!  The table side salad (4/5) was a real treat in itself! I opted for the Caesar dressing with some shrimp, croutons, parmesan, and tomatoes. Very tasty and great portion size! Not a tiny salad by any means!  Chocolate dipped strawberries (5/5) were a great treat after the main course! Strawberries were HUGE! I could have had a couple more of these!  - Three layer cake (4/5) was a very satisfying way to complete the meal. Not too sweet, but very delicious! Also was the perfect portion size, as I was stuffed after the main course!  Service (5/5)  Absolutely charming and attentive service! Some of the staff have fantastic stories about some famous people who have dined here in the 70's and 80's! It just adds to that classic, old school vibe that I absolutely love!  My only complaint was with how the deserts were presented. I was led to believe that the desert was part of the main entree due to the fact that the waiter approached us and just told us to pick one. Every other steakhouse I've been to will ask if you wish to have desert before asking you to just \"choose\" one. I was so stuffed by the awesome steak and potatoes that I probably would not have had desert otherwise. It's not  huge thing, but I didn't care for that. (minus 1/2 star)  Ambiance (4/5) Classic, old school feel to the place. All of the waitstaff were in tuxedos. The room was tastefully decorated. Ladies were given long stemmed roses. Great little touches led to a fantastic atmosphere!  This was a great experience and I will be sure to recommend Hugo's Cellar to others as it was recommended to me!  4.5 stars!",

    "text": "OUTSTANDING!!   Located in the Four Queens Casino, it reminds you about the glamour of how Las Vegas used to be. Every staff member is dressed in 3 piece suits, polished and friendly. They give every lady a single rose upon entry. The decor is old school Vegas with the brick work and stained glass light fixtures. It's dark and it's the perfect spot to have an intimate dinner date. My BF made reservations for my birthday so we were seated right away.   The dinner starts with a delicious bread basket and drinks. My vodka martini was nice and strong and the left over drink was served over ice. The amount of drink they gave me was close to 3 glasses full. A+ for me!!!  Next, someone comes to your table with the salad cart full of options. Toppings included tomatoes, onions, eggs, croutons, mushrooms, artichokes, etc. Their Cesar dressing was amazing!! They make the dressing fresh so you can really taste the anchovies and all the other spices. My only gripe was the server poured waaaaay too much dressing over my salad. After finishing the salads, they serve you a raspberry sorbet to cleanse your palate for your main course.   I ordered the seafood trio which came with a jumbo lump crab cake, Chilean sea bass and grilled shrimp. The crab cake was full of crab meat and flavorful. The sea bass was so flaky and moist. The shrimp was lackluster compared to the other two and a tad bit over cooked. My BF ordered the rib eye medium rare. Perfection!! The steak was tender and cut like butter. Super juicy!   Your dinner comes with a light dessert consisting of two chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots served with fresh whipped cream. The whipped cream was the best part! I could have licked the bowl, but I held back. Lol! Of course they do offer more decadent desserts on their menu. As a bonus, our server Oscar brought me a chocolate lava cake for my birthday!   Thank you to the staff of Hugo's Cellar for making my birthday special. This will definitely be a spot to visit again!!",

When you go into the Four Queens you actually go down to a cellar of sorts. Once inside you are given a red rose which is very nice, you won't have that experience anywhere else. The dining room is quite spacious and the lighting is perfect, it sets the perfect ambiance.    There is honestly no need to order an appetizer prior to your main course they make a tableside salad that is very filling. Prior to dinner, you are given sorbet to cleanse your palate.  For dinner, we had the prime rib which was cooked perfectly and the Chilean Sea Bass both were absolutely delicious. After dinner, we received a molten chocolate lava cake which was to die for and an assortment of fruits.   We look forward to making Hugo's a tradition for whenever we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "I've been going to Las Vegas since I was 18 in the mid-1980's. I've been lucky enough to have friends and family out there to suggest many things. Between that and my adventurous spirit, I've been to & experienced great places\\events. Was pleasantly surprised when my aunt & uncle (originally from NJ) took us here. Hugo's is in the older, downtown section near Fremont. In the basement of the Four Queens Hotel & Casino. it's been there over 30 years and is TRUE OLD SCHOOL dining. Waiters in tuxedos, Sommelier available.  Table side service : Salad (cart) prepared as you tell them what you want in it. certain entrees like fish flambeed, desserts too..... Professionally made cocktails. Great selection of spirits. Wine Spectator Award of Excellence since 1993. Best of Las Vegas Reader's Choice since 1991.  If there is just 1 \"hole in the wall\", top spot you try next...this is it. romantic for dates & special occasions (all ladies get a fresh rose on entrance) Just as good for a group of guys or gals who know they are getting a great meal\\service.  Look, there are a TON of places to get a good meal in Vegas..from buffets to casual , to celebrity chef. Heck you can get a $5,000 burger in Vegas. BUT if you're a foodie, you MUST try Hugo's and you'll be back. Just make reservations!  THE FOOD-- Complimentary bread basket has a wide array of artisanal breads including crackers shaped like hearts and the butter in the form of a rose. Most meals comes with a salad prepared from a cart with all types of toppings or you can order it as an app...Crisp romaine lettuce, WITH CHOICES OF  peeled tomato wedges, marinated artichokes,hearts of palm, sliced mushrooms, blue cheese crumbles, toasted croutons,  roasted pine nuts, chopped eggs, red onions and bay shrimp, anchovies, etc etc... Our selection of dressings: Caesar, creamy pepper or honey-orange-walnut vinaigrette....DELISH There are plenty of apps and entrees \"FOR TWO\", that add to the romantic element. APPS--- -Escargot en Croute-- Six plump Escargots sauteed in shallots, garlic, burgundy wine, fine herbs with a puff pastry topping was top notch. -Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes-- Pan-fried jumbo lump crab cakes with citrus chili aioli was very good..more crab than filler that's for sure.... ENTREES--- Although considered a steak house, it has so much more............. -Hugo's Chicken-- Breast of chicken stuffed with sun-dried tomato pesto; served with roasted garlic sauce. -Duckling Anise Flambe-- Duck roasted with licorice spices and herbs; flambeed table-side. usually only salmon and  Chilean sea bass is on the menu. Each offered in 4 great styles. 1-Grilled au Naturel with herb butter. 2-Grilled New England style with seasoned bread crumbs. 3-Pan-seared with Sauce Nantua (on a bed of crab meat topped with delicate shrimp sauce). or 4-En Papillote served with shallots, white wine, julienne carrots, leeks, mushrooms and butter. We had the 3rd, which was Fantastic! There is a dish for 2 for $175 that sounded like a no -brainer: *The Cellars Champion Chateaubriand and Lobster for Two-- Fourteen ounce roasted Filet with two broiled Lobster Tails ...... (save room for )Desserts-- Bananas Foster, Cherries Jubilee, cakes, freuit to dip in chocolate sauce were all great.  Just a great time",

Ordered our favorite, veal scallopini Marsala. The veal cutlets were way too thick for scallopini and had a soggy bread crumb coating some of which had a burned taste and the Marsala sauce was tasteless. Totally different preparation than in the past and just wrong for $69.00.",

Next time I will go for the filet myself as it appeared to be better. I like my steaks thick and the rib eye was large and thinner.    The accompaniments asparagus carrots and red skins were tasty as was wifeys wild rice. Included desert of chocolate flavored fruit along with REAL whipped cream hit the spot.  Also had real butter with the breads   One table over had the banana foster table side show and it was inviting. We would of done the same but were well filled and a standard desert is included with any entree as is the salad.   Drinks were martinis and here was  really surprised as it actually 2 1/2 martinis. They serve with a chilled crafte  and it refilled the glass  1 1/2 times. Sort of put the stops on wine with dinner.   Service was a 5 star establishment with a well intending staff. Many have been here for a decade or more. Our main waiter has been here for 29 years.   Down side is no view as it is actually a cellar.   Will definitely return.",

She looked online and found this one, so we headed downtown. We didn't know exactly where it was located, so we parked in the D parking lot. But it's in the Four Queens, so if you want your parking validated, make sure you park in the right lot. We had an amazing experience, from the host who gave us beautiful long stemmed roses, to the customized salads, the delicious dinners (scallops and filet mignon), and the desserts. I've attached some pics. It's a pricey restaurant for a special occasion, but it's well worth it!",

We were well dressed because we enjoy going out on the town in style. The staff was impeccable dressed and very welcoming. We didn't have reservations, they accommodated us anyways. After looking over the menu I chose the Beef Wellington. The initial course was a fresh bread basket. Then my wife's Lobster Bisque came out. There was a table side salad bar that the staff carted to your side and mixed together before you. After that we were given a gelato palate cleanser before our main course. The Beef Wellington was perfect. Crust was flaky and well cooked the fillet was a perfect rare steak. I was able to take a portion off with my fork.

We chose Hugo's Cellar because this restaurant was on many lists for romantic restaurants. It wasn't romantic at all.  It was nice to get a rose when we first walk in. We get to our table, and it's nothing close to romantic. It was VERY loud, mostly because there were 2 tables of guys squabbling back and forth, and NO background music whatsoever.   The professionalism of the wait staff was below par, the only professional waiter was the wine connoisseur. The waiters were disorganized and easily distracted.  The food was good, that was the extra two stars I gave, but it wasn't better than the food from any other reputable steakhouse.   You are better off going to another place and paying less per meat item, and it being just as good!",

    "text": "Wow. It has been a while since a restaurant was a 5 star in my book. Everything was perfect. I arrived and was quickly seated. The host picked a rose that was perfect for me, meaning he didn't just grab any one.   The menu has plenty of upscale options. Unfortunately I do not like seafood and did not try their shrimp or lobster options. I opted for the filet minion. I ordered it medium well and it was perfect! My meal came with mashed potatoes and veggies which were perfect. The portions are much larger than I expected, and was able to take my meat home to enjoy for breakfast, as well as my husband's prime rib.   The service was above and beyond amazing . The waiters were attentive and had great conversations. Our wine specialist (forgot what he was called) suggested I wine which I did enjoy.   This place has history and the best service I have had in a long time. The only thing I didn't like was how some people did not have on business casual attire and still were allowed to dine. Some people had hats and tshirts while dining while my husband and I made a little more effort to uphold the business casual expectation.",

We had a martini, served in a separate flask and sitting in ice to start it off...very Frank and Dean!we were served the bread basket which was good. Now for more old school....tableside prepared Caesar salad, done very well and tasted great. My beloved chef wife was a bit miffed that the croutons weren't home made...lol. To clear the palate, they deliver a taste of sorbet....We each had the NY Strip, it was very good, comes with garlic mashed and asparagus...no exceptions and no other choices. The real hit was the service and Jamie an Mark were the best. Wonderful ambiance as well.  Finally for our special day came chocolate covered strawberries, figs, and a lava cake. Put all that together and we had a romantic evening",

The hostess replied that no such reservation was made. I showed her the confirmation on my phone and she said it was not submitted, but a table would be available at 7:30, which we took.   Meanwhile,  i was contacted stating that I had not honored my reservation. I responded with a summary of the events. When we went back, I showed the hostess the email exchange. She said she didn't know I was the Rick on the reservation , as she had three other Ricks... Sure.  Best part of the meal: the salad cart.  The steaks were bland, only mashers and fingerling potatoes, no baked.  A bland assortment of mixed vegetables.    After our order,, the waiter all but disappeared. We were served by bussers and helpers. The waiter didn't even show to present the bill.   No apologies, nothing. A table in a corner with a waiter who served us at his convenience.  Not worth it.",

This restaurant always does right for everyone and it's just fantastic. The greeters are always friendly and polite. The tables are comfortable and we got a booth this time which was really lovely. The service from the waiters and all of the staff is bar none. Respectful, friendly, professional. No matter how busy they get, they are always at the top of their game. We ordered the Chateau Briand and lobster tail for two which was amazing. It comes with two salads which are made at your table which were delicious. Really delicious bread and butter comes before that and we did not get an appetizer because we knew we would be getting a lot of food, which we did. After we were done eating, even if you don't order dessert, they bring a lovely tray of some chocolate covered fruit with a fresh little pot of whipped cream in the middle. It is delicious! The prices are more than reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber. This is our favorite place to go to the eat before we go to a show at the Smith Center. It is very close. It is located in the four queens hotel. The four queens hotel itself desperately needs a massive overhaul, but Hugos cellar is located downstairs off the casino floor and it is a hidden gem.",

We love the Old School atmosphere with a beautiful rose to set the theme!  Thanks to Terry for knowing sometimes you don't want what's trending at the moment.  We wanted to step back in time and that's exactly what we did.  Thank you for making our celebration perfect.  Afterwards, a short walk to Container Park was truly a fun ending!  Thanks again!",

    "text": "Dark wood ceilings, brick walls, dim lights and mustard colored table clothes. Are you in 1970's Vegas? You could be if you came to Hugo's Cellar.   The Four Queens in located downtown and not in the best of areas. We pulled up to the valet and no one was there to greet us. We waited a while for someone to finally show up to park the car but thats another story. Hugo's is located in the center of the old casino, down stairs. It is downstairs and dimly lit. A classic old  Vegas style steakhouse.   We were greeted by the Matre'D and seated in a half booth in the back. Our waiter arrived quickly to greet us and take our drink orders. After that, we didn't see much of him. He did return for our entree orders and then not again until we were finished with our food. I loved the salad cart. You are able to customize your salad with several different items and dressings. The person making the salad will ask what dressing you want and then go through all the toppings. The salad was excellent.   For our entrees we chose the prime rib and the rib eye. They were both good,  but nothing I can't find at any other steakhouse without having to deal with downtown. We had the chocolate lava cake for dessert which was good.   I didn't find it as great as others, but I have been to a lot of great steakhouses. There is no reason to go out of your way to go downtown if your just looking a great steak dinner or romantic evening out.",

Well look no further because Hugo's Cellar is the place for you.    This is one of the  most romantic dinner dates I could have taken my girlfriend on for valentines day.  When you first walk in the lady gets a long stem red rose.  You are the seated and you are in a beautiful environment.   With your meal comes with a table side salad that is made right next to you and you have the option of adding whatever it is you want to it.  For my entree I had lamb and my girlfriend had a steak which we both really enjoyed.  You also get a dessert that comes with it all as well.  When you are ordering your food it may seem pricey but remember that you are getting a huge table side salad customized before your eyes but also a delicious dessert as well.    They waiter was amazing and they sommeliler was very knowledgeable about his profession and not only seems to know a lot but seems very passionate about wine as well.  He knew a about the history of whatever wine you were choosing and whatever year you are choosing from and had many stories to tell as he was pouring up your wine.

You walk down the stairs into a cove of heaven -- a rose for the ladies, the best food, and a staff that treats you as if you are their only table. We order the same things every time because why change perfection. We start with a seafood tower for two and the hot rock for two. There are four of us. Next is salad time with all your favorites, table-side prepared, of course. I move onto a blackened, Pittsburgh-style Ribeye and the garlic mashed potatoes. This time I ventured off to the potatoes au gratin (wasn't a fan). The cosmos are a two-pour and you get this cute little chiller for the second half so your cocktail stays cold until you are ready to drink your second.  At the end of your meal they bring you chocolate-covered strawberries, apricots, and, I think, dates.  You can eat those but don't go without trying the banana's foster. This place is 10 stars and the best bang for your buck in Vegas. Definitely a must-try!",

Called ahead to see if gluten free options or accommodations were available as a member of our party has celiacs. The host confirmed, so we made the reservation. However upon sitting down at our table, the wait staff made if very clear they didn't have any gluten free options other than a side of vegetables, and their \"accommodations\" were serving the food without any sauces/binding agents. Meaning their kitchen lacks the technical ability to create any sauce without flour (RED ALERT, their line cooks can't work beyond a predefined recipe, cooking 101).   Decor was cheap, mis-matching chairs, faux brick walls.  The salad they hyped up could have been achieved with a run of the mill salad bar.   Initial drink orders took 25+ min and were average at best. Took our food orders before drinks even came out.  All food lacked seasoning!  $45 Salmon was a pre-packaged frozen filet with manufactured grill marks.  If you have had any experience with modern cooking styles and standards that exist in larger cities, don't bother with this place.",

Our server greeted us quickly, offered the wine menu and sent for the sommelier. The sommelier was very nice and struck up a nice random conversation. They offered a couple half bottle wines.  Started with lobster bisque and spinach artichoke dip with crab meat. Yum! Both were very rich and very flavorful. Already getting full from that plus the delicious bread and rose shaped butter.  Ordered the beef Wellington (server said its about 10oz filet) and rack of lamb. Both were cooked perfectly with an amazing garlic mashed potato and veggies. And by ordering entrees, we had salad made table side (honey orange dressing..?? Sure! With some artichokes, shrimps, tomatoes with Parmesan and fresh pepper), a mini sorbet to cleanse the palate, and chocolate dipped strawberry, apricot, and fig.  But I can't finish the night without trying the awesome loan coffee and a small dessert. Nothing disappoints. I'm amazed. This place is the real deal. Can't wait to go back!  Price was... Not bad at all. And dress code isn't that strictly enforced seeing how other were dressed.",

    "text": "My last visit to Hugo's Cellar was 30 years ago and I loved the place. Now fast forward to my 7th anniversary and I wanted a special dinner. In 30 years, nothing had changed. Even the sommelier was same. They have perfect every element in a dinner. From service to ambiance to food and even overall value. From the red rose given to every female at the entry to the salad made at your table to your perfection. My vodka martini was perfect and easily the equivalent of 3 normal drinks. Her cocktail was also perfect. I love their salad, I chose Caesar dressing and asked for anchovies and got a big plate of them. We shared the rack of lamb, cooked just right and tender as could be. Maybe the vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes were a little underwhelming but this is being very picky. Every table gets a selection of desserts from strawberries and apricots dipped in chocolate. Even the cream for the coffee was whipped with cinnamon sticks to add. We have decided to come back every year for our anniversary. Overall considering the salad, dessert and service I even feel the price is reasonable for the quality and feel.",

    "text": "This will be expensive meal.  However, we spent less then other nice meals in Vegas.  The atmosphere is interesting, it definitely feels throw back and its nice that's its literally steps down so it feels like it is in a cellar.  Its dimly lit and has a very cozy feeling.  They give all the women a rose, which is cheezy and vintage in the best way.  I did really dislike the fact that there was no bathroom in the restaurant, you have to go into the casino and the casino and the bathrooms are not near as nice as the restaurant.  There is a lot included with entrees.  This is really nice because it allows you to enjoy the evening with spaced out servings.  However one of my complaints were its way too much food.  We started with a bottle of wine and the bread/lavosh.  I love the fact that sommelier serves and tastes every single bottle.  At other places we went to they didn't seem to bother for cheaper bottles.  The bread was really good and I was big fan of the lavosh, I haven't had good lavosh in ages.    There is sorbet that was nice to cleanse the palate.    Then was the salad cart.  Again vintage, but I loved it and honestly wish more places did this.  It's not just a garden salad there are tons of selection of items to add and different dressings.  My husband and I can both be picky, so it was nice to not ask to hold things and just be able to add what you want.  Everyone said it on here and it really is when of the best salads I have had.    Then with your entry comes vegetables and potatoes.  I got the ten ounce filet.  I love filet but this was about 2 times too big for me.  It was amazing and the Bearnaise was really good, but I was stuffed just getting through half of it with everything we had before.  I wished they had a smaller option.  My husband got the filet with shrimp and loved that.    The chocolate dipped fruit was really good and nice to end the evening.  I was so stuffed I only ate one.  I wanted more of everything, so it was hard to control myself, but next time I will eat less bread to save room for entree and dessert.  Overall service was great, very attentive.  We were in a little bit of a hurry and they were good about taking care of us quickly.",

My fiance and I brought my grandad to Vegas as he's visiting from England. We figured we'd do one fancy dinner while we're here and I'm so glad we picked Hugo's Cellar. Jaime, Eric, John and Wuudu were all extremely friendly and welcoming and made the experience one of the best we've ever had when we hadn't even received any food yet!   I got the beef Wellington, fiance got rack of lamb and grandad got ribeye. You get a tableside salad before your entree which was yummy too. The meals were all gorgeous and cooked to perfection. I have never tried Wellington before and this meal blew me away.   We ended it with chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots with fresh cream. We had no room for the extensive desserts they offer (next time!)   Thank you all so much again for the wonderful dining experience.",

The meat cut like butter and had great favor.   The service was so refreshing- old school vibe and every restaurant should get training from them before opening!

We shared crab cakes as an appetizer and they were excellent.  The at the table salad service was pretty good.  Main courses came out and it was downhill from there.  Wife ordered the beef wellington. The server said it comes out medium/medium rare. It was rare.  I ordered the prime rib and it was nothing special...pretty bland as far as prime rib goes.  Usually the prime rib has some crust around it, some flavor. This one did not.  The ticket came out to $170 after tip. For this kind of money, everything needs to be on point.",

It may look expensive when you look at the prices, but be prepared, the prices of each item includes bottle of water, custom made salad in front of you and desert as well as side dishes for your main course.   When you walk in, they give you a red rose which has a spot for you on your table to put up, also it is yours to take home. If you are looking for a romantic place to go on a date with your significant other, I would def recommend it.   Food was very tasty. Wine selection is amazing and sommelier was very helpful on our selection. Unlike upstairs the casino, restaurant was very quite.    Overall great! Recommended for everyone without kids!",

The service is top quality at this place and I would recommend it for couples or non-couples.  The salad cart is kind of cool, but doesn't compare to my experiences at HOPR in SF.  My salad tasted like anchovies because they use the same tongs to mix everything...just an fyi.  I ordered the rib eye which was pretty awesome.  The sides were mediocre and it probably didn't need a slathering of sauce...it was such high quality beef and cooked properly, so I felt bad about it  being all sauced up.  My dining companions ordered the beef wellington and the filet with foie gras.  The wellington tasted good to me, but my friend eating did not feel the same.  The filet was a bit overcooked (medium rare was ordered, and it was medium well), but still pretty tasty.   So I am kind of mixed, a lot of things were great but some things were not so great.  For now, they get 3 stars and I will probably go back.",

Place was very busy and service was terrible.  Only bright side of the service was John the Sommelier.  Only thing neg about him was it took about 30 minutes for him to come to our table.  Our waiter rec we skip him and just let him pick us a wine... he brought out a Robert Mondavi I smirked and said please go get the Sommelier.  He rec a great bottle from Napa.  So 1 hour into our evening and we have our wine and bread still waiting on the shrimp scampi and the crab cake.  The whole night it felt like we were forgotten about was very disappointing.  Finally the apps arrive both tasted good no complaints.  This time we are almost at 2 hours in the cellar and I'm beginning to get inpatient but the rave reviews I have read on Yelp had me looking forward to our main courses.  They arrived I ordered the 16 oz NY and the wife ordered the beef wellington.  The 16oz NY was VERY disappointing not sure they seasoned the steak with any salt and pepper.  It was cooked prefect medium rare which is what I ordered but was missing flavor.  Also I expected a much better quality of steak.  I would have graded the steak Choice or select far from the dry aged prime discribed on the menu.  I ate about 1/4 of the steak the mashed potatoes were very buttery and fatty.  They shimmered in the lighting.  My wife ordered the beef wellington and she was pleased with the taste and flavor of it.  I tried it and also thought it was very good.  finally finished the main course 2.5 hours into the evening had to rush out to make it to our 10 O'clock show.... Never again unless you like a 2.5 hour dinner I would look somewhere else.  Don't order a NY steak you will likely be disappointed.",

    "text": "This restaurant is absolutely fabulous for many reasons. Although, I'll give 4 of 5 stars because there were a few opportunities for improvement too.   Starting with the good - my husband and I went there for our 5 year anniversary and it was a special night for us also because this was where we got engaged. We were seated right away and were pleasantly surprised to see that we had the same waiter and sommelier as we had at our last visit, nearly 6 years ago. Service was great, food was equally great. The table side salad preparation is unique and interesting. I had the raspberry chicken as my entree and it was delicious. For dessert, we had the complimentary chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots (yum!) and then we were surprised with another dessert, with \"congratulations\" written in raspberry sauce on the plate. Finally, our waiter was preparing bananas foster at a nearby table and asked if I had ever had it before. I haven't, so of course, he surprised us again with a small portion of that dessert too. I was incredibly full and certainly shouldn't make any habits of indulging in three desserts in one night but it was a great gesture and of course another ridiculously tasty treat too good to pass up.  Now, for the suggested areas of improvement  - when making our reservation, my husband specified in the notes that it was a special night because of our anniversary and engagement, so, for a restaurant of this caliber, you'd expect the hostess, who has access to these notes, to welcome you back and congratulate you on your special day. Instead, the hostess was less than personable and simply escorted us to the table and left. Not a deal breaker move, but it would've added that special touch you would expect here. Additionally, for a restaurant with these prices and this reputation, I was surprised to see that the lamp on the hostess podium was held together with scotch tape. A dap of wood glue would do the trick .. Just a bit tacky as a first impression when you walk up to check in.  Finally, I really like the cozy, dated ambiance but the blue tableclothes have got to go. A warm cream cloth would do wonders and make it look a little brighter, fresher, and clean.",

Then my aunt remembered where the \"other' place was that they wanted to eat @ on their last trip out there.  It is located in the lower level of the 4 Queens Casino in the old downtown area on Freemont St.  Upon arrival in this little basement restaurant, the ladies were given roses to take to our dinner table.  The place was very seductive looking, w/ very low lighting and some nice jazz playing softly in the backround.  Three waiters took turns pouring our Evian water, handing us menus, and taking our cocktail orders.  The menu was a great mix of top notch seafood and Grade A cuts of meat.  I ordered the Tournados Hugo.... two 5 oz filets wrapped in bacon and topped w/ foie gras sereved w/ a delicious beef stock reduction.  Dad had the swordfish, aunt had the scallops, mom had veal oscar, and uncle had the veal chop.    Before dinner, your waiter comes tableside w/ a salad cart and prepares each salad separatly!  It's like going to the salad bar without actually getting up to go to the salad bad.  Friggen Awesome.    After the customized salad, the table is sereved a mini sorbet ice cream cones to cleanse the pallet.  Raspberry sorbet to be more specific.  How cute and delicious.    All of the diners were A- or better.  my foie gras left a bit to be desired, but that is about the only thing i could find wrong during the entire dinner.  The prices look pretty hefty when you first sit down and look @ the menu,(most dinner are $40 and higher) but you have to realize how much you are actually getting w/ this dinner.  The amount of food was perfectly stuffing.  And even if you don't want desert, they bring you a tray of chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots w/ whipped cream!  Other nice things:  Martinis come in small, iced carafes, so you can drink and then pour more when you are ready.  A wine steward actually brings your wine directly from the wine cellar, not your waiters.  Nice to have a wine steward so they can answer any questions you may have about your fermented grapes.  When in Vegas, GO~!",

    "text": "Waited months to put this on our dining list as the last few times in Vegas ,we ran out of time. Was disappointed and will not be going back. The great thing, was the service. Our waiter was so friendly, not pushy and so kind. We had 8:30pm reservations. My sister and I. Appetizer was spinach/artichoke dip. Very good flavor, but runnier than most we've ever had. The salads, yes, they do table side,molts of choices, excellent display and server. Sister ordered triple seafood sampler, and I had the prime rib. She really liked her food, me, my prime rib was cooked perfect to \"medium\", but not very warm/hot. I did not want to send it back, ( really, at Hugo's), no, I just couldn't. The red, garlic mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus were good. Just so disappointed in the meat. Prime rib just also didn't have a lot of flavor. I like that the au jus is served on the side so it's not swimming in it. They do give roses to all the ladies upon arriving and wrap them for you on leaving. It is Old World like in Al Capone days, but so so neat a place. It is not cheap, but do not mind paying for an excellent meal, no matter where I'm traveling. Just was disappointed, as sister had been there many times and I just can't return. I do not believe a chef should send out just warm food, especially a steak.",

    "text": "We went to dinner here on Sunday night at 6.  We had a reservation and they sat us immediately and gave me a red long stem rose.  Nice start so far.  The restaurant is in an unusual lower part of The 4 Queens Hotel which does kinda feel like your in a cellar.  We had a booth along the wall.  The service was top notch from the beginning to the end.  We had a busser that brought bread and water, a server that took our order, a man that had a rolling salad bar that had tons of goodies to choose from that he made at your table.  I ordered the bacon wrapped 10 ounce filet and crab, I talked my husband in to the Chilean Sea Bass.  Both entrees were served piping hot and they were delicious and cooked perfectly.  The portions were huge on the fish and the steak was def at least 10 ounces.  Both our sides came with the entree and both were very good, I had garlic mashed and he had rice.  My glass of wine was very reasonable at $6 a glass.  The best part though was my husband ordered a martini and it came and included a crystal ice bucket to hold part of the martini and keep it cold..  REALLY IMPRESSIVE idea (we think any way :))! With the meal, they included chocolate covered strawberries and figs, that was a nice touch..  We both had an entree, I had one wine and he had 2 martinis, our bill without tip was $149, which I felt was fair for the level of service and all the little extras we seemed to enjoy.  Def not somewhere you'd probably go once a month but I saw a lot of folks celebrating anniversaries, great place for special occasions.   I would have given it 5 stars had the bathroom not been FOREVER away... this type of establishment should have its own restroom but it is old and space is limited so I doubt it's an option.",

    "text": "Vegas is filled with steakhouses.  Palazzo, alone, has three of them.  So with so many options on the strip, its going to have to take a pretty good recommendation for me to stray off the strip for my savory appetite.  Hugo's cellar was recommended to us by one of our customers and he mentioned that it was one of the best steaks he has ever had.  Big words, when it comes to steak in Vegas (..and it was mentioned to us during dinner at Delmonico's).  Nonetheless, my girlfriend and I made it our mission to try Hugo's the next time we were in Vegas.  Here is the short of it:  Pros: Your lady friend gets a rose when you enter the restaurant.  The amount of food you get for 50 dollars (steak) is a lot.  You get bread, chocolate covered strawberries, salad, and potatoes or vegetables. Reasonably priced compared to most, if not all a la carte steakhouses  Cons: Decor is more old school (or hasn't been changed in a while).  Fits in well with the Fremont street casinos. The steak and the meal were just OK for me.  I definitely left full but I wouldn't necessarily say it was melt in your mouth or the steak was anything to write home about.    Vegas Cons:  In a city where image can be anything, this place just doesn't cut it.  Its in a cellar and it is on Fremont street.  There are so many other choices in Vegas that can give you a better view, or a more comfortable seating, or give you better recognition or name.   The crowd is older, not as dressy and fits more with the surroundings.  I wore dark jeans and a nice shirt (standard guy-wear) and I felt overdressed.    In the end though, I would eat there again.  However, one has to understand the type of meal you are getting and what you are paying for.  With that in hand, its one of the best deals on the strip.",

A beautiful rose is presented to the ladies as they take you to your table. We were a little pressed for time so we didn't order appetizers.  We ordered the rib eye but they didnt let us choose the potatoes and the menu gave a choice. The salad arrived and the portion was enough for a meal in itself and very good. The rib eye arrived with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It looked good but was a tough piece of meat for the price. All I can say is eat anything but meat. Chocolate covered strawberries to end the meal was nice too.  I should have read the reviews first. Live and learn I guess.",

You get a taste of some breads.. and the butter is shaped like a rose!! They keep your water and drinks full all the time. The staff here is amazing!!!! So nice and constant watching your table. It's pricey!! But so worth the special night.  They pull out a salad cart and make your salad table side. I loved it!! After your salad they bring u some sorbet to cleanse your palate and a hot napkin for your hands. My friend had lamb and his wife had steak and shrimp it comes with garlic red potatoes asparagus and rice . When the plates are placed before you,, you will want to get your camera!! not only is it delicious!  the presentation is gorgeous.your dessert is included it's chocolate.

    "text": "A fine dining establishment in the Four Queens?  The hell, you say!  The fam was all fired up to go to Binion's Steakhouse, but it was closed over the Holidays.  I suggested we try Hugo's Cellar as I had read some good reviews on Yelp.  We made reservations with the snooty maitre d', and headed off to the casino bar to have a few drinks.  Ugh.  Snooty maitre d'.  Oh well.  I tell you what, I was impressed by the quality of the food at the Cellar.  Everything was outstanding.  My steak was fabulous.  They make individual salads to order at your table - the poor salad dude had to ask everyone at the table what they wanted on their salad, one item at a time.  Playing twenty questions with the salad guy got a little tiresome, but he had a good sense of humor in dealing with our (my) general drunkenness.  Artichokes?  No.  Olives?  Yes.  Anchovies?  Shit, why not?  Croutons?  Yes. Hippopotamus?  What?  No.  Etc....  Our waiter and the sommelier crossed way over into the Land of Pretentiousness, making them easy to mock for a drunk guy such as myself.   Having said that, I've got to say that the service was very good, especially if you like pretentious servers.  Everything was included in the price of an entree, including the salad, a starch, and even chocolate-covered desserts.  Did you know that apricot is pronounced \"APE-ri-cot?\"  I didn't.  Really, you did?  No shit!  I'm from the Midwest, sue me.  I don't really care for \"APE-ri-cots,\" so I gave mine to a fellow diner.  And I giggled like a little girl every time the waiter said \"APE-ri-cot.\"  Not a good performance by me, I have to say.  We were there late in the evening and were among the last folks to leave.  This gave me the opportunity to actually see snooty maitre d' guy step out of character while talking to water refilling guy.  Snooty maitre d' guy actually seemed like a decent guy, which was nice.  Let's bring this home.  I thought the food and service was outstanding at the Cellar.  And the entrees were all priced at around $40-$50 or so.  Very good value.  I would highly recommend this place, and I'll try to be sober next time I make an appearance.  Really.  I promise.",

I can say anything you order comes with potato's, (boiled red, or whipped), veggies, and a salad that is made to order; right at your table..   The steaks are all large portions, and the fish is well prepared.  But NOTHING but the salad, really was above average..   So, If your in the area of downtown L.V., and you want to impress a date, or have an occasion to celebrate, (and your not concerned about spending an average of $40 bux per entree); come and enjoy.   Otherwise, I'd say stay on the strip, and go to Encore or Something nice @ the MGM or Mandalay Bay. (The MIX that is on the top floor of THE HOTEL is MUCH better, and there the ambiance is topnotch..",

As we were celebrating an anniversary and a birthday, a special dessert was presented to the celebrating parties; the occasion was spelled out in chocolate on the plates. Very good!

    "text": "First of all, this was my first \"Old Vegas\" dining experience and it was fantastic! I had SO much fun. It actually made me wonder why we started to move away from this type of dining. Thank goodness there are still places like this keeping it classic.  The hotel offers free valet and self-parking (four hours with validation) and it's just a quick walk down Carson to Fremont.  When you walk down the stairs from the casino floor, you really feel like you're in a cellar. There's a small lounge/bar area near the host stand. Even if you're here for dinner, I'd recommend some time at the bar with veteran bartender Dean. What a personality! Tell him what you're in the mood for or what you like to drink and he'll make you something new and name it on the spot. Your cocktails also come with their own refills - a beautiful crystal bucket filled with crushed ice and a carafe of whatever you're drinking. I had the Raspberry Lemon Drop and it was great; the right balance of sweet and liquor. Also only at the bar are complimentary mixed nuts, adorable heart-shaped water crackers, and spreads: Chicken Liver Pate and Smoked Cheddar with Bacon and Pimientos. The pate was amazing! I could have sat at the bar all night eating pate and crackers.  If you're a lady, you receive a fresh red rose prior to seating. They even have vases at each table to place your rose(s) while dining. Then, when you're ready to leave, they wrap the stem in foil to take with you. They do this EVERY DAY!   Want to know what you should eat? Anything that involves table-side service! After all, you're here for the Old Vegas experience. Gosh, it is so much fun. Especially if you have the honor of dining with server extraordinare Victor. He's been here since 1983 and you'd never guess it with the amount of enthusiasm he has for everything!   We started with the Table-Side Salad (this comes with all entrees or $19 a la carte). The cart has all the salad elements and you tell your server what you'd like and they put it together. If you're with Victor, just have him make your salad. If you're not picky or allergic to anything, tell him to put whatever he wants. It's quite the show and he is extremely entertaining. I had a blast just watching him make the salad! And the salad had EVERYTHING. Romaine lettuce, tomato, red onion, mushroom, anchovies, bay shrimp, marinated artichoke, hearts of palm, hard-boiled egg, parmesan, blue cheese, roasted pine nuts, and croutons. There are three dressings: Caesar, Creamy Pepper, and Honey Orange Walnut Vinaigrette. Victor recommends an unique combination of all three, so of course, I said yes. The salad was delicious. This is a must!  We shared the Duckling Anise Flambe ($40). The duck is roasted with licorice spices and herbs, then flambeed table-side. More of that table-side action. It's also topped with a Grand Mariner duck confit mandarin orange sauce. Served with wild rice and roasted vegetables. The duck was delicious and I loved the sauce.   All entrees come with bottled water, assorted breads (cheese-toasted lavosh and rolls) and rose-shaped butter, their famous table-side salad, fruit sorbet as a palate cleanser (we got adorable mini cones topped with lemon sorbet), fresh vegetables, choice of roasted garlic whipped potatoes, red potatoes with parsley, or wild rice, and chocolate-dipped fruit (strawberries, baby figs, and dried apricots). I mean, WOW.   We finished with Bananas Foster ($18 for 2 people) which is also flambeed table-side. Served with vanilla ice cream in a beautiful goblet and long, slender spoon. YUM.  It was an amazing meal and even better experience. I really didn't understand the hoopla, but now I get it. Service was IMPECCABLE. Each table has TWO servers and a bus boy. Everyone is so professional, crazily attentive, and importantly, thrilled to be there. Our drinks were never empty, our table was always clean, and one time I didn't even realize I dropped my napkin when I stood up and before I knew it, there was a new, folded napkin waiting for me on the table! By the way, if you weren't impressed enough, all the servers have culinary training for their table-side cooking! I truly cannot wait to come back - no need to wait for a special occasion!  Notes: They tend to get busy every night, so reservations are recommended in advance. It's a popular spot for locals and visitors!",

    "text": "We came here for the first time on May 21, for my mans birthday and I have to say, this place is definitely a hidden gem. U think \"Four Queens? Isn't that place super old and run down?\" Well it is! But this place is located slightly underground when u come in and look for it u go down a set of stairs and end up at the front of the restaurant. It has to be the most romantic place I have ever dined at. It's very old school with the brick walls and the servers dressed in two piece tuxs. The ladies receive a rose when u come in, so cute! The tables or booth have a cute candle light area with a single flower vase for your rose. And surprisingly, my man knew the manager who he worked with at a different restaurant, so it was nice to run into someone we knew there he kindly got us a booth in the corner which was perfect! Richard is the manager, and he was kind enough to buy us a drink for my mans birthday!   Now onto the food/drink service - I got a raspberry cocktail (recommended by our sever, so didn't get the name) and my man just got the house cab. Our servers were David (I think) can't remember his name because he didn't really make an impression on us, sadly. But his partner Victor, lat me tell you, he's been there for years, he's an older gentlemen but such a great person! He was the highlight of our night! He was attentive and had a great sense of humor with everything. So thank you Richard for giving us his station just as u recommended he was really great. If u plan on going in, ask for victor u will love him!! Ok so u get bread service they drop off a basket w about three kinds of bread and then u get a cute rose shaped butter (to make it more romantic) hehe. Then we got seafood on ice for two as shown in picture below. It was good nothing special since it is a simple appetizer but it was still yummy. Then you order your entrees and you get a table side salad service! So Victor starts it for u and he just kinda goes down the list and u answer yes or no if u want it in your salad and he makes it right in front of u and he's funny you're guaranteed to laugh with him. Then you are served your salad, u get to choose from three kinds of dressings and he tosses it for u. It comes with every entree! So then u finish your salads and the busser comes and serves you a cute little raspberry sorbet on a cone it's called a \"palette cleanser\" I believe and that was cute and yummy. So they do that before u get your entree. Then u get your food and ugh it's amazing! It comes w a garlic mash and few veggies. I get a ribeye which I personally love ribeye so I always get that (done medium) and my man got a filet (medium rare), it has a name to his entree which we couldn't pronounce it n I let alone can't remember  lol but it all tasted great! (See photos) then we finish our food and move onto dessert. You get a complimentary platter of fig, chocolate strawberries, & apricot. And then we got a birthday dessert it was a chocolate cake that I didn't eat bc I don't like chocolate lol. But the dessert we did order was AMAZING!! It's called a banana froster and it is made table side. Omg I have never had anything so amaZing! See pictures. It has alcohol in it, bananas, and ice cream. U must get it if u dine there!! And before I forget, as Victor made our banana dessert, there was a couple next to us celebrating an anniversary, so with the left over he put it in a little bowl and hands it to the couple which I thought was a sweet touch! They did love the dessert and thanked us for ordering it hehe. My bf joked to myself and said \"should we split the bill for dessert haha. But not really we would never do that and it was their anniversary I'm so glad they enjoyed it as much as we did!! Overall everything was great from when u walk in to when u leave. Sorry if I don't go into too much detail about the food I didn't exactly study the menu and remember what was in it but the service was impeccable. We will definitely return! :) don't forget to ask for Victor!",

    "text": "Best steakhouse I've been to in Vegas. This is always my family go to place and where we bring out of towners for a nice dinner. We used to frequent the Burgundy Room before they closed but Hugos does not disappoint! Great place for a romantic date, celebration dinner, or just a nice night out. Women are always presented with a rose on entry which is a very nice touch. If you're drinking wine, you have a sommelier with a tastevin to taste the wine before you drink it. You have a salad cart that comes around and you are able to pick all the toppings you want along with dressing before they toss it for you. The meal is always outstanding. Steaks and chicken always have great flavor and are cooked to perfection. After your meal you are given chocolate dipped fruits for a final touch. If you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor!",

If you like a perfectly prepared steak this is the place to get it in Vegas. This place is old school, they present all the ladies with a rose, they have a sommelier who comes by to give you wine advice and table side salad. Do not skip the salad, it is delicious. The portions are generous and I have never left hungry.  I look forward to coming back to this place during my next Vegas trip.",

When you walk down the stairs it feels like you've stepped back in time to  vintage Vegas. It reminds me of a place where the old time mobsters would go to have a steak dinner. It's worth checking out if you're ever in the area. The food is very good, and the service is outstanding.",

    "text": "Imagining a perfect meal with a man I love - this place would top the list if steak was the craving.  On this visit I was with my Mom and we were treated like the Queens we are.  This place is in Old Vegas in the cellar of The Four Queens Casino and has been around forever, or so I hear.  This place was recommended by a friend who ventures to Vegas quite often and suggested it as one of our splurge evenings.  And splurge we did...  How classic to offer every lady a rose as we walk in the door, an add on that made me giddy and smiley the minute I walked in the door.  It makes a lady feel special.  The menu is Old World Steakhouse, no surprises here, steak, seafood, salads and everything you would expect from a Steakhouse.  The choice for the evening:  Table-side Salad - romaine lettuce, peeled tomato wedges, marinated artichokes, sliced mushrooms, blue cheese crumbles, toasted croutons, crushed eggs, red onions and bay shrimp.    Escargot En Croute - Six plump escargots sauteed in shallots, garlic, burgundy wine, fine herbs and topped with puff pastry.  Palate Cleanser - Raspberry Sorbet - A refreshing sorbet before steak time!  Filet de Boeuf - Atlantis - A ten ounce filet wrapped in bacon served on a bed of lump crab with Bearnaise sauce.  Included dessert - Chocolate covered fruit, strawberries, figs, and apricots.  The table side salad was a fun experience. A sweet man presents himself with a cart full of fresh ingredients and asks how you want your custom salad.  He makes your salad with flare and finesse.  The honey walnut vinaigrette was unique and gave a kick to the exceptional salad.    My first experience with Escargot and I have to say, may I have another.  I always thought Escargot would be gross which is a total error on my part, they were salty, rich and buttery.  A squeeze of lemon and I was in utter heaven.  Jenn + Escargot = Happiness.  Now if only I had someone feeding them to me...  The Filet de Boeuf was cooked to my requested temperature, medium with crispy bacon encrusting the outside.  A ten oz. filet is a huge portion and I was pleased to take each succulent bite and sop up the Bearnaise sauce on the way to my mouth.  The crab claws were buttery and cooked nicely and I loved sucking every last drop from each claw (sorry, no picture of this, I know you want one).  A menu doesn't need to be complicated when you can execute a steak this perfect with the right amount of seasoning.  Your meal comes with chocolate dipped fruit, which we took to go since we were both stuffed with the best steak of our lives.  If you so desire, you may order additional desserts, one of which is Banana's Foster flambeed table-side.  If I was hungry, this would have been my additional dessert of the night.  Service was impeccable and I wanted for nothing the entire evening.  My mind was read without me knowing it.  Dinner was paced well and everyone was attentive to our needs at every turn.  Well worth the splurge anytime.",

It was our first visit to the Cellar and it was a wonderful place for an old style Vegas meal.  Each of wives was presented a rose when we arrived.  Our salads were prepared individually table side - I did not know places still do that.  We are non drinks so we did not have that service. The prime rib was delicious. The table service was good. The after dinner chocolate tray was good. Our friends were happy with the meal and so were we.",

Roses for the ladies, flowered-shaped butter, elegantly set tables, sorbet between courses for a palette cleanser, chocolate covered fruit at the end - every detail was attended to. All of the food was so delicious.   We started off with several seafood appetizers - the chilled seafood trio was outstanding! Table-side salads def live up to the hype. I was disappointed they were out of beef wellingtons (never had one), but I had a hunch with a late reservation that might happen & had the steak aux poive as a backup - it did not disappoint. Next time, we'll make an earlier reservation to make sure I get to try a Wellington. The drinks were quickly refilled and poured with a strong hand... Because the service here is just amazing. Really wonderful, professional, attentive and personable waiters here. I think we had Oscar and Victor looking after us. And even though you probably won't have room for dessert - try to power through it - they are as delicious as everything else was.   It was such a special night, a dining experience like I've never had before. We had a group of 6 and it was everyone's first time here and we all loved it. It will definitely be on the itinerary for our annual trip to Vegas!",

    "text": "We dined at Hugo's Cellar on Friday July 15, 2016 and I will admit I was slightly nervous. I was nervous because our party included my 9 year old niece.  I know this is not a typical \"kid-friendly\" restaurant (no kid's menus here) so I wasn't sure how staff would react to her dining with us. My niece is generally well behaved, and LOVES her food, so we figured she would enjoy a meal here. After getting dressed up in our \"special occasion clothes\" (as the child calls them) we headed downtown. We made the reservation for 7:00, because this was our arrival day and we weren't sure how long it would take for the deuce bus to make it from the strip to Freemont Street; we wanted to make sure we had plenty of time. We arrived shortly after 6:00 PM, nearly a full hour before our reservation time. We were hungry, so we decided to check and see if they could accommodate our early arrival. As soon as we walked in the Maitre D greeted us and singled out my niece, complementing her dress and calling her the prettiest lady in the room. After handing each of us a rose, they escorted us to our table. After we placed our order, bread and drinks were brought to our table. The bread was superb, with the Lavosh becoming a particular favorite. As other reviewers have mentioned, the table side salad service is delightful. Their orange honey vinaigrette was outstanding. I would return to this restaurant for the salad alone, and I am most certainly not a salad person.  Shortly after our salad plates were cleared, a palate cleansing sorbet was brought out. Our entrees were brought out shortly after this. I ordered the prime rib, which was excellent. It was juicy and tender - it practically melted in my mouth. My best friends each ordered the fillet mignon and my niece ordered the scallops. Everyone raved about their particular orders. After dinner, the complimentary chocolate covered fruit was delivered to our table, along with the desert tray. We decided on a creme brulee (as my best friend can't turn down creme brulee when it's available) and the cherries jubilee, as we knew my niece would enjoy watching the preparation. The creme brulee was average - not bad by any means, but not particularly outstanding. The cherries jubilee was very good, but I think I'd prefer something else off the menu next time.   Hugo's Cellar was a big hit with our group. All staff was welcoming and went out of their way to speak to my niece - my concerns regarding her presence were completely unfounded. When asked about what her favorite part of the trip was all weekend (a weekend that included going to see a show and the Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N) she said the \"fancy dinner\". We will definitely visit Hugo's again, but will probably limit ourselves to a splurge once a year. Cannot recommend this place highly enough!",

After entering the rather outdated but very lively casino floor we recognized the thin red brick walls and began our journey downstairs and into a time of Vegas past.  Greeted by the maitre d' very humble and welcoming, my girlfriend was given a lovely long stem rose and we were escorted to a quaint, low-backed booth in the corner. Quickly the seasoned veteran servers began their well rehearsed procession of drink orders, sommelier service and menu consultation.   One of only a few restaurants that dares to serve French Bordeaux I'd give Hugo's 5 star just for that! Our Martini was served up in a large carafe in a chilled bucket and I'm pretty sure the phrase \"three martini lunch\" was coined here.  The food: Excellent all around. A little too much butter for our diets but expected.  The most remarkable about our evening at Hugo's was the service. We felt as if dining at a friend's home, never rushed or bothered with constant \"how is everything.\" The table-side salad server had been there for 31 years, the sommelier 14 years and all others so kind and welcoming, professional on a level to best those at the Wynn!",

The decor was cute as well.  Very romantic setting.  Order the prime rib, it was the best I have ever had.  This is a great place for any sort of celebration or romantic evening. Thanks Hugos for an unforgettable experience!",

    "text": "Eat anything from menu and you will love it!  Best food & service ever!!!!!!!!!!!  Okay so let me just start off by saying if you like going to fufu restaurants because they are the \"it\" restaurant at the moment...or maybe hip because celebrities are going to them (like BOA) then this isn't the restaurant for you. It is not hip and trendy in any sense of the word, more like on the dated side which makes it in my eyes old school Vegas and on the hipster side.  So anyways...ambiance aside. It still is a great place for a date. They hand each woman a rose at entry..little cheesy but I like it :). Like I said the restaurant is a little retro , if you go on their website even the one picture they have up is dated. Don't let that stop you from going to Downtown Vegas though. The food is nothing short of amazing,  You can have a five course meal here if you choose but with any entree they start you off with a salad. They waiter will pull of salad cart and have you personally choose what you want/don't want in your custom salad...and get this, if you don't like salad dressing options they can create one for you. Love it!!!!!!!!   After you custom made salad you get a lemon/ lime sorbet in a tiny ice cream cone to cleanse the pallet.  After that your food (great portions not too small or too much) and anything you order will be DE-LISH.   As if that were not enough they bring you a platter of assorted chocolate dipped fruit & dried fruit with their very own in house made TO DIE FOR whip cream. I am not a whip cream fan at all and the whip cream they served was beyond beyond words.   By the end of that you really won't have much room for dessert but if you do they are good as well. I've had the creme brulee and its silky and yummy.  The service is top notch, food is great...if you go make sure you make reservations. I've been there a bunch of times and the earlier you go the better...when there are big parties there they don't manage as well. It is a hidden gem that mostly on locals know about so I am so glad I found out about it.  I have had thoughts of just flying out to Vegas just for dinner there, that's how much I heart this place.  If you go, enjoy!",

Amazing table side salad service, the best dirty martini in town (more like 3 servings) and perfectly cooked steak and the best king crab legs I have ever had.  They had chocolate dipped fruit for dessert included with the meal and raspberry sorbet between courses.  Our waiter has been there 20+ years and he was very polite and knowledgeable.  I can't wait to go back!",

The staff was friendly enough, but they need more training to pull off a high quality experience.  They were Denny's quality servers. Took a lot of the romance and fun out of it.  Also we were quoted \"policy\" that we order appetizer and meal at the same time.  A clear effort to turn over tables quickly.  Similarly priced places would never do this.",

I was given a long stem rose and we were led to our table.  Our team of waiters (Rashad and Victor) we're friendly and professional.  We started with a half bottle of wine delivered by the sommelier.  Very classy!  Then after ordering the show began, Victor brought the salad cart and expertly made our salads to order with some laughs and stories.  He is a riot and makes damn fine salads.  Next Rashad delivered raspberry sorbet to cleanse the palette before our dinner arrived.  I had the Hugo's Chicken and he had the Beef Wellington.  Both were perfectly executed.  We couldn't have been more pleased.  I got a pic of every course except the complimentary dessert tray.  It was exquisite with chocolate covered apricots, strawberries and figs with whipped cream.  We had a wonderful dining experience and were so glad for our taxi driver's recommendation.",

No problem on the wait, but we just wanted some appetizer or something to munch on because my friend is diabetic and he needed to eat something small right away to balance his blood sugar.  I waited patiently as the bartender tended to one waiter after another.  I finally asked him for some cheese and crackers and he totally ignored me.  The hostess knew that I was getting hot and she sat us right away.  Now I don't know the intricacies of the food industry.  But apparently, this place does everything the old school way and they do it top notch.  I had to listen to my friend describe how a butter rose was made, how time consuming it was to make a good bordelaise sauce, and how the napkin under the creme brulee was a difficult fold to make.  I was still pissed about the bartender ignoring me.  Plus, I question whether or not they got my order correct.  I ordered the rib eye steak medium rare.  There wasn't much marbling on the steak and it looked and tasted more like the NY strip.  Value-wise, this place is fantastic.  Most other nice restaurants would have all the dishes a-la-cart.",

    "text": "Simply the best. Best quality of food. We always order out steak rare at most medium rare and it's hard to get somewhere that can make it right. Well Hugo's Cellars is the best place for steak, service, and a must for a trip to Vegas. From the moment we walked in my wife received a rose and staff was more than helpful friendly staff at a restaurant they set the standards on what service should be. Honestly they raise the bar a few notches. Appetizers were great bread with rose butter so good. Main entrees were beyond delicious. Out steak was not over or under cooked which is easily done when ordering a rare steak they do not make any mistakes on food. This review still cannot serve this place justice they are incredible hands down. Oh and VICTOR, he just made it for us he was not our waiter or the manager he was the salad guy he will make your night and the experience very conversational never misses a beat his personality made our entire Vegas trip the best. If you make a reservation and have never been there before request Victor just going to Hugo's cellar is awe inspiring and an experience to remember but having Victor is truly what makes it the best. Must go there is a reason they have great reviews. The price yes it is higher priced so if your looking for a low priced meal it's not here. We spent $160 for 2 steak dinners and drinks. It was our anniversary so they brought a a special desert at no charge. I in no way regret spending the amount we did on dinner the food quality shows why and the service is unlike anywhere else we have EVER BEEN.",

My husband and I consider ourselves foodies having eaten in some of the best places in the world and I am a difficult critic.    That's why I was so surprised at our experience last night at this old downtown classic.   We Were greeted at the door with a rose. An empty bud vase was waiting on the table for it and before we left the restaurant the waiter had wrapped it to go for me.  The vodka cocktail my husband ordered came with its own chilling bin in a carafe. Elegant old style to the max.  The menu also is elegant old style classics that I don't know why they ever went out of style Reasonable prices and everything is included including the sorbet between courses and a finish with chocolate covered strawberries, figs, and dates with cream to dip. The beef Wellington was perfect as were the mash potatoes and al dente veggies.  Service was impeccable.   Definately a redo and let's keep it a secret so it doesn't get too busy",

My husband and I are foodies and love to try new places - high and low-end - and Hugo's takes the cake for the best service anywhere. We dined in on a short trip to Vegas after reading great reviews. The menu is pricy but so much is included. A $53 filet also comes with mashed potatoes, vegetables, bread, salad, and sorbet in between. This is a steal in an expensive town like Las Vegas. The salad is prepared table-side, which is a very cool experience! I'd recommend their house orange vinaigrette. We were served by Carlos and Victor - great guys with lovely personalities and an unparalleled dedication to Hugo's patrons.   The food I'd rank a 4.5, just because we've had slightly better steak in our hometown of Houston. The lobster bisque is to die for.   Overall, fabulous fabulous place with an excellent atmosphere, interesting history, exceptional service, and delicious food. Enjoy!",

Think close booths with pretty light fixtures, dim lighting, people's heads huddled together, soft whispers. It's that kind of place. You want to come with a significant other and have long three hour dinners.   First, it's away from the Strip and somewhat hidden as a basement restaurant (converted from a wine cellar from back in the days) so you automatically feel a little special. The service is impeccable - old school charm meets modern dining, like free salad (!) and a complementary light sorbet afterwards to cleanse your palette.   Most memorable attribute? Guys - they give a long stem red rose to EVERY female patron, saving you the need to buy her flowers yet giving you all the perks of a romantic evening! How much better does it get??",

The waiters are all very professional and highly educated when it comes to their menu and wine selections!   The food is out of this world! Steak, seafood, and poultry options are all fantastic--I have never had a bad meal at Hugo's!

It's quiet even though it's right next to the casino - the only complaint I had about this is that due to the smell of the smoke from the casino, it seemed like they were overcompensating with some sort of air freshener to get rid of the smoke smell.  This just resulted in a mixture of perfumed smoke smell in the entryway/bar of the restaurant.  The dinner we had was very good - we mostly opted for steaks, but the fish I had was done perfectly.  However, our waiter was just running through the motioned and you could definitely tell he was bored and did not want to be there.  That definitely put a downer on our experience there.  Not sure we would visit again.",
