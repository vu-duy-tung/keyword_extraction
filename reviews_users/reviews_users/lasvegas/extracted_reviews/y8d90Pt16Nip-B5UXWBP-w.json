I forget the steak over mashed potatos name but it was overcooked too  Service was very good. Waitress was there to explain everything and very nice",

First they have new additions to their happy hour menu so I had to try it. We ordered poke nachos, spinach dip, chicken tenders, and of course chicken lettuce wraps. Can I just say the poke nachos are ridiculously delicious the poke was so fresh it melted like butter in my mouth the seaweed flakes and white truffle sauce is amazing. The chicken tenders with fries was amazing the tenders were some of the best we've had eating out you can tell they are homemade. Spinach dip was so good with burnt cheese around the edges yummmm and of course the chicken lettuce wraps I always order never disappoint. Also our server Amanda was so nice and attentive can't wait to come back!",

The only reason I can't give a review of 3 or less stars is because the hostess' give an accurate wait time which as someone who has been one, that is important. Also, the food is just good!   I really hate bad service, I have been here for nearly 10 minutes and yet, no service! I shouldn't have to make eye contact. I should be served. Headed to the table now. Every time I Come here the bartenders tends to be egotistical and don't care.   Went to the host stand and they didn't smile! It took a second person to finally bring on the happiness! After a second wait, I was taken to a bar table!? Wtf!? Did I ask to be set at a high top? No! I  wasn't asked and I have an elderly person with me. This establishment has really gone downhill.",

They told me that there is a 30 minute window to accommodate such a big group. I told them that would be fine. When we arrived the manager, Hope, told me they were almost ready. Just waiting on one table to clear to extend our spot. We waited a bit but the table just wouldn't leave. We went ahead and sat down anyway to start the celebrations. Shortly after appetizers the table finally moved. The waiter quickly set up our extension and we had plenty of room. Then Hope sent over complimentary dessert for our patience. She was great. Totally on top of it. Thanks again. Great place to eat.",

After a while some people showed up but she handled the bulk of  everything by yourself.  I had the steak medium rare to say it was cooked deliciously would not do it's due respect.

I had a bowl of the French onion soup, a baba fish taco and a beef short rib taco.  The soup was okay but the tacos were awful.  The family liked the fried calamari appetizer but the lobster, artichoke dip was not good.  We also had the chicken penne pasta and the Vodka shrimp pasta.  Not great.  The best thing the whole night was the Moscow mule!  Definitely get one of those.  I won't come back for the food but the drink was really, really good!!

My husband ordered the baja fish tacos that came with the rice and beans. It was just \"alright.\" He barely touched the rice and literally took 2 spoons of the beans and then was finished. My garlic lobster noodle dish was great. It had perfect portion of seafood and noodles. I ended up getting full from the appetizers however, so my husband finished the rest of my plate. He found it tasty as well. We ordered the chocolate souffle, which was just okay. I have had better. It would be 4 stars, but I took off a star because our server was not friendly at all. She seemed to be mad at us, when we were not being difficult. I work in a restaurant, I understand how annoying it is to have difficult customers. She was not very friendly and was not helpful. I don't know if Jessica was having a bad day, but I hope she doesn't treat all customers like that.",

One hostesses said, \"I'm sorry that was a mistake.\" To which my fiance replied, \"what was?\"  Then two women behind he counter decided to become some sort of Anti-costumer employees and said, \"UM WE BUZZED YOU 6 minutes ago, and after three minutes we go to the next person.\"   Ok couple things. 1) only buzzed once. 2) you work in a service industry. So did I got a long LONG time. Never once have I considered be so disrespectful, even to the MOST miserable costumer. However, Yardhouse seems to employee women who get to determine who lives and who dies, or so they seemed on their high horse.   Too bad. Just spent about 60$ at Lucills.

    "text": "Saturday night and we had plans to meet another couple at Yard House for dinner and drinks.  We were seated right away at a high top table close to the bar and kitchen entrance.  Pretty busy area to say the least.  We were greeted by a nice young guy to take our drink orders.  We all ordered beer.  My girlfriend and I always order Coors Light and Bryce (our server) gave us a hard time being that we were at the \"Yard House\" ordering a domestic beer. haha  He recommended the light beer which I went with and I must say it was pretty darn good.  My BF on the other hand ordered a raspberry beer (a girly foofoo beer I guess. haha).  With that said, it was the focus on the rest of the night because our dear server Bryce was not going to let him live that down.  (read on)  As we went over our menus Bryce brought the BF a kids menu (hence the beer reference).  So you know its going down at this point.  It's on son! LOL  That followed by a straw in BF's beer when he wasn't looking...totally crackin-up-classic.  So silly.   VARIETY is where its at on this menu.  Huge assortments of food and drinks....what more could you want to satisfy a craving for a fab Saturday night out.  I had beer, sushi and Italian all in one sitting.  How's that for variety. Amen!  Run Down: Appetizer the California Roll: - It is huge, great to share, totally delish. It is literally  one piece of a sushi roll-but times 10 in size topped with snowcrab and avacado...a definite must try. Me - Penne with chicken, mushrooms, asparagus, sundried tomatoes in a cream sauce - Never ever a disappointment (definitely not a dish for the diet) BF - Orange Peel Chicken - Total Yum.  He gets it all the time and loves it.  To end the meal Bryce brought over a to-go kids cup in case BF wanted to take his drink with him (not for real because Im not sure you can do that). haha  What a delight Mr. Bryce was.  He definitely has that something special to add to customer service.  I hope his manager takes notice!  We will be back hoping to get his table again.  Anyways, food and ambiance are always amazing.  They have a cool outdoor patio with TVs which is definitely fun watching your favorite teams play.  Anything we have ordered on this menu has been consistently perfect.  I do think that the mac&cheese is one of my favorite dishes and the hummus is yummy too.  The service is always good.  This is a regular stop for us and we will be back soon for sure.  My stomach is growling just thinking about it....hey it is FRIDAY!!! ;)",

He was very knowledgeable and helpful with us in navigating the large menu. They have a ridiculous amount of beer on tap and I had two of Stevens suggestions that were fantastic.  The food is where the experience lacked a bit. I ordered a steak salad as I wasn't too hungry my wife got the filet. Both were over cooked even though I ordered med rare and my wife medium. Both steaks were med well, but since we aren't too picky we ate them without complaint. They were OK. Honestly nothing special but good.  The Desert trio souffles were delicious and we left satisfied with our New Years eve dinner. We for sure will be back in the future.",

There are TVs outside and fire elements along with heaters. We sat here and had good food and service. We started with one waiter who ended up being sent home  early because the place was not busy. Our replacement servers of a waiter and a trainee were very friendly and helpful as well. We shared the summer salad which was very good. I also enjoyed the jambalaya. With this dish you are given the option of three types of carbs for it to be based on - I chose brown rice. This is a beer lovers place - lots of drafts in big glasses.",

He remembers us and goes out of his way to make us (especially my daughter) feel special.  He checks in often, remembers our favorites, gives prompt service, we cannot say enough good things about him.  We went to lunch yesterday and were excited to see he was working and we got to sit in his section.  I have no idea what was goo on but shortly after we were seated and had our drinks delivered Steven was literally fired right at our table!  We sat there in shock, my daughter got upset because she didn't know what was going on, and we decided to leave after seeing that.  We cannot support an establishment that treats their staff that way!  There is no reason Steven should have been told \"Get off my floor, you're fired!\"  In front of us! I'm appalled, horrified, and I don't want to go back.  The entire experience was shocking.  We went to a different restaurant while trying to rationalize a situation I don't even understand to my five year old daughter.",

    "text": "I'm not a beer drinker but I've been here many times over the past year, mainly for the happy hour (half price on appetizers and discounted drinks) and have enjoyed each visit.  If you are a beer lover, this place is for you.  There are over 100 beers from which to choose, all excellent and worthy of serious consideration, according to my husband, a huge beer lover.  The food is great and consistently well done.  Menu choices include  ethnic-inspired dishes (Korean short ribs, noodle dishes), burgers, seafood, and steak.  On this visit, I had the turkey burger, which is one of the better ones I've had anywhere.  Even without cheese (I'm allergic to dairy), the burger had loads of flavour and was moist.  The accompanying fries were thinly sliced and abundant.  My husband had the full rack of St. Louis ribs and the meat literally fell off the bone.  Each rib had plenty of meat and the bbq sauce was spicy and tasty.  Hubby's sides were a lovely serving of cilantro infused baked beans and creamed corn, the latter of which featured \"a ton of butter and cream\" (sayeth the spouse).  We both finished half of our meals and are looking forward to tomorrow's lunch.  For dessert, I chose the mini peach-apple cobbler (ice cream on the side and happily consumed by hubby) and it was warm and full of fruit.  The size of the dessert was perfect: just enough to satisfy, not too much to sicken.  :)    Yard House would garner 5 stars from me if the servers displayed consistent service.  Some days, my server is awesome, not too attentive but just enough, courteous and charming, and nailing every dining request I may have.  Other times, I'll see the server two times, the first time to take the order and the second time to bring the cheque.  Today's server was good and would rate an 8.5 (she remembered that my turkey burger was supposed to be cheeseless but forgot to include my garlic aioli sauce on the side).    All in all, overall great food and decent service.  I always have a good time when I go and it's one of my go-to places for a fun time.",

    "text": "This past Friday, I called the Red Rock Yard House to make same day reservations for a group of 12 at 4:30 pm, for the Bar Area. Many of the group hadn't seen each other since last summer. The hostess readily accommodated my request. I arrived at 4 pm and was pleasantly surprised that our table was ready and waiting. But by 5 pm, our little group of 12 grew into a rather large group of 16. We asked the manager if it would be possible to to obtain another hi-top table to fit our new arrivals. The wait staff and supervisors quickly obtained another table, greeted our new additions, took their orders without missing a beat; and made us all feel welcome.   The entire evening went extremely well, everyone commented to me how much fun they had and how attentive our servers were. I don't recall the names of those two outstanding servers. But, they seemed to know when and what we needed ahead of our numerous and varied requests. When the Bar Area got really busy, several other servers readily stepped in to assist our servers and keep our party going with quiet efficiency.  Several of our friends had mentioned prior to arriving for the party, that the Yard House would be far too busy to accommodate our group and that I should consider relocating the group to Lazy Dog's for our celebration. I'm definitely glad that I didn't change our venue. I didn't get to thank all the staff involved but they did a exceptional job during a very busy evening.  If you are planning to entertain at the last minute, I would definitely consider contacting the amazing folks at the Yard House Red Rock!!",

This location seems to be somewhat quieter than the other two in Las Vegas which makes conversation a bit easier. They have great placement of TVs so you can sneak peaks at the games and not seem rude to the people in your party. The food is always stellar. My favorite is the ginger crusted salmon with wasabi mash potatoes. Delicious! Our server Brandi went out of her way to take amazing care of us. She even held on to my To Go box until we were done walking around Red Rock casino and ready to leave. There is abundant parking and it is very easy to get in and out of the restaurant considering it's in a casino.  The selection of beers is amazing and they have a good wine menu too. Always a great experience!",

Then I went on several dates to the restaurant under the pretense that it was such a good place to eat, casual, fun and delicious. Recently I went to the one at Red Rock Casino, as it is near to my house in Summerlin. We had to most delightful waitress and staff that I have had in a restaurant in a long time. Super friendly and accommodating. We tried several beers before we made our choices and were not charged for any of them, until we got a tall glass and stuck with that for the night. We then ordered the Spinach Cheese Dip and I have to say, this is my new favorite appetizer here. Not only is it seasoned perfectly, the blend of cheese and spinach is exact and the accompanying flat bread crisps makes it the most wonderful and satisfying dish we had all night. Next time you visit the Yard House or Red Rock Casino, make sure to bring your appetite and try this amazing dish out for yourself. xoxo Haley",

She went above and beyond and was so friendly. She was a great server which made our evening great. She brought out a special \"congrats\" plate to my son which had just graduated high school. Then one of the people in my party mentioned to her that another person at the table was a having a birthday and she brought a special treat for him which was a total surprise. Everyone enjoyed the food and the service especially made for a great evening. When we go to that location again we will for sure ask for Chloe!!",

HAPPY HOUR PLEASE....although all we got from the HH menu was the onion rings.  WOOOWEEE.  Dallas was our server.  She was very awesome and patient with my soft speaking grandma and her bff.   We all got burgers, gram and Ms. S got theirs w/ the mixed fruit and dad and I got the French Fries.  Everything was super good except my bun was cold.  I wasn't expecting that and kinda threw me off but the burger and fries were piping hot. Ive been to Yard House several times but I think this is my first review.  Great place and tons of selection for beer.  Would definitely recommend!",

What she received was a medium rare burger with cheddar (or american).  Waiter sent it back and manager came out and apologized. Second time around the burger had the right cheese but was still blood red in all placed except the edges.  They need a new chef to cook burgers.  The place was not even that busy.  They did remove the burger from our bill.  Felt sorry for the waiter. The manager did not come back out after the second screw up.",

My wings took awhile to arrive, but the waiter made sure to take that off of the bill. The jerk sauce had a nice cardamom pineapple flavor, with a great finishing burn. The onion rings are nice and crispy encrusted with garlic.   The skinny margaritas were simple and traditional but strong enough to give you that happy hour feeling. Will definitely return soon for the great service and value, something you'll never find on the strip.",

The music brings you in with some classic rock (the good stuff). Our server Rodney was super awesome the same time. He explained the wings perfectly (even though I had a lot of questions for just wings). But boy when these came out. I sure was happy. You get 10 for only $6. The Buffalo is tangy and a perfect combo for a HH cocktail. My bf got the skinny margarita (x2) and I tried the new blackberry smash. It was sweet and tart but good for a summer afternoon. My bf got the earthy and robust choice of the Jerk sauce. The service was excellent. They took care of us really well. My BF even said we have to come here more often for Happy hour.",

    "text": "I was truly blown away by this particular yard house inside the red rock Hotel in Las Vegas. The first thing that stood out was that even though they were in a gambling casino they did not give priority to high rollers and even though I am a highroller I love the fact that they were so cool about that and handed me a beeper and said it would be a 20 minute wait.  Instead of waiting we found two seats at the bar and they were able to make me an ice cream drink with vodka Kahlua and cream de coco and only one in 20 bars will do that for me. And it was perfect.  The Caesar salad and guacamole and chips were awesome and came promptly to the table. My best friends meal was great and my turkey pot pie could not have been better  Even though the place was packed we were not rushed and were able to hang out for about 90 minutes at the bar chatting with others and just having a good time.  The vibe at most Yard Houses I have visited is high energy and very loud but this one was a lot more sane.  I would strongly recommend you give it a try when you are in Las Vegas because they don't allow smoking and as you know if you eat in a casino your clothes smell like smoke for weeks.",

The sliders are always moist with bits of carrots in it and mozzarella topped on the meat. The chicken nachos has fake cheese, real cheese, large chunks of meat and of course the beans, sour cream and guacamole on top. It's loud enough that when you bring kids it's not a big deal either. Their menu is so huge that you can easily find something for everyone!  Also, the HH is NOT limited to the bar. That's a big plus because sometimes there is no room at the bar and it is nice that they include all patrons for this awesome deal.  Overall since its a chain restaurant there is plenty of service even when it's happy hour. We've always left happy and I love that YH is that much closer.",

I normally get my sliders and my partner gets the spinach dip and whatever else. This time, same thing yet it took an hour to get our food. We were treated by the servers assistant because she was on her break. She never came to the table to take our order because the assistant did.  We got the spinach dip and drinks and waited roughly 45 minutes for our food... When we asked our server where our food was, the order had never actually been put in. She gave us the biggest attitude. Now it's HAPPY HOUR finally yet we arrived an prior to it.... and our order is finally being put in. We get our food 10 minutes later and start to eat. We ask for our check and end up waiting til we are done eating and then some.... so we walked up to the hostess stand. Dallas comes back our table surprised that we left, so she heads over to stand we are at with an attitude and hands us the check. She DIDN'T even give us the happy hour pricing...  We'll just choose another place to eat from now on our weekly date nights. That wasn't right.",

    "text": "Disgusting cockroach that was a huge three inches was running around!! (See photo) I rated the other Yard House at the Linq 5 stars. The food at this location was just as delicious, but what came down to the one star was the nasty huge bug at the end.  We ordered our food as usual, but we came towards closing so they were starting to close the restaurant. The door says last call is around 1am, but our server took last call for us around 11:30pm.  As we were finishing our meal, the restaurant turned the lights on brighter as they were closing. The huge cockroach then came out and was running around near our booth.  All of the food was delicious but seeing an insect around where we are sitting made me feel truly disgusting. It was probably at our feet the whole time we were eating and we would have no idea because it is so dim. It makes me consider the cleanliness of not only this location, but the other Yard Houses.  I told the manager and she just stepped on it and said \"thank you for telling me.\" She wasn't even surprised to see such a huge bug. They probably frequently have a cockroach problem and this was nothing new for her.  Also, the only thing we drank was water. The first two cups I had tasted normal, but when they were basically closed and refilled it, it tasted off. The water had a nasty taste to it. This location (and maybe the others) was really dirty. Im disappointed to not be coming back even after the food and service was nice.",

A server who told us he is slamming the kitchen because he was slammed by tables. 40 min for salad and chix sandwiches. Salad arrived soggy, wet, but amazingly enough the chicken was dry, burnt and tasteless.  Add to the joy, the fans and misters were off. When I asked why, I was told they were broken. 5 min after complaining to the manager, fans and misters are turned on.  How hard is it to provide consistent food and service. It's literally the backbone of all successful restaurants. Clearly, Yard House isn't successful",

    "text": "I always think of the Yard House as a bar with good music and decent burgers. But I've been really impressed with this location, both from the service and food standpoint.  As I said, the burgers are decent, but I've tried some other menu items, like the stacked chicken enchilada, and they been pretty tasty as well! What I really like is that the quality of the food they're using is excellent.  Another interesting thing to note about the Yard House, at least this location, is that they have an excellent kid's menu. This hadn't been a concern to me in the past, but with a 9 year old stepson now, I find myself sometimes seeking out places that are kid-friendly. Who'd have though that the Yard House would be one of the best options for kids? Not only do they have a huge selection (for a kid's menu, relatively speaking), but they offer decent portion sizes and, of course, good food quality.  Perhaps I'm biased because I go way back with the Yard House. I remember when they opened their first location (and I loved the concept at the time). And I remember when they began to expand. Though I'm not necessarily a big fan of chains, the Yard House deserves its success, and I'm glad to see them maintaining great quality.  If you're near Red Rock and looking for a good place to eat, the Yard House won't let you down.",

We came in on a whim with a gift card and were pleased to see that it was happy hour. The three of us shared the fried mac n cheese, deep fried cheese curds, and BBQ chicken pizza. I also had the California roll and my BIL had the ahi sashimi. The California roll is actually more of a \"stack\" or layered sushi as opposed to a traditional roll. It's my favorite dish and always a good choice. I really enjoyed the fried man & cheese as well. The marinara sauce was good but the other one seemed to be some sort of mushroom sauce-pass on that one. My BIL and husband each had (and devoured) the creme brulee while I opted for the apple peach cobbler. My dessert was delicious. Our server was initially Anna who got us drinks and then turned us over to Chad at shift change. They were both awesome-Chad checked on us a ton and never let our drinks get low. Overall it was another awesome meal at Yard House-and we'll definitely be back!",

The manager was really understanding and made me what I actually ordered, I went to go pick it up and they gave it to me no charge for the inconvenience. The manager's kindness really made my day. Thank you for the great customer service.",

This Yard House location is at the North side of the Red Rock Casino right next to Lucille's. They have a huge dining area that includes outdoor seating. There is also a nice sized bar with a great selection of beer and cocktails.  I have been there several times and I have not had a bad experience ever. The burgers, apps, steaks, and salads are all very good. I was actually surprised how good the NY Strip was the first time I ordered it there.  I definitely recommend stoping in to the Yard House.",

Service has never been exceptionally good but not bad either.   Tonight was the worst meal we've ever had and we won't be returning.    Sat down pretty easily in the patio on a beautiful Vegas evening.  One of my sons ordered a kids pepperoni pizza with a side of mashed potatoes.  That was tasty.    My other son ordered an adult mac and cheese.  That was decent.    My wife ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and she really enjoyed it.    I ordered the bacon cheeseburger.  That was okay.  Way too much bbq sauce all over the plate.  I had a side ranch salad that was flavorless and soggy.  The worst was the penne pasta that my teenage son ordered.  It was awful.  Flavorless.  We told the server and she said she would bring more sauce because the kitchen probably didn't put enough sauce on it.    Personally I would've just taken it off the menu and replaced that entree.    Probably the worst thing that happened was when a different server brought a clam chowder to our table.  When he dropped the soup off, he also placed an order of fries on our table that was supposed to go to another table.  My 6-yr old didn't realize that and grabbed a fry.  The server saw that, grabbed the little bowl of fries, and took it to the table that it was supposed to go.  That's just weird.  I left a 15% tip and wrote a note to the server that she should've removed the dish that we barely ate.  Poor service = lower tip for the server and no return visit to the restaurant.    Too many options in Summerlin to waste money here.",

Ordered lettuce wraps to start, they came out with our meal, no biggie.  Bartender was attentive and the place was very clean.  My only issue with this place is the nutrition.  Unlike Cheesecake they do not have a low-cal section of their menu. I was remiss to find out their Turkey burger, yes turkey, has well over 70 grams of fat.  If you go to their homepage you can find the nutrition facts.  They have several meals with over 100 grams of fat, no kidding!  They also have a nice lunch section of more moderately priced items.",

We sat at the bar area and ordered Tomato Bisque, sliders, Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Blueberry, and a Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat. I really love their tomato bisque. It is organic (not a big deal), topped with a fried basil leaf, creamy, and oh soo flavorful. Even though it isn't on the happy hour menu, I always get it because I'm addicted! The Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Blueberry was pretty good. I'll admit, I don't drink beer very often at all, but once in a while I like to try something new and I was surprised at how much it really tasted like blueberries. It was almost like having blueberry soda with a mild taste of beer. I highly recommend it if you don't really love the taste of beer very much because the blueberries cover it up a lot. The Tangerine Wheat was a little too bitter for my taste (think tangerine peels), but my friend thought it was refreshing. The sliders are a great deal at just under 7 bucks for three sliders and a good amount of fries. I didn't get it this time, but I usually get the Bearnaise sliders. They also have Ahi sliders, but they're a few bucks more.  Overall, I had a good experience at this location. It wasn't too noisy or crowded and the service was very fast.",

Food: The foods alright, yard house isn't really known for their food mostly for their wide range of beers. I've never eaten and entree but this place is pretty pricey. I usually grab a snack like Shrimp Ceviche or chips salsa and guacamole.  Drinks/Beer: Yard house is known for its alcohol, I've never tried one of their specialty drinks but I'm not much of a mixed drink girl. BUT the BEER oh the beer, wow they have a lot to choose from every time I go I try to get something different. They even have yard house craft beers.   Customer Service: The service was nice our waitress was sweet but the place was kind of rowdy. Even for afternoons or evenings, so if your planning to have a romantic dinner don't go here.   Happy Hour: The happy hour here is pretty decent, its from Monday - Friday 3pm - 6pm Sunday - Wednesday 10pm - Close half off pizza's and appetizers are the best part and the drinks",

Whether you like a fruity blueberry brew or a manly dark, rich stout... this place has you covered.   The food on the other hand is nothing that tasty.  This place is TGI McFunster, with a better beer menu.  That's not really a complaint, just a note.  I love the beers!  I really do.  And there is nothing wrong with a big chain restaurant burger or chicken fingers.  Just don't come expecting more than that.  The menu is too big for any decent kitchen to put out.  Expect mass produced entrees with plenty of frozen and deep fried boredom.  I know what you are going to say.... they have a Vegetarian menu... they have exotic dishes.  Well  I am forever unimpressed with these special menus. Remember the ingredients here are falling off the same US Foods or Sysco truck as the burgers.  There is no brilliant young chef in the back struggling to express himself with his unique cuisine.  These are corporate recipes on menus meant to suck the dollars from your wallet.  In the end, they probably hope you drink enough beer to forget the food.  So don't kid yourself into believing that the ingredients are anything extraordinary.    On the good side...  the food is not bad and the beer is noteworthy.  In proper combination this can result in a nice, fun dinner.  If that is your expectation... you are in luck.  I like this place, but I just don't see it as anything particularly unique or special.   Welcome America to yet another TGI McFunster Exotic Brew Garden and Neighberhood-like pub.",

Wait some more, another 10 minutes before our the  beer arrives! 20 minutes so far. Now this is a Weds night, not on a weekend.  Did I mention I miss the great servers they used to have? I am writing this while we wait for our food. Server then comes by and says she thinks the wrong food was ordered.... ugghhh. Then bf's food arrives but no lettuce wraps for me...waiting... his food getting cold while he waits politely for my food to appear. I used to love it here! Why did some big company have to buy them and drive out the good service?  Finally 35 minutes after being seated I get my food. But has anyone asked if we would like a refill on our beer? No.... food is still pretty ok and beer selection is great. Got the servers attention to order beer and dessert, whew! Server that delivered BFs beer is one of the veterans... he's like hey! Where have you guys been! We tell him about our last couple visits, much like this one...  yeah we used to love it here...",

Probably won't go back because it's overpriced and wasn't that good. The waitress was kind of rude too. Reason why they are getting 2 stars is because at least they had a lot of beer selections",

I was so caught up in the moment and watching football that I kept forgetting to take pictures.  Some of the food we ordered was; pepperoni mushroom pizza, pepperoni pizza, seared ahi sashimi X2, poke nachos, chicken nachos, chicken lettuce wraps, lumpia X3, fried Mac and cheese sticks X3, and Kung pao calamari! - we ordered more but everything was coming and going so fast didn't get pictures.   I would also like to give a HUGE shout out to our Amazing waitress Tosha . Our drinks were never empty, she was constantly checking on us, bringing food in and taking finished plates away. Mind you we were a party of 10 & the place was JAM PACKED. She deserves more then 5  for her amazing service.",

    "text": "This Yard House is located inside Red Rock Casino (my favorite casino). Good food, great atmosphere and the service is always amazing. It's fancy enough to celebrate special occasions but also laid back enough to just hang out with friends/coworkers after work. Lots of TVs and loud tunes playing in the background. You can walk in and grab a seat at the bar or wait to be seated. They offer inside or outside patio. I actually prefer the patio to dine al fresco. It's quite comfortable, they come prepared with heat lamps or misters depending on the season.   They're well known for their excellent beer selection (you'll see all the kegs as you walk in) and if you're brave enough try \"The Yard\". Not to mention the Martinis! I live for these! Try the Strawberry Fields and thank me later! HH menu has a great selection too. What to expect: burgers, pizza, wings, pasta...the typical american fare. But there's also the unexpeced items which I especially like. For instance, the mushroom lettuce wraps and jambalaya. Mmmm. This is one chain restaurant that shouldn't be overlooked.",

I was sitting at the bar (because they don't have other table available). I ordered food with non alcoholic drink, the guy at the bar asked for my ID, which is ok. I gave him my passport, he took so long to find my date of birth, I show him where my date of birth on the passport, he said he have to show it to his manager, he said it's their company policy. He took my passport away, out of my sight for 10mins, who know what he did to my passport. If his purpose is to check my date of birth, I'm surprise he couldn't read number and English by himself.  Because of this stupid company policy I never want to go back to this restaurant again.  By the way, sitting at the bar is not so nice because this drain thingy smell like vomit.",

I get the same thing almost every time I come, the orange chicken and when I received it this time, it was half the normal portion I always get. There were only 3 or 4 small little pieces of chicken on the plate and a scoop of rice. Where did the rest of my meal go, because I certainly didn't get it? They sat us out on the patio because that was the only seating they had available and it took forever to even get our waiter to come out to us. We were left with empty glasses constantly and food took quite a while to get.  Then after we left, we got to the car and my boyfriend realized that he had forgotten his sunglasses and hat on the table. He ran back to get them and every person that said that they would go check the table, ask our waiter if he saw them or get a manager for us, decided to go in the back and then go back to waiting on their tables. Nobody came to update us on if they had them or not for 15 minutes. Finally, he went back and started looking around himself until he found a manager. With all the staff that was standing around, someone could've helped him.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with my husband and kids while on family date night! Usually we frequent the Yard House that is located in town square so this was to be a refreshing change of atmosphere with the same great food!   Upon arrival, we were greeted and told that there would be a 30 min wait. The wait wasn't a big deal because they have a really nice waiting area out front with shade and cool sights! The buzzer went off with 5 mins to spare for us to order from the happy hour menu and the server was awesome about taking our order immediately!!   The kids chose their favorites calamari, pepperoni pizza, and fries! Hubs had the buffalo bites and steak sandwich and I chose to order my favorite blue crab cakes and copy his steak sandwich order because I didn't want to keep asking to bite his food.   The calamari was perfect! Crispy, chewy, and just perfect... to the kiddos it's considered the best in town! The pizza was pizza! Not amazing, but again it was for the kids! The fries. This time the fries were a bit off, I'm guessing because I had to request them ( they'd forgot to bring them) that I'd gotten a flash fried order was the reason they were a tad limp.. or maybe because they were swamped.  On to the adult meal. My blue crab cakes were meh today! Crispy on the outside but the inside as well as the sauce was cool. I can only assume they were done before the rest of food was the reasoning behind this travesty! I will admit the flavor was delicious.. and I know it would have been an a+ if it was hot! The steak sandwiches were a visit saving dish!! It corrected all previous wrongs and just made everything right! Cooked medium, the garlic aioli, the onion strings, and the au jus were all on point! It was so filling and I practically forced myself to finish it!  Overall im satisfied, we are a large family of 6 and most nights I barely get food out piping hot! As long as my kids left happy I'm happy!",

Service was slow, they are always busy so we enjoyed a leisurely dinner, & weren't in a rush.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of Yard House:  here in Las Vegas and at several other locations I've visited.  This review is focused on the Las Vegas location at Red Rock Casino in Summerlin.  I haven't tried anything I don't like on the menu and no matter what kind of beer I'm in the mood for, they'll have something to satisfy.  The menu has something for everyone, and the beer selection is even bigger!  I love that they also have \"chalkboard beers\"--special or seasonal brews that they don't usually carry, but that they have on-hand for a short time.  Be sure to ask what they are since the list changes often.  The waitstaff has always been top notch:  friendly, fast and willing to spend time chatting about their favorite beers and food on the menu.  Food comes out hot and in good time, empty plates are taken away quickly, and your drink glass is never empty.  When we bring our young son, it seems they always find time to say hello to him specifically--a nice touch!  The atmosphere is a little dark, but not in a bad way, and while I wouldn't say the restaurant is loud, the noise level may bother folks with sensitive hearing.  This may be because it always seems to be fairly full.  Lunchtime is quieter, and on weekends you may have to wait to get seated.  There's also classic rock playing and it seems they've created a playlist full of all the hits!  Bottom line:  the Yard House is a rock solid choice for good food, good music and an upbeat atmosphere.  Gather your appetite and your friends and go:  it's that kind of place!",

I can do better from a can or a box of instant.

    "text": "So went there last night (a Thursday) around 6:30. Wasn't very crowded as I was able to find a seat at the bar after just half a lap around. Waiter was attentive and proactively asked me if I wanted a water while I decided on drink and dinner. That was great and I was pretty excited that the evening would include great service, great beer and great food. The beer is where things went very wrong (especially for a place that people go to to drink a large selection of high quality beer). I ordered the house Belgian Tripel...it was out. He said it would be 5-10 minutes and asked if I wanted something else in the meantime. I asked for a Delerium Tremens. It came out with a 1/4 inch head that disappeared to no head in about 5 seconds. There were no bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. As I watched my sad little beer wither before I even took one drink, I already knew there was a pretty major CO2 problem because I immediately looked around and noticed that everyone else's beers also had no head - even the ones that had just just been poured like mine. I put it up to my lips and sure enough...probably about 10% carbonated compared to what it should have been. I told the bartender and he called over someone else, that person poured a small glass, tasted it and said...\"nope, it's fine\". I told bartender that it was not fine and I wanted another one. So he poured another and held the glass about two feet below the tap so it would create a bigger head. What...do you think I'm stupid? He gave me the beer and I watched the head disappear in 5 seconds. I told him it was also bad and I did not want it but that I would wait until the Tripel keg was changed. It got changed and he poured me the beer I'd been looking forward to all day...and it was as flat as a pancake too. I was super disappointed in the entire beer experience and didn't know why a bunch of people working in a place famous for beers were so ignorant of the product they were delivering. I travel to Vegas every other week and always stay at the Red Rock and always have at least one meal at The Yard House. Probably won't be my ritual any more.",

As for the prices, what can I say, I pay $4.00 for a gallon of gas. So of course I'll pay $7.00 for 12 ounces of imported beer. Especially if it's served with a smile.",

I immediately told the hostess I did not want to sit there, that I might as well sit outside.    At my new table Joseph C took my order and then came back to tell me he was going on a 10 minute break.  My meal was very good, but I quickly ran out of water.  Joseph C finally came back and did get me a refill of water.  Then he disappeared again.  I finally had to walk up to the side station and get my own water.  Another waitress came over and helped me.  She asked if I needed my waiter and I said no, I've been ignored my whole meal, why would I need him now?    So now Joseph C shows up from behind me and asks if I want some more water.  I said no, just the bill.  I love how he brings me the bill from behind so he doesn't have to face me again.  The restaurant was busy, but was well staffed.  I wouldn't show my face either if I had done such a terrible job ignoring one of my guests.  There was no reason to have such poor service.      So overall while the food was great, the front of the house staff really dropped the ball, leaving a bad taste in my mouth.  But with the money I saved on the no tip for Joseph C, I had some great ice cream at Ben & Jerry's.",

    "text": "Being a Las Vegas local, we have been to Yard House several times.  We usually go to the location on Las Vegas Blvd, but we had some family in town so we thought we would try the Red Rock location.  Needless to say the service was sooo horrible last night, my family and I will never be back to Yard House in the future.  Which is disappointing since we really enjoy the food & the atmosphere is nice.  Las Vegas is a service industry town, so you expect to get at least decent service... especially with soo many restaurant options.  I would not recommend anyone go to the Red Rock location.  We had a party of 8 so I understand sometimes there are challenges with larger parties but waiting an hour & a half just to get our food is a bit ridiculous.  Our beverages were empty most of the night, our server never checked on us and not once acknowledged the fact that we had waited sooo long to get our food.  We would try to get her attention and she would walk past us.  When our food finally did arrive, we had asked for a few items such as refills on beers & drinks as well as something simple like tarter sauce for the fish & chips... which our server never brought us.  At the end of the night we mentioned how unpleasant the service was to the manager and he didn't seem to care.  I guess they are not too concerned with making their customers happy.  This was by far the worst service I have EVER had.  Very unacceptable.",

    "text": "I've been to the Yard House a few time but this was the first time since I found out that the menu offered Gardein selections.  I'll breakdown our experience chronologically for fun.  We were seated and given our HUGE menus.  Seriously, they are huge, the size of a photo book, half of it listing the drinks.  We carefully reviewed the Gardein and other vegetarian and vegan options before I decided on the Firecracker Gardein Buffalo Wings and an order of Truffle Fries minus the Parmesan.  BF ordered the vegetarian mushroom and pepper street taco plater.  I ordered their house Blonde and he ordered the Sam Adams Octoberfest beer.  Beverages were delivered right away, but his was not correct.  A few minutes to get our server's attention for a correction but soon enough, the Octoberfest made its way to the table.  Shortly after that, the Buffalo Wings, Street Tacos & Truffle Fries are delivered and we are both dissappointed (but not surprised) by the small size of portions verses the large prices charged for them.    Truffle Fries - pretty good.  Served warm, nice seasoning, small hint of truffle oil and without the Parmesan as requested. Tacos - okay.  A few vegetables grilled on a flat top served on a 4 or 5 inch corn tortilla (seriously the smallest at the grocery store is 6 inches, can't that be the normal?) sloppily sprinkled with queso fresco.  Served with a scoop of rice that appeared to be seasoned but tasted blah and a small dish of undrained pinto beans topped with cheese.  Save the additional $2 or $3 dollars for the rice & beans and order the tacos ala carte. Buffalo Wings - fried goodness.  The coating was a nice balance to the chick'n inside and the sauce was flavorful.  Although, I'm not positive that I had the Firecracker sauce, rather than just a sweet tasting one.  It was not spicy at all.    Our server stepped away on break, but introduced us to her colleague but then we got thirsty.  Beverages were empty, several sightings of replacement server without inquiry about another round.  Stopped eating food so we could order another beverage but it took several more minutes.  Received another round, but wanted to get the check since the food prices were high and the beers were $6.50 each!  Can't afford to stay too long on those prices.  The check had the incorrect beer on it plus the 2 we each consumed.  Flagged down our server, and before I could say anything about the check, beer, extra charge, etc., she made mention of the extra beer and went to correct the check.  So...is that standard practice?  Not to remove a mistake and hope the guest does not review the bill?  Maybe she was psychic?  Sketchy.  $55.08 plus tip and that was all our wallets could stand.  Even if we never return I do not expect the Yard House's bottom line to be hurt, The place was super busy and was not slowing down as it approached dinner time.",

When we got there we were told there would be a 25 -30 minute wait although there were plenty of open tables on the patio.  We decided to stay and the 30 minute wait only ended up being like 10 minutes.  We were seated and then started checking out the menu.  Drinks were in order so we perused the drink menu, Our waiter came up and requested our drink order..  ::::::MAJOR PROPS:::::::  to our waiter for carding me and Michele- being ::cough::43::cough::  that was quite the ego boost!   and JD is kind of a beer connoisseur so he got some fancy schmancy kind of beer which I can't even remember the name of ... I decided on the Pear Cider.  Let me just clarify that I  my choice ROCKED!  It was light and delicious .. LOVED IT! Michele chose the Raspberry Cider and it was good too.  We all ordered and JD chose the southern fried chicken, Michele the parmesan crusted chicken and me ? I chose a turkey club sandwich with french fries.   Our meals came , and I was totally sad I did not get the southern fried chicken because it looked amazing! My meal looked amazing too so I really wasn't THAT sad. Michele was sad because he brought her the wrong dish. So she had to wait a little bit, I shared my fries in the mean time.  oh it was also a good reason for another pear cider.  JD ordered an Arrogant Bastard Ale.     Michele's meal finally came and she was excited to dig in, and it was delicious.  The portions were large so left overs were even better.   All in All a great meal.. just one star down for the wrong meal delivery...   Will definitley go back!",

It seems to me that the first time I just didn't have a good time or didn't order the right foods, but this time I really loved this place. First of all, we showed up for happy hour which was great. And this review might be a lot a review of their happy hour. My husband had a beer (Hefeweizen Dunkel) and I had a Gin and Tonic. They both were very good and the happy hour prices made me happy.   Move on to the food: We ordered three of their appetizers (they were all on their happy hour menu), the Ahi sliders, their traditional bone in wings, and the Hawaii Poke Stake. We really enjoyed all of those things and it really was plenty of food. The wings were actually ordered by my husband, but I ended up eating more than him. He loves his wings soaked in sauce whereas I like mine more dry. These were more on the dry side and super good. The Ahi Sliders came with a medium sized basket of thinly sliced potato fries. They were very good spiced and nice and crunchy. I ate so much of those I was getting almost sick. And the Poke Stake? Oh man, it was delicious.   Lesson learned: Always give places a second chance. This time it was really worth it.",

When we first moved to Vegas (about a year & a half ago) the only one in town was at Town Square - we were STOKED when the one at Red Rock opened up last summer in our neck of the woods!  How can you go wrong with amazing food and a fantastic beer selection?  Where else can you get a Young's Double Chocolate Stout and a Leffe, both on tap, at the same place?  I also like that I can try a new beer w/o having to pay for a whole glass.  They do tasters ($2?) that are a few sips, definitely more than a shot.  My favorite item on the menu (well - it's actually the ONLY item on the menu I've had, I ordered it my first time there, and can't bring myself to order anything else since) is the Blue Crab Cake Hoagie (hold the bacon) with fresh sliced avocado, tomato, and some really good remoulade/aioli dressing with shoe string fries.  mmm mmm mmm.  My fiance DIES for the rare Ahi Tuna sandwich - again, he ordered it the first time there and can't help but continue to order it every time we go.  We're actually planning on going back tonight, because it's hands down our favorite LV restaurant.  L O V E IT!  Oh and for my fellow vegetarians out there (yea I eat seafood - sue me), they have a whole section on the menu that they make w/ Gardein products.  While I haven't had any (can't say no to the crab cake) I have friends that have enjoyed it very much!",

I'll try a few other places before I go back, if I ever come back.  Food was nothing to come back for, and maybe other places will show the game.",

Everyone is normally happy with big smiles on their face except our waiter tonight Justin.  Sadly to say, our friend had to call over a manager to complain.  She was great and got it turned around to a much better situation. We normally wouldn't complain but with all four of us noticing the attitude in the first 10 minutes we just couldn't let it go.   Of course, the food was still great just took a while to get to us especially my drink which took about 25 mins. and it still didn't come out the way I requested it.  I know the restaurant was crowded so tried to take that into consideration but still the customer service should have been better.    Sorry Yard House you may need to be your own secret shopper.  =)",

The service has been above and beyond both times we were there. (Thanks to Stephen and Tom!) My husband loves their amazing beer selection, and I'll admit the lines of taps and the keg room is a sight. I've had the scallops and the cuban dip, both were dishes I'd recommend to anyone. I also appreciate the attention they pay to their \"kid\" guests. Yard House goes beyond the basic child food options, and the selection for them is nice. I look forward to my next trip to Yard House.",

    "text": "Unfortunately this place seems like one of those establishments that's generating so much business that they have employees drop the ball on customer service. My lady and I were actually excited to try YardHouse for the first time. The menu looked attractive and plus it's inside of my favorite casino resort Redrock Station. Unfortunately the experience was poor as soon as we walked through the door. We were first greeted by a gentleman that said we had to see somebody else to be seated. I really couldn't understand what he was saying. We ask him where do we go, and instead of him giving us proper directions or better yet walking us to where we needed to go, he just randomly pointed and stated \"down there\". So we decided we would figure it out and proceeded to walk, trying to stop someone for directions. Once we got to the waiting area we were told it's a 20 minute wait. The wait was more like 30 minutes but we were so excited to eat here we didn't mind at all. When we were finally taken to our seats our table was across from the kitchen directly in front of the main entrance. We definitely do not like trying to enjoy a meal with constant servers and customers passing us and hearing the commotion of the kitchen, so we asked to be seated at a booth, the young lady replied with broken english \"it's up to the boss\". My lady and I both looked at each other in disbelief. I was so shocked that I ask the server again and she actually said it again but this time with a long and awkward explanation. She took us back to the waiting area and it looked like the conversation she had with \"the boss\" seemed to irritate \"the boss\". \"The boss\", who's name tag read Allessa, was irritated to the point that she scratched our names from the top of the waiting list, put our names at the bottom and practically threw the pager at my lady with no eye contact or explanation as to what was going on. I ask her do we have to wait again and I received no response. So I switched up the question and ask how much longer is the wait and she answered \"about 5 minutes\". While waiting outside for about 15 minutes we wondered into Lucilles Bar-B-Q, which is literally about 10 steps away. We really weren't in the mood for barbecue plus the menu was a little more pricier than YardHouse, but the staff was so friendly and welcoming we considered it. We went back outside to wait but after about 25 minutes we returned the pager and told the \"the boss\" aka Allessa that we were leaving. What's even worse is that her attitude basically said good ridden. Something like that could definitely ruin your night especially when you have high hopes of a great experience. My lady and I ended up waiting an hour to be seated at Lucille's barbecue but the wait was well worth it! In my line of work I have to give not just excellent but perfect customer service, otherwise I don't generate income. It's highly unfortunate that a reputable establishment such as Yard House would have employees representing the business in that manner. This place definitely doesn't live up to the excellent customer service experience associated with Station Casinos.",

Fish and chips pretty much Mortons-like.  The fries had potential if they had been hotter. (Thin but not quite match stick.)  My dining partner had dipped beef sandwich.  His comment was pretty much \"Meh, I've had better.\"  I would definitely go back for the beer, service and atmosphere but eat elsewhere.  I don't know about others, but I like salty little things to eat when drinking beer.  I would have killed for a can of pringles or something to nosh on.

And our server was friendly, and rendered excellent service.  Deviled Eggs topped by bits of bacon were creamy, and Chicken Lettuce Wraps contained moist chicken, except I would have preferred that the meat not be formed in cubes.  On the other hand, a Roasted Turkey Club, accompanied by serviceable French Fries, was a solid choice for comfort food.  No pressed turkey meat here!  The only negatives encountered on this night were a really loud noise level inside the dining room, and successive waves of circulating cool air that caused hot food to lose its heat rather rapidly.   3-1/2 stars overall!",

The service was painfully slow! It was a 3 hour experience. Our grandson's order was wrong! He was given chicken instead of the steak he ordered. He had to wait 20 minutes for it to be replaced - which is not easy for an 8 year old! Another member of our party was given burnt fish and chips which she wasn't able to eat. My steak sandwich was pretty darn good though! The manager came over to apologize and offered free desert for our trouble. Little did we realize we would have to wait 24 more minutes for the 2 small deserts she brought for our table of 5! She should have comped our whole meal! When a restaurant ruins a special occasion they should work hard to make it better - not make it worse. Very disappointed!",

The food was always pretty good, and lets be honest, the beer and dining menu is so extensive, there's honestly a little something for everyone.  Last night I went to dinner here with my fiance and his family, since his aunt was leaving Vegas for a while to stay with her daughter on the East Coast. Since we had a bigger party, I understand that things happen and sometimes there's an issue or two with someone's food, but not to the extent that we experienced. It truly was a series of unfortunate food events. Yikes.   Here's the combined list of what happened:  - My fiance had ordered a roast beef dip sandwich, which looked delicious at first, but when he went to pick it up, there was hardly any bread on the bottom and it was soaked in Au Jus. Would you want to eat a soggy sandwich?   -My fiance's mom had ordered a shrimp appetizer, which ended up being undercooked.   -My fiance's brother had ordered a beer, which never arrived.  Now, despite all the issues the customer service was extremely attentive. They made up for each of the mistakes, but they just kept on happening which ended up making the experience less enjoyable. While we did appreciate the great service from the manager, I'm not sure that we will be making a trip back there any time soon.",

Their peachy belgian beer cocktail is heavenly in the hot Vegas weather.  The restaurant is always a bit loud, but thats what you get with a bar in the center of the room I guess. Still a cool place to grab a great meal.",

All I can say is Wendy is amazing and if you have the opportunity to request a server, request her! She is super helpful, a firecracker, and she knows her food!  We really just asked Wendy for recommendations and ordered everything she said and we were not disappointed at all! We got the mac and cheese...yum! And the egg rolls...and they were all yummy!!  If you are looking for a fun drink, they did make a good Bloody Mary which helped me out tremendously that day!!!",

    "text": "I have been here twice with a friend.  Ordered appetizers the first time, and the food was great.  However, the service was not only glacially slow, but our waiter (and all the others) were next to impossible to flag down for more water, a second drink, missing utensils.  Tried to flag people down only to be ignored - the only way we got what we needed was to physically walk around and chase someone down. The second time was the LAST time for this place - was seated by the host and literally waited 12 minutes, still no one had come by to say \"hello\" let alone take our drink orders or bring water.  I went up to the host, whose station was RIGHT NEXT to our table and asked where our server was, that we hadn't even gotten water.  The host used his radio and then he too physically seemed to have to chase after our waiter in the kitchen. When the host returned, he said our waiter would be right here.  Well.....13 minutes later he did show up, but at our neighboring table who had been seated AFTER us!!  My friend and I looked up at the host, who just shrugged and smiled at us.  As anyone can appreciate, that was it - my friend had been keeping track of time, and we left after waiting there 29 minutes!!!! We are locals and frequent Red Rock often.  However, the Yard House has lost us as customers.  The only reason they get one star is because the food is good.  Our treatment, or lack therefore by being ignored as customers is inexcusable.   The management may contact me if they like, as I'm sure no manager of quality would accept this treatment of patrons by their staff.",

The staff is always so friendly and kind. They always help to make your experience the best. No matter if we sit at the bar or dine in, every server and hostess has been great. Not only is the staff amazing, but so is the menu. They have such a great selection. I never can decide because everything is so delicious! I normally go for the Coconut Shrimp or the Orange Chicken, but everything I have ordered in the past is all delicious. They also have an amazing selection of beer, wine and cocktails. And can't forget dessert! So good. Their prices are very reasonable for how amazing they are. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone!",

What were we thinking IT'S PACKED! We waited 10-15 minutes to be seated. Our drink order was taken right away and were provided with current beer specials which my husband loved. We ordered an appetizer, my son's kids meal and our entrees within 10 minutes of sitting. I love the Chicken Bowl! I'm sad that it's off the menu! So I asked our AWESOME server Densie if it was possible to order the Chicken Bowl. She replied, \"For you, of course!\" That made my whole day! Appetizer and my son's food came out first (thank God because I thought he was going to eat the table). And my chicken bowl came out in a matter of minutes. Then she came out with my son's ice cream. He was the happiest kid.   Just the best service and freshness I could ask for and one a especially a busy night. Please Denise employee of the year! She has our vote!",

My friend and I met up for dinner, we had a few glasses of wine and appetizers. Our servers name was Tina. She didn't introduce herself as our server. She came to our table and said \"you guys ready to order?\" I guess we were talking for a bit because we haven't seen each other in awhile and didn't spend much time to look at the menu when we sat down.  During our dinner, my friend has noticed a bug was in her wine glass. We couldn't find our server Tina so we asked the first food runner we saw. We explained the situation to him and he was very helpful and brought us a new glass of wine. Our server didn't ask what happened and didn't seem concerned about the wine situation.   How do you not check on your table after they send an item back?! (especially when with both spent $52 on our glasses of wine)  Our server was very outgoing and laughing with her other tables around us but was short with us.   I am a server and my friend I was with is a bartender. We are both in the service industry and we both left feeling like the service/experience wasn't there.   Towards the end of the meal, Tina introduced us to our new server because she was leaving for the night.   Overall, not a great experience and probably will not come back to yard house anytime soon.   Pros: all the beers on tap, the gardein items and vegan menu, happy hour from 3pm-6pm specials, opened late   Cons: Service",

Even though they ate busy, they are always efficient at getting you drinks, getting your order, and getting your food out to you in a timely manner. As soon as we walked in with a party of 5, we were seated. The waitress was great and had our drinks out to us in no time at all. Not once did my drink go empty without another full one sitting right next to it. I am a firm believer in the notion that if you keep my drink full, you will get a good tip. The food was delicious. I ordered the turkey club sandwich and it did not let me down. The sourdough bread was toasted to perfection and was not so hard that it cut up my mouth. The fries were seasoned in just the right amount. Everyone at my table enjoyed both the food and the atmosphere. The restaurant can get loud at times, but this should be expected from a sports bar/grill type establishment. We will certainly be back again.",

Also ordered 2 Caesar salads and 2 small pizzas ( BBQ chicken and Thai chicken.) the salads were great. Dressing was light yet tangy and they had baked cheese crisps in it. Oh those were yummy!! The pizzas were good but the bottom of both pizzas had way to much flour on the bottom. Made my mouth dry,But we had plenty of beer to choose from! 110 beer choices to be exact. Over all food was pretty good and service was awesome. Oh and I recommend going during happy hour. Lots to choose from at a great price :-)",

    "text": "This is a review of their lunch/afternoon menu.  The Skinny: so-so sandwich, okay pizza (2), space cadet waiter with a lengthy wait (1), pretty good lunch special pricing (3).  My hubby and I came here at 2 pm to grab a late lunch.  This place had a nicer vibe at lunch than during their evening hours - less loud, less pretentious, less obnoxious.  We were surprised how bad the service was given that the day before we'd had an excellent waiter. Our waiter gave us our menu and then went MIA most of the time. It took longer than 10 minutes to put down our order. It took over 30 minutes for our food (a crab-cake sandwich special and a bbq chicken pizza) to arrive which is bad considering that 1) the restaurant was lacking patrons during this time and 2) they are trying to cater to the speedy lunch crowd.  The crab cake sandwich ought to be bread with a small side of crab-cake. There were large slices of bread to the point where you can barely see the crab cake. My husband did not finish the bread and actually opened up his sandwich and just ate the crabcake. The french onion soup it came with was okay - not cheesy enough but okay.  The bbq chicken pizza was okay - not great. The crust was not crisp enough. Too little toppings with too much sauce made this pizza feel pretty unbalanced. The accompanying field green salad was fine except for the raw leeks that were in there. (Leeks are really not meant to be raw, dudes!).  Overall, this lunch service needs to be improved to match what happens here in the evening.",

If it's overwhelming to you, ask the bartender and they'll always suggest something to try.  Food is tasty and presented nicely. I typically get a sandwich. I'm a sandwich connoisseur, and they make a mean roast beef on garlic toast that is always tasty.   My girlfriend says the grilled cheese is the best ever. Not the kid style, American cheese between two pieces of Wonder bread, but 3 kinds of cheese melted between artisan bread served with a tomato bisque that is quite tasty too. A classic combo.",

I had been here twice before and enjoyed it so no surprise is again proved to be a solid choice. I arrived a bit early but didn't feel like sitting at the bar so I just loitered around the empty waiting area which may have been a slight annoyance to the hostess girls, perhaps interrupting a run down of Saturday night's activities? They were nice though and tried to act unaffected.  When my friend arrived were were seated promptly in a booth, which I requested(no prob)    Immediate service netted us an ice cold Stone IPA(me) and some tasty cider-ish thing(her)...yum. I ordered a Pastrami sandwich and salad from their build it yourself combo lunch special.($10) and it was quite good. Tasty, juicy pastrami on a half sized fresh deli roll with mustard and pickles and a nice garden salad pre-dressed nicely, not too dry, not too wet. My friend's salad looked good and we were both pleased headed out for some mindless entertainment. Always solid, this is a consistent, convenient  and comfortable spot with a fantastic selection of beer and solid food to boot.",

Not since I lived in Strasbourg, France, and frequented The Irish Times bar, where I would often drink this tasty brew, have I seen Kilkenny anywhere. I've been searching for it on US soil for years, and have come up empty handed. Not for lack of trying, mind you. Distributors just don't sell it here. But the Yard House on Charleston, at the Red Rock Casino has it! It's a miracle. I've been to other Yard Houses, with no luck. This is the only one. So if you've been searching for this beer, like me, this is the place for you to go. Plus the food is pretty good, and the Red Rock Casino is one of my favorites in the valley. Go play a game of Bingo. It's one of the best deals around!",

Even though this Yard House is located inside Red Rock Casino it is not owned by them so they don't accept any of the mailer coupons from the hotel~   HOT TIP: Happy Hour:  Monday - Friday 3pm - 6pm                                        Sunday - Wednesday 10pm - Close                                       Last Seating: 30 minutes prior to close",

I don't usually like going to restaurants where I know there will be a 30+ minute wait to eat during peak hours/days (Friday night dinner, or so..). But I would definitely never say no to some Yardhouse.  The price is right for the food you receive. The atmosphere is calm and not over the top, and modern. Comfortable. The service is well trained, and inviting across the board.  You can't really go wrong here because of the great selection and convenient location (at least for me)!",

Our group came here after an Unofficial Yelp Event at Red Rock Canyon.  They set up for 10 because we weren't sure how many were coming.  We ended up with 8 so the set up was perfect.  Drink orders were taken quickly.  We must have looked like we could use rehydration after the 4.5 mile hike.  Refills were always quick to come.  My iced tea was refilled 3 times and our server brought two of us a glass with extra ice as our ice started melting.  For food, I ordered from their lunch pick two menu.  I got the turkey club with a bowl of clam chowder.  The club sandwich was good.  Each quarter had a piece of avocado which added to the flavor.  There were a lot of clams in the chowder.  It was enjoyable also.  The service.  Tina, our server, was simply top notch at what she does and that's the reason for the 4th star.  She was always around refilling drinks, checking on whether or not someone needed anything, and generally keeping the best care for us she could.  She also had an instinct of some kind such that she gave us individual checks without asking if it was one check or separate.  That's SERVICE!    I'll be back.  Even though I live about 1/2 mile away, this was the first time I'd been at this Yard House.  Tina and the food won me over!",

I also watched the bartender complain about putting a sugar on the rim of my drink, as they didn't have \"time\" for that! I hate giving negative feedback..... HOWEVER, this is called the service industry for a reason! Buck up and do your job, do it well or find another one.",

After getting tired of waiting at the casino bar for a drink, I decided to head over to the Yard House (which is located inside the casino) to grab a craft brew instead.   I have been to plenty of Yard House's during my existence, and this visit in Summerlin was great. I found a seat at the bar and was quickly offered menus from the busy bartenders. The beer selection was solid as always, and the food was consistent. I always get the wings and veggie buffalo bites, and both were delicious as always.   My favorite part of the night though was their entertainment for the night. They played random pop music videos all night. I LOVE music videos, and the fact that they were playing them in the bar caused me to stay longer and rack up a bigger bill than planned. Oh well, it was worth it.",

The restaurant is very dark inside but enough light to see where you are walking. The bar was clean and had a great selection of draft beers. The booth we sat in was clean and our waiter was punctual and attentive the entire meal. I order three appetizers which came out within 10 minutes of ordering. The buffalo wings were crispy and had plenty of sauce. I recommend the fried Mac and cheese. It's similar to what you find at Pluckers wing bar. And finally I order the garlic noodles which come with a light sauce that barely covers the boddles and mushrooms throughout. Over the food was good and still hot when it came out so I enjoy that they don't let it sit in the back too long. My meal was $35 before tip. Not too bad for the amount of food I received.",

We first came for lunch with about a dozen people and the service was great...we had food and beer coming at us from all angles.  I ordered the Grilled Korean BBQ Beef, which I was impressed to even see on the menu. I thought it was pretty tasty, although I have to admit that I had a more flavorful version elsewhere the following night. To drink I ordered the El Picante, which was absolutely perfect. The giant charred jalapeno on top imparted such a nice smokiness...best drink I've had so far in LV. I also inherited a friend's pineapple cider, which was very good.  Lunch was such a success that we came back for a quick dinner before leaving the hotel for the night. This time I ordered the Carnitas Taco, and it was flawless. The pork was juicy and flavorful, and the pineapple chunks provided some much-appreciated sweetness.   The only miss of the entire day was the creme brulee, which was topped with bananas, something I'd never seen. There were a couple of bruleed pieces of banana on the side, which I thought was interesting, but topping the ramekin with more thin banana slices left the custard underneath without its characteristic sugar crust. The custard was also rather bland.  I don't want to end on a bad note though, bc this place really does a lot of things well!",

He made it a point to make a personal experience while you were dining.  It was wonderful.    Our table shared some Queso with Chorizo to start.  It's served with tortilla chips as well as pita bread. Rich in flavor and great to share.  I would definitely add the chorizo every time. Our turkey sandwich was great.  The swiss & fontina cheese accompanied with the avocado and jalapeno spread made this sandwich so delightful!  A turkey sandwich with a little kick is always good!  The BBQ chicken pizza was good but nothing over the top. I would suggest ordering one of their other pizzas or menu items.  We enjoyed a great lunch with great service.  Thanks Yard House!",

    "text": "3.5 and surprisingly good for a chain. Went here for a family brunch yesterday. We were a party of 15 and we probably all came at various times but the seating area they gave us was a tad awkward, split across three tables. Me and the hubby arrived last and kinda squished in.   Hubby was in indecisive mode so I ordered two things thinking he could have some and then decide his own later. I got the Korean beef appetizer and the shiitake garlic noodles which were listed under snack. Sufficed to say both plates came out and we realized hubby def wouldn't need to order anything else! They def give you huuuge portions.  The beef was well seasoned although a tad chewy. It came on a bed of rice and had pickled carrots and diakon and sauteed greens. I was surprising more impressed with the noodles. Hubby don't care for them much but I thought these were delish! Almost buttery... garlicy and mushroomy goodness. A great meatless option if you need one.  Oh and we got some drinks; I got the refresher , and he got the el picante marg. Mine was as it's name would suggest very refreshing!! But hubby's was the star imo. It was peppery n spicy, salt rimmed and sugary in a perfect blend! I declare all margs I get now should come with a charred jalapenos!!  Oh at some point we also had some of a pineapple cider... it was verrry pineappley and the hubby loved it. Lastly we ended with what I would say was the weakest point, a creme brulee for dessert. I know right?! How could that be?? Well they put banana slices on top and brulee those. I like bananas don't get me wrong but I think the two side pieces would have been sufficient and it lacked the nice crust I wanted because the actual creme did not get torched at all.",

There are apparently multiple Yard House locations in Vegas-- we have been to this one at Red Rock and the one on the Strip at the Linq.  Big pro for the Yard House is the sheer selection of beers and ciders! I love the options and the different sizes you can order.  They also have a good happy hour from 3-6pm for beer and appetizers. We got there in time to take advantage of the cheaper beers and some appetizers before dinner.  Our server (I wish I remembered her name) was great and came around the perfect amount of times, making sure we were well taken care of. She was accommodating to splitting our check 5 ways.",

I Came with a friend that highly recommended the vegan burger here, so I had to try it. First of all,  let me just say, Kayla went above and beyond and even exceeded our expectations. We ordered drinks, my friend asked for something that wasn't normally offered and Kayla made it happen. It may not have been a big deal to her but the fact that she took a few extra moments of her time to do what she did, really spoke volumes to me and about her.  I used to be a server and this would totally have been something I would have done! She was so sweet and came back several times to make sure everything was okay. The Vegan burger was delicious!! It wasn't dry at all. There was a vegan cheese on it that tasted great as well, and the size did not dissapoint. We ate it with fries and they had great flavor that complimented the meal.  Yardhouse has always been a good choice for food or drinks. It had a been a while since I last ate here, but Kayla really shined yesterday and I thought I should take my own moment to make this review.  Thank you so much Kayla for being so awesome. You made a great night, even better, just by being you. You are a superstar!!",

The staff and servers were very professional and the food was top notch! A great place to eat if you're passing by of if you're staying in the Red Rock Casino & resort. Go there, now!!!!   Don't forget to go there for whatever game you intend to watch. The atmosphere is kinetic with excitement!!!! Also,  I am not a vegan or processed vegetarian, but I could order nothing but the gardein wings and be happy.",

This one is tucked away in Summerlin at Red Rock Hotel & Casino. Great ambiance and spacious atmosphere.   I've tried a variety of foods that were all great from here from chicken nachos, salads, turkey sandwich, calm chowder, bbq chicken pizza, poke nachos- new favorite, poke stack, spicy tuna, & my recent try of gardein fried chicken strips- which was my not so favorite, I liked the regular version better.   They have great choices for drinks and you can always ask for a sangria since they have enough wine variety to make it even though it's not on the menu.",

She told us about the \"Pick 4\" so I could try my own choices of drinks. It was awesome. She continued to keep a positive attitude all night long always making us smile or laugh when she stopped by the table. Our food was amazing.

He asked to make our food again; by this time it was over 30 minutes from when we ordered.  Can only imagine how long a second order would take.  He acted very surprised that we wanted to leave.  He asked if he could give us a gift card.  We were starving and wanted to go and get food, so we declined. Bummer cause we brought 2 people from out of town with us.  How embarrassing.

Over our dinner date was kinda ruined here and won't be back for a while",

My husband and I have recently started just sharing their chicken nachos and order a side of their queso with it. So, so delicious and filling. In the past I have ordered their Penne with Chicken, which was good. My husband tried their fish and chips, said it was OK, but kind of oily. They have vegan/vegetarian options which is good for when friends come to visit. They said what they ordered was delicious. Plenty of parking, friendly staff, haven't had any long wait times. Always enjoy our visits here.",

I also ordered lobster garlic noodles which was the SMALLEST serving I've ever seen with two tiny pieces of lobster, ZERO crab, and saturated with excess sauce. Jesus Christ. Way to skimp out on the lobster. And lastly, to finish off this absolute shit show, I ordered the mini trio sampler and they gave me MELTED, tiny scoops of ice cream. The service is also a joke.

Not to mention his food knowledge is perfection! My sister and I are both servers so we understand what it's like! As for the food the ahi Tina salad was perfect but the truffle bacon burger was not the greatest it lacked flavor. Mark you're awesome and if I ever go back to serving I hope I can be just as kind, patient, and knowledgeable as you are!",

For how expensive this place is my party of 10 expected so much more. 2 hours to order and get food? By the time the messed up entrees came, who wanted to wait for them to get it right? So disappointed on a random Thursday at 8pm. Won't be wasting my time nor money here. Others be prepared for a long drawn out meal...even when everyone in our party was immediately ready to order.",

    "text": "Had two meal at the Yard House.  This restaurant is connected to the Red Rock Hotel and Casino. We chose to eat there both times because they had TVs everywhere and the NFL playoffs were on.    For lunch I had the Ahi Tuna sandwhich.  Actually the Tuna was delicious.  It was sushi grade tuna, perfectly seared on the outside and raw on the inside.  The problem is this...If all of the slippery things, like tomatoes, caramelized onions and aioli sauce are all touching each other on the sandwich, its gonna slide and fall apart.  That's exactly what happens with this sandwich.  After the first bite, the whole thing just slides apart.  It was absolutely delicious, but you don't want it to look like it has been in your stomach before you eat it.  And it is really messy for lunch when you have to go back to work meetings.   Later on that night, I brought my wife back for dinner. We had to wait almost 45 minutes for a table.  It was REALLY busy...But we had a couple beers while we waited and watched football.    For dinner I had the Porcini crusted halibut, Parmesan mashed potatoes, porcini cream sauce, white truffle oil, asparagus and bok choy.  The fish was SO overcooked that it was stiff.  The rest of the plate was ok, I guess, but when the protein isn't cooked well, the rest of the meal is a let down.  I think it's because the place is so busy.  The food tastes like the cooks are overwhelmed and can't keep up. It's not clear if it was fresh or frozen because it was so overcooked.  It was also a very small portion of fish and a ton of potatoes.  This place has the potential to be really good, but they need to straighten out some things back in the kitchen...",

I visited Las Vegas this past weekend, and this location is just as awesome as I recall. Hands down, the best Yardhouse I've been to.  The food quality is consistent. There are plenty of vegetarian menu items prepared with Gardein's meat substitute. The Thai chicken salad is delicious, as is the chicken/mushroom macaroni and cheese, firecracker wings, and buffalo chicken pizza. They have wonderful French onion soup, and a ton of delicious appetizers. To name a few, I enjoy the grilled artichoke, spicy tuna roll, coconut shrimp, and moo shu egg rolls. The small plates are affordable sharing options; the flatbreads, deviled eggs, and ceviche are my choices. Obviously, I eat here a lot. AND THE BEER. PLENTY OF DELICIOUS BREWS ON TAP. Listen, there's really nowhere else in Vegas I'm going to find a decent selection of porters and stouts, so it's only natural I come here.   The service here has always been 5 stars, for the 5 and a half years I lived here and even during my last visit. The wait may look horrific, but I've never waited longer than 30 minutes on a Saturday night, and the staff is super friendly and very good at what they do. It may get noisy in here, but the ambiance is nice and the restaurant is clean. Huge bar, and outdoor dining is also an option.",

The times are shining now that I approach 40!  So many good times spent at Yard Houses celebrations of this achievement and that. Great rocking music, beer, inexpensive, and amazing food!   Today's visit was by chance looking for a bar to get a drink here at Red Rock; and felt comfortable coming here vs the many lounges that encompass the casino floor. It just feels more alive and raw in here.   I happened to make it for the happy hour menu too; which has not changed here at this restaurant in forever. One does not want to change something that is working. (Please don't!) Thankfully Yard House has not tried to fix something that does not need fixing. They have stayed True to a menu that I still remember enjoying ten years ago. Its absolutely priceless!  Knowing that I will not eat like this for awhile I decided to go with the cheese pizza which is rather large for only one. I have always wanted to try the onion rings tower and did that today!  The cheese pizza is usually on the appetizer menu and fed in the past at least three of us with lots of beer. The cheese pizza today takes me back and was just as good as I remembered it. The new tower of flowered onions dipped in grease is new and tasted so delicious.   The presentation of the tower of onion rings is so well done. This fantastic tower of rings is not dripping in as much grease, so you can hold the onion rings individually with out them slipping from your hand. It is awesome for sharing too. I think they should mix up the ring in the tower and serve it as an awkward tower of rings. But then it would loose its amazing appeal. So nixt that!  Rolling like the good old days went with Coors Light to wet and wash down my food. Beer goes well with grease and pizza so perfect pairing. I did enjoy that they served the Coors in a glass and not a bottle. It makes beer better to be served in glass. Cheers to company for keeping it classy.  The atmosphere and continued quality keeps people coming back again and again to Yard House to celebrate achievements and important feet's in their lives. The Yard House rewards its customers with continuous excellence and wonderful experiences ever single visit.",

Please, whatever you do, don't order the monstrosity on the menu known as Margherita Pizza. It's a liquid mess with huge chunks of garlic. The wings are not even good anymore.   They used to have beer runners that would bring your beer over in a timely fashion. Now your suds just sit on the bar and get warm before you can drink it. I waited almost 20 minutes for my beer order and it wasn't even crowded.  There are always fruit flies in the place. Now they are aggressive and will crawl all over your burgers and beer. I'm not prissy, but I don't want pissy fruit flies that just marinated in the bath rooms come crawling on my food.  And just when you don't think things can get worse, you get the bill rife with errors. I went during a promotion where burgers were half off and summer beer samplers were $5, yet the bill didn't reflect that. I would've ended up paying over $25 more if I hadn't caught their errors.  There are much better happy hour options in Vegas, I suggest you seek them out. A captain has to go down with a sinking ship, but not the customer. Sayanora Yard House, it was fun while it lasted.",

I get how you watch out for your business but who watches out for your customers?...when does someone  stand up for the customer... clearly you interchanged the word quality and substandard .... there's a big difference....",

The sweet potato fries were pleasantly warm and crispy, but also just didn't taste fresh. If you've ever made fries at home from scratch, you'd know.  The fried Mac n cheese and the Wisconsin cheese curds were definitely fun appetizers, but nothing that would knock your socks off. The sauces they came with were pretty meh.  The service was fine. The place was loud and filled with tourists when I was there.",

Our waiter Christian R went far and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our dinner. He was very knowledgeable about different beer and his recommendations were spot on.  I ordered frozen margarita and since my glass was short, Christian cut a plastic straw for me so I can enjoy my drink.

They were all outstanding, the eggs were a bit runny, but delicious.  I had the shrimp and calamari diablo, which was nice & spicy.  My son enjoyed his steak arrachera, and the other mains were also well prepared.  The reason for the low score this visit was the service.  I don't know if the waiter was new, or just over tasked, but he was sloooooww.  It took 20 mins to get a drink and the food took a while.  Other tables he was serving were also not happy, with one woman going to get a manager to complain.  Hopefully this is a glitch, as I really enjoy their food.",

Hubby ordered queso dip and fried Mac n cheese and I ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza.  Absolutely no complaints.  Service was fast and efficient and food was good.   The fried Mac n cheese I was like NO don't get because well how addicting are they. And it came out presented so cute and sure enough I'm like get an order to go (we didn't) but still - be careful with those things.

But take note that it's a hot dish because it's topped with jalapeno rings.  It comes with a very generous portion of fresh, seasoned poke, diced avocado chunks, and wonton nachos (so perfect)!  If you're a fan of Poke you'll know that when paired with avocado, it's very refreshing and light... but those wonton nachos do so well at complementing the dish.  I haven't been in the US for a while, so I just came here recently and noticed this gem on their happy hour menu.  Thanks, Yard House, for making your happy hour EVEN BETTER!  Yard House service and taste, at any location, is always on point, in my opinion.  Any meal time is great here, but if you can't already tell, the happy hour is one of my favorites- don't miss out!

This year will be 2 years since she has passed and I miss her every single day, but I was really struggling all day on January 3rd.  So I mentioned to Dallas who was our server for the evening, that it was my mother's birthday and since tequila was my mother's favorite spirit all four of us at the table were going to have a shot of tequila for Judy to celebrate her.  Dallas thought that was a great idea and then she headed off to the bar to get our drinks.  When she returned she not only had our 4 shots of tequila, but she brought out a birthday dish of cobbler/icecream and a candle with Happy Birthday written on the plate.  Dallas said \"this is for your mom....happy birthday Judy\".  Dallas was very busy that night and working her ass off, yet she found the time to do this small thing that in reality was the biggest gift to me in a long time.  She didn't have to do that, but that she took the time to do it, let alone even think about doing that is huge.  In that one small moment I learned everything I need to know about Dallas.  I really have to tell you that for all of the times my husband and I have meals there, to not have one bad experience is unreal.  Your managers Hope Pena & Allison Wnuck are so on the ball and always want to make sure that the customer is enjoying themselves.  Dallas, Krysta, Mark, Jared and all of your wait staff to numerous to mention are always on their game and truly work their behinds off.  I also love Antwone McDonnell at the other Yardhouse location in Townsquare.  Just excellent service and food at every single one I go to.  I would very much like for some sort of recognition for your staff.  I would also like this email to go to corporate and to the CEO of Yardhouse.  You need to be recognized.  If I can do anything else, please contact me.  Thank you so much! Cymbra",

    "text": "We had a great visit to the Yardhouse last week.  While getting in some much need space from the kids we decided to spend our date night at the Red Rock Casino.  We have been to other location's with mixed experiences in the past.  This night we decided to sit out side on the patio with the misters and it was just the right temp.    I selected the Jambalaya and she had the Gardein Chicken Sandwich.  Throughout the entire meal I was comparing the recipe to my mother's home made Jambalaya and at first I was a little disappointed.  Once the heat started kicking up and chunk's of the chicken and sausage and craw fish started blending in my mouth my thoughts changed.  This recipe was fairly respectable as far as Jambalaya's are concerned.  Nothing beats momma's home cooking but a very good dish that I would order again.    The Gardein (Faux) Chicken sandwich was pretty decent as well.  These Gardein products really try to mimic a meaty texture with vegan or veggie lover in mind.  I felt the texture was fairly chewy and was juicy like a real breast of chicken.  The Avocado on this sandwich was refreshing and made it perfect flavor combo on a hot summer night.   The YardHouse is a great place to try if you have a veggie lover in your group because they have something for everyone and an excellent beer selection as well.",

The service was exceptionally good, I wish I could remember his name but I can't seem to find our receipt at the moment.   We ordered a couple of drinks and the Poke Nachos and California Roll.   The Poke Nachos were delish but the California roll was a bit odd. It was more like a stack (rolls are rolled so a little surprising) but the flavors didn't quite go together nor did they reflect what you expect from a \"California Roll\".",

Had crab cakes that seemed hurried, but well executed. No big chunks of crab, but dressed up with a dressing that was too sweet. Crab cakes without chunks ranks just above the fast-food scale for me, and these were a gray conglomerate inside.",

Cold fries and it seemed like they gave me one bacon and it was cut in half. I was still hungry after I finished my plate. Service was great and when I explained how sorry this burger was to my waitress she did comp a dessert. Don't get the burgers if your hungry. Could have went to in n out and got a cheaper meal and been more satisfied then yard house. Don't know when I will be back if I do it will probably be for the beer on tap",

When they brought my bf his beer they gave him a dirty glass with literal dirt rings around the bottom of it and it wasn't chilled at all.

Which I found off considering the amount of TV's. I did like the fact there was no-smoking like PKWY Tavern. We sat at the bar and the staff was GREAT! Large beer selection and full bar. The food was good. Better than any other location to watch sports. We ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps. We didn't realize it had Tofu in them also. The menu mentions Tofu but then has a selection of meet. We thought when choosing chicken we would not be choosing Tofu. Turns out you get chicken with the Tofu. We couldn't figure out why the Chicken was \"spongy\". We didn't care for it;stopped eating it and they immediately removed them from the tab. The Wisconsin Cheese Curds are wonderful. Not a fan of the sweet dipping sauce. They have their own Buffalo wing sauce. It is good but has a TON of black pepper in it. I like black pepper so it was OK. But if you are not I wouldn't order. They changed their fries to the standard Fast Food CHEAP Fries. I would not order them even the Truffle fries.  Overall I would come back to watch sports and have some snacks. Just wish they had HH or game day prices.",

They have a lot of beers to choose from also though I'm not impressed with their wine selection.    They have a separate gluten free menu so be sure to ask for it if you're on a gluten free diet.    Just be weary if you're here for happy hour, sometimes they jack the price up or input it in \"error\" and charge you full price.  sneaky sneaky",

If you can't find something you like then you don't like beer.  In addition to a selection of seasonal brews, Yard House offers rotating beers on their Chalkboard List.  These limited run beers are available until the keg is kicked.  Then they are replaced the following Tuesday with a new label.  Be sure to ask a bartender for the current list.  Speaking of bartenders, the bar is where to go if you want quick and attentive service.  The floor servers do their best, but they handle several tables, run drinks, pile up at the service bar, etc.  Cut the line, order directly from a bartender. You'll save time and get better service. Not to mention you get a great view of the TVs . . .  If food is on your agenda, check out the street tacos (pork belly, carne asada and swordfish are top picks; white fish tacos if you're calorie conscious).  On game days, the traditional or boneless buffalo wings are a must.  Go for the chicken nachos if you're feeling indulgent (bring a friend; the dish is big enough to share).  The burgers, sandwiches, and pizzas are what I classify \"upscale bar food\".  The dishes fill you up and satisfy, but they won't win any awards.",

With an open parking lot, you're only a few steps away from their outdoor patio or main entrance where smiling faces will quickly greet you.  BUT, dinner time can be a small wait.  Yes, it is a popular place and many others know it, so be prepared to grab a drink or two at the bar (if there is space) before your table is ready.  Where to start once you are seated?  A drink, for sure...and they are known for their many choices of beers. Ask your server for the most popular. Wine and cocktails are great too.  For an appetizer, try their Hawaiian poke stack, grilled jerk wings, Buffalo wings, pastrami sliders, Ahi sliders...  Your main meal, you have to try (and share) their Mac + cheese which has a chicken breast, apple wood smoked bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and Parmesan cheeses with pasta and white truffle oil. Their Southern fried chicken is also great along with my favorite (and very filling) New York steak salad.  This bad boy has field greens, roasted peppers, avocado, green beans, crispy potatoes and red onion tossed in Gorgonzola vinaigrette with beefsteak tomatoes and fried pickled egg.  Mmm Mmmm...  If you have enough room and you're not afraid to loosen that belt a notch or two, check out their desserts, I enjoyed their macadamia nut cheesecake. A friend had a Kona coffee ice cream sundae and another went \"lite bite\" and ordered their Mini lemon souffle with fresh raspberries and house made whipped cream.  Bottom line, come hungry with many friends to enjoy the evening.",

I highly recommend the southern punch for you alcoholic drinker types, good stuff. The beers are always good. It never seems to fail we come here when it's slow or we come when it's packed but we always get servers that we have to track down for refills or request.    Servers need to be more vigilant checking on their customers needs. Our waiter was on us to order, checking every minute to see if we were ready, poof then he disappeared. We had to hail down waiters for refills not great for customer service so shame on you yard house for that.. Good job cooks!!",

It's a great space...roomy...great for a happy hour with friends...and fantastic for a late dinner (the kitchen is open until 1am on Friday & Saturday nights).  I started off with the Lobster, crab and artichoke dip...hot, cheesy...great with the accompaning chips for slices of pita bread.  I drank my dessert...that is, I had a half and half...Youngberry Chocolate!  Half raspberry beer...half chocolate stout...it was a fantastic melding of flavors in my mouth!  The beer list is extensive, so I definitely have this on my list for my next trip to Vegas!  For dinner, I had the grilled cheese (three cheeses on sourdough bread) and organic tomato and basil bisque.  WOW!  That was a fantastic combination of cheeses and soup...the fried basil leaf on top was the perfect accent.  Along my main course, I ordered a side of truffle fries...these were divine!  If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll know that I LOVE anything with truffles...this definitely didn't disappoint!  Perfectly fried shoe string fries...sprinked with fresh herbs, salt, black pepper, parmesan cheese and truffle oil. YUM!!  This meal definitely didn't disappoint...my only regret is that I don't live closer!",

Me and my girlfriend visit this location at least once a week and the quality is almost identical every time. My favorite beverage is their GREATNESS, Its a combination of Guinness and Lost Coast Great White, Light with a bit a kick YUM :)... The only thing thats a bit on the negative side is the wait time. Weekends it can take up to an hour if not more for them to seat you but at the end the experience is well worth it every time. Thanx Yard House :)",

First I tried the House Tripel which was good, if not a tad malty for my taste. Then I had the North Coast Pranqster, one of my absolute favorite beers - golden and fruity. It was a decent price ($4) for a pint since it was HH. Drinks and food arrived fast. I went with the Baja Fish Street Tacos and they were incredible! Not very big portions, but combined with the beer enough to fill me up. I will definitely be back for more. Can't wait to try this again with friends. Highly recommended.",

When going out to eat in Vegas with there being so many options it's rare that I go to the same place more than once, especially being new and wanting to explore. But I crave this place so I keep going back (to the one in Red Rock or the 2nd location in the Quad) It has a cool bar vibe with tons of beer options, which is where I was introduced to my new favorite, Leinikugal (however you spell it) Sunset Wheat - it tastes like Fruit Loops! The wait staff has consistently been friendly and the menu is as big as a book...and that's my only complaint, narrowing it down to what I want to order feels like trying to make a life altering decision. Ok it's not that dramatic, but I do have to keep going back to try all the different things on the menu that made me salivate just reading. The food tastes like fine dining quality, without the stuffy restaurant ambiance. I can't sing this place's praises enough and hope I get a coupon or something for this heart felt review, cause I still have about 20 menu items I need to try  :)",

Inside was freezing so we asked to be seated outside bc it was warmer. My friends wives were still cold so my buddy asked if they could turn on the heaters above our table. The manager came out and Said that the heaters were all connected so he wouldn't turn them on bc they might heat up the neighboring 3 tables. Makes sense, no big deal. When my buddy asked him if he could Ask the other tables if they minded the heaters bc his wife was extremely cold, the manger Rudely said \"I'm not going to ask people that.\" Very weird for a manager to speak that way, but maybe he is having a bad day. I have an oil allergy. I told our waiter I have the allergy and asked for my asparagus to be steamed. I also ordered a med Rare steak. Food comes out , my asparagus is drenched in oil my steak is well done. They  also totally forgot my buddies steak all together. Very bad customer experience",

    "text": "I like beer. I like light beers, dark beers, imports, domestics, blondes... I don't discriminate. So this place, naturally, is high on my list of places to visit when I feel like a cold one.   Except only kinda.   My problem is that despite the enormous collection of beers they have, which is an awesome sight, I invariably end up with the same two or three beers. So, what good is 100+ options on tap when I just need three of those? Also, this place being not near my house, how many beers can I really sample when I have to drive back in the hood?   Still, this place is kinda cool. I'm always impressed by the amount of beer these guys must to serve on a nightly basis, and I'm impressed by what some of the bartenders seem to know about beers. On more than one occasion I've walked in and said \"Surprise me\" and gotten a delicious beer. (I've also gotten gross ones, where I drink it because I'm too cheap to waste it).   In terms of the food, it was good. It wasn't amazing, nor was it the kind of food you get at your local dive. I had a burger, which was pretty good. My date had a salad, which didn't seem too good from where I was sitting. I wouldn't come here for the food selection, which seems fair given that this place is known for beer over food.   All in all, I will return. I will not really go out of my way for this place, but I'll come back when I'm on this side of town.",

    "text": "I don't think I would have ever tried this place if someone hadn't given us a gift card, but I am so glad I did!    Looking in from the outside, it's not my kind of place.  I don't drink, so a big, noisy and crowded bar and a restaurant known for their beer selection didn't really appeal to me. But like I said.... we had gift card, so hubby and I gave it a shot.  We've been TWICE now, and I have been extremely impressed both times.    The first time we sat on the patio, which was really nice and comfortable.  It was a little chilly that day, so I was worried it would be too cold, but the hostess was really nice and let us go out and see how it felt before committing to an outside seat.  It turned out to be just fine because they have little space heaters out there which worked perfectly.  On a Yelp recommendation, we ordered the truffle fries as an appetizer (or a \"snack,\" I think they called it).  They were delicious, but we found out later that if your entree comes with fries, you can upgrade them to truffle fries (as well as garlic fries, sweet potato fries or onion rings) for just a dollar more, and you get a TON of fries -- way more than you get for the $4 \"snack\" portion -- so if you're interested in trying them, I would go that route instead.  Anyway, the hubs went for his favorite thing on earth - Mac n Cheese - and he was not disappointed.  I tried a bite of it and I had to agree it was pretty darned tasty.  I went for the grilled cheese with tomato basil soup and I have to say... that was the most delicious grilled cheese I have ever had in my life.  That's some big words, cuz I've had some pretty good grilled cheeses in my time!    About halfway into it, though, I started to feel my arteries clogging and as I looked at the small puddle of oil collecting on my plate, I was feeling really guilty about how much i was enjoying it.  I think they must have slathered each slice of bread with a full stick of butter and then used about 2 pounds of thick-cut, full-fat cheese.  No WONDER it tasted so good! I was pretty happy that their dessert menu is crappy because I wasn't even the least bit tempted to order some more fattening food.  On our visit #2, we took an inside seat, which was still nice, but very loud.  If you're on a date, I would suggest taking the patio seating, which seemed a bit more quiet.  But be warned... even THAT is loud.  This isn't a quiet restaurant by any means.  This time we started out with the lobster/crab/artichoke dip.  Another good choice.  The husband got some kind of monster-sized burger with garlic fries (here's where we found out about the \"upgrade\") and I got the crab cake sandwich with onion rings.  Nothing bad to say about any of that!!  I feel like the price is good for the quality of food and the level of service you receive here.  We ordered an appetizer and two entrees on each visit, and both times the bill came out to about $40-$45 with tip.  Well worth it for our fabulous meals and some leftovers to eat the next day.  We'll definitely be back.",

We came on a week night, so it wasn't too crowded.  There didn't seem to be too many tourists, which was nice.   This time around, I tried the Tangerine Wheat, which was really fruity, and refreshing, but I expected it to be a little more tart, and a bit less hoppy.   My second choice was the House Honey Blonde, and I loved it!  It was very light, smooth, and had a lovely honey aftertaste. My boyfriend told me that I would probably like Boddington's, so I tried that as well.  It was very unique, and super tasty.  It's kind of like Guinness, but it's light.  It has a creamy feel to it, very enjoyable. The bartenders were very friendly, attentive, and experts at pouring pints. Overall, I think if the price of the Yard House experience isn't a deterrent, then you should definitely stop by.  If it is, stop by during happy hour.  There are drink specials, and the appetizers are half off.  The chicken nachos are a personal favorite.",

I was staying Red Rock, didn't want to leave the cool atmosphere and met some friends who were locals. The Yard House didn't disappoint. I started salivating at the hundred plus kegs at the entrance. I knew right then and there, I was home.   Dig on the sizes of the beers. You can get an eight ounce sampler, a regular pint. or this massive glass. I stuck with the eight ounce and pints and traveled around the world with beer. Japan. Belgium. Australia. The US. Come on, I had to have me some PBR. I'm a Midwestern boy.   Service was top notch. Scott was our waiter's name. You know how to tell a good server? They don't talk down to kids. They treat them like customers. And that's what he did. Our kids (who behave in restaurants, yeah, I'm a proud Dad, I gotta give 'em some props) were treated well by Scott.   The winner at the table was Jambalaya Pasta. I had entree envy over it. It was perfect. My salad was fresh (I had to offset the beer calories somehow!) and while small, it was good. Tzvi got fish and chips. He always does. He digs it. And he said this was one of the best he's had.   This place is perfect if you're at Red Rock, wiped out from swimming, don't want to leave the resort, have kids and want a nice, cold beer.   And it was like, 112 degrees that day. Perfect beer drinking weather!   Next time I'm in LV, I'll probably be back.",

We were informed that they could not do so as it was \"First come, first served\" service. Fair enough. As we could not find 2 seats by the bar, we were looking for someone leaving soon. After 10 minutes we finally spotted a couple getting ready to leave, we immediately jumped there. Once we sat down, another bartender came to us and told us those seats were reserved for another couple that was waiting. Hmmm didn't another waiter has just told the opposite??? We were quite upset and were not going to leave since there were no reservations taken for a bar and we were the first to spot those vacating seats. The bartender called a supervisor who yet told us the same thing that a couple was waiting before us and those seats were reserved. She was quite rude about that too.   We were sooo angry, we called up a regional manager who took 20-30 minutes to arrive; he did, however, straighten the situation but we were way too pissed to enjoy a meal and drinks. We left shortly after. The experience was qite bad, I will not be visiting Yardhouse at Red Rock again.",

At this particular YardHouse, they will not bring you a beer until the one you have is less than a quarter done.  So now you must wait another 20-30min until the server comes around to check to even make an order. They let us slide a little because they thought we were a good crowd....ridiculous",

Asked to sit on the patio and expected to be seated at one of the empty two-tops with somewhat of a view albeit the parking lot.  Hostess took me somewhere else and I asked if I could sit at one of the empty two tops.  She had to make me stand there while she went back to the desk to see if it was okay.  When she came back she basically told me no, because there was no server assigned to that area....but there were people seated within 6 feet on each side of where I wanted to sit! So, I asked why one of the servers handling those people couldn't handle one lone diner sitting within 6 feet!?! The moment she started to argue with me, I walked out.  Stupid and never should have happened.  Poor customer service and a lack of hospitality training. Will spend my money elsewhere today.",

On several occasions, it is the service that will dictate your dining experience. Here , the staff is well educated in their menu, beverages and protocols.

And the wait always seems to be longer too. When our server asked if we wanted separate checks, and we said yes, a 20 minute debacle ensued as she had no clue who had ordered what. Not enjoyable. The ambiance here is the same as any other Yard House. The food and beer is the same too. (Duh, it's a chain.) I like that the beers rotate enough to keep things interesting. And while the beer list isn't crazy beer snob-ish, there's enough to tantalize most beer palates. And while the food isn't gourmet or necessarily crave-worthy, it's good enough to satisfy most foodies.  My particular favorites are the queso (it's actually a bit unique) and the mac 'n' cheese (it's chock full with multiple cheeses, bacon, and chicken). The bernaise sliders are also a fav. But they've stopped putting the bernaise sauce on the burgers and just serve it on the side. (Hint: The bernaise sauce makes for a nice fry dipping sauce.) Everything else I've had here has been just fine. There's been nothing I wouldn't eat. But it's also not a place I come to unless someone else suggests it. All in all, it's an a-ok spot.",

We just ate it anyway since we waited for them long. Everyone else was done with our food by the time they ate! I can't believe they didn't even offer anything for the inconvenience. Table presence is key to good service and it was not here. I didn't really want to come back to this place because of service. I hate being profiled. I gave it a chance since they have great beer selection.  Which, by the way, we did not get in a timely manner. I pretty much hate this place now!!!!!!! Our server was lucky that we still tipped 15%!

    "text": "This place is disgusting. I have gotten food poisoning here so if you must go to this money trap serving FROZEN food, make sure you don't get any fish at all. The last time I was here, I dealt with extremely incompetent and sloppy managers. My food came out totally wrong and when a manager came to the table she was rude and uncaring. She also had a strange odor... A general manager was sent to the table who seemed to have the social skills of a pebble... he was very strange and I just wanted him away from my table and my kids...he gave us a strange vibe. Although he was apologetic, the next time my food was brought (this time a Smores brownie and some ice cream,) I found plastic in the dessert ! A few little pieces of hard plastic!!. Darden has really gone downhill. From the food they serve to especially the managers they hire. Since we were near a computer, I overheard a few servers talking about how miserable they are working here. Something about how managers purposely don't listen to employees availability, how servers get written up for the smallest things. I used to be a food server so when I go to restaurants I am always aware of how busy my server is, what they are dealing with etc. I've never had a problem with service here it seems like morale, management, food and overall quality is just down. It's a hard enough job for these servers why make it harder on them? Especially when you can't even do your own job. The cherry on the sundae was when an older manager came to the table as we were getting ready to leave. She looked stressed out all wide eyed and stated \" your burger will be right out I am so sorry.\" Uh... we hadn't even ordered a burger I told her. Damn, these managers better get it together, wouldn't you know your own tables at a restaurant you're managing ? If you're into happy hour checks that go above 50$ for you and one person, then this over priced chain dump is for you. Make sure you don't go in the summer, you'll be visited by some cockroaches for sure. Yummy !",

Now that they've opened up in Red Rock Casino, its even better! The restaurant has much more space than town square with higher ceilings and bigger outdoor patio seating. Not to mention flat screen TVs around to watch them sports.   The food here is great. These are my top picks on the Appetizer menu: Fried Calamari** (I'm a typical Filipina so you cannot NOT try calamari). Hawaiian Poke Stack** (De-lish! It's fresh ahi with crispy wontons, carrots, bean sprouts, avocado, and wasabi soy sauce). Spicy Tuna Roll ** (This is not a cut roll. This is like one round giant roll. But yummy. Has seared rare ahi, avocado, edamame, cucumber, and the wasabi soy sauce).   My favorite Entree salad is the Ahi Crunchy. It has seared rare ahi, Asian slaw, field greens, crispy wontons mixed in soy vinaigrette. I feel like I could go on forever on all the yummy entrees they have. They have everything from burgers to steaks, to pastas and seafood dishes. Which is a plus for me because I need OPTIONS, so having selections to choose from, I can pick depending on my mood of the day.  I am so glad that Yard House is much more closer to me, even for locals in the Summerlin area. I don't have to drive to Town Square and worry about the annoying one lane conversion once you exit Las Vegas Blvd off the 215. GIVE ME A SNAKE BITE PLEASE!!!",

Our server Natasha was extremely slow and had very little personality. I ordered the Cobb salad and crab cakes and my friend ordered a couple other items. It had been a few months since I had been there so I was unaware of menu changes, even though those changes were not listed on the menu nor were they verbalized to me by my server. So when I received my salad I was surprised because it was a completely different setup. When I asked what it was she said, \"it's your salad, like I was stupid\". I told her that's not how it usually comes and said that they had changed the menu a few months ago. She didn't offer to make it a different way or the old way and after her rude and off putting attitude I just told her I didn't want it. She then runs off with it and doesn't ask if I want something else until I had to ask her. A manager never came by the table to check on us. Our beers sat at the well forever and were warm by the time we got them. Yard House has gone down hill service wise. The food we had was decent, nothing really good. Won't be back here.",

We went last Sunday, my sandwich could've been more golden brown, but the bacon was super crispy and the cheese very gooey so that made up for it.  The clam chowder was very hot and generous with the clams.

    "text": "The only saving grace to this review is the fact that I've dined at this location without AS MANY issues as we had last night.    When I first moved here to Vegas, this was the first Yard House that I had ever been to and now I've been to many in a few different cities. I usually really enjoy Yard House because the food is good, there are so many different foods to choose from on the menu and they have my favorite 'Gin & Ginger' drink (that I modify to be completely different using Fireball..check out my 'Tips' for more on that).  Last night, however, was one huge disappointment after another in what I thought was an otherwise pretty consistently good corporate restaurant.  My friend decided to have his going away dinner here for all of the above reasons that I just mentioned but also because this boy LOVES beer.  I don't drink beer (gluten intolerance) and hence brings forth my first issue of the night.  I ordered a tequila and soda in a tall glass, with a splash of OJ and a lime, please.  My drink came in a short glass, with an orange slice and I'm not sure what the deal was but it tasted funk-ay. And this is my go-to drink, so I knew what to expect - and that wasn't it.   It started out that there was only 5 of us and we were sitting in the first-come-first-serve bar area.  My friend made sure to call almost a week in advance and spoke personally to the manager.  He made a reservation for 25 people for 7PM.  When I got there at 7, there was no table for us - hence the bar seating.  The numbers continued to grow with most people being forced to stand behind other people who were seated and crowd around our table like it was a bar in itself.  Not ideal for us as guests and I KNOW not ideal for the servers who were working.    The manager came over at one point to apologize, saying there was a 'mix up with the reservations' to which we assured him that we weren't high maintenance and totally willing to cooperate.  THEN he goes into 'actually, your party is really difficult for my servers because people are moving around so we're just going to have to group people together on checks and you guys can figure it out'. My friend, rightfully surprised, reassured the manager that we were easy going and he would cover anything left over at the end if checks got mixed up.  This was again,, where I started to get more irritated.  If everyone in the party had a SEAT, they wouldn't be moving around. Not to mention, most people didn't even have drinks because it was about a 20-30 minute wait between ordering something with a server and it actually showing up.  Trust me, this isn't an exaggeration. That one drink was my only drink of the night for this very reason.   When it came time to order food, I had actually taken the time to research the gluten-free options online beforehand so I would know what to order.  As I'm ordering the 'Chopped Salad', I recite from the website that I can't have the 'Bloody Mary vinegarette' because it isn't gluten-free. The server doesn't believe me/isn't sure what I'm talking about so insists he will get me an actual gluten free menu. Fine. He takes everyone else's order and says he will return with the menu.  *cue Jeopardy music*  I didn't get a GF menu until right before the table's food was about to come out.   I still ordered the chopped salad (without the dressing I knew I couldn't have anyways) and got it shortly after everyone else. And..it was gross. The worst part was the chopped celery - why you would put celery in that salad, I have no idea but it would have been so much better without that bitter crunch in every bite. I then had to stop eating halfway through because I had no water and there was no sign of a server in sight. Womp, womp, womp.  When the party was winding down, I was over it.  Myself and 2 other girls decided to ask for our checks, assuming that because we knew exactly what we had and were the only 3 who were ready, it wouldn't be 'too difficult' to split us off.  Nope. 25 minutes later I got my check..the same time everyone else wanted theirs too.  I'm not sure what happened last night but it was a huge disappointment. Yard House is great but I wouldn't recommend it for truly special occasions because I don't get the impression that they can deliver the kind of service those events deserve.",

I even had a toddler with me, and I've found that in Vegas, kids are not always a good trait in a customer. They were super nice.  However, when I received my French dip sandwich, I was not pleased. The meat was so fatty that I couldn't even choke it down. There are few lunchtime quirks worse than fatty roast beef! It really ruined the sandwich for me, and it's been a while since I was there. I was so disappointed! I usually love this place. I was especially disappointed that they served it to me in the first place, as it was obviously lame meat, even without taking a bite. I stopped about 3 bites in. I'm usually the very last person to ever return food, but it really was nasty.   I'm not sure I would chose to eat here again when there are many other restaurants nearby that seem to be more consistent. This location is normally slammed, so I wonder if going in when they were pretty dead was the problem. I might give it another chance sometime if I were to be invited by a friend or something, but never again will I come here for lunch.",

The manager came by & asked how we are doing & if we are enjoying it I was honest & said no lol. He offered to get us something else & even take it off the bill ... Anyways moral of my review is .... Everyone messes up , especially on a busy day like this. We aren't robots ... I am a manager & I know how it gets dealing with people from time to time so I wasn't upset that the dessert was wrong, mistakes happen ! & I thought it was very nice how our server cared , as well as her manager ... They cared enough to check on us & if we are enjoying our food & dessert even with the high volume of people in here today... That is awesome customer service ! & I definitely love this yard house location more than the one at town square ! Still one of my top fave places to eat :)",

We definitely enjoyed the hundred plus beers they had on tap along with my favorite alpine duet which was delicious.We ordered salads and we split an entree a pork chop with sweet mashed potatoes and a Bourbon cherry sauce and broccoli. Service was pretty good however our salads got to the table and about two minutes later our entrees got to the table. It is like the biggest pet peeve for me of anything because I like to sit and enjoy my salad before I eat my dinner. When they noticed that they were bringing the Entree out too soon they didn't suggest anything like remaking our entree or comping us the salad which I didn't even eat. It would've been nice to of had that comped since I didn't get a chance to eat it on my food with and cold. The pork chop dish was delicious with the exception of a little too much Sage. Sage and thyme are two of those things that you have to be careful with it cannot be too aggressive. Otherwise the entree was delicious salad would've been delicious if I'd had the opportunity to eat it before my entree shut up. Sometimes I think it's almost like you have to remind them not to placeFor your entree until you are almost done with your salad which really shouldn't be the patrons job.",

    "text": "Everyone keeps comparing this place to Cheesecake factory....I didn't see the similarities except for the vast array of dishes.  Differences weren't bad.  In fact, it was a relief that they weren't alike because Yardhouse doesn't have an occupancy in Illinois.  Stuck to the appetizers, and by far, these are winners.  There were no mixed reviews on appetizers, as people young and old enjoyed them during happy hour AND after happy hour.  That's a tell tale sign that they would pay full price for them   Dining companion and I shared the chinese garlic noodles, bernaise beef sliders and the Korean bbq beef. Each appetizer could have surely passed as an entree.  Chinese garlic noodles were buttery, savory and irresistible feel good food.  Bernaise sliders came in 4.  They meat was a little on the dry side, the bun a little too soggy.  Korean bbq beef was great.  Nice texture, not too chewy, and very well seasoned.  Accompanied with it was fluffy-ish white jasmine rice.    The dining area was Hu-Mongo!  Located in the Red Rock Casino, they didn't skimp on details with making everything giant sized,. Andre the Giant and The Rock could set next to each other size by the side in the booth and still have plenty of room for another Expendable.",

But honestly, the area that needs improvement in this establishment is the food; everything i had tasted rather bland (fried calamari, the California roll, burgers and the tacos). Some better recipes and I think this place has potential! BEER!",

    "text": "Is a beer before noon a bad idea?  Not if it's a Black and Tan or a Stout Float.  Visited the new Red Rock location on a Friday for lunch.  Managed to beat the Summerlin Power Lunchers in and got a nice booth off to the side.  I like the layout of this place, but was a little annoyed at the fact that if I entered via the Casino they made me walk the entire length of the place to the Street entrance hostess to get a seat.  Our waiter was super friendly and very helpful.  So service was a plus.  Beer selection was awesome and I will admit the only 2 other times I have been to a Yard house was for the libations and not for food.  Opted for the Stouts since it was before noon.  The place would have gotten 4 stars if the food was presented a little better.  We started with the Moo Shu Egg Rolls, Poke Stack, and Spicy Tuna Roll, then shared a Lunch portion Spicy Jambalaya.  Moo Shu Egg Rolls were great, nice combination of flavors, crispy and paired great with the sauce.  The Poke Stack was far from good quality poke and our stack was more like a landslide about ready to tumble.  Although hardly a poke expert, I've cut my share of fish in my life to know that poke should be bite size pieces of fish, not mangled rough chopped pieces of flesh (have some respect for your fish).  The Spicy Tuna Roll is a beautiful bounty of elegance, and tastes good too.  Not your traditional roll but presented in stacked layers which works.  The lunch portion of the Jambalaya only had 2 shrimp in it, and if that is their idea of blackened, someone better find their spice peddler because they are getting ripped in believing they are delivering a good creole dish when all they are serving up is some shrimp with tomato sauce over some rice.  Overall a good place for some drinks and a good time but I will definitely be trying some other dishes.",

    "text": "The newest restaurant at the Red Rock Casino, that delivers! I'm not usually a big fan of chains since I want to support my local businesses, but this place deserves a lot of credit. However, like all new restaurants this place does have some pitfalls.   @ Parmesan Crusted Chicken - Chicken was cook perfectly with a nice crusty exterior. The chicken wasn't the least bit dry like Hash House A Go Go. While the sun-dried tomatoes and 3 mushroom sauce was delicious, it felt kind of heavy and a little strong of a sauce. The mash potatoes did help to drench this strong taste. The mash potatoes was also delicious, much better than the stuff at Lawrys, but Cheesecake Factory is still my favorite.   @ Salmon Entree - I got to taste the salmon someone else in our group ordered. The salmon was good, however, it was seasoned very heavily. Almost overpowering much of the flavors of the salmon. If they used a little less seasoning, this dish would have been perfect.  @ Lobster Garlic Noodles - Someone else in our group got this. The lobster had a sweet and fresh taste. Like my parmesan crusted chicken, it was good, but the sauce was a little too heavy and they seem to salt the dish a little too much. Everything tasted good, but they need to go easy a little lighter on the sauce and seasoning. Maybe they want you to order more beer?  @ Crab Crusted Swordfish - Another person in our group got this. The swordfish was very tender and delicious. Like the other dishes, they went a little season crazy on this. The crab was very salty.   @ Macadamia Nut Cheesecake - You may be thinking you get cheesecake, with a small top layer of macadmia nuts on top. Its actually the opposite. You get a layer of cheesecake, composed of a rich base of macadmia nuts, drenched in a puddle of caramel. This desert just didn't work. The cake was very sweet, and I have a sweet tooth. They need to drizzle the caramel, instead of drenching it. Sticking to a traditional cheesecake with a cheese base and macadmia nut topping would work much better.   @ Creme brulee - This desert was good. The only issue is on the menu they claim topped with chocolate, but its actually on the base. At first I was eating it without the chocolate. Then I noticed the chocolate base and got it with my vanilla custard and notice a big improvement. This dish really needs the chocolate flavor to work.   In the food department, everything was good. There are some major concerns over the seasoning of their meats, but this could be fixed. At least nothing tasted bad. The portions is also just the right size, not like the big plates you get at Cheesecake Factory or Claim Jumpers. No leftovers for lunch tomorrow, sorry.  There is some service issues with this place. First our waitress April is a very friendly waitress, but she seem a little flustered and didn't have communication with the people bringing our food. She would come to our table to check if the food came, but it didn't come. This happened numerous times. She forgot our drinks once or twice, she dropped the forks on the ground, and came out numerous times to give us more unnecessary utensils and plates. I think she was having an off night.   The only other issue with this place is the location of the doors. If you're coming through the casino, you're actually going through the back way. While you're greeted by someone, but it seems a little odd to have to go through the entire restaurant just to get your table. The other issue is the person greeting us told us about the wait time 30-45 mins. This was no where near as accurate as they say they were. They need to work on some better communication to better accurately give an estimation. This is just really a bad, confusing, and inefficient layout with many patrons going through the backdoor to be directed to the front just to get a table. We're in the digital age of information, they should be able to seat people from the back or the front of the restaurant. The easier solution would have been to plan ahead for issues like this.  The newest restaurant at a casino that doesn't suck and is overprice. Shocking! This place does have good food, but needs to tweak the dishes just a bit. For a place thats been open for a couple of days, I'm impressed by how relatively smoothly the restaurant is running and how pack this place was on a Monday night. This place could easily be one of my favorite restaurants to go to.",

    "text": "The Yardhouse has an awesome beer selection, as good as nearly anyone in Las Vegas. We have always had great service, the food comes out very quickly, and it is a modern, fun, upbeat atmosphere.   You must try the Seared Ahi Sashimi, it is the bomb. Some of our other favorites are the chicken lettuce wraps, the truffle cheeseburger, the poke stack, and many more. We have been here 10+ times and have liked everything we've ever ordered, so I have to say two thumbs up. The Seared Ahi Sashimi has a great complexity to it, I'll save the description of the flavors to the Bourdain Types but it seriously makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  With regard to the beers, try the ever rotating list of short-termers that are posted on the screen above the bar, they keep a nice variety flowing through there and some of them have been absolute winners. If you are a fan of IPAs this place has a selection that is incredibly diverse, and you should try the Double Daddy, it is SICK.  The Happy Hours are great here, half price apps, pizzas, and discounts on every beer in the house if I remember correctly, check it out they do a great job and you always it'll be good.   Most of our visits were previous to Darden Restaurants buying Yardhouse, so hopefully the product will stay the same!",

Once I fought the redrock Parking situation (as I expected for a weekend) my wife and I made our way  to the restaurant. We got there about 35 min from making the phone call and still waited for additional 20 min. Nothing surprises me anymore,   frankly I just give my self time for these type of situations.  Anyways my wife and I sat out on the patio. We did not have any alcoholic beverages so I think are waiter was a bit annoyed bye that. ( keep the  bill low=small tip)   My wife ordered the vampire tacos and I ordered the Cuban sandwich.  Both were amazing and would definitely order it again. Our waiter did check on us a few times and made sure our ice teas were topped off.  All and all I would definitely recommend this joint and will return. The happy hour menu looks reasonable too",

This location and the location at Town Square are both very loud so I wouldn't come here for the ambiance, but the food is worth it. The fiance and I both had black truffle cheeseburgers, our usual, and they are mouth watering. We also got the lobster crab artichoke dip which lived up to its name. Overall I love this place and will definitely continue to come here for a good meal.",

I've ordered three to four plates during happy hour and it cost around 20 dollars! Now during their regular hours I've spent 50 dollars on four plates. Sitting inside the restaurant can be very loud, I've found myself yelling across the table so my friend could hear me. Outside seating wasn't as loud but since it's Vegas it is hot! Customer service is great! They're always nice and I love how they check up on you!",

Still it's all about the beer, and that is why I visit frequently.  The great selection of half priced appetizers during happy hour doesn't hurt either.",

I think that enjoying some great food and drink during happy hour is the absolute way to go at the Yardhouse, for it can be a bit pricy during regular hours.  I am a sucker for the shirmp and vodka pasta. Think there is a bit of crack in it becaus I can't stop eating it even when a button pops off the jeans. But you can get just about any dish here and adore it. I love my beer and I dig the Sunset Wheat on tap! I like to grab a few drinks after dinner on Sunday nights *happy hour* begins at 10pm!",

    "text": "First off, I must say that this review is specifically for this particular Yardhouse.  I also want to add that I am a big fan of Yardhouse in Town Square but definitely not this one!  I am writing this review after the third visit and third strike against this place.  Drove all the way across town to meet some friends and showed up at 5pm for Happy Hour.  At this time, we were told that it would be a 15-20 min wait.  One hour later we were very frustrated and still waiting to get a table!  We had a 2 y/o with us which made the wait even worse.  I have never been to a restaurant in town at 5pm and had to wait an hr to get a table and I feel this is unacceptable at this time especially when there are tables sitting empty inside!  They finally call our name and we are seated.  Our waitress comes up and we immediately see that she is a scatterbrain (says a quick hello and apologizes saying she will be right back?)  Ask to see a manager immediately to see if we can do anything about missing happy hr.  Manager comes over and is a decent enough guy who says any drinks and appetizers will be at happy hr pricing but doesn't have a reason why it took an hr to be seated?  Order drinks and it literally took 3 tries with our waitress to get our drink order right.  When she finally did, it took another 20 mins to get a pint of beer???  This continued through our meal and needless to say, we were all upset and unimpressed!  The food all arrived cold and unappealling as well.  This very poor service/waitstaff has been experienced all three times at this location and I will not be coming back.  The friends we were with go there about 3 times a week and also said they will not be returning here.  Loser here in my book that needs to really get their act together!",

    "text": "First off, I'd like to say that Yard House is our favorite go to restaurant. We were extremely disappointed with the service received on 2/15/14. The hostess told us it will be around 30min, took over an hour to be seated.  Our waitress was a bit rude and had no emotion. We figured she was being like that because we were a party of 9 and thought she would get an automatic tip, so no effort was made on her part.  She asked my mom for her id, which was expired, so my mom handed her a passport. She had to go \"double check with the manager\"  my cousin also ordered a beer and handed her a Puerto Rico license. Apparently, she did not have a TAM card or could not verify ids by her self because once again, she had to \"double check with the manager.\" She even asked my cousin for the date on the card. Has she not seen an id other than Nevada's?? When she returned, she did not inform my cousin whether or not the id was fine. He had to ask her and she said yes with an attitude.  Our drinks were empty. Warm beer. Waitress disappeared for a good while.  By the time our food came out, we still had our dirty appetizer plates. I asked her for another drink which she brought another of, yet I had to ask her to take away my previous watered down one.  My cousin asked for another beer and to please make sure it was a cold one, she did not look up from her pad and made a face.  I asked her for a box for my food and it took her around 15 minutes. I looked around, she was not with other tables.  It was my brothers birthday so she did bring out a plate of ice cream yet DID NOT OFFER US DESSERT. she dropped the ice cream off and left. Returned 10 min later and asked if we wanted any other desserts (as she pulled the check out)  Our whole dinner conversation consisted of wondering what her deal was. What type of server doesn't even attempt to get a good tip or make a good experience for their guest?? Horrible experience. Bet part about her was offering to take a picture of us.  To our surprise there was not an automatic tip on the bill which drove us even more mad because it just showed us that that's the type of server she is.  Walking out, the manager asked us how everything was and I did have to let him know and he asked a couple of questions. I saw him go and talk to her immediately.  I will not stay away because I love the Yard House, but I will not be seated with Ashley again.",

    "text": "Yard House at the Red Rock...A bit smaller than the ones in California, but that's okay. I've come to just accept that every Yard House everywhere will always be packed and crowded! Getting a drink at the bar can be just as bad as getting a drink at the bar at a nightclub. Luckily for my party of 10, we had reservations. The host told us it was a 2-Hour wait if we didn't! The music they play is pretty cool, but WAAAAYY too loud! You have to yell and read lips just to have a conversation with the person sitting right next to you! I'm all for a good vibe with good music, but please turn it down a notch or 3!!!   The food here is just okay. Granted, I haven't tried many things on the menu, but the sliders and fries I ordered came out kind of cold. I would compare the food to maybe B.J's across the street. It's just OKAY. But, the food does go well with the alcohol you'll be drinking! The only drink I order from here is their Framboise. You gotta try it! It's kind of a raspberry flavored beer that doesn't really taste like beer but probably a girly version of it. Regardless, the Framboise...get it! SO GOOD!   The service was actually pretty good. Our waitress was kind enough to ask us if we would like separate checks before taking our order, and was able to do it for us. Almost all waitresses hate doing separate checks, but thank goodness she offered it with a smile!   So next time you're there, remember to try the Framboise!",

It's much quieter, doesn't look like a party is going on like the Town Square Yard House. Both restaurants have friendly staff, great atmosphere and a plethora of drinks to be had. My favorite dish is the Miso Glazed Sea Bass. I got it on both visits to The Red Rock locale, the first time it was perfect...this time it was smaller and a bit dry, don't know if it was an off day for them or if their quality has dropped. I'll know next time I go which one is the case. So I'm giving them a pass this time. My husbands favorite is the Pepper Crusted Filet,(I don't blame him, it is delish) this time it was a little dry also. My mom got the Caesar Salad and Clam Chowder...both were average, nothing special about either. No complaints about the drinks though...",

My husband wasn't causing trouble with anyone or acting out of sorts.  He was not intoxicated. Then someone from behind the bar took my glass and did not ask me if I wanted another. Oz came by and took care of me but for my husband- the bartenders couldn't do anything without the managers permission. Also- my husband had 3 appetizers more than 1/2 eaten when I got there. The manager came up and asked if we needed a box. I WAS OFFENDED- I worked in restaurants , I felt like he was trying to get rid of us.

The Ceviche was an item I hadn't tried before and it was quite good! just know, you are going to have to dig to get everything, the presentation may look cool but it is a mess once you dive in.   Nice place whether with friends, family or business partners.",

    "text": "I wish I could give it 0 stars instead!  This is directly going towards the Bartender Sean. What else can I say? WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! I seriously don't know how management would hire douchebags like this for their company. This is coming from a person who works in the industry as well!  Went in to have a few drinks and some dessert at the bar with a couple of my friends last Thursday before a movie. Sat at the bar and waited for literally 2 mins before someone actually gave us menus after looking at us for a bit. So this guy Sean comes and drops off the menus, no greeting whatsoever, no offering of water whatsoever. He left and went to chit chat with one of his buddies behind the bar. My girlfriend had to get his attention for him to bring us waters.  Waters come in, asks \"You guys know what you want?\" One of my friends tells em not yet and he just gave this look on his face like \"WTF, hurry up\" so he leaves like hes in distress and does not come back for about 5 minutes after we were trying to indicate him that we were ready to order!  SERIOUSLY?!  This is what pissed us off the most. We were halfway through our food and my friend got his attention because she thought I needed something, so this douchebag Sean comes up to us and asks \"What, you needed something?\" with his hands up in the air, like we wasted his time from leaving him his conversation with his buddies to actually work and helping us out, like come on F*cking SERIOUSLY?!?!  I am very dissapointed with this Yardhouse location as I am a regular customer at the Town Square location. I will not be returning to this location as well as not referring anyone to this place for as long as Sean is there. Seriously you get better customer service in night clubs then at this place. I hope management stumbles upon this review and take action because I am still pissed at how this d*ck treated me and my friends.   Don't come here if you want to be treated like shit basically. Upper Management please do something about this immediately.",

But in all honesty, they are consistent no matter where you go, the food is always good and they have an amazing selection of beers that seem to vary from time to time. Also, no matter how slow or busy, their service is always on par and deserving of a four star Yelp rating.   On my most recent visit for lunch, our server was solid and the burger I ordered came out just right. My only gripe against this place is the lack of real french fries. Sorry, I don't count those weird shoe string fries but they do offer sweet potato fries if you so fancy. Overall, when all else fails and I am hungry but do not know where to go for dinner or lunch, Yard House always fits the bill. Plus they have a great happy hour also!",

They have great happy hour specials as well... such as half off pizzas, seared sashimi ahi tuna and more.    It's a comfortable environment with lots of TVs keeping you up on the latest sporting events with classic 80's tunes in the background.  A great deal and great atmosphere!",

The portions are huge and the food is delicious.   When we go for happy hour we get their chicken nachos, four cheese pizza (my two year old would kill for it!) chicken wings and chicken strips (which comes with fries)  Next time we shall get their spinach dip.  The nachos have red enchiladas sauce, guac, sour cream. Cheese, beans, and a tangy green sauce. Four cheese pizza is pretty big, more than enough for one person. I wish the crust was crispier but it was still good especially for the price. Chicken wings came in three favors and were great. 10 came on a plate. The chicken strips are very crispy but its not a usual crisp. They're light and have more of a Chinese tempora outside. The fries were thin and great.   The beers are half priced as well but I didn't try it.  They had other lunch specials and dinner specials but I shall save that for next time when I write my update!",

We were greeted by a friendly energetic server who was fairly helpful with the items on the menu. The drink menu (beer selection) was so vast that extra time was necessary. I eventually went with the house IPA in their halfyard size which is a whopping 32 ounces. The drink was delivered in a glass that was literally a half yard. So that was pretty cool. Even though it was cumbersome at times to pick up and drink, but nothing too serious.   I decided to order the Classic Cheeseburger and side of fries to go with the my house IPA.  I ordered my burger medium well. The burger was slightly over cooked I am pretty sure it was well and not medium well so you may have to go with just medium. The burger overall was fine nothing special but filled me up just fine . The Fries were great!   This place has an epic list of beers on the menu and offers a nice atmosphere with good service and pretty good food. I would recommend and especially recommend to beer advocates.",

They all checked on us several times during the meal, and I was pretty impressed with her dark beer recommendation. She even remembered what adult beverages my dad, sister and I ordered when we asked for a second round.  As for the food, their menu has a huge variety, and I haven't found anything I didn't like off of it.  Favorites are the Bernaise Sliders/Burger, Ahi Crunchy Salad, and the Grilled Korean Pork Belly Street Tacos.  Always fun to come here with a big group. Hahaha...

So does the atmosphere (to me), and (as I recently discovered) the food does as well.   Nursing my hangover we decided to head to this Yard House as it was a little closer to our house. I was craving a good turkey burger and a salad. We had previously visited the Linq Yard House location and figured this one shouldn't be too different, right? Wrong.  The turkey burger had many more extras added into the meat (veggies and such) than I had at the other location. Maybe it was a fluke, maybe not. My turkey burger was also missing arugula. The menu did look the same as the Linq location... however the service was a little off... but not enough to keep me from coming back to enjoy some tasty beers on that lovely patio!   That patio tho! Booths and bar table (comfortable) seating, plenty of tvs and lots of fans. View of the parking lot but beyond that, the mountains. If anything, go for the nice atmosphere outside and the crazy selection of beer!",

The host said that it is just a problem with their clientele; if that is the level of clientele at RR Casino or their place I do not wish to return.  Be careful or just give them a card to hold that has a very low limit or better just avoid such places.

Most of the wedding guests were staying at Red Rock, so we decided on YH to keep the dinner on property. We couldn't have chosen a better spot!! The manager, Vernice, and her staff of Summer, Brittany, Shelbie, and Stephen worked their tails off to make sure that all 50 of our guests had a wonderful night!  We decided on an appetizer buffet, and the staff replenished all evening as needed.  Drink orders were taken and served quickly with no lag in service.  At the end of the evening, the staff helped pack up food and decorations which was a great help to me.  (They also helped with the set up which saved me so much time!) This was undoubtedly the most important party my husband and I have ever thrown. Yard House made it so successful and memorable for not only us, but also for the bride and groom!",

It does get very busy and I'm not a fan of restaurants who crank the music up so loud, you have trouble hearing the person across the table from you.  That said, service is always top notch and they have been accomodating because I need a slight modification to the meal.  However, last night my burger arrived with the cheese I specifically requested be left off (can't do dairy).  I flagged our waitress, Lindsay, down and she was very apologetic and said she would have it redone.  She stopped by to let me know it was in the works.  The general manager, James, also stopped by to apologize and ensure me that it was being taken care of.  Although I was disappointed about another wait, I was very happy with how they were responding.  The burger finally arrived, it was perfect!  Lindsay stopped by to make sure I was happy and then James came by to make sure it was done right and then told me since I had to wait so long, he would comp my meal!  I would have been happy to pay for it just based on their great service.  I felt that this was above and beyond what they needed to do but was very appreciative.  Thank you, James and Lindsay, for making my day!",

Her demeanor immediately changed. \"that's why I told you (some ingredient) was in it.\" I told her I knew, and had already told her I liked it last time, it was just wrong this time. Her attitude sucked after that, everything she said from that point was with a sneer, she was totally condescending, and every time she checked on us after that, she didn't bother to even stop walking while she asked if we were good, and didn't make eye contact with any of us. Sucks, because I totally loved this one before. Still two stars because our food was good, as were our second round of drinks... Just a huge disappointment!

They also have Boddington's Irish Cream Ale as one of their over ONE HUNDRED draft beers, and that's one of my fav's. Sushi rolls are really cool here, too. Not like the small rolls cut into 6 or 7 pieces like you normally get; it's a huge one piece roll, that you can cut slices out of (almost like a pizza), or just dig into. The Ahi is great & the California is even better.",

Although I do have a great story to share. My roommate and I were eating dinner and he asked for a suggestion for a beer to which our waiter suggested a random German beer. My roommate then thought it would be clever to say \"I can't have anything German, too painful for my roommate, he's Jewish. The Germans burned him pretty bad.\" At this point our waitress looked at me with a completely lost glare on her face and said \"that's horrible!\"  The menu has recently been changed a bit but I'm not sure if it was cosmetic or if items were actually added. If you can find something that isn't absolutely delicious on the menu you've done something wrong. Their spicy jambalaya has crawfish in it which is unheard of and adds an extra level of deliciousness. If you are into eclectic burgers try the surf n' turn which includes asparagus and a lobster claw. I don't think I've had a better burger outside of Burger Bar at Mandalay. Add in their extensive beer selection, great atmosphere, and cheap prices and you basically have the best first date location you could possibly hope for. Or you have the best Sunday hangout, or Friday...or who the hell needs a reason let's just go to Yardhouse! Thank me later, I'll be in the corner having a German beer.",

We all used to play in rock bands back in LA, so a place playing classic rock seemed seemed like a good fit.  Although the place was packed - we got seated fairly quickly at a bar table in the thick of things.  I don't mind being surrounded by some hustle and bustle, but it was cold out - and every time someone opened the door out to the patio, we got hit with a blast of freezing cold air at our table.  Just a crowded restaurant trying to maximize space I guess.  Beer selection is great - I forgot my reading glasses this time so I couldn't actually READ the menu, so I just went with a Stella.   For food I got the Ahi Crunchy Salad with field greens, asian slaw and crispy wontons tossed in soy vinaigrette (according to the menu) - it was quite good.    I'm a HUGE fan of al fresco hanging out / drinking / eating, and I'm glad to see that more places in Vegas are embracing it, so I'll probably be back later in the year when it gets a bit warmer and try the patio.",

The wait was not too bad, and with the bar and sports on TV it went by even faster. The bartenders were friendly and quick, and my Longboard Ale did not disappoint. Mmmmm, beeeeeeeeer.   Once seated we decided on the Lobster Crab Artichoke Dip as an appetizer. Personally I like this with the Pita wedges so I think they need to 86 the chips on the plate and add more Pita! I highly recommend this appetizer, it's one of our favorites!   For dinner we decided to try something new. Going off positive Yelp reviews I chose the Jambalaya on Jasmine Rice. My husband went with the Chicken Garlic Noodles. We were both happy with our meals, good flavor, cooked properly, all the basics. I've never had a bad meal at Yard House so this was no surprise to me. If we have to choose, my Jambalaya was the better of the two (Katie FTW, yet again!).   I love bringing a large group to Yard House, we came here for my pre-bachelorette party dinner :) and that was yet again another great Yard House experience.   I recommend Yard House for quality food and beer, it is consistent, family or large group friendly and they have a large, diverse menu.",

I've had most of the menu, the only thing I really won't eat again is the turkey burger - it just seemed so weird to me - but the jambalaya is awesome, the regular burgers are standard, the apps are good...

    "text": "We frequent the Yard House at Town Square and Red Rock pretty often, but last night was the first time we had the new menu. There were 4 of us and we decided to order several appetizers and share. The chicken nachos are soooo good. Possibly best nachos ever. There are 2 sauces...a green and a red, beans, chicken, guacamole, sour cream and CHEESE! Real shredded cheese, not processed cheese sauce. There goes the diet.   I read a few reviews on yelp and several people raved about the searing ahi so we tried that, as well as the hummus, garlic noodles, shrimp lettuce wraps & mushroom lettuce wraps. The hummus was ok, but on the salty side. The tuna was disappointing to say the least. The last piece I put in my mouth had such a repulsive texture I had to spit it out immediately. I guess its a good thing the texture was so fowl because if I had swallowed it I probably wouldve gotten food poisoning. It seems like the tuna is previously frozen (and possibly artificially dyed bright pink) and wasn't great overall, but that one piece was absolutely disgusting.  I didn't have any of the lettuce wraps, but my friends said the mushroom ones were super salty...bordering on inedible.  The garlic noodles were decent.  We really like Yard House, but I think it tries to have a menu to please everyone instead of sticking to what they do really well--bar food.  The bf loves the giant selection of beers and the service is always very good. I'm going to steer clear of the Asian menu items and stick with my favorite bbq chicken salad...or when I want to splurge, the chicken nachos.",

No one was really at the front when we entered, but we found our relatives pretty quick because they were all seated at a booth near the front. The service was kinda weird here. I ordered passion fruit iced tea and my relatives all got drinks from the bar. They all got their drinks first and I had to wait a while for my tea. We also ordered an Ahi tuna stack and we got that before I got my iced tea. It was kinda annoying because I was super thirsty. A couple minutes after we got our appetizer my iced tea finally came. It kinda tasted off though, like a diet iced tea, bleh. I ended up just drinking water for the rest of the time we were there.   The Ahi stack was ok. The tuna was good, the wontons tasted like they were fried in old oil though and there was just a huge amount of daikon and carrots that were pretty bland. The sauce on the plate was a really gross brownish green color that wasn't very pretty. It was a wasabi soy sauce, it tasted good though, not too overpowering.   I haven't been to a Yard House in a while and they've really redone their menu. There's a lot of interesting stuff on their menu that I actually wanted to try. I didn't get to this time around though because we planned to go to dinner somewhere else. I might actually try out Yard House again to check out their new menu.",

I started out with the Pineapple Express cocktail (which I loved so much I stopped by Total Wine to pick up the ingredients) and ordered the Baja fish tacos. I had never ordered a vampire style taco before so I ordered one regular and one vampire just to give it a try. My only regret is not ordering two vampire style tacos! For those that don't know, vampire style is where the melt cheese directly onto the skilled and then place the tortilla on top; the end result is a crunchy cheese coated bit of tortilla heaven!  The service was great too! At one point the people at my table were in the middle of an exciting story and I noticed the server about to approach the table. The server turned around, waited a couple minutes for the story to be finished, and then came to ask how everything was. Total All-Star!  Will definitely be back!",

We went on and found ourselves at the bar where we ordered food and drinks promptly. The service was fast and the food hot.   However, the quality was less than favorable. The turkey burger was dry.. very dry! The appetizer, chicken wraps, was ground chicken that appeared to be grocery store packed worth no flavor. Side sauces could be added but they lacked flavor as well. Not to mention the cost was strip level ($65.00 for 2).   Casey, a male bartender,  kept hiring on the girl next to us. He was using vulgar language like F*** bombs and S***. My fiance called him out toward the end of the meal at which point he comped a drink and disappeared for the evening. My better half pointed out that if it weren't for Shelby, the other bartender and only reason this is 2 stars, we would have  walked out and made a scene in the process.   Never again Yard house! NEVER!!",

On a previous visit we got there at 5:55pm and asked if we could still take part in the happy hour which ends at 6pm. They said it was fine, as we had arrived before 6pm and they would be seating us in a few minutes. At 6:05pm they seated others who came in after us. They forgot about us, which wasn't a big deal, and got us seated right away with the happy hour pricing once we brought it to their attention.   Fast forward the year end, and we go at 5:30pm and the wait is now 15-25minutes. The people in the front won't guarantee happy hour pricing, and when told that it was done for us in the past, said we would have to ask the server we get. We waited maybe 5 minutes as we stewed on...\"Why the heck should we wait almost half an hour for a pricing we may or may not even get, which is why we came in the first place???\"  To the front people: Call the manager if you don't know or aren't sure.",

It's a good vibe and not ridiculously overpriced.  Last time I went, I had the cobb salad (basic, much like the pumpkin spice reference, I know) and it was great - it had a couple things (like edamame) that took it up a notch as well.    Things that are great here: sweet potato fries, basically all the appies, and of course - the beer.  If you're looking for a great sports bar or a nice lunch spot, Yardhouse is legit.",

There is a full bar and lots of beers on tap. Appetizers are delish, as is most of the food we've ordered.  The service this time at Red Rock Yard House was less than stellar. Our waitress was a sweetheart, but repeatedly forgot our kids menus, forgot the ketchup for the fries, forgot my salad (everyone was done when I finally saw her to tell her), our bill took forever to finally come.  Luckily, their food is pretty good, so we'll probably go back.",

Do not get surprised with how generous the portions are, even at discounted rate.  I highly recommend their poke nacho.  I also liked cheese curd and BBQ pizza.    The service was fast and attentive.  I normally do not really care for franchised restaurants much but Yard House I can see why people like it.  I live in Hawaii and never bothered to go to Yard House in Waikiki but I might make my way next time.",

Seated we Lucked out in getting Ryan and he was perfect with a great personality. The steak we ordered had a special potato tower which was absolutely fantastic and the insides of it was just wonderful. Our steak was cooked to perfection and our Kudo's to the chef. Overall it was a Great Experience for us as sometimes in Vegas some restaurants tend to stretch themselves out which makes for a bad meal. The manager stopped by & I told him how we were treated and how good the food was and he smiled big time. If your looking for a great meal with Super Service stop by the  Yard House in Red Rock Casino Hotel. You will Not be Disappointed.",

Our main bartender was Josh, super nice guy, he took our orders and had our food out pronto. We ordered chicken nachos and fried cheese curds, both were delicious!

From Cocktails, Appetizers & Entrees for a table fit for a Queen(s), we truly enjoyed our dining & food experience.   I'd guesstimate that 20% of the team tried the highly recommend Nashville Fried Hot Chicken that comes with Sweet Potato Pancakes & Honey Hot Sauce. By the time I made my way to their plates to snap a picture it was already devoured LOL.  For a Resort, the prices are extremely manageable, Hot Chicken $17 & the Rib Eye $28 to highlight just a minuscule of  the menu offerings. The restaurant is huge with a spacious Bar, various places to sit & an enclosed bricked fence patio with a wonderful view of the Red Rock Mountains.   We absolutely house partied at the Yard & had a good time.",

    "text": "We stopped by Yard House to enjoy their Happy Hour that's til 6pm on weekdays and we weren't disappointed!  I find this location better than some of their others because it seems lighter, brighter, more spacious and can accommodate a lot of people without feeling too claustrophobic. They have great sized booths and bar space as well as high and low tables and outside space, so you can choose whichever you like, all are great!  Service was great and all were accommodating, kind and friendly, from host, server, the person dropping off our food and even a Hawaiian guy who I think was the manager. Server stopped by enough to ensure we were getting on well and the manager was so lovely - I love that he acknowledged the diners as he was doing the rounds.  We went for a cocktail and an ale which were $2 off menu price during HH. The cocktail was strong but full of flavour and the beer was good too.  HH was relevant to appetisers and they were all half price, which worked out to be great value! We went for the sliders - 4 came with cheese and a great sauce as well as fries. It was delicious! My partner and I both commented how they were some of the best restaurant appetisers we'd tried. Not greasy, full of flavour and substantial enough. Definitely our favourite and we'll always get these from now on!  The chicken nachos were also really good and was a huge portion. Lots of chicken too.  Lastly we went for the cheese pizza. This was a little more simple. It looked like something you'd buy from the frozen section of the supermarket and the cheese tasted a little plastic. It was well seasoned but so greasy I had to take a napkin to it before eating it. Not bad, but I'm not sure I'd order that one again.  Overall, Yard House is a great casual dining spot to enjoy sports, go for a date night or socialise with friends. Their staff are great and really make you feel welcomed and the Happy Hour is great value!  We'll be back!",

Fish & chips was an impressive plate as always and I left satisfied overall.   The poke nachos were a different story - the amount of tuna that came on the poke nachos was uninspiring. When we noticed this we decided to raise the issue, which our waitress Cristina elevated  to the floor manager Kevin. Kevin arrived with a ramekin full of tuna and apologized, stating it was a flagship appetizer and he wanted to make sure it was up to our standards. This is the level of service we expect, and we felt Kevin understood that immediately.    Cristina deserves an exclusive mention for the excellent service throughout our meal.",

It gives it a very romantic touch, especially if you are in a corner inside a booth with your special someone.  The ladies in the front greeted us right away and they were very friendly, we were seated and our server came by pretty quick. She let us know about the specials and answered the questions we had about the mules.

Tonight I enjoyed lettuce wrap tacos, and boy- they were phenomenal. I'm a sucker for fresh ingredients, and that's exactly what I was given. Personally, I would return just for these! We also enjoyed a mini trio of desserts. Equally as delicious. Service was great, atmosphere was also great. A cool grille & bar vibe. Thanks a bunch, Yard House!",

Our table got the Club Sandwich, the Maui Pineapple Chicken, and the Orange Chicken Bowl. They usually add a few items to their menu every now and then to keep things interesting. When we went they've just added Korean BBQ.  Yard House is a good solid choice for lunch and dinner alike.",

From walking in the door and waiting to be seated to paying the bill and getting my to-go box the service has been great. Even when they are slammed and I have to wait for a table the staff has taken good care of us.  We are big fans of the variety of beer on tap and the lobster garlic noodles are a staple at my table. I usually visit with a variety of people with different beer preferences and they offer something for everyone at the bar. My server, Jerri, also did a good job of making some drink reccommendations after we found out that they were actually out of one of the brews on the menu.   I've ordered the seared sea scallops and orzo pasta with wild mushrooms and white truffle sun-dried tomato sauce twice. The first time it was really good, which is why I ordered it again. The second round was just ok. Not as good as I remembered it. The sea bass is pretty good and I really like the organic tomato and basil bisque. The bisque is consistent, you can't go wrong. I will be back soon and I will order it again.",

    "text": "About the best thing I can say about the food at Yard House at the Red Rock Casino is that they have a very good beer menu! If you like bar food, the Yard House has an extensive menu of offerings, but everything we recently tried was less than mediocre.  There are much better bar food restaurants out there....  Our party of four shared two appetizers:  Fried calamari, which was the worse fried calamari I've ever had.  Overcooked and with absolutely no seasoning, it was bland, dry and disgusting.   Lobster, crab and artichoke dip with chips and pita, which had an unusual flavor, not quite crab dip and not quite artichoke, and lost somewhere in the middle. Pretty bad....one taste was enough for me.   For entrees we tried:  Steak sandwich, which had a very tough and flavorless cut of beef in a bun filled with fried straw onions. Awful.  Turkey pot pie, which had an undercooked pastry crust and served in a dish that seemed as big as a wagon wheel. Way too much food although it was filled with tasty chunks of turkey and veggies. Not bad, not good, but edible.   Crunchy Ahi Salad, which had decent quality Ahi that was seared quite nicely.  This was the best dish we received.   Fish and chips, which were greasy and sort of bland. Edible but not a lot going for it.  Service was good, and again the beer was great.  The waiter removed the calamari from the bill after I told him it was tasteless.   We won't be back, except maybe for a beer.",

    "text": "Ordered app's for a group of 4 local residents during a late lunch today.   Chicken Nachos: chicken was so dry you could barely chew it, like it had been sitting under the salamander for an hour, cheese was cold and rubbery, the only fresh food on the plate was the guac and the sour cream.   Coconut shrimp: Over deep fried as they were practically black and what's with the plating? You can't spare a little more sauce? I mean it's just drizzled on the plate with some sort of veggie sticks.    The real disappointment was the famous spinach artichoke dip that I used to love, but now it's a smaller portion and the taste was forgettable.   The place was not packed for a Sunday afternoon, but the service was slow. Took nearly 45 minutes to get app's, had to send the chicken strips and fries back because it was cold, and wait another 20 minutes for a cup of chicken noodle soup that our guest didn't have time to eat and left.  Waitress was polite but seemed distracted, so the service suffered, but overall I wouldn't go back because it's all about the food, and the food was not good.  Living in Vegas gives you the opportunity to have many great dining experiences and I think that for the prices The Yard House is asking, they could get their act together on simple bar food.",

It wasn't as busy as the other Yard House, in Town Square, but that's probably due to the fact that I went the second day that they opened but they were still pretty busy, considering. I'm almost positive that they'll have a 1-2 hour wait VERY soon...   We parked outside, not in the parking garage so we were able to walk up to the front of the restaurant from the outside. The beautiful fountain/endless waterfall thing is there, it's real nice! Inside was real nice as well but I wasn't able to walk over to the other entrance from the inside of the hotel so can't comment on that. As in any Yard House, TVs for sports!   Our server was Ricky, he was an AWESOME server. Knew the menu, inside and out it seemed! We went for HH (M-F 3-6pm & Sun-W 10-Close) and they have awesome items on the menu. We ordered 2 Kona Longboard Beers, 2 Guiness, Chinese Garlic Noodles, Hawaiian Poke Stack, Margherita Pizza and Classic Sliders. The portions are like at any Yard House, not tiny but it wouldn't hurt to get 2 appetizers to get full, if you're there for HH.   We'll be returning! I'm so excited that we don't have to drive all the way to LV BLVD to enjoy me some Yard House!",

Enjoyed the Woodchuck Pumpkin Cider as well as their House White Ale and a Hoegaarden.   Lobster dip was also good, with plenty of pitas and chips to dip.  So why only three stars?  Unfortunately it is due to poor customer service from management.   I politely asked Jocelyn if I could have the tv above the bar turned to a college hoops game as there was no one on my corner of the bar.  She was happy to ask the two managers working on the tap system to change it for me.  They both told her they were busy with the taps and \"she could do it if she wanted to.\"   I'm not a brewmaster so I have no idea how many white shirts it takes to fix a tap system but I am familiar with proper customer service and that's not it.   I politely waited 40 minutes (the entire first half of the game) to inquire again.  Jocelyn apologized saying she had thought management had gotten to it.  She asked once again and 30 minutes later....still nothing.  I eventually just moved to a table in view of a tv showing the game.  Not a huge deal but certainly annoying.   Hence the minus two stars.",

I've also been to the Red Rock location several times for post work pints, which are less torturous.  Yardhouse is a chain, and the two locations are largely comparable. No miracles here, no surprises, no shocks. The beer list is pretty amazing, and so if I'm going here in a small group, it'll be for some sort of weird belgian quadrupel.   Where yardhouse shines is the \"middleground\". It's a great place to go with a fussy group, or if you can't decide. There's pretty much an option for everyone- vegetarian, carnivore, no carb, the works. The price point is a little bit high, but if you've been dragged along, there are affordable options, as well as the \"impress the date you don't know at all\" sort of pricing. The food is actually shockingly good for a chain, most of the time, too. I have a had a few \"yep, that was a formula. bluh\" meals; the avacado, pepper, dry chicken and corn flatbread. That was a flavorless mess of huge chunks of slippery veg. I really don't want to feel like I have to cut a pizza-again to eat it.  But the fries are fantastic; probably one of my favorites of all time. I have no idea why. It is simply so. The soups are always spot on. The tomato bisque and the French onion are perennial favorites, and the lunch soup and salad/sandwich combo is a pretty affordable meal.",

Three other parties came in and were seated before us (they were not asked to sit down).  My wife and I observed this and my wife asked Lauren when our table would be ready.  Lauren asked her how many was her party for again and did we want to sit inside or outside.  Really did not make us feel that the Yardhouse was interested in our business so we went elsewhere and let the manager know on our way out why we were leaving.  He (did not catch the manager's name) wanted to know how many were in our party and he would get us a table right away.  Apparently you do not have to count past one to work at the Yardhouse and need to give your party size more than three times.  This local is not going back.",

We got our food from one of the runners my girlfriend had the pot pie which look like a 16 inch pizza and I had the angel hair pasta I noticed however it didn't look the same as before but I haven't been here in quite a while as we begin to eat I did notice that the angel hair pasta seems a little spicier than normal I would notice this is I have acid reflux my girls food however it was wonderful pot pie was cooked to perfection nice light fluffy crust big thick chicken and vegetables as we're eating our way to mark came over and asked us how are food was he knew exactly the menu items we were eating explain to me that the angel hair pasta had changed and know exactly about my girls pot pie I must say this was one of the most attentive waiters I have ever come across he never let my t ever get close to being out as he gave me three and my girls t as well being it was close to 11:30 closing time I figured that this gentleman would be a little upset I don't know very attentive to our table and kept making sure we were happy and if we wanted the desert he brought the check I wish I could have tipped more I only give them 11 dollars however but he was so worth the money I give this review 5 stars because of Marc the waiter....I like the pasta the old way",

Amazing beer selection, I think I probably got around to trying a third of them before moving to AZ, where I also happen to live about 10 minutes from a yard house.

My only negatives are it can get quite noisy if you're trying to hang out with people and even at happy hour their prices are a bit high.  But your paying for selection and quality I suppose.",

I asked for soup and they told me they was closed BUT shelbie went out of her way to go to the kitchen and graciously got me a bowl of tomato bisque before they were going to throw it out and stop serving. my birthday was October 1st and I came all the way from long beach to stay at red rock casino with my mom to celebrate and it was well worth it. I had multiple drinks at the bar to celebrate my 21st and Josh took AMAZING care of us and made my birthday fun with innovative new shots and attending to me consistently making sure we were good. he was the first person in Vegas to card me so it was fun :) I used to work at yard house at the pike so I know the hours are long and they stay open late so I am sooooo appreciative of Shelbie catering to my drunkenness friday night (Oct 3rd) and getting me the most delicious tomato bisque soup (plus bread and crackers!!!) about 5 mins past 1am. employees like that are an amazing assets to the yard house team and Josh (the trainer and bartender) and shelbie (the waitres) should be recognized for their sincerity and great attitudes. I am impressed with yard house at red rock casino and would definitely return!! thank you! I am so happy I am eating my tomato bisque as I write this haha.. thank you for an amazing birthday and delicious drinks and food. MUCH LOVE ! xoxo :) 5 stars and will return.",

    "text": "This was not my first trip to Yardhouse's happy hour by any means and I'd say that each visit is quite similar (star-wise). It's just that when I get 3 drinks in me, the experience gets ramped up a bit, the food tastes better, and I forget how mediocre everything was.   My husband and I caught the Happy Hour last night and our server Cristian was really nice and helpful with the menu selection. My husband asked him what a really strong, decent tasting beer was and upon recommendation, he ended up choosing the North Coast PranQster. It was unfortunately a bit sweet for his taste buds and then we saw Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale and wondered why our server didn't recommend that because we knew the reputation of Bastard beers.  So my husband downed his goblet and ordered the Bastard Ale. We got it and realized exactly why he didn't recommend it. It tasted like absolute crap! On a scale of disgusting brews, $1.25 Earthquake High Gravity Lager from a gas station with 12% alcohol content, comes in at a 10 for the most disgusting beer on the planet. Now, this Bastard Ale, even at happy hour prices, is 4 times the cost and a gnarly 9.5 on the disgusting beer-o'-meter. Moral of the story: listen to your server about beer recommendations; they seriously know their stuff.   Onto the food! We ordered gardin(soy) chicken wings with buffalo sauce, chicken nachos, spicy Thai chicken pizza, and seared ahi sashimi. We opted for the gardin because I wanted to boost my soy intake for the day. They were battered perfectly and tasted pretty much like chicken. As they cooled, the tofu side came out more, but I didn't care because I love tofu anyway. The sauce is a really delicious typical buffalo sauce and the ranch was tasty. The chicken nachos were HUGE. The plate had to be close to 2 ft long and it was covered in nachos with all the goods: pico, sour cream, pinto beans, guacamole, cheese, salsa, and chicken. My only complaint about this dish was the chicken. They were pretty large strips and not many of them, which wasn't a bad thing because they were definitely on the chewy side.  The seared ahi was alright. I've always loved the sauce on that dish. I can't explain it other than being spicy, refreshing, and a perfect complement to raw fish. However, I found the fish to have some fat or tissue which was hard to cut through and seemed of a lesser standard than what you would find at a sushi joint. Lastly, the spicy Thai chicken pizza. We had to send it back for a different pizza. It was really salty because of the peanut sauce plus all the salty toppings made it salt overload. We replaced it with a pepperoni mushroom which is pretty fail-proof and it was the typical mediocre Yard House pizza with soggy center and all.   You know those places that you go to once every 3 months because they have a great environment and service so you forget about how mediocre the food is? I think Yard House is one of those places if you plan on being sober. However, it is excellent for beer and vegetarians!",

We opened our menus to the first page and spent about ten minutes deciding which beer to try. I chose the New Castle/Guinness blend, which was hearty and delish. My girl-date chose the Blue Moon/Guinness blend--also delish, and much lighter.  Then we got to the food menu. It's pretty much like going to the Cheesecake Factory (tons of choices.) They have a veggie-based meat substitute that can be put into any one of SIXTEEN of their dishes. I finally settled on the spicy chicken sandwich. It was definitely spicy, but very good. It came with a pile of very thin fries, which I dipped in our guacamole after we ran out of chips. I hate to waste good guacamole.  I just realized that the waiter boxed up my fries for me and I think I forgot them on the table. Sad. :( I guess I'll have to go back for more. :D",

It is bright red and tastes like a full-bodied fruity beer. The half price apps are a marvelous deal! The crab cakes are delightful, a little bit heavier than I prefer, yet tasty nonetheless. The spicy tuna roll is my standby because it is consistently delicious. It is a deconstructed roll of course and it's enough for 2 to share. Another favorite is the Chinese garlic noodles. It's egg noodles sauteed with garlic, butter and shitaake mushrooms, YUM! The poke stack is also delectable. They also honor the lunch specials until 5pm. I tried the lunch portion of the mac and cheese, as it came highly recommended by a friend of mine. I found it to be too heavy. The flavors weren't bad, it just left me feeling like I had a bowling ball in my belly. I think the mix of the chicken and the mushrooms and the cream sauce are just too much.   The atmosphere is loud here, as it is a bar. The outside dining on the high tops is much more reticent. The weather in the afternoons lately has made it a perfect spot to nosh and enjoy a beer.",

We opted for outdoor seating and were taken to a section completely to ourselves. We ordered the Duck Fat Fries with Bacon and Caramelized Onion Dip - YUM!! We wanted to order a beer but were overwhelmed by all the choices. Our server asked what styles we liked, made recommendations and brought us samples. We loved what we got. We decided to order a couple of appetizers instead of entrees since there were so many things on the menu we wanted to try! I got the Duck Wings and Hubby ordered the Calamari. Both were Outstanding!! I happened to mention that we were celebrating my birthday and our server brought me a Mini Dark Chocolate Souffle that was Divine!! We will definitely be back and next time I will be ordering the Pastrami Benedict!!",

    "text": "First thing is first - I'm not sure why they have \"entrances\" from inside Red Rock Casino, but on the night we visited, we were waiting at what we found out was the BACK of the restaurant.  A bus girl had to tell us that the front desk is across the restaurant to get a seat.  My wife and I visited this place tonight and we had a pleasant time.    To drink, I had a water (from the tap) w/ lemon and she had an iced tea.  The ice tea was unsweetened.  The waitress did a good job of keeping our glasses full.  For an appetizer, I ordered the Ahi Poke Bowl.  I am a poke nut and I was satisfied.  For the price, the portions seemed correct.  It was served with two large chip wafers, guacamole, been sprouts and macadamia nuts.  It was very delicious.  We had a chance to share the Maui Chicken (Chicken breast, grilled in a great tasting sauce, brown rice and roasted vegetables).  I loved it!  We also had a 12oz Ribeye Steak ordered medium well  that came with mashed potatoes and roasted green beans.  The mashed potatoes were bland and dry.  We traded that in for an extra helping amazing of green beans.  Clam Chowder was a side dish that seemed like a bit much with the portions of food from our main entree.  Nevertheless, the small serving was rich and creamy.  Not sure why it seemed to take some time to get our main entrees, but it did take a while.  The place did not seem so busy at the time.  My total experience here would be a 4/5.  Speed of Food preparation 3/5 Food 4/5 Service 5/5 Cleanliness 5/5",

    "text": "While the new Yard House location at Red Rock has a great location, super comfortable patio even in the summer, and the same menu as all the other locations, it was still a disappointment. My Boyfriend and I were there last weekend and unfortunately the selection of staff doesn't seem to have been done with the same amount of care and discretion as it was in other locations throughout the valley.   We were quoted a 45 minute wait time, and went to the bar for our first beer. They didn't have what I ordered, but the bartender didn't seem to know of any similar options (even though there are 3 or 4 on the menu). We were sat in about 15-20 minutes (one star earned there) and so took a few minutes to finish beer #1 and decide on #2. I decided to venture out of the normal and try one of the Yard House blends. When I asked our server about a specific option, she replied \"Oh, I don't know, I don't drink beer.\" Then proceeded to go on and on about how it has too many calories and makes you fat. So  A) Thanks, you're calling me and my boyfriend (we're both pretty in shape people) fat cows for wanting to enjoy a tasty beverage? B) You work in a restaurant that specializes in a certain product, and you don't know ANYTHING about it? At least fake it till you make it next time, OK?  What I ended up ordering wasn't at ALL what I was expecting and basically tasted like strawberry juice (since I obviously didn't get any information on it from our server) and I was pretty disappointed with it. When the manager came by to check on our table, I asked for a sample size of the less sweet part of the blend, to try to make it more bearable. She begrudgingly complied, brought it back 10 minutes later and then never came back to make sure it was satisfactory. Not HORRIBLE behavior, but a good manager would have been a little more attentive.   The food was about the same as the Town Square location, but since the service was not even close to comparable, I would definitely not make this one a first choice again.",

The other night one of the waitresses kept .33 cents change (total bill $19.67, gave a hundred and got 80 back.).  This is stealing.  It also forces you to alter your tip amount to give either a low tip or a high tip as the change can make the difference between 10% and 18% on a low bill like this one.  Not to mention for people like me who give the change to my daughter to save in her bank, it is very disappointing.  Word to the wait staff here.  You don't have a right to receive a tip, it is up to the customer to determine if you earned one and how much.  I usually give 20% or more but next time, if you take my change, that is your choice of what tip you deserve and I will not give you any more..",

This location has the smallest selection out of all the locations I have been to...its a disappointment. Most people are like \"oohhhhh look at all the beers\"..and get the same couple of lame ass beers time and again but I like to swtich it up.

Although, this was my first time and I really haven't got a chance to taste the menu, I still recommend coming here. In fact, there is a Yard House that just opened up back in San Jose and I'll definitely being going there for sure.   Me and the wifey shared a meal, we had the Jambalaya with rice. It wasn't as spicy that I expected, but boy was it yummy. What was kind of ehhh was my sons food, he ordered the Mac N' Cheese and it tasted a bit weird, maybe it's because I'm use to eating Mac N' Cheese from the box or Yard House's Mac N' Cheese was just odd. It had a weird texture to it that I really wasn't comfortable eating. My son also had clam chowder to go with his meal, that was good, but I still rather goto a warf to getting chowder.  I seriously need to try more off their menu (poki, ahi, sushi/sashimi looks yummmmy), and this place just might be my all time favorite restaurant to eat at. This place does get packed at night on the weekends and when I say packed, I really mean it gets PACKED! So I wouldn't recommend coming here around those times if you're really hungry.  JERK WINGS + FRESHLY BREWED BEER = SATISFIED!",

The music was extremely loud which prohibited talking to other people at my table.    Although the restaurant was extremely busy, our server Lauren greeted us quickly and brought our drinks right away.  We ordered the Ahi appetizer which was brought out incredibly fast.  The appetizer was delicious.  For dinner I ordered the turkey burger and substituted vegetables instead of fries.  The burger was incredibly moist and flavorful.  This was the best turkey burger I have ever had.  I would definitely order it again.    Lauren was one of the best servers I have had in Las Vegas.  I probably will not return to this restaurant during peak hours.  Tables should not be place so close to the waiting area during peak times because it ruins an otherwise awesome meal.",

I ordered the Bbq bacon cheddar burger with fries. It's the Yard House and my expectations werr high because I've heard such great things about this place and it's ALWAYS crowded.   Well, big let down. Bbq bacon cheddar burger, with the name you'd think it would have some kind of sauce or seomthing? Nope. Dry as the desert I live in. Bacon. I like mine not so over cooked and a bit chewy. It was so over cooked I think I broke a tooth!!  I was not pleased with this experience. We visit Red Rock Casino however I will NEVER eat at the Yard House again!!!  Maybe I'll try Lucille's which is right next door.  By the way, the servings were mediocre.

    "text": "So...had another date night with my favorite paid male escort.  He has a huge....appetite. He's not a cheap date. We got there right before last call for food.  We got Calle (like the state Cali, not the street in Spanish) who was very accommodating at the last minute, got us everything we needed. Basically, she was awesome and we are going to ask for her again!   Let's talk turkey. Actually, that is about the only thing my paid male escort for the evening did NOT get. It was happy hour. Happy hour means (usually) small plates so you better order a bunch at the Yard House this is NOT True. You get normal sized meals at happy hour prices. There was so much food in our table that I couldn't get all of it in the photo.   Let's just start off easy. I had a Bikini Tini. Loved it. Cheese curds. (I had them before and have fantasized about them since, don't tell anyone but at one point I was looking at photos of them on the Internet as though there were illicit adult content.) Loved those.  Okay, now to know me is to know I love dessert. I am a fat kid who loves cake. Well I had the SALTED CARAMEL BUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING. Um. Foodgasm, anyone? If you happen to be lonely and can't afford the paid male escort of the evening like I can, come here, get this dessert, it's almost better. I can say TOP 5 DESSERTS OF MY LIFE!  My escort he got...everything. No not everything... He got deviled eggs. Not his favorite, he said they were fancy. He's used to my plain old mayo and egg version, theirs had horseradish, cumin and had salsa and bacon on it. He had sliders. Okay they are good, but come on, this is a burger cut in quarters! Nice try YH, but you can't fool me! French Onion Soup. He said it was good but needed more salt. He got wings, he said they were hot and didn't want them to touch his lips. He got fries and had canon seasoning put on...I like my fries plain.  But I wanted to try a couple and 50 fries later, yup, you guessed it they were quite tasty... And he also got a buffalo chicken pizza. We boxed that to bring home. It looked good but we haven't tasted it yet.  He also got two margaritas and a coke. All expertly made/poured.   And now we are at home wondering why did he get all that food? If you kept a tally...  3 alcoholic drinks 1 soda 1 cheese curd  1 pizza 1 cup of soup 1 order of 10 wings 1 order of sliders 1 side of fries 1 order of deviled eggs 1 cup of French onion soup 1 dessert  Bill total:  $71.08.  SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! I have paid more at other places that are terrible. Spend your money wisely YH is where you can get a good meal! AND if you like beer 130 are in tap.   Remember salted caramel butterscotch pudding.",

    "text": "Went here for me and my husband's anniversary. We were going to T-Bone's but I wanted more of a laid back atmosphere and had a craving for beer. I ordered their 21st anniversary beer and it was delicious! I can't remember the alcohol percentage but I ended up only ordering 1 but planned on getting 2 lol (I'm a lightweight/cheapdate)   I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken with sweet potato pancakes and shared truffle fries with hubby. The pancakes weren't very good. The chicken was to die for though!! He ordered the sandwich version. We were both so happy with our food, service and drinks. So much that I took my mother-in-law the following Wed. for lunch.  I expected the same quality in food and service. Our waitress Kristyn was pleasant and she looks like Mila Kuniz! I ordered Calamari to start and it came right away. It was freshly cooked however a tad overcooked. I still saved the rest to take home for my kiddos and Darlene was so sweet to wrap it up for me and say \"I appreciate you!\" That made my day.   I loved my meal! I got the truffle cheeseburger and fries. yummmmy, unique and cooked perfectly. However, my mother-in-law barely ate her french dip roast beef sandwich because the meat was so tough. (She also has braces) We had to send it back. The manager Jen, came right away and she was so genuine and kind. She offered to replace a meal but we were pressed for time as we had a bingo game to get to lol. We did opt for a free Birthday mini-dessert. My MIL ordered the chocolate souffle and I ordered a Creme Brulee. The chocolate Souffle came out first and my MIL gave me a bite. It was more like a brownie than a souflee but it was still good. The Creme Brulee had a candle and they made a cocoa powder design that said \"Happy Birthday\" It was really pretty. Darlene even sang me a birthday song lol it was soooo cute! The Creme Brulee was more like a banana pudding with a chocolate crust. Not a fan. Regardless, I had a nice visit, and will come again because of the excellent service, food and great atmosphere.",

It was obvious that it was more of a burden. Which I get it's a pain in the a** but you as a employee you should NEVER make it seem like a burden in front of the Customer. Allison was very rude.   2. WAITED 30 minutes to be seated on an empty patio- which probably was empty in the first place, which was never an option until I asked for the 3rd time.   3. Didn't get our drinks/apps for some time. Never saw the waiter more then 3 times during our entire hour and half stay.   4. Everyone had ordered and received their food within 30 mins. EXCEPT ME (THE HOST) no runner, waiter, etc. even asked about our food or if we were okay. I sat there without a plate the ENTIRE time.    After everyone was done- they finally came to collect everyone's finished plates and that was when they realized- I had no food...it was quite impressive the lack of customer service that was displayed.   Manager came over said he wouldn't charge for the food I wasn't even given (irony). But he was extremely sorry- after talking with the manager he offered a $50 gift card which would be mailed in 2 weeks.  This experience was unbelievably bad....I might never go to this location again because of this reason. I will be contacting corporate/regional manager with names about this terrible experience.   Just a warning- you may not get food.....",

Our waitress' were super friendly per usual(Our original waitress went home and we got a replacement). took 1hour and 20 min before we got our food. My sisters kids were turning into the snickers commercial.  After 45 min - my sister asked the new waitress if the kids meals were coming. Waitress got the manager.  He told us our food was delivered somewhere else and they were making our food now. Had we not asked the waitress where our food was ... would anyone have ever noticed we hadn't  gotten our food? It was just super annoying because we had 2 hungry kids and The unexpected 2 hour lunch almost made me late for my doctors appointment.  Manager comped our meal for the inconvenience - it was a nice gesture and I know shit happens but still annoying.",

The husband and I stopped here after a day of hiking at Red Rock Canyon. We were super hungry and Yard House was the first thing we saw so we stopped. The parking lot was pretty full, but we found a spot towards the back.  We were seated immediately (it was like 3:30 pm) and our server Nicole cheerfully greeted us and proceeded to take great care of us. Our beers were always delivered cold and promptly. She always made sure our water glasses were full. We both had the tacos (chicken tinga and fish) with rice and beans. Delicious food (I think the fish were my favorite)!!!!! Nicole even gave us plastic cups to take our beer into the casino when we were done. Next time I'm in town, I'll definitely stop here again.",

We were in for some serious eating after a long day of work, and well deserved too! Our waiter was kind enough to move us to a bigger table to accommodate all of the dishes we were about to order. Im sure he was probably thinking to himself... these girl have no idea what they got themselves into lol little did he know we came to feast, literally!  We all ordered a beer to start and for food we ordered two poke nachos, fried calamari, onion tower, sliders, fried mac&cheese, sashimi, and pizza. My favorites were the poke nachos and fries Mac&cheese. The fried mac&cheese looked like mozzarella sticks but instead of cheese you bite into gooey mac&cheese. Soooo good, highly recommend! And the tomato dipping sauce that comes with is reminds me of eating a good plate of yummy pasta.   Our feast ended with a couple take out boxes with the last bites of a few dishes. I think we did a good job considering we had 8 plates to four girls :) definitely recommend this place for happy hour for after work drinks, a mid week pick me up or date night!",

    "text": "So I've come to the conclusion that if you're not going for the happy hour the food is not worth the price. Tonight we went for dinner a few minutes after 6. I found it is that there were empty tables but so many people were waiting. That told me one of two things. Either they we're waiting for happy hour to end or they couldn't handle the amount of people.   The wait was ridiculous! It was a long wait getting in it was a long wait before seeing a waitress it was a long wait before seeing anyone again for every single thing even our check that we finally figured out ourselves that we could pay in the automated system.  The service was wonderful though at some point I suppose they were just done with us because they never came back.   THE FOOD Too many of the brussel sprouts of our crispy brussel sprouts and potatoes were so hard my husband had to spit out his bite twice. The sauce for the fried Mac and cheese is one of my favorite things I've had here but this time is was literally unedible. My vampire street tacos were awful! Absolutely tasteless! Calories for nothing upsets me.    $200 meal? Never again.",

My husband ordered the Nashville Hot chicken and it was really good. It comes with some pancakes and spicy honey and they are super tasty. I ordered the BBQ bacon burger well done and I got onion rings instead of fries. My burger was fantastic and the bbq sauce was perfect and tangy. The onion rights were cooked perfectly and they were thin and crispy. I got a side of their spicy bbq sauce to dip them in. I also ordered a Stiegl Radler which is like a grapefruit shandy and it was very good, light and tart. I tried an Ace pineapple cider which was also really good. We can't wait to come abck",

Not only is the ambiance a cool, modern vibe with tons of beer on tap, but they have an extensive menu that is not only affordable, but accommodating.  Each server has an allergy card that guests can read upon request. They cater to gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, but allergies, etc. The servers are very knowledgeable, and if there's something they don't know, they are more than willing to go investigate and find an answer for you.  I ordered the hummus with baked pita bread and a BBQ Gardein chick'n pizza without cheese because Daiya is not really up to par with other vegan cheeses (in my opinion). The server was very helpful with providing me topping ideas.  Overall, the food was pretty good! I noticed they put the french fries in the vegan section on the card, but the server informed me that they are fried in the same oil as meat/fish; therefore, I don't think they should be labeled as vegan. In the future, I would like to see other vegan options without soy, and hopefully another vegan cheese to choose from (cough cough So Delicious or Miyoko's cough cough).",

The menu at yard house is extensive. It truly has something for everyone! Salads, burgers, entrees, Asian style items among many other.  for a quick appetizer we shared the pretzel which they recently added to their menu. It was a special item that they had every once in a while and now they have it full time (said the manager). It came with a spicy mustard and beer cheese sauce. I didn't care for either but when you mixed the two it was surprisingly yummy!   For my lunch I had the fried chicken sandwich. I normally get this at their location in Aventura, Florida but this time was disappointing. The chicken was very small and almost burnt with not much meat. I did eat the sandwich and I was full so i will say it wasn't THAT bad.   The waitress we had was hysterically funny and the manager came over a few times to chat as well. She was quick and we told her we had to catch a flight so she did a great job of getting us in and out. I wish i remembered her name!   Cheers!",

They are like clones as far as food is concerned.  I went to that location first. We had a meetup and that was just a place that was not cheap but not too pricey but they have something for everyone.

Likes: - Onion Ring Tower - Roasted Turkey Melt - Cuban Roast Pork Dip - Five Ounce Blackened Tuna Burger - Mediterranean Seared Scallops - Mini Chocolate Souffle  So-so: - Fried Calamari  Didn't like: - Seared Ahi Steak Sandwich: tuna was not trimmed neatly. Had a hard time eating it because it was tough and gristly. One would expect Ahi Steak to almost melt in your mouth... - (Mac + Cheese)2: didn't smell very appetizing. After I ate it, I kept thinking I was going to get sick. I don't know if it was the wild mushrooms, but definitely not getting that again! - Spicy Jambalaya: It was just ok, but nothing beats a Jambalaya with fresh ingredients  Service is usually good, and it's easy to fit a bunch of us into a booth. Of course we'll be back - we're regulars here and come here when we don't feel like thinking of where we'd like to eat.",

    "text": "Tonight was another date night with my beautiful bride! I decided to come here because the last time we were here the food was great and I wanted to sample some of their amazing beer.   Tonight our server was Beau. He was wonderful and made great recommendations. I think this review moved up to the 5th star level because of his wonderful and attentive service to us.   I liked that we could sample around a little bit before I found \"my\" beer. LOL! I had the Speakeasy Double Daddy IPA. It had a deep hoppy flavor. Seriously they have the biggest selection of draft beer around. I can't believe someone couldn't find a favorite here.  Laurie had the same thing she had last time. The Spicy grilled chicken flat bread sandwich and she asked our waiter Beau to sub the fries for a salad. No problem! I ordered the Mac+Cheese2 and it had pulled chicken breast, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar, parmesan, campanelle pasta and truffle oil. It was as good as it sounds. The campanelle pasta was on point. I loved that it was not overcooked like you might find in some mac and cheeses.  This whole time while we are enjoying our meal we were never in need of anything. After the customary check back to see how our meal was and if everything was as we wanted we never had a want for a soda or water glass to be refilled. Beau also recommended another beer and brought us over samples, while consistently keeping our table cleared of any empty plates.  Desert was in my mind as I had read a previous Yelpers compliments of the Salted Carmel Butterscotch pudding. I ordered it and when it was brought to the table it had a great presentation, but an even better taste. The only thing that could of made it better is if they could of put the salt all the way around the top of it. Laurie had 4 spoonfuls before she ever tasted it, and I had 1 and was coughing because it was all on my side of the cup. It was too much for me, but might have been fine had it been spread around. Don't take this wrong, it was great and I probably would order it again!!  Overall I feel that service can make or break a great restaurant. I think that the Yard House is certainly becoming one of my favorite places to dine. The great food and the service we received tonight has me already planning my return!",

He even brought 2 refills of drinks so he didn't need to check on us again. Unfortunately,  he brought the wrong refill. Hopefully,  others get better attended to than we did.",

After struggling to choose from such a good beer selection and enjoying some good calamari and a smartly deconstructed spicy tuna roll, I am happy to admit my expectations were totally wrong! I also happened to stumble in during happy hour, which sweetened the deal even more. The appetizers were half price and more than served as a meal. The tuna roll was fresh, heaping with avocado and very flavorful with an elegant presentation. The staff was friendly and attentive despite being busy.  I suppose the best review I can give is that I will definitely go back the next time I'm in Vegas (or another city where a Yard House happens to exist)!",

I've tried almost all of their appetizers, and I don't have a single complaint... the entrees I've had have also been stellar. Huge portions to go along with those huge glasses of beer... most of the servers I've come accross usually can suggest which beer should be paired with which dish and vice-versa.

One of my fave parts of this restaurant/bar is the gardein options for all vegans or vegetarians.  Their jerk chicken gardein option is beyond delicious and flavorful.  I must find the recipe to share for Football Sunday with my veggie friends.  The same goes for their Buffalo Wings and Firecracker Wings.  SOOOO good!  I think they're WAY better than actual wings and the flavor is so on point that I will most likely only eat gardein wings moving forward!  I've tried several things on the menu that weren't just vegetarian friendly and haven't been let down since.  I'd name them all, but, who's got the time for all that?  If you're looking for a relaxed joint with a chilled atmosphere, huge selection of food and decent beer, check out Yard House.  It's become my favorite neighborhood bar.  Great service and the wine is always fresh tasting, as well.  (I hate when I get served a glass of red from a bottle that's been open for a few days..)  Great place!",

Okay, okay...maybe not famished but stopping at a place that boasts the most draft beers in the world caught my eye, plus it was connected to the red rock casino, double win!  The draft beer selections lined the center island of the bar all the way around with many of the boring bar regulars but with more craft than anything. The 3 page list of drafts were really impressive and it was nice that they offered 3 different sizes for pours but it was absolutely dreadful that they didn't offer the ability to create our own flights which made them lose a star in my book. The next star was lost because they really didn't have any hard to find specialty brews.... A large selection is nice but ill take a smaller selection any day for better quality.  We decided a small snack was called for so we decided we would split an appetizer between the three of us. The chicken nachos were mouth gobbling good, it was a hearty portion of multicolored chips that stayed crunchy even with the two different types of sauces, guacamole, sour cream, pinto beans, and obey gooey melted cheeses. Yum!! I was impressed with all the flavors and that it wasn't greasy in the least.   I'd go to this chain again, but not without checking what beers are on tap.",

Yeah, I have to deduct a point because during busy sports seasons like NBA Finals or Football playoffs, the servers tend to not be as diligent, and the food portions get a little too small. Plus, the take-out service is lacking. I came one time and did not get my food promptly because the hostesses are more concerned with paying attention to the tables.  But enough of the negative. Good vibe, cool music, not too loud. Come at 3-6 for happy hour. I usually get the Pepper-Crusted Gorgonzola or the Fish and Chips. Appetizers are amazing, but be careful: Calamari is pretty small, but the Chicken Nachos are huge.",

    "text": "This is mainly a review for dirt bag climbers who go to Red Rocks Canyon to get their winter trad rock climbing fix. I could really give a rat's ass about Las Vegas gambling and tourist culture. The rub of making a climbing trip to Las Vegas is, well, Las Vegas: a dearth of decent beer selections, overpriced food, the dreaded strip. I was explaining all of this to a local climbing out at Red Rocks, explaining apologetically that my girlfriend and I were from Portland, and thus we were insufferable beer snobs. This local fellow, a guy named Adam, told us to go to the Yard House, explaining that it had the largest draft selection on earth. I'm not sure if this is True, but they clearly have well over 100 taps, including a full section of their menu devoted to \"piny, citrusy, hoppy IPA\". Hello! Furthermore, it's right outside of Red Rocks on your drive back to Vegas.  At any rate, we stopped by after a day of climbing and discovered that happy hour is from 3 - 6 daily, and that their normally rather overpriced pints ($7+) were a more reasonable $5. Stone Ruination double IPA worked for me. More importantly, select appetizers are half off. I ordered Chicken Nachos for $6, expecting, well, and appetizer sized portion. What I recieved was a MASSIVE platter of nachos. Well more than I could eat by myself. My girldfriend ordered spinach cheese dip and chips, which was equally huge. We returned here daily for a few pints and shared an order of the chicken nachos--which was more than an ample meal for the two of us. Dinner for $3 a head? In Vegas (well okay, Sommerlin really)? Awesome.  Dirt bags, this is your cheap post climb dinner destination. It get's kind of packed for happy hour, but you really can't beat the beer selection and the prices. And while it is at a casino, it's not really 'in' a casino. There is outside access from the parking lot, so you can avoid the sea of chain smoking slot machine slaves.",

The portion size is good enough for a party of 3 at the most. We ended up ordering the chicken nachos which by the way were absolutely delicious and the best part was, that it was good enough for 4 people. Service was decent, they forgot to bring our drinks s couple times but overall service was good and employees were attentive.

    "text": "Alright, so I went here for the first time with a huge group of co workers, and I got here early because they do not take reservations, and every time my co workers have come here for shin-dings they have had to wait a ridiculous amount of time. But this time I was seated quickly and we were served very fast, in and out.  So this review is based mostly on the fact that they have a very good vegetarian menu that even meat eaters love. I am talking about the most amaze-balls buffalo tofu wings I have ever eaten, ever. Some of my co workers even got some for themselves they taste so bloody great. Their veg menu is much more than salads and veggie burgers, they have fish 'n chips, chicken wings, fried wings, and even meatballs.   They also have some very good truffle fries and a California rolls app that is one huge circle of rice, fish, and ginger. And for those who like alcohol they have a huge selection of draft beers and wines. HUGE.  Down sides are that they do not take reservations, lighting is very dim, especially outside, and wait staff can be slow at times. I once had my water filled all over twice after I told them to just bring me a bunch- I am eating buffalo wings for cripes sake! Anyways, other than a few hit and misses this place is a good place to come with a bunch of friends, but it is pretty pricey considering.",

The food is absolutely fantastic The best beer selection in both quality and quantity Amazing happy hour; try the marg pizza or wings Casual and laid back atmosphere Many TVs with all the games on Great for a date, family dinner or just drinks Prices are very reasonable, even for Vegas  Now beyond all this, my girlfriend and I are both servers in the Vegas industry. We have high expectations, especially in this town. We have made a tradition that after every Red Rock hike we go to Yardhouse. I say this because the service stands out with and possibly beyond everything else. Now we usually sit at the bar, and every bartender is cheerful, attentive, patient and more than happy to talk you through food and beer.  This week, I was beyond impressed when Oz not only came over to greet us right away, but remembered the beer he let me sample well over a week before. Hats off to you my friend.",

I don't know if the snack menu is a new concept for the Yard House because I don't remember seeing it before. I liked that idea a lot because we were able to order a couple of different things to taste.   I had the Shrimp Ceviche that were served with four filled spoons. If you are hungry don't order this because it may just piss you off. I wasn't that hungry so it was just right! It had little bits of Mango in it which was a nice twist.   I also ordered their salad that came with Avocado, Mandarin Oranges, Strawberries, and Candied Pecans. It was really good some people don't get the fruit in salad combo but I really enjoy it. It just makes it more satisfying for me.   We also snacked on some good old chips in salsa. You can never go wrong with that.   The multiple snacks kept us alert and satisfied to play for a few hours at Red Rock. It was a winning night all around!",

    "text": "I'd have to say variety accounts for most of the appeal of Yard House..  They have by far the largest draft beer selection of anywhere I've ever seen, available in a variety of glass sizes. Pair that with an overwhelming selection of interesting items and you have a menu full of food and drink that will appeal to everyone.  This makes Yard House an ideal place for large parties and group gatherings. It might not amaze everyone, but all are pleased with the amount of choices available.  I've had some great food at YH locations and some very forgettable meals.  So while the menu is extensive and generally very appealing, not everything is great.  The location at Red Rock is a pretty good one. It's conveniently located and usually not too busy. The restaurant usually appears full but I've never had to wait for a table.   The beer selection is stellar, but tonight, both my pints (grapefruit sculpin and victory IPA) came out lightly chilled. I don't know about you, but I like my beer as cold as it can get before crystallizing. I know restaurants never serve beer that incredibly cold, but a place meant for beer should at least serve their beer cold enough to be called cold. Just a little disappointing to pay $7.50 for a nearly warm pint.  The food was kinda off tonight too. I got blackened swordfish tacos, which were a little salty, but pretty good. I usually have a burger here and I think I'll probably stick to their sandwiches from now on.  My wife tried a BBQ chicken pizza and it just seemed very uninspired. It was served warm, cheese had no flavor, sauce was way too sweet.. She only had a slice.  I recommend their appetizers and beer highly, though. If you can make it during happy hour, this place is great!",

I would like to start with the positive and say that the old 43 is an incredible drink. It is simple, boozy enough, balanced, and delicious. Also the lettuce wraps, while not the best ive had, were satisfying with flavorful sauces and the elaborate wonton bowl aspect.   However, the service we received at the bar left a really bad taste in my mouth. Sorry to use such a hackneyed metaphor, but in this case its stale nature is fitting.   Our bartender josh didnt start off terribly (but made no attempt to be friendly) but when it came time to pat our bill he took our cash and then disappeared. When i pointed this out to another bartender, she tracked him down and he made a big fuss about how busy he was, clearly bothered and blaming it on other guests saying how weeded he was. I am sorry but i work in the industry and this is textbook how NOT to handle being slammed.  You dont say that to a guest!  Anyway after he left to \"go get our change\" i overheard him complaining about us to another employee (!!) making exaggerated annoyed gestures in my direction and blatantly rolling his eyes. Then, when he finally came back, he asked me how much money id given him. How can you take someones money, lose track of how much they gave you, and still have the audacity to make them feel like its their fault?  The icing on the cake here was that when he  finally managed to give us our change  he said \"easy fix bro\", with no apology or eye contact, immediately giving us an annoyed cold shoulder. How insulting!   Overall, decent food that is not worth the trouble of the bad service.",

    "text": "Yard House is a staple in the late-night-casual-hangout category for me. In that aspect, this Yard House did not disappoint! They are located inside the Red Rock Resort, with the usual Yard House setup. Lots of tables, good for group, and a fantastic beer selection. I would absolutely go back for drinks with a group of friends.   The food at this location was a bit below average- it was all okay (pasta, appetizers), but nothing stood out as great. Unfortunately, our waiter was basically unable to answer any questions about the food or the beers. Something I usually enjoy at Yard House is how knowledgable the staff is about the beer.    Pros/Cons for going with a large group:  They split the check by customer (so it was easy to see what you ordered and total up how much each of us owed), although we then waited more than 30 minutes for our cards and cash to be taken.",

    "text": "I've been going to Yardhouse for quite some time, before it even came to Las Vegas. (I've even had an actual yard of beer, which has now been relegated to a display case by the hostess stand.  Should they change their name to Half-Yardhouse? :)) I think I may have emailed Yardhouse in a drunken rage one night in 2004 because they did not have a location here, but they were opening one in Phoenix. But anyway... now we have two!  Some friends wanted to meet up here and I felt a little apprehensive because it is always crazy crowded.  All twelve of us squeezed into one of the long booths, which was a feat and just started ordering.  It worked out surprisingly well thanks to the attentiveness and patience of the staff.  They kept clearing as needed and just made it work with a fun, can-do attitude.  Two things I did not know about Yardhouse: 1) Apparently someone took the time to type in all the ingredients to all the dishes into their Micros (aka ordering machine computer  thing).  So if you have people in your group with allergies (we had two), they can get a printed list of all the ingredients lickity-split.  None of that, \"I asked the cooks and they think it may not have peanuts in it.  Maybe.\" 2) On Monday night, during football season, happy hour is from 3pm until close!  How come no one said anything!?!  Check out <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yardhouse.com%2FNV%2Flas_vegas%2F&s=a841a3772f490d2300ebc0709a21736c8a3c131ef2e65b6efbdef7b56736d075\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">yardhouse.com/NV/las_veg...</a> for all the happy hour options and prices.  Maybe this is to compete with LBS that has a $15 mug one-time purchase with 10 cent refills promotion?  Not sure if the Monday happy hour applies to the Town Square location...  Plus, a bonus for me is that they actually had Goose Island Matilda on tap, which is my favorite beer.  Last couple times I came to visit it was tapped out.    The only thing that sucks a little is that their firecracker wings have gone the way of the yard.  Back in the day they were actually spicy as the name would imply. But apparently, like the yard of beer, they were too spicy from some folks and finally management relented.  Now they are just wimpy and sweet.  Nevertheless, all in all a good night at the Yardhouse! Reminscient of those days of old in Socal.",

Drinks were forgotten about, food came out sporadically, and overall the servers seemed overwhelmed.  Why still the 4 stars?  Because despite everything going wrong, the manager came up and insisted on making things right.  We never complained or said anything was wrong, but instead a very astute manager noticed, and would not take no for an answer when asking if there was anything she could do.    The exact kind of service that will make us come back time and time again!",

Some things on the menu are amazing.... And some are \"meh.\" The service is usually good but Casey, my bartender today, was the best. He remembered my name throughout my entire meal even though it seemed really busy. That was really nice because a lot of times when dine by yourself you get forgotten about. He checked on me several times and did everything in a timely manner. Seriously great service.",

The staff is pretty nice and I have never had too many problems the times that I have gone. When I go, I usually stick to the steaks on the menu. You can't go wrong with those options. I have tried some salads and pastas. Those are always ok. I've had almost every appetizer and my favorite is the coconut shrimp. My biggest gripe about this place is that the menu is giant. My feelings are whenever a menu is that big, that can't possibly being doing everything well, or as good as they could be. If they cut down the menu size and focused on fewer things, I think there would be a better product overall.",

When a few things didn't come out right he made sure to correct the mistake quickly and apologized.  Overall everything tasted great and the service was good. I like coming to these kind of joints, because you can hang out with friends, drink a couple of beers and kick back for as long as you want.

The calamari came out looking like either they were re-using oil or they had left it in the oil too long.   You don't fry calamari like fries where if they're a little too golden, it's okay.  Strangely enough, I tried their famous Mac & Cheese squared.... and it was great, except... it was a little over done too.  Strange.  Now I might update my review of them later since their service although good, was a bit inattentive at times, and it was crowded beyond belief.  Probably due to the Luke Bryan concert going on at the Red Rock that night.  Yeah yeah, I know.  I was like... Luke who? (some country singer for those that don't know).  Hey... what can I say, I'm not a huge fan of country.  So the drop in stars really comes from the food side and a little bit on the service end since the beer selection was great and that actually came out in a timely fashion.  Here's to hoping that next time, the food is done right.",

I have been too the one in Town Square Mall. Really not much difference between them just the location and fan of both. The menu is HUGE sometimes can be good thing or bad thing. I stopped here for lunch after nice long bike ride up too Red Rock Loop with friends. Something caught me eye on the menu. I never notice before was they have small lunch special section half sandwich and soup. It straight forward but lot of things that enjoy about it. They have four too five sandwiches and soups too choose from mix and match. The portion size the sandwich is decent size combine with a nice cup of soup for under $10 think steal of deal. I got the pastrami sandwich with clam chowder soup. Both were excellent! The pastrami nice hot, moist, fan of the bread, and like the spread in it. The clam chowder was solid have decent amount of clams, potatoes, and even cup of soup felt hearty and filling. If you want can even up size your cup too bowl of soup at cost. It perfect meal after getting great workout in light, hearty, and healthy lunch.   The service was fantastic. We went as soon as they opened at 11am. Still our waitress was great, friendly, and informative she was the one that told us about upgrade our cup too bowl is want for extra charge. If looking place for light lunch or heavy lunch Yard House has it and that not even going into the beer list.",

But I'll not let that deter what is always a great time at this chain restaurant/bar with fine service.  I've been to several locations of this joint - Pasadena, Irvine, 2 locations in Vegas - and they are very consistent in what they have to offer.  I was in Vegas over the weekend to catch up with my friends and see if my brother is keeping the house in shape, and the gang of us decided to gather here for lunch.  I honestly cannot remember everything we ordered here, but off the top of my head: lobster crab artichoke dip, seared ahi, california roll, and sweet korean bbq beef for apps, and fish & chips, thai chicken noodle salad, grilled pastrami, and a couple of burgers for entrees.  I tasted all the apps and my fish & chips.  Ahi - good, a bit bland Artichoke dip - good, a bit bland California rolls - interesting shape like pie pieces, but tasted pretty standard Korean bbq beef - meh, my main complaint about the Asian fusion thing Fish & Chips - great fish, great chips Pastrami looked really good, as did the burgers.  As I said great service up-and-down, sufficiently noisy for lunch for vibrance, and the absolute best thing - Boddington's on tap!!!!  Table-for-1 Factor:  It's big enough and bar is absolutely huge with lots of TVs, so I think it should be fine.  Maybe except on weekends...",

It was pretty crowded for a Tuesday night, so it was loud.  Very loud.  I'm not a big fan of loud restaurants, and this was no different from the Yard House in Town Square.  It didn't help that there was a huge table of guys right next to us; it was better after they left, but just a tad.  I had the Blue Crab Cake Hoagie, which came with bacon, avocado, swiss and tomato, with a cajun aioli.  I remembered to ask the waitress if the crab cake was mostly filler, but forgot to ask if it was fried.  So of course, it was.  Deep fried crab cakes - just the thing to stick between two big hunks of break.  I have to admit I liked the crab cakes a lot - I just don't like to eat fried food.  But the bread, which I expected to be crisp 'cause it was toasted, was woefully soft.  My husband had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken Entree, which came with garlic mashed.  He liked it just fine.  Service was good, but overall, I'm not quite sure why this place is so popular.  It must have something to do with me not being a beer drinker!",

I had the blue crab cakes, which I like my crab cakes pan-seared, but these were fried.  The three sauces they served with them were all disgusting.  Would not order these again.  I had the Angel Hair pasta with shrimp and vodka sauce.  It was ok.  The shrimp were perfect and the angel hair was good.  The sauce had WAY TOO MANY shallots and spices in it.  Shallots should be used in small doses.  My Dad had the sliders, which looked good and he enjoyed, but said they weren't really anything special.

The food is over priced and the quality is just not good enough to reflect the price.  I have had probably 20 different items on the menu and have never had that \"this is awesome\" experience, except with the vegetarian menu.  The good:  The beer selection is amazing.  I love craft/draft brew and they have it all.  Also if you are a vegetarian/vegan, the selection and quality of that food is excellent.

    "text": "They have skinny margaritas now!!! Hurray!!   While I believe Yard House has lost it's allure over the past year and is probably only 3* worthy, I'm bumping it up thanks to their low cal drink menu. This Fresh & Skinny menu is fabulous and features several drinks in addition to the skinny margarita, including a lemon drop, a cosmo and a few others. I can tell you the skinny margarita tasted super sweet and the only difference is the missing salt rimmer - which unfortunately just happends to be my favorite part :-(  These drinks are between 115-175 calories. Not bad!  The food is average - since I'm a salad kind of girl I can't help but to leave a little disappointed. I'd much rather dine elsewhere, but their happy hour menu is extensive and with all the drink options, it's pretty easy to find a drink and appy for everyone.  We used to do happy hour here all the time, now we find ourselves here only once a month, if that.",

They were all very tasty and the service was pretty fast. There's a huge beer list several seasonal beers and even a sampler option.

    "text": "I went here while visiting family in the area on a recommendation.  I was super thrilled with the service and tap list.  The Poke nachos were awesome and the truffle fries were pretty delicious too.  They handled my young niece like a pro with all of the whimsical demands of a smaller child.  I actually wound up skipping the beer list since I was still working off a hangover, but went for the lobster mac 'n cheese since I'd heard it was good and my vitality was picking up after the appetizers.  After eating about 1/5 of the mac 'n cheese I decided to take the rest home since my stomach didn't seem up to the task (from the hangover, I thought).  My stomach churned a bit the rest of the day, and I felt a little sick until the next morning.  I figured I'd finally hydrated enough and I felt great all day until I went to the fridge for a late dinner... I ate half of the remaining mac 'n cheese and felt not great within 30-40 minutes.  My stomach churned again the next day...  I know it's tough to pin down a bad meal and I didn't get serious food poisoning or anything, but it is tough to say the mac wasn't to blame.  All of my other meals for the weekend were shared and no one else had any issues.  It stinks because the mac 'n cheese looked really good with big chunks of lobster and I've really enjoyed the Yard House in other cities before, but feeling ill can be tough to overcome.  I know I'll be back for a beer next time I'm in town, but it might take some convincing to add lunch to the schedule.",

    "text": "The Yard House in Irvine is just like the Yard House everywhere. Clean, loud and full of ice cold beer on tap.   I will get the obvious out of the way first, this is a chain in most suburban western region markets and thanks to the hard floors and being inside of a casino it is very, very loud at night, especially on the weekends. It is also worth mentioning these guys bust Classic Rock all day, everyday.   The menu features standard American fare that offers little in surprise but what they do offer is better than it has any right to be, particularly their burgers. My personal favorite is the Pepperjack Burger that features roasted green chiles, pepper jack cheese and garlic aioli on a grilled bun. The Black Truffle Cheese Burger (boasting house made truffle cheese, no less) and Bearnaise Burgers are also admirable, especially a few beers into the night. All burgers are accompanied with a decent helping of Fries and Yard House seems to get the cooked temperature right every time. Another stand out item is their French Onion Soup boasting a perfectly melted cheese and robust onion broth.   These guys also have an exemplar Happy Hour Menu offering an Ahi Poke Bowl, Ceviche and Truffle Fries that I can vouch for at very reasonable prices. The service has always been up to snuff both at a table or bellied up to their gigantic bar.   Which brings us to their best asset; the nearly 200 beers constantly on tap. If you are an adventurous beer drinker, it is pretty damn tough to beat this selection. Every imaginable craft brewery from Coast to Coast and across the ponds seem to be offered. Naturally, this makes the Yard House a great place to catch a sporting event.  If nothing else the beer selection alone will guarantee my return next time I am in Sin City.",

They offer a great happy hour from 3pm to 6pm offering half off drinks and selected, full sized appetizers.  The food is always fresh and the service is always great. A few months ago my boyfriend and I were having a bad day and the server brought us out a complimentary dessert. I thought that was super sweet and it brightened our moods for the moment. Small gestures  like these remind me how nice people can be, and not just for an extra tip! Friday and Saturday nights get busy so expect a wait. I like to come during lunch hour personally. Parking is a little difficult. There is a parking lot but it is shared with Red Rock Casino, the movie theater and the surrounding restaurants.",

    "text": "Since this is a chain...I wanted to visit here a few times before I wrote a review...  Overall, they are a solid 3 stars.   Ambiance is a little crazy and very very loud. If you go at an off time... It's not too bad but if you go at a busy time at around 7 or 8 on a Friday night... It's going to be crowded and super loud with lots of yelling as people are watching sports on the television at the bar... Which happens to be right in the middle of the restaurant. So if you are trying to talk to the person next to you.... Uuhhhhh good luck. :/  (2.5/5)  Price... If you outside of happy hour... The prices are decent for what you get. It's not cheap but it's also not going to break the bank either... So for a night out with friends it's not too bad... And the beers they have on tap and by bottle amazing! They carry beers that I have not seen at other restaurants here in Vegas so it's a plus. :) Also, if you do go for happy hour... Be prepared to be amazed... Most of the items they have at a discounted price for HH are full sized items at the discounted price. Crazy!! It's a great deal. (4/5)... For HH...5/5...:)  Now onto the food...  Cheese curds...Omg.... They are freaking amazing!!! I love me some cheese curds... They are lightly battered and served with 2 sauces... Go for the horseradish sauce... The other one is just too sweet. If you love cheese... These are delish!! 5/5  Burgers... I've had a few different kinds and so has my bf... The fries are da <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>... They are on the thinner side so they are very crispy... They almost seem to have a light batter on them... The burgers were good... Don't get me wrong I did not have any complaints except for the last time...My bf ordered med well... And the burger came out med rare... Maybe a miscommunication? Other then that the burgers are decent. 3.5/5 fries...5/5...:)  Sliders... Decent but nothing too memorable....2.5/5  Tomato bisque... Really too sweet. It had a great texture.... Very creamy.... But they added too much sugar to it...1/5  Grilled cheese sandwich... Surprisingly... Yummy! They put a good amount of crunch on the bread.... And the cheese was good... But the surprise were the roasted tomatoes on the sandwich! Very very good! 4.5/5  Service was a total hit or miss...a couple of the times I went... Service was top notch. Where the water didn't get a chance to empty and the server was touching my table and checking on us without being intrusive... And other times the service was a total miss. Like this last time I went my server's name was Dallas... And I asked her to wipe the table since I got sat at a table that was still filthy from the last table.    :( Not a great start for me. But she acted like she was totally annoyed that I asked her to wipe the dirty table and it took her a while to come and wipe the table. From there on didn't get any better. She filled my drink 2x and I guess that was limit since she came by to clear but never refilled my drink or asked if I wanted a refill. The entire night, she made me feel like I was just a bother... And when I asked for to go box for my sandwich and soup... She brought me a box for my sandwich and nothing for my soup and no bag either. Once again, I had to ask her for a bag and a container for my soup... And once again she was annoyed... But by this time I was done with her. Crappy service. 2/5  Will I be back? Most likely since I love the cheese curds and the beer but if we get her again in definitely asking to be reseated.",

So going to Yardhouse to finish your bday is always a good option, right? WRONG! Worst Service ive ever experienced in a Yardhouse from long beach to HERE! I can't believe how rushed you can rush someone and be so impatient at the same time especially when your at work? Was i bugging her? Were we not the ideal looking couple? Idk what it was but when I ask for a Georgia peach or a summer salad stuff off the menu you know I know yardhouse! She carded me and i say its bday she says yea i see that... No happy bday no glad you came out no attention to detail! Drink had a floater in it had to flag down a manager (blond) waitress was really never to be found! Food runner ran my food I asked for a split salad...he said i can bring you another plate, so you want me to spoon out half my salad on to a plate on a dinner date? And then proceed to bring me a dirty plate? Waited and waited probably at least 5 minutes to the point that we just shared the salad because he brought us a dirty bowl! Steaks were amazing I love the peppercorn filet! House blond always a go to! Freak show and a sweet tart! All great!  Dessert was a cheesecake! Nothing special one as expecting a creme brule cheesecake! They clearly forgot to roast the top! And no bday plate! Like whoa what? And i told the food runner he said you really want the other plate as if it was a huge request...its ONLY my actual bday and then to be charged for my bday dessert! This is not yardhouse standards or dardens for that fact! Yard house was disappointing to say the least! My dining experience was ruined by a girl who didnt even bother washing her apron or had the  time for a proper pony tail! She was rude and impatient and for me to even complain...it was BAD! Genevieve was my server but she was absent and when she was present it was clear she didnt want to be! Hope she has better shifts to come because i would hate for anyone else to experience anything that i did last night!! ESPECIALLY on someone's bday!",

I guess no one asks for them anymore or he just started? I swear, the town square location comes in clutch with the bread since they're busy most times I dine there. It's whatever though, he ended up giving us some anyway. The host/hostess were really welcoming and friendly. The place is always well-kept and clean, I guess I prefer this location for times I'm super hungry and since it's closer to school.

The host was great she sat us down rather quickly, she also got us started on some waters and told us our waiters name while we looked over the menu.   I waited was a little slow at first (I think they were just to busy) and didn't stop by very much to check on us, in fact the manager had to come by and get our drink and appetizer order. Manager was super assume and friendly.    Once out waiter stoped by to take our order the food was cooked perfectly and out quite fast. I would definitely be going back to this location. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice chill spot in a good location with shopping and gambling near by that is not on the strip. Away from the tourist.",

Luckily, we live close and can go in for happy hour which makes it affordable for us college students. We have learned though, that their afternoon deals are usually even better than their happy hour and if you go around 3, you can have the best of both worlds by choosing from either menu.",

    "text": "Yard house is like the new Cheesecake Factory to me...large portions of slightly altered yummy food with great drink choices...slightly more expensive than necessary, but worth it all.  I have always loved the idea of this place...as I am a huge fan of choices...and even though I am not a beer drinker, I am easy to satisfy with beer here.  We visited the Red Rock version Saturday and had a great time.  There was a 30 minute wait for a table for 6, but we were there for probably 2 hours and not rushed off at all once sat.    I drank the super yummy Lindeman's Framboise Lambic, a Pear cider and their Michelob Ultra...all of which were fresh and perfectly cold.  I tasted/shared:  Lobster, Crab, Artichoke Dip...in which luckily no one noticed I did not let get out of my reach...yummmmmm!  Their spinach dip was also good, but again, I was focused on the other dip.  Basic blue cheese wedge salad...I have had better, but it did the job of getting a vegetable in my system...  Lobster garlic noodles...tasty, especially the spinach and mushrooms, but prefer udon noodles (this was wheat spaghetti)  (Mac + Cheese)2 which was highly recommended...I could taste all the   ingredients including the truffle oil, mushrooms and huge chunks of bacon.  This is surely a meal for the girl attempting to earn some curves, if you know what I mean...so I didn't enjoy all of it, not even half, but the con-dieter in me says YIPPEE for finding this delicious version of a fan fav.    Prices are not necessarily a deal...but nothing sucked enough to be upset about it.  I am glad there is one close to my house now and will be back soon.",

Their \"gardein menu\" items are all cooked on the same flat top and in the same oil as all the meat, as the waitress informed us. The hostess also seated us at a table near the bar, next to a 12 top of extremely drunk and loud women. I asked her to reseat us at a booth and she flat out said no. We asked for the check after the drinks as our friends were disgusted at the thought of consuming meat juices. The waitress practically threw the check at us and stormed off. Luckily when I complained on twitter about the whole incident, a woman from the yardhouse corporate office did her best to rectify the bad experience. We may be back with non-veg friends...",

Love them! The desserts are huge enough to share with more than one person.  Clam Chowder is greattt! Salads are amazing.  I can't think of everything I've eaten here, but I know that its always been great.  I think I could try everything on the menu and like it.  Ohh I had a raspberry beer once, that was good!

And yet there were four parties of two - four people waiting more than fifteen minutes. It's a holiday, and the place is less crowded than I've ever seen it, and yet they have people waiting? Hostesses wiping down menus instead of actually hosting. I go here at least once a month when I go to a movie, and I've never seen such crappy service. They have great guac, but besides that there's nothing unique abt this place. I'll find a new spot for movie lunching from now on thanks to their horrendous customer service today.",

The location is a short drive from my house  Enter Yard House 2.....  1. Same Great Happy Hour 2. Food and beer both tasted the same 3.

    "text": "My first experience at Yard House was a fantastic one. I do not recall having better customer service at any other restaurant. From the hostess to the waiter to the bus boy ---- Wow! They made me feel so special.  I entered via the entrance within the casino and was directed to the front of the restaurant for seating arrangements. I hope in the future that they are able to seat customers at both entrances.  They asked if I preferred indoor or outdoor seating. I was in a movie for the two hours prior, so I chose indoor seating just in case the weather was acting up (again).  Our waiter was fantastic. We ordered what he recommended, which was the jambalaya and the mac and cheese. Their fried calamari was okay; I still think Olive Garden's is a lot better. Don't forget to ask for extra marinara sauce.  The jambalaya was tasty with two large shrimp atop a bed of linguine (or jasmine rice, if you prefer). It was tasty and I'm not usually fond of spicy food.  The mac and cheese was good. I think I have had better elsewhere, but it's a personal preference of mine to have super creamy mac and cheese, not dry as if it were baked, which I think it was. It was supposed to have bacon in it, but I did not find any. The chicken and mushrooms were a great additions.   My boyfriend raved about his jambalaya, but the mac and cheese was only okay. I'll be back to try more of their entrees.  Overall, the customer service is what made this experience so good for me. I don't know if it's due to them just opening, but I hope it stays that way.",

    "text": "Finally after months of trying we were able to get in and get seated without being told there is a 1 hour wait.  Oh the excitement.   Not so exciting is the placement of the doors.  If you are entering from the casino, the host person still has you schlep across the entire restaurant to the other host person.  We have technology people..use it.    So we get seated and surprisingly it was pretty empty for a Saturday afternoon. In fact there were only 2 tables occupied in our section so imagine our surprise when it took more than 15 minutes just to have someone come take our drink order.    We ordered appetizers and then our lunch.  We got the Korean BBQ beef & the firecracker wings.  I have to say the Korean BBQ was delicious with the jasmine rice as an accompaniment.    The firecracker wings? not so much.  In fact we sent them back. They were not even close to spicy as the description said but rather just covered in a gooey tasteless sauce.  I should have gone with my gut and ordered the jerk wings instead.    For our lunch, we had the Mac + cheese 2, which was ok considering the huge chunks of bacon that came with it.  I think it might have been better without the truffle oil since the combo of mushrooms & bacon overwhelm the flavor already but geeze it's only mac & cheese x2.    I had the tomato bisque and grilled cheese.  The bisque was quite good as was the grilled cheese. Not quite as good as Serendipity 3 but certainly closer and easier to get to without schleping to the strip.    The thing that took this down a * to a 2* was the service. I can understand if they are jamming on an NFL Sunday or the World Cup etc but it was pretty much an echo chamber on our side of the room, yet service was so very slow. Except in getting our food on the table because about 5 minutes after our appetizers showed up, there was our meal.  Which in retrospect of the bad wings, was ok, but I would have liked to have finished the shared Korean BBQ first.   Then after we were done, we sat there for another 10-15 minutes waiting for our waitress (and asking the bus person 2x) to bring our check.    This is like the 3rd place in a row that we've been that the food was not bad but the service was so non-existent.  I know the excuse 3 years ago was because there were so many people pouring into Vegas that restaurants didn't care whether you got good service or not, you were \"lucky\" to get a table but you'd think with so many places closing their doors, the ones who are actually doing a good job would want to encourage passable customer service.    ah well ..IF we can get in, we'll def. go back.  I want to go when I'm not driving so I can try some of their handcrafted libations.",

I called them a week in advance to tell them about the situation and called back the day before to make sure it will be all taken care of. Their manager Tex was so helpful and accommodated my large party for me. He reassured to me over the phone that they will try their best to make everything work out. Once I got there, I met Tex and found out that the tables were all set and ready to go :) The waiters were very good and checked back with us constantly. They refilled our drinks regularly, checked if our food was good, and made sure my guests and i were doing well. My friend's salad accidentally had an ingredient she requested not to have, but they took care of that, apologized, and ended her experience with a happy note. Again, thank you so much to Tex and the staff for making it memorable for me and making my guests feel happy :)",

During happy hour when it isn't super busy. We came here after a disastrous attempt at Hachi and ugh, we were let down. It's not their fault they are busy on Saturday night and have a 20 minute wait. I get that. What I don't get is the 5 tables we saw open while people were waiting. That gets annoying from a customer POV. Anyway, we get seated and place our order. I got the grilled cheese with tomato  bisque. I've had the bisque before and it is devine. Absolutely fantastic. The others in my party ordered sandwiches as well. I guess they made mine first and then put under the heat lamp because when it came out it was cold. Seriously. COLD. And the cheese wasn't melted. What good is a heat lamp????, since it's a pretty costly sandwich my brother asked for them to bring me a new one. So, I wait. And I wait. And wait some more. Finally,it comes out. Not grilled AT ALL and cheese still cold!!!!!! WTF? Waiter says he will bring me another one, I ask for original one back lol. It was grilled, as sandwich implies, but cold. He offers something else. At this point  we just want to go. they buy us dessert which was very nice and didnt charge me for the sandwich but I left extremely disappointed. I love this place.  I've always had fantastic service and great food. Tip: don't come Saturday night. I learned my lesson.",

We found 4 seats at the bar and ordered food and drinks.  The pomegranate martinis were excellent and my ahi salad was delicious.  The service was quick and friendly, but the only slight \"quirk\" was the fact that they made us run a tab and closed it out after each round.  And they made us pay for our food as soon as we ordered, like before it even came to the table.  I think my friend and her husband ended up doing 3 separate transactions, one round of drinks of her credit card, cash for their food and another round charged to their room.    It's a busy, busy place and there was a bit of a wait for a table, which is why we chose the bar, but I would definitely go back.",

When I go there, my friends and I usually order several different items off the appetizer menu, as they are large portions and it's great to share.

Busy schedule, always with clients and I can comfortably take any of my clients here. From the t-shirt tech guy to the established elitist.... there is something there for them.  I've been everywhere in Summerlin and for price, service, an extensive menu and overall consistency -- Yard House is the best place to go without having to break the bank.  The food is always good.... the service is always great. From Business Lunches to Late Night Debauchery -- we always have a good time.  The only thing I can think of complaining about after 20+ visits is that sometimes it gets really, really busy and the wait for a table or to even find a couple of places at the bar can be long.... but that's certainly not Yard House's fault. (Open up another one in Summerlin!)  An obvious sign of success that some certain other places in the area should take notice of to step up their standards of providing quality food, great service and a great atmosphere for a great price.  - Cheers!",

The service tends to be good too but you can always get the slow server as with every restaurant. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the prices. The food prices are reasonable but the beers are spendy. I understand it is probably because of the ridiculous rent they must pay to be in the Red Rock Casino but it is still a bit annoying when you go there regularly. Anyway, definitely check it out if you have never been...",

    "text": "For anyone who knows or was part of a large group by the bar today, Sunday July 18th that showed up around midnight- part of your party needs to learn some manners. Yeah, you're at a place that is a dining establishment as well in case you didn't notice it isn't a club where standing room is expected.   There is a long bar with empty seats so there is no need to have a circle like we're at fucking camp bunched around 3 people already sitting at the bar. I am calling out particularly a guy with a  white longsleeved shirt depicting a archangel religious scene holding up a British flag- thank you for invading my boyfriends dining space and making him feel really intruded upon. I glared and made eye contact with you and the girl even to know that you aren't appreciated and it goes unnoticed. One of your party (thank you greyish? shirt guy) pointed  to our table and pointed out that you and your girlfriend in a purple-ish, blue-ish tank were in our space- you didn't listen to your friend proves you guys were class A people, A- hole class that is. A few of your friends did it too, but then when they actually touched the back of my boyfriends chair appologized and moved out (mohawk guy with a white shirt and tie thanks). If it wasn't for my levelheaded boyfriend I would have gone to the middle of the group and told them off to notice that they aren't the only ones here.   The waitress was okay. I think as a persons dining host, the comfort of your guests is of importance. I learned from hospitality that seeing the party hover so close our table that it's courteous to ask if we are okay sitting there or to ask the people if they would like a table or a place set up for them at the bar to keep them away from diners. We ended up reseating ourselves when it took a while for her to come back for us, far the fuck away from the bar in a different section. We took our drinks and plates of food to a booth with the help of a different waitress. After we move, guess what happens? They spread out a bit more properly to a table and part of the bar...of course it happens only after they irritate people.   A beer wouldn't make up for it, but it helps my mood. They did not have Goose Island Matilda on tap today which I wanted and I settled for a random pick I haven't seen around Vegas- Petrus Blond which was not balanced with it's malts and underwhelming. Fuck, couldn't even get a decent blind pick beer today.  Our food was good (garlic noodles, turkey sliders, crab cake) , but not good enough to level my mood. 3 is being VERY nice and only because I love YardHouse.",

When you point out that you haven't even had a sip yet, and they are demanding payment in full , they say its their policy. At any other (non corporate) bar, this would be the height of insulting unfriendliness. In addition, most cards have high limits (I think mine is 20k) . So if I were a thief, they would be on the hook for a few beers, but if anyone in their bar is dishonest, I'm on the hook for 20k! Whom is working for whom here?

    "text": "This was a pretty convenient place to stop and get a bite in the middle of a gambling night at Red Rock Resort. It is very loud inside so I highly recommend getting a table on the patio if you want to have a decent conversation with your dinner guests.   The menu is huge so there is definitely something for everybody. The beer selection is enormous, wine selection better than decent and of course a full bar to round out your libations.  I had the very tasty organic tomato bisque on my recent visit along with a New York Steak Salad. The salad was more than filling and the steak was cooked to order. The wait staff was friendly and service quick. Just what you need when you're itching to get back to the tables!  Enjoy!",

Nothing special about either.    There was a decent size crowd for lunch.  If you are trying to have a conversation with someone, you can forget about it.  Between the music blaring and the noise of the crowd, it was hard for me to hear what my friend was saying.  Decent food, but nothing special.",

My beau and I ordered:  - spinach crab dip  - firecracker wings - surf n turf burger - Bahn mi pork belly sandwich *watermelon wheat beer *bacon Bloody Mary w/ beer shooter   Spinach crab dip comes out nice and hot, nice balance of spinach and crab not too fishy like some are. Comes with warm pita bread and chips. I order this every time I visit!!! First time for the firecracker wings.. Yummy!!! Sweet and a little bit of spicy, but not too much, and had a nice cilantro flavor as well. Crunchy and not soggy. You haveto try these!!! Beau had his favorite surf n turf burger, medium done, topped with lobster and a side of shoestring fries and bearnaise sauce. Burger is delicious! Shoestring fries annoy me because they're too skinny, but they were perfectly seasoned and crunchy. Not a big fan of bearnaise, but went well with the burger.  Pork belly Bahn mi was so tasty!!! It came with a side of naked coleslaw with lime (forgettable) but the pork belly was nicely charred and flavorful and a bit sweet. The Vietnamese sandwich came together with a nice radish, carrot- slaw with cucumber and mint on top a ham spread (really good!) and a light citrus sauce. DELICIOUS!!  My watermelon wheat beer was nice and smooth, not sweet nor bitter, but perfect and the bacon Bloody Mary tasted like bacon and since we like it spicy, was extra savory! Not sure what to do with the beer shooter.. We just added it in!   My visit to yard house red rock location is always superb, service is friendly and prompt, and am always left satisfied. Thank you Ariandia for you service!!! 5 star all day long!!!!",

    "text": "Dining at Yard House Lunch vs. Dinner. Which do you prefer?   I've had two dining experiences at this restaurant and they are completely different from another. One enjoyable and one not so much. So I asked myself why. Was it the atmosphere, or maybe the time frame?   My first time dining at the Yard House was 3 years ago around 7, maybe 8pm. Let's just say cocktail hour. Haha. I couldn't stop drooling over the huge selection of craft beers. Again this was 3 years ago. Other restaurants didn't have such a variety at the time which made their beer list quite impressive. I tasted ever beer at least once and some a few times. :-)     I ordered the crab and artichoke dip as an appetizer and fruity cocktails for my main dish. I was on a date so I appreciated the dim lighting. I think the candles were even scented. Or Maybe I was just buzzed. Either way I enjoyed my evening.  My second time was yesterday about 2pm. In my opinion this restaurant was to loud and lacked intimacy. I was disappointed. Due to slow service I only had time for 3 cocktails. It's a brewery for goodness sake. I felt like I was in a school cafeteria. I didn't know whether to eat my food or start a food fight. I was terrified. Kids were running around everywhere. I was waiting for the servers to get trampled.   I will never step foot in The Yard House before 8pm.",

I had fish, I cannot remember the name but it was mighty tasty. I also had a few Paulaners as well. The kids menu has a good selection for the little ones.

The edamame was spicy and garlicky and buttery...yum! For our entrees, it's surf and turf burger, chicken garlic noodles, a Korean short taco and Korean pork belly taco. The garlic noodles was extremely good. I was not too sold on the surf and turf burger even with the lobster meat but hubby loved it. The pork belly taco was good, a little fatty for me but what do you expect from a pork belly? It was perfect with the kimchi. Didn't get to try the Korean short rib taco because we were too full. Brought home the taco and most of the garlic noodles for later.  There's only one negative thing I could think of. It's that they are on the other side of town :(",

I was going to take my son to the movies inside Red Rock Casino, and had placed a to-go order from Yard House so we could grab our food and make it over to the movies at the other side of the casino. We were out running errands when I placed my order over the phone, and by the time we arrived I realized we had plenty of time to sit down and eat. This apparently was WAY too complicated a request for A) the girl at the first counter B) the lady server who was going to grab our order and B) another chick who brought us waters. I walked in and said, \"Hey, I placed a to-go order but we actually have more time now, I was hoping we could be seated.\" All I got was weird confused looks in response like no one could understand what I was saying. So I said again, \"We just have more time than I thought we would, can we have our to-go order at a table?\" The counter girl looked as though I had kissed her boyfriend. I'm not sure what all the confusion and disgust was about, but I couldn't get an actual answer until after other customers had already walked up and picked up their to-go order, so I asked again and then was told, \"YEAH we're getting you a table.\" Um.... okay. Thanks?  Then they had a fit over whether or not we needed our food plated. No, I said, that's okay, we're still going to head over to the movies and want the to-go boxes. Then there was a bunch of confusion about our drinks. A woman dropped off glasses of water, to which I said (softly, as I was already afraid of getting a pissed off response), \"We had actually ordered sodas with our food.\" And she just shook her head and said, \"I don't know anything about that.\" And walked away. So then the other woman who had seated us passed by, and I asked about the sodas (because our food had already been brought over, but not the drinks, so I was wondering if they'd been forgotten) to which she replied, \"Yes, I know you had drinks. We are bringing them.\" It was a good 5-10 minutes between getting the food and getting the sodas so I don't think it was weird of me to ask about them.  My grilled cheese and tomato soup was phenomenal. Just wish I could say the same about the restaurant staff. For the record, this is maybe the first (possibly second) YELP review I've ever written, because I don't usually bother. But this experience was enough to make me never go back. Oh! And while we were there, I jumped onto a group text with my 5 best friends and told them what a shit show it was, 2 of them wrote back to say they had similar experiences at this location. Great establishment, tastey food, good beer and not too shabby prices........... SHITTY staff.",

This yard house has been one of the great successes at Red Rock casino, with a lot of places opening and closing within the casino this business should be around for a while.  The yard house has more beers than you can drink in 10 sittings from all over the states and the world. If the Cheesecake Factory is the queen of cheesecake well Yard house is the king of beers. (Sorry Budweiser)  The service is quite fast but with  weekends and nights a reservation is a must.  Food wise, the menu is extensive with great apps and a nicely portion sized entrees. I've never got to the deserts as I'm always full half way through my main.  Shepard's pie was the last meal I had which was a saint Patricks day special. It was a little overboard with the amount of sauce and the pastry was most of the plate which became a little much while eating.

Got our drinks and ordered appetizer. Ordered another beer and after 10 minutes waiter said bar was slow and beer was coming. Ordered dinner and nothing. After 20 minutes waiter came over and said kitchen lost our order what was it we ordered again. It was obvious the waiter was no good at this point 20 minutes later dinner came and by that time tables next to us had turned. We were no longer hungry and took food home with us.   Of course when bill came there was no adjustment for late meals or even just a comped drink that we waited on. We are locals and this location caters to locals but we were really disappointed.   Not sure if we will ever go back, they did not seem to care about us so why bother. Very disappointing.",

Ratings: (out of five)  Food (3): We ordered two different taco and a shiitake garlic noodles.  The tacos were good, but not worth the $2 something price tag that comes along with it. The garlic noodles were okay, sometimes I just feel like I am eating noodles with lots of garlic powder on it.   Service (4): Our server was friendly and she kept checking up on us.  It was a very busy night and I believe there was a party of over sixty people that they had. But she was always there and constantly making sure everything was good.  Atmosphere (3.5): Just down to earth and very laid-back.    Overall (3):  I never been impressed with yardhouse, but I do like their selection of different beers that they have and they do have a variety of food selection.  However, each time I ordered something different, it never taste any good.  If anyone can recommend me something that they love at yardhouse, I would love to try it! :)",

Said Mike, \"Yeah, I keep giving them a chance hoping things will change.\"  Chuck, the first waiter, was terrific.  Great personality and just a fun guy.  When we got switched to Molly, however, mmm, not so much.  Not her fault really, but she's no Chuck.     Rick's margarita was terrible and they wouldn't re-make it.  Worst was that they had an attitude about the fact it was a crappy drink. Three of us verified that it sucked.   The pizza appetizer was just ok, at best, and the Chinese something-or-other was bad as well.  As for the entrees, I had the pan seared scallops.  They were undercooked and the mosh stuff in the middle (oro pasta plus god-knows-what) wasn't very appealing either.    I absolutely would not recommend this place to any friends and if Eck insists on going back there again, I'll stage a mini-coup and vote him down.",

We started with the hot and spicy edamame and fried Brussels sprout and potatoes appetizers along with our drinks. The edamame was so well received that we ordered a second. Since appetizers were going so well we decided to make a dinner out of them and ordered: grilled Korean BBQ beef, Buffalo wings, Wisconsin fried cheese curds (one friend is from the mid-west) and coconut shrimp. All the dishes were well prepared and flavorful with the Korean BBQ beef being the top choice. Served with a choice of brown or Jasmine rice, spinach, daikon radish and green onion it was outstanding and would easily be an entree dinner next time we go. Our server, Dallas, was friendly, attentive and all around great. All in all it was a wonderful first experience and it won't be long before we return.",

Tonight from the time we finally sat down to the time our food arrived, over an hour had passed, partly because the waiter took ridiculously long to take our order. Granted we had a larger group than usual but this was still a long wait even for a group.  The waitress was good about filling our drinks but we just wanted food. Unfortunately the food was mediocre and hardly warm when it arrived.  We had to finally ask for a check after we had finished our food and sat around for a while.  The service wasn't great and the whole experience took three hours from the time we arrived till the time we left. We will not be going back. I'm pretty patient when out to dining but this experience goes down as one of the worst I've had.",

The cocktail was so yummy, and I can't wait to try their other fun and tasty cocktails!  For dinner, I had the Ahi Crunchy entree salad - seared rare with field greens, Asian slaw and crispy wontons tossed with soy vinaigrette.  The salad was fresh and delicious.

    "text": "Great happy hour, thats for sure. It will keep me coming back! Beer selection is AMAZING. I'd steer clear from any \"signature cocktails\" because everything they use \"dekyuper\" in everything which 1) makes everything overly sweet 2) clearly these drinks are overpriced. Most cocktails tasted like Four Loko, so why not drink the Four Loko at a cheap price and really have an 'experience'  Food is mediocre but its easy to bring a group of people here because, just like the beer, they have a little something for everyone. Artichoke and Wings were delicious.  Service is always a little slow. My bartender seemed a little confused and scatterbrained. Its Sunday and its not even busy. The other bartender did not even acknowledge my presence. But the barback was very attentive on how he could actually help in any way possible.  Our Halibut and Filet were literally drowned in sauce, so I'd recommend sauce on the side. Wedge salad was good, but we had an up-charge for bacon! Wedge salad standard is wedge, bacon, bleu cheese. Simple. Its like charging me extra for my bacon on a bacon cheeseburger!  When we sat at the table, the girl was incessantly hovering over us. I get it, you are there. We are also a table of four- two couples who are clearly just trying to have a relaxed dinner. Its not busy and I know I'm not taking up your table! Give me some space, please!  All in all, its not bad. Always consistent so you know what to expect. Mediocre food and great beer. I'll be back, not sure when, but I'll be back.  Side note- We tried to watch a hockey game that was clearly playing at Sports Booking next door, but they couldn't play it here. If you have that many TVs, invest in some NHL/NFL/NBA packages. Yard House has the potential for a great sports bar, and we all know Summerlin needs a good sports bar and if you played every game, every time, I'd be here all day everyday.",

Repeatedly, it never fails that my drink sits empty before being refilled for at least 5-10 minutes. Every time. Without fail. Food quality seems to be lowering, due to the success of the company. No need to win over customers anymore. Management even walked right by our table, seeing my empty glass along with my husbands and did not even blink.

The food was on par for what I'd expect out of a spot like this but a little pricey. Really great atmosphere for watching sports.",

    "text": "Came here two days in a row. When I came for lunch yesterday the service was mediocre at best, and the food came out freaky fast. That might be a plus, but it just seemed rushed honestly. Came today, tried using a $15 off voucher I received from the casino and was told at the very end they don't honor them. Honestly the only reason I came back for Sunday brunch was because the server talked it up so much during our Saturday lunch. Sunday brunch was $15 for unlimited mimosas, bloody Mary's, and house beers. Awesome. We get sat outside by ourselves in the corner next to some strange smelling bush. Then we moved. The unlimited drinks for $15 is a scam. Our food came out within 10 minutes of ordering off the brunch menu, and it was cold. Server came back to check on us too late, I had just surrendered at the point and began eating my lukewarm food. The server rarely comes back to check on you, we waited 45 minutes at one point for refills on our mimosas. We asked for double mimosas and the server just brought us very much predominately OJ \"mimosas\". It was a very disappointing brunch and the management know that they are part of a shady practice with the $15 off vouchers, but they won't do anything to change it with the casinos even though they aren't part of the program honoring the $15 off. Seriously, this place was just terrible.",

    "text": "I gotta admit, I'm a pretty big fan.  I like cheap.  I like tasty.  This review is for the Happy Hour part at Yard House...I've never eaten any regular meals there!  Everytime we've gone, it's for Happy Hour.  Yes, Yard House does keep me happy!  Just look at my check-ins for this place.  OK, yes, it's bar food, and yes, it's nothing overly stellar.  But for what they do it is remarkable in terms of food.  And the prices!  You can easily get away for feeding a group of four for under $35.  Take your kids, take your friends, double date!  A good time can be had for little cost.  Yard House has Happy Hour M-F from 3 PM - 6 PM, Sun-Wed from 10 PM - Close.  Lots of opportunity to stock up on grub!  Our first time here was on a hunch since we were staying at Red Rock Casino at the time for my birthday.  We've been back at least twice a month since!  Payday = YHHH day (Yard House Happy Hour).  Most days, especially weekdays after 5 PM Yard House is packed!  The good thing about their Happy Hour is that you can sit ANYWHERE in the restaurant and partake in the cheapy goodness.  No need to only sit at the bar or the patio.  Happy Hour indeed!  We bring our kids quite often to eat with us.  For Happy Hour at Yard House there is a plethora of food and drink selections.  Pints (of a $hi+load of different choices) go fron $3.75 - $5.75 range.  Half yards go from the $7.50 - $10.00 range, house martinis are $6.50, and specialty drinks and wine by the glass are $2.00 off.  But honestly, I come for the food!  For me Yard House does not disappoint!  Yard House has a bunch of appetizers and pizzas that are 1/2 price during Happy Hour.  Choices abound, variety too!  Some of our most ordered faves:  -Spicy Thai Chicken or BBQ Chicken Pizza -Fried Calamari -Hawaiian Poke Stack (most def a fave) -Onion Ring Tower -Chicken Nachos (another fave) -Seared Ahi Sashimi (yet another fave) -Spicy Tuna Roll (it's not sushi but we like it anyway) -Buffalo Wings -Chicken or Mushroom Lettuce Wraps  On most occasions we will have nearly all these items on our table!  We are piggies!  It's a good thing the tables at Yard House are HUGE.  No matter though, whatever we don't finish we take home for leftovers later!  Although we ALWAYS end up finishing the Hawaiian poke stack and the seared ahi.  Those are very ONO.    Yard House doesn't offer sushi like other Happy Hour joints around Las Vegas but no matter.  Their food usually fits the bill pretty good.  Another plus?  Each dish available during Happy Hour ranges from $5 - $8...and they are full appetizer servings!  Cheap, and lots of it.  A very good choice for decent eats in the Summerlin area!  I have a beer (or three), and a few appetizers and I'm as happy as a clam during Happy Hour.  It is a good time.  Service is very courteous and pretty quick, even during peak Happy Hour time.  Keep up the cheap eats Yard House, I will be back!  H-A-P-P-Y H-O-U-R",

    "text": "Although Yard House is known for its variety of beers, their food is not to be overlooked.   Spinach Cheese Dip ($11.85) - Feta, Jack, Parmesan, Cream Cheese, Crispy Flatbread (This dish is Vegetarian)  This dish came out hot and ready, it was not too cheesy and the portions were equal from flat bread to dip.   Ahi Crunchy (starting at $11.95) - Seared Rare, field greens, Asian slaw, crispy wontons, soy vinaigrette. (Under 600 calories)  This dish is my mothers favorite because the ahi is seared perfectly and seasoned just right. The vinaigrette is not too over powering and blends very well with the freshness of the fish.   Miso Glazed Sea Bass ($29.65) - Bok Choy, carrots, edamame, jasmine or brown rice Best dish in the house by far!! If you're a fan of seafood, this is prepared to perfection! Though the glaze was a bit overwhelming, we will be sure to get the glaze on the side next time.  Lobster Garlic Noodles ($22.85) - Shrimp, Crab, Lobster, shiitake mushrooms, spinach, parmesan.  Only a few pieces of lobster with some shredded crab and whole shrimp, this dish was very delicious. I had wished the noodles were a little more powerful in the garlic flavor, but that is just my personal option.   Mini Creme Brulee ($4.85) - Vanilla bean custard, chocolate, caramelizes bananas.  Presentation caught my eyes first and you know what they say, you eat with your eyes first. After indulging in this dessert, I found happy surprises of chocolate chips at the bottom of the ramekin. Delicious!   Also! Thank you to our waiter Gary for providing us excellent service, he had made our dining experience all the more enjoyable.",

The place was packed and they had a 40 minute wait for lunch.  Once we were seated, our fantastic waitress brought us waters and offered some suggestions on the menu. We started with the chicken tender appetizer and I got a barbecue chicken salad for lunch. I went for the small size which was still way too big. Note to others: do not get the regular size unless you're planning on eating it for 3 meals straight. Seriously.  The chicken tenders hit the spot--not overbreaded and still had some flavor. My salad I didn't enjoy quite as much, but it certainly wasn't bad. It had a good portion of chicken along with lots of other fix ins that made it truly a barbecue chicken salad instead of a salad with chicken and barbecue sauce.  We also split a brownie for dessert. It was way too hot but still excellent and a good way to finish a good meal.  Again, our waitress was fantastic and on top of everything. Food was good, service was good, atmosphere was good. I was impressed.",

They usually have seasonal or local selections on tap as far as beer, in addition to their big menu, and their Happy Hour is quite good ($2 off draft and cheap food specials).  And on mondays during football season it is Happy Hour all day.  The food is nothing spectacular but I believe it is better than the average pub.  And with the selection of beer, it's tough not to enjoy yourself.  It is great for watching sports and i recommend this place if you just want to hang out, drink some beer, and watch the game.",

The sandwich was full of flavor and the fries were crispy. The waiter came by and offered my friend with the birthday a choice of mini desserts. The dessert came on a decorated plate along with a candle. It was a nice gesture from the restaurant to celebrate birthdays. I liked how it wasn't over the top: no parade of waiters and no singing.

    "text": "Short version of this review: Do not order the chicken tenders or boneless chicken unless you like dry and tasteless.    Have dined at Yard House over the years and always been pleased with the food (albeit it is somewhat pricey. . .so I recommend taking advantage of the 3 to 6pm happy hour pricing).  And while the service can be slow at times, the wait staff is friendly and accommodating.  Having said that, I went back recently and ordered the chicken tenders.   In the past, I found their tenders to be very juicy and tasty (certainly felt like I was getting something higher quality than what I could purchase at the grocery store frozen food aisle).  Unfortunately, Yard House noticeable changed their fry batter to some supposedly healthier version...and the tenders are frankly awful!!!  See the picture below (pictures don't lie).  I noticed it right away when the food came out -- the tenders looked incredibly dry.  And they tasted just as bad as they looked.  We asked our server about it, who acknowledged that \"corporate\" had dictated that they use this new \"healthier\" batter recipe for their tenders and boneless wings.  If I wanted healthy, I would be buying grilled chicken and not fried chicken tenders.  I'm not looking for my \"breaded\" chicken to be healthy.  Bad move Darden...major misstep on your part  that I strongly recommend you remedy asap.  And until such time as I know you have switched back (or at least switched away from this horrible excuse of fry batter), I will never be ordering their chicken tenders or boneless chicken ever again.   To end on a positive note, the Carnivore pizza was good as were the sliders -- since they had not changed the recipe for those dishes.  The fries were the same as always (I should've ordered them as truffle fries to give them a bit of flavor).  The non-poultry food and the service made this visit a solid 3.75 stars.  So my 1 star review is all because of how disappointed I was with the chicken and to send a message to management and corporate that they need to go back to the original batter recipe (and to the extent they feel compelled to keep this un-tasty version, then put it on their menu of healthy items -- since people do not expect a healthy chicken tender to taste good).",

No chili cream cheese, no spinach, no carrots, little cilantro and green onion...no flavor.  Very disappointing. Chicken wings were good but we got them plain. Ahi salad consisted basically of slaw and ahi, ...no greens, few wontons and dressing, little taste, too. The mixed field greens salad was fresh but it took two tries to get any dressing. Not a good choice, overall, especially since it was 2pm and the restaurant was pretty empty.",

    "text": "I went for takeout on a packed Thursday evening. I didn't see any signs for takeout, so I went in the back to the host stand where I assumed it was. Upon asking to place an order, I was informed that a \"takeout specialist\" would be summoned.  This is ominous sounding if you think about it, and that didn't distract me from the fact that no one seemed to be designated for takeout orders.   After waiting for the \"specialist\", I ordered the skirt steak salad, which was $17.45. As listed on the menu, the salad should have steak, peppers, avocado, asparagus, chips, onion, tomato, pickled egg, gorgonzola vinaigrette. Mine had no avocado and a few small pieces of tomato, which I discovered after I was home. No wonder it was ready rather quickly. For $17.45, leaving off even one item is f#c&ed up.  I expected a big salad, and this one had plenty of steak but needed more lettuce, as well as all the ingredients as listed. Instead of using asparagus tips, the pieces I had were pretty bland tasting. The red peppers were pretty good, and the pickled egg was OK. The dressing was mostly gorgonzola chunks. There were quite a few chips, which are very garlicky. I liked them. The salad was presented to go nicely, with the steak in a separate container & dressing on the side. They got that right, for sure. No bread, however, maybe they forgot that too???",

We waited about 40 minutes to get seated which was fine, but the food was average. It was filling and came pretty quick but there was not anything unique about It.

He was always available for questions or recommendations for food and beer. I had some amazing stout beers while I was here too! For an appetizer, we shared the Buffalo Cauliflower with a spicy tahini sauce. It was the perfect amount of heat and the sauce brought it all together. Seriously will go back to get those every time! For an entree, we shared the Red Quinoa Salad. This was the best, most nutrient-dense salad I've had in a while. Few ingredients such as kale, red quinoa, blueberries, pumpkin seeds, and cauliflower. You definitely be full from this salad. The finish up with dessert, we had a S'mores Brownie. Chuy brought it back with \"Happy Birthday\" in cocoa powder with a lit candle.

    "text": "So sad I used to dig YH but after today I'm debating going there again -Summerlin. We waited for awhile for our server bc her table of guys held her up by talking forever. Not her fault but we were starving! I ordered cheese curds bc I love \"cheese\" so many Tiny pieces and then tons of burnt shells with no cheese!(she did tell the manager later and he took them off the bill sorry but $11 was pushing it for the lack of cheese in cheese curds). Sigh. I got a blackened chicken Cesar salad small portion ($8.95/as opposed to $13) literally barely any chicken so disappointed. I could have made myself a small chicken less salad at home. My guest had Nashville hot chicken but it wasn't \"hot\" maybe Luke warm w the cold coleslaw on top they took it back and by the time he got his food I was almost done eating bc my salad had too much dressing & usually I'm all about extra but this was soggy so I had to eat it fast. Overall just so disappointing. I just moved to Summerlin and was excited to go to YH & have a to go place when friends visit. Now I'm not so sure.",

I guess my mistake number 1 was going to this location on a Saturday night. Super freaking hungry, at that. Ended up waiting almost 2 hours. Okay, whatever. We get seated. Got my usual order of Mac+Cheese. Really, really gross. I don't know what the hell happened.. the cheese tasted worse than Velveeta. Tasted worse than Mac & Cheese TV Dinner cheddar. Barely had any chicken. NO Truffle Oil whatsoever. I can't believe I paid $20 for that crap. Was so hard to eat.... urgh. It was just disgusting! Plus, the server sucked balls. Totally forgot about us. Never came back to check on us.. we had to share each other's waters. We waited almost 20 minutes after we tried eating that disgusting food... just to get someone's attention to grab our server so we can get our check and get the hell outta there. Then he had the nerve to say \"Don't worry! I didn't forget about you.\" Uhm, you did. Jerk. I just replied \"yes. you did.\" He did a little laugh.. that made me want to punch him in his douche-y face.  Bye.",

I tried the Wisconsin fried cheese curds which were delicious he sauces with them were the highlight, the horseradish was simple and added a little flavor the cheese curds however the honey sauce was my favorite and just a little kick. For lunch I enjoyed the lamb burger which was amazing the feta cream was light and added so much flavor. I subbed buffalo cauliflower for my side and was not disappointed the spice was manageable. For dessert the mini crem brulee which is topped with bananas. We were celebrating a graduation and our awesome server made sure it was done right. OH AND THEY HAVE GREEN TEA so it's a yes for me",

Our service at the yard house is always great, Our food and our servers did a great job also.  we ordered appetizers first I got boneless buffalo hot wings .  The wife got calamari and blue crab cakes of course it all came on time and was very good!  Now for the main course:  NY STEAK SANDWICH- comes with swiss, fried onions, tomatoes, garlic aioli and brioche of course I got nothing but Swiss and the aioli on the side aka (naked).  The wife got hers with everything.  PIZZA- the kids got pepperoni pizza they destroyed it and ate some of our food too!   OVERALL the food was great! We will continue to visit the yard house to celebrate or just to enjoy the happy hour as long as we can.  I'm very pickey when it comes to food but this is definitely a place that I keep in my line up when it comes to a solid menu.",

But once we sat down, service was quite fast! At this late time in the evening I was starving and ordered immediately - I wanted the loaded Nachos with fries instead of chips. The waitress said it was no problem at all and there was no upcharge!  The plate that arrived had to be at least a foot long and it was piled high with Fries and a very generous amount of toppings! My empty tummy's dream come True!! For some reason the other people at the table assumed I got these to share....it was heartbreaking to do it, but I knew I needed to seem like a nice person and not show my inner fat self. Sharing with my husband is hard enough and has taken years of practice. But I stilled enjoyed them immensely and would certainly return to eat these specifically!!  We also shared a salad and I'm glad we ordered a large because they don't run quite as big as the loaded fries.",

I really should have posted a review of previous exceptional staff, but yesterday reminded me that this is well deserved.  Ps: Please don't 86 the Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat beers. That is our favorite.   Update*** We visit YardHouse often. Service food is always amazing and glad that you continue to have that Tangerine Wheat on tap. I want to give a shout out the the manager, i believe her name is Jenn. She has helped us the last couple Sundays and her hospitality was amazing. The first time, she went out of her way to have certain games playing in our view. The next was expediting an order for a family member that had a medical concern. Thank you.

It's Pinto Beans, Cheese, tender pieces of Chicken & Pasilla Peppers layered in between Corn tortillas & topped with a Red Chile & Tomatillo sauce and a dollop of Sour cream.

(Just do yourself a favor & get this!) - LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE ($25.75): A generous amount of lobster & pasta with sundried tomatoes, asparagus, wild mushrooms with cheddar cheese, parmesan & truffle oil. (Was skeptical to order this because of the price... but wow. The value is so worth it! Such a mouth orgasm, and I was impressed by the amount of lobster they put!) - BLACK TRUFFLE CHEESEBURGER ($12.85): A thick patty with house made truffle cheese, a flavorful tomato-bacon-onion jam, with a side of fries.

Second off, our server Janine was a pleasure!  ok to the not fun part.  $30something dollar Lobster Mac and Cheese, well the lobster was a very chewy and had more an off fish taste than lobster. The Mac and cheese was so over oiled, it became a match of keep it down or throw it up later into the night. It came back up. This was only 6 bites or so of the dinner. The rest is in the fridge for my roommate today.  The fish and chips. The breading tasted like cardboard, the fish tasted stale. I feel like malt and tabasco are the only thing that helped me get this down. I don't drink so there was no masking the crap quality of what I was eating. I gladly shared with the table so I didn't have to eat it or complain on a 2nd dish of food we ordered.  Brussels sprouts and potato, well they got this right... you can't really messed up quick frying with a dash of salt.  Aside from the horrible food a glass of house wine is $16. Was not fun to see our table not knowing had ordered 6 total glasses of wine. $96 on wine at a chain place known for beer?  anyway. mistake was made, this place can have your hard earned $. Won't be getting any more of mine. There are tooooo many way better places in town for way less $.  Over all... this will be a happy hour visit from now on. As you don't feel like you wasted $96 on cheap wine, $60+ on food for a bad taste in your mouth and a puke later in the night.",

The place is really cramped and loud, not what i like if im going out to eat. Its cool if u want to go cheer on a game or be loud and drink with friends, tvs EVERYWHERE U TURN, but that wasnt what we were into that night. Took awhile for our waiter to come over, when he did he was very nice, took our drink order. Ordered apps and dinner, it took soooo long to come out. We were not impressed at all everything even the drinks were just ok. I guess their main draw is beer????",

We have never been to yard house but got a gift card for a birthday and decided to have a nice meal. We wanted to indulge so we ordered the cheese curds and the ahi nachos to start. How you can ruin fried, cheese I will never know. Greasy, hard and stringy in texture. We barely even touched them. The ahi nachos were mediocre at best. I thought you couldn't go wrong with a BBQ chicken salad... I was wrong. It tasted like something a beginner cook made in a hurry for a pot luck. It had no flavor and was just drenched in overly caloric dressing. It was basically mush. To end the meal we had a chocolate souffle that tasted like a frozen at home microwave chocolate lava cake. It was dense and horrible. The entire meal was extremely underwhelming. Even their soda tasted like pure syrup. Sad. I hate when I go out for a nice meal and then my night is ruined by a horrible food I don't want to waste my hard earned money on.",

They are conveniently located in red rock casino but you can get to a entrance from outside. They do not take reservations for two people, but you can call and get on the waitlist. My server was not friendly, and never once smiled.   There was no wait so we sat down right away, we were there for the late-night Sunday happy hour (10pm-close)  I can't believe the outdoor patio is open with how cold it is outside, but they have heat lamps and people seemed comfortable.  Me on the other hand, I was freezing my butt off with my jacket on inside ha ha  One thing I do not like about Yard House is that every time I try to add on a salad they say I must either have ranch or Cesar and I tell them I am dairy free and they say there is nothing they can do about it.  I am sure you can whip up some oil and vinegar somewhere no?",

Our waitress, very politely, justified the delay on the time it takes to cook the chicken. When we got our food, the plates were HOT, but when we tasted the food, both dishes were COLD! The enchiladas, the rice, the chicken, ect. Makes me think if food is not freshly and hot prepared, but microwaved and put on a hot plate. The manager in turned came to apologize and told us he and the chef  touched verified it was cold. He had it redone and offered us an appetizer, we declined. The second round was good but it took again forever. We were patiently at this restaurant for at least 2 hours and we requested a discount on our bill, and we only got the $8 appetizer taken out on a $70 biil for two persons.  I feel the manager was not sensitive enough on the discount for all the time we spent waiting for warm food.",

This location is located off the strip in Summerlin, which is more convenient to get to.  Red Rock Resort is also a great spot to visit along with the mall nearby. Good food, friendly staff, and a great selection for all types of palettes. Love the beer and wine selection too. This past visit I had the pork burger (no bun - which they're happy to do) and the side chopped salad.  Good stuff!  Can't wait to go back when the weather warms up to sit on the patio.",

The servers are very friendly and they are very good at giving suggestions when it comes to their drinks, they will even let you sample on beers. My favorite is their poke nachos, it's very flavorful, has a little bit of spiciness to it because of the sriracha mayo on top. The serving size is big, two people can share it but I can finish everything myself. One time I thought I try something else so I ordered their pepperoni pizza. The flavor is ok, nothing special also it was super greasy. Check his place out especially during their happy hour. I personally wouldn't go here on their regular hours unless I'm craving for their Ahi Crunch, which is really good too.",

It's always busy, wondering if the entire Summerlin is eating there, but despite the volume of people they handle everything extremely well. The ladies upfront that you check in with are always pleasant and attentive. There's normally always a wait, but the wait is worth it and they normally buzz you earlier than they tell you the wait is. I recommend happy hour which has an amazing appetizer called Poke Nachos. I also love the mushroom lettuce wraps. Aside from the amazing food, they have one of the best waiters in town. He provides excellent service each time, that I request him when I go in. His name is DERICK and he's consistent with being attentive to where you never have to ask for anything or flag him down. He''s always watching the table no matter how busy it is. I highly recommend trying DERICK as your server as you wont be disappointed, along with the amazing food Yard House has to offer. Excellent Service+ Excellent food=THE BEST!  P.S. Not a place to take a date. It's really loud and you won't be able to have a conversation.",

Now you've changed your fries to soggy, below average, potato sticks!!??   Sorry..but there are too many restaurants in Vegas with better food..and beer.  The one small thing that set you apart from other places were your skinny, crispy fries.  That one, small change will prevent me and my family from visiting your restaurant.   So...if the change of fries is an indication that you're trying to save money..I don't see it as a positive outlook.   Every time a restaurant changes things that are working..just to save a buck...they go downhill fast.  Good luck.  I'll be going across the street or next door from now on!",

Ugh...just nasty.  When they were brought to the table, we thought they forgot the chicken.  The chicken was pulverized and looked like brown sugar.

Our experience last night was a good one.  We ordered firecracker wings, hummus, and spinach dip.  Everything was tasty, and the service was very good.  The highlight of the night?  Beer floats!  Yup, who knew beer + ice cream = awesome.  Yard House offers a double chocolate stout with vanilla ice cream and a raspberry framboise with vanilla ice cream.  I tried both.  The chocolate stout really has a strong cocoa note and nice depth.  Really yummy stuff.  I have a serious sweet tooth, so I loved the framboise with the vanilla ice cream.  That beer is delicious and redolent of raspberry fruitiness.  If you haven't had a beer float before, I'd encourage you to try this for dessert!",

We like the darker malty beers and lately for us it's been all about trying their Belgian Trappist styles.  Their own one is fantastic, and so are all the others we've tried so far (try saying that, or anything, after two 10% alcohol content goblets).  HH food is great.  We've tried quite a few things, our favorites are the Thai pizza, the lettuce wraps, and the Bearnaise sliders.  HH prices for beer and food are great, and service has nearly always been top notch.  On our last trip we were lucky enough to have Areannia (not sure about the spelling, but the 'i' is silent, hey I don't make this stuff up).  The most patient, sweetest, nicest, most helpful waitress you'll ever meet.  Great place to hang out with friends, I wish we had a Yard House where we live.",

There is a ton of beers on tap & the menu is one of the fanciest & most diverse, that I have ever seen in a bar. I am not saying that this is the best restaurant, even though it is better than most. In  the Red Rock Casino, there are many places to eat, for the price, this is one of the best & better than the Cafe by a wide margin.   The downside: Yes, it is loud. It is not a good place to bring kids. During peak hours, you may have to wait to get a table. They only have shoe string French Fries. Portion size is on the smaller side.  The Pluses: Great menu. BEERS! Very friendly, attractive staff. Open later than most of the Red Rock other restaurants. Not packed with kids like BJ's Brewery across the street. Reasonable prices, for the quality of food that they serve. Fast service.",

The food was fine, no complaints or problems, and the service was acceptable - but the noise & crowds were beyond bad.  There were four of us and it was only possible to talk to a person on either side of you because you could lean over and yell to them - couldn't yell loud enough to the 4th person across the table.  So, unless you're dining with someone who you don't want to actually talk to, I wouldn't recommend this place on a Saturday night ;)",

I would normally say this place is too trendy for me but there were huge families with tons of kids everywhere, which just didn't seem appropriate and weird.  Who the fuck would want to take their family to a place that serves so much beer and the music is so loud you can hardly hear yourself speak?  I don't get it.  There's nothing good about going here, from the hour long waits to just get a table and then another hour to be served the overpriced food.  My husband and I, only ordered an appetizer, a dinner, and 3 beers and paid $60 with tip.  There are so many other places that serve the same food in a more timely manner, cheaper, and without the loud music blaring that I'm not sure why people go here.  And what is with making people enter from the outside and not from the casino?  There's no way in hell I would return.",

    "text": "I've been here twice, so this is a combined rating of both experiences.  The first time I went was in April at 6pm with my girlfriend. The  I ordered the the Chilled Edamame, Grilled Sweet Korean BBQ Beef and a half portion of the Ahi Crunchy Salad. I also ordered a glass of pinot noir and a large bottle of sparkling water. I can't recall what my friend ordered, so I'm only going to write about my experience. Our waitress seemed friendly enough, however she spoke so fast, that it was difficult to understand her. After we placed our order, we didn't see her for almost 20 minutes. A runner delivered my friend's drink and my sparkling water, however, the pinot noir was no where to be found. Then the edamame came out and my friend's appetizer, still no wine. We asked another waiter (not ours bc we still couldn't find her) if they could check on my wine. Our next courses came out -- Korean BBQ Beef, which was hot and tender with great sweet and tangy flavor and the white jasmine rice was hot and the perfect stickiness.  We started to eat, but I wanted to have my wine with my meal, so I ate slowly. 10 minutes later, I had to ask yet another waiter about the status of my wine, and they went to find our waitress, who finally brought my wine 15 minutes later. The Korean BBQ Beef was still good though, even though it was cold from waiting for the pinot noir. My salad came out shortly after by yet another waiter, then our original waitress came by and said that she was transitioning our table to another waiter since she was going on break, which was laughable bc to us, she had been on break for 45 minutes. Our new waitress asked us if we wanted to order dessert, which I did, a scoop of caramel ice cream. My GF also placed a take away order for her husband to bring home, so I assumed that while we waited for his food, the waiter would bring out my dessert. But instead, they brought out my dessert when they brought out his take away food. So I had to eat my ice cream really fast so the take away food wouldn't get cold.   Food Score: A Service Score: D+ Atmosphere: B+ (a little loud, but fun and ively)  The second time I went to  YH was on Sat night during Memorial Day Weekend. The place was packed so we got put on the wait list, and then went to the bar. Fortunately, 2 seats opened up at the bar, so we decided to eat at the bar instead, which was good for me bc I knew that my drink would come out much faster than the time. Our bartender was friendly and took our beverage order right away while we looked at the menu. We both had Stellas and then we ordered the Onion Rings Tower and Hummus to start. The food came out pretty quickly and the onion rings were nice, crispy and hot, but the hummus was runny and slimy and had a weird after taste, so we didn't finish that dish. I had liked the Korean BBQ Beef dish the first time, so I ordered it again for my main, while my husband ordered the Spicy Jambalaya with Brown Rice. That food came out in a timely manner, however, my dish was very disappointing and my husband's came out with white rice, so they took it back. Instead of replating it, they scooped out the white rice and put brown rice on the same plate, which was now a total mess. My husband was so hungry and didn't want to wait, that he ate it anyway, but we both couldn't believe that it didn't get replated. I was really looking forward to my dish bc it was so good the first time, however, this time, the beef was dry, much smaller pieces, almost shriveled and lacking any of the juicy flavor from last time and the rice was also dry and cold. I was hungry, so I ate it anyway. I was afraid to send it back bc it could've been worse, especially after what happened to my husband's dish when he sent it back. Our bartender asked us if we wanted dessert and I told her we wanted the caramel ice cream and she said that they didn't have it. She told me that I must be mistaken, bc it's not on the menu. I told her that I had it last time in April, and she said that they didn't, but instead, recommended the salted caramel butterscotch pudding. We ordered that instead, and we're glad we did bc it was quite good. Still annoying though that she said that they didn't have caramel ice cream bc I just checked the menu online and there it was -   ICE CREAM vanilla, caramel, mango sorbet, java chip, mint chocolate chip  Food Score: C- Service Score: B+ Atmosphere: B+ (a little loud, but fun and ively)  I really wanted to like this place based on previous reviews. My husband and I are both in the hospitality industry and we like to support local businesses, so we may give it one more try, especially since it's conveniently located. Hopefully the third time's a charm and the service and food will both be good.",

Drinking delicious craft and localish (west coast) beers out of a 3 foot tall glass makes me feel like the president.  It's usually pretty dark inside, but they have a great patio seating area so you can choose your preferred ambiance.   The food is upscale American dishes, but not snooty. I would strongly recommend the freakin SOUTHERN CHICKEN BREAST....also have had the roast beef dip sandwich, chicken with penne, and burgers. All very good and the fries are small and skinny like a baby's shoestrings and are money.  Only thing to avoid is the margherita pizza. It made my girlfriend emit garlic from her pores for two days afterwards and she lost a job because of it.  Just joking on the job, but the smell was very real and pungent.",

They want to charge $13 for an appetizer that consisted of a few chunks of fish that sit on top of one large chip.  Underneath the chip is the \"filler\" of some kind of raw slaw then a few more chunks of fish hiding under it.  Oh, and the avocado?  A few slivers (maybe a 1/4) of an avocado) sitting off to the side.  That is not a poke stack.  If they want to serve it that way, then it should be on the snack portion on the menu for $5.  It was a pathetic interpretation.  I still love Yard House and will continue to dine there, but prefer to stick to what I know is good.",

I don't know what it is, but their food taste the same.  There is a selection here so you will have no issue finding what to eat.  I usually just get the salmon which is tough for anyone to mess up.

I think it's safe to say that I liked this location a lot better than the one at Town Square! When we walked in we were immediately sat! Awesome right off the bat! Our waiter David was ummm... full of energy to say the least... The drinks that were ordered did the job for sure. I have to recommend the \"Escalade Margarita\" for all those margarita lover's because let me tell you it's fantastic! Food was meh and the only reason I didn't give them 3 stars was because of the service. Truffle fries are amazing. The sliders that are on the appetizer are not so great, wasn't impressed. The jerk chicken boneless wings we ordered tasted nothing like \"Jerk Chicken\" and we were honestly too hungry to send them back but I would NOT order those again. desert was some new crumble cake not exactly sure but check my pictures! Overall I would return especially for the drinks!",

I was happy to see some local brews on the list.  I had a couple of beers that were good.  Barkeeps were friendly and on top of things.  Everyone loves Olivia.  That happens when you're attractive, friendly, and bring glasses of beer to people.  One complaint, I ordered a second beer just before the end of happy hour.  The beer was brought then the beer was added to my tab.  I looked at the tab, I missed the happy hour price by 1 minute.  But the order was put in a couple of minutes before the order was entered on the computer.  There should be some push back on that, or servers should know to ring up the order first.  Not a huge problem over a dollar (or whatever the happy hour savings is).",

    "text": "Went there for lunch.  Had been to only one other Yard House, which was at Town Square and I loved it!  Was looking very forward to meeting up with a group of ladies from our social meet up group and have another great experience, but at a location closer to home.  I ordered the Tomato Bisque with Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  The Tomato Bisque was wonderful......but the Grilled Cheese was VERY bland.  No flavor at all.  Extremely disappointing.  I also had a French Vanilla Cappuccino, but it was VERY bland - almost like it was watered down.  But the BIGGEST disappointment was our waitress, Janine I believe her name tag read.  She was not very attentive or pleasant.  Our whole table was talking about it,  Maybe she was just busy.  HOWEVER, it took us FOREVER to get her attention so I could ask for a refill on my ice water.  After one of my friends was finally able to stop her, and asked if I could get a refill on my water, she said \"Sure.\" And while walking away from the table my friend and I heard her say, \"I'm keeping an eye on your table.\". We were shocked and just looked at each other for a second.  Then I picked up my water glass and said to my friend, \"Well, if she's keeping an eye on our table, then my water glass wouldn't be empty now would it?\"  Unfortunately, because of her over all service or lack there of today, I gave her probably less than a 10% cash tip so that I could get my point across.  I'm usually AT LEAST a 20% tipper.  Over all, not the greatest experience at your restaurant, not sure I'll be back, and I won't be recommending this location to anyone.  The consensus was the same with all the ladies in my group.  That's SEVEN customers that probably won't be eating at your restaurant again.",

They also have a great happy hour where appetizer's are half off from 4-6pm and in the evening 9-close  The only part i did not like about this place was they did not take reservations. A person like me who hates to wait because I lack the luxury of free time m would like to make reservations.  Overall the staff is friendly and their food is good.  This place is LOUD and it is hard to talk with other people without scremaing.  So if your dining here make sure your ready to scream you conversations..  We had the spinach and artichoke dip which was so freaking good and their poke, lettuce wraps and their bbq chicken salad.. 4 people actually shares all this asian style and made us all full.. If your into sharing and tasting all kinds of foods i suggest ordering appetizer's or sharing your entrees..  It's a great way for everyone to taste the food..",

Sometimes you sweat out all the toxins out of your body and then immediately go put things way worse than you have been eating for a long time back into your body because you were just in an oven for 90 minutes trying to contort your body. Sometimes you go to Yard House because your friend has a gift certificate and all you want is nachos.   Yes, I took a Bikram yoga class and replenished my body by not drinking a protein shake or eating something with nutritional value but by coming to Yard House and ordering a cider and happy hour nachos. I'm cool. The nachos were delicious and I usually am not a big meat eater but I snarfed the chicken nachos like it was my last meal on earth, and since I was coming from Bikram, Satan could have been coming for me, I'll never know.   One complaint: flat, gross cider. I know it's not that popular of a drink but you gotta change out that keg. It was alright though--it forced me to drink water instead of alcohol in my deflated post-Bikram state.   All in all, I would not recommend Noneifying your workout by eating here, but it was delicious and I don't regret it one ounce.",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped here on Saturday night around 10:30 p.m. after bowling for our date night, and we were so disappointed.  I have heard lots of great things about Yard House, so I was excited to try it out.  When we first entered the restaurant, we were struck by the ambiance inside.  It's beautifully decorated and well-maintained.  The hostess was nice, and asked us if we preferred to sit inside or outside on the patio.  We opted for the patio since it was a beautiful night.  We walked around to our spot and about 10 minutes went by before we were greeted by our waitress.  She advised us that she wasn't supposed to be given any more tables so she could go home, so we were her last.  It made us feel awkward and rushed.  We put in our order quickly, which was pretty disappointing because we didn't get a chance to really review the drink and menu offerings.  I was interested in trying a yummy cocktail, but I didn't get time to review the menu and I was afraid to ask questions lest the waitress need to stay around and waste time.  So, I just ordered a Coke.  My husband was going to try a few new beers, but just went with Newcastle.  At least it was on tap!  We ordered the California Roll, which is actually just a large \"cake\" of sushi.  It was supposed to be fancy, but in my opinion was lame and the staff should let people know that it's not your typical roll.  Also, we ordered it without the wasabi soy sauce, and, naturally, it was doused with it.  I also ordered the chopped salad, which, unfortunately, was covered in a disgusting dressing that I later found out was \"bloody mary vinaigrette.\"  This was missing from the menu description.  When the waitress noticed I hadn't eaten much of the salad, she asked if I liked it and I told her \"No, the dressing is too harsh and the flavors don't work well together for me.\"  She replied that it was one of her favorite things on the menu and shrugged her shoulders.  Sigh.  I had hoped maybe she would offer to have it remade without the dressing, or something.  But, she was busy waiting for us to get the heck out of there, so, that was a $10 waste of money and food.  Dinner was a bit better.  I had a margherita pizza, which, admittedly, is pretty difficult to screw up.  My husband had some orange chicken, which he said was decent enough.  I had eaten 2 pieces of pizza when the waitress came around and asked if I need a box.  Almost like: Can you please go home now?  After she brought the box, she left the check and said: \"No rush.\"  Which literally made me laugh out loud.    We paid for the entire meal and left, in quite a disappointed fashion.  I will not be going back.  I would've been happier going to Roberto's!",

Alternated with Bj's across the street! :)   This place is great . . . almost always comes with a wait though, probably because it's in the Red Rock Casino and there aren't many choices for this type of venue.  They have great patio ~ we love sitting out when the weather is nice, having a beer (hundreds on tap literally) and watching a game on TV.    The menu is enormous and the food is good!  I don't think I've ever been disappointed here, ever.  And there's something for everyone.  My favorites are the seared tuna, turkey burger (I have one everywhere I go it seems), grilled cheese n tomato soup and their wings rock too!  Hubby loves the ridiculously large chicken pot pie!    Happy Hour here is so worth it unlike other places - it's M-F 3-6 (there's also a late night happy hour too) and includes many of their appetizers and drink specials too.  It's a good one -- lots to choose from and not just the typical bar fare.    Service is hit and miss - they are usually very busy so it varies.  I've had great luck at happy hour and on the patio.  We've even been able to order for last call so when it nears 6, she lines up our beers just before the buzzer!  Everyone seems nice, but sometimes you wait awhile for your visit and I am big on service. :)  So worth it -- go ahead and stop in!",

    "text": "The perfect place if you want to over pay for crap food, service, and an atmosphere so loud you walk out with a headache.  We waited for nearly 20 minutes right next to the table we would be seated at.  The best part, it was empty the whole time.  Food came out cold, even if it were hot, it wouldn't be that good.  Way over priced although the one redeeming factor which makes it a two star was that coffee ice cream dessert.  Go to BJ's across the street!",

    "text": "After a short hike this morning at Calico Tanks, my friends and I decided to come to Yard House in Red Rock for lunch.  I've been to the Yard House in Town square, so I know what kinds of food options they have.  I typically visit the Yard House for their happy hour specials, so this lunch was going to be kind of a new experience.    One thing I've noticed about this location is that it's much bigger than the Town square location.  It was super busy, yet we got sat super fast which was a plus.  Our server was super attentive and really tried her best to engage with our party.  I really liked her personality, I wish I had remembered her name, though.  Blonde hair, maybe Breanne.  She was super awesome, whoever she was.  For lunch, I started with the Cupcake Sauvignon Blanc for $8.00.  As stated on the menu, it's from the Marlborough, New Zealand region.  I just started drinking Sauvignon Blanc recently and I thought this glass was a little to dry for my taste.  I probably should have just stuck to the Pinot Grigio I was thinking of getting.  Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio is usually a great glass, but that's what I get for trying something new.   For my entree, I got the half sandwich and cup of soup lunch special for a little less than $10.  I also added a bowl of shoe string french fries for an extra $1.80.  The half sandwich I chose was the grilled pastrami sandwich on a toasted sub bun.  The pastrami was a little tangy and was accompanied with mayo.  The bottom of the sandwich was lined with jalapenos.  Not spicy at all, I think they may have been grilled.  This sandwich was great!  As for the soup, I decided to get the clam chowder.  The day was a little brisk so I thought it was a good decision.  I didn't necessarily think the soup was the best clam chowder I've ever had.  Seemed process for some reason, maybe it was the ingredients that made it taste that way.  This soup was garnished with chopped chives.    The experience was great at the end of the day.  I wouldn't mind returning for another round after another morning of hiking.  The next time I come, I'm for sure getting the Spicy Tuna Roll on the appetizer menu.  I think it was for about $13.  My friend go this and it was sooooo good!  Seared Ahi, avocado, edamame, cucumber with a soy sauce and looked like a little sriracha.  I had the amazing opportunity to try this dish and I fell in love!  If you haven't been to a Yard House, you're missing out.  So many options, so many beers!  Get your butt down and try it out!",

During the day there is a nice family vibe, and when the sun goes down it has a thriving night life of it's own! The place is always crowdy but the service is great!   When I usually go I always get their classic sliders and it comes with a side of fries. There are four little burgers on the plate and a mount of shoestring fries. So yummy and everything you could want in a classic mini burger! Although they're small they are surprisingly filling!  Next time you want to enjoy a night out with your friends or a lunch date with your family.. This is the place to go! Not pricey and very good! :)",

    "text": "Multiple times I have attempted to eat at this location and the food is just not good enough.  I asked the waiter what his \"go to\" meal is, 3 tacos fish, carnitas and I'm unsure the third- looked and tasted like jerky, priced at $17.85.  The fish taco was edible.  The beef was undercooked and flavorless.  The third, I already described as jerky like- was heavily sauced and unrecognizable.  A cup of rice and small ramekin of beans.  I will not be ordering food here again.  They are a brew house- eat elsewhere and drink here.  The atmosphere is group friendly and they have 100+ beer on tap.  I think there are better choices for food.  Update: will give another star for restaurant's effort to get in touch regarding my experience.  If they care enough to know, I'll care enough to help/discuss.  I can appreciate the effort.",

When addressing the waitress she was very nice about it and she went directly to the manager. When he came to our table first thing he said was he doesn't know how it got in my food and it wasn't part of the recipe. . Well no shit..and then he said he won't charge that on our bill.. well I hope not!! But instead he doesn't offer a new plate or anything and just smiled. Poor management.. even the waitress asked if we wanted something else after the fact. Never coming back again who knows what else is in there food!",

    "text": "I still fail to see the Appeal of Yard House... Good idea; poorly executed   Not to cut and paste my review of the Town Square location, but they are really no different. This location just seems to have worse service; numerous errors, long waits for items, unapologetically uncaring servers...  Wrong items, spilled beers, check errors with a long wait to have corrected...  So... They have a lot of beer. Otherwise, it's pretty much Chilis or Applebees... with lots of beer. Yard House is a beer bar for the non-creative.  The list is impressive. They have some neat stuff and the 6 pack samplers change regularly. The food is good, but I can't tell if it's microwaved, so that's almost as bad as being microwaved.  A mix list provides clever names for the combos you already know and love. The servers are generally pleasant and helpful and have, at the very least, remembered the scripts for various beer questions that may arise.  It is good, not for everyone, but sometime for me.  If you are in the area to kill time, stop in, have 2 beers and see how you feel about the atmosphere and the selection.",
