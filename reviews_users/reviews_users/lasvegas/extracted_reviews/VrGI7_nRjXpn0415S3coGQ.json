I'd probably avoid the edamame, won ton noodle soup and green curry is a bit watery.  Chicken Pad Thai, crispy pork with chinese broccoli, thai special fried noodle, tom yum noodle soup all really delicious.   Would definitely recommend you to go and give it a try!",

    "text": "I was so happy with this past trip to Vegas. No... I didn't gamble and win a lot of money. But  I did find a few hole in the walls with great food and great prices.   Thai Style Noodle House was our first stop.   The restaurant is small and we filled up half the restaurant with our table of 8.   The first thing I noticed was the crazy mural on the wall... I didn't like the Vegas motif mixed with Thai gods.   But the second thing I noticed, which I was very happy about, was how well priced everything was.   All their items sounded really good. I was naturally gravitated towards the duck dishes because I rarely see duck on menus. I had one of my friends share with me so I could try more than one item.  We got a fried flat noodle dish and the duck curry.  Both dishes came out with big portions but more so for the duck curry. It came in a bigger bowl than the other curry dishes.   This part of the review is very IMPORTANT!  Do yourself a favor and skip the Thai Tea... Sure it's good and all but you got to order the Coconut Juice. It might just be the most refreshing drink you ever had.   I ordered a Thai Tea but when I tried my friend's Coconut Juice, I asked one of my friends on the other far end of the table to take it off my hands so I can order the coconut juice.   My Laotian friend also stated how authentic the food was. Laos and Thailand are close and share similar dishes.",

Surrounded by all the other Asian eateries, you could easily miss this place.    A hidden gem or a homey restaurant, call it whatever you like.  The restaurant serves food that is bold in flavor and big on values.  I ordered the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with Flat Noodles in medium spicy (4 stars) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VrGI7_nRjXpn0415S3coGQ?select=hA9qHyguVw4DhYdtn7IgzQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/VrGI...</a>.  The broth had the perfect amount of sourness.  I thought I could take it, but the medium was quite spicy.  Next time I'd go for 3/10.    My fiance ordered the Pad Thai (3 stars)  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VrGI7_nRjXpn0415S3coGQ?select=S3VtsgqrAlnTZKTrTwo5jQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/VrGI...</a>  The noodle was thinner and did not have purple cabbage or shredded carrots like most places, however, it had the right flavor and the right texture.    Realistically it's 3 1/2 stars, but I bumped it up to 4 because of the value and service.  This is definitely a neighborhood restaurant worthy of your support.",

The fried tofu on the appetizer platter had a hair sticking out of it. 3. They brought me out a soup that I didn't order, then told me they had run out of the duck used in the soup that I had ordered, then told me they could make the duck soup but it would be a wait. My friends were able to start eating right away, after a few minutes I told them to cancel my order, and they told me that they had already started cooking and couldn't cancel my order. I was then told they would, as a courtesy.  4. Some of the soups were really greasy.  Do yourselves a favor, head over to Hue Thai or the Noodle House on Ft. Apache.",

They have the best pad thai I've ever tasted- it's always moist, flavorful, and cooked to perfection! I also recommend their Chu Chee salmon! Their prices are cheap, entrees are $6-8 for huge portions! Service is fast, and when I order take out it's ready in 15 minutes by the time I get there. The restaurant is kind of small, so there could be a wait if you go there during the weekend at a busy time. They will forever be my favorite place for Thai food.",

It was a Saturday, and right at 12 noon the place filled-up and there was a crowd waiting outside the door to be seated.  98% of the people in the place were Asian - which tells me right away that it's pretty damn authentic if the locals eat here.  Their soups are fabulous and come in VERY large portions. I couldn't finish my soup it was so big.  A good value for the money as well. The decor inside is very sparse and utilitarian but it's about the food here - not the ambiance.   Go before noon or after 1:30 if you don't want to wait to be seated.",

You really can't go wrong here.  We were brought here by Thai friends who were in town from LA and now knowing there's LA spots that are even tastier than this blows my mind.  Everything was so good and this is at the top of the list for our next Vegas visit (whenever that'll be).  So GOOD!!  *Duck pad thai: this looked yummy when it arrived and was even better than it looked!! how is it that just in look it was more authentic than any other pad thai i've ever had?! So much flavor and a LOT of duck.  So GOOD! *Pad See Ew: fiance loves this dish so he wanted to try it here.  WIN! he LOVED it!  he's a big eater and yet there was still leftovers, insane! *Cant remember the name of this dish...It was Hoy something...Mussel and seafood pancake: this thing was ENORMOUS!! we almost ordered 2 since the pic didnt look that big but we figured we'll get 1 and just try it out first.  It came out and wow, HUGE!  Crispy outside, doughy goodness inside with lots of mussels and seafood.  This was a hit with our entire table.  Absolutely worth the guilt of eating something fried that's this big, but mmmm DELICIOUS. *friend got the grilled pork with spicy papaya salad and rice on the side.  Forget the name of that too but dish was very flavorful.  The pork reminded me of the chargrilled viet style pork and the papaya salad had an awesome spicy kick.  YUM!  We are definitely coming back here and we've already recommended it to family and friends. :)",

The bbq pork was really tender and well seasoned and the friend rice was excellent. If you are bringing a big group, you may have to wait because it is a pretty tiny place.  I stumbled across this place because I was going to the poke place nearby, but they ran out of poke bowls. Lucky for me, this was two shops down.

DAY 1:  2 BIG mugs of Thai Iced Tea :) i especially love the huge beer mug they serve it in.  Combo Appetizer Love the chicken satay! Mmm... and the onions and cucumbers in the small bowl! Everything else was pretty good. A nice way to start.  Duck Fried Rice duuuuude, seriously, this was the hook once I opened up that tri-fold menu! It was deeeelicious, and I could not stop raving about how big the pieces of duck were in it!  #S11 The name of the actual dish slips my mind, but my boyfriend and I ordered it medium-spicy thinking it was going to be okay, but IT WAS HOT but not so hot to mask the actual food! I am not used to spice, but I ate it as fast as I could, still enjoying the dish, so as not to torture my inexperienced taste buds.  DAY 2:  Just ONE big mug of Thai Iced Tea  Thai Style Noodle House Pot Stickers You get 6 of them! They are deep fried and have 3 different sauces on them, something like a sweet mayo, then a teriyaki, and some sriracha all across the tops! Our waitress actually informed us it was the most popular appetizer ordered. Sold. It was a good mixture of sauces! Thought it would be too much, but it was great together.  Seafood Rad-Na with Wonton Saw this cute little dish hand-drawn/written on a piece of paper on the wall near us! Couldn't resist. This dish was decent, but still enjoyed it!  Three Companions (Pork) The pork is soft! It's marinated I believe, and the papaya salad and sticky rice it comes with were all good!  Then, a Thai Iced Tea to go.  Okay, so all in all, both days, both bills were under $35! The portions were large! The service is off the hook! And the environment is so friendly! The waitress with the glasses is wonderful! She remembered us from the previous day! The bathrooms are clean, both boys and girls, and we were always checked up on!  Thai Style Noodle House will definitely be a stop for me while in China Town. I do plan on returning to try the noodle soups, as I had seen several HUGE bowls of soup being served, and at reasonable prices! Forget my Pho during the winter! I'm coming HERE!",

I remember when there would be a line around the corner of the restaurant, now you can just walk in and choose from the many table available. This place has NEVER had good service, they want you to come in, eat quickly and leave. But people didn't care because the food WAS really good. WAS. There special potstickers are amazing because there are no other restaurants that can emulate it and it's one dish that is still decent. However, I used to come here all the time for Duck Fried Rice and Duck Noodle Soup, but every time I come back, the quality of the duck is terrible and it keeps getting worst. The duck used to be super moist and delicious to eat, but now its super hard, dry and tough to eat and it really takes away from the whole dish itself. Now, I also stopped by to order a Shrimp Fried Rice togo and I was disappointed to open the box that wasn't even half full.....I paid full price for not even half a dish. Not only was it half empty, but there was only 4 shrimps. This place has terrible service, but the food is the only thing that gets people to come back, if the quality of the food keeps going down, people are gonna stop coming. It's a shame because they have very unique recipes for their food, they should do these recipes some justice and make them correctly will fresh ingredients.",

We were sitting on the other side of a small decorative retaining wall - watched a cook sneeze into his hand - then continue to move the wok around ... no cleaning of the hand. I mentioned it to the waitress and was told, \"no he did not sneeze\" - I replied, \"ummmm, yes, I just watched, I was right there\" - she said, \"OK, I will take care of it\".  No other mention or concern for what occurred - or is probably occurring all the time.  In light of the Firefly, they might want to pay more attention to these small details.",

    "text": "Went to the Thai Style Noodle House for lunch today with a couple friends, (one of who is a regular there). He's addicted to the beef noodle soup, so naturally, I had to try it out as well. The first thing I noticed about this little place was the Tshirts pinned to the wall, so cheesy and SO THAI! Of course we were greeted warmly with the never fail big Thai smile from the hostess that I've come to expect from the Thais when I meet them. There were computer printout menu items with pictures scattered around the walls as well, and coupled with the Thai TV programming and Tshirts, I was reminded of a typical Thai noodle shop one can find all over Thailand.....(sigh, I miss you). I noticed on one of the printouts a picture of Penang Curry with avocado. One of my buddies wanted that, and when I mentioned to the waitress that he was a vegetarian, she quickly produced a completely separate vegetarian menu. That was cool, although he stuck with the avocado Penang curry with tofu. He ordered it at #9 of 10 in spiciness. My noodle soup arrived and was promptly devoured and washed down with a Thai iced tea. The broth was hearty, the noodles soft, and there was a large chunk of baby bok choy, and plenty of bean sprouts to compliment the meatballs and sliced beef. I thought the soup could've used a touch of cilantro, but it was very good and well balanced. I also tasted some of the avocado Penang which I thought would be too hot for my tastes, but turned out to be just right. The flavor was full, yet balanced and the tofu & avocado with the coconut & curry worked well together. The portions here are large, and overall it was a good value for the money. I look forward to returning to explore the other menu items and hopefully finding another Thai gem for my palate.",

    "text": "5 Star service, this place is very homely and hidden on the side of Wynn road.  It must compete with Dai jung gum (korean place) and Pho.  I think that their dishes are very homestyle:  The Panang and Veggie green curries are reminiscent of that from a can that I can make at home.  Their soup that comes with the lunch special however, is spectacular- No MSG and sweet from overloading of chicken and veggies.    I had the Sliced beef noodle soup, Thai style. I was anticipating something spicy sour and sweet, but instead it's just beefy broth and thin pho-like noodles...  Not quite the kind they have in texas",

It was a no brainer as this was a place I was going to try when I got to it.  Yesterday was that time.  I got a regular iced tea and I ordered the Thai spice noodles--spice level 6.  Since I didn't know how they interpret their 1 - 10 scale, I thought I'd go lower and add additional heat if needed.    The service was very good.  In about 5 minutes, I had my plate of pan fried noodles made with vegetables and chicken.  Their 6 is more equivalent to 8 at other places so I chose wisely.  My server brought me the 4 jars common to Thai places in case in needed to spice it up a bit.  The noodles were very good.  It was a filling meal.  For less than $10, I had dinner and my iced tea.  The place was quiet on this Saturday afternoon.  There was one larger family group and two women at another table.",

It's totally hole-in-the-wall, the kinda place I love and want to transport to Montana with me.   For $35 including tip and tax, I got Chicken Larb, Beef Pad See Eu, Green Chicken Curry, and Chicken Tom Ka. All were fantastic with large portions. The green curry had a potent seasoning (probably an herb that I'm not used to) and so it wasn't my favorite but it was still so excellently prepared. The Chicken Larb was crack, the best I've ever had. Tom Ka and Pad See Eu on point.   All created within 15 minutes, with fresh herbs, galangal and veg. I'm jealous of those who live so close to this place. I love Thai food.",

I was dying alone being sick in my hotel room when I was in Vegas for work... I took a day off to rest my body to survive the rest of the week. I was craving for Asian food, but I did not want to leave my room. I started browsing on Yelp and found that this restaurant delivers only for $3 delivery fee, and the minimum order was only $15! I ordered a papaya salad and pad see ew.   Within 40 minutes, a lady delivered it to my hotel! I had to go downstairs to pick up my food at the valet area, but that was understandable to me as it would take a long time for her to park her car and come upstairs. I was so so so happy that it was easy and pretty fast for a delivery order. Food was pretty good too! It definitely helped me to recover better than any food available on the Strip!",

Our appetizer were the vegetable egg rolls.  They were pretty much what we expected.  Most likely deep fried from frozen pre made.  I ordered the shrimp and chicken with silver noodles.  It was very good with a nice mild sauce.  There was no need to add any other seasoning or condiments to the dish.  I am looking forward to returning to try more dishes off the menu.

It is truly delectable!  I usually order it with a heat of 4 and add more spiciness to it depending on my mood.  I first discovered this place getting food for my wife and I one night at the Palms.  We ordered the Tom Yum Kai w/chicken.  The noodle soup was fabulous!  The amazing flavor combination of the soup was intense.  One can taste the sour, sweet, tangy and a bit of heat all in one taste.  The flavors are intense.  I then tried the duck fried rice and I was hooked!  The sweetness of the duck, combined with the heat and flavors of the rice was a perfect combination.  I love the way they put the dish together.  I've also tried the Spicy Thai noodles, Pad Thai and Pad See Eww.  All were great with a bounty of flavors.  Nothing over $10!!!  If you are looking for ambiance and romance, you probably would choose another location.

ALL solid choices.    i'm used to asian beef noodle soup, and this place makes their beef noodle soup complete different.  its not as liquid as regular asian restaurant.  but its delicious nonetheless.    the duck fried rice was bomb.  i didn't get to try that much, and my memory was fuzzy (its vegas, if your memory isn't fuzzy then you aint doing vegas right)...but from what i remember, it was really good.   the rad na was really good.  it was thin fat noodles covered in chicken and thai gravy.  super fulfilling after EDC 2011 day 1.   if you're drunk or hung over or in the mood for delicious cheap food, come to china town and go to thai style noodle house.  i promise you will not be disappointed.  money back guarantee.  I scare myself sometimes.  i have dreams that i just drive from socal to come here and eat, and then head back.  YEAAAA, its that good.",

The food is cheap and delicious and do not let the hole in the wall vibe deter you.  We had an appetizer, two dishes, and two drinks and the bill was only $25.  Pad thai was delicious and not too greasy.  The veggie pot stickers appetizer was a pleasant surprise.  The plating looked similar to something that you would see at a sushi restaurant.    If you are looking for something cheap and vegetarian, go here.",

Panag curry with chicken was abs delish, my fav. Also spicy basil w/ shrimp had a nice flavor but it was a sml portion. We had everything with brown rice which was pretty good n nutty in texure. Overall I'd def recommend this restaurant. its perfect when you want good food with cheap price tag;  Having said that,  don't go thr for the ambiance bc it's sml n plain. But yummy n delish food!! i am a fan and will def return!",

Ginger snapper was just okay as well... we wanted it deep fried but it didn't come out deep fried even though they said it was.   Lets put it like this, it wasn't good enough for me to stop searching around vegas for the ultimate thai spot.",

My man and I had 30 minutes to kill before catching \"I love you, you're perfect, now change\" at the Las Vegas Little Theater (fabulous -- check out my review!) and were disappointed to find that Hawaiian Poke was closed at 7pm. Thai Style Noodle House was the first place open in the chain of restaurants on this little piece of Wynn road, and we decided to check it out. When we opened the door, I was surprised to see how many people were dining. First, this place is an absolute hole in the wall... a clean hole in the wall, as certified by the Las Vegas Dept. of Health (love it when I see the \"A\"!). But, who cares?? The food is absolutely 5 stars! We had the Papaya Salad (loved it..though it was certainly not the star of the meal); Poh-Thack with Seafood (a Thai version of hot and sour soup -- I absolutely could not stop eating the soup... heaven in a bowl); and the Penang Avocado (who would think to put avocado in Penang curry?? love it!!) If the food is one of this venue's main stars, the other one goes to the server. When we explained that we had 30 minutes to nosh, she was incredibly accommodating so that we were able to leave with 5 minutes to spare... this, despite being the only server in this crowded little resto! I am so glad I found Thai Style and cannot wait to go back!",

My boyfriend and I had \"Spicey noodles\" (drunken noodles) and pad thai and both dishes were excellent.  We both had Thai Iced Tea and had the fried banana dish with ice cream.  The Thai Iced Tea drink was huge!  The desert was good to very good, I have had better and I have certainly had worse.  All of the items that we had ranged from good to excellent in quality.  The owners and operators of this establishment were very friendly and helpful (bad Google Maps directions got us lost).  The prices are probably among the lowest, if not the lowest that I have ever seen for Thai food.  Too bad I'm just on vacation and probably won't ever be able to return!",

We were seated immediately, and I asked for the Vegan/Vegetarian menu. After much deliberation, I ordered the Veggie potstickers and the Pad See Eu with mixed tofu and veggies.  Veggie potstickers: When ordering, I confirmed with the waiter that these were vegan without dairy and egg products. He assured me they were. When they arrived, they had a creamy sauce on it, so I asked him what it was. He said it was mayo (which I already assumed) and I proceeded to tell him that mayo is NOT vegan. He said he didn't know that, which was alarming to me, because how can you advertise a vegan menu without knowing what things are/are not vegan? He took back the potstickers and brought back another order without the mayo. He assured me that the potstickers themselves were vegan. I ate one carefully and it was okay. Nothing to call home about.   Pad See Eu (veggie) with tofu and mixed veggies: really flavorful and filling. The portion size was huge and I got lots of big chunks of tofu. I am very pleased with how this dish came out. It was only $6.95, too! Totally worth it.   Overall, I would come again for the main dishes but not the apps. The potstickers were just okay and I'm disappointed that they were not actually vegan and that the waiter didn't know that they weren't. I'm giving 4 stars because of the potsticker mishap. You can't beat the prices though!",

    "text": "I came her for an early dinner dinner before a long drive back to Los Angeles. I was recommended to come here by a friend to try their Duck Fried Rice.  This restaurant is in an awkward corner behind a long strip mall. Parking is widely available during lunch time.  We were seated immediately and ordered the recommended Duck Fried Rice and also a dish called Khua-kai (pan fried rice noodles). The Duck Fried Rice had great flavor but the rice was too soft for fried rice. Fried rice should be cooked with leftover drive that has been partially dried out. I believe they used new rice, and that caused the entire dish to be a bit too soft for my liking. The Khua-kai was dry and bland, and I didn't really understand the concept or purpose of that dish.   I will probably come here to retry the duck fried rice, and give it another try because of recommendations.",

Apache, simply because the food seems to be more flavorful- but it is a little further away for me Probably safe to say that this is my favorite place to get thai food in town. I've been able to try larb, pad Thai, pad se ew, spicy noodles, beef soups, and silver noodle salad to name a few. Everything has been simply delicious!! Good place for vegetarians- even the tofu is savory.  One of the cheaper Thai places. Most dishes run around $7-8 and the portions are great!! Almost enough to share but it's so good you won't want to. If you can't handle spicy food, be careful when ordering (scale of 1-10 spice).  Customer service is excellent. Fills up full during dinner time. I can't think of anything to complain about :-)",

In Thailand these most of the menu items are considered street food/snacks, and prices reflect as such.  Our Lyft driver asked what Thai restaurant we were going to and I mentioned Thai Style and he gave us the thumbs up. If it's good enough for locals, you know it's gotta be good!  The spiciness level is on a scale of 1 - 10 and let me tell you, I can take a lot of heat, and my mouth was tingling at 6. Heed caution when choosing your level of spice!  We ordered the following: Vegetarian Egg Rolls           $4.95 Papaya Salad                      $6.50 Fried Chicken over Fried Rice   $6.95 Chicken Pad Thai                $6.95  2x Thai Ice Tea                   $1.95 each  I've never heard of Fried Chicken of fried rice but this dish was simply exceptional! Seasoned, lean cutlets of chicken breast lightly deep fried, had a crisp crunchy outer shell. The fried rice was well seasoned all around, had bits of carrots, onions, peas, green onions, and scrambled eggs. The Pad Thai was delicious, a generous plateful of slippery rice noodles with the perfect blend of sauce and heat. I really appreciated the large side of bean sprouts, so that you can add as much and as little as you like.  It's a very family run place, the tables were all full during lunch service on a Wednesday, with a heavy flow of take-out orders.  They had some specials on their board that I definitely have to try for the next time, the one that comes to mind is Crispy Pork with Chinese Broccoli :oP  Bottom line: amazing, flavorful Thai food, served the way it was meant to at the price sure to appease everyone!",

When you want solid staple dishes like pad thai, pad see eiu, tom yum soup (best with chicken), or green curry rice (love it with shrimp!), TSNH has you covered.   But I think their specialty dishes are even better- especially the panang curry with avocado and salmon (so creamy!) and the pad ped snapper (maybe order a little lower on the spice scale than usual). Portions are generous, prices are low (rarely over $10 unless it's a seafood special), $30 can easily get a couple a takeout feast dinner with leftovers.",

Here we chose the following: Crab Rangoon - 4/5 Edaname - 3/5 - a bit soggy and not salted much Chicken soup with coconut - 4/5 tasty but not much chicken Beef Pad see ew - 3/5 - not as tasty as the Rampart location or other Thai places.  Overall, service was good, the girls did a great job. Company was good. Just the food wasn't all that, and for that I probably won't return because so many other good places to eat in this area.",

They have multiple locations, however, the chef at this location is our favorite! The portions are generous and the flavor is always on point. The ambiance is dive-y and at times the service may seem scattered, but this place stays busy since the food is En-Thai-cing! For lazy weekend nights, we always order take-out from this place without a second thought. The Appe-Thai-zing food keeps us coming back!  Items we tried:  * Beef pad see ew $6.95 - Really juicy! We order this dish every single time we dine here and it's always delicious! They're very generous with the wide noodles. The sauce is an explosion of flavor, mixed with lots of Chinese broccoli, fluffy egg soaked in all of that tasty sauce and nice amount of tender beef. Everything is cooked expertly! Rated: 5/5  * Green curry chicken fried rice $7.95 - This is another dish we can't get enough of! A flavor bomb of deliciousness! The spices and green curry flavor comes through strong, very aromatic. There are long beans added for texture, bamboo shoots, basil, carrots and green bell pepper. We're always satisfied with the flavor of this dish! Rated: 5/5  * Panang avocado $8.95 - This is my first time trying avocado in of a warm curry and let me tell you, it works, very well! The perfectly ripe avocado is added like a garnish at the very end when serving, so it doesn't really get cooked. It adds such a wonderful silky and buttery texture to the curry! I'm a huge fan! Rated: 5/5   * Combo Appetizer sampler $8.95 - It comes with 1 eggroll, 2 crab Rangoon, 2 fried shrimp, 2 fried wonton, 2 chicken satay, 2 fried tofu. It's a good-sized starter for 2 people, maybe 3. I enjoy the Rangoon and also the fried tofu is fried to crispy perfection. I love their house made sauces that's served with the appetizer, there's a peanut and a sweet and sour sauce one; I want to dip everything in them! Rated: 3/5  * Papaya salad $6.50 - It's a traditional spicy and sour salad made from shredded unripe papaya mixed with long beans, tomato, toasted and crushed peanuts and served with a side of cabbage. You can pick your spice level when you order. The flavor was balanced and the spice level was perfect. I really loved their version, but I felt the portion was small. Rated: 4/5  * Pad ped snapper $8.95 (Thai curry stir fried with crispy red snapper mixed with bamboo, bell, young pepper seed, basil and baby corn) - The red snapper filets weren't too crispy and might be from the frozen section of the market, but the sauce is where it's at! The caramel sauce was packed with deep flavor, it was hard not to like this dish. I just wish they were more generous with the sauce, pouring it over rice was awesome! Rated: 3/5  * Pad Thai $6.95 - Their version here will do just fine, but it's not my favorite. I feel that the sauce is lacking much needed, bold tamarind flavor. Usually it tastes like it's missing something. Rated: 3/5  * S11 guay-teaiw-loard $8.25 (Chicken, shrimp, squid, tofu, mushroom, with black soy sauce served over steamed flat noodle and bean sprouts)  - The wide noodles are always a favorite, but the salty and sweet soy gravy was very potent and almost killed the palate. There was a prominent ginger aroma and flavor throughout the dish. However, the overwhelming amount of bean sprouts and the protein was unidentifiable, making this dish unexciting. Rated: 2/5  *PRO TIP* add fried or soft tofu to any of these dishes to add some more protein and another dimension of texture! So good!",

To be honest it kind of took me a while to find something that I liked here.   I usually love Red Curry, but their version doesn't suit me.  But seriously the pot stickers are pretty spectacular.    Update:  We just ordered the pot stickers again.  I guess you can also get them in a not vegan option.  However, I am not willing to chance it, as the vegan ones are so absolutely delicious.

I say that because i go to school in Reno, anyway that's a little irrelevant.  This place is pretty small, but the quality is great and also authentic. Some of the dishes i have had were pad Thai, curry, papaya salad, duck fried rice crab fried rice and basil leave fried rice, also chicken satay. Let me tell you, they did not at all disappointing me! Especially all the types of fried rice, you have to try all of them. My personal favorite is tied between duck fried rice and basil leave fried rice. Always super tasty and just... pure goodness.   I got some today and i ordered level 6 spicy. Honestly i thought it was a little bit too spicy. I don't like it when i have to stop eating something due to the spiciness. because then all i taste is the spicy and not the food. SO maybe a 5 would've been great.   But it was really delicious and the price is affordable. They are also super fast at take out! (of course i only ordered 2 dishes) but yeah, i definitely recommend this place.",

My soup came with like barely any broth and I just asked for some more. I mean I did order soup after all. Not noodles with duck thrown on it which is pretty much what it looked like. She told me that she doesn't do that here. I was confused and asked why and showed her that there was barely any broth and she didn't care and walked away. So I just poored my water in it which didn't help much. My bfs curry was really bland these people just seem like they don't give a crap about their customers.",

There's some parking on the street on Wynn Rd or you can park and walk over from the shopping complex.  The menu - listed all the traditional popular dishes. Noodles, soups, rice dishes, most of them offered with your choice of meat, tofu, shrimp, or duck. Didn't see anything that cost more than $8.95. Big score!  I ordered duck fried rice and papaya salad. The salad was OK, a small portion, nothing very spectacular. I guess since it cost only $5.95, I can't be disappointed. However, the duck fried rice - amazing! I ordered it since it got such great reviews. I can see why! You'll think it looks too saucy and salty, just dig in. I was pleasantly surprised to find lots of tender duck. This dish portion was huge!   For all you Thai Tea lovers, I saw the next table order a few, they were served in those huge pint glasses! The customers were very ecstatic when those drinks arrived!  The two girls serving their small room of tables were friendly and helpful. The prices are awesome, so I'm already looking forward to going back for their potstickers and duck pad thai!",

Literally.  Eating... chew, chew, chew... right now.    The shrimp fried rice is pretty flavorful as well.  No soy sauce or other crap is needed.  I got a fried egg on top.  Get that as well.  The egg yolk is the best sauce you can get.  Ever.  Ever ever.  We also ordered Tom Yum.  I haven't eaten that.  I'm still eating the duck curry.  I also have some edemame sitting here.  All in all, we spent $30 + $4 in tip.  For what amounts to 2 meals for 2 people, I don't see how this COULDN'T be a good deal.",

Probably THE best, I should say. The food is made fresh, homestyle. I've had different rice dishes, curries, tom yum, vegetables, and they're all sooooo good! If i ask for extra spicy, it doesn't really come out too spicy, but with the amount of love and flavor that's in the food, you won't need it. Coconut juice is way too sweet, though..I had to water it down 50% with water. Everything else was delicious and even the hard-to-please loved this place. On top of all of that, the customer service here is impeccable!  Thank you, Chinatown, for housing this little gem!",

    "text": "This is not your typical Thai-themed restaurant with the obligatory portrait of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, pictures or paintings of the Floating Market, major temples (Wat), hanging shadow puppets or classical Thai dancers or elephants.  This is a no frills Thai food restaurant, that is decorated with t-shirts sold to tourists visiting Thailand.  The food served here is not refined, but is delicious and comforting. I would describe it as the food one might expect to be served, when tagging along with their new college freshmen best dorm buddy (who is Thai, instead of the Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese ones I actually met back in college) going home for the weekend, with or without the nearly obligatory 2-weeks worth of laundry for mommy to wash.  The service here is excellent when we visited this past Sunday.  It wasn't too busy when we arrived, and the waitress took her time to recommend the various dishes in each section of the menu to try, plus the specials they have posted on the wall by the t-shirts.  I opted for the Chicken Khua-Kai Rice Noodles (even though I really wanted to try their Pad Se Ew) and the portion was decent, and it hits the spot. My friend ordered the Yellow Curry (I like the flavor of the curry and it wasn't too spicy and will probably try it on my own in a future visit).  We also shared the Fried Shrimp Rolls appetizer, that came out piping hot with the Thai Sweet Chilli Sauce, I didn't really care for this appetizer and will probably not try it again in the future.  Price-wise I was expecting it to be a little less, but I am sure their rent is not cheap, and they must charge enough to make it worthwhile to stay and run their business and continue to serve comforting Thai family cooking to locals and out of town guests.  My rating thus far is 3.6 stars (rounding up to a 4).  P.S.  Now that it is summer, I wonder if they have the traditional sticky rice with mango dessert?  Man I love those!",

We ordered three dishes for the four of us: chicken pad thai, beef noodle soup, and a dish with thick, flat noodles with eggs, meat and a little bit of veggies.  I requested the chicken pad thai to be spicy. She asked me \"how spicy on a scale of 1-10?\" I said 7. Fast forward 8 minutes later, my pad thai was NOT spicy AT ALL. =/ What the.... hmmm. So either they completely forgot about adding any spiciness to my dish OR a 7 is considered mild. Can someone clarify how this whole spicy rating works???? Is 1 super spicy or vice versa?  If I go to any thai restaurant, I gotta order either a thai iced tea or a thai iced coffee. My sister and I ordered a iced tea and iced coffee respectively.  Prices were pretty good. Our dishes were between $6-8 and our drinks were about $1.75 each.  Oh and one more thing, very small tight space. So if you're claustrophobic or you don't like sitting superclosetothetablenexttoyou, then I suggest going somewhere else.",

When I'm craving Thai, I go to this hole-in-the-wall tucked away in Chinatown Plaza. There's never a line and the food comes out expeditiously. There's actually four locations in Vegas and they even deliver. The menu has your basic curries, noodles, and rice dishes along with some chef's specials. Their Thai noodle soup is unique and the large chicken or seafood Tom Yum can serve even as an entree. Best of all, most, if not, all of their dishes are around $6-8, making for a much more affordable meal than Lotus. My one complaint from my last visit was their mango sweet sticky rice, which was less than par. The waitress warned me that the mango wasn't ripe and sweet quite yet, but the problem was with the very under cooked sticky rice. In any case, can't hate too much for a take-out restaurant.",

They are not for the faint of heart. Their Thai iced tea was also very good; every Thai restaurant makes it differently and I like the flavor of this one. The only reason that this restaurant gets 4 stars instead of 5 is how small the restaurant is. It was packed when we got there (it's very popular) so we had to wait outside for 20 minutes. I know that the wait is up to the customers eating there, but it was very hot outside. If you come outside of the lunch or dinner rush, I'm sure you will not have to wait.",

I stopped going until this week. I saw on Yelp (what a helpful little site) that they had closed in November for remodeling, so I was eager to check out the new digs.   It's True! They have new orange paint and new furniture! My butt was no longer hesitant to take a seat. The set-up is still the same, but paint and new furniture goes a long, long way.   I ordered one of my old time favorites: broccoli and tofu served in a brown gravy. I must say I was a bit saddened by the broccoli to tofu ratio. I finished all of the broccoli and still had a solid half cup of tofu left. But, it may be partly because the florets were so darn delicious I inhaled them like a vegetable vacuum.",

I ordered a Tom Yum Seafood Combination noodle soup and it wasn't what I expected. They added way too many tomatoes in the soup, it was very sour, the mushrooms aren't fresh and it was just not the best I've had. I don't think I'll be back at this location.",

They use Tomyum as the soup base which they barely dilute it for the noodle soup. Unlike other places where they always dilute the soup base and you don't even taste any favor, you are almost having a real Tomyum soup here. It comes with dinced pork, fish ball, shrimp, and fish cake etc. They were all perfectly cooked!   This time we also ordered the dumplings as an appetizer. They were ordinary but delicious! They put a bit of spicy mayonnaise on top (most likely siracha mixed with mayo) and that gives the perfect kick to the dish.   Asian food is known to be cheaper but this is extremely reasonably priced with very high quality. It deserves 6 stars!",

I got the Tom yum soup, pepper fried chicken wings, shrimp pad Thai, pineapple fried rice. Everything was so tasty except for the dessert I purchased the sweet rice and mango, the rice tasted raw and not cooked, the mango was sad and they had one slice cut in small pieces, not juicy and plump like in the photos, it made me sad.

    "text": "Very unassuming restaurant that is super, super authentic and SUPER, SUPER cheap. My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this restaurant because I was craving Thai boat noodles. The only time I've ever had Thai boat noodles was in LA and I could never find a restaurant that had it when I lived in Colorado. When I saw that Vegas Noodle House served it (called the Combination Beef Ball Noodle Soup), I was so excited and boy, it did not disappoint! The broth is so rich. It is a slightly sweet beef broth traditionally thickened with blood - sounds super weird, but it's SO good. The noodles are the same as pho noodles and overall just a very comforting, hearty dish. We tried their appetizer sampler as well. The appetizers weren't super memorable, but I honestly didn't care because I liked the noodle soup so much lol. Their thai tea is also really good - definitely not too sweet and really affordable. I'm excited to try other things on their menu!",

Don't pass this place up just because it's in a strip mall, it's seriously a hidden gem who shines mega brightly!",

Pros: - much cheaper than other Thai places. - it's a lot of food. - after 8 years of going here, nothing much has changed about the quality or menu, which i appreciate.  Cons: - service can be iffy. they're usually nice, but sometimes forgetful. nothing outstanding, but nothing horribly bad either. that's why i'm not giving this place 5 stars. - good luck finding parking.  overall, i really think its worth a try. it's been around for many years now, and for good reason too. :)",

On first glance it was obvious that the noodles were a bit unevenly dressed, based on the clearness of some noodles and the dark brown of others, so I was mixing it around myself for a bit to get it a little more even. I also just had two pieces of shrimp - that were both overcooked - but plenty of chicken. The plate was flavorful but extremely greasy. My friend got the Thai Spicy Noodles (probably their equivalent of the pad kee mao) and she said it tasted mostly like the Chinese hot sauce. My other friend did enjoy her pad see ew with pork and they were generous with the pork and veggies.",

It took about 15min for our food to come out.   We got an order of the Thai tea. It wasn't overly sweet and it was good. It's not out of this world but better than other places I've had it at. We got the beef noodle soup with egg noodles. You had a choice to choose between 4 types of noodles. The broth was very flavorful and the egg noodles were good. The meet was soft and not dry. It was a fairly big bowl and matched the price. We also ordered the fried chicken over fried rice. The fried chicken was cooked very well and the fried rice was great.  One thing that did bug me was when we didn't write the tip on the bill when we signed one of the girls asked my girlfriend whom came straight out of the bathroom,\"you're going to leave tip on the table, right?\" or something along those lines. We of course had full intention to leave tip, but that left a sour taste for you our experience. Ended up leaving $2 for that.",

Since I have been to Volcano before, they are really good if you ask me. The place is small, walked in looked @ the menu, and decided on the larb beef salad. Total with tax was 7.55. I had Larb Salad before @ this place in Austin Tx. and it was to die for. but this salad was pretty small for 7$, and very plane tasting. It had a decent size of meat in there compared to the rest of the salad but for 7$ they could ad more veggies @ least. Veggies aren't that expensive, and put better dressing or something. I doubt I will be back here. Total loss 8.55 cause I tipped the waiter. They waiter filled my water, n it's not his fault the food sucks. The people there where decently nice. IDK maybe I'm just a picky eater compared to the rest of Vegas, in my opinion good food in VEgas is VERY hard to find unless your spending 50$ @ a fancy casino buffet. Which is why I usually cook @ home cause I can't find what I want else where. Austin Tx. and Los Angles have much better food. Good thing I am moving to LA June 1st.",

We were crying and couldn't even finish the dish, but then again we are little white pussies. But kudos to this place for giving it to us as we'd asked. I'm all for getting an authentic eating experience in exchange for 20 minutes of shitting fire. It's a fair trade in my opinion. Isn't that why God invented ass cream?",

This time we had Three Companion (grilled chicken with sticky rice and papaya salad on the side), and fried chicken over fried rice, and more pad thai.  I didn't care for the sticky rice, but the grilled chicken was delicious.  High marks for the fried chicken over fried rice as well.  As a bonus, on the to-go menu, there is a coupon for free appetizer combo (egg rolls, fried wonton, and fried tofu) for purchase over $20.  They are not very good, but hey... they are free!

When I tried the sweet sticky rice, it was so freaken hard to chew and swallow (Trust me, I have ordered sweet sticky rice from plenty of place).  My bf also tried it and agreed that he has never ate sweet sticky rice this hard.  It tasted like raw uncooked rice where it is so darn hard and don't even think about chewing it.  You have to swallowed it whole. That was not it!  When i told my waiter about how the sweet sticky rice was so hard, she gave me an attitude and snapped at me with \"YES IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE HARD\".   i was baffled by her rudeness! WTH?  I am not THAI but i have had sweet sticky rice too many time to know that is suppose to be chewable and consumable and soft.  OMG.  I was very disappointed in both the food quality and service.

Curry with shrimp and avocado was good too, but with the avocado was too much. Curry with shrimp alone is good enough. Chicken satay with peanut sauce was pretty tasty.    We go there everytime whenever we go to vegas. Highly recommend.   Service is slow sometime because they have to cook all the dishes from one table, then move to the next table. Just wait patiently",

Pad Thai Exactly what you'd expect... a plate full of delicious tangy, sweet and sour noodles (spiciness to your liking, of course) with an abundance of chicken, bean sprouts, and of course, FLAVOR!  2. Tom Ka Khai (Coconut sour soup) Definitely recommended if you're... ya know. hung over. Really great flavor and very comforting.  3. Fried chicken slices over fried rice Oh my gawd. I know my friend chicken, and this fried chicken was breaded and fried to perfection. I was SUPER full when I took my first bite of this, and I simply could not stop.  Whether you're a local or a tourist like me, I highly recommend this place!",

Being small, I am mindful to come between prime time meal rushes to avoid a wait. The servers have come to know me, and I believe in the last two years I have only seen the same two girls! The tables can be very close so it is not the place for an intimate conversation, and close enough where I become friends with a neighboring diner!!!  I love their noodle dishes, however at the suggestion of a young Thai woman (my neighbor dining friend\" suggested I try the Salmon Avocado Panang Curry with a heat of 8 and I am in LOVE! I cannot get enough of it! The combination of flavors, and the fat textures of the coconut cream and avocado with chili oil to cut it is a pairing made in heaven.  Happy Eating DMW",

Everything they make taste delicious and people who work there are much nicer than most of the Asian restaurant in Vegas.   I usually go there and have their #38. I don't know the name because I eat it so much the people there start making it right away when I enter the door. My second favorite dish would be their beef noodle soup with flat noodles. It's a normal dish but it's amazing. I also liked their Fried rice with duck and vegetable soup (with or without noddle) if i feel like something light or if i have cold.  The place is a bit small for a group that's over 4 people, but who cares, this place is amazing.   btw, they just renovated the restaurant a few month ago. It looks the same to me but I appreciate the effort@!! ha",

We always determine a Thai restaurant's worthiness by tasting it's papaya salad. So we ordered that, pad thai, and green curry beef.  Papaya salad was very good, right away I was impressed. It had the perfect balance of sweetness and tarness. It wasn't too light or salty. Just a perfect little plate of salad.  After the papaya salad, I havd a very high expectation from the rest of food which took a while to get. We sat and watched customers get turn away and waited. It's a small kitchen! Give them a break!!  Pad thai was pretty good, a little sticky. All the noodles got stuck together, but that shows the noodle was not cooked with two cups of oil.  Green curry was only reason I deduct a star from the rating. It was a little salty and I did not find it tasty at all. I mean, curry should taste complex and rich, but this one did not have either character.  I would definitely go back and maybe become a regular.........also the service was super friendly.",

Also their fried rice dishes are spicy so if this place doesn't warm you up, then oh well. The roasted duck noodle was quite good and tasted different than other broths. I like different things so this was a very nice change of pace for me.  The chicken noodle soups are so perfect for combating a cold. You get a good amount of food for a decent price, which makes it an excellent value.  It's somewhat small inside, so be ready for that. Maybe avoid peak hours. And if it matters, there are actual Thai people working here. For some reason I like watching them take down my order in Thai.  Anyways, give it a try. It's different than the somewhat boring Japanese ramen places (those are bold words coming out of MY mouth). Different is good!",

No Maitre D, no fancy ceremonial, just great food. Pad See Ew remains my favorite, Spicy Eggplant is great too, and the soups are amazing! Last but not least, you gotta try the Sticky Rice with ice cream dessert.",

    "text": "I come here pretty often because the location is so convenient and I work just right around the corner as well. Like anyone who likes thai food and is rather basic lol, I always get the pad thai with steamed tofu. Prices are super reasonable (entrees ranging from $6.95-8.95) and portion sizes are big as well. Their serving sizes can feed about two people but I definitely recommend doing family style and just ordering a lot of entrees and sharing. There's so much to order so you can't go wrong there. Other than pad thai, I usually get their green and yellow curry with either chicken or pork and brown rice. Most of their dishes give you the option of your choice of protein which can range from shrimp, chicken, pork, steamed/fried tofu, beef. I like their pad see ew but it can be a little too salty but it's been different everytime I've ordered it. If you're sick, I definitely recommend their Tom Kha or their silver noodle soup which is a bit simpler but still good. Their thai tea isn't overbearing (too sweet) compared to boba shops.   Only huge downside to this place is that the workers here can be pretty rude or come off really cold and mean. It's honestly just a hit or miss though. A couple ladies that work there have been sweet and provide really good service but most of the time, they are pretty rude and give you attitude. I wasn't sure if I was the only one who noticed it but a couple of my friends who ordered pick up and dined in found the workers to be rude too. That's the only downside I can think of. It's not something they can exactly control but it sort of just kills the mood when you're trying to enjoy the food and ruins the atmosphere a little. Food is on point and the interior is pretty small and cozy but there's nothing wrong with that. Overall, a great place for authentic thai food for affordable prices!",

Careful on how much spice (hotness) you order. Their scale is 1 to 10, and I'm always careful when trying new places. I ordered Mongolian chicken with a hotness of 4 and it had a nice sting. Couple next to me was each enjoying a LARGE bowl of soup and it looked awesome. Looked like Pho with huge pieces of meat and veggies. I'm sure I would enjoy everything on their menu and look forward to my next visit.",

I didn't have to wait for a table but a lot of people that came afterwards had to wait about 10 min for one to clear up, so if it's during peak meal time, don't be in a hurry if you decide to stop by!   I've been craving pad thai all week and decided to try theirs because of their name - Thai Style Noodle House. The noodles were good, a little thinner than I'm used to but delicious with a nice sweet flavor and were served with a side of raw/fresh bean sprouts which were a nice compliment to the noodles. The pad thai w/ pork was super cheap at $6.95! Wow, what a deal! I will definitely be coming back for more pad thai as well as to try some of their other dishes when I have more time!  Service was ok because they were so busy it seemed like the 2 waitresses were overwhelmed most of the time I was there. At the end I wanted to leave so I ended up just handing them 10 bucks as I was starting to get up to go, even though I hadn't gotten my bill yet. Again, don't come here if you're in a hurry...did I cover that enough in this review?",

They use the cheapest/inexpensive quality of meats and its really visible and tasteless.   I always love to have Thai ice tea in every Thai restaurant I visit, and that wasn't even a great taste. I had to request a different drink something that didn't taste like soap :( yes my ice tea tasted like soap! 0:  The customer service was not really good. I wish they would be more helpful in recommending dishes and so on. Anyhow I have an idea of what I wanted but they didn't provide most of the Thai dishes so, I had to order similar ones that didn't come close to taste nor the look of it all.    Not a fan :/",

First , upon entry I noticed the very loud tv blaring a Vietnamese show. In addition to that noise were some employees on a lunch break talking very loud to the working employee. I still thought I'll see if the food was any good.. It took a while to get my order in as the waitress was busy socializing with her fellow co workers. Ummm, not okay. I ordered vegan potstickers (which came out with mayo all over them), sent them back to get another order which was dry outside and greasy inside, and the silver noodle salad. The salad was decent, but not worth the high volume noise of blaring tv, chatty employees, and crummy service I experienced. Definitely will not return here ever, as I'll be sticking with Veggie Delight next door!",

My family and I were on a trip to the Grand Canyon and decided to make a pit stop in Vegas (it just seemed like the sensible thing to do, of course). Having been on the road for 5 hours that day, we refused to settle for any Chipotle or other fast-food restaurant, but we weren't in the mood to drop big bucks at a Vegas buffet. Yelp came to the rescue, and we found this gem of a restaurant in Chinatown! First of all - SO MANY OPTIONS! It took us a while to figure out what we wanted. We decided on the the yellow curry, green curry friend rice, thai spice noodles, and red curry, all of which were exquisite! It was truly addicting, with not a spice out of place. The hospitality was great, and our waiter was keen to give her recommendations and craft her suggestions based on our dietary restrictions. When we got the bill, we were shocked at how unbelievably reasonable the whole meal was. Trust me - this is one Vegas decision you will not regret!",

Their menu is actually a mix between Chinese and Thai food.    It was really disappointing to open the menu and see things like Orange Chicken on the menu.  Really?  Really?!  They don't even have basic Thai appetizers such as angel wings or fish patties.  We were actually debating to leave the place without ordering because it did not have a lot of Thai dishes, but the employees were too nice so I decided to stay.  We ordered two dishes (because there really wasn't anything else on the menu that sounded Thai, nor appetizing) -- Boat Noodle Soup and Chicken Basil.  The noodle soup had a good flavor, but they did DUMB IT DOWN BIG TIME for vegas locals.  They did NOT have the pork rinds, blood, lliver, and tripe that a boat noodle soup usually has.  The broth was really sweet too, which was overpowering until I added my own chili flakes to balance the flavors.    The chicken basil was ok tasting, but wasn't great.  The place definitely dumbed down the spice factor too -- considering we requested \"medium\" for both dishes, the dishes were NOT spicy at all.  Again, I think this place is catering towards a clientele that can't handle much spicy food nor distinguish between Chinese and Thai food.   My bf pointed out their water is filtered, which is a good thing, and that they \"flavor\" their water with slices of lemons and oranges in the water pitcher.  Just fyi for those picky water drinkers out there.  This also tells me that their soups, most likely, have a better taste because the water is filtered.

There were 4 of us and 3 companions had the pad thai (different variations from tofu, shrimp and chicken) and all were very good! The noodle Tom Yum soup was also very good.  Came out piping hot  and has the good sweet and sour flavor you expect from a Tom Yum.  I had the chicken thai basil with brown rice and it was very flavorful and good portion size.  At around $6-7 per plate this was a bargain find and cannot wait to go back!",

Met up a with a group of fellow yelpers for a meal before a UYE. Having come late i had to ask for a set of dining ware and plates as well as a beverage. Another from our party arrive late and again we had to ask for the starting setup, then the last came and again we had to ask for the initial setup.   I couldnt identify the dishes ordered by the advanced party so i wont consider them in this review.  The pad thai was sub par, didnt include enough peanuts nor was it arranged traditionally with the bean sprouts on top. Lime wedges werent included. Taste was alright but on the bland side. Plenty of prawns but light on the taste.  The panang curry was a huge disappointment for me. the taste was very light and didnt have much of a curry taste. Had a lot of chicken but very little of anything else. Would have liked more bell peppers and bamboo shoots or anything.  Seeing as everyone reviews highly so i intend on coming back in attempt to experience the hype.",

We were in the mood for some asian food so figured we couldn't go wrong with this place seeing that it had 4 1/2 stars from 69 reviewers.    I had the Roasted Duck Noodle Soup, my friends had a Combo Beef Noodle Soup and Chicken and Shrimp Silver Noodles.  For an appetizer we had Fried Tofu and we each had Iced Coffee.  The Iced Coffee was probably the best part of the meal (unfortunately).  The Fried Tofu was just ok...had much better from other places,  It was a little hard and not smooth and soft.  My Roasted Duck Noodle Soup was ok...tasted like it had a lot of MSG in it though.  My other friend said his Combo Beef Noodle Soup was ok, but it didn't have enough beef.  And my second friend was a bit disappointed with his meal...the chicken was kind of bland and the dish itself wasn't too flavorful.  So overall, the meal wasn't bad...just not great.  I've had better Thai food but probably have had worse too.  Staff was friendly and polite though.",

He told me that he wanted to take me to his secret Thai restaurant that he thinks is bombb, but doesn't know the name of it because it doesn't have a sign on the door. After I parked and walked up to it, I was like oh duh, Thai Style Noodle House and jumped on Yelp to see what I should get. First off, I recall people mentioning that they may not give lunch menus unless you ask, so we sat down & searched for the lunch menu, but it was nowhere to be found. I ask the waitress & boom, out comes the lunch menu. I think it's $5.50 for 1 entree & $7.something for 2.   When my friend orders, she asked him what level spiciness 1-10, but I was still debating if I should go healthy and get a salad or order some yummy lunch specials. It took me awhile to order & the waitress asked me instead if I want mild, medium, or hot for my spicy eggplant with beef and green curry with chicken. I thought that was weird, but I got hot (whatever that means). Lunch specials also come with a choice of eggroll or fried tofu & a little salad. We got home & dug in. The spicy eggplant was nothing special and the green curry was not as basil-y as others I've tried. The vegetables in the green curry were kind of funky, as in, they weren't very bountiful or filling and I have no idea what anything else was other than the green beans (even those I'm uncertain of). Anyway, my other complaint is that \"hot\" was not hot. My 2 year old was digging in, and she's not one for super spicy foods. Overall, I'd say lunch specials are fair and the food was alright. I'd come back to try the noodles someday, if I'm in the area.",

    "text": "We've been frequenting the Thai Style Noodle House's Fort Apache location quite a bit lately, and I wasn't even sure if I had been to their Wynn location yet.  I looked all over for my review of the place confirming whether or not I had been, and lo and behold, I find it in my \"Unfinished Reviews\" section.  So, here it is...finally.  Thai Style Noodle House offers both Chinese and Thai food, but mostly Thai.  Our party of four ordered a few dishes to share so we could sample a bit of everything.  * Beef / Pork Jerky \"Beef / pork marinated in special Thai herb, dried in one sun and deep fried\" ($6.95) - We chose the beef option and the Husband is the real expert on this since he tends to get it a lot.  I found it to be just okay though, it was a bit too dry for me.  (Whereas other places make their variation a bit more moist.)  * Grill (Chicken, Pork, or Beef) Salad \"Your choice of sliced meat cooked with red and green onions, mint leaves, ground roasted rice, chili, and lime dressing.\" ($6.95) - We chose the beef option and the Husband loved it.  I thought it was just okay and lacked something - a bit more sauce and zest would have been nice.  Then again, this is something that the Husband has had a lot of.  * Roasted Duck Noodle Soup \"Noodle with boneless sliced roasted duck and Yao Choy in Thai herb duck broth.\" ($6.95) - This wasn't my top choice to order, and it was just okay.  There was nothing special about the roast duck at all.  * Pad See-eu \"Stir fried flat rice noodle and egg, Chinese broccoli in sweet black soy sauce.\" ($6.75) - This was okay with chicken and greens, although it was a bit flat.  * Red Curry \"Thai red curry with your choice of chicken, pork, beef mixed with bell pepper, bamboo shoot and basil served over steamed rice.\" ($6.75) - We chose vegetarian with soft tofu and I'm always a big fan of Thai curries.  They didn't disappoint here - good flavor and spice.  This was the real winner for me and I definitely would be back to try out their other curries.  We also had Thai iced teas all around.  * Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice ($3.50)  * Fried Ice Cream ($3.50) - It had a nice crunchy batter with little ruby-like things in condense milk.  Things I do appreciate about Thai Style Noodle House is that there are a lot of vegan and vegetarian choices, and they don't charge for brown rice.  I also like when they offer you a choice on the tofu - soft or fried.  Service - it was busy the evening we went and with one waitress, she was kept on her toes.  She was friendly and on the top of her game, but then again, Bobby Y. (a regular) was dining with us.  So I think that may have helped us there.  3.5 stars  (I'm confident that I would give them a four star if I go back and try out their other curry dishes.  But since I've been having them at their Fort Apache location, I can definitely say their curries are yum!)",

    "text": "My first visit here and although I am not blown away by what I had, it was good enough to warrant another visit.  Although there were plenty of lunch time patrons at this place, the food was still served pretty fast.  I ordered the Thai Style Tom Yum noodle soup with rice vermicelli only because my wife said the Tom Yum was good.  I don't really care for Tom Yum flavour and the rice vermicelli.  I don't think it was a good combination with this type of soup.  So I guess I was a little disappointed with this dish.  I also tried to order their duck fried rice, but to my dismay, they ran out of duck, so I had to settle for the crab fried rice instead.  The fried rice did have real crab meat in it, but there weren't that many pieces and the flavour of the crab was not infused into the fried rice, so again I was disappointed.  But then I saw the table next to me was eating the rad na with what looked like wonton noodles and it looked good.  So on a separate occasion, I ordered the rad na to take out.  Now this dish was quite flavourful. Redemption!!  There was just the right amount of gravy in there and although the greens turned a little yellow by the time I got home to eat it, the texture of the gai lan was still good.  I will definitely go back and try some of their other dishes, namely their curries.",

I have been looking for some good Thai food, so I decided I would try this place out after reading a lot of the stellar reviews on it.   I will dare say that this place is the next best thing to eating in Thailand, & I know because I have been there more than a few times ;)   I had the chicken noodle soup with a combo of flat & egg noodles, which is just as good as you can get from the best street vendors in Thailand! The broth was definitely very flavorful & they give you all the great condiments to go with it. The sliced peppers in vinegar are awesome! However, it could have used a little more sprouts, cilantro & green onions in the soup. That would be my only request :)   That is the best part about the street vendors, everything on their carts are fresh & plentiful & you can add as much & whatever you like & as many noodle combinations as you want in your soup.   My date du jour had the pineapple fried rice & from the look on her face & her comments, she really enjoyed it. After we finished the main course, we decided to split the fried bananas with ice cream & drizzled with honey. WOW!! That delicious little dish is what earned that 5th star :D   I also ordered some pork chow mein to take home with me, cuz I gots to have my noodles! I F**K's with them noodles! I F**K's with them hard!! I have to say, it wasn't bad.   Overall, I would totally recommend this place. The seating is pretty limited & close enough quarters that you can hear every ones conversations :P The decor is almost nonexistent, but who cares, it's a great little spot to enjoy some great food. The wait staff is outstanding in my opinion, very pleasant & helpful. I will definitely be a regular at this place & will not mind the 15-20 minute drive whatsoever ;)",

The taste of the curry with the hot spices weren't salty and that's what I found in some Thai restaurants. I did wish I would've eaten there as the restaurant had that local feeling to it. I imagine that's what one of the restaurants look like in Thailand, small and cozy.   My bf ordered the BBQ Chicken over Fried Rice. He was very impressed with this dish, from the presentation to the flavors that married together. The charred taste of the chicken was also what made his taste buds happy.   As a third dish, we ordered their pad Thai. I don't think I would order this again. Maybe I just am not a fan of pad Thai but I have had a better version of it. There was just something about the taste that didn't quite agree with my pallet.",

    "text": "I've officially found a Thai restaurant for every occasion ! I'm done trying new places, my Thai list is complete !  Komol: Homey, good for dinner with friends, nice atmosphere Archi's: Americanized style stuff Thai Style Noodle House: The perfect affordable lunch spot Lotus of Siam: Gourmet all the way !!  Comparing this place to Lotus is comparing apples to oranges. Ok, so they are both Thai but this is like comparing In n Out to the $20 ribeye burger at Bradley Ogden. For some of the best Thai food in the United States - try Lotus (think James Beard nomination! If you don't know what James Beard is, don't waste the time/money to dine at Lotus). For a great hole in the wall spot that won't let you down, Thai Noodle House is fabulous !  Thai Iced Tea : The best rendition I've ever had. At $1.99, a killer deal.  Duck Curry: A bit thin for my taste, but the duck was high quality and really yummy !!  Fried rice with Chinese Sausage + bbq pork: well I guess this is more Chinese (they do call themselves Thai + Chinese after all), but regardless, it was delish  PANANG CURRY WITH AVOCADO: This probably isn't authentic.. at all.. but WOW best curry I've had in my life. Honestly. I would put this up against tri color curry from mix zone any day. I will eat here over and over again for this freaking magical stuff ! Creamy, thick, delicious. Now that I've had it I think all curry should come with avocado!!  In conclusion, this is that hole in the wall Thai place you've been on that quest to find in Vegas. Affordable, well executed, and some creative items I've never seen before ! I would never pit it against Lotus of Siam, but for what it is - it's awesome !",

I usually order from  krung thai as i do eat a lot of thai food and they are my favorite for delivery but i wad teying to branch out and try something new. The panang was poor, very greasy and thinned out sauce. The chow mein wasn't actually chow meinbut instead they gave me lo mein. If any of you eat thai enough you will understand the difference between these two dishes. When i received the delivery the driver said i owed and the receipt didnt show a credit charge even though i had been sure i paid with my card. Since there was no charge receipt i trusted that it didnt go through so i paid in cash. Upon going back to my house (he also pulled up to the wrong house two streets over and i had to go find him) i saw that my card had in fact been charged and the delivery driver just walked away with my cash for a meal i had already paid for. Needless to say im not happy with this experience and the only reason they got 2 stars is because their delivery time is prompt 30 minutes flat",

The first thing you notice when you walk in us that is smells like bad breath! Eeeew! Should have been our first red flag!  We were a party of four on a Thursday afternoon and the place is small and crowded. Waited for a hostess to seat us and was told 10 minutes to wait for a table when they clearly had a clean table for four ready in the back corner. It was very awkward standing in the doorway as people came in and others left. A waitress gave us menus to look at while we stood in the entry way. About the same time a single man (who came in after us) was seated at the table for four that I mentioned earlier. WTF. Really?!?!   We waited and were finally seated. The menu was greasy and had lots of misprints and old prices scribbled out with new prices written in. Not very professional or appetizing.   The waitress was rude, slow and acted like our request for a side dish and chop sticks was a big inconvenience. The food was basic and boring. No real flavor. Who the hell serves mayonnaise on potstickers??? The Pad Thai was a small portion and half of my plate was just a huge handful of bean sprouts. The dish does not come with rice here, like it does in every other Thai restaurant in the world. Skimpy.   I do not recommend this place to anyone based off of my experience today. We won't be back. So many other places nearby that truly respect their customers and deserve repeat business! Yuck!",

The places are outside the perimeter.  Don't be fooled by this hole in the wall -- this is not only great food, but specifically great Thai food at any price.

But from this day forth, I no longer want to go.   I ordered this combination of papaya salad with sticky rice and fried pork on the side. When I received this, I noticed many tiny bugs all around it. And because, like I've said I'm a civil person, I did not make much noise and said it quietly to the waiters (might I add THE WORST customer service Ever) pointing towards the plate which as they also noticed and hurriedly took the plate away. As I wait for another 10 minutes for this plate to return we expected them to treat us with nice service considering they could have been sued for this. My friend asked if she could at LEAST considering what happened and asked for a refill of her thai tea and the waiter gives her the dirtiest look and says \"we dont give refills\". Basically, in the end we asked for our check and calculated the total cost and noticed there was NO changes made in our bill. We were given the full price. Never have I been more disappointed. But this is not the only incident that has happened to me at this location. The last time I went there were lipstick stains on my cup which I had not worn any lipstick at the time clearly stating that i definitely did not take a sip out of the cup nor did they wash the cup. but I've let that go. Until this incident.  The most inexpensive thai restaurant but now I see you get what you pay for.  The less you pay, the less the quality PLUS a bonus of insects. ;) Good luck to those who try this place out in the near future.  They were lucky it weren't someone else who would've said it out loud reacting harshly towards a situation like this.",

Annnnnnd, it came out to about $32 total. WHAT A STEAL!!  We ordered the following:  Tom Young Soup: Not a big fan, but friend said it was very good! I tried a taste of it for the first time and it wasn't for me. It did have a good balance of sour and not sour though.   Crab Fried Rice: Really good. Trust me on this one! I will order this one again. If you like dry fried rice instead of sticky this is for you.   Spicy Flat Noodles: It was I expected, but very good! Flat noodles are by far my favorite kind of noodle.  Duck Fried Rice: I wanted to soooo badly love this dish, but it was just too sweet for me. It was cooked with pineapple, and the duck they added was fatty. By no means does fatty mean bad, but it's not for everyone. Wouldn't order this one again.   Overall, I would go back for a bite to eat. Can't beat price, food, and atmosphere. Will have to show my parents when the come visit. :)",

Even though the prices are a lot cheaper than the rest of the Thai places, the quality was a bit disappointing. I ordered Papaya Salad, Pad See Ew, and Chicken Tom Yum. Papaya Salad was average, if not satisfactory. I did like the Tom Yum although it was a bit too sweet. The disappointment finally came when I tried the Pad See Ew. It was too salty, no real sauce flavor and pretty boring.   For the price of around 6-7, you can't really complain, but when it comes to my beloved Thai food, I'm willing to pay a few bucks more for better taste....",

    "text": "Every trip to Vegas should involve a stop at this place. Buffets are great for dinner or breakfast, but for that other meal of the day or when you are worn out from exclusively eating the priciest food items to recoup buffet cost, this is the place to hit up.  Finding the location is a little tough and parking can be even tougher during noon time, so aim to eat a little off the rush time. The parking lot on that strip is also rather cut throat, so expect some near misses. The seating is also limited so expect to stand outside if you have a large party or during a meal rush. The interior is not lavish by any means, but it seemed to be somewhat upgraded the last time I went.   Our favorites include the green papaya salad, tom yum soup, duck noodle soup, and any of the noodle dishes. One fun highlight is that noodle dishes can be made with duck meat, which is not a feature you'll find at many other places. The restaurant leery Chinese in-laws manage to down a large quantity of food here, which says a lot. As others have advised, this place takes requests for the food to be spicy seriously. If you are borderline in how much you enjoy mouth burning, go down one level from what you would request at other places for your first visit.   There are Chinese menu items, but we haven't tried any of them. Really I don't see a need for these items since the Thai is so good, but they might make someone who is Thai averse comfortable eating here.   As a side tip, for Vegas people on a budget, after eating here walk down the strip and you'll find a bakery to buy Asian style breakfast buns for the next day.",

Going into the place I knew beforehand it was kind of a hole in the wall kinda joint...small and cozy, it was about what I had expected...about room enough to hold 25-30ish peeps at a time betwen different 2 seaters, 4 seaters, that could be pushed together to hold more (like a 10group that was chowing down as we entered)...1st things that hit me were the smell, and I automatically saw how big the soup bowls were from the 10group...YUM!!!....My mouth had allready started watering!!!  HAHA  Started looking at the Trifold menu...and my sillyass spread my arms out wide, put my hands across everyones menu's n was like....I don't care what we get...DUDE!!!...whats the name of the cocunut spicy soup cuz we are SO getting that!!!...(Tom Kha)...Mmmmmm!!!  Between the 3 of us we had a Huge Bowl of Tom Kha (medium), Duck Fried Rice, Pad Thai, and Mongolian Beef w/ Rice... (all for $35 w/ tip mind you!!!....)  Before I start all I am going to caveat with is the fact that we ate around 6...it is 1am and I just woke from my Food Coma!!!  Portions were Big!!!  Usually I like everything spicy spicy!...we order the Tom Kha medium, and it was a perfect blend of keeping all the flavor without being overpowered...Medium is a good hoice is someone can't handle spicy well as was in our case, De-Ri-Cious!!! The Duck Fried rice was over the top...again great portion size and you could see the large cuts of duck in there, YUMMM!!! Pad Thai (combo)...portion size was a lil smaller then the previous 2 but totally adequete...great taste Not gonna lie, Mongolian Beef was tasty, but nothing to rave about like the previous ones...  ok, without even meaning to I totally just listed those in order from: Totally Yummy!!!...to...it was allright...haha!  Forgot to mention the service, service was quick and the waitress didn't lollygag at welcoming us or taking our orders!  Water glasses were allways filled...and trust me we were sucking it down (so to speak) after a day in the sun.  I know next time I will totally have to order the Thai Tea.....you could see these large, almost beer mug looking tea's being passed around, but yea....I was totally craving water at that point, LOL  So overall, food wise, 5 STARS!!!....I ALMOST took it down a star, cuz yea if your looking for the ambiance and the cheeze of chinatown this may not be your spot, go into it knowing it's a holeinthewall, but with that also comes the best food and the best service!!!  Hell I hear during lunchtime it's packed so that has to speak volumes right...and plus for all that food it was only $30 +tip!!!  (AWESOME prices, totally took it back up to 5 stars!)  Too far from my work to make it for lunch, but if you ever see a guy in late afternoon/night wearing a uniform, know thats me coming home from Nellis craving some soul food to satisfy the tummy!!!    ^_^",

Not really worth the drive anymore unless I'm in the area. Even then, lunchtime I'll be going to Krung Siam Thai for their great lunch specials.",

At 7 I think it was very spicy and anything more than that may be inedible to the average consumer. The service was actually great they were very attentive and polite.  Please note, my fiance did not like the panang AT ALL. He said it tasted gritty from \"all the crushed spices\". I wholeheartedly disagree with that and continue to give it five stars, but the area that I will agree on is the mango sticky rice. Neither of us were huge fans of it here, but hey, it's not a huge deal.  For the price and the service this place is definitely worth a shot.",

This is my boyfriend's favorite Thai restaurant when basing the food for the value and at first I didn't like it too much.   But over time I've changed my mind because the food is always consistent.   I never have to worry that when I come in the fried rice will taste different or off.   There are some standout dishes that I think are great here.   The beef jerky is really good.   The fried chicken over fried rice is amazing.  I also really like the pumpkin yellow curry.   The ladies who work here are very nice as well.   They are patient and always smiling.   I never run out of water here.   The food also comes out very quick and nice and hot.  Very tasty and worth a trip in.",

I decided to try the Roasted Duck Soup, and it was spectacular. The broth was exactly what I needed. It was so tasty, warm and it definitely hit the spot. My partner had the Chicken Pad Thai which was incredible! And our friend ordered the Chicken Noodle Soup and he loved it! We were in and out In about the same time we would have been in line at the other place!  The best part was the soup was so big we each had to take two containers of it home!   Long story short, you need to try this place!",

The duck fried rice is large. It's great to share with friends! I love picking out the pinneapple and pieces of fatty duck. They've run out of it before so I recommend going early on the weekends. It's a hit or a miss sometimes though depending on who is cooking in the back. Sometimes we'll get a generous portion of duck in the rice and other times it's a bit light. Still tastes amazing though!   Pad Thai is also an excellent item to share. The portion size is pretty large in my opinion for what you pay for. Make sure you squeeze lime over it! Makes it tastes so much better.   Panang curry is not as large of a portion. Goes great with the fried rice or over white rice. The meat is always tender and fatty too!   Keep in mind, we do not come here for the service. They treat you like any other authentic, whole-in-the-wall Asian joint. However, the food always tastes great and is made fresh in the back.   Check in to get a FREE Thai Tea. Highly recommend getting the Thai tea. You can tell they make it fresh daily.   Overall, love Vegas Noodle House. This is the OG spot so go here first before visiting the one in Summerlin. Don't expect much with the service, but expect great food!   Happy Dining,  JT",

I ordered Pad See Ew with fried tofu, which was on the menu as a pan fried noodle dish, but when it came out it was a soup.  I don't have a real problem with this. However, I am a practicing vegetarian with vegan leanings. Yet, I still bend reluctantly.  After eating my meal, which was delicious, I could tell the broth was not vegetarian.  It was oily and most probably was chicken broth.  I asked one of the workers if it was vegetable or meat-based broth.  He did say that it was a meat-based broth.  Pretty sure the Thai Iced Tea was dairy too.  Oh well....  Great service, quaint space, very affordable, nice location for a low-key restaurant.  If you're not veggie, the food is actually really good. I had regrets but I did eat the food.  The next day I went next door to Veggie Delight.",

It was also not sour enough. Definitely pass on this dish.  Parking is terrible.

Felt like Bangkok without 98% humidity.  Unpretentious restaurant concentrated on the best Thai dishes and large portions. If you can finish it you may be auditioning for 600 lb life. They have great variety and flavor from no spice to why are my eyes bleeding level. You can go to other Thai places in a pinch but this should be your go to authentic Thai restaurant. No Americanized Thai food just good tasty food like hawker food in Chiang Mai, Bangkok, or Phuket without all the foo foo decor and fancy outfits that make you feel  like you are an extra on the set of The King and I and you're paying for. Go once ,,,if you're  too stuffy to like hole in the wall joints, go to the strip or Jugheads chain. Good food, great prices and good portions,,,,don't miss this place!!!! Try it once and you'll be back!!!",

Pair the meal with a Thai iced tea and you will not be disappointed. I cannot praise this Thai restaurant enough the food is truly delectable and the price point is perfect.

I love the location since I live right up the road and it's in between my commute to work and home.  I'm all about reasonable prices! My meal was under $10.  The portions were big... I ended up taking home half of my meal. I went around 9pm and my fellow yelp las vegas elite/friend and we were the only ones there... so seating and waiting for our order wasn't an issue.  Cute hole in the wall... casual indoor seating.  Only thing I wasn't a fan about was their angel hair noodles. Pad thai noodles are usually bigger in size. Taste was decent but I've had better pad thai here in Vegas.  Would I come back? sure! If not for the pad thai... I wanna try their thai fried rice with chicken (since pad thai and fried rice with chicken are my only thai things I like).  If you're in the area and craving thai... stop by TSNH!  -Miss Yelp 2011",

Located in a strip mall it's not a big place but it was crowded, small and cramped-but we were seated and greeted right away.    I ordered a Thai Iced Tea and it was made to perfection, cold and creamy without being warm or watery like other places.    We ordered an appetizer and had the fried shrimp and it was good.  A few pieces of battered shrimp perfect for the two of us.  I had a terrible cold and was in much need of a bowl of chicken noodle soup, thank goodness they had one on the menu.  A hot huge bowl with rice noodles, cilantro, chicken and broth came out. Waitress brought out some spices to add so I put in a few chili flakes.  My friend had a beef noodle bowl and she said it was very good. She was very happy with her order.  Overall it was ok, speedy, friendly service and convenient to the foot spa which we went to afterwards.  Lots of great noodle bowl choices on the menu.",

The Chinese broccoli with crispy pork (it's on the whiteboard menu) is a must try, along with the Fried rice with bbq pork and Chinese sausage. Everything else is fair game as well but those are the two items we always order. The Thai iced tea comes in two sizes, regular and x-large (x-large comes in a huge Styrofoam container) and although sweet, tastes great. Staff is very friendly as well.",

A place with \"Noodle House\" in their name is usually an indicator of an unauthentic Asian restaurant.  I walked in and immediately noticed that the servers were all Thai. Phew.  I read some pretty mixed reviews of the Pad Thai and honestly it's pretty good. A tad on the sweet side, but good and GENEROUSLY PORTIONED nonetheless. The noodles don't stick together unless you order it to go and let it sit out. I would definitely come back to try their other menu items! Plus, everything is so cheap, go give it a shot!",

Cheap doesn't necessarily equate to poor quality and this place is a perfect example.   I usually go for the house noodle which has a combination of minced pork, fish cake, and shrimp in a tom yum soup base and we'll complement it with a stir fried dish of sorts. Our group also had yellow curry and remarked how good it was as well.   Definite must try location if you're remotely interested in Thai food.",

There's other Thai in the area I usually hit up and if I want to eat at TSNH, there are other locations closer to home. It seemed they painted and it looks cleaner in here than what I remember.   We started with a appetizer of potstickers. It's standard potstickers, but good. They do a trio of sauces swirled on it, not the typical soy based sauce.   I got a rice plate of spicy thai basil with pork at a 6 level which wasn't that spicy so I doused it with hot sauce. I like my spicy, Thai level spicy and since I haven't been here in a while, I wanted to go middle of the road to gauge it. Still the flavor of it was good though.  Scott got red curry I believe with chicken and I took a bite and it was rather good. It was oddly more spicy than mine even though he got less spice level.  Service was decent enough. My water was refilled which is appreciated in this crazy heatwave.   For a appetizer, 2 entrees and a drink for $22, this is some cheap eats. Definitely the prices are great since most is about $7. I don't think the quality suffers from it either as both entrees had food flavor and a decent amount of food.",

These folks have the fix I need. Best appetizer I've had is the crisp squid. Not too battered and not too chewy. It has the right amount of crisp and bite. Great Papaya salad and pork w/sticky rice combo. The Red or Yellow curry is a must. And if you get the Pad See Eww. Make you sure you get the combo (all kinds of meat and shrimp) style. Be forewarned that if you order a level 10. On the spicy scale....you'll be sweating bullets! Lol",

ATMOSPHERE. it's kind of hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for. passed right by it because it's on the side of the strip mall. once inside, expect -super cramped- quarters. basically, you might be bumping elbows maneuvering your chopsticks with the patron next to you. hope you showered today.  CUISINE. hella goodness. hella goodness. i've only been once and didn't try to cram my face full of everything. everything we had was good though. when they say thai hot, they mean thai hot. it goes on a scale of 1-10. i imagine 10 means it chemically removes the roof of your mouth since 7 was so hot my friend was pouring out electrolytes.  PRICE. woah. it's unbelievably affordable. two dishes and a drink -- with a generous tip = $20. you can tell it's affordable. there are like... broke kids in there on dates -- not dutch either.  SERVICE. since the place has limited seating, the service is actually quite good. they're fast. you order; it shows up. you're practically sitting in the kitchen so they don't have far to go.  OVERALL. this is now one of two places that i MUST VISIT when in vegas, the other being ichiza (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/ichiza-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/ichiza-las-...</a>).",

Ordered the BBQ pork fried rice, glass noodle salad, pork and fish ball soup with vermicelli, and large Thai iced tea and large coconut juice for the misses.    First off the large drinks come in a large stein glass.  The size you should get since its so freaking hot out in the desert.  You will be hydrated once you finish the large drink.    The fried rice is soft and flavorful.  Not dry like other places.  Hight recommend you guy to try it out.  They don't skimp on the BBQ pork.  Glass noodle salad was spot on.  Had ground pork and shrimp mixed with romain lettuce, shredded carrots, red onions all mixed in the Thai lime juice.  A very colorful dish.  Lastly the pork and fish ball soup was very simple.  Sometimes it's tough to keep a dish simple, but the dish tasted very homemade.    Not too far away from the strip, plentiful parking, accepts credit cards, friendly service, great food at very wallet friendly prices.  5 stars easy.  Will go back again and I suggest you do the same.",

    "text": "I have had this place bookmarked for my last three trip to Vegas and I finally got here.  It is hard to find in the dark, even harder to park as it is on the street at the end of an industrial complex.  It is right across to the East from Chinatown Mall which also has parking problems during prime eating hours.  My initial attraction to this place was from reviews by a few of my friends.  When I checked in I was impressed to find Misti, the Vegas CM, is the Duchess of this place.  I chose a Thai iced tea to drink.  Even in my limited experience it was only OK but not great.  It got better from there.  As an appetizer I ordered shrimp rolls ($5.95) which were 6 large shrimp in a roll and deep fried with a peanut sauce.  For my entree I chose Rad-na with chicken.  It was very good but I feel I cheated myself of some flavor by ordering it mild rather than 3 or 4 on the spice scale.  It is definitely a hole in the wall with basic decor.  The service was really great and the two young women were on top of their game while still being able to kid around with the regulars, it is a very comfortable place to visit.   While I was there both a sit down customer and a take out customer mentioned they had driven past the second location to go there because they did not like the food there as well.  I am sure by the comments that they are trying very hard to make them indistinguishable,  I very much enjoyed my dinner here.",

The chairs were broken and the vinyl was torn on them. The table was sticky (THAT\"S THE WORST!), the staff were not friendly, and the food was only mediocre. Gosh I really wanted to like it!  One thing is that the seating area was so small that I was always feeling in the way and I couldn't relax and just eat. The tables are very close and some ladies were seated next to us and it felt like they were actually AT my table. That wouldn't be a big deal if they were nice people. They were very loud and speaking in a language that was not my own. They only would steal a few looks at us when they thought we weren't looking. It is natural to think that the people are talking about you, right? That's how I felt for some reason.  Avoid this place if possible. There are other places nearby that are better. Pho Kim Long for instance.",

My buddy and I were hoping to round out our Vegas trip with some good old fashion Roasted Duck Noodle Soup so we decided to give this place a shot.    To be fair, service was decent and I'd give the flavor of the soup a letter grade of a \"B\" but what I just couldn't get around was the ROACH that seemed to be lounging in my bowl.  Wow right?  Roast Roach Duck Noodle Soup!  Grossed out and not wanting to eat any longer, we notified the lead server and showed them my little hitchhiker roach and even though they apologized for the incident we decided to leave.    In retrospect, I'm glad I fished the little roach out before I got more than three spoonfuls of soup down.  The soup is a dark brown broth.  I didn't take the time sift through the rest of my soup but I wouldn't doubt it if there were more little buggers in there.",

    "text": "My first 1-star review...  for a place that received an average of 4-stars, and upon our visit had line waiting out the door.  Here is the chronology of what happened:  We initially went to Pam Real Thai just a mile over based on the review.  Looked really interesting, but alas, it was closed because they were only open for dinner.  So we looked up this place on Yelp and decided to head over.  First impression good, there were a couple of party waiting outside for a table for this small joint.  About 100 degrees outside so not too pleasant, but looking forward to the food.  We put our name in for 2, but there was a party of 9 in front that they said would need to be seated first.  No problem.  We wait about 10 minutes, and the big party goes in to get seated.  In the meantime there were a couple other small parties that came around, but we didn't pay attention too much.  Another big party of 8 comes, puts their name in, and waits.  10 minutes or so later, the party of 8 goes in!  I go inside to check out what's going on, and the small parties that came after us are also seated already!  So I go over to the counter and ask them when we were going to get seated, they look at the \"wait list\" and our name is still on it, with people below us crossed out!  What the heck?  They realize, say \"oh\", and says, \"sit over there\" and points to the empty table.  No apologies, just a point of a finger.  Man, food must be really good here to tolerate this, I thought.  We later witness that there is another party getting a similar treatment so notching this one as an inefficient system that has got to get fixed.  Service does not improve as the meal goes on, however.  We flag the server down to order our drinks and food, never got served water, and they never checked up on us for the meal.  Onto the meal.  We ordered a Thai Iced Tea, Thai Iced Coffee (no difference as Vietnamese one), Yellow Curry, and Spicy Fried Rice.  In general, everything was good.  But both the curry and rice was too salty.  The dishes were plain, no garnishments, and smaller in size to justify the cheaper price.  So not necessarily a bargain.  Tea was good, no complaints, coffee was typical.  So overall 3-stars for the meal.  If it wasn't so salty, the curry would have been great.  So throughout the meal, the servers never approached us, we called them EVERY TIME.  To order, to ask for anything, to ask for the check.  That gets a zero in my book and I let the tip speak for that.  I pay for the food, I tip for the service.  Servers should always remember that, I don't care what you get paid.  Table-for-1 Factor:  They had lone diners, so it is fine.  Whether they can accommodate you...",

    "text": "So I called this place for delivery while I was staying at the Rio.   I had visited Hoover Dam, had ziplined from the rooftops of the Rio, bought a wedding dress, and had been walking around and my feet hurt. Once I got to my room at 9:00pm, the last thing I wanted to do was go back to the valet to get my car, or walk around the strip to find a place to eat because that would have taken time and I would have been hungry, cranky, starving and grumpy at 10:00pm while walking/driving around aimlessly trying to find a restaurant.  Here comes yelp to save the day. At this point, I don't care who brings me food. There were some bad reviews but like I said, at this point in the evening, with hungry kids in the hotel room, who cares. So we placed our order over the phone and waited...  They only deliver to the front valet drop-off area probably because they don't want to take the time to park and navigate the hotel to find your room. That's understandable. The delivery guy called when he was 5 minutes away. We were already waiting downstairs but that was a nice gesture to make things run as efficiently as possible. We expected a guy to roll up and toss us the food through the window but he didn't do that. We were focused on the cars and didn't even spot him until we realized there's a guy standing on the sidewalk across from us holding bags of food.   We ordered the fried calamari, orange chicken with sauce on the side, wonton soup, wonton noodle soup, pad Thai, panang beef, crab fried rice, and extra steamed rice. The portions were generous, prices were reasonable, quality and taste were average. It was exactly an hour when the food arrived. I timed the exact moment we called in the order. I think that was pretty quick considering they had to make the food, package it, and drive it to us, all within that time frame. We forgot to ask for plates and they didn't ask us either. The only disappointment is that I expected lots of crab meat in the crab fried rice similar to OSHA Thai or at least some lump crab pieces but instead it was just fried rice topped with a scrambled egg/crab mixture. It also lacked the aromatic crabby smell which I love but overall, it did the job. It fed our starving party of 6 dinner in our hotel room and we still had enough leftover for a breakfast snack the next morning.",

I even stayed and waited while she took her time to look at this $10 bill, i asked her if everything is okay and her reply back to me was \"we'll find out\" with a dirty look as if im a crook. I told her i work a couple stores down and if there is any problem come look for me, but really?! It was a $10 bill meal. I understand it is important to check for counterfeits but the attitude following up with it was undeserving especially as I waited patiently for her to check,   If thai noodle house is reading this, this is eric, one of your regulars that orders from you guys at least 3-4 times a week.",

But never judge a book by it's cover! The Roasted Duck Noodle Soup with Egg Noodle is amazing! A great hangover cure.. the broth is not too salty with a hint of sweetness from the duck. I do wish they would put bigger pieces of duck meat in it though, but other than that, one of the best duck noodle soups I've had ever. Also, the Roast Duck fried rice is pretty good also.. I think that it has gone down over the times I've gone there (maybe 5-6 times already). They started adding PINEAPPLES to the Roast Duck fried rice now.. so if you're not a fan of pineapples, make sure to ask for none. Anyways, this place still remains a tradition with me and my friends whenever we come to Vegas. Whether it's before we leave for home or just picking up a quick dinner/drunchies before clubbing, I know this place can deliver a great tasting and affordable meal!",

The in both places is really good and affordable.  The difference is the parking and atmosphere.  The parking at Fort Apache is typical strip mall parking while the one in Chinatown is less convenient.  You have to park around the corner and walk.  The one of Fort Apache has more room, is cleaner, and newer.  Also, I love food that is very hot (spicy).  I asked for 7 our of ten and it nearly burned my lips off.  I don't know if that is standard or if they just messed mine up.  Overall, I highly recommend this place.  The food is plentiful, affordable, authentic, and delicious.",

    "text": "HIdden MF'ing gem in Las Vegas.  If you have a car or are not afraid to venture off the strip for some cheap, good eats, this is the spot to go!  It was a lenten friday on our vacation, so we were on the search for some seafood.  We didn't feel like paying $30 for a buffet or eating some fried fish sandwich from a fast food joint, so one of us came up with the great idea to have some Thai food.  Yelp to the rescue!  We were about a mile from this place, and a 4.5 star average?  We can't lose.  And we definitely did not.  We started off by sharing the seafood tom yum soup, which was delicious.  It had shrimps, mussels, squid, and fish balls.  We ordered it medium, but would have definitely been ok with mild, as we were all dripping in sweat by the time we took our 2nd and 3rd bites.  For my entree, I went with the green curry with shrimp.  I wish there was more shrimp, but the food itself was very well prepared and tasted great.    Other entrees on my table were pad thai, 5 spiced (?) salmon, and some other fried red curry salmon.  It was meat-less friday remember?  haha  All of us had nothing but positives to say about our dishes.  And, all the dishes were less than $10.  Score!  The service here is excellent as well.  Seeing our sweat soaked faces, the waitresses were quick to refill our waters and even put the fan next to us.  Lol.  I have never been anywhere that would actually do that for you.  haha  Parking is a bit weird here.  I did not see a parking lot, except for the one across the street, so we had to play frogger in Las Vegas chinatown, which was another adventure in itself.    Overall, food is excellent and I will be back.",

    "text": "I've heard so much about Thai Style Noodle House from my vegan friend Don before I joined Yelp. And then, the accolades came pouring for this hole in the wall joint on Yelp. Of course, I had to come see for myself. I'm surprised it's taken me this long.  We entered the restaurant and it was exactly as I expected. T shirts on the wall, a couple of small pictures hanging up, old tables and chairs. The 2 waitresses for the night were having their own dinner in the corner but they were quick to give us the menus and take our drink order. I appreciated that. While we looked at the menu, the waitress was kind enough to ask us if we were meat-challenged and then whipped out a vegetarian menu for us to order from. Yay!   Our order tonight:  Papaya Salad : Green Beans, slivered raw papaya, tomatoes in a tangy, sweet dressing with just a hint of spice after every mouthful. I was licking the plate clean. I thoroughly enjoyed this salad  Basil Fried Rice with Fried Tofu : My husband's order. I ended up eating lots of it. The fried tofu tasted divine. Honestly, there wasn't much of the basil flavoring in the rice but I still thought it was tasty. My husband wasn't a big fan as he thought it didn't really taste like how it was supposed to (he swears by Komol's Basil Fried Rice)  Green Beans and Tofu in a Red Curry Paste : This was my least favorite of the 3 dishes we ordered. It tasted sort of strange...and very much like the red curry paste was processed. My husband actually quite enjoyed it and said there was a lemongrass taste to it that was pleasant but I have to differ on his opinion.   Our total bill (including a 15% tip) came up to 25 bucks. This cannot be beat. Period.  Yes, the portions can't feed 16 people and the restaurant might need some interior decorating intervention but I thought the taste of the food was good, the menu interesting, the service friendly and fast and the price very reasonable.   I will definitely be back...maybe for a lunch special or the Khua Kai Noodles which sound so interesting. Komol still ranks my Number 1 in Thai favs but this little treasure has definitely earned a place in my go-to restaurants.",

The serving is big and they give plenty of duck meat. They even debone the duck so it's not so messy or tedious to eat. Broth is dark and so savory.

The people there were pretty friendly and I tried to order what got the most press on Yelp.  My wife thought the pad thai was pretty good, but I got the crab fried rice and it lacked a bit of taste. I put a ton of hot sauce on it and it killed my appetite because I was starving, but I wasn't impressed.   The mango sticky rice was pretty good. The rice was salty and the mango was sweet. This was the request of my wife's so I honored it. It wasn't bad and the prices were decent based on what you got, but I can't give it 4 stars because of taste.  It is a good find and maybe if I got something else I would be happier. They feature the hot soup, but when it's 115 degrees outside soup is the last thing you want.",

    "text": "Thanks to Misti Y's review tipping me off to the vegan-friendliness of this place, I have expanded my realm of Las Vegas Thai food!   Important note: do no use google maps to find this place, because you will end up at a XXX bookstore.  Which is cool if you need some porn to read over lunch, I guess, but annoying if you're just hungry.  The map shown here is correct (why didn't I just trust Yelp??) - it's two doors down from Veggie Delight.  So, yes, they are very accommodating with the vegetarian/vegan requests and happy to oblige.  I went at lunch, but ordered off the dinner menu.  Now, this may have been a mistake simply because they have an awesome lunch special! You can choose an appetizer (fried tofu, soup, or spring roll, I believe - the fried tofu looked awesome!) and one entree (~$5.45) or two (~$7.25).  That's a lot of food for cheap!  We shared a papaya salad, green curry with tofu and vegetables, and chili basil fried rice with tofu and veg.  We ordered everything a 7 out of 10 spicy, and it was perfect (I do like pretty spicy food!).  First, let me give these folks some love for NOT putting the much-maligned baby corn in any of our food.  The mere appearance of those mutants is always a buzzkill when I'm about to dig into a dish.  Second, the portions were very generous.  I'm a hearty eater as is my friend, and we had enough leftovers for at least one of us to stuff ourselves again.  Third, everything was very tasty.  Maybe not the best I've ever had, but delicious enough for me to eat til I hurt.  Four, the prices! Cheeeeeaaaaaaaap! $6.95 for a huge entree? yes please!  The ambiance was nil, but the service was friendly and fast, and I don't got to a tiny Thai place for lunch because of the ambiance.  This place is definitely going in the rotation, and next time hopefully I won't forget to order brown rice!",

    "text": "Visit #3:  I recently had the Chu-Che Salmon, which is a salmon dish with a panang-like curry.  This was a very good dish, with a strong, flavorful curry.  The salmon was nicely cooked with a hint of char.  There was a white, creamy sauce on top of the salmon that helped push the taste of the curry over the top for me.  The panang was slightly thick, as panangs tend to be.  I was very impressed with the flavor, much better than the last curry I had here... not sweet, and full of unique flavors.  Apparently this is a new dish, and if this is any indication of the potential flavors of the other curries, maybe my last visit was a fluke.  I am officially putting Thai Style Noodle House on my Best of Thai list!",

I had narrowed it down to a couple of well-reviewed options outside the strip and chose 'Thai Style Noodle House' simply 'cuz I was craving something  spicy and hot.   This small place seemed unimpressive went I entered in with a fierce waitress yelling out the orders. It was useful that we were handed a vegetarian menu as it just makes ordering so much easier. We ordered Fried string beans with peanut sauce (3 stars out of 5), Tom tum soup (5 on 5), Red curry (4 on 5) and Fried eggplant and tofu plate (5 on 5). At the end of the day, I would definitely recommend this place if you just want GOOD food.",

Imagine the spicy, sour-sweet Tom Yum soup but in a large bowl for one with noodles (I usually get thin noodles).   So delicious and feels up the tummy.  It is just the thing for when I am not feeling well or my stomach is not feeling great.  It is comfort food.  Get very spicy (6 or higher) to clear up your sinus.  I've tried a few of the other dishes, like Pad Thai, and they are just okay.   The portions are huge and the prices are very affordable.   Indoor space is small though so you may have to wait during prime hours.  Parking is plentiful in the plaza or across the street, in the Ranch 99 plaza.  After eating out so often, I've come to realize that a restaurant will usually have only one stellar dish.  For Thai Style Noodle House, that dish is the Tom Yum House Noodle Soup.",

There were five of us in our group, and our total bill was around $45, a great deal! I give this place 4/5 stars because the service wasn't totally top notch, we only got our drinks refilled at the end of our meal, and our waitress only checked on us once. If it were busy, I would have easily forgiven that, but it wasn't busy at all, so I think checking on us a couple times couldn't have hurt.",

Don't expect to get the greatest service because you are not paying that much for the food.  But don't get me wrong, everyone is really nice and courteous, just don't expect a sommelier (I googled the spelling of that) to explain their wine list to you.  The place is packed, sometimes you gotta wait a while to get a table, sometimes you will be ignored when you want someone to take your order, sometimes you may feel rushed.  But you know what?  It's still THAT good, and everyone comes back.    Speaking of thai food, can someone invent a somewhat healthier version of Thai Iced Tea?!?  We have invented cellular phones, we send space ships to the moon, but we can't make a healthy Thai Iced Tea???!!!!!!  I was excited earlier, but now I am upset!!",

When I tried to explain to her that I'm only a few cents short of the minimum & that the other location certainly could still do the transaction even with my situation, she just ignored me or said nonono. The Thai tea that time tasted horrible & I usually like the Thai tea there. I dunno what was with that lady but I just thought it was dumb how they refuse to do the transaction when noodle house 2 gladly told me that it was fine.

    "text": "Amazing thai food!! The place was a little hard to find. It's a really big plaza and going by the address numbers don't help much. It'll be on the side facing Wynn.   Once we found the place we weren't exactly too sure if we were in the right place because all it said was noodle house but once we got inside the full restaurant name was painted on the left with a cool mural as well. The mural looked like a hole in the wall, which is exactly what the restaurant is. We were seated very quickly and you can easily tell how busy they were.  On to the food, my boyfriend and I ordered the pad see ew, bbq over fried rice and the Tom yum soup with the think noodles. Sorry no pictures cause we ate it too quickly! The food came out very quick considering a huge family was still waiting for theirs. A little bit of background, my boyfriend is thai and his mom is also a retired Thai chef and we've visited Thailand together twice. So trust that we know good Thai food, and trust that the food here is amazing. The pad see ew tasted just like how his mom makes it. Savory but sweet and with a large portion as well. The bbq chicken over fried rice was my favorite though. The fried rice was really yummy and the bbq chicken came with a sweet and sour sauce that you can dip it in. The Tom yum soup was an okay dish to me, Thai people love their lemongrass and it was a little bit too much for me. We got a level 8 spicy but if you're not used to Thai spicy the level 5 is spicy for Americans. Don't test yourself or try to act cool and get 10... You'll die so don't think about it. The waitresses were very nice and no matter how busy they were they took their time with each customer and checked to see if there was anything else needed. They never rush you to get out but it's courteous not to stay long after your meal so that the waiting customers can grab a seat to eat.  The Overall, very big delicious portions and this will definitely be our Thai spot whenever we visit Las Vegas and make sure to stop by every time too!",

I ordered Rad-Na with beef, crab rangoon, cucumber salad, sticky rice and a Thai tea.  ($27 after delivery and tax) Everything tasted good,  I had no complaints there, I was actually kind of surprised to be honest.    But my Rad-Na had no meat at all.  I called the restaurant and told them I had no meat in my order. She began to ask how I mixed everything together because the meat probly fell to the bottom and that my order cannot be cooked without meat and so on and so forth. Like really!?! She insisting theres meat in my order when I have it right in front of me, looking at it. I'm not trying to get extra meat without paying for it, come on now.  She said she would bring me another gravy meat and  broccoli mixture, I insisted I only needed the meat but after another 50 minutes I recieved the whole gravy muxture with about 10 peices of thin slices of beef, I'll take it, it's enough to eat at least half my noodles. This is the 3rd place in Vegas that I came across that has been cheap as heck with the meat.  Like,  don't give me all these damn noodles and sauce if your not going to add the appropriate portions of everything your supposed to!!   (3 stars Just because the food was good in taste and yelp doesn't allow half stars or it would have been 2.5)",

(They even print 'vegan' on the receipt, which seems minor, but I really appreciate the nod that they recognize it's important to you. Vegans and vegetarians should feel comfortable eating here.)  Sorry to bury the lead but I ordered the spicy eggplant with tofu and vegetables. The eggplant had a tasty, delicious thing going on. Everything was nice. For $7.45 before tax it's a good value. I added an extra side of rice for $1.25 more; we sent $0.71 to the Nevada government so that they wouldn't lock us in a cage; and after paying off Pui for being wonderful, it was a $12 lunch. Money well spent, 5 stars all day.",

    "text": "Papaya salad at level 6 was hot enough for the wife, but I wanted it hotter, as everything else we ordered was very mild.  I had some in Thailand that set me on fire, this was not close. I'd try at least 8 next time.   Pad see-eu with beef was great, I added the bright red chili sauce to light it up. Kids had Khua Kai noodle and bbq pork with Chinese sausage fried rice, both very mild and kid friendly. The salmon avocado curry was really good, bright orange curry with coconut milk and tiny shreds of kaffir lime leaf, and just a bit of heat. My fault for not ordering the hot stuff, but what we had was fresh and tasty.   Wait staff was friendly and helpful, water glasses filled often and plates cleared timely.   The men's bathroom, however, was another story. The grime covering the light switch and the door was worthy of the worst gas station bathroom, a foot above and below the knob it was black with grime. I mean black!  The vent fan had so much dust on it you could not see the grate. And it needed a coat of paint. With that lack of cleaning in the bathroom, it makes me wonder about the kitchen. I've been to many hole in the walls with run-down bathrooms, but this was just plain filthy. So I had to deduct a star.  So really, this is about a 3.5 star review, as the place is not really a 5-star.   But even so, I'd probably come back here for the cheap and tasty.",

Okay so upon walking in, you can see clearly that it is just a hole in the wall kind of restaurant. I will go as far as saying that if I were to sit down and eat here, it is like eating in the bathroom of a gas station. I'm truly sorry if I just ruined your appetite. Instead, I asked for a to-go order of a papaya salad and a red curry with tofu. The papaya salad was extremely fresh because the vegetables were very nice and crunchy. Love it!!! Similarly, the red curry had just the right amount of viscosity while being flavorful and delicious and full of fresh ingredients. So good that I ate half the container without even realizing it.

    "text": "What I know about Thai food could scare the bejeebers out of my Midwestern Grandmother, but no one in this town would be fooled for even a moment.   Walking into the Thai Style Noodle House, I knew I was about to sacrifice one of my favorite things about the \"new dining experience\". That is, I love asking the server to make recommendations, you can learn a lot about a place from this simple question. But I know from experience that Chinatown servers are not into recommendations, at least not to a 'pale-white farm boy', other than boring, ordinary, tasteless, \"American Style\" dishes that are sure not to offend any taste buds. Of course, I always have Yelp to guide me to something on the menu that is likely to please.  As I expected, when I ordered the Noodle House Tom Yum Noodle Soup (fat noodles with a 7 on the spice range), I got a series of questions from the server, all apparently designed to discourage me from my order: \"It's sour.\" she says. \"Sure you want soup?\" she asks, \"That's very hot.\" came her final plea, with a combined look of confusion and compassion (the later to be served after diner).  The fat noodles were a perfect compliment to the hot and sour soup and a 7 on the spice level sat just perfect with me. A great big thank you to the Yelpers out there, who provided the ammunition I needed to complete my order without the assistance (or even approval) of the server. Don't get me wrong, she did a splendid job and was very attentive to my water glass (Misty and I are simpatico on this matter), she just looked frightened that I would have a coronary and she'd have to cover my tab out of her tips.  There is a sister restaurant out in my neck of the woods that I will be making regular visits to as I learn more about this Thai food craze everyone's going on about - :).   I figure I got a good ten years left before I have fully traversed the culinary landscape that is Chinatown alone, so many wonderful new flavors for the tongue. The Noodle House is definitely going to become one of my new standards, even if they never stop looking terrified of my menu selctions.",

    "text": "I can't believe I've never reviewed this place..   I'll try to fit in all I can muster about my favorite China Town area restaurant.  My mom's Thai and a really good home cook. But since we're all grown now, she doesn't make huge family style meals anymore. So. This is my go to Thai restaurant.  It's not fancy, it's not over priced, it's not a new take on Thai. It's pretty much the classics done simply and executed well. Plus the price is definitely right. I'm pretty sure nothing is over $10..I think.. Well..  maybe! If you do seafood it might be.  My favorites are definitely the same as most yelpers:  Noodle house style pot stickers are always a good start.  Noodle house Tom yum soup with choice of noodles which I get the fat noodles- spice a 10.  My favorites include: Roasted duck curry 75% of the time, duck Fried rice(ask for chili in it and it makes it even better), the roasted duck soup with egg noodles, fried chicken over fried rice, BBQ park and Chinese sausage fried rice, lad nah, grilled beef salad with a side of sticky rice, their version of pho lol, Tom kah kai, and pretty much everything on their menu.  It's all really good.  My only let down was the pork wonton soup I got tonight with egg noodles. Fresh, but a  pretty bland broth.  A huge plus is they can make their papaya salad LAOS style, which I prefer, and it's actually really good :]   With Ling Ling as the best server ever and down to the padak on the table as a condiment, this place is pretty authentic and never disappoints me.   Idk if this is for regulars but the service is always super sweet. If I don't finish something for ANY reason I.e. Being full or saving for later.. The Ling Ling always asks if i enjoyed it or if I need it replaced if I may not have liked it. So nice :]  It's tiny so expect a tiny wait at times, the food is worth it, and try not to sit in that center table when it's sunny..  Random thought:  My favorite thing about eating a Thai meal is that it's usually family style. I wish they had an options of ordering a bowl or pot of some of the dishes.. If that makes any sense :] but I'm sure there's a reason they dont offer that. Limited table space..?",

Stir fry rice noodles with eggs, peanuts, bean sprouts, & green onion. Portion sizes are medium-large.  -Pad see-eu ($7.25): Similar to pad thai; stir fry rice noodles with eggs but now with broccoli & a different sauce. -Thai Fried Rice ($6.95 chicken, pork, beef): Delicious!  I still have to try more of their other entrees, but these 3 are my favorite there :)",

    "text": "Long overdue review of this diamond in the rough restaurant. We only stopped here because it popped up on maps when searching for Thai near where we were. I'm glad we did, though, because the food was bomb.   We ordered a papaya salad, pad Thai, pad see ew, and beef jerky. The papaya salad had all the flavors I love - fish sauce, lime, chili, etc. and had just the slightest bit of a kick to it. It paired really well with the beef jerky, which was a mix of sweet and salty with just the right amount of chewiness. Both dipping sauces for the beef jerky were good, too. The pad see ew was one of the best I've ever had. The beef was tender, the broccoli still had some crunch, noodles were nice and chewy like they should be and the sauce had a nice balance of the sweet and salty, too. The pad Thai was delicious. The sauce was tangy and flavorful and there was plenty of it so the noodles weren't dry. A must order!  The place was pretty stuffy inside and the smell of the chili's cooking made its way out to the dining area, which made a few folks (and staff) cough a bit. The staff was friendly and the service was good. Would come back again.",

We ordered our dishes without onions, but after the server brought our friends their dishes, she then told us that they put onions in ours and would have to wait for them to remake it. We didn't want to wait since our friends were served already, so we picked out the onions. The portion size that we got was smaller then the order our friends had (and it was the same dish). The pineapple fried rice was lacking flavor and I had to put a lot of chili sauce in it to finish a portion. The Thai iced tea and coffee were great and strong. Parking is limited but nearby.",

    "text": "It's gonna be a NO for me!!!! Clearly I missed the rave bandwagon on Thai Style Noodle House (Spring Mountain/Wynn) location. For starters I have been recommended this place plenty of times and finally decided last week to give them a try. Really been craving Thai food these past few weeks so I thought why not?! My co-worker and I took our lunch break together after an appointment with a client and just so happens she loves Thai food as well.  When we walked in, there really wasn't anybody working but the kitchen people. Finally after just guessing to just seat ourselves that's exactly what we did. Maybe 5 minutes later a lady from the back came out and gave us menus. We inquired about them having any kind of lunch specials and was shut down really quick like \"No! No lunch specials here.. we too small for that\" I'm like huh?! okay girl whatever tell us what's good here then... She then said \"Other location have lunch special we don't\" Okay.. we get it no lunch special that's fine so tell us what's good here.. She was clueless I was already starving and this encounter was getting me even more irritated than I already was. Time was being wasted and we had to get back to work.   Finally we ordered.. Egg rolls... Yellow Shrimp Curry & Shrimp Pad Thai. Entire meal was just like huh is this really what people are raving about? Our first batch of egg rolls came out and they were burnt, sent those back and by the time the new ones came the actual entree's were also ready. My co worker and I both agreed that the shrimp that was in both of our dishes was way too fishy and I just can't eat seafood when it has that particular taste. I eat plenty shrimp and I know it's not suppose to taste like that.. When we brought it to the severs attention she could careless. I didn't make a big deal about it because it just wasn't worth it.. I just won't be back it's that simple.. I hear the other location is better but I'm even questioning wanting to try that one out...",

It is right across to the East from Chinatown Mall which also has parking problems during prime eating hours.  Service: Service was alright. In high peek times it might be slowed down. But I promise you. The food will make it up.  Food: * Beef / Pork Jerky \"Beef / pork marinated in special Thai herb, dried in one sun and deep fried\" - We chose the beef option and the date is the real expert on this since he tends to get it a lot.  I found it to be just okay though, it was a bit too dry for me.  (Whereas other places make their variation a bit more moist.) * Grill (Chicken, Pork, or Beef) Salad \"Your choice of sliced meat cooked with red and green onions, mint leaves, ground roasted rice, chili, and lime dressing.\" - We chose the beef option and I loved it b/c of the sauce and zest. * Pad See-eu \"Stir fried flat rice noodle and egg, Chinese broccoli in sweet black soy sauce.\" - This was okay with chicken and greens, although it was a bit flat. * Yellow Curry \"Thai yellow curry with your choice of chicken, pork, beef mixed with bell pepper, bamboo shoot and basil served over steamed rice.\" - We chose vegetarian with soft tofu and I'm always a big fan of Thai curries.  They didn't disappoint here - good flavor and spice.  This was the real winner for me and I definitely would be back to try out their other curries.  We also had Thai iced teas all around.  * Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice ($3.50)  WiFi (For Yelpin + Insta): Unable to access WiFi. Talked to staff, and they didn't have the WiFi Password! But gawd damn it, the food so good. Your phone is going to stay down!  Overall: HELL YES! COME HERE!! ",

They have a sauce on the top that balances the flavors really well. I also got the panang curry with white rice and I really liked the flavors and spice level. Even though this was \"mildly spicy\" it was still pretty spicy. The level though was perfect for me! I divided my order with the hubby and I thought the portions were good for two people.   I am looking forward to dining in this restaurant and trying more items from their menu. Thanks for the fast service and good food!",

    "text": "It's cheap, it's hot and it's pretty tasty. For a strip mall Thai food, It's not bad and the prices are fair.   Ordered the tom kha soup, appetizer combo and the drunken noodles.   The tom kha soup was very flavorful, but the piece of lemongrass were very small and there were a lot of them. I had to keep picking them out with each bite. The appetizer combo came with 1 egg roll, 2 crab rangoon, 2 wonton, 2 chicken satay and 2 fried tofu. The satay was flavorful but overcooked. The wonton and the crab rangoon were almost identical, not a lot of care in wrapping or presentation.   The drunken noodles were also chicken, and the chicken was overcooked. The noodles did not look the most appetizing and there was not a lot of fresh ingredients like bean sprouts or basil. It tasted good, but it was a heavy noodle dish which needed some garnish and presentation.   I was starving when I came in the door. I walked out full. It was pretty cheap. Would I go here again? Maybe if it was 3 am. If I had a night ahead of me, i'd go to Lotus of Siam.",

It's really small inside with seating for 2 dozen people at a time. Depending what day and time of the week you visit there will be a wait time.   Service is pretty much good and have been consistent especially how busy they can get. However, the food here is really good and the price point makes this place a good value for authentic Thai food in the vicinity. Some of the dishes that I personally love is the Panang Curry, coconut based curry sauce with a spicy and tangy taste paired well with rice. Another dish worth mentioning is the Pad See Ew, soy sauce based with flat rice noodles with the option of your choice of protein. On cold nights, their Tom Yum soup with seafood is spot on delicious and flavorful with your choice of noodles.   Pro-Tip, many of the dishes are for individual serving but you can opt to have a la carte for a more sizable and family style portion to share in your group. Overall, a great place to have homestyle Thai food in the Chinatown area!  2018 Yelp Review #30",

My husband doesn't like it spicy so I ask them to bring the spices on a side and add the red pepper flakes. So yummy and refreshing! Our favorite dishes are usually wide flat noodle dish, spicy basil fried rice, Tom kha or Tom yum soup.  Basil fried rice is sometimes disappointing as it's a bit too wet for me, but in the past, It was just right and delicious, so Probably it is chef dependent. But overall, we love this place and will keep coming back!",

We were seated right away (5).  They checked in often and our cups never went empty.    So, the two stars is strictly for the food.  What we had:  - pot stickers - The sauce (mayo mix and something else) was sweet.  I'm not a girl that like sweet sauces on her pot stickers.  I like a little tang to it. - beef noodle soup - I thought this had a bit of a sweet flavoring to it as well.  It was merely ok. - duck fried rice with pineapples - ok - pork fried rice with Chinese sausage - I've never had Chinese sausage before so I wasn't expecting the sweetness. - chopped chicken w/sticky rice and papaya salad - rice was hard and papaya salad's fish sauce was a little too much for me - chicken satay on a stick - ok  I'm not a girl that likes her meats or soups sweet.  So, forgive me if these dishes are supposed to be that way.  This place wasn't my cup of tea.  My husband completely disagrees.  He loved it here...but he can write his own damn review.  ;)",

Came here after a long day of hiking, and boy did the food really hit the spot as far as healthy and energizing goes! Their menu is colorful with a lot of variety of foods that are vegan/vegetarian friendly, or otherwise tasty and nutritious in its own way.  Heed warning to the level of spiciness they ask you (which can be found throughout many other reviews here too!) I learned my lesson with the papaya salad that medium is blazing hot in Thailand's culture. Despite how delicious the papaya salad was prepared, not even halfway through my taste buds were on fire and my lips were feeling like they were seared off! Lesson learned with that, but the papaya salad was still fabulous, as well as the pot-stickers (the sauces really compliment the appetizer just right!)  My favorites were the Red Curry Chicken and the Thai Tea. The Thai Tea is a MONSTER, they serve it to you in a huge mug and if your food has a little kick, the Thai Tea is actually a good remedy to cool down your taste buds! This place is very small in size and I hope they will expand it over time, but this has to be one of my newfound favorite places in Las Vegas and the Chinatown area to venture!",

Normally, the service is crappy and the food is alright but here both are great! I do have to say they have opened up another place near Fort Apache, but I've never been there.  The place always has people inside and the aroma as you walk up to the door is enough to make your mouth water.   I normally call my order in ahead of time to take my meal home, and they're pretty good at being speedy.  My favorite dish would definitely have to be the Thai fried rice with chicken. The dish has the perfect amount of onions and chicken and rice and seasonings. This dish is enough for two people or two meals for one (which is what I do).  I would also recommend #38, which is sorta like pan fried noodles with bean sprouts and a sweet/spicy sauce.  I've never had the Thai iced tea but it's a nice orange color and from what I hear, it's pretty good if you're looking for a cool refreshing drink.  It's a very small, quick and inexpensive lunch if you're looking for something new. And afterwards, you can just drive down Spring Mountain and go shopping at the Fashion Show Mall!",

If Lotus is my classier and more diverse wife, Thai Style Noodle House is my down-to-Earth and no BS mistress.  There are times when I just want to be taken care of, I don't want frills, just delicious, authentic, straight-up Thai goodness.  Those are the times I go to Thai Style.  She's all content, inexpensive, gives more than receives, and I love her.  Everyone loves the noodle soup for a good reason, it's probably the best and cheapest you'll get in Vegas.  But don't forget to try other things, like the ginger snapper or the duck pad kee mao, both yummy!  The squid salad is not as good as Lotus, but it's half the price so there you go.  I'm sure there are things Lotus doesn't do as well as Thai Style.  Oh, am I defending my mistress over my wife?  I'm sorry, sometimes I can't control myself.  Well, there's another thing with my mistress.  She surprises me with how thoughtful she can be.  There's a waitress at Thai Style that has an amazing memory.  I've been there three times, and she already has my preferences tattooed into her memory.  Yep, come on in to Thai Style.  She doesn't have to just be mine.",

    "text": "Tried this place about half a year ago for the Seafood Tom Yum, and while I thought it was very good, it didn't leave enough of an impression on me to find me craving it regularly.   Last week I decided to give it another shot and ordered two other Yelp review favorites, the Papaya Salad and Duck Fried Rice.  My thought was I'd counter the unhealthy fried rice with the papaya salad and maybe eat half of each.   The best laid plans of mice and fat men....  Went and picked them up (service both times seemed a little rushed, but not unfriendly).   Prices are pretty standard.    Upon getting back to my office I went for the salad first.  I thought it looked really nice, but I didn't enjoy the flavor at all.  Now it must be said for the 50th time how much I typically do not like salad so maybe it's personal, but I found the bean sprouts in particular to have that dirt taste that they sometimes get.   Or is this the way bean sprouts are supposed to taste?  I love them cooked usually, but maybe raw they taste like dirt.  I didn't get any sweetness from the papaya and I ordered a 7/10 and wasn't getting much spice either.  Maybe I was eating it wrong.  Either way, YELP YOU FAILED ME ON THIS ONE.  But redemption comes in the form of Duck Fried Rice.  Holy Moly.  Toss that silly salad aside and dig in.  Now it doesnt seem too complicated:  take greasy fried rice, add a healthy amount of unhealthy, fatty duck and voila!  A star is born and a salad is forgotten.   Yeah that half and half plan earlier?  Chucked it in the trash along with the salad, and devoured the entire box of fried rice.  Cancel Dr's appointment for tomorrow and call it a day.  Duck fried rice - 5 stars.  Papaya salad - 1 star.   5+1/2 = 3.   I can do Arithmetic like Bill Clinton.",

Maybe the restaurant was just a cover for a massage parlor or high stakes poker game. The available tables were sloppy, and greasy -with dirty dishes everywhere. Not a good first impression to say the least.....  After looking over the menu, we decided to give it a shot. My wife ordered 2 entrees (she is not fat I swear). First, she ordered the beef Thai noodle soup. The broth was fantastic, however the beef was fatty --EWWWW.   Her second entree was the cashew chicken. Not bad, but we have had much better versions of this dish in the Las Vegas area. I decided on the chicken basil fried rice-level 5. The rice was a little greasy, but very good. I am glad I didn't go over a 5 on it-- it had some heat!  Our total bill with soft drinks came out to about $25.00.  This place isn't bad, but I don't think I would go out of my way to come back. If I do, I'll make sure to bring money for the buy-in so I can sit on on the game going on behind the scenes.",

There is hardly a wait to be seated and if there ever is, it is well worth it! The food is divine, very tasty and the portions are more than generous! The pricing is very reasonable for what you get. My wife and I ordered edamame, crab fried rice, (my favorite) the duck noodle soup and desert; all for about $20. If you have never tried duck I highly recommend the duck noodle soup, the broth is so flavorful and the pieces of duck are very tender. I'm not to big on fried rice but this crab fried rice is the best I have ever had!!! You really get that delicious crab flavor with out it being fishy in any sense. For desert we had the fried banana with ice cream which was just as delicious as the rest of the meal.",

We were lucky to get there early before a huge crowd of people showed up. It was so full people turned away because you are basically waiting in the dining room.  However, the food was outstanding! I ordered the Tom Yum with the assortment of meats. I was asked how hot I would like it between 1-10. I said 6 because I didn't want anything too powerful, but I am one who usually doesn't shy away from spicy. It was maybe a notch below where I'd like it, but after eating all the soup it was certainly enough.  We also ordered the Thai iced tea. It also was incredible.  Overall, my wife and I loved the little place. We would love to come back when we visit Las Vegas again in the future.",

Not many Thai restaurants around here make soup like that. Noodle hose style. We got a 6/10 and it was still pretty spicy. Good to share.  - Perfect for groups less than 4.  - Not much mango. small slices. Sticky rice grains were a bit hard. - Nice hole in the wall. China town vibe. Definitely coming back for more.",

We also did notice that everyone else's (Asians) plates of fried rice were fuller and were garnished nicely with cilantro and cucumber whereas ours came without SO I made sure to ask the waitress for it . Also they don't ask you what spice level you want - just have spice on the table for you to add .  Service wasn't that great, food was forgettable, and we won't be back .

When we walked in the door, the hostess said, \"We close in 20 minutes, and the kitchen closes in 8, so do you know what you want to eat? Because otherwise....\"   We were hungry, so we quickly figured it out! My friend had the duck fried rice, I had seafood pad thai, and we had calamari as an appetizer. I liked the calamari, it was meaty and piping hot, but didn't have a lot of spice or kick to it. A little sauce fixed that up, though.  My friend's duck fried rice was delicious! I had food envy for sure, but restricted myself to only one bite. If I go back, I'll definitely get more of that! My seafood pad thai was also good, but again, not much kick. That was my fault for not ordering higher on the spice level.   We were seated at a rickety corner table. This isn't a fancy place by any stretch, but if you know that going in, you'll be fine. Of course, the service was a bit on the brusque side for us, but perhaps if we'd come in a little sooner, it would have been a bit more relaxed.",

The service was excellent.   The Tom Ka Gai soup was a little watery for my taste but was delicious.  The pad see ew pork and chicken curry were excellent as well.  The price was cheaper than most thai food places.  Definitely a good value!  I will go back again to this restaurant and recommend it to my friends.",

    "text": "I had this bookmarked for a while because the cheap prices and good reviews. I honestly wasn't very impressed. First issue was that there's no parking unless you park across the street at Chinatown plaza like I did and try to cross safely. Staff is friendly. Menu is clear but most items are marked as spicy  and I don't like spicy food. This limits my options to about 10% of the menu.  I order the Tom kha with seafood and request it to not be spicy even the menu say it is. I receive a large bowl of soup. It's good but not to rave about, but then the portion size accustomed to Americans can only make you wanna rate it 5 stars:) there's some weird seafood in it I can't define and they explain to me as fish cake but not completely sure I understood that well. Tomatoes are in huge chunks with the little green top not removed. I finished it but also had to fish out bunch of things. Good thing: not spicy at all. I ordered the green curry to go also asking only if it would come not spicy. I opened it at home and holy cow, I was crying. I diluted it and had to mix with tons of rice. Good but vary standard dish for the rest. I would come back to this spot because how affordable it is, the only reason I won't is because they seem to be all about spicy food and I just can't eat spicy.",

Just a typical way. Both items were good, but I think the fried rice would be even better with more non-rice items in it.   My bill totaled 2/3 less than it usually does (as compared to my experience at other restaurants) if I was to order a side with my main dish.

My usual server (a young girl and young guy) was much nicer.   MY FAVORITE SPOT IN TOWN!!!!! Authentic Thai food cooked to absolute perfection. Extremely nice and friendly servers. It's a little hole in the wall restaurant that I absolutely LOVE. I come here at least 3 times a week by myself and order a lot of food.

Portion was so-so for $6.95 I was actually hoping for a few more pieces.   Duck (added bbq pork) fried rice 5/5 stars  Lots of meat in the fried rice! We ordered the duck fried rice but we also just love bbq pork so we added it. It was an additional $3 to add the pork but it's sooooo worth it! The dish was so good. I love fried rice and this is one of the best I've had.   Pot stickers 5/5 stars  They drizzle a mayo sauce, teriyaki, and chili sauce on it and it was AMAZING! The pot stickers itself was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The sauces topped it off GREAT!",

I was impressed by the quality and quantity of food received for such a cheap price..  VNH Service & Ambiance:  This is a tiny mom and pop restaurant with minimal seating (no more than 35+?) so the experience will be intimate.   The kitchen is just over a partition next to the cashier.  However it is a clean establishment to get your grub on. With that, our server was friendly, kept our drinks fresh and the kitchen got all four our entrees out rather quickly.  This was during the lunch rush at 12 PMish..great work.  VNH Cuisine: I had the Combo Beef Noodle Soup with Egg Noodles and it was tasty.  The broth was flavorful and they were generous with the noodles, sliced beef, beef balls and the bok choy and bean sprouts.  I sampled the duck fried rice and that was delicious.  I don't normally get excited for fried rice but I'm definitely ordering that on my next visit.  The Thai Tom Yum noodle soup was also savory.  The broths for all the soup bowls were on point, ingredients high quality and they are generous with portions.  The pictures don't do it justice.  \"I'll be back..\"  This is another gem in the Chinatown area off Spring Mountain road.  Delicious entrees for under $8 is such a win and solidifies future visits to Vegas Noodle House for me.  I look forward to trying more dishes but that's another Yelp tale, enjoy! =)",

I was sitting at work hungry as heck on a Monday when I suddenly had the urge for some good ol' Thai food. I usually don't care for Thai food just because it's so carb-y and usually not-so-cheap BUT this place is more affordable than other places I've seen and still delicious and so filling. It's actually hot too! Their scale goes up to ten and I felt like I finally got a \"seven\" that was appropriately spiced.  There are a few tables inside and they seem very efficient in regards to service. We ordered food for pick-up and it was ready within ten minutes. She quickly split our check three ways without any complaint. Parking is probably going to be a bit difficult but it's worth it. I went for the Tofu Pad Thai and I have my eye on the Pad See-eu next. If you want Thai Food that tastes good, fills you up and only burns your mouth instead of a hole in your pocket, come to Vegas Noodle House.",

Cause OMG!! Vegas Noodle House was amazing!!! And you can choose the spicy level. My brother got chicken soup with flat noodles, my mom got seafood soup with vermicelli noodles, my aunt got the beef combo soup with rice noodles and I got the beef combo with flat noodles. ALL of the soups were flippin' delicious! My mom and aunt are Thai and were speaking Thai to the servers. Lol! This place is so good we may stop by on our way out to eat there again and take some to go. Lol! The only reason I gave them 4 stars versus 5 is because we didn't try anything other than the soup and I don't know if everything else is just as good. I'd like to think so based off the soup which is 5 stars.",

I had the tom yum soup spice level 7/10 and the duck fried rice spice level 8/10 The soup was pretty savory. Though I can tell they put too much sugar to attempt to balance off a spiciness error, but it was too much and had a sweet tang to go with it. The duck fried rice was delicious, cooked well, but they got real stingy with the duck portions.   Service was alright. If I'm in Chinatown craving cheapn delicious Thai food, I would come here again.",

This yellow curry is by far the best curry that I've had & I've tried many Thai curries before! Their portion is also really great! They give more than usual places and I'm happy because I'm actually satisfied at the end of my meal!   The yellow curry has bell peppers, potatoes, carrots, onions, and your choice of meat. The flavor of the curry is so flavorful and very creamy. Usual curries are diluted and bland, but not here!",

    "text": "Ok I was totally craving Thai food, especially since I haven't had any in 4 months. But we have been really scared to try any on Spring Mountain since they all look the same and we've been hurt before. =(   Anyways, so yes, this is a hole in the wall, but it smells wonderful when you enter so we sit. Now in order to makesure we like something they bring us,  we order a ton of food like crazy. MAJOR NOTE: WHEN YOU SAY SPICY, THEY HEAR BURN BUTT SPICY. ORDER SPICY CAUTIOUSLY.   1. Potstickers - Pretty good, although a little salty.  2. BBQ Pork Wonton Soup - Very tasty, surprisingly our favorite.  3. Mongolian Beef - Good, sauce was a little runny and light flavor, but essentially good.  4. Orange Chicken - flavor good, but more batter than chicken, although it is really cheap so we really can't complain too much.  5. Spicy Basil Leaf - This is a version of my favorite dish, called other places Chili Mint chicken. At first it was so salty I couldn't eat it, but then I poured 1/2 a cup of the broth from our soup over the dish and it was perfect!!  6. Fried Banana's and vanilla ice cream - very yummy.   So all of this food plus 3 Sprites cost us a whopping $44.00, and mind you the dish sizes were huge, most of the plates were still full.   So all in all, a great hole in the wall Thai place, even though the chef is very heavy handed with the salt and chili.",

Highly recommended is the PAD THAI -- and the PINEAPPLE RICE -- i asked them to add the Chinese sausage --  very flavorful -- texture of the noodles just right -- springy -- they don't break up -- they say a good test of a rice noodle dish  is whether the noodles break off or not, if they do, then they are missing a huge component of making the dish right.  The dishes are authentic and flavorful,  and they will ask what heat scale you would like each dish on a scale of 1-10.  No Watered down version here. We were in at 3pm on a weekday, and there were many patrons. It's not a hole in the wall place-- it's a terrific restaurant great food with quick and friendly service. PLUS, easy on the pocketbook.

Going with my trusty old favorite I ordered the Pad-Thai and much to my surprise I was VERY impressed. Just the right amount of spice, sweetness, and peanuty crunch! I also sampled the sweet and sour chicken that was also very amazing. When I am back in town I will be sure to swing back by for some great Asian goodness!",

When the name of the place includes the word, noodle, you'd think noodles would show a sign of... noodle expertise.  It doesn't.  My Pad Thai noodles had gummy nodules, large clumps better eaten with the help of a knife.  And the dish was too sweet.  I kept thinking you could mold the stuff into a Pad Thai Jelly Bean or maybe a Gummy Bear.  No, it was already a Gummy Bear.  I came back to the office and brushed my teeth.    Quite a few Thai-looking folks in there, and I wondered if the family could really be that large.

The food was prepared so fast that we thought we had someone else's food. It was very fresh and flavorful. Had the Larb and Thai noodles....yummy. The Larb was some of the best I've ever had.",

I get a 6 heat level and it's perfect must try the following - you won't be disappointed. Fried Chicken over house fried rice. To die for! Pad Thai Noodles, Thai Tea and Tom-Kha ( coconut noodle soup). The chef specials Crispy Pork with Broccoli and MA Kuer Song Kran. We go to the Wynn location in China Town. The place only seats about 12 tables, no reservations and cash only. The portions are HUGE and the prices are very low for the quality of food you get. Give this place a try! You'll be hooked! We go twice a week now. Weekends get busy so know what you're going to order before you go and place your order right away. Everything is cooked to order and the yellow curry is the best I've ever had! Bon Apetit",

I tried the Pad See Ew, Tom Yum Soup, and BBQ pork and chinese sausage fried rice. The Pad See Ew was a little too sweet for my taste, but the Tom Yum definitely hit the spot. The broth is definitely more complex than I am used to getting at other Thai restaurants. There's more richness and flavor to the broth than elsewhere. If I came back I'd definitely order the soup or the noodles available with this soup. The BBQ pork and sausage fried rice was solid as well and above average.  Keep in mind that the location is small and there may be a wait at times.",

However, I have to say it's probably some of the worst Thai food I've had.  Maybe I just ordered wrong, I dunno.  Considering how many other Thai places are here in Vegas... more than you could shake a stick at.  I don't know what kind of metric that is really, is that like 15 Thai places?  I don't know how many places the average person could shake a stick at in, say, an evening..  But anyway,  I tried the Tom Yum that people have been raving about and I couldn't even eat it, I thought it was awful.  The Won Ton soup was also weak but I at least could deal with it.   I got some noodles too and they were decent, but the Pad Thai was pretty lame too.  All told, I may very well order again because it's so cheap and convenient for delivery, but I'd rather go elsewhere. :/",

After a night of drinking/partying, rather than eating pho, this place makes the best noodles. I don't normally eat the same thing each time. They allow you to choose the broth, and type of noodle you prefer. Their pineapple fried rice and their pad thai is good as well as their tom yum soup. My mouth is watering thinking of it right now! Their thai tea is superb! They have two sizes, order the large, you'll want more.   They were a little slow when it comes service, but each time I've frequent here, the restaurant is filled, with normally two workers. However, the wait is worth it!   It's sad to say that there aren't any restaurants like it here in San Jose, CA. So sad! I just want some Thai noodles! If anyone knows of a place similar to the San Jose area, please let me know!",

The thought of waiting in 110 degree weather to eat here is a stretch for me....but their noodle soup is delicious!  I've honestly never heard of a thai NOODLE soup before this place.  Upon entering the establishment at 11:30am....not even peak lunch hour...only one table was left.  The menu is extensive with the typical curries/fried noodles/fried rice/chef specialties...and a separate green menu with lunch specials. I decided to try the duck noodle soup with vermicelli upon a friends recommendation...think Vietnamese pho mating with Chinese wonton soup....and voila thai noodle soup (sliced duck, bok choy, bean sprouts, cilantro swimming in a herbal duck broth).   There are four noodle options (vermicelli, egg noodle, rice noodle, wide rice noodle) to pick from. The menu seems very extensive and it helps that the people working there are actually Thai.  The prices are very reasonable...under $7 for most dishes.     But be aware small establishment means you may end up waiting for a table...and after waiting for a table...waiting for your food to come out.  Service was extremely slow today and refills of water need to be requested.  The servers were friendly, but just extremely busy.  I would definitely try this place again....as a heads up I was informed the sliced beef noodle soup may be even better than the duck noodle soup.",

    "text": "So much MSG, oil, and salt! We felt so gross afterwards that we immediately went to Smith's to stock up on fruits/veggies for a raw food/juicing diet. True story.  We ordered: 1) Duck Fried Rice--It was so salty! I felt like they poured in a cup of soy sauce and spoonfuls of msg into that dish. Don't get me wrong, our tastebuds were overjoyed from all the flavor. But is all that flavoring really necessary? I guess that's how some people like their food cooked though; it's just not for us. I think it would've been perfect had they just cut back on all the oil and soy sauce and even left out the msg.  2) Vegetable Stir-fry--Half of our stir-fry dish was made up with rice. They gave us the tiniest portion of vegetables. Like the fried rice, I felt like the stir-fry was just cooked in a ton of hoisin sauce/msg/soy sauce/salt.  3) Thai Iced Coffee--Too sweet! I think they added sugar on top of the condensed milk because that was the sweetest iced coffee I have ever had.  Service was decent. Even though we came at a busy hour, the waitresses were still attentive to us and quick with our orders.  Our total meal came out to be $22 including tax/tip.",

I get salmon chu-chee off the specials. It's fucking amazing. I usually like trying new things especially if I haven't been to a place too often but this is one of those comfort foods that I have to get whenever I'm in town. The papaya salad is amazing as well. Their spice level is... Thai. Their \"5\" is an American \"10\" which means their spices are double compared to ours.   Didn't have a problem with this place other than that the place is tiny and the kitchen is pretty much in the dining area. So it's kinda loud if you get seated near the kitchen (you can hear the pots and pans rattling as well as the dishes being cleaned) but that's just the venue. You can tell the workers are just trying to make an honest living. I don't know if this is owned by a single family but it definitely gives off a comfortable, \"homey\" environment.

This place has severely disappointed my gf and me on our recent visit this winter.  We got there and it is busy as usual since it was lunch time. Servers seemed stressed and distracted, but I won't rail them for that. We sat down and got our menus and it took forever to take our order (10-15 min). We ordered a Tom yum noodle soup and sticky rice. Note that we came in first and got our order down first in front of three other groups who sat down after us, yet they got their food first and ours arrived last after 10-15 min. Maybe they treat their regulars or Thai people better???   So my Tom yum noodle soup was just what I expected, but the sticky rice was horrible. First of all sticky rice should be soft and easily chewable, but our sticky rice was hard to chew and majority of it still had rice uncooked!! Raw rice in our dessert? Wtf! So my gf went to the cashier to ask about it, and her response was \"no that's how it is supposed to be\" in a rude tone. I'm sorry, but we have had sticky rice from many Thai places and I have friends who are Thai that I have asked and they all say that it is not supposed to be raw!   Servers are completely incompetent and rude. Total disappointment especially after our first few visits. Maybe they should hire that girl who first helped us and made this place our first thing to visit when we go to Vegas.",

Food: Almost everything I have tried is really good. I highly recommend the Basil fried rice, the panang curry and the Pad see-ew.  Service: It's fair. If you're a regular, they take care of you. If you come in large groups they give you more food. I suggest going in between the rushes.  All in all a great hole-in-the-wall to have on your list for your Thai food cravings, which alas for me is quite often...smh...(._.)",

People would come in and out constantly.  When we got there, we were sat down immediately. When it came down to ordering, we ordered the seafood noodle soup and crab fried rice.  Although the icons on the menu signified our items were spicy, they weren't really at all.  I had asked the waitress if they had anything that would make our food spicier, and the lady said no.  Too bad for me...I love super spicy food.  Anyway, both items tasted pretty good.  I was eating hungover, and usually I don't really eat when hungover.  It somewhat curbed my hungover.  Thank goodness.",

    "text": "Disappointed that Lotus of Siam wasn't open for lunch on the weekends, I searched Yelp for the next best Thai in Las Vegas, and Thai Style Noodle House came up.  It's tucked around the corner on Wynn Road, just off Mountain Spring. Everything about it says \"hole in the wall\" except that they take credit cards. The seating area is small, so I imagine it could get crowded here during a busy time, but at lunchtime on a Saturday it was fairly open.  We ordered tom kha soup with chicken to start. It was a little too strong for my taste, and may have had a little too much lemongrass. Four of us shared yellow curry with chicken, panang curry with chicken, and pad thai. I'd say each of these dishes were between two and three stars. The curries were oily, not creamy, and the chicken at times seemed undercooked and rubbery. The pad thai noodles were too tough and chewy, but the flavoring was very good for the dish. The steamed rice was a little on the soggy side.  Our service was very good, however, and we were checked in on frequently. The pricing here was also very reasonable, which combines to save this review from being two stars, even though in terms of Thai food I really have had better.",

I was on a special quest for Thai food then and came here twice during lunch just because I love love love (that's 3) their Spicy Basil with Chicken!  A bit hole in the wall place and very affordable.   Not a big fan of their Tom Kha (coconut soup), Pad See Ew (dry version of Chinese Chow Fun noodles), and Salmon with Chu Che (curry).  They're just OK.  But it was the Spicy Basil w/ Chicken that took the spot light and gave me no hesitation to come back for seconds when a friend suggested Thai food.  Service is cool, and it seems like they have their regulars there often, so this place is proper!  *note* Spicy Thai Basil lvl 5 out of 10 gave me a good sweat even though I thought i could handle spicy.  Darn those little hidden peppers for putting me on the spot in front of my lunch date!",

    "text": "Before I hit my errands, I need some fuel for my mind and body. So what better way to fill my tank up with my favorite Thai restaurant. I actually drove down the street to drop off my clothes to the dry cleaners and next to it was a Thai place to eat, but even that couldn't stop me from driving another three miles to eat where my heart tells me.  I was greeted ever so kindly when I walked in and it wasn't surprising that almost every seat was taken. Luckily it was only me, myself, and oh yea I that wanted to dine here this day. The server asked what I wanted to drink, unfortunately they didn't have the Chrysanthemum tea, so I did my usual hot tea, but even that is soothing and delicious... tasted like a light caramel tea, but it's really jasmine tea. I was debating on the Duck Fried Rice, since Lily (server) recommended it when I ate there a couple of months ago. But I wanted some soup for my soul, because today was a very chilly and windy day. I ordered the Chicken Tom Yum Noodle Soup, Flat (fat shoe lace) Noodles, since it just makes it more delicious to me... mild (5) for how spicy I want it and this time I didn't want to torture myself as I usually do ha! and extra diced garlic.. what??!? I love garlic ok it does the body good! The soup came out in zero time and I loved the way it smelled. The steam evaporated in the air in slow motion, made it looks so heavenly fresh and I had to take a snapshot of it against the sun.. it just looked so Food Digest front cover magazine-ish. I sipped the soup broth first, it was like liquid nitrous for my engine.. my eyes lit up and made my facial muscles break a happy smile. I literally said Mmmmm gulping it down... Yea tell me about it... sound good right??!? It tasted so good, my own body melted. It had bits of cilantro, diced green onion, bean sprouts, and TONS of chunky sliced white chicken meat. Loved the flat fat noodles... it was just the right amount to make me a full bear, where I could hibernate right then and there.   But all that time I was enjoying my soup, I was also craving their Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice. I ordered that dessert right after and when it came out.. I heard from the table across from me whispering.. that dessert looks so good!! And then all this time, two guys watched me devour my lunch and then this delicious dessert... I heard him say to his friend.. Dayam that girl can eat!!! Dayam right I can!??!! I'm not shy when it comes to eating and definitely will eat to my heart's content, bet your butt I will! So I just smiled at the guys and kept on eating. I'm enjoying my meal, so let it be! The dessert was the icing on the cake... the finishing touches of a great phenomenal meal. The mango was riped and perfect to eat. Every bite of the sticky rice was warm, soft, and soothing. Loved the coconut milk that drizzled down every time I took a slice from it. The ratio between the mango slices and sticky rice was even to every single bite I took. Absolutely loved this dessert. It's my favorite Thai dessert from any other.   Their food has been consistent every single time I have gone here and the service is always very attentive and friendly. Refilled my tea without being asked and always came back to see how I'm doing. Loved the fact that after I finished my dessert, the server asked if there was anything else I would like haha I could possibly go for another dessert, but no I'll definitely be hibernating in that restaurant if I did. I always leave so happy and satisfied... No joke. And off I went to do my errands... it was a great day for another great Thai food experience.",

(feeds probably three people but i am a fatass)  to sum up, this has probably become my go-to thai place if i've ever craving thai, (which is all the time) and i recommend this place!",

I usually go for Pork because usually beef and chicken just don't have that Yum factor.. Basil was perfectly balanced through out the dish. No Negatives what so ever!  Duck Fried Rice: I think they used a brown grain rice or some fatter type of steamed rice that was cloaked in their saute oil/soy sauce or whatever they used to cook it?.. The duck  strips and shreds were sparringly spread but just enough to satisfy. Another nice portion and quite tasty as well.  Thai Iced Tea: Typical, Creamy and Refreshing especially after all those scoops of red hot chile sauce!  Little hole in the wall dishin' out  some Big flavored dishes!!

    "text": "I just love Chinatown, even for the Thai food. My new favorite place to eat there is the discreet Thai Style Noodle House located adjacent to the large Chinatown plaza on Wynn Road (a second location on Ft. Apache and Trop opened last year). Not only does it offer some of the best Thai food in Vegas, but the prices are unbeatable.  There isn't much of an ambience, but I like that quality in my favorite hole-in-the-wall restaurants. And hole in the wall this is. They aren't bringing in drive by traffic, the signage isn't great, and you park in the delivery alley, but the crowd packed in (and sometimes waiting) at lunch speaks volumes of the food and value.  The chicken larb, my husband's favorite, is top notch ($6.95). It wan't served traditionally with a cabbage wedge, but rather with chopped iceberg. Though this is a little unconventional, I liked the salad quality of the dish. The green curry fried rice ($7.95) is filled with fresh veggies and tender slices of pork, and has a slightly creamy quality. If there was risotto in Thailand, this would be it. I also enjoyed the Choo Chee Shrimp ($8.95) and Spicy Green Beans with silky chicken ($6.75). The Beef Noodle Soup ($6.50) had an exotic favor sweetened by spices, though the beef itself wasn't as tender as I would have liked.  Everything on the menu is so inexpensive you won't worry about looking at the lunch special menu, but if you are dining alone or just not a \"sharing\" kind of eater, these options will allow you to try several different item combinations for under $7.  Downside: If the place is very busy, it takes awhile to get your food. The servers are attentive and polite, however, so there is comfort in knowing it isn't taking forever because the staff is slacking off. My suggestion is to avoid peak times, or order take-out.",

It's more of a fast food place than a restaurant. The food was less than mediocre. The orange chicken was horrible. The thai noodle that is supposed to be like \"thai boat noodle\" was bland. I could have made it better. This place is totally not worth it. I wouldn't give it one star.",

Prices are cheaper than other Thai places and food is better. Why would you even go to other places?? I usually order either duck fried rice or green curry with pork. Sometime I even order another duck fried rice to go to bring back to LA, hehe. Spicy fried rice is also good. I feel like there's this special taste in all their fried rices that makes it better than others, but I just can't figure out what it is.",

I absolutely love the 19 which if my memory serves me correctly is the coconut soup. The blend of herbs, spices and coconut is amazing. I have eaten here twice. Both time I got the soups and shared with a friend. As well tried several of their Thai dishes. I haven't eaten anything here I wouldn't order again. All the food is freshly prepared and tasty. To bad I don't live in Vegas because not only is the place tasty. The portions are huge and the prices are nice. I will be making this one of my must stops anytime I am in Vegas.",

I usually like to start with their potstickers and I haven't met a person who didn't love them after trying them so I definitely recommend.   The restaurant itself is nothing fancy and pretty small, but it is pretty much always packed and I think that speaks volumes.   Having been to Thailand the food is very authentic and for a very reasonable price point!  I also like that they now have multiple locations so I can get my fix throughout the valley",

    "text": "Continuing our quest to find good, cheap Asian food off the Strip, we headed to our next stop ... Thai Style Noodle House! We originally were headed to Palms for their buffet, but since it was Father's Day and a Sunday, they only offered a pricy brunch at $22.99 each. Thus, Thai food it was.  Location: Turn on Wynn and look out for the \"Noodle House\" sign. Parking is located along all the other strip mall restaurants on the main road. The inside of the restaurant is very small; you can see all the tables once you walk into the place. Luckily, we arrived a little before the lunch rush, at 11:30, so we only had to wait 10 minutes for a table for 5. The two servers were excellent at clearing tables and getting people seated, so turnaround was very quick.  Food: We decided to order family style, so we shared the #41 shrimp pad thai, #42 pad see ew w/ chicken, thai fried rice w/ shrimp, #4 special deep fried snapper w/ ginger. The noodle dishes came out in a short amount of time, and they were fantastic! I particularly liked the pad see eww with the delicious flat noodles and the tasty sauce. The snapper was part of a sauce dish (not just deep fried and on a plate like we expected), but it was also delicious, as was the other two dishes. For drinks, we got a thai iced tea, which was a cool treat on a hot 111 degree Las Vegas day!  Best part, the bill came out to only $35 for everything (not including tip). What a steal!   Quality, authentic food, quick service, and very affordable prices. Well- deserved five stars and our favorite meal during our trip! We look forward to coming back next time we are in the area.",

Very crowded place for a weekday lunch hour, good sign. We got seated pretty quickly. Place is a tad dark inside. The menu is easy to read and understand (for those of us unfamiliar with thai food such as myself).  He got some sort of pork noodle soup, my bad I forgot the name. I ordered a very tasty shrimp dish that had rice vermicelli and crushed peanuts in it. Also it had some tiny fried egg rolls, very nice presentation. Huge portions. My guy also ordered some spring rolls which he ended up taking to go because he was too full from his entree. Service was OK, no complaints.",

The other half got there before us and ordered a whole bunch of appetizers. We then ordered some entrees and everything was good! I ordered the Beef Pad Thai, my friend got the Yellow Curry Chicken and Pineapple Fried Rice and Maribel T. ordered fried pork. Everything was Yummy! I was surprised with myself that I actually liked the curry as I am not really into curry. I'm either getting use to it, or their curry wasn't too curry for me, it was just right.  The prices are also reasonable, I think our tab was around $125 which was about 9 different entrees and quite a few orders of appetizers.  Maribel T. told me they have good papaya salad from Yelp reviews. I usually go on Yelp before trying out a new restaurant, but I didn't go it this time. I should have gone with my gut feeling in ordering papaya salad...I ended up craving it later one...Ha! a reason to go back here :)  Why 4 stars, instead of 5 stars? A little hard to find and I didn't like that the waitresses kept looking at our table to see if we were done eating, instead of coming up to our table and ask if we were done, give us our check or ask us if we needed boxes. One of my pet peeves is being stared at while eating or the feeling of being rushed...  Overall a good experience!",

Another party arrived 15mins before closing and were turned away as it was too late, so please make sure you arrive with sufficient time on your hands. We were tied between ordering the duck noodles and the pork BBQ style noodles. The hostess said both were good and we ended up ordering the BBQ pork noodles. The service was very fast. The noodles were quite good, the broth was perfect and soo tasty! We thoroughly loved our meal and left with a big tip. Definitely bookmarking this for my next trip to Vegas.

The food itself always reminds me of food my mother makes and it's great to a place that isn't too costly and gives great sized portions.   Anyway, on October 15, 2016 I went to the establishment with my girlfriend, her father and her little brother for dinner.   The food was wonderful as always, but toward the end of our meal I had ordered a to-go order of Pad See Ew and Chicken Larb at 7:45pm.   Right before I put in that order a party of 9 had just arrived arrived. I ordered my food before they even sat down.   At 8:05pm I ask the lady how much longer for my food, and she had said it's on its way.   8:15am comes around and I ask her again, and while walking away from me she says \"it's coming\"   To me, I was just wondering why a basic two dish to-go order was already taking up-wards of 30 minutes to come.   8:20pm comes along and they bring out two items to the party of 9. At that point I had asked the lady one more time and she flat out walked away from me and had not given me an answer. This whole time I was keeping my cool, but at this moment I couldn't take it any longer.   So I stand up and wait right where the cash register is. And finally at 8:25pm they finally arrive with my food. And she just hands it to me and doesn't say anything like sorry for the wait or have a good night or anything.   To me it was an absolute pathetic display of costumer service. Waiting 40 minutes for two simple items. Love this place but that left a bad taste in my mouth.",

It's on the side of the complex away from Spring Mountain Road and on Wynn Road by the Hawaiian Style Poke establishment.  I've eaten at their other locations, but for some reason I think this is the best one.  The place itself is very small with enough seating for about 30-40 people and that's pushing it.  Surprisingly though I've never had to wait too long to be seated here.  Service is always fast and efficient too.       I have ordered the: yellow curry, panang curry, pineapple fried rice, papaya salad, and chicken & shrimp silver noodle dishes and all of them have been great.  They also serve up a strong and tasty Thai tea too.  However, I think their stand out dish is their pad thai!  The portion size of the dish is extremely generous and I like how they have the pad thai and bean sprouts separate so you can control how much bean sprouts go in.  They also ask you on a scale of 1-10 how spicy you want your dish, which I appreciate as well.  No matter how many other Thai restaurants I try in the valley I will always come back to this one!",

    "text": "Absolutely amazing authentic Thai food!!!  this place has the best authentic Thai food in Las Vegas!  We had enough of high prices, long waits, and Strip quality.  I found this place while searching Maps for asian restaurants.  A short Uber ride, and we were transformed form the Strip to a normal little neighborhood.    the restaurant is located just around the corner from a strip mall.  Inside it is quiet, family run,  with basic tables and chairs.  The menu is endless with all the things you find in Thai restaurants.  Our server quickly took our drink order and offered help with choosing.  Here is our dinner for two.    We started with edamami, just enough to share.   The potstickers are obviously homemade and delicious.  The tom kha soup was perfect and big enough to share with all fresh ingredients.  the pad Thai was perfectly spiced, the shrimp Curry was nice and spicy and served with white rice.  Our food was all great and after all said and done...about $13 per person.",

My boyfriend and our two other friends ordered their well-known Beef Noodle Soup. I ordered the panang curry! I was able to try the beef noodle soup, and it was delicious!! The broth was super tastey. It reminded me of pho, but after you put all the hoisin sauce and chili to make it better. Like, the soup itself was like a ready-to-go pho that you don't need to add anything else. The panang curry definitely tasted \"homemade\"/\"grandma recipe\" kind of thing, which I loved about! There was just enough spices to make it just right in taste. I had it medium hot and it was good enough for me.   The waitress was nice, and the food came out quick. No complaints there. The price is very reasonable for the portions you get as well. I'm definitely coming back if I visit Vegas soon!",

I think they cook the fried rice in the duck fat, so you can really taste it. also, there's pinapples, which add a nice, light flavor to it. their chicken tom yum noodle is one of my favorites too. it's a simple tom yum broth with chicken and your choice of noodles. another great dish (if you're in the mood for spicy) is their spicy noodles (pad kee mao). it's stir fried spicy (your choice in how spicy) flat noodles with vegtables.",

Restaurant was small and had to wait a few minutes to get a table, but was clean and staff was friendly - definitely a very good option for solid and honest thai food with some chinese style soup options.",

This restaurant is small and can accommodate up to 30 customers.    We ordered a Beef Rad - na, Beef Pad see-ew, and a Crab Fried Rice.  Beef Rad - na - 3 stars - too much white pepper, but the gravy was fairly tasty Beef Pad see-eu - 2 stars - too much white pepper  Crab Fried Rice - 2 stars - too much white pepper and salt.  All of our dishes tasted like white pepper.  I noticed after the dishes went onto the serving table, the server would put an excessive amount of white pepper on each dish.   I am sad that we did not get as good of an experience as the rest of the yelpers.  This place is cheap, but I would rather pay a buck or two more for better tasting thai food.",

So a word of advice, go with either Mild or Medium and if it is not spicy enough, add your own spices!    The next few times around we are educated in the spice levels.  Our usual go to's for Thai plates are Papaya Salad (Fresh and Crispy), Tom Yum Soup (Delicious with white rice), then something curry or seafood.  Their Tom Yum is bomb...like as in good =)    Service is awesome and this place gets rather busy.  One time we waited around for them to open and we weren't the only ones waiting around.

Prices are really decent and food here is very good.  I ordered their yellow curry with chicken. I was very pleased as they used white meat chicken as opposed to dark meat, which I dislike.  Portion was very generous and the overall taste was good.  A great deal especially since it was only $6.75 for my meal.   Some of the other members of my party ordered their duck soup and said it was delicious. Pad thai and pad see ewe are pretty tasty too.    My hubby and I use to dine at Archie's off Flamingo as they have pretty good food too, but in comparison to this place, their prices are higher and portions not as generous.    TIP:  Skip the overpriced Thai/Asian Restaurants located inside the hotels on the strip.  Food is just ehh and not to mention, they hurt the pocket.  This place has pad thai for $6.75 while the Lemongrass located in the Aria Hotel has it for $16-20 a plate. (I am not exaggerating either!) Taste wise and price wise, Thai Style Noodle House is wayyy better.",

    "text": "Thanks to Yelp, we decided to try Thai Style Noodle House.  How could we not?  This place has awesome rating from 109 reviewers (not including mine).  Took the #203 bus at the corner of Neiman Marcus on Sands Ave, and within 5 minutes we were there.  Let me tell you, it was worth the trip.    We ordered the Thai Coffee; Fish cakes; Spicy noodle soup; and Green Curry with Tofu; and Mango with Coconut Sticky rice.  YUMMO as Rachel Ray would say.  The bill came out to be $30.  Pretty cheap for Vegas dining.    High recommend when you are all-buffet-out and want to eat good but cheap.  Good quality and great service.  Clean and spacious bathroom.  Cheers to Good Thai food!",

My family and I headed here after seeing the first showing of \"O\" at the Bellagio.  We thought it was too late, since it was already 10pm.  Good thing they don't close until 10:30 because it was well worth the wait.  We had a feast! NOTHING was mediocre.  Here's what you gotta have at some point... - Thai Iced Tea - Papaya Salad - Tom Yum Kai (w/ Shrimp) - Pad Thai (w/ Chicken) - Thai Spicy Noodle (w/ Beef...more like steak! :) aka Pad Kee Mao or Drunken Noodles - Crab Fried Rice - Roasted Duck Curry -- so good with addition of fresh pineapple - Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice (BEST EVER!!)  ** A word of caution, when you ask for a medium level of spiciness, it's gonna be pretty hot because medium Thai = super hot for most Americans.

I ordered the yen to fo noodles: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=KnaYT5QPzf1s79FqVfIg5Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a> Flavor was good and I really liked that they added the fried wonton. I haven't had this soup for years, so it was nice to see it on the menu.   And speaking of menu, they had such an extensive menu with lots of Thai dishes that you usually don't see. Everything we ordered was great. So if your in Vegas and your craving Thai food then this place is a great little Thai restaurant.   By the time we headed off, there was a line next out the door waiting. After getting Thai food, make sure you also check out the poke place next door!",

I had to add a lot of Soy Sauce. Those are the only things it was missing. Now the Shrimp Pad Thai was amazing! Flavor was good & very well cooked. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the tails were still attached to the shrimp which made it a minor struggle to eat, but that's the only thing I'd change about it. I definitely recommend the Shrimp Pad Thai and adding Chili Sauce to it makes it even better. The service was good and I'll definitely be going again.",

    "text": "Having read the reviews for Thai Style Noodle House I was really downhearted by the results. I found this location on yelp after some grocery shopping. The picture that are posted will tell the short version of this long tale!  Thai Style Noodle House is small and can only sit a very limited amount of people. This is not the best place for a party greater than 4-6 people. The table are usually set for two people and if a table with 4 shows they will combine a table for you. They only have two racks of hot sauce  holders which you must share with all the table in the restaurant.   My table of two ordered Chicken Pad Thai, Chu Chee Salmon, and Duck Fried Rice. I also had the Thai Style Ice Tea.   The place would have received four stars but some error occurred on the waitress side. I placed an order for Thai Style Ice Tea in the beginning when they ask for drinks. She returns with water for my guest and nothing for me. She places our three orders and I start to wait. Once the chicken pad thai and duck fried rice has arrived I informed her about my miss drink. She recalls and bring me the Thai Style Ice Tea. I highly recommend the pad thai because it was delicious and the thai style ice tea. I was a little disappointed in the duck fried rice since it seem to have more pork than duck. We informed the waitress that we have not gotten the Chu Chee Salmon and she informed us it was coming. By the time we finish the pad thai and was almost done with the duck fried rice the Chu Chee Salmon has arrived. I am guess she has forgot about the order until the reminder. As the two star states: \"Meh. I've Experienced better.\"",

The lady taking order was so much in a hurry and so rude! They have multiplied locations and deteriorated in quality ! The food was so horrible that We will never return and never recommend  any one. Food had no flavour and meat was not even thawed properly ! We could not finish what we ordered!",

We were given regular menus.  We had to ask for the lunch menu.  They serve $7.95 lunch specials which include a choice of 2 entrees, soup and an egg roll or won ton until 4pm.  I ordered the Garlic Pork and the Panang Chicken Curry, both Thai Hot.  The complimentary soup was Egg Drop.  It was served luke warm.  The Egg Roll was the standard vegetarian egg roll with sweet and sour sauce.  The Garlic Pork was luke warm, but the flavor and heat were good.  The Panang Chicken Curry had tender slices of white meat chicken and not much else in it.  The heat was good.  It was Thai Hot.  My friend ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Pork Green Curry.  She didn't have any complaints.",

Regardless, it was a fantastic experience. My boyfriend and I travel a lot and find ourselves at so many kinds of restaurants in many price ranges. We got a large thai iced tea to drink, roasted duck soup with vermicelli and roasted duck curry. Everything was fantastic and so flavorful. The duck was tender and delicious, the broth was bold and perfect for a fulfilling dinner. My boyfriend ordered his curry (5 in heat) and practically licked the bowl clean. We both thoroughly enjoyed everything and it was all $20! The same meal could have easily been $75-90 on the strip for the similar flavors and quality. The service was also excellent and fast. We ordered, ate and paid in about 35- 40 minutes and the restaurant was full at the time. Can't wait to come back, this restaurant is surely a new favorite. Please try and disregard some previous negative reviews, you'll be missing out by not trying this spot :)",

Tried their Pad See Eu and Rice plate with Cashew Nuts Entree- both were delicious!  The chef prepared them fresh from scratch for our order as we had requested them to be vegetarian (only with Tofu, no meat or egg). The spice was level was just right and food came out hot. Portions were more than generous at an unbeatable price. We ordered two main dishes and a Thai Ice Tea, the total came out to $17+ some change.  Ambiance is rather run down and service is also a hit and miss, but the yummy food just makes up for it. Go here only for the delicious food (and when you are really hungry ;P) and not if you are looking for something fancy. Also, they are very particular about their closing time. The hostess turned away a party of ten who entered the restaurant at 9:30 pm (they close at 10:00 pm) as it would not have been possible to prepare & serve the entire order within that time frame.",

    "text": "My mother took me here for my birthday since we were in the Chinatown area. We came expecting the same great service. Well, our experience was truly horrible. The server that we had was not the one we were used to. Initially, she was helpful despite the language barrier. When our dishes arrived, it was not what my mother indicated to her. She then became defensive and stated that it wasn't her fault that my mother did not accurately specify what she wanted.   Mom sent back the soup which she never touched and the server gave her a hard time. The server never came back afterwards to ask us if everything was okay. In fact, it was the crew member who brought my mother the redone soup and gave us the same \"it's not our fault speech\" when we asked her questions. Mom told me that the soup did not taste like what she had the last time that she went. She suspects that it was the same soup with different garnishes.  The salad that I ordered tasted fresh and fine, but was missing ingredients that I am used to seeing such as galangal, lemongrass and thai chilies. Instead, I got a sliver of jalapeno pepper and saw that they use bottled lemon juice in the kitchen. In other words, they are charging the same prices, while shortchanging the customer on authenticity. FYI, they do not make their curries in house; they use a curry mix as per their own admission.  I was going to order dessert, but changed my mind after the latter. When it came time to check out, the server ignored me refused to give me the ticket. As a matter of fact, she looked angry and had a stone face while looking sideways. The crew member was the one who checked us out and tried to diffuse the tension. We did nothing to deserve such undignified treatment.  Consequently, we left no tip and will never ever be back there!",

Both dishes came piping hot and were excellent.The spice level was just right for us. This place compares better than most Thai places i have visited for taste.

We had the papaya salad, fried chicken wings, Thai chicken curry, Thai basil fried rice, veggie tofu dish, and fried chicken over fried rice.   Prices are super reasonable, about $7 each dish and portions are generous.  Food came out in about 10 minutes and I was very impressed by how tasty all the dishes were. I ordered the papaya salad extra spicy and it was pretty spicy which I loved.. This dish is a must order because it provides some freshness for an otherwise heavy meal.   I was able to sample all of my friends dishes ( because sharing is caring ), and my faves were the Thai Basil fried rice they did not skimp on the basil, and the fried chicken over fried rice  Omfg this fried chicken was freaking fantastic, I have no idea what was in it that made it so damn good. It was super crispy and tasty. My friends and I all fought over this dish. BTW this dish did take twice as long to make but its so good its worth waiting !!!   Cheap and delicious eats !

The Thai food taste very authentic and very spicy if you don't tell them the level of spiciness!   I would come back again the next time I'm in Vegas!

The dish was really really sweet, so I didn't enjoy it-- too much tamarind and sugar perhaps. When I come here next time, I'll probably order something else. 2/5 for their pad thai  They were really nice though.

Searching yelp for places turned out to have a multitude of choices to try. We found this place based on reviews and were very happy to find an affordable thai place that had delicious food as well! We tried out the yellow curry and chicken on fried rice, chicken satay and their vietnamese iced coffee and one sip of the coffee did me in :) but the food was all very flavorful, delicious, good portions and worth every bit the price. The spice level can be adjusted as well.  I definitely  would return and try more from their menu :) and would recommend this spot to others.",

    "text": "So my parents have eaten twice at restaurants where the strip mall that has ranch 99 is, and have struck out twice.  They walked by this place during one of those meals and wanted to try it, so I took them here.  This is probably the best Thai places in Las Vegas.  When you think hole in the wall with amazing food, this is it.  It doesn't look too shabby, and you probably would miss it driving past it.  But the food makes up for the appearance and size of the restaurant.  We came for dinner on a Thursday night.  We got seated right away.  This restaurant is very small about 10 tables anywhere from 2-4 people.  The restaurant started to get sort of full right away.  We ended up ordering the calamari, Beef fried rice,rad na beef substitute american broccoli instead of Chinese, and one more dish I forget the name was, but I took a picture of it.  The rice came out first and was just enough for 3 people.  And it was excellent.  I could of eaten all the fried rice on my own.  My parents had no complaints about the calimari or the other dish.  I had the rad na, and it was really really good.  I tried a thai place just last week and it was fine, but this place was in my opinion better.  I plan to come back whenever I can.  I highly recommend this place if all the choices on Spring Mountain Road are overwhelming.",

    "text": "Good , solid Thai food. There are other places I prefer to get Thai food at but this is my go-to for Thai food whenever I'm around this area. The one on Jones & Warm Springs or the Fort Apache location does not even compare to this one (since this one is the original location).   I ALWAYS get the duck fried rice. It's my favorite dish here. I recommend ordering their chicken satay (sooo good with the peanut sauce and cucumbers , you can always ask for extra of those) , dumplings , and papaya salad for appetizers. Their Thai iced tea is pretty good , it's not too sweet and comes in a large mug just for 2$. I have to also mention that the prices here are very reasonable compared to the portion sizes. The entrees (7-9$) are shareable & enough for two. Probably the only thing I don't like is that food isn't spicy enough. Their spicy level is 1-10 , and whenever I come here I always order a 10 & it's not spicy enough :( You have to add side spices to make it actually spicy. Also , I'm not really a fan of their angel hair noodles they use in their Pad Thai. Pad Thai is usually bigger in size. Their pad see ew is really good though , they use big flat rice noodles and it's cooked to perfection with Chinese broccoli , egg and choice of meat. I like getting chicken and/or tofu with mine.  You can order most of the items on the menu vegetarian or vegan :) AND they have brown rice available. My vegan friend really liked the Tom kha (Thai spicy and sour hot soup with coconut milk).",

No where on the menu was there a note for automatic tip charge.  When we brought it up, the waitress said it was due to the holidays. (This was on 12/27/17) Once again, was not informed before hand.  Heard one of the staff say that auto tip for 3 or more, not confirmed either.  Got removed after in the end at least, so we could leave our own tip.   For an auto 18% tip, the service wasn't even that great, only ok.  Only two water came out after asking twice for water. Two waters : 4 people, that ratio seems a tad off.  Anyhoo, again, only 2 spoons came out during dessert, had to ask again so everyone on table had one.   Food was ok and reasonably priced. Ordered the basil fried rice, but it didn't have basil (hmm).  Really love the shrimp pad Thai though, very authentic!  Overall experience was ok, the tip issues at the end just left a bad feeling leaving the restaurant from a fairly fulfilling dinner.",

We also ordered the Thai satay chicken skewers and it was just okay. At times, the chicken tasted dry even with the peanut dip. Overall, I don't know what has happened.

    "text": "Behold, the long-awaited revisit! Alas, no photos because I didn't foresee this meal even happening and because of subpar battery management earlier in the day...  I enjoyed a late dinner at Thai Style Noodle House tonight with a group of 7. We actually had a ~10 minute wait, which turned out to be a good omen (as it usually is). We ate family-style and were keen on trying a lot of different dishes, including the mythical duck fried rice that my friend had recommended. Unfortunately, they had ran out of duck, which was quite disappointing at the time. After making some substitutions, we got to work on the meal.  Pad thai w/ shrimp ($7.95): it's pretty similar to every other good pad thai that I've had. It's savory and sweet. There are a lot of bean sprouts on the side.  Pad see-eu w/ combination meat ($8.95): as good as any pad see-eu (spelling variations included), with a few different meats that were all tasty, and a nice Chinese broccoli.  Three flavor grill salmon ($8.95): I haven't seen this before, but it's surprisingly good. There's also ground meat and shrimp with this, and it's largely savory. It's served with rice to help soak up all the great sauce.  BBQ pork & Chinese sausages fried rice ($7.25): another delicious order. Heavily Chinese-influenced, especially in the featured meats.  Tom yum soup w/ seafood ($7.95): not as sour as some versions that I've had, which I appreciate. Various seafood items, mushroom, tomatoes, and veggies fill the bowl. It is possibly a feat for one person even at a moderately sour level, but it is definitely a treat for a group to share.  Panang curry w/ chicken ($6.95): despite being ordered as a 3, it seemed more like a 4 or 5 to me. Maybe the inclusion of the spicy peppers did it. It's a rich curry that's maybe just a tad salty, but the rice helped to moderate that flavor.  I really couldn't find any fault with the food, and the service was solid too. The only real annoyance (aside from the 86'd duck) tonight was the smell of dishwashing. I probably sat the closest to the back area, and it was a bit annoying. Luckily, it went away before our food arrived, but it could've been worse.  There might be another hot Thai restaurant around the corner (almost literally), but Thai Style Noodle House hit the spot for me and my group. As I said before, I'll be back for that duck fried rice, and hopefully my phone won't be dead that time!",

Had a very decent papaya salad that time and was craving Mongolian beef today. So badly. Tender, juicy, saucy beef. I ordered with extra veggies and no rice.   What I got was the TOUGHEST chunks of old beef and 2 pieces of small broccoli plus a ton of onions. I guess those are my \"extra veggies\" instead of rice. The beef is so disgusting and old. It tasted OLD and it is extremely chewy.   I cannot believe that this is ok to sell to people. This kind of beef cut is intended for long, 12 hr stews, not flash fry.   I will never waste money here again. I've been fed old, cheap and gross tasting meat. Please mail my $10. Thank you.  I am having issues with adding photos.",

I waited and waited 10 mins went by and my order still wasn't ready. There weren't very busy about 7 customers dining in. Every time I tried to get her attention to ask about the order she would go to the back. 10 more minutes pass and my order was finally ready. She handed me the food and quickly turned to walk to the register to help a guest leaving. No apology or anything. The pork belly was burnt and cold by the time we got to attempt to enjoy our food. The fried chicken had no meat on it because it seemed to be over fried. We also order Chow Mein and that was okay. Only food worth 5 stars was the N.H. Style Pot Stickers.

Pad Kee Mao without a black sauce - it was basically fried thick noodles and it was such a letdown. I was wondering if they just had a bad cook that day or just absolutely had no idea how to cook this.  The service was just ok. There were 2 waitresses the day I was eating here.

My favorite here are the vegetarian egg rolls.  It seems a bit plain but they are really on point! Crispy on the outside warm and delicious vegetable inside.

Good amount of flavor, but slightly bland. I ordered the green curry and it was probably one of the worst I have ordered in LV. The green beans are a strange add, I picked those out. They didn't go with the dish at all in my opinion. Not much chicken- definitely jipped on that. They also add way too many in the curry AND papaya salad- I don't think they belonged in either dish.   Overall, flavors were bland and nothing stood out. We won't be back.",

The name of the restaurant is kinda funny because it's SO clear and it might help the drunk bastard tourists jonesing for a Thai.  I ordered Pad See Ew, Tom Kha Khai soup, and my partner got the Pad Thai (the most adventurous and daring choice of them all). You can choose the spice level of your noodles which might be puzzling because it's between 1-10 and a little description of each level would be helpful. The refreshing Tom Kha Khai soup selection was interesting because this tangy potion is typically served in a big silver pot complete with flames but you can also order it by the bowl which I did.   There's also this interesting mural on their wall that is Vegas-themed. The place is affordable but seating is limited.",

If you are visiting Vegas and craving Asian food I would definitely recommend you to try Thai Style Noodle House! Their prices are also extremely reasonable! And another great thing is that the restaurant has a location literally down the street from the Strip! So its a perfect place to go to when you want to have a quiet lunch away from the crowded life on the Strip!   Their restaurant is small and can get busy during peak lunch or dinner hours! But I can assure you the wait is well worth it! During my visit we ordered a variety of dishes: Crab fried rice, pad thai, pad sae mau, thai beef salad, and yellow curry.  All the dishes were spicy and yummy. Their food was seasoned extremely well! But my ultimate favorite dish was their yellow curry!!! I don't really like curry, but their curry was absolutely delicious. The consistency of their curry was not too watery or thick, it was just right! Their coconut flavor did not over power the curry. And their spiciness level was on point.  If you're heading to Vegas for vacation! You should definitely stop here and give it a try! Its definitely worth it and you won't regret your decision :)",

Took my friend who was visiting from Cali here for a quick bite, since I thought the food quality would be the same but I guess I was wrong. I ordered the BBQ pork wonton soup and the wontons had a sour taste to them which were not mild, and made me think they may be expired. Broth was extremely red, probably due to the BBQ pork coloring, but at the other locations the broth is always brown and if anything, a hint of red; never would the entire soup be overpowered with a red color...In addition, the papaya salad was made with ripened papaya. When I say this, I mean that the papaya salad came out orange, instead of the bright green color. No it was not from the fish sauce, or because it may have been made laos style, it was because the papaya was ripe. It made the salad have a different soft texture and also added a sweet flavor to it which was not like the usual Thai style green papaya salad. Only time the waiter came by was to take our order, drop the food off, and give the check. No water refills or checking to see how the food was, probably because they didn't care and I could see it in the quality of the dishes.",

    "text": "This is one of our \"go-to\" spots for Thai food, and it's centrally located so when the lunch crew is out at various spots we can all meet here. The restaurant itself is not very spacious yet it get packed fairly quickly at lunch time. Thus if you have a rather large group there could be a problem, also if you have small rambunctious rug rats there isn't a whole lot of room and things for them to do. The food has always been excellent. I recommend the chicken noodle soup with thin noodles or the chicken pad thai.  THE MOST ANNOYING thing of this particular restaurant is that they have a Lunch SPECIALS MENU but never say anything and don't tell you about it. They keep it hidden and you have to ask for it every time and when you do they seem upset you asked. It's as if they make commission on lunch sales or something. It make me feel like they would rather have you pay full price for your meal.   I don't know if they read these reviews, but here's an idea, include your lunch special menu into you main menu, like every other place, it's good advertisement to get your dinner crowds to come in at lunch time.",

Anyways great place whether you're a local or a tourist and need some good cheap Thai food! Haha oh and I think there's a boba shop next door",

    "text": "You need to try this place at least once.  Cheap and delicious, with arguably the best curry I've ever tasted (and I've been to Thailand). THIS IS THE BRANCH TO GO TO-- DO NOT GO TO THE ONE ON FORT APACHE. While the one on Fort Apache is the same owner, it's not the same chef and the food DOES NOT taste the same. This is the original branch and the cooking is SUPERIOR.  This is a hole in the wall Thai restaurant that's authentic to the point you can see a Thai grandma in the kitchen whipping up your dishes. Everything is so frigging cheap ($5-7 a plate) so I recommend you come with friends so you can eat family style and try a little bit of everything.   The interior of the restaurant is ghetto, so ghetto that I have to warn people ahead of time and assure them that the food is worth it. This is a place you come strictly for flavor.  Things to order: Duck curry - slices of duck in a red curry served with a side of white rice. Delicious. Amazing. This dish makes me so sad I live in Los Angeles. The curry is rich and flavorful, the slices of duck are juicy and tender, and it all just melts so well in your mouth. It's a mouthgasm.  The pineapple fried rice- HUGE chunks of pineapple and whatever meat you choose (I like chicken with this dish). It's prepared correctly in that the rice isn't dry. This dish has nuts in it so if you're allergic, beware.  The pad see ew - It's a bit sweeter here than in other places, but I prefer that. I choose beef. Once again, it's done well.  The pad thai - Delicious.  Get my drift? Parking is plentiful, and the service is just fine (cute thai ladies who can't speak English well)  Honestly, just call ahead and pick up your order so you can skip the crowd. You need to try this place. A+++++",

I'm a regular at the Fort Apache location, but on the few occasions I have been here, the service was lackluster and the food was meh.   After my most recent visit, I can say I will definitely not be back. My fella and I came by late one night when I was craving some noodles. My fella suggested Fuku Burger, but I was adament about my noodle craving so we ended up here. I ordered the spicy noodle and my fella got the duck fried rice. I also ordered a Thai tea for good measure. The tea was overly sweet and way too creamy. I handed that to my fella to finish. Next came our noodles. They weren't nearly as spicy and the texture was a little slimey. I wasn't a fan of that. My fella's fried rice was dry and really lacked flavor.   To top off a very blah meal, we saw a roach wandering up the wall towards our table. EEEK! I've never jumped up so fast in my life. We quickly headed to the register. Pointed out our discovery to the waitress, paid our bill and left. I really didn't want to stay any longer than I needed to. I have a serious aversion to bugs.  I have to say that there were quite a few bugs outside in the parking lot, so I assume our little friend wandered in through the door, but still. Ew. I'll definitely stick to the other Thai Style Noodle House from now on.",

    "text": "Not a local.. first time here at this Thai restaurant. I was craving some type of soup and decided to get some Thai food. Their combination beef soup was really good. I prefer my soup spicy so I had to mix all the chili sauces together to get more flavor from my dish. (Just a personal preference.) What's nice about the noodles is that you get to choose the type of Noodle you want. Whether you want the fat noodles, small rice noodles, vermicelli noodles, or egg noodles. My fiance ordered their beef Thai fried rice and it wasn't too bad. It's not like the Thai fried rice we have had at other Thai restaurants. Everything on their menu sounds appetizing! What's best is that because it's so small... you know they're making it when you place the order.   This is a small family owned business and the service they provide is pretty amazing. They don't check on you to see if there's anything else you need but they're attentive when you're looking for someone to assist you or need something.   Their price point is pretty affordable. Obviously comparing the price with Thai restaurants on the strip is pretty outrageous but compared to Thai town in Hollywood, CA it's pretty inexpensive. Our bill for those two items was only $15.04... a pretty good bargain if you ask me! Especially since the food was good..   Can't go wrong with anything on this menu! Definitely recommend and would be back when we're back in town!",

    "text": "One thing I will give this place is the prices of their food. Their normal entrees of Thai staples like fried rice, pad thai, and pad see ew were pretty decently priced. For the price, the portions weren't too bad at all. For the taste and the service, it's a little bit iffy.  When I received my order of pad thai, the thing I noticed was a good third of my plate was occupied by bean sprouts and the rest of noodles. They have this illusion that you got a lot of food, when all you got was an average amount. I did not really like how they did that, but it was $6.95, what's there to complain about? The taste of the pad thai was how you expect it to taste, so nothing funky there. When the pad see ew came, a lot more food looked present than in the pad thai. That was a very good sign to me! But the bad thing was that it had a funky after taste that I'm not use to. It's not the typical taste that I have had at other places, and the aftertaste wasn't a good aftertaste either. I don't know if that's how they normally make it or it was just that day, but I didn't like it too much. The fried rice that my friends ordered though, especially the fried chicken fried rice looked pretty epic... I should have gotten that, had I known how much they would give for that. Well, their portions were good, but it didn't really make up for the service that bothered me a little bit.   The waitresses were nice and served us appropriately. They took our orders in a timely fashion and refilled our waters before it hit the bottom of the glass, but the thing that bothered me was that they rushed our party a little bit toward the end of our meal. This particular location is a little small, and so larger parties are going to have a hard time being seated. My party consisted of 6 and we had a little trouble being seated. When another party came in that was 6 as well, they kind if made it a point they wanted us out to sit the next people. I understand it's a business and they want to make money, but you shouldn't shoo away the customers that you have for the next set. That's fairly rude if you ask me. So after a bit, my friends finished eating and we headed out.   I won't be coming back here under my own choosing. I'm not really big on the service, or the taste of the Thai food, but it's decently cheap for the portions they give you and so if you want value, I will recommend this place, but not so much on taste & service.",

Heres why:  - Tom Yum - the best frickin tom yum I have EVER had. - Pad Thai - was delish - Curry - traditional and new wave selections, and very good! - Thai Iced Tea - not only is it very good, but they offer an XL size for the inner fat kid. - Price - SPOT ON. Where I would normally spend $30-40 on the same meal (my girlfriend and I always get the same items the first time we try a new place), this place cost $23. This allowed me to tip the waitress with more than what she deserved. Everyone is happy :) -The 'ramen' (it was not called ramen here) was also very good, the broths are savory and the meat included is perfect for the amount of soup/noodle/veggie.  The choices are interesting: duck, salmon, many different traditional thai dishes and flavors prove that a one time dining experience will leave you craving the sequel.",

Order was completely wrong so I contacted Eat24 and they contacted the restaurant, restaurant had agreed to make the correct order and send it with a delivery driver. After waiting for about an hour with no delivery in sight I went ahead and called Eat24 yet again again and spoke to a lovely lady named Paige who has been has been helping me out The Whole time. I informed her that my reorder has not yet arrived so she placed me on a brief hold to re contact the restaurant. She then got back on the line with me and told me the restaurant is refusing to make me the correct order. I told her to go ahead and let them know to come and pick up their food and bring me back my money. She told me that if I wanted a refund then I would have to go in store and get the refund that way. So that is what my husband is doing. Oh by the way they have extremely rude and horrible on phone customer service skills. In my opinion I would think twice before ordering takeout from this restaurant. I hope you all find this information helpful.",

Instead of seating us first, the server there decided the group of six was more important than my group and sat them immediately. Keep in mind that group did not have a reservation, nor did anyone of their party came in before us . My group and I stood there in appalled as he sat everyone and completely ignore my party even when we had been standing in front of the waiting line the entire time. We asked why the group that came LAST got seated first, and all the sever could say was that he will take care of us later. He offered no explanation or apology as to why he chose to sit that group first when we have been waiting for 15 min patiently. What kind of BS is that? This is no way to run a business.",

My bf has never tried Thai food (this kid doesn't like vegetables OR spice) so it took a bit of coercing, but luckily in the end he really loved it.   I'm totally down with any restaurant that has an extra complete vegan/vegetarian menu, so they get an extra star just for that.   I got the spicy thai basil and asked for extra carrots and it didn't seem to have much more, but the dish was good nonetheless. Yummy sauce.  My bf got the jung pao tofu and the sauce was incredible. Luckily he doesn't like onions so I ate them all and even snuck in a piece of tofu that was really yummy.   For dessert I usually get mangoes with sticky rice, but this time we went for the fried bananas; a little too greasy for my taste, but wonderfully paired with the ice cream and honey.  I would go here again and I would recommend it to someone who wanted chinese/thai that was cheap and off the strip.",

The goal is to get to 10 and see if I can handle the heat. My new favorite is the Tom Yum Soup with Chicken and wide noodles. Nice cozy place and more than one location which is always a good thing. The prices are fair and the portions are generous. I am Thai foodie and I've eaten at some of the best Thai restaurants from Los Angeles to San Francisco and I will say this place is at the top of the list. Oh, don't forget when you order the shrimp fried rice, make it Thai Hot. The heat in Thai food is what makes it so great!",

All their food was fresh, full of flavor and they gave you enough food to satisfy for a nice price. This was one of the best meals I've had in Vegas! I HIGHLY recommend this place.

I lived in Seattle, WA and would come to Vegas once per week as I own my business here...I found this little gem about 2 years ago and have frequented every week since!  We moved our main residence here and this was the first place we ate!  The ingredients are super fresh, authentic, and blended very well too.  All of their meat is marinated, sauted and of super high quailty.  Talk about super nice people too-:)  The girls that are at the front treat you like family..(i am a simple white guy) and they intro'd me to their entire family.  When my wife came in they intro'd her as well and took pictures of our kids.  The place is always jam packed.  I love Thai and travel quite a bit.  I take all my friends here and never a complaint and they always come back and check in.  Best Thai from Seattle to LA and here!",

We initially tried to go to Lotus of Siam, which is our favorite, but didn't want to wait 45 minutes to eat so we kept going to Thai Noodle. The location is small with maybe ten tables or so. Service is good. I had the Panang salmon avocado which came with rice, I think it was around $10. Ordered it medium spicy, which was really not spicy for me, but it was delicious. I wouldn't initially think hot avocado as something I would like but it works really well in this dish.  I love that they give you a lot of sauce to because I like soaking the sauce up with the rice. Also, the salmon was a pretty decent size, 3 pieces maybe 1 1/2 inches by 3 inches or so, I was very full by the time we were done. We also had the combo appetizer platter, the satay was good and the food on the app was tasty but most of it was fried so I probably would opt for the pot stickers next time. If you are looking for a good Lotus alternative I would definitely keep this in mind.",

We found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to leave our hotel at the MGM Grand for something new and less expensive.  I would have given this restaurant a 5 star if it weren't for the strange smell upon walking into the restaurant.  It may have been a spice or food related.  However, the food was excellent!  I had mongolian beef with rice and loved it.  My parents had the same and gave it a thumbs up as well.  Three others had variations of the pad thai noodles and said their food was really good. I recommend this place for good eating and saving money.  It's not fancy so don't go in expecting something formal.  The waitresses were attentive and the service was excellent.  The store front and restaurant itself are small.  But sometimes the best places are really the hole in the wall places like this restaurant.",

Tucked on a corner of Chinatown's shops, facing westside. Thai effervescence in the air will get you the hunger pangs. A photo menu book to aid your menu choices selection. Waitstaff attentive in service. My favorite is Yellow Curry with Pumpkin, Mixed Vegetables and Salmon made special order...request granted! with saucy flavor of coconut milk. Still affordable despite the additions to the order. Other variations of Salmon dish choices I try each time I visit. \"Pad Thai\" and \"Hoi-Tod\" (fried pancake with green mussels) is yummy. Spicy taste will add to the experience. Request the spicy hotness according to your \"bravery\". Thai cuisine lover or not, a good taste of spice!",
