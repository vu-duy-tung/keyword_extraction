    "text": "I went to Reb Robin on Friday (Veterans Day observed) and say they had the \"Table Set for One\" on display for customers to observe. I thought that was very heartwarming given the Holiday and I love how they included that touch to honor Veterans. On top of that the service the waitress provided was exceptional. Unfortunately I cannot remember her name but she was the nicest lady who did her best to ensure we felt comfortable and had everything we needed. When the food came it was exactly how we ordered and fresh off the grill. Amazing service, great food, and they honored our veterans.. what more can you ask for? Great job Red Robin!",

    "text": "Meh. The fries were very good. It's supposed to be unlimited but you will be hard pressed to be able to have them come fill up your glass with a second cup of water. So the unlimited fries is basically 1 refill because they take forever to refill, as in 20-30 minutes. The little red blinking light to summon your server is a farce. I turned it off after 15-20 minutes.  Burgers are ok. We all ordered pink in the middle since the waiter asked. No one in our group of 3 received it pink. I got the BBQ burger which was made of bacon, patty, and some other accoutrements I can't think of. Pretty much every burger had bacon in it. Bacon is usually a filler when they cannot make it tasty using other ingredients IMO. I think avocado, or grilled onions would've made this gourmet-ish but bacon is just meh for me. Five guys burger is tastier is the verdict.  I would say the server sucked but he was busy serving others and not standing around so I am going to assume the Galleria Mall RR is understaffed due to personnel shortfalls.",

Reasons why as follows:  1. 15 minutes before the waitress (Lisa) took our drink order. 2. 20 minutes before she brought them back and took our food order. 3. After an additional 20 minutes we flagged down a passing hostess to ask her to get our waitress. 4. 10 minutes later....no Lisa, so we left. 5. The manager did chase us down when we were almost to Macy's but it was too little too late.",

For a place that stays pretty busy, there is no excuse for cold food being brought to the table. And when I let the waitress know about it she didn't apologize, she just took it to the back and 15 minutes later brought out another batch which of course arrived after we had ate almost everything else.   2 Stars. Every time I step foot in this particular location it's been a bad experience and not up to the standards I've experienced at other Red Robin locations here in Las Vegas, Colorado, and Missouri.",

So glad they dont look down on you or give you worse service for cashing in on a free birthday burger offer.   2 star missing because the burger came out warm. I mean the burger had no sizzle or steam. ive had fast food burgers hotter than that thing. They offer endless fries but offer about 12 with the entree. Necessitating my request for another round of 12 fries. It seems silly to be honest. Put enough on the first plate so I dont have to ask for more. Jeez oh man.

I was happy to see they didn't drown my plate in French fries like a lot of other places do. Their raspberry limeade was top notch and was almost tempted to order another just do I could take it home.  Their pretzel bites were typical of any other place that serves soft pretzels.

    "text": "It's changed a lot since the first time I went a long while ago at least to this location, wayyyyy before I started yelping.   I guess they're trying to class it up a bit? The burgers and fries used to come in baskets but now they come on a plate which is cool but it's whatever to me. They'll still always be the same in my mind! But really we're here for the food....or at least some of us are.  I decided to try the guacamole burger, minus the bacon (I don't do bacon, sorry!), and substituted mayo for chipotle aioli sauce and the regular burger for a gardein burger. So the subbing the burger for a vegetarian or vegan (they got those too) option was no charge....subbing the mayo for chipotle aioli was $0.50, it would be no big deal if there was actual sauce and if they asked me if it was okay/told me there would be a charge for subbing it. I tasted practically nothing but saw a smudge on the bottom of the burger. I'm not too happy about that. Not to mention the guacamole was a puree and well you could hardly tell it was there either. So this burger was a big bust for me and a serious disappointment.   Bottomless steak fries? I can always go for fries! They tasted the same as I always remembered. Nothing too special about them, I like it with a little bit more of their seasoning so thankfully they leave a bottle of that on the tables!   I rarely get dessert while I'm out eating dinner because I always over stuff myself, but this time I decided to treat myself and wished I didn't.  I got a the red velvet cake. Normally you get a rich cream cheese icing with a moist cake. Well I got a dried cake that tasted like it was a couple days old not to mention left out all day and the rich cream cheese icing tasted nothing like cream cheese icing that I know. So I was doubly disappointed.  They also ran out of all the seasonal taps that night but had one IPA on tap that I decided to try. It had a goose on it, I forgot the name, but I liked it. Nothing too special about this beer though.   I'm not a fan of being sat at by the bar, but that's where they put me and so I dealt with it. Next time I'm going to the Eastern location even if it's a bit farther from me. I think I'm a bit too disappointed with this visit to go back here.",

I was greeted with a very nonchalantly \"Hey buddy\" which in my opinion is not the best way to greet a customer. Didn't introduce himself, when I asked him a question after ordering our food and he kept walking away as he vaguely answered my question. I'm still here, almost done with my burger and hasn't been back once to check on my table. The guy definitely has potential to be a good server but didn't make a very good first impression. I'm definitely coming back and hopefully my next review will be 5 stars. Thanks!",

After eating the dry over cooked burger the manager came to our table and asked us to pay our bill (as if to say-- you are going to pay).

The bartender didn't start out very friendly however as we continued to sit there he warmed up to us.  He asked if I wanted a single or a double and I asked how much the double was which seemed to stump him.  Interesting.  Then under his breath behind the bar he was on his phone and said something along the lines of, \"My god.  Where is my sister?  I'm going to smack her\".  Probably not something you want to say in ear shot of your guests.  The drinks were priced OK, a double Jack & Coke was $10.

I patiently waited to consume my burger until I was brought another knife and by then my friend had already eaten half of her side salad. In total, we waited about 30 min through out lunch for our waiter to tend to our needs, some of which were fulfilled by other people.

Red Robin is American-style food at its finest. The place has an upbeat, colorful atmosphere, along with a few arcade games. The menu is pretty diverse, and it's highly unlike you'll be coming here and not finding something that appeals to you. They even have shakes/malts, and I guarantee they will be some of the finest you have ever tasted. The place has excellent fries, and with pretty much any food item you paid for you get an unlimited supply during your meal. Not bad for all the people that can't get enough food.  The service tends to be a bit hit-and-miss at times. Sometimes I have gone for minutes on end with no one coming to me. During one visit I didn't even get my malt until after I had received my food! Plus, they are terrible at taking the request of not including ranch with your chicken fingers - and this IS a big deal, considering it is an unsealed container and CAN spill out onto them.  Still, the faults are minor in the long run. I've been going to this place since they opened up here, and probably always will. Nothing is so wrong with this place that it will keep me away. I have to give this place a strong recommendation overall.",

I asked her what was going on she said she didn't know all that she knew was that the kitchen was backed up. so no explanation as we just sat there and continue to wait.  no manager ever came to apologize or ask us if we were okay, we also watched three different tables walk out. our food finally got there after 40 minutes but it was just me my sister and my mom's food, still no kids meals!!! we said that this was unacceptable and we asked to have our kids meals and why they were not there. a girl came by and said to Irene it was never put in, the kitchen had no ticket for it. finally the other girl ran back to the kitchen and got our kids meals after another 10 minutes. we still were missing one of the sides with the kids meals and it also never came. all of our food was cold it was awful but we still ate it because we were so hungry and had waited so long. finally we got the bill because we just wanted to get out of there and nothing had been discounted or taken off for all that we had been put through. so I asked for the kids meals to be removed, which they did and it took 12 dollars off of our bill. not to mention that the place was pretty dirty and it seemed like nobody really cared. We also watched one of the male servers walk by and wipe his nose with his hand like he had a cold, at that point I put my burger down and was done eating. I am a former server myself I have done this my whole life and never have I been the type to complain but this was the worst thing that we have ever seen in a restaurant and the lack of people to care. usually a manager comes over and tries to reassure the table or will give you some type of comp or let you know that they care and this did not even happen. never have we been so disappointed. I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone. the staff was awful the food was awful and the place is dirty.",

Having been a customer here on countless occasions I would say the 95% of my visits here have meet my expectations and 5% were a little under. As I have said in a few of my other reviews everywhere has its off days.  Being a frequent customer here I walk in knowing what I am gonna get. I always sit down order my drink and a few baskets of their BOTTOMLESS Steak Fries which come with any burger order. I almost never order an appetizer but when I do they are a taste treat :) I have tried 90% of the burgers on the menu and my all time favorite is the Bruschetta Chicken Burger. The Garlic Fries are a great addition to the plate and the burger itself is amazing. Another good choice is the Royal Red Robin Burger. I love eating here the price is right and I always leave stuffed of what I was expecting!",

We told the hostess it was my daughter's birthday, we told the server it was our daughter's birthday, he asked for our rewards card - we gave them the number it was tied to and the birthday was registered in the system.  We had a nice dinner and when the check came he said you had a coupon for $5 and leaves.  We paid the bill and we hung out at the table for another 10-15 mins, no birthday singing.  THAT WAS THE WHOLE REASON WE WENT THERE, rather than grabbing a cheap buffet.  My daughter was so bummed.",

The first time I ate at a Red Robin was in Florida and there wasn't anything really memorable about it, so I wasn't expecting much of this visit.   The hostess was emotionless and couldn't seem to get the number in our party right...we had to switch tables. Our server, luckily, was very cheerful.   My salad could have used more walnuts and the kids meals my niece and nephew got seemed a little dry. I'm not sure what my brother and his fiance thought of their burgers.   Prices are good so it's a good place to go if you have a family. I had fun playing the activities on the kids menu with my niece and nephew.",

When the waitress noticed at we were not eating the slaw, she offered to bring us fries.  This was nice. They were okay, not great. I wasn't happy that when I held the burger and noticed that the bread was cold.  Toasting or warming the bun should be customary, otherwise, why am I buying a burger when I can make a better one at home?  Good thing that the bill was less than $30.  We will not come again.

By this point we had already made it to the restaurant so decided to just go in and place the order. It was pretty simple. 1 avo-cobo salad. After a 40 minute wait we finally got the salad (which had been sitting for awhile). So of course we spoke with the manager who in turn gave us an apology and a $20 gift card. Mind you, we'd already paid for the salad ($11.77) so it wasn't much of a GIFT considering it wouldn't even cover the cost of a new salad after the difference. Nonetheless, we were happy with the offer and went home to eat. Opened the salad... And the lettuce was wilted and filled with water in the bottom of the container. I called back in to speak with the manager who was kind enough to put in a rush order for not only 1 but 2 new salads and said to still keep the gift card. Thanks, Jim! The only decent part about our red robin experience was the manager who did his best to remedy the issue.",

We ate here yesterday, ironically using a gift card given to us a few months back by the manager due to horrible service that time. It doesn't seem to be any one thing that goes wrong - there is a just a general sense of this restaurant never being organized. If the service is speedy, the kitchen is slow. If the kitchen is fast, the food runners let food sit in the window. Or some combo thereof. The food is decent for a chain burger joint and we like the flexibility of the veggie burgers since we don't eat meat. However, Red Robin isn't the only place we can get a veggie burger. I really wish this restaurant could get everything together!",

Our waitress was not very friendly and didn't say much and instead just stood by our table looking at us.  When she did speak she mumbled and was hard to hear.  We ordered the soft pretzels to start which took awhile to come out and then had a funny taste to them.  Our food took awhile to come out as well.  I had the new Smoke & Pepper burger.  The lettuce on the burger tasted like it wasn't washed and the fries were cold.  I ordered the herb garlic fries which were not worth the money.  My husband ordered the onion rings and they were falling apart in his hand, to the point where he couldn't dip them in any sauce.  Our waitress didn't come back to the table to see how the food was and our water glasses sat empty for awhile.  Once we had paid the bill I went to the restroom and  discovered someone had SHIT ON THE FLOOR of one of the stalls.  Never again will I return to this establishment!",

Tables need to be cleaned food on the floor.   My order was not complicated. I ordered a regular cheeseburger, fries, ice tea and a Caesar salad.   my server was Sonny which she had no clue as to what she was  doing. Very overwhelmed. She brought my food after awhile and never brought my Caesar salad. Instead she brought me Cesar dressing which I just don't understand. I had asked for some utensils she said there in the dishwasher soon as they come up she'll bring me silverware Which never happened.   They must've been short handed you might think. Well this place has been so inconsistent and  turnover in management and staff. I should have known better. The food was  terrible. The manger came to my table and was also clueless and not professional at all. This Red Robin should close down before someone seriously gets food poisoning. There were other tables concerned about the service as well. Go at your own risk. I really believe that this manager doesn't know how to take control of this operation and showed no concern for the situation. If this is a franchise go Roll up your sleeves and get in there and fix it you should be ashamed of yourself. If it's a corporate store even worse get someone in there that knows what they're doing. The Community of Henderson has seen enough of the quality that you've been Serving there. you should be completely ashamed of yourselves.",

All of the staff looked completely stressed out! They only had the front area of tables open, they weren't seating in the other areas of the restaurant.

This place is OK if you want convenience in the mall and if you keep your expectations low. I've got no problem with the burgers, but you're rolling the dice with service.  After a five minute wait to be sat on a Saturday night around 7 PM, we had about a five minute greet after being sat in the bar area and the service seemed to be a step behind for the rest of the meal especially with order delivery and refills. The burger selection, which they group into three categories, is actually pretty large: gourmet, finest, and tavern. There are also salads, $3, $5, $7, and $9 apps, chicken entrees, and soups.  We kept it pretty simple ordering the Tavern Double for my wife, the Sauteed Shroom burger for me, and sharing regular fries. I can't complain about my burger, ordering with pink, it was juicy with healthy serving of mushrooms and melted Swiss cheese on the burger. The fries were sufficient. I have had most of the gourmet burgers and they're all good depending if you have a craving. The Chili Chili Cheeseburger is a combination on a burger that I like that is isn't offered in a lot of places.  I swiped my credit card at the table and paid. After I asked my wife if she wanted me to pull the car around to pick her up, she declined and braved the 47 degree weather trek in the tundra to the  car. I see us coming back as a tertiary option or if we want a burger and don't want to leave the mall.",

    "text": "I said I would've given it four stars last year if not for the fries. Well, I figured out a fix for the fries.  Went back to Red Robin for my birthday again. As I said before, sign up for their rewards program (Red Robin Royalty) and they'll load a free burger onto your account annually during your birth month. You'll hardly have to buy your own food if you find enough places like this.  Anyway, the fries thing. I asked for them to cook 'em longer on both occasions. It didn't work perfectly the first time (only a little better than the standard cook), but the bottomless steak fries definitely came out golden brown with mostly crunchy potato pieces on the second attempt. This batch was almost everything you want from fries. They're underseasoned, but just add sufficient amounts of ketchup and the Red Robin Seasoning (salt, pepper, paprika, other various spices) and you'll be fine. Or you can do with the salt and pepper grinders if that's your thing.  (UPDATE 11/7/17: You can just say \"extra crispy\" to order the fries this way. I also suggest checking inside the menu for 5 complimentary sauces which you can request on the side. The \"Secret Tavern\" sauce is that creamy light-orange stuff that you'll often find everywhere by different names.)  The burger was good too. This year, I went for the Whiskey River BBQ Burger (normally $10.69) with ciabatta. I listened more closely this year and realized that the server told me that my options were \"no pink\" or \"a little pink.\" This gave me more realistic expectations for the meat color, and I'd say that the patty was indeed \"a little\" pink. The ciabatta was a nice, sturdy alternative to the standard bun. The burger overall was a sweet and savory treat with the namesake BBQ sauce, crispy onion straws, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo. I might consider asking for it again without mayo since that dulled the BBQ sauce's flavor a bit.  Service felt a bit sluggish with my order taking longer to start than I thought it should've, compounded by server confusion. The host didn't explain upon seating me at the bar (not my request) that I'd be ordering with the bartender-esque server, and that server didn't really introduce herself and/or explain that she'd be taking my order. I guess it wasn't so bad because the place was pretty packed at about an hour past peak lunch.  After I finally got in the order, things ran smoothly enough. Well, aside from the air vent expelling cold air directly onto me, but I was fine in my jacket. Your mileage may vary.  As I said before, I'll be back here or at another Red Robin every year. It's not a premium burger, but it's solid casual dining and it's fantastic when it's free.  (UPDATE 12/10/15: fried mushroom app is decent, fried mozzarella stick app is very average, and #NameThatChicken burger might not even be as good as some of McDonald's \"premium\" chicken sandwiches. But at least the burger was free to people with names similar to Saint Nick or Kris Kringle. Hooray, promos!)",

Then someone walked by and asked me my name in passing and said she'd pack up my food and be right back. Then I waited for 15 more minutes.  I wasn't early to pick up my food. I received it 30 minutes after the time I was told it would be ready.  I checked the food when I got to the car to see if I had to stop for other food--because I didn't feel like I could trust the order--and one sandwich was wrong and the food was room temperature and soggy.  :( :( :(",

My burger was tasty as were the fries.  My kids had the pizza and grilled cheese, I had just a regular burger and a drink and our total was about $20.  Not too bad especially when you are comparing it to fast food.  Our server was spot on, filling my drink when it was only half empty.  She did forget my boys chocolate milk and accidently gave it to the table next to us but stuff like this happens and I overlooked it.    I am however deducting two stars for them having a military discount and taking it away.  Really?!  You can't afford to give the few military who may come into this restaurant a few bucks off their bill.  This really left a bad taste in my mouth.

After settling on Red Robin, we walked in to be greeted promptly. The hostess than had us wait a few minutes as she walked away, which I assumed was to clean a table. Needless to say, she returns and takes us in the opposite direction and attempts to seat us at a dirty table. She quickly noticed it wasn't clean and took us to another.... Which was dirty as well! WTF.... Clean the damn tables please. So we stand there awkwardly as she heads to find someone to clean it. I look around the corner and there is a dining area of about 15 tables that are all empty. I have worked in restaurants and know that the section was already closed and detailed but why keep us hovering awkwardly. Finally someone, who I guess was the manager comes and wipes down the table but leaves it much too wet. She tells us she will be right back to dry it off. At this point I am irritated, and not one person has yet to apologize. We sit finally and immediately notice how disgusting the floor is. That shit hasn't been swept in months it seems! Food, napkins, utensils and everything in between. I was horrified at this point and after waiting another 5 minutes for a server just got up and left.  What a nightmare this place is!! I wish I could give it negative stars. I will literally never again dine in any Red Robin again in my life. This place is a joke",

    "text": "Had a bit of a hiatus from writing reviews.  Needed to clear my head a bit because as you know this is very important and soul crushing work.  Well so begins review-a-thon 2012!  I've been to this Red Robin several times over the years, back in the day it was a regular stop on Galleria Mall shopping trips.  Since the Internet has nearly completely taken over my life and I don't have a need for such a thing as a \"shopping mall\" I rarely find myself there anymore.  Somehow, someway it's become a meeting place for a group of friends of mine lately when we've all been in that area, so here goes:  I've got to say that years ago Red Robin was probably my favorite Burger joint in Las Vegas with the exception of In N Out.   At that point all that I really knew was fast food burgers, so RR was always a breath of fresh air from those.   Well times have changed, and much like my Motorola RAZR in comparison to my iPhone, RR's burgers have taken a backseat to newer, sexier models of burger that I can get from places like Bachi, Fuku, or one of the 50 burger places that opened in the last 12 hours.    That being said, Robin still puts out a decent quality product for my money.  The beer is cold, the ingredients usually taste fresh, service is generally friendly and I'd be remiss not to mention the bottomless steak fries that you get with every order.  My favorite is probably the Burnin Love because jalapenos and burgers are one of my preferred combinations.    Ultimately I wouldn't recommend seeking out a Red Robin if you're craving a burger and are near one of the Bachi locations or even an In N Out, but if you find yourself trapped in the Build a Bear Workshop, Hot Topic, Abercrombie and Fitch or some other shopping mall clone at the Galleria one day and you don't feel like Sbarro, Red Robin might be worth a go.",

    "text": "So I actually have two reviews for this place and both are bad. I went in with my daughter (a 2 year old) and received some of the worst service of my life. Then for a $20 bill they charged my card $50. When I call the manager they took care of it and said they would send coupons which I never got.  My family and I tried eating there again yesterday afternoon. The service was horrible again. No refills on drinks and we didn't even get silver wear.  We ordered my daughter grilled chicken and apple slices.  The chicken they server my 2 year old was raw inside. This is completely unexpectable. I would not recommend this place to anyone and be very careful what you eat there",

I prefer the one on Centennial-they are always accommodating and friendly, our food is always right and the staff is friendlier.",

I always used to order the blue ribbon burger.. so good! but in later years I've been trying to behave and have ordered the cobb salad here 2x. If you are looking for healthier options.. under 500 calories. Good luck, go somewhere else. But.... hear me out.... this place's Cobb Salad is 533 calories not counting dressing and the bread they serve with it. I love their website that counts all the calories and you can modify to calculate every single thing you put in your mouth. down to the lettuce... yes down to the lettuce. Its a must try!  Also note. if you are looking for this place its not on the outskirts of the mall it is in the mall.. The 1st time we were looking for it we didnt see it so we went to BWW. (always a winner)  But this has great burgers and other options.",

    "text": "Red Robin is and always will be a mediocre hamburger restaurant with a variety of appetizers. The entire menu is burgers, that's their thing. I guess you also have to mention they have the speckled lemonades and decent iced tea as well.   My last venture to Red Robin was because I was out with a friend in Henderson and we needed a place to grab lunch. Well, I hadn't been to Red Robin in awhile so we figured hey why not.  We arrived a bit after lunchtime so the place was pretty dead. We were seated fairly promptly and the service was good. Our waiter didn't mess up our order, he checked up on us, etc.   I ordered a chicken sandwich. Honestly I can't even remember the name, but it was of the grilled variety. The only thing I can really say about it is I did not enjoy the super white breaded bun it came on. I just think I've become used to better slices of bread. I've become spoiled by other places I suppose. My friend ordered a chicken sandwich as well and I believe hers had some pineapples on it.   Their large steak fries were tasty and add a bit of variety to the meal. The waiter also asked us if we would like certain types of sauces to dip the fries in, which was nice of him.  Overall the food was okay, the service was very nice and competent, the restaurant was clean, and so was the bathroom. They do have a bar at the back of this location. I didn't realize that came standard with Red Robin, but hey, it does.  Would I be back? Hmmm. Possibly. But there are a lot of better places to get a burger in Vegas.",

The only reason it has two stars is because the food was great. The service however was atrocious. I sat down with my friend, looked at the menu, and had plenty of time to do so. Then out came our waitress, she did not introduce herself at all. She then asked what we wanted to drink, we told her. We even told her the food order, in all hope we could leave in a good amount of time; but that was not an option. The people that came in after us were served and we were sitting there sipping and playing around with our ice cubes trying to make something out of this wait. We eventually got our food, and proceeded to eat. We finished our absolutely delicious food, and waited another 30 minutes. I felt as though we were in prison. We eventually saw our waitress and asked for our check. I think it would be safe for time sake to not go here if you don't have two hours to waste sitting in an uncomfortable chair. Hopefully this helps others!",

    "text": "I have always liked the food at Red Robin. My husband and I have been regulars at the Irvine Spectrum location for the past few years when we lived in California. So I am kind of disappointed that there are only a few locations here in Nevada.   Here are some of my favorites on the menu: 1. Creamy Artichoke & Spinach Dip: I think the best one is at CPK, but this comes in at a close second! I could eat this as a meal. 2. Clucks & Fries 3. Caesar's Chicken Wrap 4. BLTA Croissant (Bacon, Lettuce, Turkey, & Avocado) 5. Freckled Lemonade 6. Bottomless Steak Fries - of course!  What really disappointed me about this location was the service. Our server wasn't too friendly and it took her a while to finally come to our table and take our order. I ordered the Caesar's Chicken Wrap, which comes with melon and steak fries. I told her \"No melon, just fries.\" Well, apparently No melon = More melon and NO FRIES! I was disappointed when I got my order, which was delivered to us by another employee. Since our server was nowhere in sight, my husband and I just shared the fries that he got with his burger. We figured it was bottomless anyway, and would just order more if needed. Also, there were no utensils or napkins on our table so we had to ask for those as well. The Red Robin restaurants in California always gave us a set of utensils wrapped in a napkin as soon as we sat down.   The food here is great! Too bad the service is pretty horrible.",

The beer my husband wanted they ran out. He asked her what she would recommend and she didn't have too much suggestions so my husband end up having water. Then our food arrived. There was no utensils and waited for our waitress but she was no where in site so we used the device. On top of the device it was blinking red so the staff could see we needed help. We counted 10 staff members passing by looking directly at the device and did not check to see if we needed help. Our fries was cold and stale and we got our food. My husband had the Bleu Ribbon and it had a weird after taste to it. We thought it would have been the Bleu cheese. I had the BBQ whisky chicken burgers. They overloaded it with regular onions instead of string onion rings. Don't plan on going here anymore.",

Staff was friendly and efficient, place was clean, decor was nice. I've never had anything other than a burger at a Red Robin. We decided to share the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap with bottomless steak fries. I'm picky about BBQ sauce, so I was worried, but this was so good, food tasted fresh, it was the perfect melding of flavors. I was happy, I would get it again. I love when a restaurant splits the meal onto two separate plates when they know it'll be shared. Good job guys.",

Anyway, Ruben and I met up with a couple of friends on a busy Sunday afternoon. They were thoughtful enough to mention to our server that I would be looking for Vegetarian eats, so I was given the allergy binder (yeah, no information for Vegetarians, just FYI).  I ordered the Bacon Guacamole Burger with a substitution of a Gardenburger and removed the bacon and mayo. I did indulge in the bottomless fries, but was really disappointed that you're given less than ten fries to start. Seriously? I know it's unlimited, but give people a nice amount and maybe you won't have multiple orders of more fries. Our server was really great though and I asked her to bring us more as soon as we got our orders (this took a while, but like I mentioned, it was busy). I liked the Gardenburger (first time trying it, but I had done research between this and Boca Burgers; I like the idea of vegetables in a patty form rather than soy meat) and the guacamole was okay. There was barely any flavor and the vegetables were blah (the shredded lettuce was sad). The bun was all right, a tad dry. Overall, not pleased. The fries were disappointing too! I remember them being so much better too. I know they're probably just from a frozen bag, but it was not cooked well (WAY too oily) and the Red Robin Seasoning I remember enjoying was just meh too. Anyway, I thought maybe I didn't enjoy my burger since it was a \"healthy\" version, however, I took a bite of Ruben's Burnin' Love Burger and it was just okay. He, not being as picky as I am, thought everything was just okay as well.  My verdict? That was my last time dining there. Nothing phenomenal and with so many awesome burger joints in the valley, you can absolutely get something more for your money (and for just a couple dollars more).

The restaurant was completely dead and once the food was delivered our server dropped off our check and said, \"No hurry, I am not going anywhere\"  then a few minutes later came to take plates that we were still working on.  We had to tell him to chill out that we were still working on our food since we just received it!  After we were finally finished with our plates he had the nerve to ask \" did you save room for dessert?\"  I responded \"even if we did, it is too late for you because you already printed our check 20 minutes ago, so you lose\"   I could be wrong, but I thought at Red Robin, they were suppose to bring you an unlimited amount of fries?  We only received about 12 with our plates and no more!!  It was almost like the fry Nazi was working in the kitchen tonight!  Upon our exit, when I mentioned to the host who asked \"How were things?\"  I responded \"eh\"  she asked what was wrong and when I mentioned the fries as we were outside of the restaurant she responded \"would you like more fries?\"  Um kind of too late for that right? We are already on our way to our vehicle.  The food on the other hand was great!!  I like how they finally changed the menu up to get more options, I am also happy that they no long serve your food in those crazy little baskets.

Hailed as gourmet hamburgers, I took the bait hook,line and bacon. The place wasn't too crowded my waitress was very kind and attentive. I browsed over the large menu and was quite famished after not eating all day, so everything looked good. I asked the waitress for her recommendation, and ordered something similar. I believe it was the steakhouse burger or something like that. I also ordered pretzel bite appetizer to calm the hunger beast inside my stomach. The pretzel bites weren't anything to yelp home about. So there wen't 5$. The burger finally came, and looked to be pretty above average. Each burger comes with endless steak fries, which are very delicious. The burger was kinda meh.. I was expecting more razzle dazzle based on their reputation. I've experienced better and cheaper burgers at establishments that aren't even famous for their burgers. I would probably give this place another visit on free burger birthday day but otherwise they can keep it.",

    "text": "Here's a recent update:  Having returned because of a very nice manager, we were unhappily surprised by changes.  To wit:  They have now put on the tables those electronic things where you order your food (yes, I know they have them at Applebee's, and that's why we never eat there).  You use them order your appetizers, drinks and desserts.  The only thing you order from the server is your entree.  When our server showed up - after a really long time - she told us she was late because she was tired from having worked a double shift the day before.  I don't care.  Your job is to be on time, not making customers wait.  Then when I questioned her about the little kiosk, she told us everyone has them now (no, they don't) and also told us she didn't have to worry about her job because she was 'irreplaceable.'  Really?  The cemetery is full of irreplaceable people.  After we ordered, we never saw her again.  (The food was brought out by an expediter).  She never even refilled our drinks, or came over to see if the shake we ordered was any good.  So here's the bottom line:  Order appetizer from kiosk.  Order drinks (non-alcoholic) from kiosk.  Order entree from server.  Order dessert from kiosk.  Pay with a credit card at kiosk.  Practically self-service now.  Since the server is doing 1/4 of the work (3/4 being done by machine) does she deserve a full tip?  No.  Only 1/4 work deserves 1/4 tip.  If I want self-service, I'll get fast food.",

    "text": "Was craving Red Robin as it had been a few months since we had been there.    Decided to fight the shoppers at the mall and go.   Got seated right away.  This is why there is 1 star.    After that it went down hill.  The server was friendly and took our order.  We indicated what coupons we brought with us and he said no problem.    Our order comes and we are told that the Mac and Cheese we ordered was not yet ready and was still cooking.    So here we sit with everyone eating and only half the meal for one of us.   The Mac and Cheese comes out and the cheese on the top looks to be tossed on the top and the center is cold.   OK they had just said it was cooking, so why would it feel like it was freshly thawed out.  The top with the melted cheese was hot but that was the end of it.   We sent it back.   By the time the new mac and cheese comes out, the entire table is finished eating as we had shopping we needed to get to.   I asked them to put it in a to-go box.  (Yes so I can take it home and still not get to eat it hot).   Next the server comes to us and tells us that they cannot apply the coupons we brought.  Even though when placing the order we were told everything was good.  We would never have ordered the milkshake had we known that the coupon would not have been applied.  The coupon does not say anything about only 1 coupon can be used per table.  Nor did the server tell us that it could not  be done until after the milk shake was consumed.     Next we go to pay and I check my statement and see that the charge for the meal was charged twice!   I call them to let them know that they ran my card twice and I need it reversed and I get told that I have to wait 10 days and call back.   Oh did I mention that we could not even get anyone to refill the drink until we specifically had to ask if it would be refilled at the end of the meal.    Very bad service given and we were so excited to come here.",

Adequate seating for dining or for sitting at the bar. The TVs could be a little bigger. But the full bar makes up for that :-) Always a good selection of unique burger combinations. Bottomless fries are a plus. But be sure to get the garlic fries. They are the best! The servers were very professional and pleasant to work with. Mid range prices for mid-range burgers. Overall very good.",

It took for ever for the drinks from the bar to come. The food came.before the drinks, when the drinks came.thehcwhere in the wrong glasses because there wasn't enough clean glasses.  I asked the waiter why the tables where so messy, he said it was becuase they fired all the bussers and runners. If this Red Robin dosent want the health department called, they should hire a busser, I feel that the cleanliness of the restaurant will become a problem. I believe this is unfair to the server staff there becuase they are doing a great job. I would not recommend this location",

The major complaint I personally have is who ever was working the bar last night was very disrespectful and vulgar. Unprofessional for a grown working man to yell and cuss out his employee for seating him a table. If this is how the staff treat each other at a high establishment then they need to re-work their team members.

    "text": "I like Red Robin in general. They have some interesting burger options aside from the standard. I especially like their mushroom burger as it is garlic heavy and loaded with mushrooms. But I always try to get something different when I come in. Usually I get a burger but I have tried a chicken sandwich as well. One thing sticks out in my mind at this location in particular. The food doesn't seem as fresh as it should. The fries are thin and over cooked for being steak fries. And the bun, whether on a burger or a chicken sandwich, always seems to be dried out. Dried to the point of breaking and crumbling. Almost stale you could say. The over all taste of the sandwich is alright but having a disappointing bun just leaves me feeling less than satisfied. I've not noticed this at other Red Robin locations. Mostly just this one.   I will say the service I recieve once I am seated is usually pretty good. I am typically shown to the bar section to sit either at the bar or a high table. Being a single diner I suppose is the reason for that. But the person behind the bar, despite always being busy, is rather attentive. My order is taken right away and typically comes out quickly. Hard to complain about that.  I don't always end my meal with dessert but when I do, Red Robin has me covered. They have some cool alocholic desserts. Just the other night I had a root brewskie float. Alcoholic root beer poured over vanilla soft serve. I've also tried their Guiness beer shake. Any of their adult geared desserts are a fun departure from chocolate cake and ice cream. Why not end on a happy note.",

    "text": "I've been to local Red Robin's in the Bay Area and considering that it's a franchise, they make everything the same at all restaurants. Needless to say, this place isn't all that great. I can come here to eat every now and then, but it's not off the wall where I tend to want to come back more than often.  We ordered an onion ring tower which was HUGE! and ok tasting. I'm not much of a onion ring lover and that might have an impact on why I didn't think it tasted great. Me and the wifey also shared a chicken pasta which wasn't all that tasty in my opinion, probably won't ever order it again. But what I do like about this place is their fish, fries and shrimp sampler appetizer, although we didn't order it at the time we came to this place, I did have it a few times when coming to another Red Robin and I do recommend it to others when coming here.  All in all this place doesn't deserve more than 3 stars as food wasn't that great here when we ate. Sorry Red Robin I just know you can do better.",

    "text": "Terrible service.  Upon arrival we were seated and our server promptly came over to ask for our drink order.  She was very matter of fact and certainly didn't exude friendliness. When we tried to order our appetizer she was a bit snarky telling us she doesn't take appetizer orders and that we should order them ourselves off the kiosk on the table.  She attempted to show us how to order from the table then got frustrated because the machine wasn't working. She said she would be back after she activated the machine.  She walked away annoyed.  She returned, placed our app order and her demeanor was a bit nicer, she took our dinner order at this time as well.  We then proceeded to wait 40 minutes with no appetizers nor visit from the server. We were just about to walk out and go somewhere else for dinner when our meals arrived.  No appetizers just our entrees. (cold) We told the kind young lady that brought our food we hadn't received our appetizers but no longer wanted them.  A few minutes after we received our entrees our server showed up with the appetizers.   We sent them back. The likelihood of us returning is slim to none however, I gave this review two stars for one reason alone and that would be the assistant manager Doreen.  She tried to make everything as right as possible.  She took over for our server and was extremely attentive. She did an amazing job when put in a situation with unhappy customers.",

Our server seemed rushed and three of our 5 orders were wrong - my son ordered grilled cheese and carrots and received mac and cheese and oranges, I ordered no pink and my burger was pink, our appetizer was wrong also.  We had to ask for the fun, coloring menus for both kids (even though we requested kids menus for them). They brought my toddler's drink in a regular class and not a child's cup. The manager did manage to get all of us the right orders (except my burger as I didn't want to wait for an additional burger).  The kids meals were brought with the appetizers rather than with our meals. The fries were simply thrown on the plate with no presentation and were slightly under cooked. Needless to say, we'll find another Red Robin in our area to go back to next time.  The manager at this one wasn't very apologetic and it wasn't busy in the least.",

First off our waitress was too busy so another waitress came over to get us started.  She was actually pretty good.  Unfortunately our real waitress came back.    As for the food I remember not only the seasoning on the table but also on the fries.  Mine came plain which is sad to me.  I hope that isn't the new way to do things.  Lastly I got the capricie sandwich and I'm pretty sure my tomatoes were not soaked in balsamic, they were plain and ordinary ones.  Would have asked my waitress but she was otherwise occupied.",

    "text": "Went out for a nice family lunch this fine Friday afternoon. Thought red robin would be a great choice as opposed to Chevy's, hostess greeted us just fine got us our table in a timely manner. However the server we were given, seemed as if he was under pressure, in a rush, and rude. Asked us what we'd like to drink so we got our water and coke. Never received a refill after that, When I asked said, \"I'll bring it right over!\" Never came and asked again and never got it. Got my order wrong, never came by for refills, was rude to neighboring tables and could clearly see the look on their faces. Asked for a basket of fries and get them shoved in my face before I could even finish my sentence. And they were clearly from the table behind us that didn't want theirs with salt on it. Watched as the bus boy cleared a table and wipe with a dry rag. Cleaning our table as we usually do before we leave a restaurant, and dropped a cup of ranch on the floor. Asked another server for a rag or napkins, given 2 napkins to clean it up I asked the hostess for a rag because all I did was smear it, she said I'll bring you one, never did. As I saw our server to get the check he was bringing drinks to the table behind us, left a trail of water spilling out of the glass and 3 other employees walked right over it over a 5 minute period. I got the check left the money our server immediately grabbed it walked away and then said thanks for coming in. On the way out alerted the hostess that she never got the rag, then she said , \"oh I'll get right on that \" Didn't get a thank you or have a nice day. All in all poor service, can't get a simple order right and no one has any concern for safety. Safe to say won't be returning to this location any time soon",

I will say the food was pretty good, hence the one star, but we did rush to eat and regrettably had no dessert because we just wanted to leave; it was that unpleasant, and we honestly took it very personal. this was my VERY FIRST review, and I never do this, but the service there to me was that unpleasant to break that chain!",

When we finally received our drinks my husband's glass had what looked like a mixture of some syrupy stuff mixed with lipstick. When we finally got our waitresses attention she did take it and we couldn't figure out why it took her so long to come back. When she finally did, she advised that she had brought back the same glass and that she had rubbed the rim with soda water because the dishware didn't work very welll. :/ (disturbing)  we then ordered appetizers which took so long we forgot we had even ordered them. The burger was ordered medium but was so red it looked almost raw... I have to tell you that we go to the location in Henderson all the time and we have always had excellent service. That was not the case here today. I will say that in my opinion. It wasn't the poor lost soul that that served us that was at fault but lack of training and weak management that is to blame. Obviously I do not recommend this location to anyone.",

Our waitress had an attitude whenever we got her attention, as if we were a major bother to her. Not that we were able to get her attention often, as she was nowhere to be seen for most of our visit.  When our food was served, we had to ask for silverware. We had to ask for water refills and be patient about getting them. It took ages to get anyone's attention to ask for more of the bottomless fries, and it took about 20 minutes after asking for them to bring us a measly amount. We would've like to have had more, but decided against asking as we didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for them. At least the food we *did* get was good.  The new little ordering tablets they have on the tables would be awesome if they were there to supplement the service (as I imagine they're intended to do), but it appears some of the staff view them as a replacement for face-to-face service.  We come here for the food. We don't expect to be waited on hand and foot. But when the server has such an attitude and scarcely appears after being seated, it doesn't make us keen on coming back anytime soon.",

It took probably 10 minutes to get a seat, which was pretty good considering how busy it was. When we got our table, there was no silverware or napkins, and my daughter's kids menu was written in Spanish. It took 15 minutes before a waiter even acknowledged our existence! The food came pretty quick, and it was decent. I ordered a refill, and it didn't come until after we were done and paid, so I had to send it back! When I asked for more ranch, they said they were \"out of ranch\" and \"were MAKING more\" and when we asked for more fries, we had to wait for those for a considerable amount of time (very stupid considering it's a restaurant that thrives on burgers and fries, and probably should always have fresh batches ready.

Although it comes with the fries, this is the first time in about 10 visits (always in the bar area) that was done. The sauce is delicious, be sure to ask for it, if they forget to bring it.  He's to be complimented on his positive attitude, and I hope he's there next time I visit. Update: I mistakenly initially checked 1 star, it should have been 5!",

The waitress was terrible, we had to ask anther waiter for utensils after our meal arrived. We ordered our food before 2 other tables and got our food last. The food came out incorrectly. We asked for a manager and when she arrived she did not tell us she was a manager she asked if we wanted refills on our waters. So disappointed in Red Robin.",

The server was decent and we noticed that three tables in 5 minutes were getting something comped from their bill. We weren't sure if this was the server or the restaurant but we should have paid more attention. My chicken sandwich was average, but not worth the 10.00 and my boyfriend was the least satisfied. He asked for the bottomless root beer float but instead of rootbeer he'd like coke. The server brought the rootbeer float AND a glass of coke, even after explaining, again what he wanted, no fix. Then his burger came out and he took two bites and wanted to leave. Thank god we can pay by card at our seat or we would have waited ten minutes to flag someone down. Next time I know to save the 40.00 and go elsewhere.  Oh and he asked for fresh jalapenos on his burger as that was an option and got deep fried instead. He said it was all mush and that also killed the burger.",

    "text": "Not very impressed. Took about 15 min to be seated... we were the only ones waiting and it wasn't busy at all. Once food was ordered it took about 30 min to get our food. Drinks came out quick but in two waves. The food was ok considering the egg on two Royal Robin Burgers were not cooked throughly. They also brought out the wrong fries (ordered garlic fries) and the fruit for two of the kids meal had \"to be cut\" so it did not arrive with the food (we waited 30 min for our food you would think the fruit would be the easiest thing to plate). While walking to the bathroom you can catch a glimpse of the kitchen... let me tell you... you can see an over flowing trash can, trash and food on the floor. The bathroom wasn't any better... it was dirty... trash on the floor and over flowing trash cans. You can see staff talking around the kitchen and sitting in the back booths drinking soda. Maybe they are coming off shift or taking a break? Who knows... it's about 0845 on a Thursday night... if it's just staff sitting around they can help tidy up a bit... Very disappointed. However our server was quick to fix things and the hostess was pretty nice. This isn't the first time we have been to this location and always given them the benefit of the doubt... even after getting a glass of Ice Tea with a lipstick stain on it (my husband doesn't wear lipstick)... So was it clean or did they give him someone's else's glass... not sure if we will come back to this location. Should have taken pictures.",

First time it took them over an hour to get a simple order (burger and fries).  2nd time thinking it would be different (what was I thinking??)  Same thing..  somehow the order did not even get to the cook when I arrived so yes it took over an hour to get a simple to go order.",

    "text": "Last Tuesday, we went into Red Robin to enjoy my birthday burger.  If you sign up for their rewards program you receive a free burger on the month that is your birthday.  We waited for the hostess to sit us down.  They sat the ladies in front of us in the main dining area.  We were sat in a table in the bar area.  The bartender came and took our drink and food order.  Our drinks came and we finished them and then our re fills came.  Still no food!  At this time there were no other people in the area and the ladies who were sat before us were already finished with their meal.  Our food came out about 40 minutes later.  The burgers were lukewarm and fries were cold like they were just sitting there waiting for someone to bring out.  The manager then came to check on us and ask if we needed anything.    When our check came and gave them my phone number for my birthday burger.  We were told that we could use this because of the gourmet burger we ordered. We got one free burger because it was my 10th burger.  (I come to Red Robin a lot).  I am definitely not coming back in the next couple days again to receive the birthday burger.  Bartender tried to explain the confusion, still did not make sense.  Manager came back and tried to explain again.  At that point we just wanted to pay and leave.  Clearly the bartender is banging the manager because he went in the save a couple times.  Do not come to this location for the excellent service, you will not receive it.",

The service was good with multiple servers checking on us and making sure we had everything we needed. The food did take a little longer to arrive than I expected, but they were busy. My husband really enjoyed his burger. I enjoyed that I could substitute grilled chicken in one of the burger options. Since it is a chain it's so easy to Google the menu options and quickly get calorie counts. This made is much easier to make a somewhat smart choice for lunch. The food isn't too bad, service is good, and it's an economical choice.",

Our waitress came by pretty quickly and said she would be right back.  She came back shortly and took our orders.  She was a bit slow explaining the check process with their on-table machines.  So we did end up checking out through the machine but it was out of paper so we never got our receipt.  I started with the fried pickles.  They come with a spicy sauce but the waitress asked if I wanted ranch for them.  I said yes but when they came they had the spicy sauce.  Later though she brought me ranch.  I had the Banzai burger in a lettuce wrap.  This is a tasty burger with pineapple and lots of cheese.  A bit hard to eat in the lettuce so you end up knife and forking it but its still good.  And I love their fries.  The serving of fries was a bit smaller than normal but I think they are unlimited so we could have asked for more.  Mom had the Southern Charm burger.  She had asked for no produce but still wanted the grilled onions, bacon and cheese.  Well they messed it up and brought tomato and no onions.  Mom ate it anyway and said it was okay.  So a bit a miss on a few things but overall not bad.",

I just about slipped walking there. The floor was not only greasy but dirty. Then I opened the bathroom door and those floors were even dirtier.   The food came and was mediocre. I got charged for sweet potato fries even though I had told the server I didn't want them. The waiter also forgot about giving us a refill or fries after we ordered them.  He then had the manager come to the table to correct the incorrect fries charge. Well he was totally rude and told me there was a charge for the upgraded fries.... instead of apologizing for their mistake, he made me feel like I was trying to get free fries. Ridiculous.  Never will go here again! Horrible experience",

This is unacceptable customer service on any level. The manager does not know how to manage a restaurant or any of its employees. The employees were completely oblivious that I was sitting there.. and  for that long !!! nobody came up to ask \"can I help you\"? Furthermore approximately 7to 9 employees continually passed by without making any contact with myself. I hope corporate to get wind of this and hopefully maybe you can correct this that and which I doubt! Needless to say I shall never return to this restaurant ever again! I further advise anybody visiting in the area ..go to world of beer or any place other than red Robin",

However food just wasn't as good as I thought it'd be. I ordered the smoke and pepper burger and asked for no dill pickles. When my burger came and I took a few bites I opened it up and just as I suspected I wasn't given bacon. I only didn't want the dill pickles but for some reason I wasn't given any bacon which was disappointing because that was the reason I chose this burger. The slice of lettuce looked depressing as well. I got only one thin old dead looking slice of lettuce. It was crisp or a nice green color. The fries were really good though. My son got a pizza and it could've been a lot hotter. When I got to our table and maybe 5 minutes passed and I touched a slice it was already pretty cold as if it had sat for a while so that was disappointing. Even my bf said he was disappointed in his burger. He chose onion rings instead of fries and was given like 5 onion rings. Don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",

Manager walks around (or at least attempts to) in pretty woman looking boots...Making her rounds, but mostly joking around with staff.  We wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, and wait for our food.  Booties (manager) comes over and asks how we enjoyed our dinner...We then informed her that we hadn't eaten yet.  She goes back and \"checks\". Waitress, and booties (manager) tell us separately that it will be \"one minute\", or that it's \"next up\".  Whatever that means.  Food comes, and it's decent, worth the wait I suppose.

While the staples were all still there such as the bottomless fries and strawberry lemonade, the Clucks (chicken strips) were sub par at best. Not sure if they were left under the heat lamp to long or what but they were barely warm at best. Also, being that I ordered them buffalo style, I am used to them drowning them in hot sauce but this time it looks like they barely dipped them on one side only. Lydia N's sandwich while good in theory came out soggy and with a funky tasting sauce that just didn't seem to compliment such as simple item. See her review for what she ordered.   On the plus side though, they have a new drink menu with all sorts of infusions I would never dare try or even think to mix but somehow they managed to pull them all off quite well. Plus our server was awesome which is what saved this place from the dreaded one star Yelp review.",

I wish there was a little more sauce in it and the wrap was really dry and hard.  It didn't taste fresh like it should be.   In addition I tried a Baja-Turkey sandwich Club. Please do NOT order this. It tasted horrible, the sauce that they mixed with the sandwich did not compliment the turkey club the way it should be.  I was hungry, so I kept eating it.  However, the more I ate it the more the sandwich started to taste gross and the sauce makes the bread pretty soggy.

I received a chicken sandwich with a completely soggy bun and limp lettuce. I took the sandwich apart ate the bacon out out and nothing else. My water was empty my entire meal and never got refilled. Our waitress never came to check on us while eating so there was never a chance to complain. And when coming to tell us how to pay she didn't care to acknowledge the fact my food was barley touched so I did not care to leave a tip higher than a dollar. This has now occurred on three separate occasions we have waited for around 20 mins for drinks to be taken and had terrible service through out our meal as well as very very poor quality food. I don't understand why the restaurant was upgraded in the past only to lose a lot of business and not seem to care about customer service or the quality of food any longer. Unfortunately I can't say I have the desire to return to ANY Red Robin after the multiple bad experiences I have had at this one single location.",

Decided to pop in and relax while I had a little lunch - seeing how shopping can really drain your energy as well as your wallet.  I know what you're thinking - Red Robin? There's a TON of great places to eat in Vegas - why the hell would you end up there?  Well- I was craving a great burger, and I needed one FAST.  This RR is probably just like all the other RRs you've ever walked into in your entire life.  I was seated in a small table near the window, looking into the busy Galleria mall.  After checking out the menu, I decided on a \"Keep it Simple\" plain burger.   The server apologized for the longish wait and took my order.  It took what I thought was a long time for my food to finally arrive - but I was pleased with both the quality and how large my burger was.  I wasn't in a big hurry, so the wait didn't really bother me.  If you're in the mood for a gourmet burger, check out RR in the Galleria mall.  I'd like to explore the menu and try different burgers the next time I'm there.  3 outta 5 stars from me - worth checking out if you're in the area.",

Turned the call waiter light on to get refill on water and fries. Everyone ignored the light, although staff walked by every 30 seconds or so, for 25 minutes,the the waiter can back with our bill and said ' do you want anything else?' I told him not any more and he said 'sorry bout thay' and walked away. May never go back.",

The hostess sat us a table top in the bar area, when the restaurant was not busy at all. The problem was the service in the bar area. We waited 35 minutes for our burgers to arrive at our table. They were luke warm and so were the fries, the fries were also the bottom of the bag fries, the ones you can't eat. During our 30 minute wait the waiter did not check on us after she dropped off our drinks. Everyone else in the restaurant, even people that arrived after us, had their food delivered to them.  The one in Eastern is 100 times better than this location.",

    "text": "Though it was my first time to Red Robin, overall the restaurant left me with a good impression! My friends and I came after an exam and it was close to where our school is. Also, got some shopping done since it is inside the Galleria Mall!  Right when we entered, the service was quick and our server was really nice. The waiter came around multiple times throughout checking in when we needed refills on drinks and french fries.  I had ordered the Burnin Love burger hearing from my friend that it was really good. And he was right! Though Burnin Love consist of fried jalapeno circle rings, it did not make the heat too spicy or ruin my taste buds. Rather, it gave a smokey taste in the burger. I usually can tolerate spicy really well, so that may be the reason as well. In addition, the burger is really filling! And the portion is decent!  The seasoning that is available to be placed on your fries, be sure to try it! I love the dry spice seasoning, I never thought about such an idea! It made the fries have an explosion of flavors in your mouth. In addition, our server also brought us two sauces, ranch and a mustard poppy-seed one. Mustard poppy-seed was a new sauce for me, however, it was pretty good. If you are into a sweeter sauce, that one is a definite to try!  I was very satisfied with the service and the food here. Definitely will come back again.",

That being said the customer service was horrible! This seems to be a recurring issue every time we go. The only reason we go back is because the food is decent. We only saw our server once and that was to take our orders. I ordered an appetizer and that was never brought out..when I finally did get the attention of another server to let them know we were out of ketchup and needed more they brought us back a bottle that expired in June and  was PURPLE! And when they advertise bottomless fries I expect to get bottomless fries. Not one small basket of 6 fries throughout my entire meal. I've also eaten at the red Robbins on eastern and the service there was not much better..Red Robbins needs to get some serious training on customer service asap because I'm pretty sure a 10 year old could do better!",

Bottomless Freckled Lemonade (strawberries) @ $3.99 (worth it- mmmm) and endless steak fries with signature seasoned salt (at your table). Open 7 days. Fun kitsch ambiance (like Appleby's/TGIF); casual American dining. One of three locations left in Las Vegas. All good reasons to come on down.   The best ones to try: Whiskey River BBQ Burger (my husband's favorite, so he always orders this one), Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Sandwich (my favorite), Blackened Chicken Sandwich, Fish sandwich, and Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap (I might order this one again- that's how good it was). I don't really like steak fries but theirs is very good. My husband always asks for ranch. The lemonade is really good. Both the fries and the lemonade are bottomless.  It's sad that the one at Decatur/Sahara closed- we celebrated my husband's 30th there. We go to this one now.",

    "text": "Based on my most recent visit, I am tempted to give 2 stars. But considering the past when I've had above average experiences, I will stick with 3. My main issue at this particular location, consistency! The burgers are usually on point. But let me elaborate with a few examples.  1. One day I get a ton of fries, the next visit, I get like 12 fries. Literally, it was a sad little portion. They do bottomless fries, so it's totally not a big deal, again it's about consistency.  2. Service!!! One day I am blown away by the host, to server, to the management. Most recent visit, total opposite! Our waitress went missing. I literally seen everyone but her. She didn't check up on us, by the time she did, we were ready for boxes. She forgot my side of dipping sauce, as well as my ice water. Just basic, easy, not paying attention mistakes.  3. The freckled lemonade. I know they have a recipe, no reason for it to be watered down- EVER.   I like the burgers here, which is why I return. I love the decor, the new look. The family style concept. I just want more of the good from a place that has been there so long.  The prices are decent, and the food is usually good. It's an easy, convenient, burger joint. They just need to step their game up a bit.",

    "text": "This review will focus on customer service, as we should all be familiar with the food and drinks at Red Robin. (If not, think Chili's, Applebee's, etc.) We came for late lunch/early dinner and although the patio was only half full, we were told it would be at least 15 minutes as there was only one waiter. We were fine with that, and said we would wait even longer for service if we could at least be seated at an empty table while we waited. After the hostess spent several minutes tracking down a manager for permission, we were seated outdoors, at a table that was very sticky. The waiter, a young man named John, actually immediately greeted us, but it was obvious he was swamped. He was waiting on the patio customers and the indoor bar seating area customers  - the two areas that actually had customers- by himself. I did walk through the restaurant to use the restroom and noted several employees sitting in a booth in the bar area, counting tips, with numerous dirty unbussed tables in plain sight. We also watched several employees take smoke breaks while the restaurant remained dirty, and a woman who appeared to be a manager even left for the day, with practically every table not taken care of. Poor John appeared to be the only staff actually working, and he was overwhelmed. Almost needless to say (except this is a review) we waited quite a while for drinks (my sangria looked nothing like the photo and was only half-full), and when our food arrived we realized we had no silverware or napkins, and getting refills/refreshed took much longer than it should. Eventually we were the only customers on the patio but we were surrounded by dirty tables. Whomever manages the Sunday afternoon shift must put incredibly low expectations on the staff. Thank goodness we lucked into the only conscientious server; with our experience today, it is doubtful I will return.",

He was so worried about the bartender teaching him how to make drinks that he totally ignored me and my wife after we received our order (A good 40 minutes). I usually go through a couple drinks at any meal and we only got one each. He didn't even come by after we received the food to make sure everything was ok. When he finally came to our table I told him that he ignored us completely but his reply was \"I know I wasn't very attentive but they really want me to learn how to be a bartender & that's the only time he had to learn.\" Please have a talk with him & let him know what customer service is.",

Avoid it if you have hungry kids, but since we wanted pizza it's the only option. (I know, don't expect good pizza at a burger joint!! But, kids want what they want.)   Service was okay not great, it seemed that each table on either side of ya had a different server. That m ant that our server spent a lot of time out of the section we were on.

He refilled fries in a timely manner and was very knowledgeable; why I'm giving two stars instead of one.  Today I went 50 minutes before closing and asked about the happy hour $5.99 tavern double advertised online. Was told on the phone that this location does a 24/7 happy hour with half off appetizers instead. Went in and asked about this at the bar, where I was told that they do not do a happy hour, but they do have discounts on beer. Was seated in a gross dining room with many dirty tables and asked the server, showing them the advertisement online, and was told that it should say $6.99.  Finally gave up and tried to order, at which point an employee yelled from the bar \"we're close to closing, I'm not making another shake, so don't bring that crap to me.\"  I work in a restaurant and know it's frustrating when people sit past closing, but being seated at 9:10 when you close at 10:00 should not result in awful service and employees giving you no information about the menu. Managers need to properly train their staff on both closing procedure and specials, and no one should be saying there is a happy hour when there isn't.",

    "text": "I hadn't been to a Red Robin for a while and remembered really liking it (as far as a chain burger is concerned).  When my husband asked me to meet him there for lunch after he and his daughter were done shopping, I readily agreed.    Big Mistake.  1.  Filthy.  Really disgustingly dirty.  There were plates and food on tables that was there before we got there and was still there when we left over an hour later.  Our waitress spilled some iced tea on the table and the floor next to us while she was pouring.  I'm going to guess 4 oz or so.  No big deal - it happens... But then, she didn't clean it up.  We were probably there another 20-30 min after the tea... there was still a puddle on the floor.    2.  Miserable service.  I got there last & my husband had asked the server to bring me water so it would be on the table when I got there.  That was there... but she never refilled it or asked me if I wanted anything else.  I wanted a soda - but never had the opportunity to order it.  My husband had also asked before I got there, when I sat down and again when we ordered, if we could have a basket of fries as a starter (we ordered burgers, so it was part of our food).  They didn't get there until the rest of our order got there.  I was there over 30 min before we got food - he'd been there almost 10 min before me.  40 min.  And it wasn't particularly busy.  There were a few groups at tables, but at 3pm on a Sunday - the place was over 50% empty.  We weren't checked on, even after we had issues with the food (see below).    3.  Mediocre (at best) Food.  When we finally did get food, it was mediocre at best.  My fries were ice cold.  They felt like they'd been sitting under the AC duct for a while.  I actually refused them because they were so cold.  My burger was passably warm and not particularly tasty.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't wasn't great.  I could make something better at home.  My husband's burger was even less warm than mine.  He said it was ok, but would have probably been tasty if it was warm.  His daughter had a turkey sandwich and soup.  She says hers was excellent.... so 1/3 of the party was happy.  I will not be going back to this location for any reason.",

    "text": "After several hit-and-miss visits to this Red Robin location we decided to try again with a free Tavern Double burger offer.  Our previous visit in August had been wonderful, with good food and great service, so we figured what the heck.  The visit included me, my daughter, and my wife.  My wife got the chicken and shrimp, my daughter got the poutine fries, I got the free tavern double burger, and we all got a tower of onion rings.   Our server started out pleasant enough, but after we ordered he essentially disappeared, only checking back once.  I'm not sure when Red Robin decided to stop filling the ketchup containers, but the one on our table was nearly empty, we grabbed the one on the table next to ours and it was almost empty too.  My daughter liked the poutine fries, which were hot and flavorful.  My wife didn't care for her dinner, although hot it was lacking in the flavor department.  My tavern double was also hot, but had absolutely no flavor at all.  Onion rings were perfect.   Red Robin now utilizes the Zoisk table interface for most features you would have originally used a server for, which I'm not certain is such a great thing.  Upon reviewing the bill I noticed my tavern double hadn't been taken off the bill.  I used the button to call over the server, who explained that once I entered my loyalty number the burger would be removed from the bill, and indeed it was.  Paying through the interface is hassle free, and the ability to leave comments immediately is nice, however I was asked if I'd be interested in the longer survey which would be sent to my e-mail, so far no survey has arrived.  This isn't the first time that Red Robin hasn't seemed interested in the opinion they seem to be seeking.  After my last Yelp, Red Robin Management contacted me wanting my e-mail so we could correspond, but once I sent my e-mail I received no further response.  Longer story short, we went back the very next night, due to a friend having a free birthday burger.  Food quality and service were no better - and again I left a long response via the Zoisk interface and also agreed to a longer survey by e-mail and still haven't received any response by management.  For example, waited at least 10 minutes to have our drink orders taken, being asked if we would like some fries while we wait - 20 minutes later, food comes, and we're still waiting for the fries...the table next to us had been their before we came and we got our food first and this was after almost a 45 minute wait!  I can't see spending good money on mediocre food and service when there are so many better places to spend it.",

Not to mention I told the hostess Mallory that it was my birthday and mentioned it to the server. No birthday song and all of that stuff. I spoke with management and they said \" you got your food right?\" No care at all. Just steer clear and spend your money at McDonald's or in and out!",

This time was no exception (other than a small snafu with the service).  They have a new addition to their menu, where they are offering small plates at different price points.  We decided to share the wedge salad for $3.  It was small, but since we were ordering meals, it was perfect to share and really good!  I also received a beer, which I never received (more on that later).  My Mom had the seafood platter, which was surprisingly REALLY good.  The clams were perfect, as were the shrimp and cod.  We would definitely order this again, and it was reasonably priced at $13.99 (a lot of food).  I had the patty melt.  It was good - nothing too exciting, but it's hard to really screw up a patty melt.  I love that they serve thousand island dressing on the side - more places should do so.    When our food was delivered, our server also brought a 3rd entree, which we didn't order.  When we told him this, he said that I ordered the \"Oktoberfest,\" to which I explained that I ordered the BEER, not another burger.  What kind of fat asses does he think we are?! Haha...anyhow, he took the extra burger away, removed the charge from our bill and brough my beer, so all was well.  Prices are decent, and I like that you get bottomless fries.  Also, the freckled (strawberry) lemonade is refreshing and good.  This isn't someplace to go out of your way for, but if you are hungry and in the mall, it's worth a stop!",

I noticed really bad greasy finger prints all over the glass divider where I was sitting. It was disgusting and I'm a guy. You need to look through this glass to see outside. I mentioned this to the waitress but received no real response. I later emailed corporate with my complaint with the location. I received a response a few days later saying that they have notified the manager of the location. Problem was they had the wrong location listed, not even the right city. If you can't respond correctly don't respond at all. Obviously they don't much care. This was bad enough that it somewhat ruined my lunch because I couldn't help but think about what else was not cleaned.",

She left, we pressed a button for service since no one came by. It timed out twice so I asked the hostess to send someone over. The manager came by, got us more fries and drinks, but no new server. We left when our drinks ran out and we couldn't find a server for dessert.  Makes me sad because the food was good. I'll never know if the dessert was as well.",

    "text": "Lots of gourmet places here in Vegas. Since I live in Henderson, the closest will probably be the one at the M casino ( some gourmet burger and brews place ) anyhow, there are also a few places around town claiming their burgers are gourmet and some knock out fries ( will not mention that place ) come to find out when I get there that most of these places are just another Restaurant Depot ( good place to shop for business ) material product that are pretty much very pre made added with some seasoning. but I have to admit that Red Robin gourmet Burgers are pretty dang good with the bottomless garlic fries and ranch ........ Yum. Just writing this review makes me wanna go back there tomorrow and get down on some crazy Banzai Burgers with garlic fries, unfortunately I can't be pounding on burgers because I can't afford to get any bigger than I am already. But I shall be back. And soon.... When I have a cheat day which is almost everyday. I am so down to pound down that burger. The price of these burgers are almost as much if you go to fat burger or Carl's Jr. It's crazy.... So red robin for me is the way to go. I am not too crazy about burgers but when I am craving for it..... Yes let's go. Plus this location is so perfect ( galleria mall ) eat ( red R ...shop .... dessert ( Cinnabon).  My experience with service in this location has always bee gnarly.... So I dunno what to say about the other reviews , maybe I just kept getting lucky",

I'd order more fries but they would just take another 15 minutes. Waiters insist on you ordering and paying from the tablet on the table.   Did this place change managers or something because there has been a big dip in quality recently.",

This location is located inside the Galleria Mall and it is surprisingly spacious inside.   I went with the Guacamole Burger on a jalapeno kaiser roll. You also get bottomless fries but honestly, what they serve is plenty!  The burger was ok and for the price I expected a bit more.   I'd definitely go back and glad I popped my Red Robin cherry!",

Honestly this is what I have come to expect from Red Robin so it's not the end of the world.  I did try one or the new Nashville burgers which was pretty good and has a decent kick to it. It's a bit excessive with bacon, fried egg, onion straws, cheese and 2 types of sauce. That being said it wasn't totally overwhelming.  Kids got kids meals, wife got a guacamole bacon burger. Food was as expected and isn't usually disappointing and their is the advantage of all you can eat sides (fries).   I will continue to make the yearly pilgrimage to get the free birthday burgers. You should too as long as you go in with lowered expectations. If you are expecting perfection, stay clear of fast casual, family style restaurants.",

My family and I got sat within 5 mins. great start because it wasn't busy which is also another reason we decided to give it a try again.  Well a few minutes in and we were completely ready to order everything. It has now been at least 20 mins and I am getting so annoyed well now at least 30 mins and someone finally a server came over and said \"hey I am helping your server out because he is a little busy, let me at least get your drink order\" well guess what it took another 10 to just get those well now we are waiting forever for said server to come over and get our food order (keep in mind 2 four tops sat down 1 two top and 1 6 top came in after us and had already gotten there drinks and food at the table before we even got our order in) finally I stop someone who appears to be a manager and ask if he can take our order which he does. We get our food cool but guess what the manager said he would also bring my 7yr old some frys and never did. well my daughter and I both got salads as our side and no one brought us utensils I took a few bites of my burger and ended up having to tend to my 3 month old so I let my husband eat first so he could take her then I could eat. So he finishes and takes the baby for a stroll mean time my oldest and I still have no utensils cause no one has come over to even ask us if everything is okay. So I had to get up and walk over to a server and ask for forks. We finish our food and I'm so pissed off that my dinner experience was more than 2 hrs and we still didn't even meet our server whoever it was.   By the way I am in the restaurant industry and I have never experienced such horrible service this restaurant needs better guest satisfaction",

I'll keep you updated as this train wreck unfolds.  Edit: We just left and I must say I feel like crap. The burgers we had tasted like piles of mush. Our server didn't check on us once after we got our food. Table was full of trash from the steak fries we got bombarded with before we even got our food. Our server seemed to  only speak in 2 word sentences yelling across the bar sometimes. Need something? More fries? Doin good?   Overall experience wasn't as I hoped. The restaurant was overall dirty and other servers/bussers kept walking by our table not even acknowledging the trash on other tables that weren't even cleared when we were first sat. Not coming back anytime soon.",

Thank you to Eric, the bartender- who was also our server on the patio area! Eric was super patient with all my friends' demands, in a good way! LOL.  Today was the perfect day to sit on the patio, before it got gray out. The patio was not originally open, but Eric was kind enough to let our group of six sit on the patio. If you never been to Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, they offer more than just burgers. They also serve items like, salad, soup, nachos, fries and more! They offer a large menu.   What I really wanted to eat was a big fat juicy burger, but because i'm on low carb at the moment, I opted to try the Wedge Salad, a few of their unlimited steak fries and a bite of my friend's burger. The bun was interesting, it wasn't warm and it was slightly stale. The actual patty was juicy with cheese melting all over. The burger came with lettuce, tomato, mayo and a jalapeno. The steak fries were hearty, crispy and thick- i enjoyed dipping these into the chipotle sauce! All in all, good stuff.  Thanks again to Eric who provided us great customer service!",

Well after shopping we were getting hungry so we decided on eating at Red Robin, we were standing at the front counter as employees walked by us and didn't say a word, not hello or we will be right with you, nothing after standing there for about 5 minutes we sat ourselves,then as we were sitting waiting for a response from someone, at that time I really wasn't sure who was working our table so we took the time to figure out what we wanted to order, finally a waiter named Joe came over and welcomed us and took our drink order and food order, about 10 minutes another person with out a name tag brought our food, I looked around and did not see any dirty tables and the place was pretty clean ( the place being dirty was in majority of reviews) I didn't see anything dirty, so I figured I would look at the restrooms, not dirty in there either, well getting back to the food, my blue ribbon burger was great cooked the way I ordered and my wife's burger was great too, fries were warm and Joe kept our table clean and drinks filled, I wish I could have given 5 stars but I couldn't do to the fact that no one would welcome us or seat us when we came in, and we seated ourselves when the restaurant had only 8 customers at the most, so the staff were not too busy to give a simple hello, burgers were good so I will be back to see if anything changes,",

    "text": "My husband, my daughter and I stopped in for dinner on a busy Friday. We were greeted by a friendly host who took our name for the wait list. We sat on comfortable chairs and waited for about 15 minutes. Once called we were led to a table by the mall entry which made for good people watching. Our waitress was beautiful and energetic. She had colorful hair. She was fast, efficient and friendly. My husband and I ordered the fish meals. I ordered fish and chips. He ordered fish and shrimp with coleslaw and fries. My daughter ordered a gluten free burger on a gluten free bun. The fries are cooked in a separate fryer so cross contamination doesn't happen. For our beverage selection my daughter ordered lemonade; I chose ice tea and my husband had water. Everything was fresh, hot and delicious. I like their tartar sauce. It isn't overwhelming-it's mild with a good flavor. The cod was cooked to perfection--crispy. My husband's shrimp and cod was crispy and hot. My daughter's cheeseburger was cooked medium for her. She enjoyed it as well.  It was an enjoyable dinner. We will be back.",

When we arrived, they were not so busy but as we were being served our food, the patrons started to arrive and the quantity of the people were a bit much for their staff.  The bottomless drinks, side salad and fries were amazing.  Although we waited long for one refill of our drinks and fries, we were happy just to be able to enjoy more of the fries and drinks.  John gave us an extra side salad to compensate the long wait for the refills, we thought that was very thoughtful of him. Red Robin serves good food with amazing flavors and we will for sure come back.  Happy New Year to all of you at Red Robin.",

Last visit waitress didn't put our order into the system for nearly 20 minutes after taking it. Over an hour later it comes out and is completely wrong.

For our burgers we chose the jump start double 3/5, the reds tavern double 4/5, always a good choice when you get it ghost pepper style, and the smoke and pepper burger, one of their new items 4/5. all around a good lunch and nicely located at Galleria mall so you can get your shop on after a nice bite for lunch.

I ordered the el Dorado burger with voodoo fries. I got my wife the cheeseburger and tried the fried pickles too. I don't feel that they care about there product anymore. They just try to be gimmicky now and not really put out a good product. Burger was overpriced and just whatever. No excitement to it. Flavors were blah. It looks like the fries were an after thought. They just took there steak fries and plopped a bit of stuff on it. Fried pickles seemed old or frozen. They were a waste of 5$. I am so disappointed. Use to be such a good chain. COME ON RED ROBIN!! BRING THE YUMMMMMM BACK!!!!",

    "text": "I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS LOCATION ZERO STARS!! I called to order some food for take out and had to repeat the order over and over for 15mins dude to the employee not being able to speak clearly or pay enough attention to listen. I've always enjoyed their food in the past and was looking forward to showing my family visiting from out of town how good it was. I went in to the restaurant 23 mins after my order as instructed and then had to wait almost another 30mins for it to be ready. Seems like this situation isn't the exception but the rule as other people who were irritated and had been waiting for their food long before us got it almost the same as time we got ours. I get home and open the bags to find our food ice cold as if it was taken from other orders already sitting out and forgotten, barley any fries inside the containers (endless fries....? Yeah right!) and each of the burgers looking like they were prepared incorrectly seeing as each had pieces and residue of condiments we specifically asked not to have put on while ones we did ask for were nowhere to found. I called to speak to the manager so I could let them know what garbage was being sent out as the to go orders, and let her know of my dissatisfaction. I told her I'd be leaving this review and she should make sure others don't get the same kind poor excuse for food once they get home. Although they did offer to remake food I didn't feel like taking the chance of the same thing happening again. She asked for my email which I gave and then promised she'd be sending me out an email to \"have our next meal on us\" coupon and yet to my surprise I haven't received anything in my email. If you feel the overwhelming urge to get take out I highly recommend checking each and every part of your order seeing as this specific Red Robin can't seem to correctly prepare food. I wish I would have gone against my gut and drove to any one of the lower quality fast food places instead, at least they get it right and I don't spent 50$ for ice cold , incorrectly prepared, garbage food. If I had known this would be the quality I food I'd be getting I would have gone to McDonald's instead.....",

We visited last night (for the last time) and were seated quickly although it was busy.  Waited quite a while before our drink order was taken and waited even longer to receive the drinks and place our order.  My order was wrong and my salad arrived with no dressing.  Couldn't find a server to flag down to correct the order and then waited long enough for my husband to finish his meal before my correct order arrived.  No apologies from the server.  I noticed the guests dining behind us were also experiencing similar issues, and so I'm guessing our server was having an off-night.  But this is the second visit we've had (different servers) with the same complaints.  There definitely needed to be some retaining with that remodel!",

    "text": "I have been a fan of Red Robin since the beginning. I generally love the fries and the Royal Red Robin burger. I recently moved to the Las Vegas area so I was used to quality service and food in my old Escondido, CA location. However, I tried eating at the Galleria location for the first time back in October and the service was slow and the fries were cold. I thought it was a fluke, but I went again with the same result, slow service and cold fries. After the 4th visit with the same results, I've concluded that this place has a problem. Then I went to another Red Robin on Eastern and had the same problems. Is it truly impossible to receive hot fries without complaining about it? Maybe these Red Robins in Henderson should reach out to the Escondido location and emulate their practices, because these two have been disappointing.   Also, the Galleria spot has a section that I always seem to be seated at that sits flush up against the mall entrance, so you essentially become a spectacle for about 1000 people as they walk into and out of the mall. It makes it feel like I'm eating at a hotdog on a stick in the food court, when all I wanted was a nice atmosphere to eat in. I don't want an audience to stare at me while I stuff my face with a Royal.  The extra star I give them is for being on point with the burgers, those did not disappoint.  Update: Since writing this I have been notified by their corporate office that these locations will be reviewed and might be remedied. I will be heading back to the Galleria location and I'll update my review with whether or not they are still dishing out cold French fries or not. Hopefully they will put up a wall in that section in front of the entrance.",

The only reason why I came here for lunch was due to the fact that I work in Henderson along with me and my friend getting some shopping done at Galleria Mall. Otherwise, if that weren't the case I would not have opted for lunch here.  The burger selection is alright at best. I guess I can say I'm only a fan of theirs due to their bottom-less basket of fries with additional Red Robin seasoning - YUM! Their shakes are pretty deliciously as well, but this is a burger joint. You don't go to a steak house for their mashed potatoes, right? Same thing here: you don't go to a burger joint for their fries and shakes.  I can say that my waitress was a doll and was constantly checking up on us. I'm a big fan on excellent customer service, which is probably why she got a decent tip from both of us.  To sum it up, if I'm in the mood for some delicious fries and a good shake then I'll come here. If I'm in the mood for a good burger, I'll head elsewhere.",

The location was very busy (around 8:30 PM on a Saturday night) but we were seated within 5-10 minutes.  Our server was friendly and helpful, and we were able to watch several football games on different TVs while we waited for our food. The only reason this review gets four stars instead of five is because we waited a pretty long time. When the food came out, I realized I had ordered the wrong burger entirely (my mistake!) and they immediately offered it to replace it for me for free. Thank you Red Robin!  Another thing I liked about this location is the little iPads at every table. You can either pay $1.99 to play trivia games throughout your meal (no thanks!) or pay right at the iPad by credit or debit card instead of waiting for your bill (yes please!).   I'll visit again.",

They weren't expecting it, and as you can imagine, it was a lot for anyone to handle, especially right at open.  We all had separate bills, too.  Any server's nightmare!  But the staff did such a great job, got all the food orders right and everything was perfect - especially the BLOODY MARY'S!!!!  (shhhhh ;)  Great job RR!",

The place was a complete mess and dirty. It wasnt even full, they couldnt sit people due to poor service and dirtiness. There was more dirty tables than people dining. Horrible and nasty. My appetizer and side fries came out 10 min after my main meal. They completely messed up my order and when i ordered extra bottomless fries took them 30 min to come out. They never refilled our drinks and the food was horrible and burger was burnt. Fries were dry and hard and burnt. They sat us outside and forgot about us. I had to call them 5 different times. Plus we were sat oiutside in the entrance of the mall with nothing but nasty dirty tables and food all over the floor were everyone can see. When i mentioned something they were just plain rud. Never go to the galleria mall red robin. Horrible hated my dinning. Will never go again. Im an executive sous chef and ive never been treated like this anywhere and have had poor service such as this. If i can give it 0 stars i would. Never would have expected this from a red robin.",

We were famished when we arrived we were sat at a table in a timely fashion and we had a waitress take our order within the first 10 minutes. After waiting 30 minutes the waitress came back apologize for the slowness of the food, filled up our drinks and told us that it wouldn't be much longer for our burgers. Despite this we waited almost another 25 minutes before our burgers came out and we could finally start eating. My burger was not very hot when it arrives and the fries were soggy. My friend's burger was dry and the meat was over cooked. She told the waitress this when she came back to check on the us and the only compensation she would offer is to make her  another burger. This was after we had waited over an hour for our food and were so hungry by the time the food finally arrived. Quite disappointed with the service and the quality of food this time for the prices we paid. I am not sure would dine there again.   Dined here again on May 8th Sunday 2016 Great lunch today much improved food from the last time around. The waitress was great and very friendly. I will be updating my review from the last visit to a great dining experience !! Thank you for asking us to try Red Robin again...much better experience !!",

After asking for the refill two employees explained that they don't have bottomless milkshakes. We didn't ask for a bottomless (unlimited refills) milkshake, we asked for the refill as advertised in the menu. One of the employees then explained the small extra portion in the metal mixing cup served with the glass was supposed to be the refill. Would that have refilled the glass cup? No way!  Milkshake tradition dictates that the milkshake be served with the leftovers in the mixing cup. This has NEVER been considered a refill. Especially because it couldn't possibly refill the glass. Bottom line is that we loved the staff but I HATE BEING LIED TO!!! Dear Red Robin Marketing Department, go back to the second grade for a refresher!",

Didn't feel special at all and often had to wait 15 minutes just to be checked on. I had to ask for napkins and silverware. The floors were greasy and needed to be swept. There was 3 unclean tables that weren't clean the whole time I dined in. They had enough staff but most likely not trained well which is why this location will suffer. The burgers were up to the standards of a Burger King or Wendy's (which I would of rather had) very dry bun, not hot, no flavor and overall a huge disappointment. Manager was a duty too he had a blue shirt and goatee. I wouldn't know his name because he showed zero effort to connect with guest. Seems like the staff just runs around looking busy but really they have no idea what they at doing.",

I went to the restaurant on a week night, so it was not really busy...when I walked in, the hostess was busy talking to another employee and did not acknowledge me, so I went to the bar area instead. It took a little while for the bartender to see that I was there and get me a menu, but that was fine. After giving me the menu it was like he forgot about me.

We both work around the UNLV area so usually we pick somewhere around there, but one Friday found us both at home and so we headed to the mall (yeauck!) and plopped ourselves down at Red Robin to eat in tandem what we'd both talked about in the past: the Whiskey River Chicken Burger.  Now, other places (like my esteemed Otto's) definitely do burgers better, but this chicken sandwich is absolutely dynamite.  A big, thick, juice chicken breast smothered in cheddar, bbq sauce and onion straws.  It's served with bottomless steak fries, but if you get through the sandwich you're not going to have any room.  If you're more of a burger fan, I've tried them before and they're definitely good!  Again, I've had better, but these puppies aren't anything to thumb your nose at if you're in the mood for some red meat.  May I suggest the Banzai Burger with teriyaki and grilled pineapple?    Boo, it's in a mall.  Boo, it's a chain.  But man, that's one tasty bird on bread.",

I don't know why others on here gave bad service reviews because my service was fast and the waiter was very friendly; and this was new years eve when the entire Galleria mall in Henderson was busy with shoppers.  I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger with a side of ranch dressing and found it very delicious.

We informed the manager \"Ryan\" and he just smiled with a condescending attitude. He waited for us to request an adjustment to be made instead of offering. This place obviously needs new management and a health inspection.",

    "text": "Never thought I would differentiate between Red Robins, but there really are differences! I greatly prefer the RR out near Summerlin. This location is a bit difficult to get to with all the mall construction, but if you're looking for it from the inside it's in the middle of the upper level.   LOVE the bottomless fries! Had the California Chicken sandwich, and should have paid more attention because bacon, mayo, and avocado is really overkill on the same sandwich. Ended up ditching the mayo-soaked bottom bun - we're not counting calories on vacation, but damn!  Decided to grab a couple drinks, and I wouldn't recommend the Long Island - ironically it tasted pretty much like a virgin mocktail, and had about the same effect. The Blue Moon shake is friggin' delicious, though, if you have room for some ice cream. :-)   Service was alright - I feel like this location is putting a lot of pressure on their staff to upsell drinks and desserts. Can't fault my server for that, so tone it down, management!   If I'm staying out in Henderson again, I'd return with a more selective eye. The surrounding mall/shopping is great!",

    "text": "I usually have decent meals here at Red Robin.  The location is easy to find at the Galleria Mall.   It's located right off of Sunset and you can see their restaurant sign from the parking lot.  Since it's at the mall, it's usually pretty busy from open to close but I can usually get seated fairly quickly.   They do have tables in the bar area so you don't have to wait if you don't want to.     The menu is pretty huge with so much to choose from.  They have such a great selection of different burgers!  I always order medium rare and they do a good job with getting that right.  I have a love/hate relationship with their french fries.   I love them and hate that they are unlimited!  On my last visit I tried their sweet potato fries.  They bought out a huge side of them.  Unfortunately they weren't cooked long enough and almost like I was eating raw potatoes.  Strange.   I had to ask them to cook more.  Hopefully that doesn't happen on a consistent basis.  I will note that their kitchen seems to take longer than most places to prepare your meals.  Maybe that's why I get appetizers since I'm waiting a while.    Customer service here is really hit and miss.  You can get a really upbeat waiter/waitress one day but the next they are a downer.  I do, however, realize on a regular basis the servers don't really come back to the tables as often as they should.  Drinks do go empty and I'm always looking around for them to get the check.    In my opinion there are better places for burgers with better service.  I keep holding out hope they will improve.",

I had to do some shopping at the mall, so I went in the entrance and the photos looked delicious, so in I went.  They have quite a few gourmet burger selections, and the prices were as high as I remembered from my first visit. But considering the prices of burgers, especially gourmet ones, they didn't feel outrageous as in the past.  I went with the Royal Red Robin burger, with egg and bacon. It was really very good. A milkshake for $3.99 added on, it was about $18 all in with tip.   No complaints here, service was good, and you do your check out right at the table with the electronic pad. Interesting that the auto tip starts at 20%....you can adjust if you like.   Nothing fancy, but it was a good burger so 3.5 stars overall. I would return to try other selections.",

Some new appetizers too.   Still I wasn't impressed with the new signature burger that is being marketed. Pepper & Smoke.  Smoked sea salt, smoke and pepper ketchup black pepper bacon. Ciabatta bread.   Sounds awesome!  Good combo of ingredients! Sadly execution wise the handmade Angus Beef burger was a fail here.  I didn't taste a hint of pepper or smoky flavor at all.  Now that I think back on it could be they gave me the wrong order since it resembled more like a bbq burger with fried onions and bbq sauce.  Either way though, the patty was dry and no flavor.    I really liked the service though this time around.  The side of  Yukon potato chips and onion dip is pretty good and I like the price points for the sides 3,5 and 7 dollars.  So maybe I'll just keep this place in mind for happy hour.",

Now, the potions are smaller, the drink glasses are filled to the top with ice so if you need a refill, you have to get the attention of a waiter IF you can find one and the waiters which are no where to be found. Speaking of the drinks, they are charging you a few dollars for a fountain drink that literally costs them just cents, so why fill the glass with ice? Poor business practice. Also, you use to get plates full of food and now you get small plastic bowl or container, I'm not sure what it's called. Oh I know, it's called garbage. This place has become garbage.

It was busy, and we had Renee as our waitfrss and she couldn't have been any better to us. We got the tower of onion rings as our app. Which was delicious! We all got tavern doubles and they were yummy. Service was good but food took a long time",

    "text": "Wow. I can't believe people eat this stuff on the regular.   This was my first time ever at a Red Robin and it was pretty much what I thought it would be... cookie cutter food, mundane vibe, and terrible service. Normally, I save the bad reviews for my second visit, purely to be fair. I mean everyone has a bad day, but I don't ever foresee myself coming back here.  When you're with the parents, sometimes you're just too hung-over to fight for a better place to eat, hello Red Robin. After waiting fifteen minutes for a table into a partly filled dining room, we were escorted to our seats. As we walked past the miles of screaming kids and sad looking overwhelmed parents. I noticed that not only was the place was relatively empty, but the empty tables were covered in dirty plates and old food scraps. Yummy.   We sat down and were literally passed by three different servers for about ten minutes until finally a served stopped before walking by us and asked if we had been helped, \"No, not yet\", \"oh man, well you're not even my table, so I'll be right back\", wow. He did come back to take our order, but you have to realize at this point we have been in this place for almost twenty five minutes and haven't even received a glass of water.   The food was a strong meh. I ordered the Ensenada Chicken Platter, with a side salad, pre-seasoned bagged frozen food, limp salad, and tons of dressing, because what do you do to mask bad food? Drown it in sauces and salt-based spices. I know this pace is known for it's burgers, but I wasn't feeling it, sorry Red Robin.   The beer menu also confused me. They have the Stone and I believe Lagunitas logos on their beer menu, but when I asked, what kind of Stone they had on tap, the server said they didn't have any, wait what? It was all Sam Adams and Miller brands, so I ordered Iced Tea. Why add this logo to permanent, laminated alcohol menu and not even have it in stock?   Beyond the bad service, lack of good beer, and questionable food. Our bill was still pretty pricey, over sixty dollars for three people at chain restaurant? Note-to-self, don't let anyone else choose the lunch spots from now on.   RED ROBIN... No, Not Yum.",

Went right in and sat at the bar and ordered lunch. Within fifteen minutes had the Royal Red Robin. Cooked to order and the taste was as expected. The waitress/bartender was attentive. The Lady who brought my Burger came back a couple times to see if there were any issues, which was a nice touch. Bonus points for stopping by when my mouth want full.  Next time an in Vegas will come back to this one, and will go to one in another place when come across a Red Robin.",

Fried on other plate hot.  Ordered some onion rings that never arrive.  When server was asked she said she forgot to put the order in.  Never even an offer to refill drink glasses.  Food was no more than average.  Not was we've experienced at other Red Robin's.  Will likely pass on these guys in the future.",

We thought our waiter would be cool and attentive, sadly we were mistaken...we ordered two of the 6.99 burgers and BOTTOMLESS fries as well as a rasberry cream soda. The wait for the food was a little long but hey it was actually worth the wait, the burgers and a small handful of fries were delicious; as to why I gave this two stars but our waiter I would give 1 or just none. He was more attentive towards other customers then us never asked if we wanted more fries, forgot our soda like twice. Not to mention that we asked for napkins and got it 15 minutes later... They just seemed like they were short staff or I don't know, come for great food but expect BAD costumer service and waiting forever for a table.",

    "text": "The last time been to Red Robin was back when lived in Colorado. Talking over twenty years ago. It was ok. Just another mass marketed chain burger restaurant. I came for lunch with visitors from the 808. This location its inside the Galleria Mall. It actually decent size for shopping mall location.   I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger. It really comes down BBQ burger with fried onion rings and the basic works inside. I had no idea you could order half size or smaller size they call it. I ordered the regular size. My friend she ordered small size even then felt like that decent size. It came with your choice of sides stuck with tradition steak cut fries. The fries was not very good, under seasoned, not very hot and crispy out of the fryer. The burger thought was good. I definitely had better the same concept at other burger joints around town. We all shared the stack of onion rings. Again just ok. The presentation was kind of cool but once grabbed one nothing special about them. If anything tasted like frozen pre battered onion rings then fresh ones. Overall would say not the worst place in the world could go for burger but probably be my last last choice.  The service was ok. I thought was odd that the server was passing us the bill from behind our booth in service station. Rather then coming up to the table more professional. Never rude just felt like he not engaged and came to drinks not on top of keeping full glass.",

It took 40 minutes to get our meals and then the burger might as well have been hockey puck between 2 buns, because it was black and rock hard. If you're going to assume how someone likes their burger cooked... I wouldn't guess \"charred\" would be the correct answer.   Then we sat with food on our table for another 10 minutes with no one coming by to check on us and no silverware. By the time they finally came over I decided I didn't even want the burger remade because my infant was getting fussy and I didn't want to wait any longer.   They took my meal off the bill but no other action was taken. You would think, at the very least, a gift card for a free burger or 20% off next time or something. I won't be back any time soon but, given the poor level of customer service, they probably don't care.",

    "text": "This particular location is inside the Galleria Mall, however there is an outside entrance if you do not desire to walk through the entire mall to get here. On this occasion, there were only two of us and upon checking in we were told there would be a 20-25 minute wait. (Lunchtime) The hostess who checked us in was polite enough, however the second hostess , Champagne or Charmagne was openly annoyed and I witness her impatient eye rolls and attitude towards other guests. There were several empty, yet dirty tables that had not been attended to , for which I assumed contributed to the longer wait time. I did notice that the hostess were both doing their part in helping with the cleaning of said tables, however leaving people confused as to where they were and where they were to check in at. Once they called our name, we were led to the back of the restaurant near the cooking area. Right away, I was completely annoyed. As I looked around he area, all I noticed were large parties. (6, 9, 8, etc) One particular party was a group of 20, which were over the top loud and being openly obnoxious. As our waiter approached I started looking around at possible other seating options, however empty tables in view were still dirty. I paused a moment before accepting that we may just have to make the best of it. Our waiter, Mackenzie, was great and did his best to make be as attentive as possible. Waiting for our food, however, the noise level became too much and my annoyance took over. Why should a party of 2 have to be subjected to such a ridiculous scene. The hostess should ask a smaller party if they want to be seated in an area that they typically seat larger parties, I couldn't even have a conversation if I want to someone sitting across the table from me! If I would have been given a choice, I most definitely would have waited for a different table! Once the food came, I had all but lost my appetite and picked at my Caesar wrap, which was bland and unspectacular. At this point, I just wanted to get the hell out of here! As we waited for the check, wouldn't you know, some of the party of 20 started to trickle out, choosing to stand by our table to finish conversations and laugh...hitting our chairs and table numerous times. I'm disappointed at the waiters and the manager for not asking these guests to keep their banter and obnoxious laughs to a reasonable degree as well, every guest deserves to have an enjoyable dine in meal. With the wait to be seated and the time it took to get our meal, were here close to 1:45 minutes. I will not return to this location, the organization of the establishment is not worth the headache or the wasted time. My two stars are for our poor waiter, he did a great job in what was I'm sure a stressful situation for him as well!",

It took 10 min for the server to order drinks. 25 min for an appetizer and 40 minutes to get to the main entree. We didn't bother with desert.   Food was so disappointing. Sorry I didn't take photos of the food. I had the BLTA turkey croissant sandwich. Bread was dry, 1 thin piece of turkey and the texture of the bacon seemed like it was microwaved. Did I forget to mention the amount of mayonnaise that was put on both sides of the bread?! No exaggeration, about a 1/4 cup!  I had a side of broccoli that was flimsy  over-cooked and slightly browned. I had a side of fruit that was browned and dry.  Seemed like my food came from a run down gas station deli.  My refill glass of strawberry lemonade had previously dried strawberry seeds on the rim!  The manager was called over. We explained our experience. He came to our table dragging his feet. He didn't care to hear a word and was quick to say we will deduct the meals and sides from the bill. By the way, the manager admitted to the broccoli being microwaved.  I'm not going to mention the disaster of the other entrees.   Just terrible. I will not recommend or dine at this Red Robin again.",

    "text": "Today, a good friend and I came to Red Robin for a light meal.  I've always loved their burgers but today we were looking for a salad.  The place was busy! Good thing there was ample space, we got seated right away.  I enjoy the open concept that this place offers.  There's pictures everywhere and the wooden panels show character.  The server on the other hand, was really not impressionable at all.  I even forgot his name and I literally left about 20 minutes ago!  Today I got the Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad for $10.19.  As said on their menu, this dish includes ancho-grilled chicken breast, avocado slices and fresh-fried jalapeno chips on top of crisp greens.  I added the salsa-ranch dressing on the side. This salad is finished with diced red and green bell peppers and onions, black beans, roasted corn, cheddar cheese and crunchy tortilla strips.  This salad was good!  The chicken was flavorful and juicy.  I greens and tortilla strips really offered some great texture.  I also enjoyed the fried jalapeno chips.  It was the right kind of bad that I needed LOL.  Everything together really made the dish a southwestern masterpiece!  I will definitely be back for more!",

    "text": "So, I should preface this with sharing the fact that I used to work at Red Robin (for 5 years) and I was a trainer (both in store and on a regional level).  It's been awhile since I've gone to a Red Robin, so either the company model has fallen to the wayside, or my experience today was a fluke.  Either way it was unacceptable.    My friend and I went, and upon walking in there were 2 employees talking at the host stand..when the Hospo (host) finally acknowledged us, it wasn't with a warm greeting, it was mere eye contact, and dull at that.  Sensing a disconnect, I piped up with \"There's 2 of us Please.\"  He took us to our seats, sat us and told us in a monotone voice that \"your waitress would be right with you.\"  I know it's not a big deal..but at Red Robin, branding is everything..and the wait staff is referred to as \"Servers\".  But whatever.     Expected the 30 second greet, I was disappointed,  but I remembered what it was like for me sometimes, so I shrugged that off.  Though we did sit there for a good 5 minutes.  Long enough to go back and forth on which burger to order and what to have as a side, etc.    The server finally got over to us (I kick myself for not remembering her name..I think it was Mitzy or something uncommon.  She was on the older side, Caucasian, brownish hair.)  She was pleasant enough at first.  So we ordered our drinks and placed our food order.  Since it was my friends birthday, she informed the server that she had a credit for a free birthday burger in case it mattered either way.  The server didn't offer any birthday wishes, but instead seemed kind of blah about having us at her table with that new information.  Having been a server for this company that (used to) basically bend over backwards for the guest, I was surprised, but again, whatever.  It's important (and only fair) that I mention that she was never outright RUDE.    Our food comes, she brings us additional napkins and topped off my iced tea.  At that point I looked around at all the servers to note the collective disposition:  only 1-2 seemed happy or at least GOOD at faking a sense of happiness.  The rest seemed a range from blah to outright angst at having to be there.  The bill comes and the server leaves it without asking for the Loyalty card that had my friends free bday burger credit on it.  I get that perhaps her memory isn't incredibly sharp, so I can't hold that against her.    We put the card in with the extra payment for our drinks, etc.  She comes, takes it, and brings it back.  It's only as shes turning to walk away from the table do we hear a \"thanks\" in a monotonous tone.  The change was $2 (on a $20 bill discounted down to $7) so that's what we left.  *shrugs*  I didn't feel that she did anything to deserve more.  The final straw of this decision was that she never once said a simple \"Happy Birthday\" to my friend, even after it was mentioned in the beginning and, of course, when she ran the promotional credit for the bday burger.    Essentially she treated us like we were going to be a waste of her time/not tip well, so I had no issue helping her to fulfill her own self-made prophesy  :-)",

It's nice they have a variety of burgers to chose from, but when you bite into the burger it's not anything spectacular.

    "text": "Had lunch at this location while visiting recently. I've never been to Red Robin before  so I was really looking forward to their burgers. Took about half an hour to get seated, but it was busy and at a mall location. Our initial waiter was nice, but the wait time for the food to arrive after we ordered took an hour. In that time I watched two tables finish their meals, and two new groups get seated and finish their entire meal before our food arrived. We had drank all our water while waiting so it would have been nice if our server came by to check on us and refill our water glasses. When the food finally did come it was delivered by the manager who apologized and blamed the cooks. A waitress came by a few minutes later with the sauces for our burgers. She said she noticed them in the kitchen and assumed it was part of our order. She seemed annoyed and unfriendly, but I couldn't tell if it was because of us or something else.  The burgers and fries were decent -- not great, but not bad. We could tell that some of the burgers had been sitting a while because they weren't warm at all. The milkshakes were amazing. I was starving so I wolfed down my \"bottomless\" fries. I wanted to get more fries but our waiter had completely disappeared at this point, and I wasn't sure how long it would take to bring more out. Our waiter did show up again at the end to bring us the bill. I wasn't the one who paid the bill, but I was disappointed it wasn't discounted since we had to wait an hour for the food, that hour wait affected the quality of the food, and the service was not that great.  When I've had bad experiences at other restaurants before, our bill was discounted/comped or we were offered some food as a make-good to make up for a bad dining experience, and those times weren't as ridiculous as our visit to this Red Robin.  Verdict: if you want a warm/fresh gourmet burger next time, you'd be better off ordering a Six Dollar Burger at Carl's Jr. Or really, any other fancy burger chain.",

We waited at the host stand a good ten minutes before the customer behind us got frustrated and went to get somebody who was more busy reprimanding people than helping us get seats as she looked our way.  The woman came over and sat us at a table.  We waited another ten minutes and never got acknowledged by anyone.  We were hoping to at least place a drink order but no one ever came.    We finally decided the wait was too long since we were starving and headed to the mall food court and had the best gyros from kyklos greek cafe.  This is the second time this has happened to us at this location.  I wrote the company about our situation and have yet to hear a response. Not that I care since I wont go back there.  The burgers are great here but I dont see fit in this economy to drop $10.00 for a burger plus drink and receive bad service when IN-N-OUT is right across the parking lot!

I walked over to the bar and the bartender Amanda came over right away and took my order. The free burger didn't come with fries, but they were offered to me so I added them on. I also ordered a beer while I waited for my food.   The burger and fries came out pretty fast and was delivered with ranch as well, which is always nice to not have to ask for. Amanda checked on me shortly after it came out to see if I needed anything. While I enjoyed my meal, the manager (didn't catch his name) who was working on various things said hello several times and asked me how the food was and called me by name (apparently he had been told I was taking them up on the free burger promo). Overall I found the staff to be very pleasant and I actually felt like they were glad I participated in the promo and appreciated me coming in as opposed to being treated like a freeloader who just came in for a cheap meal.   To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the food at Red Robin, the burgers are good and the fries are okay, but I keep coming back to this location because the staff has always been consistently pleasant at this location. 5/5 for service, 4/5 for food, rounding up because I was treated right.

She is the friendliest waitress we have ever come across - really outgoing, funny and personable - she will go out of her way to make sure all of your requests are met.  After our first time having her as our waitress, we came back, sat in her section and she remembered all of our special requests from the time before! The last time we were there, we requested to sit in her section and we were informed that she was getting ready to serve a group of 24 people.  She found out that we were there and insisted that we be sat in her section and by the time we got to our table, she already had our drinks, a hot basket of fries and our special \"cold\" buzz sauce waiting for us!  Tonight, we were on the Strip and decided to go to a popular \"burger bar\" at Mandalay Bay.  We had the worst service ever, the bartender acted like we were bothering her and she was so unfriendly.  Weird enough, I think that her attitude affected the way we felt about the food there...we paid over $40 for 2 burgers and 2 sodas and left feeling ripped off.  A restaurant can have the best food around, but it is the SERVICE that makes us keep coming back to Red Robin.  :)",

The 12 min. wait for a seat even though there was 9 free tables, 6 of which were in between stationed areas- the remaining 3 was probably closed off. 2. The server provided one refill for drinks. 3. Service was relatively quick, but server was not aware of terminology on their own menu. (I ordered \"bunless\" and printed on the menu, a note says, \"Order it BUNLESS, get your burger wrapped in lettuce.\" Yet she still asked me if I wanted my burger to be wrapped in lettuce.) This would normally warrant a 2 star rating but oddly enough this sub par service was not as bad as most of the places I've been to as of lately. I wanna say keep it up, but you can do better. Just think about food service in the 80's and 90's. They only looked for 10% gratuity but their excellence far exceeds today's standards.",
