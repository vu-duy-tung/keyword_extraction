    "text": "Ordered something and got something else (???)  We knew Benihana when it was located at the Hilton and it was always a treat to dine there. We also have one close by in Scottsdale and go there all the time.  The meal at Benihana on the strip was to be the highlight of our culinary disappointment expedition in Las Vegas. We thought to have reached rock bottom with Maggiano's and wanted to leave on a good impression. Benihana has always been good to us. Until today.  Before he started cooking, our cook explained that he personally prepared the food in the kitchen before coming to the table.  I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki. My chicken came with no Teriyaki. Big chunky pieces of unappetizing chicken. Gross!!! I told our cook and he said oops, I forgot. He called the waiter who brought me a little container of cold runny teriyaki sauce from the kitchen. It is not the same as when it is cooked with it!  My husband ordered the Benihana excellence with beef julienne (which he loves) and shrimp. When he was served with a piece of steak that came with a huge piece of fat (that the cook jokingly called Las Vegas bacon) my husband said this is not what he ordered. He knows what beef julienne looks like as he had ordered it many times before. We called the waiter to ask him what happened. He said this is the splash and meadow. So, not what we ordered!!  He cut us off saying, well this is meat and shrimp, this is the same thing, so what.  Before leaving, we talked to the manager (Mr Ralph Treszi) who basically did not care. He offered to make me another chicken teriyaki. What? when we are ready to leave? not interested. All he did was give me his card and tell me to call him before we go to Scottsdale next time and he'll ask the Scottsdale location \"to do something for us\". I do not care. I wanted is that he assumes the mistakes of his staff not make me act like a beggar and have another location assume his shortcoming. This is so pathetic!  Our cook made is obvious he loves to have tables of people cheering and clapping at his antics. Although we enjoy having fun, we are not cheering, screaming and clapping people and felt we were treated like 3rd world customers. Behind us there was a large table of people celebrating a birthday and he paid them more attention than our table.   This location is just plain greedy and unfriendly. We had the worse experience and I am going to contact headquarters about it.",

So we weren't seated until about 8 pm . Which is no good for a hungry pregnant women and a 10 month old. We sat and the chef and server were extremely nice ! They were attentive funny and even brought me a little birthday dish at the end of our evening. The food cooked on the grill tasted great but I did notice the white rice they gave everyone who didn't order fried rice was cold and kind of just looked like it had been sitting for awhile . My 10 month old dropped a dish on the floor and the staff was lighting fast at the clean up but when they brought us a new bowl of rice it was defiantly hot and fresh that time. ( side note I saw tons of kids there but don't know if I would say it's kid friendly like the hostess said I guess it depends on your kids you know them best and they do have a kids menu ) all in all I think 3.5 stars I guess I was expecting more for the 180$ bill but still a great night and the server and chef were excellent  .",

    "text": "I was at the Fashion Show mall Benihana corporate store on Wednesday, May 23, 2018.  The manager was totally disrespectful to me and my guest. The server said they had NO HOT WATER for tea. I asked them to boil water on the stove to bring hot water for the tea, they said they didn't have a pot to make it. What Japanese restaurant doesn't serve hot tea?!! **after reading numerous reviews (Candice T and Nan80) stated that they've also been told the hot water machine was broken, R E A L L Y?  This machine has not been replaced with even a Mr. Coffee machine that can make hot water? Don't you think a manager could have done something to get a new machine, coffee carafe or T-Fal to boil hot water meanwhile the hot water machine was being built in China and sent by pony express to his restaurant? Maybe he could have called Sparkletts to order a hot water dispenser unit with the 5 gallon hot water bottle on top. Being a manager he can't even manage water! This must be a scam this restaurant is pulling just so they won't have to provide free hot tea. They would prefer that you PAY for a drink.  The server brought some lemon wedges that  I requested. They were heaped on top of a soggy paper bar napkin- instead of using a small bowl. The lemons looked slimy and bent/used. The server delivered them from her hand without a plate under the lemons. I didn't use any of the lemons because I knew I would be sick. My guest asked the server to get a plate for the lemons. She said, \"we don't have plates.\"  The family who was seated at our table were extremely loud. After bringing these issues to the manager's attention, he said I was \"harassing him!\" Rather than deal with and fix the small problems, he immediately threatened to kick me out. I told him he didn't know what the word \"harass\" meant and that he should look it up in the dictionary. He called the mall security officers to remove us from the restaurant. This manager doesn't have any public relations skills nor is he respectful with guests.  The manager went to the table where we were seated and stood in front of this family yelling out loud to this family and others in the restaurant that I said they were loud. Everybody stopped talking to hear what he had to say. He intended to and did embarrass us. We were shamed as we left the restaurant with every guest staring at us as the security officers escorted us out. My guest never spoke to the manager to have any reason to be thrown out! The security officer told me that this manager has kicked out many guests in the past and also said he is not a nice person.  There are better restaurants in Las Vegas where you can get respectable service and the hot water you need. Neither my guest nor I consume alcohol to be accused of being kicked out for that reason.  I do NOT ever plan on dining at Benihana's again, you lost my business and that of my family and friends as I have already told them what happened.  Benihana doesn't care if a guest is publicly shamed or kicked out for doing nothing wrong. This manager is on a power trip. I suspect he threatened his employees not to say what happened when and if corporate investigates. They don't want to lose their jobs but they know that this manager bullies the guests by kicking them out by force. If you want to take a chance of being kicked out come to the Fashion Show Benihana, otherwise, enjoy a more peaceful restaurant.",

They will tell you the hot water machine is broken. They will not offer you anything else to substitute for it either even though is on their menu and it says included with your meal. They want you to pay for the drink.  My daughter went to eat there with her friends last month and no one got tea either they had to pay for the drinks.  I ordered the seafood diablo and asked if I can get the yakisoba noodles instead of the udon noodles but the server said NO they can't do that.  What's so hard about cooking with different noodles?  I should of just walk out but I didn't so it was my fault. The seafood diablo didn't taste good with the udon noodles so I didn't eat it and wasted my money. I'm just going to stick to Ohjah Japanese steakhouse and hibachi.  The food is way better and a lot cheaper!  Never again Benihana!",

We walked in and explained the awful experience we had just experienced with Sugar Factory and they were very nice and understanding of our frustrations and just made us feel a lot more welcomed. Since we were a walk in of 10 with no reservations, we had to wait 45 minutes which was expected. We grabbed drinks at the bar which were amazing. We met the most amazing and knowledgeable bartender, Jimmy! He was making hand crafted drinks and let us sample them and really knew how to start off our night right, very personable too! HUGE s/o to Jimmy! We were seated in exactly 45 minutes. The fun really began once we got to our table. The server was very welcoming as well. Our chef was Adam and he was AMAZING. He was SO funny and had us laughing the whole entire time!! The whole table of 10, ages ranging from 16 to 70 were tearing up and laughing non stop. He made the whole experience unbelievably fun and entertaining. They kept the drinks coming (since they knew it was my 21st) and everything that I had was spectacular. The food was amazing, very fresh and tasty. Adam really made the whole meal though so also a HUGE s/o to Adam he was the bomb!! It was one of the best parts of our trip and something all of my friends and family said they would never forget. We talked about it for days after. It was such an amazing experience and I truly want to thank everyone there for making me feel so special for my 21st and giving my friends and family an experience that we will never forget! HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend Benihana for great food and a great time!",

    "text": "I have always liked going to Benihana even had my son's Baptism reception at a different location...I do have to say though that I was very disappointed this time around...We made reservations for our birthday around 830 pm and the wait was short to be seated which was nice...Prior to being seated we had a drink at the bar for a birthday toast...Ryan was our waiter and he was great, very friendly made us laugh and even helped take our group pics...My twin and I were excited that we were spending our birthday together after living in 2 different states it had been at least 8 years that we celebrated together...So this meant alot to us and couldn't wait to get dinner started...Our chef Jocelyn arrived and she didn't even introduce herself, how do i know her name i had to read it so i knew who she was...She then proceeded to give us our sauces and started the show...Now every once in awhile it can be normal to drop your utensils, but she did it more than I expected...Then came the heart shaped fried rice, shrimp that she missed 2 of them in her routine but hey it happens...The entire time she is cooking everyone at the table is either staring at other tables to see what's so exciting or we are looking at eachother in wonder why she isn't interacting with us...This is our birthday it's suppose to be exciting not us hear other people's reactions to thier chefs tricks etc for thier birthday celebration...It was so bad I had to make funny puns to make people laugh at our table...Normal chit chat is fine but when you're just cooking and we can't hear anything you say cause you aren't being vocal doesn't make the experience worth while...You know its bad when you have to look at other peoples table to get the Benihana experience...Well she finished cooking and left the table and we just looked around like okay that was horrible...We tried to make the best of it by saying it's our birthday and talked to her husband an my boyfriend to keep us in the birthday mood...We gave her the benefit that maybe she was new and our table was just blah...Nope as we were finishing our dinner she set up camp at the table next to us...We watched as she did the same thing and the table looked just as bored...One lady even had her elbow on the table and just was resting her chin on her hand...Then what happens ohhhh she does the onion volcano and we all look at eachother and realize she didn't even do that for us...Even if we missed it while we had to watch other tables that was pretty sad cause that's something you always wanna see them do...I can go on and on about our experience but overall it was just horrible...We spent all this time hyping ourselves up only to be disappointed...Our birthday only comes once a year and when you have a bad experience on the day of your birthday it just makes it worse...There was at least 4 other birthdays that night as we celebrated and those other tables had waaaaaay more fun than us...If we wanted to just sit down and watch someone cook for us we could have asked our husband/boyfriend lol...Benihana you didn't make us feel special in anyway what so ever on our birthday...The worst part is this experience made me wanna write a review cause it bothers me so much cause I haven't written a review in years...That is the end of my rant slash review on a place that has always been a great experience but they just let the wrong chef entertain us on our birthday...",

When we came to the table they hadn't even set up enough seats to accommodate to the 14 so we had to squeeze in 3 more chairs to a completely full table. The hostesses/waitresses were very rude from the entire time, it took a long tome for the hibachi chefs to come out but once they did, our dinner became a lot better because they were very funny and outgoing-that was the only good thing about the dinner-. We all had ordered 6 course meals and weren't provided with desert, and after telling the GM about our experience there wasn't much relief. After working at Gordon Ramsay Steak I know how customer service works in the food business. Never going again terrible experience and ok food. Also after watching every other table sing happy birthday to the people who had birthdays they did not sing happy birthday to our birthday girl. 21 is a big one and Benihana's did a great job of making her feel unimportant. PS my friend didn't even get Her ID checked and it was her 21st....",

    "text": "I'm only giving 1 star because I have to. If based on the girls at the front only I would give a 5. They were very quick to open the doors for us and have us seated at our table within 5 minutes of walking in. From there on was a disappointment.  Our server (Kylie? Kaylie?) didn't understand what Sweet Shrimp was which is basically live (sometimes frozen) shrimp sashimi where the head is deep fried. Very basic dish where sushi is served. She gave me a blank look and told me she'd never heard of it. The other Benihana serves Sweet Shrimp but this location doesn't. Okay, fine, but what bugged me was she could've at least offered to check at the sushi bar if they have it or not before flat out denying it's existence. She kept giving me looks like I made it up from out of nowhere.  I asked for a raspberry iced tea. When I usually order it, it comes sweetened. This one wasn't and when I asked if there was a sweetened one and she gave me a confused look again. What? You haven't heard of such a thing either? Strike One. Minutes later, same server proceeded to stand behind my back with a fellow coworker and speak loudly: \"I've never even heard of that. Sweet Shrimp?? Do you know what that is?\" Not in a very nice tone. I turned to looked at both of them behind me and they both separated in different directions, ending the rude conversation. Strike 2. Now onto our chef, Charlie. She was a real sweet heart. Very nice to all of us and the kids. Engaged in appropriate conversations. Made the best out of cheesy jokes. The only thing: Took her almost 2 hours to finally get the last of my meal onto my plate. By then my rice had gotten cold and just plain hard. My filet was ordered medium rare. No pink center from what I saw. The taste was basically just salt and pepper, nothing special.  I was so happy with my experience at the original Benihana on Paradise rd so I really wanted this one to be just as good but because of the bad start with my Server, the rest of the experience just went down the toilet.  Overall, I will not come back. I'd rather drive a little further down to the original benihana down the way from the strip. This new location needs a lot more training. Cook needs to time themselves better. Server needs to offer to check up on an item if \"she's never heard of it.\" If you've never heard of it....how do you know it's not served there? It could've been an off the menu item like a lot of sushi restaurants do. No offer, just plain No. Oh well. Good luck to this location but I should've known it wasn't going to be that great since it's located in a mall.",

Had to call the waitress to take our order and wait for drinks..Salad and soup arrived at the same time. No dressing on the salad. Had to call her over again for salad dressing. Food came out FINALLY and we had no ginger sauce or mustard sauce AND NO rice. By the time we got sauce our food was stone cold. Asked for a manager and the only thing he offered was to remake our food..This is Vegas and I have things to do other than wait another 20 minutes for a hot meal..The manager said he was sorry and said he would give me a discount..HMMM..We paid $40 a meal and he took the price of the drinks off  A whole $14 dollars off",

Throughout my time there, I overheard one of the employees (I'm guessing as she was cleaning up plates and going into the back a lot...she was a young Hispanic girl) speak about someone named Ralph who I'm guessing is another employee there. She was speaking in Spanish about how he's \"stupid and an asshole\" and trying to come with ways to get him fired. Now this is very unprofessional to hear while I'm trying to enjoy my meal. And then I go to the restroom and come back to see that my half eaten meal that i was still working on was cleared. I was sitting in the corner so i understand it could have been mistaken as it was pushed to the side needing to be cleared. However my boyfriend said he tried to tell her that I was still eating, says she looked at him like she didn't understand what he was saying and proceeded to take my plate. I will return, however this ridiculous. I asked my chef what her name is and he told me Marilyn. So Benihana, please try to do better than to hire young ladies like this.",

We ordered a couple rolls, Gyoza and Karaage Chicken along with a Blue Ocean Punch Bowl, White Peach Sake Sangria and Lychee Blossom.  Food and drinks were delicious.  Service was great although I do wish our bartender would have let us know she was leaving at shift change.  She disappeared and we didn't know she was gone for the day.  I would have liked to close our tab before she left.    The main downfall of this happy hour for me is they will only let you order the fishbowl for 2.  That's pretty lame, especially in Vegas.  You can get fishbowls up and down the strip so not sure why they are so uptight about it.  It is not particularly strong either.  The bartender said it was and told stories about people drinking half and disappearing into the bathroom they were so wasted.  Maybe if you are a rookie or weigh 80lbs.  I drank the whole thing and got buzzed but wasn't wasted by a long shot.  The bartender did end up letting me order the fishbowl and my friend order another cocktail but it took some persuading and the promise of acting like we were sharing if a manager came by.",

Hilarious, immaculate chef (best Benihana cooked meal by far, hands down!), entertaining and engaged his table. Truly an extra bonus to the perfectly cooked steak, veggies, seafood, rice & atmosphere.  We had a reservation for 7pm and were sat around 7:10pm. Everything was ordered and delivered promptly. Tony took roughly an hour and 15 minutes with our table. It was nice to not feel rushed. He multi-tasked like a champ. It was also apparent that he made his \"show\" age appropriate, but his personality was still able to shine through.   When I return to this location, I will only request Tony!  \"TONY- TO NEW YORK\" \"SAVANNAH OOOOH NAH NAH\"  We love you Tony, much love!",

We found there was a Benihana on the open table app and were able to make reservations in a snap. It was mid-week, but we were able to join a table with some others in a small party. They gave us all plenty of space and didn't overcrowd the table or rush the service. Our drinks were good, and the chef was very kind about separating out my meal and using different utensils from the others who had shrimp (I have a shellfish allergy). It was a good experience for getting away from the convention crowd but not away from the walkable area.",

    "text": "First timers at one of the most popular teppanyaki food chains, had to say the experience was definitely a great one!  It's located on the strip-side of the Fashion Show Mall, only accessible from the outside. The exterior and interior design is very modern, clean with the infamous red color scheme & shiny, flat top tables. We walked in and were immediately seated as we had a reservation for our larger group.  Our server brought out of a tray of individual forks & kindly explained the menu since we've never been. She also introduced our chef, Johnny, and that he would be out shortly.  We were served our soups & salads, which were very good, btw.. & our chef appeared with his cart, ready to put on the show. He introduced himself as \"Magic J\" since \"Magic Mike was already taken.\" You can quote him on that LOL.  Here's the breakdown (only including my & my hubby's orders):  Onion Soup (5/5): Very flavorful broth & different from the miso soup most Japanese restaurants provide as a side.  Side Salad (5/5): IDK WHAT IT IS ABOUT THAT DANG DRESSING, But it is, how do you say, \"Fire?\" Crisp veggies, just enough salad dressing that doesn't weight down the greens & still light enough to have before the main course.  Chicken Fried Rice (3/5): You could honestly make this at home. It's chicken breast fancily sliced and diced on the flat top & added in w/ veggies, scrambled egg, garlic butter & rice. It tastes good, don't get me wrong.. just nothing out of the ordinary.  Shrimp Appetizer (4/5): Shrimp sauteed in their garlic butter. It was definitely plump, & juicy.   Vegetable Appetizer (4/5): Zucchini, onions & mushrooms. Very simple, and flavorful. Sauteed in garlic butter, salt/pepper, & soy sauce. A good accompaniment to the meat.  My order was the Hibachi Steak (5/5): Simple rib eye, S&P, garlic butter. Cooked perfectly, nice & medium.. omg. It was good. Not to DIE for.. but it was really good.  Hubs got the Teriyaki Steak (5/5): Steak was cut a little more thin, and then cooked in teriyaki sauce. Plain & simple, but it was definitely tasty!  Overall, you're paying for the experience of having an awesome, entertaining chef that our party had. Peeking around, I think other tables were jealous because they didn't seem to having as much fun as we were having. If you ever go to Benihana's at Fashion Show Mall, please request for Magic J because he was so funny & made our experience the most memorable. Will definitely be going back!",

    "text": "Where to start... The food quality At this location was the worst I've ever had at a Benihana.. The server was always MIA.... She took our order and hardly came back.. First off was the onion soup it  was served below half the the soup bowl, then the salad came old and wilted and barely any.. One of the salad had hair in it.. So I asked the server about the servings of soup and salad how small of portions they where... She said it was a corporate thing that the servings are now smaller..  One of the salad had hair in it, the manager came and started to go threw the salad when it was obvious hair was in the salad.. He said he was checking to see if it was ginger...   Now getting to the food.. I had Ocean treasures witch was a lobster,shrimp and scallops... The lobster shell was already cooked before it came to the table, the meat was soft and mushy.. The shrimp where just old and nasty looking..  The cook Calvin was pretty good , but he cooked the food backwards, our veggies came out last... Normally they cook them first with the fried Rice...  The cook also wanted to give us our fried rice on our plate instead of the bowl they normally come in.. we insisted to have it served in the bowl...he also under cooked the chicken breast  that came in the meal pink inside...  We where a party of 6 and all had drinks,appetizers along with our meals...  Bottom line is we had really bad service and food quality was bad.. The cook  did his best but that was the best thing of the night..   I also work in the restaurant business and I know how hard it is when serving customers, but the service here I couldn't believe...  Never again... Sorry",

    "text": "**CONSUMER ALERT - EMPLOYEE STATED THEY ARE BUYING THEIR MEAT FROM LOCAL ALBERTSONS GROCERY STORES DUE TO SHORTAGES FROM THEIR SUPPLIER CISCO - I'M NOT SURE WHICH IS SCARIER!**  Okay so here starts the saga of our Christmas day dinner at Benihana on the Las Vegas Strip. We arrive mid afternoon and upon entering the restaurant, a distinct smell of thick grease and old fish wafts through the air. It's as if they had no ventilation fans pulling out the air from all of the cooking at the Teppan tables. We are seated within a few minutes and then the saga began.  Our drink orders and meal orders are first taken by the kind waitress; and then the soup and salad comes out. The soup was luke-warm in temperature; and the salad dressing tasted off this time around (overly garlicky and bitter), and not the typical amazing taste.  Out comes our 20 something Benihana chef, a very kind gentleman. As he prepares the food, most of his tricks fail during the show. I asked if they are still professionally trained; to which he stated that old retired Benihana corporate chefs came in and gave the new hires a couple of lessons. Really! These guys used to be master chefs trained by Benihana in Japan. Now we get young millennials with a couple of chop chop lessons; scared of the knives flying into your children's faces!  He further stated that they were going to be super busy that night, and that they were already running out of food. When I asked why he said that they only get their deliveries on Mondays; and since it was Christmas that they didn't get their delivery.  I then asked when the meats he was preparing for us came in; to which he replied that Sysco came last Monday. I then asked what they were going to do about the shortages that night; to which he replied that managers and employees were being sent around to Albertsons grocery stores to buy up their meats. Are you kidding me I responded! We're paying over $300. bucks for Christmas and our meals are coming from Albertsons. He laughed and shrugged it off and kept cooking. BTW they were already out of Lobster by 2:30pm as the table behind us was being told during their introduction.  So now on to the food... The fried rice was soggy and mushy, the filet mignon was all lacking flavor; and even though prepared medium - was not tender at all! (Albertsons grade LOL). The shrimp all lacked flavor and was way overcooked, the hibachi veggies consisted solely of a mass of grilled onions. Made me think like I needed a hot dog to go along with them. The chicken was just weird and rubbery, and basically the entire holiday meal was a complete and utter joke - not to mention a waste of time. To top it all off, they forgot the 2 kids steaks; so when everyone was already eating, the kids just sat and waited like 15 more minutes to go find more steak. They probably had to get it out of the front seat of the employees car that had just gotten back from Albertsons.  To the management of Benihana; it is a sad day when I have to write such a horrific review of such a shitty holiday experience. Shame on you for not being prepared for your most important customers in Christmas day. Get your act together, and corporate best get theirs together as well; otherwise your rent will sooner rather then later far exceed your profits!  Thanks for a ruined Christmas dinner and robbing us of $300 bucks! I want to seriously forget about this shitty experience.  PS: Your green tea ice cream tasted like milk with no matcha flavor whatsoever!",

I'm so disappointed in the way JOSH handled our dress code attire situation, which in my opinion he could've been more polite and professional TO ME AND MY FRIENDS WHO LOOOOOVE BENIHANA and visit your other guys location more than four times a month! He was telling us that we could leave if we want to. Which I feel like the hostess should've addressed there dress code attire in the beginning. Which would have avoided this whole altercation. After explaining to JOSH that we REQUESTED the bar no table. He said you could leave but don't have to! And that the hostess was probably bUsy dOiNg sOMtHIng ELse? First of all where was my \"sorry\", \"I apologize for the inconvenience but it's our companies policy\" if he wouldn't have walked away while we were still questioning him. I wouldn't be writing this review. Someone need to have a word with JOSH ON HOW TO POLITELY HANDLE DIFFICULT SITUATIONS AND TO NOT WALK AWAY WHEN A CUSTOMER HAS A QUESTION. AND IF HE CAN'T DO THAT MAYBE HE SHOULDN'T BE MANAGER! And this is coming for someone who's worked in the food Industry and managed. Thankyou",

    "text": "We LOVE Benihana and have been to several locations repeatedly (Aruba, Florida, California). But this our first visit to the Las Vegas location at the Fashion Show mall. Although we were seated at 7:30 (time of our reservation) we waited for over an hour for our chef to come out to start preparing our food. The temperature in the restaraunt was stifling hot...and yes I know sitting around a hot table can make it warm but this was not our first time at a Benihana teppanyaki table! The chef tried hard to entertain us and he was quite good but he did manage to confuse our rice orders and my nephew ended up having to eat shrimp fried rice instead of the chicken fried rice he ordered. His entree was later placed on my sons plate (which had been eaten from) instead of his...thankfully we were all family!  And lastly his grand finale juggling act knocked over my husbands beer glass right off the table spilling beer all over him and sending broken glass everywhere. Most of the dinner we were surrounded by empty beer bottles and empty carafes and glasses because our server was no where to be found. I really don't blame the servers/chef...they just looked understaffed and they couldn't keep up with their busy restaraunt. We also left smelling like the teppanyaki table which again has never happened. Needless to say this was not the Benihana experience we have loved and enjoyed over the years. Overall the food was still very good and manager did discount our bill 15% but I don't think we would be visiting this particular Benihana location again.",

If you're going for your birthday, I recommend that you sign up on their website for their free membership...they give you a $30 voucher for your birthday. The establishment is fairly new and is conveniently located at the Las Vegas Fashion Mall. I do recommend that you make reservations ahead of time. We definitely can't wait to visit again soon!",

    "text": "I was at the fashion show mall in Las Vegas this past weekend and received very disrespectful service by the manager at the time, Ralph. My party and I had reservations and had promptly arrived 5 minutes before our reservation but we're refused to be sat down until 100% of our party was there. We had 90% of the party but were just waiting on 1 last person but Ralph refused and threatened to take our name off the waitlist if they weren't there in the next 15 minutes.   I understand Las Vegas is a heavily populated city and there must be annoyingly drunk people to deal with all the time, but Ralph has no right to disrespect and reject our business as he did. Also, I heard him say behind my back that if I were to go back and ask to be seated without the last person he would take our name off and ask us to leave the restaurant and refuse our services completely. I believe, whoever is in charge of Ralph, should have a conversation with him and advise him not to be rude to his customers. I go to Bennihana in Anaheim often and have never recieved service this bad",

I had a teppan steak that comes with fried rice and some vegetable. I enjoyed the Teppan performance.  The steak and vegetable were very good.  Fired rice was ok. I should try chicken fried rice next time. I want to  try shrimp and scallop next time. The downside I could not ignore was their dishes - greasy. I can see and feel it easily.  I asked the wait-person to change the dish, but unfortunately another one comes in  the same condition. I am sorry their dish washing machine is not good enough to clean up a dish.  At the same time, I am sorry their staffs are not aware of the greasy dishes. Also, we are the last customers seated at the teppan table, but we still wait for a while to the chef comes. I imagines other customers waited for such a long time...",

We waited well over an hour for a chef to come to the table and within the first 45 minutes we had only been served drinks (just water). The waitress was clearly high and several people at the table noticed as well. We waited so long for drinks that two people left during that time. The whole time we were waiting, the manger just walked around doing nothing and was completely oblivious to anything that was happening in the restaurant. When someone at the table asked him how long it would be before a chef came he had no idea and did nothing to go check. Kyle, our chef, was the only positive part of the experience. He tried to make the most of the situation when clearly we had been waiting for almost an hour and a half for someone to come. The food he made was delicious and he went above and beyond to try and salvage everyone's dining experience. Clearly, the manger did not care whatsoever about how his restaurant was being run, the service that was given, or even the sobriety of his employees.",

We were in Vegas for a Volleyball tournament and the girls wanted team bonding.  They asked if they could go to Benihana and I told them it would be hard but I will try and get reservations.  Let me start by saying I started with Lauren who directed me to Ruby.  Ruby was polite and so very helpful.  She was very skeptical on making the reservations for such a large party but I promised her I would make it as easy as possible if she would just grant the reservations.  She did.  We were all on time and from that point worked with Abby.  I can't say enough on how Abby helped with the seating and made everything so smooth.  She has a smile on her face and was genuinely happy to accommodate.  Our server was Jerrica, Jerrica was nice and we received drinks timely and she was calm and I truly have no complaints.  It was a lot and it didn't seem to faze her.  Then there was Calvin, our cook.  The food was AMAZING.. he was wonderful and very friendly.  We will be visiting Vegas again in April for another tournament and hopefully can get a reservation.  We all talked about how fantastic of a time we had.  I did as promised and made it easy for payment since the girls were at a completely different table.  They all paid with cash.  And last but not least... we were all pleasantly surprised that the girls were all given separate checks and was able to each pay their bill with cash and separately.  and to top it off we the parents were able to have separate checks as well.. GREAT!!! GREAT!!! Place.  Kuddos to this Benihaha's on Las Vegas Blvd.",

Our chefs name was Malik I believe. Nice, cool guy. It took 2 HOURS to finally get our full meal. By the time the steak was done, the rice and shrimp were COLD. And by that time the entire place had cleared out. All the cleaners were scrubbing, vaccuming and one of the ladies at our table slipped on the wet floor but luckily did not fall. Cleaning products laying everywhere. TWO HOURS for some white rice, steak and shrimp. Two hourssssss",

I think at the time they had been open for two months, and everything inside was really clean and well put together.   Our chef was John... and not sure if he was new or just nervous, but unfortunately he was a little sloppy in his presentation and dropped his utensils a few times. Otherwise, the rest of the night was great and the food was fantastic.   There's definitely a lot of steakhouse options available along the strip, but Benihana's is always a favorite and I'm much happier with this strip location over the Westgate location.",

Came here to meet a long lost cousin, the drinks were pretty good but the food was even better than I imagined especially the fried rice and the diablo sauce on our shrimp was the highlight of our tastebuds! Our chef wasn't particularly amazing but entertaining none-the-less and liked him because he was originally from where we're were from.  We really enjoyed our party and food except because of the seating arrangement was half circle it was hard to talk and hear everyone without having to turn our back on the next person... will definitely have to come back for some more of that awesome diablo sauce!",

We asked the lady how long more and if we could have a private room and she agreed to it, we just had to wait a little more.   Once we were about to be seated we were not seated in the private room so we questioned the girl who brought us to the table and she said they don't have a private room.   So I asked the lady I spoke to and she said we'd have to wait and some other stuff but we were seated soo i just let it go and instead asked if we could do a birthday surprise singing thing for our friend. She said yeah and that she'll tell our server.   When dinner was done there was still no surprise so I asked the server about it and he said he didn't know anything about it.  Now when we get our bill. None of us has any idea that it would be an add on for fried rice so it was a surprise to all of us. We never saw it on the menu clearly.   Overall horrible experience.",

It was tremendously hot in the establishment to where two ladies ordered drinks and decided to just up and leave because they were uncomfortable. Our chef was very entertaining but I think he focused too much on another couple that loved their salt because ALL of my food was tremendously oversalted. Portions have gone down tremendously. Usually, I walk out with my goodie bag. This time, my husband and I both finished our plates. I also look forward to the soup at the start of my meal. The soup was luke warm. That made me question their sanitation of the kitchen. Soup should not be left at low temperatures... Also, what happened to the hot towel at the start of the meal to cleanse your hands? Will I be back? No.",

So first thing I would like to point out if you are coming here for a birthday go to the website a couple of days before hand and sign up for their Rewards program or something it's called Chef something and it basically gives you a free voucher of up to like $30 but you have to do it beforehand because it does take like 24 hours for them to send you the coupon. So I thought that was a pretty cool feature and the waitress actually told us about it when we arrived so, I thought that was really nice that they did that although we didn't get to use it at least we know for future references. So we arrived around 6 and it didn't take long for us to get a table we were sat at one of the grill top tables with about three other parties each of us had two people in our party. Our table was pretty chill and everybody was really nice. The waitress  took our orders and our Chef came out an executed everybody's request, and prepared some really delicious plates for us. Some things that really stood out for me was the spicy chicken fried rice I could honestly just order that by itself it was so good my chicken was excellent my steak was excellent the proteins were just by far the best and the grilled zucchini was amazing I've never ate zucchini before and now I'm like obsessed with that it was definitely more food than I could eat so I did take some home. The whole experience took a little longer than we had expected I think we were there for about two hours so we did skip out before dessert because we had plans for that night. I have been craving Benihana's since I've gotten back home and I cannot wait to have some more, the next time I'm in town. And the food was so good I never even got a chance to really take pictures. Oh Beni, until we meet again!",

For $50 I was presented with a full 8-piece roll of moist and excellent Spicy Tuna; a huge heap of perfectly salted Edamame; Benihana Onion Soup; Benihana Salad; Hibachi Shrimp appetizer; Hibachi White Onions, Mushrooms, and Zucchini; Hibachi Chicken Fried Rice; a Samurai Treat of medium-rare Filet Mignon and Colossal Shrimp; Seafood and Meat Dipping Sauces; endless hot Japanese Green Tea, and Chocolate Ice Cream.    The Onion Soup with Mushrooms and Green Onions was very good, as was the salad with Cherry Tomatoes, Iceberg Lettuce, carrot slivers, and Ginger Dressing.  Requested low-sodium Soy Sauce was unexpectedly presented in a white ceramic spouted dish.  A touch of class!  And extra ginger for the sushi was quickly supplied.    The Benihana Signature Chicken Fried Rice was nicely soy flavored, and the grilled vegetables, tender Filet, and meaty shrimp perfectly seasoned.  Seating at a hibachi grill was comfortable in the sleekly modern dining room accented in red-cushioned chairs.  We sat with 6 sociable men from Germany who were staying in a penthouse suite at the Mirage.  And service by Unique was outstanding.     Great cooking of top quality ingredients by our grill master yielded a superior teppanyaki meal.  Only too many dropped knives and missed shrimp catches prevented this from being a 5-star experience.  4-1/2 sparkling stars overall!",

I've got the pineapple coconut and rum drink and it's just like drinking pineapple slash on water and rum. I had to ask them to add lime for me so I can taste some flavor  $24 for spicy chicken hibachi set.

Upon arriving to our table we looked down at one of our  plates and noticed that it was dirty. Then on both of our napkins we noticed large dry stains and crust. We were disgusted but fortunately our dinner was turned around quickly once our server came round and we were given amazing service! Not only was our waiter fabulous but but we received amazing treatment from our cook Kyle! But.. as we were seated watching our cook we noticed small black lines on our shrimp. We were  mortified by the fact that none of the shrimp had been deveined and had to check every bite to make sure we didn't eat the poop line!! Although the service was unmatched, we unfortunately were left with a bad taste in our mouth because of the seemingly terrible sanitation practices. We did not expect to go to Benihana's and receive dirty plates, napkins, or shrimp that hadn't been deveined....",

Benihana is my boyfriend's favorite restaurant, so we go to Benihana a lot. At home and where ever we are that there is one. Lol So trust me when I say this chef was great! Usually my boyfriend is very particular about how his Beni's is cooked but last night he was speechless. Which is why I knew I had to yelp this. Lol My Benihana addict was veryyyyy pleased. Food seasoned and cooked perfectly to how we liked it. We will be heading back home today, but the next time we're in Las Vegas, I'm sure we will be back. Thanks Chef Nelson! For the great food.",

We arrived on time and waited over a half an hour to see people get seated in front of us who did not make a reservation. The chicken was undercooked and the cook packed up before my wife could ask him to put it back on the grill. This may have been an isolated incident but there is really no room to make that kind of mistake with chicken when you're paying close to $100 for two people. The waitress was great and always made sure our drinks were at least half full, which is important after walking all day in Vegas.",

Our server gave us free edamame appetizer for the wait which I thought was not necessary but I did appreciate him letting us know the reason for the wait. I ordered the Ocean Treasure (lobster, scallops, and shrimps), my husband got the Hibachi Tuna Steak, my mom got the hibachi chicken and my dad the filet mignon. The soup was really good and the salad fresh. We all enjoyed our meals and the friendliness of our lady chef. She was very engaging and not just concerned with her performance/show. Our server and assistant was very attentive. He was always refilling our drinks and asking if we need anything. Service was top notch! My seafood dish all tasted heavenly. Everything was cooked to perfection. My dad's filet was perfectly medium and my husband's ahi was perfectly seared. I tried the hubby's tuna and it was so flavorful and lovely. My mom did not finish her food (got full from the appetizer, soup, and salad) and had it to go. I tried it a couple of days later and it was still really good. The chicken and steak meal came with ice cream which was a good way to end a great experience. Oh and the Mango Lemonade was AWESOME!!! It also has free refills :-)  We enjoyed our time at this Benihana because of the extra care of our server and chef. My parents have been here 4 times since they opened and they plan to come back again. We will definitely visit again when we are in town.",

    "text": "So although I used to live in a condo just a few hundred yards away from fashion show mall, I never even realized Benihana was inside.  I stumbled across it on memorial day weekend when I stayed at the Encore across the street. I ate there for lunch at the semi-outdoor bar seating and then decided to go back a week later and sit inside at a grill. So I have to write this review for both.   As you may notice in many of my reviews, I often look for 'cleaner' food options. Benihana is a great place to get a macro nutrient friendly, nutrient dense meal. They provide the macro nutrients their website and even the total calorie count for each dish on the menu. These are huge bonuses for me.  When I went for lunch, I had steak and chicken, brown rice and steamed veggies. I asked that they hold any extra oil. Oddly enough, my dish took about an extra three or four minutes to come out from the kitchen because of that request. So my cousins who were with me got their meals ahead of me. That was no big deal though. The meal was delicious, and something clean just like I would prepare at home except I got to be out enjoying with family.   Following week, I went with my wife and her coworkers. We got a grill seat and the chef did a really good job. I grew up going to Hibachi style restaurants because my parents were big fans of them. Although I was skeptical based on the readings, this was the best one I have ever been to. (Based on 5 or so different hibachi style businesses visited)   The service was excellent. The food was fresh and very very tasty. The environment at these type of restaurant is always really cool and it's conducive to socializing with friends and family over a meal.   One negative I would say was the sushi roll I got for the appetizer. Six pieces at that price were absolutely not worth it. And the sushi was really average.   But other than that I highly recommend you give this place a shot!",

It's actually called the Teppanyaki Grill but for the white people out there I'll keep it simple.  If you go any time before 3pm the lunch special includes your choice of meat,  veggies,  fried rice and soup.  Great for when you just need a quick cheap bite",

    "text": "I love this chain and generally count on consistent and reliable service, food whenever I come here. Came here after a pool party where we enjoyed happy hour at the bar with the best bartender Jimmy! (They have happy hour on Saturdays which is a rare find!) He endured our antics and bad jokes and even let us try out a new drink he was testing. The special Jimmy Jalapeno margarita is perfect if you want a little kick at the end without being overbearing.   Our chef, Adrian was very funny, knew more than the standard tricks of the Benihana trade and helped make our dinner very enjoyable. If you are looking for a fun bite to eat on the strip and enjoy a nice sit down meal I would recommend this Benihana as my party and I had a delightful experience.",

Highly recommend getting tony as your cook because he is hilarious and will make the night memorable.   My steak was cooked medium rare and it was fantastic! Our appetizers though were not really worth the price. The sushi roll was simple with just rice and seaweed around it. But that was $6 and we got 6 tiny pieces of shrimp for $9. That was really not worth it. But our meal was worth every bit! Jasmine made sure our waters were always filled. It was her fourth day so she didn't know much about sushi or the appetizers. But she was still nice & welcoming. Highly recommend the fried rice! The show he puts on is super cool! The rice is also tasty.",

    "text": "Alright so Benihana is definitely viewed as the king of hibachi chain serving up entertainingly prepared dishes.  As a local I stay clear away from the strip unless we have guests in town and well based on my yelp reviews, MY HOME IS ALWAYS FILLED WITH VISITORS. So as the hostess with the mostest I decided to try Benihana again and ditch Giesha House or Ohjah (my normal go-to's) I must admit I forgot what to expect because from here because I've avoided going to the run down original location at Westgate (last time I went it was called the Hilton).  Our chef was Hans and well the food tasted great. The quality of food was delicious and onion soup was amazing! I must note the lobster was cooked to perfection and not rubbery like I've had at our places. As for our chef, he definitely lacked the entertainment of your normal hibachi dinner don't get me wrong the fried rice heart beat was beating and the volcano was there but the personality and humor was cooked right out of our chef tonight. So we lived vicariously through our neighbors table who's laughs echoed throughout restaurant.   Any who, the scenery amongst the restaurant is beautiful and the location is right next to Sugar Factory right across from the Wynn. My family and I walked off our calories across the bridge to the mini wannabe Bellagio fountain at the Wynn and listened to some old school Frank Sinatra! What a \"Wynn\"!",

It took 48 minutes until the appetizers arrived! Then the cook comes ten minutes after it! He starts doing his thing and it's entertaining and all but we literally had to wait for over an hour for our food!   I'm not sure about you, but to us, that was incredibly weird and ridiculous. That was the longest I've ever had to wait for food.   But again, the FOOD was great and the cook was actually pretty cool.   I guess just work on..time?",

    "text": "Less than zero stars for this place. WORST restaurant experience I've had in a long time. We got a reservation for 2 at 7:15 PM for 7:45 PM, arrived on time, ordered a drink at the bar, table ready before I got it. We were led to a back room type of Hibachi Table area with 2 eight-seat tables, I should have refused that table then... Within 10 minutes, it was hot a hell at that table, apparently they had recently walled off those 2 tables by installing some cabinets that essentially separated them from the main open seating area, therefore cutting off any air circulation... Complained to the General Manager, Sabrina Schafer, she said she would get a fan set up to blow circulating air into our area... Well, the area was so hot, and came in waves, that everyone was super uncomfortable, and after we had appetizers, and salads and such, it's now 9:30 PM, chef had barely started cooking ! I went back to the General Manager, Sabrina Schafer, and gave her the riot act, as I was livid by this time, as I and many others at the table we so hot, we couldn't imagine staying to eat once the chef did finish cooking, especially since the single fan was turned to the OTHER table !!! I understand the position of the General Manager having to parrot the company line, BUT, trying to tell us some people like it that hot, is insulting to everyone's intelligence, even hers ! My Daughter had to pull me away from that \"conversation\" with the General Manager, I was so pissed, and shortly after, she came back to reassess the situation and in 5 minutes, declared to the entire table that everyone's meal would be comped and did apologize, to her credit... While I appreciate the difficult position she is in to have to seat people at those tables, with NO air circulation, NO air conditioning, BUT, all the fan did when it was pointed at our table, was to leave our clothes and hair smelling like the cooking oils from the grille, and left us with our eyes burning from the smoke off the grille blowing in our faces...fan never did provide any cooling.... We did NOT come to this Benihana for a freebie, we came for an early New Years celebration dinner, only to be completely disappointed with the entire experience... We ended up leaving with our main course to-go, knowing full well it wouldn't taste nearly as good at home, but my Daugther said my face was so red from the heat, and she was SO hot and eyes burning, we just had to get out of there, as we were not accommodated with a different table in the open-air portion of the restaurant, which by the way, was perfectly cool, perfect for cooking in front of patrons... They knew in advance they had this problem with these tables, yet continue to seat people at them, go figure... This will most likely keep me from ever entering another Benihana anywhere, anytime, ever... Abusrd, but at least we can have a good laugh in the future, as my Daughter said, \"Hey, we can always say, Hey, remember that time we went to Benihana, LOLLLL???",

My first experience here was last Christmas Day... our waitress spilled a drink on me but the food was fantastic as usual. I was very disappointed 2 nights ago. Our party of 6 sat at the bar initially then were seated at the hibachi grill... that's when everything went down hill. My eyes immediately started to burn from the smoke from the grills. This location could really use some air inside. At the end of dinner I had to get up from our table and walk outside. My food was boxed up while I was outside nearly in tears from my eyes burning. After getting in the car all I could smell was the onion smokey smell from the restaurant. Both myself and my husband smelled horrible. I had to wash my clothes immediately, take my husbands clothes to the cleaners the next morning, and the worst part is 2 days later as I am writing this my purse reeks of the smokey onion smell... it's horrible. I felt sorry for our friends that were staying in a hotel... what could they do about the smell in their clothes except just deal with it. I tried to heat my leftover food up the next day and it was tasted like crap. It was smokey and tasted exactly like the scent of the smoke. Ended up putting it in the trash outside due to the smell also. Something needs to change with this location, if you want your guests come back and enjoy the experience and be smoke free when they leave. This is ridiculous... your employees must stink after work every day, and this can't be to safe to ingest this on a daily basis. I won't be coming back to this location to leave smelling like this again, and do a better job with your employees who wash the dishes. The entire table had to be given new plates that were not dirty",

Just curious if she's that way with all of her guests? She left for about 15 minutes. When she did come back she didn't even apologize. Another waitress broke a bottle that went flying everywhere... I got up to go the bathroom and glass was in my shoe. I mentioned it to the manager on site and he brushed it off as it was no big deal. He never came over to see if anyone was injured, or if cut by flying glass... The bottle hit the back of the chair that another guest was sitting in. That entire experience made me not want to go back to Benihana's ever! Not just that one, but none! It's overrated if you ask me. That place will NEVER see me in it! Oh, and we were given some free appetizers cards for our next visit. There will be no next visit.Corporate needs to come down and have a training class on how to treat customers. Everyone is not looking for a free meal! And we still tipped the waitress... I just don't like how the manager down played that whole glass flying incident. I could've really cut myself had I not felt something poking my foot. Ok, rant over! Never again! I'll be going to Katsua, or Geisha House, hell Panda Express gives better service!",

    "text": "First off I've been to Benihanas before and I really enjoy going there.  The place here in vegas was nice. We had reservations and so when we arrived we were seated quickly.  The waitress was very nice and hospitable. The chef was also funny nice and good at what she was doing. The two stars I am giving however are because the restaurants restrooms were out of order and we were told we had to go inside the mall or plaza to use them. I saw the waitress speaking to the manager about it he made eye contact with me but never apologize for the inconvenience.  So after walking my son to the restroom by the time we got back our food was cold. Also the food (at least ) the beef was somewhat chewy and didn't taste good. My daughters then had to go use the restroom and again the inconvenience. So I will go back to Benihana's but not to the one in Las Vegas.  I'll try once again closer to home hopefully that goes well and I can recommend Benihana's again.",

Then she disappeared waited another 20 minutes for ice cream and never brought our  green tea. I had to asked the manager Dj on duty if he can find our waitress thia .The manager Dj tried to give us some free appetites coupons we explained to him we didn't want anything free but some good service. After the manager Dj finally located  our waitress Thia finally came out of hiding just to collect the bill and stated to me that I was a really funny guy, but didn't have time for my shit and pointed to your watch, which displayed a piece of shit on her watch. Manager Dj was informed of this incident and all he replied was I'm sorry to hear that. After spending much money on dinner the least they can provide is good service. The only good thing of the dinner was our chief Arron great guy very funny. Please take my advice to anyone going to this Benihana stay away.",

We were seated immediately, but it was over 30 minutes before the chef showed up to the table. An employee was having a large celebration that evening and 5 chefs were at the employee 's table. So even though we had reservations - the employee's table got service and we did not! Because they were so late to our table, we barely were able to eat our entree's, much less get our dessert or have the Birthday song sung to my daughter. We had to run out to make it to our show in time! This is not how you treat customers! This was very stressful for my daughter on a day that was supposed to be special. We spent a lot of money on tickets, airfare and hotel and instead of having a fun evening at Benihana's all we got was poor treatment and stress. I will never return to a Benihana restaurant and I would not recommend that you eat here if you have any other plans for the evening.",

The service was fine although our waiter could've been more present and the place was nicely decorated and clean, even down to the bathrooms. However, the food left much to be desired. The soup and salad were good. My shrimp was good as well. The rice, however, was hard and not seasoned well. It was also cooked first and immediately put on our plates, which meant that it was cold by the time our meat was cooked. Every other Hibachi restaurant that I've been to has allowed the rice to continue to cook while preparing the meat so as to keep it hot. Duh, right! Well, that didn't happen here. Also, the two sauces they provided were very odd. They looked to be the same as what is provided at every other Hibachi restaurant but were ultimately gross. The deep fried sushi that we ordered was also cold and not very good. This location was also hard to find (it took us more than 10 minutes of walking in circles due to their lack of a large sign.) We won't be back.",

    "text": "Let me paint you a picture. We arrive as a group of 11, brimming with happiness and anticipation of a delicious dining experience. The group is enjoying their final spring break as college students, excited for a bonding experience that will serve as a fitting pregame to the night ahead.   We arrive at 5 minutes before our reservation, one we made weeks ahead of time, and are forced to wait for 40 minutes before we are allowed to be seated. During this time, the restaurant allows a homeless man to enter and ask every single guest in the waiting room for money. He smells bad, although not worse than the food itself. The waitress assures we will be seated shortly, and continues to rip her juul quietly.   Finally, we are brought to our table and allowed to begin the dining process. The waitress proceeds to get the order wrong several times, then proceeded to get the worst cook I've ever seen in my life. He tells the girls in our group to \"not be a woman\" when making decisions about their food, took two hours to make our food, and was an all around poop infused bath bomb dinner throughout our meal. No surprise since the 18% tip was already included in the bill which arrived a cool 2 hours and 45 minutes after our reservation time. \"Never come to Benihana in a rush,\" he says, after extensively detailing how much he enjoys procuring cheap hookers.  I ordered the fillet mignon and it tasted like pepper. If you want the Benihana experience with none of the stress just pour a container of pepper in ur mouth and listen to the trump grab her by the p**** video on repeat. Do not come here.",

Our waiter kept disappearing and we had to ask him multiple times for everything. Everyone at the table complained about him, even the chef. There was a point in time where he didn't come around for at least 20 minutes.   In addition to the horrible service, the food quality wasn't up to the normal Benihana standard and taste. We spent $200 on dinner and it wasn't even worth half that. The rice had a weird taste and the steak seemed like very low quality compared to what they normally serve. On top of that, I'm wondering if this location has an issue with ventilation because you leave smelling like the restaurant and it's so strong! It was so bad this time that my eyes were burning while they were cooking. This has never happened to me at any other Benihana location.    During my visit the time before, my friend and I had to send our meals back to have them replaced because the rice had that weird taste and the steak and shrimp looked old. The manager came out and agreed that something wasn't right. The new meals looked \"normal.\"  They have inside and outside tables at this location. Their bar overlooks the strip (ground level) and has an open window type area that stretches the full length of bar.",

I cant remember her name, but our chef gave us the worse service-ever!  The chicken fried rice, lacked soy sauce and flavor. When she served it, the rice was  white throughout. I DID NOT pay for white rice! She forgot our kids shrimp appetizer, so it was the last thing she cooked. She said, \"oh, my bad\" and kept cooking, as if she didnt care. The shrimp that she did serve, was undercooked, and so were the veggies. The chicken was overcooked, and the steak was undercooked. This was the first time ever, I've packed up ALL my food to go. The next morning, I attempted to eat my food, and it was as nasty as the day before. I am very disappointed. This is where we chose to spend our family day, and it sucked! $170 down the drain. I am NOT happy!!",

    "text": "Well what can I say, who doesn't like Benihana. I did some research before reaching Vegas. Vegas has a really beautiful restaurant with a fountain and koi fish pond but this is not that one. This Benihana is located right on the strip next to Sugar factory. We were sat right away and waited for the rest of the table. The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean. There were a couple differences from Vegas than California's Benihana that weren't for the best, but in all the food was delicious. Our chef was talented and funny.. it was a gentleman's birthday at our table, so in honor of his birthday he made a twerking butt out of the rice. When your in Sin City gotta do things their way. I love how he cooked the zucchini, adding soy sauce and cutting them into bigger chucks than California. The things that I did not like was their salad.. the dressing was very chunky, seems like they just took the bottom of ginger sauce and threw on top but really no liquid to wet all the salad when mixed. And second I am a huge garlic fan; I always asked for garlic butter on everything. I asked, he said yea he does that. Well garlic butter wasn't on the zucchini( but it was still good) and the way he puts his garlic butter in doesn't give that much garlic taste.  I'm use to the chef putting directly in with whatever he's cooking. This chef would melt it on the side and the scoop up with his spatula to drizzle on the food... but like I said all in all I still enjoyed it.",

Grandson who is picky ate EVERYONES fried rice and kept saying \"yummm\" during the processes. We totally loved our Chef Spider Man! Ask for him...really a fantastic chef. Salmon grilled to perfection, fried rice enjoyed by a picky # year old, I now like shrimp...so much that I was willing to give him a room in my house (I'm a local now after decades in So. Cal). Darn didn't get his number. All seriousness, yes it's pricey, but you can share, they are very attentive in who wants what.   Last time I took my now grown up kids to a Benihana was in Hawaii when they were kids. I can't speak for the whole place but as long as Zach (Spider Man) is your guy, you will have a good time, plus FANTASTIC food.   A very memorable experience for a Mother's Day gift from my daughters and grandson.   Photos and videos to follow....I think that folks at the other tables wished they had Spider Man too",

If Benihana at the Fashion Show is your only option, I guess I'd recommend it, but if you can venture elsewhere, you should try Ohjah, Osaka, or one of the Valley's other options--unless you have PLENTY of time to eat!  I met a friend for lunch on a slow Wednesday during Restaurant Week. Can't beat $20 for soup, edamame, grilled shrimp, fried rice and veggies, and green tea ice cream! But it's a good thing I took the afternoon off, because my leisurely lunch turned into a two-and-a-half hour meal. (It didn't help that it took us 20 minutes to be seated even though we had a reservation.)  The food was fine, and our chef was fun and personable. But I wish our hostess had been more attentive, or at least had explained why the wait was so long with so many empty tables in full view.  I probably won't return to this location, especially with so many other options closer to home. And there is another Benihana at the Westgate just in case you're itchin' for hibachi and can't get too far off the Strip. (I've been there. It's good. And we didn't have to wait...)",

Everyone at the table was so hungry. The food wasn't served til after 7.  Service: 4/10  The food, on the other hand, was delicious! The fried rice is an all-time favorite of mine. You can never go wrong with Benihana's fried rice. I ordered the hibachi shrimp, which came with onion soup, salad, dipping sauces, veggies, and rice. It was amazing and I loved it.  Food: 10/10  I also ordered a lychee drink. It was a tad bit strong but still really tasty. I also sipped on my boyfriend's coconut mojito which was so yum!  Drinks: 10/10",

We all enjoyed the meal and you get excellent food, great portions and very competitive prices. We will return.  When making a reservation ask for Tony!",

This was the best experience I've had at a Benihana's restaurant by far and I've been to several. Our Chef \"John Mark\" was excellent and then some. The way he entertained us and had us smiling and laughing made our experience that much better. And the way he prepared our meals was even better, he asked us about how we liked certain things prepared and he also added a very special touch to each individual meal. I wish we could take him back to Atlanta to teach his counterparts. This experience was the best.",

Nice lady but she was struggling to stay on top of it. Our soup was luke warm and she forgot to bring out the salad. I eventually asked the chef while he was cooking our rice (which was dry as hell) and she finally brought it out. Towards the end of the meal the chef had to refill our glasses  himself  because she had not come back out to do so.   I have been to many Benihana's but I was not pleased with the overall experience here. The waitress even said she felt bad for giving us the bill ($120) because it was a lousy night. We arrived at 9:15 so it was not a full house at the time. I just think we had a inexperienced waitress and the lack of air conditioning did not help AT ALL!!",

    "text": "We came here to celebrate our wedding after hearing our favorite chef moved hibachi locations. We sat at one of the tables where they cook right in front of you.  It may seem rather expensive, but for everything you get and for the freshness of having everything prepared right in front of you, I say it's a rather good deal. The portions are nice and generous and the atmosphere is festive.   Thurston is AMAZING. We love how he seasons everything and we love his humor and personality. He did an amazing job at making sure our night was a memorable one.   The one drawback to the location is that it isn't very well built for noise, and there's nothing on the walls to absorb some of the sound. It's not necessarily a ruckus, but it's just difficult to hear much farther than the person next to you from all the cooking and conversation. It's just this hum of commotion. We didn't necessarily mind it though.   Good food seasoned and cooked perfectly. Wonderful dessert. The prices are comparable to most other restaurants like it in town. For locals, the drive is a bit of a pain, but it's worth it. We tried Ohjah on Rainbow not too long ago. It was okay, but the food was a bit bland and the chef wasn't very personable.    I highly recommend Benihana to anyone that's curious! You will not be disappointed.",

The wait time was a half hour but it ended up being even shorter. Overall, this is an excellent restaurant with a great location.  I am deducting one star for 3 small reasons: 1) In the past 6 months I have been to 4 other similar restaurants. The chef has performance at Benihana was the worst in comparison. This is probably due to the fact that we couldn't hear our chef over all the noise from the many other tables. 2) In comparison to other restaurants, the food is the same. It isn't anything special. 3) When we exited Benihana at about 9 pm, the Fashion Show Mall was closed. We had parked beneath and planned to shop after our meal. We are locals and even the mall near us is open past 9 so we figured the mall on the Strip would be too. For locals, it really isn't worth making a trip to that part of the Strip for dinner.  Unless you are comparing this to another Teppanyaki place, you will not be disappointed.",

Got here at 8pm on a Tuesday night and couldn't be seated until 8:30. Fine...A few drinks later, we were at our table, but a chef didn't show up until an hour later! Sitting in front of an empty grill for that long while you hear everyone else's onion choo-choo trains and birthday tambourines around you in that fragrant environment is just torture.  Our chef Dominic got everything going in short order, but seemed a little nervous as the other big party at our table had a ton of obnoxious requests for extras and particulars. Poor guy. We did ask him to skip most of the tricks so we could eat, but he did make us some twerking booty cheeks with the huge mound of rice, which was quite possibly the awesomest thing I've ever seen at a Benihana. Way to keep things current. lol...Food was great.  All in all, I was on a first date, and thank goodness he was cute and chill, because the whole experience took all of 3 hours or more.

    "text": "This review is mainly about service.   We've been to this Benihana's quite a few times since they've opened about a year ago or so. We went the other day, and there was only about 3 tables in the main dining room. When we got to the hostess podium, we told  the hostess that we had a reservation for 12:30pm on Tuesday, 1/9/18. We arrived at 12:35pm, and the hostess seemed like she didn't know what to do. She had to ask her co-worker on how to work the GuestBridge system. Maybe she was still new. When she escorted us to the table, she was going to seat us to a table with no settings. I asked her, \"Are you sure this table?\" And she she said \"yes.\" I said, \"There are no settings though.\" Hostess seemed hesitant and then there was a server who was standing nearby, and motioned her to direct us over to the table WITH settings.   We got seated and she gave us the menus and returned back to the hostess podium. Our server name was Sally (or so it says on our check). She seemed friendly but I think needs more training. I came to lunch with my parents and we all ordered 3 hot teas. When she came back, she handed my hot tea with her hands on top of the rim (where your mouth would touch). There IS a handle that's attached to the cup. I don't understand why she didn't use the handle, but to put her hands on top of the cup. Then when our salads came, she handed to us in a woobley motion and said \"Here you go.\" She didn't use a tray (which she should have) but it looked so sloppy. She held all three salads in both hands. Awkward.   Our food came out pretty good. No complaints about the Teppan-Yaki Chef. He just needs to smile.   Sally came over to the table and she asked if it was going to be on one check. We barely got our food and she asked us if it's going to be on one check. Umm ok? Sally did come a couple of times to check if we needed any more hot water, etc.   I understand that it was such a slow day! Only 3 tables total. A party of 3  ladies (behind us) was already done and there was a single lady who was nearly done as well.  There was a couple who came in about 20-25 minutes after us, and sat across from us. I understand it was super slow. Sally was just chilling in the back by the sushi bar guys. The manager doesn't seem to care too much either. He was having some cheddar fries or hot fries (in guests view) and just chilling.  Shouldn't the manager not eat on the floor, anyway? It just looked so unprofessional.   There was a vendor person working on something that needed all the employees's attention. Which I guess is fine.   When we finally were ready to pay, we needed change. The bill was $51, and we gave Sally $100. Sally then says \"I need to find $9 for you.\" She gave us back $40 only. She was supposed to give us $49. Who does that--give you half change back? My dad didn't wanna wait any longer, so he just said to keep the $9. She probably didn't think we were going to tip her good. Oh well that's probably the best tip she was going to get all day anyhow.   I don't usually come here as often as much as I used to. I think the staff needs new training on how to serve drinks and utilize the trays. Managers should definitely send people home if it's super dead. It's called Labor control. Or have the staff fold napkins or do something that doesn't require personal conversations. It just doesn't look professional. Guess they just don't give a shit. Hostess needs to be trained or retrained on table numbers and the GuestBridge system.  I wanted to say something to the manager, but I don't think he would care. He was too busy eating his cheddar fries.",

Mom always said if you do not have anything good to say ...  First update. manager blamed server . Unbelievable   Second update. Made the whole order chicken fried rice. I wanted vegi  Unbelievable part is that the manager threw his staff under the bus. Seems to be re occurring per staff   Staff is great. Manager not so much   End result two + hour service   I'd say I'd never Benihana again",

Chef Hans our cook was spectacular! We ordered off the \"lunch special\" menu I highly recommend the fillet mignon/hibachi shrimp plate kind of smallish portions but it was delicious and will come back again this week! They hooked up moms w a desert ice cream & bday jingle of course along w the pictures souvenir. Overall we enjoyed the experience. Always love me some Benihanas!!!",

    "text": "Had a reservation at 7:45 , we got there at 7:38.. didn't get seated until 8:30 .. the server Christina was okay, she gave attitude when someone in our table asked why it was so hot , she just pointed to the grill and said \"the grill is hot there's nothing we can do \" but I'm assuming it's because we were in a little room and not out in the open like everyone else therefore ventilation SUCKED .. we were sweating , it was extremely hot and humid . My eyes burned from the smoke while chef was cooking.. the chef was young , short dark fella , you can tell he's starting off recently ( we assumed ) but he did a great job . He is the only one that made my experience worth it , he needs a little more practice however he tried his best and he is HILARIOUS ! Front definitely needs to learn how to handle things better . There's no point in making reservations if you aren't going to honor it . Food wise I only liked the shrimp , steamed rice , onion , and zucchini . The scallops were not the best , calamari wasn't either , and only 2 people ( including me ) in our party of 5 enjoyed their food.. safe to say I will not be back .. but I did give the chef 40$ tip because it seemed like he was the only one who cared . Hostess/server didn't really care much for us . Spent over $200 and at the end we all wished we would have gone somewhere else . Waste of money and time .. we left Benihana's at 10:30 .. so we were there from 7:30-10:30.. Yikes .",

    "text": "Asides from the fact that Steve Aioki's dad founded Benihana, this ACTUAL location is pretty cool. It's the new establishment of the Benihana chain, but of course, they added more flair by modernizing it, opening up, and just adding nothing but red on red on red. For some reason, red seems to be the thing. Like if it's super red inside, some spontaneous thing happens that wouldn't expect to happen in an establishment, or that maybe there's a secret door that leads to some secret room that holds the answers to all of our worldly questions.   Anyways! We hit up Benihana's for a friend's birthday, because it's her favorite spot (let's call her Tami). Tami's husband, spoke to the waitress and asked for the funniest guy in the restaurant. You're welcome. I've cracked the ultimate teppanyaki code. Usually, in experiences like these you pray that the chef you get is the funniest person in the establishment. It makes or breaks your experience. The whole thing is like playing roulette, but with your chef. So I've cracked the code. We got the funniest guy in that place. His name is Tony. Tony the tiger (That's right! You heard me!). I believe he's off on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. So if you're there, and you want the funny guy. No need to slip a $5. Just ask for Tony. ;)  He'll make you spongebob. He'll make you a minion. He'll even write your name on the grill with egg whites. You are a charmer ,Tony! Yes. You. Are. I know. Total spoiler alert, but you'll thank me later when you're coordinating your party, and you want to validate that your chef is funny to ensure your party is happy.  You know the usual fixings here if you're a regular, but I would highly recommend getting that housemade diabolo sauce. It is literal fire. Your mouth will be feeling ten different shades of hotness, but it is addicting.   Also, ask for extra garlic butter. Why? Because your are an adventurer! You live life on the edge! No cholesterol, high blood pressure, or food coma is going to stop you from getting exactly what you want!",

    "text": "If I could give Benihana at the Fashion Show Mall negative stars I would... 1 star is far too generous! We arrived at the overly crowded resturant for our reservation at 6p last night (Saturday 6/28), to a less than stellar greeting by the hostess. .. but hey! Its 2019! Our expectations  for an above-average greeting are low. We were taken to our table where we were seated with 3 people who immediately told the manager that they were in a hurry as they were running late for a Paul McCartney concert. Two questions: 1. Who goes to Benihana in a hurry?! 2. Why on earth would the resturant seat them with people who were not only NOT in a hurry but were specifically there to enjoy the 'experience'? The chef was rushing through everything... a small trick here n there but his agenda was definitely to get that food cooked...served and get us the heck out of there... just as he had been told. Side note: We spent the week prior building the anticipation of my young daughter, her friend and my 81 year old mother... explaining that their socks would literally be knocked right off by the fun and excitement had by all at Benihana! Their socks stayed put all night. Our party of 5 was soooooo disappointed by the rushing and lack of enthusiasm that we then called the manager over and asked why the 'Rushers' were being accommodated and not us?! The manager then asked our chef to slow down and give the full experience. Understandably the chef was confused and a tad agitated... he is being told to hurry up and slow down. He was flustered! Again... whhhhhy seat us at the same table?!?! Soup came, salad came, rice came, veggies came... we asked why our shrimp appetizers were skipped? Oh the 'Rushy Rushersons' at the table have a shellfish allergy!!! So once again THEY are being favored... and we got to have shrimp for dessert...yay! Our drink glasses sat empty for extended periods. I finally received a refill of warm ice tea which completely melted my few remaining ice cubes. I asked for a cup of ice which I finally enjoyed with my shrimp dessert. In the midst of the rushing, my mom's main chicken dish was not brought out from the kitchen nor prepared.  The chef explained that he was so caught up in obliging the  'Rushers' that he had forgotten. I gave my mom half of my chicken and told him not to worry about it. The 'Rushers' left without a word. They didn't leave the chef a tip although he spend his time and energy accommodating THEM. This did not make him happy and his disappointment did not go unnoticed... yay for us! The manager took our forgotten chicken off the bill but we were charged for the chicken I halved to feed my mother. I am not a negative Yelper... I've never taken the time to write a complaint letter to a corporate office...  but I am furious that we paid actual money for that ridiculousness last night. If I can discourage anyone from going to Benihana at the Fashion Show Mall I will! Don't go! You can pay 25.00 for a basic chicken breast and rice ANYWHERE!!! (And actually in my case a half of chicken breast). The resturant is loud and food average... the entertainment value is not there! Go next door to Sugar Factory... it looked so fun there!",

After I had eaten my steak, the chef finally served the onions.  Oops, but he forgot the mushrooms.  Too late, my steak was cold  It was a 2 hour painful experience.  To make matters worse when we left, our clothes and hair wreaked from the cooking smoke.  We had to put everything in a blastic bag and send them out to be dry cleaned.  I have been to Benihanas several times, but this location was a disapointment.",

But 15$ is crazy, however I was at a table w a bunch of cheap people who didn't order a single soda or anything. So I figured why not, I tried the pineapple margarita, and it was good. Again... not 15$ good. The cook (Hans) was incredible and very funny. The lunch portions are a good size and a good price but everything else is crazy expensive and the waitress we had this time was not good, I can't even remember her name... it's a tough crowd at Benihana and the girl I was sitting with was giving her a hard because she was pretty unhappy w the service. I felt bad, so I tipped good. But all in all, it's way overpriced for what U get. However, if u are looking for some bomb sushi and happy hour, this is ur spot. Just stay away from the grills. Also get the Las Vegas roll ",

First, I made a reservation for 4 people at 7:15 tonight for my boyfriend's birthday to find out they \"got confused\" and \"gave the reservation to someone with a similar name\". So we had to wait for about 15 minutes for a reservation I made a week in advance. Then, we waited for 20 minutes for them to tell us that the grill we were sitting at was not working. Then, WE WAITED FOR ANOTHER HOUR FOR THE CHEF TO COME. During this wait, we witnessed our waiter be super rude to a different customer and waited 15 minutes for soup. SOUP. We only got the soup because one of the people at our table complained about the wait. They did not offer forks or anything to us for the salad or in general. The food was good and our chef, Heath, was very kind and a great chef, but our waiter checked on us once and it was after the chef was done cooking. We had to track him down for literally anything (or anyone for that matter) and it just was an awful experience. Don't waste your time here. It's overpriced and if you want cheaper, faster, and just as great quality food go to: Hokkaido and Ohjah. Both amazing places with great waiters, great service, great food, and very much worth it.",

This was the best 'risk' we took in Vegas!  The seats are far enough from the griddle that little hands can't reach (if that's something you're nervous about) and our cook was simply amazing!!  If you are able to sit at one of Johnny's tables, DO IT! Not only was the food amazing, but he was fantastic with our kids! He was entertaining, personable, easy to talk to, funny...it was like having lunch with a new best friend who was instantly family. He even did magic tricks for our kids after they were done eating so my husband and I could peacefully finish our meals. I simply can not praise him enough!  And if Johnny's manager is reading this: I don't know what he is being paid, but that man deserves a raise! Hands down the best service and experience we have ever had, anywhere!   Plus the food was delicious! We ordered the sushi appetizer, Hibachi steak, chicken fried rice, soup, filet mignon, lobster tail, shrimp...all were absolutely delicious!  Also, the portions of the kid's menu were great! Our older kids are often still very hungry when they order off the kid's menu, but they had more than enough to eat here! Even our picky eater  We will absolutely be back and will continue to insist our friends and family do the same. All our future trips to Vegas will include at least one meal at Benihana's to see Johnny!",

Items ordered: Chili Shrimp Roll- consisted of crab, cream cheese, tempura shrimp (in buffalo sauce), garnished with jalapenos and cilantro (this item was just okay, would not order again or recommend)  Lunch Duet: Hibachi Shrimp + Chicken Filet + Sea Scallops  Both lunch entrees were fabulous!   Quick dining experience when seated in the bar area. I would return and recommend.",

    "text": "I give this review not against the restaurant itself, but one of their waitresses, Christina. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to dine in due to an asthma attack that was triggered by the stove. Christina was serving me and two of my friends at a table with another party of 3. As soon as I felt that I was ill and needed medical assistance I kindly asked if she could ring me up for my meal and have it plated to go so my friends could bring it to me after. She asked if \"I had to go now\" and I did let her know I was sick and needed to see someone. She handed me the bill, which I paid for in full, and I went to the front of the restaurant and waited to be escorted by mall security to the a place where I could get transported to the nearest hospital. As I was waiting, she came up to me and let me know that \"I left my braid on the table.\" I currently have Senegalese twists and one came loose and fell under the table.  I'm struggling to breathe and this is what she approaches me to say? \"Not I hope you feel better. Sorry you didn't get to dine with us\" nothing. So now I'm extremely annoyed and want to know why she just came up to me in the manner that she did.  It turns out that she was upset that I didn't tip her. I would understand that if she actually served me..she did not. I ordered and paid for a drink I didn't get to touch. She was pressuring my friends to call me and let me know that I didn't tip her which they refused to do. She also went as far as reprinting my receipt and asking one of my friends to forge my signature. I couldn't breathe and all this woman was worried about was a 13 dollar tip. The managers were receptive to my complaint, but I will be calling corporate.   Nothing against Benihanna's once again! They were very attentive and the management made sure I was comfortable while waiting. Just know that Christina feels extremely entitled to her tip. Even if she didn't do anything :)",

It's new, very clean. Only 1 con is we had to wait 35 minutes for the cook to start at the table, that's a lil bit long for a lunch service in an almost empty restaurant ( 3 tables were full)  Brendon was our cook, he was very nice , attentive and funny, entertaining . We enjoyed our lunch there. Prices r lil bit higher then in CA but still ok.  Will be back soon",

One side is pretty basic dining and the other side is  set up with several chefs tables where you will be entertained by the chef and possibly be sitting with complete strangers. It was only the 2 of us, so after we were seated, the  hostess sat two more parties of 2 people. Each table accommodates 8 guests total. The show is fun, chefs are playing with your food while they cook it, and everyone gets to watch. We ordered the steak and chicken and the shrimp and chicken. Both entrees were part of a 5 course dining, including soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, main course white rice, vegetables and hot tea to finish. You have the option to substitute your rice for fried rice, and I highly recommend it! Best fried rice I've ever had!  At the end of our dining all of the servers gathered around and sang happy birthday in Japanese and then in English. They also offered a small dessert too. The prices are extremely reasonable here and the service team really exceeded our expectations. It is a great way to celebrate a birthday or any occasion.",

The manager gave us all appetizer cards to apologize for the inconvenience. Our server was Tia. All she did was take our order and then sit down for our whole entire meal. We also weren't offered any drinks they just brought us water which we had finished and sat empty for most the night. We asked for sake bombs and they brought us shot glass that were too tall that didn't even sit in the cups properly. I wish they would have let us know prior, that they don't have the proper glasses to do sake bombs. They forgot to sing my friend happy birthday. All the servers had a bad stinky stuck up attitude and all 14 of my friends will never be back ever again. The chefs were funny, friendly and entertaining the only saving grace of the whole restaurant. Osaka is much better! With much better service don't waste your time coming here.",

Got seated in the back corner and that's fine. Usually either the server and or chef ask about special occasions. The chef asked a group of ladies and it was one of their birthday. When it came to us it was , where you from ? Start to answer him and he just rudely moves onto the next group. He was also kinda short with them , then going back to the girls. The overall show was meh , didn't care for the fact that food was flying from the grill onto the table. My wife got the Chateaubriand and said she wanted it rare. The guy almost over cooked it. My wife was not happy. Then at the end they ask again about special occasions , only made sure that the girls were celebrating a birthday and the server says well you get a free ice cream , my wife says it should say it's our anniversary. I'll make sure to get a ice cream also. A group of employees sang a \"celebration song\" , gave us our bills and collected them. All the years been going to the one near home , people celebrating an occasion, they always take a photo of you to commentate it. Did that happen ?? NOPE !!! That was the nail in the coffin for us going back again.  I guess my wife and I are spoiled with the level of service we get at the one near home. 2 stars for the food at least tasting good , what we ate of it. We never  take a to go container and my wife I did this time.",

Came with a big party to celebrate mine and my mother's 4 year kidney transplant anniversary :) Beautiful interior and amazing service. They even kept the cake we brought cold in their back fridge! The menu looks to have expanded with plenty of new appetizer options and added sushi rolls. Much smaller than the location at the west gate, but the modern touch and more convenient location makes up for it. There is valet parking very close for the restaurants outside the Fashion Show and you can even text them when you're done with dinner and they'll have your car ready! There's no fancy koi pond or waterfall like the old Benihana's, but it was still a wonderful experience!",

Management had the dog removed from the chair but had to ask them to get the dog off the napkin.   The owner of the dog told them that the dog was not a service animal.  The manager Victor didn't ask them to take the dog outside. When going out for a meal at a reputable company such as Benihana to have a dog sit at the table is poor management.  I have provided a picture of the dog so people can see what it looked like at the restaurant.  Animals should be kept at home if they want to have the pet at the table.   Restaurant staff was not helpful. The waitress said about 5 excuses when I was there.  My request was to not have the dog at my table.  The waitress made the matter worse.  The food was amazing but everything else failed to meet expectations.",

We walked in and were seated immediately, our chef was personable, although a bit quiet. His cooking was on point.  I found the lighter sauce for meats to be of a very thin consistency.  Besides that, it was pretty standard and met my expectations. We had to walk to the bar in order to enjoy happy hour, but that was no problem   This is a solid choice for hibachi on the strip.

While the chef was cooking our food he specifically asked us if we wanted garlic butter on our food and we said no, yet he loaded it up and served it to us.  In all our visit took just under 2 hours.  Half the table got up and left because they were fed up as well.  The chef was still serving people when we asked to speak to the manager and for our bill.  The manager made excuses and could see we were upset but did nothing to assist in the situation.   I regret not getting up and leaving as soon as this debacle started.

    "text": "Food: No other restaurant can compete or compare with Benihana's fried rice with garlic butter. It is the best, and what keeps me going to this restaurant.    Customer Service: Unfortunately, the customer service experience is consistently one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant. I frequent this restaurant often and the customer service is awful. As an example, my cousin specifically informed the server how she wanted the chef to prepare her steak, medium rare. She also mentioned that she didn't want sauce on her sushi rolls if it has a mayo base due to food allergies.   Unfortunately, the server brought her the steak well done that was supposed to be cooked medium rare, and the sushi rolls had mayo sauce that she informed the server ahead of time, not to add it. The server seemed annoyed and had an attitude about it.   Once we received her meal that she ordered 20 minutes later after originally ordering it the first time, I was done with my meal and had to wait for her to eat hers. We also noticed the chef recycled the sushi rolls by scraping off the mayo sauce. We were in shocked that he did that, even though we informed the server twice of her allergies which still could have caused an allergic reaction. We spoke with the Manager about it and she apologized for the inconvenience.   Again, the food is great! However, the customer service is lacking big time!! Please keep in mind that was only one example of many times that I have experienced bad customer service at this specific location.",

Chef also forgot the chicken portion of my meal and forgot the shrimp of another woman's meal. Server did not make us feel welcome, more like we were bothering her for being there. I was also there to celebrate my wife's birthday and usually the server asks if we were there for a special reason, but she did not, so I had to mention it. After our meal, she asks the other lady what kind of ice cream flavor would she like for her bday and didn't ask my wife and I had to again tell her that it was my wife's bday! We love Benihana and always eat there for special occasions, first time trying Benihana's in Vegas... total let down.",

    "text": "So, Benihana has a lot of hype around it. I was in town with a group and this was a wonderful spot for a group.   The service was good, the chef was kinder than the server who worked hard, but wasn't \"friendly\". He was full of all of the details such as the sauces available, the salad dressing, the rice and the order he would be taking orders. It was necessary to pay attention.   We were there for their dinner service. I believe we paid for their name more than anything. I had the filet and scallop dish affectionately called  Land N' Sea. It was $45 which is fine, but the fried rice was an additional $5 which I thought was odd. If you don't make that selection you get the white rice. The meal included soup and salad. It should have included ice cream, but that never came to the table.   My steak was perfect, cooked just as I requested and the scallops were good too. That garlic butter is a winner. There was a hefty serving, plenty for me to take home and have lunch the next day.   I was visiting and there is no Benihana in my city so when I say I wouldn't go back, that's pretty accurate...but mostly because I wouldn't go out of my way for Benihana.",

When we arrived, I confirmed the reservation which they had a problem finding at first but come to find out the hostess was new and just didn't know.. not her fault.. Anyways, we started off at the bar because it was happy hour and well who doesn't want one of the huge Benihana punch bowls at Noon? It's Las Vegas and 5 o'clock somewhere right? The bartender was super sweet and made our drinks perfect.   After grabbing the drinks we headed over to the table where there was only one other family. The chef was cool and did a great job with performing all the tricks and singing. Food was good as well although I felt like I got shorted on the amount of scallops that I normally get but whatever.. Overall I would say it was a good experience!",

And you either love it or it's really just not your thing.   I love a good hibachi grill and I've been to some really high-end ones in Asia. This is not that, but it's good fun and the food is plentiful and tasty. Plus, I'm a sucker for a good onion volcano and some entertainment while dining.   The only thing I don't like is smelling like the food when you leave, but there's nothing much you can do about that. All in all it is a fun way to spend an evening dining with friends. I always find Benihana is better with a large group.",

Literally LOVE my food when he cooks it. There's no need for me to add sauce to my rice or any season to my food. It's PERFECTION!! Service is usually great too but when I came in recently I had to ask my server for spicy teriyaki 3 times and still didn't get it. I also wasn't satisfied with my food because the regular cook wasn't there. (Not to say the food was terrible). Also, the salads are tasty but I don't like how it comes in a cold bowl with dressing on top and you can obviously see that it was pre made sitting in the fridge, it's not appealing. I hold Benihana to a higher standard than that.  When I went into the bathroom a host was just starting her shift and was getting changed in the big stall. I don't think she used the restroom BUT she didn't wash her hands and it didn't sit right with me at all. Once you touch anything in the bathroom especially a public one, you must wash your hands -Whether you're a server or not.",

Paying $150 for a dinner for 2 should at least come with a smile from your server. Fake it if you have to, but don't bring us down just because you don't like your job. Didn't need it, but weren't offered the hot green tea or the ice cream at the end. Probably would have declined it, but at least give me the option since I'm paying for it. Also, zero ventilation in this place. Hole in the wall Korean bbq places in LA do a better job controlling the smoke. We couldn't leave fast enough.

We had a few incidents when server and chef dropped a teacup and a glass of water , but other than that. I loved it !   I started off with shrimp tempura, Had the colossal shrimp and filet mignon. Everything was Delish and I wasn't skimped on the food portion ! I was very full at the end.   We also tried  the fish punch bowl drink. Very Delish .  Will definitely come back to try out the rest of the menu .   They also sang happy birthday to me . So awesome. I was totally embarrassed. Lol .   I definitely recommend this place ! Such a fun time . Such great food and service !",

We were fortunate enough to reserve a private room that really made the experience much more intimate and special. Our server and hibachi cook were really on-point with service, being attentive making sure drinks were refilled and plates cleared out of the way as well as our hibachi chef's showmanship--always love the onion fire volcano. Not only were we entertained with the  food preparation but it was also delicious. My Hubby ordered potstickers while I enjoyed the Chili Ponzue YellowTail appetizer. Thereafter we were served soup & salad prior to our main entrees: steak & chicken for my Hubby and lobster, scallops and shrimp (Ocean Treasure) for me along with chicken fried rice. The food was excellent!!   Our server, who had a wonderful bubbly personality, also took our picture to commemorate the evening.   Although we had a great time experiencing the hibachi grill service, after looking at their extensive menu we'll certainly be venturing back to try out their other menu items like the Seafood Diablo.",

I ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir and the server brought out an ice bucket and put it on ice, which confused me, I thought perhaps their wine was a little warm so that's why, until the server came back and said the bartender informed him that you're not supposed to ice red wine...duh?  Then I ordered the Benihana Delight (chicken and shrimp) for my gf and the server asked how I would like it cooked...lol what?    Our chef came out and started preparing our food with so many slip ups and mistakes that it was hard to ignore. I've had a hibachi chef before who was barely 18 and he made less mistakes. As I looked around the room I noticed the other chefs were much more skilled so clearly we just got the short end of the stick.     The food was definitely the saving grace, everything was delicious, from the chicken fried rice to the scallops. However, my filet mignon was a little undercooked and bland.     I definitely wish we would've gone to the Westgate location instead, it's much nicer and bigger, with a more seasoned staff.",

We arrived on time and still had to wait for awhile which was ok with us. Tried to order a mai tai from bar but bartender was too busy making drinks for servers. Why not have a 2nd bartender management?? After waiting 15 minutes for service a manager helped me and made the worst tasting drink that was NOT a mai tai as he stated!! We finally got seated and one of my guest had to leave, she was not feeling well. We all were seated when some single female stranger came to sit with our group which was awkward. I had to tell her it was kind of weird for her to join our private group when she had other options to sit at other tables with smaller groups. The male manager told me that was too bad she was told to sit with us, I told him it was awkward and felt like walking out with our group but we were all hungry. The lady moved to another table after that. Manager was young and very rude and unprofessional. Place was pretty new and the service reflected that. We had a female cook and an African American male cook which was a first for me at any Benihana. No complaints just thought that was cool! We could tell they were both brand new in training because their skills were bad and service was slow and totally unorganized. We dealt with it and stuck to beers as all the mix drinks were messed up. Because this place was new I am willing to try it out again. We usually go to the other Benihana at Westgate in Las Vegas where they are old school and very much more professional.",

We had a relatively inexperienced chef cooking for us, and even though the food turned out O.K., for the price it was disappointing. She managed to drop a lobster on the floor before cooking it, so had to ask someone to bring her another one. You really pay for the show here, and even though our chef was smiling and cheerful, she didn't quite have the knife work and \"flash\" down pat to perform as well as a few of the other chefs at surrounding tables. They recognized our special occasion, and tried really hard, but unless you have never been to this type of restaurant before, save some money and have either a good Japanese, Chinese or Thai meal elsewhere, where it is all about the food, and not dependent on the skills, experience, or temperament of your chef to make your experience special (or not).",

At times I had to move my chair for them to get by.The two chefs, the one at our table an the table next to us, were pretty much butt to butt. They need to expand the place a bit if possible. The food was not bad. I have a gripe about them giving us rice in the beginning and then it getting very cold by the time everything is cooked. It's not just this Benihana's, but I noticed they do this at other teppenyaki places. Why can't they just wait until everything is cooked and then just bring the rice? Rice cools off so fast, and white rice is just not enjoyable to eat by itself. Anwyay, it wasn't bad and our server was nice. The meat was tender, and the chef at our table told us how to cook it so it's tender. I tried it at home, but, of course, I couldn't do this at home, and my meat still came out kind of dry.",

Only problem...we have been waiting for almost 2 hours for our checks. We had a group of 8 people (including myself) celebrating a birthday party. Everything was going extremely well until it was time to pay. We were told we had free drinks due to a coupon and we were charged. They said they would take care of it and we sat for another 20 minutes. Then the checks were still messed up and again we are now still waiting. Been here since 6:30pm and planned to be done by or before 9pm due to the food coming out quickly. So we can move on to our next event planned. Now we are all frustrated and ready to go. Oh and they forgot to sing happy birthday to the birthday girl.  Overall server (Alex) and Chef (Hans) thanks for the great meal and service!",

    "text": "First off, this is not my first visit to your establishment. I've visit many in California and have had a memorable experience.  I visited the Las Vegas venue on Saturday nigt 3/23. What an awful and disappointing experience.  Started with a lost 9pm reservation for 6 hungry and tired visitors.   At 830pm i Called to verify our time slot and of course....reservations  not on the books.  Hostess was able to put is on for 915.  Arrived at 905 but the didn't seat us till 25 min later.  By the time the whole table was greeted by our waitress Danielle it was 10pm.    We politely asked her if we can place our whole order due to it being late and we knew thats why people come to visit to enjoy a cooking show and your food. Danielle denied us and told us she was to order drinks and appetizer only.   Ok....  After our long wait of nothing i decided to politely go over to the hostess to request the manager Ruby was the person i spoke with.   But during my conversation with Ruby Danielle noticed that i was having a conversation and right away took offense of my actions and was rude and condescending to me. Roughly Placing my soup and salad as if she was upset.  Never once did Danielle ever say that the kitchen was having issue or why it was taking an hour to get our first course.  Not sure you want  these type of people  representing  your establishment. Miguel the chef provided a ok show. He could see that the whole table was upset.  He did his best.  Not sure if i will return to the one in LV or to recommend your establishment to my friends.   My husband had words with the 2nd manager Josh who is definitely not a person who needs to be part of your establishment. Rude and not respectful to customers that are visiting your establishment.  Hopefully you'll address this issue  soon.  I enjoy Benihana food and the cooking experience.",

We came for lunch on a Friday, for the $16 Lunch duo. Your choice of two items, which comes with soup and vegetable fried rice. I totally recommend the yakisoba and calamari!  On a Friday @ 12 pm it was very slow so we had the whole table for our party of four. Very clean and modern located in Fashion Show mall on the strip side, easy access to the restaurant. The closest parking is at Fashion Show, right underneath the mall.    This place is great for a cheaper lunch meal on the strip, great choices and food with a show.",

    "text": "The best thing about the experience was the food. Everything else fell far short of our expectations. We made a reservation for 4 at 9:00pm to celebrate my spouse's birthday. We were finally seated 20 minutes after 9. The server came over and took our drink orders, and they were served fairly promptly. Then things started going downhill very quickly. To say the service was slow would be the understatement of the century. The table behind us was seated 10 minutes after we were, but their order was taken before ours and they were already finished eating by the time we put one bite of food in our mouths. We didn't even have a chef to cook our meal until 10:30pm (again, for a 9:00pm reservation). The server and manager had no explanation as to why it took so long for us to be served while the other table was taken care of so quickly. With the cook not getting to our table until an hour and a half after our reservation time, you would think the wait staff and management would be constantly checking in on our group, making sure we have full glasses or a free round of drinks. You would be wrong. When he finally did arrive, the cook's presentation of the food was so-so at best. The first trick he performed was dropping an egg on the floor. Luckily the food itself was tasty. Management did give us a discount for the inconvenience, but the whole experience left us with a bad taste in our mouths. Pun intended.   By the time we left, the restaurant was empty. My spouse went to the bathroom as we were leaving. When he came out a minute later, management had locked the doors. He had to unlock the door to let himself out of the store because there was no employee there to do so.   Next time, we will go to the Westgate location. We have always had great service there.",

Absolutely insane that you can go in and spend an average of $120 for 2 people without alcohol, and they choose to be stingy about that!? We love coming here either way, the girls up front are never welcoming, BUT the rest of the staff is amazing! I would consider new hostesses from a management standpoint, they're THAT rude at times. Never welcoming, and actually scoffed in my face and told me they can't know how long guests will stay after eating when I let them know my reservation was 40 minutes prior and we were still waiting(And for my husbands surprise bday party too): ..but seriously don't let the ladies be the reason you don't stay! We come here as often as possible, for every reason we can! Expect to spend $30-50 per person and spend about 1.5 hours here for the hibachi seating. All the food is great, and they are very accommodating to our twin toddlers.",

    "text": "So we sat at Table 5 and our chef was Aaron , our server was Jasmine ticket #40023. So everything started out well, we received our table in the time we reserved. Our server started us out with water as we placed our drinks/sushi/and food orders. Our sushi came late, like after our soup. And only one of the two rolls came. We had to inquire about the 2nd roll. The second roll came after our chef had began serving the rice and stuff. (We rejected the second roll, it was already time to eat the main meal). There were times we had to ask for our waitress to find out where our regular steam rice was, or for refills, or for another fork. Seemed once the chef came it was a total disregard for the table.   So as we were talking about our service and another table enlightened us to the fact that the chefs don't get none of the tips at the end of the night that you give to the server. You have to tip the chef independently in order for them to receive any tips. In my opinion I think that's total crap, the chefs are the personalities that everybody gets to meet in deal with not the server. That policy should be reversed where all tips go to the chef, if you want to tip the waitress then do so.  Aaron was a great chef and a good personality! We def be back to see HIM",

It wasn't my first choice but when I found out they were doing Happy Hour I was happy to oblige! They HH menu is good from 12-6pm Mon - Sat and they also have a special lunch menu. The prices are reasonable . I ordered seaweed salad, a couple of rolls and a side of the hibachi vegetable rice. In True Cecille fashion, I ordered way too much food. But everything I did have was delicious! The rice alone I could eat but in a larger size!  Service was a little delayed as the bartender seemed to be spread way too thin so her manager had to step in to help. I would definitely eat here again.!

This location has only been open for about 5months, it's a little smaller than what I am familiar with but that's ok, I still enjoy the show around the grill. It's always an amazing place to meet new people. Everyone had a glass of hot green tea, onion soup with mushrooms and little onion as well is a fresh salad with ginger dressing.   My main course, I had grilled shrimp, with fried chicken rice full of garlic butter and when I say full I mean hoooooked up with garlic butter, I also enjoyed teriyaki chicken with a plate full of vegetables. So much food, well seasoned and flavorful, I love Benihana and enjoy the show with every meal. Since it was my birthday, they sang happy birthday and gave me a ice cream Sunday (green tea flavor). I recommend that you join the Benihana's club as I did you will get a meal voucher on your birthday for $30 off you meal. So in the end my meal only came out to $3.00   Great place to take your family for a dinner.",

Me and 9 other friends met for dinner and expected the service to be amazing seeing as though we were going to be drinking and eating a lot. Instead we had a rude chef at our table who was visibly frustrated with the orders and how many of us there were. He would ignore us when we would speak to him or try to clarify anything. With such a large group things can get miscommunicated easily between the guest and the server and the chef. Instead of acting professionally and being nice about it he was stand-offish and rude. As a group of black people we definitely felt the stereotype from our server and the management. We purchased a multitude of shots of Don Julio 1942 from the bar because the server was taking extremely long with our drink orders. We still purchased regular drinks as well through the server. By the time we all finished paying we were then chased down by the manager Abby with a reprinted check saying we didn't pay. Of course when I walked in the check with the money in it was sitting clear as day on the table by my plate. Instead of checking the table they assumed we didn't pay and tried to humiliate us in front of the entire restaurant (btw that had 0 other black people there)",

I don't eat shrimp so asked for a substitute of vegetables. Nope, sorry can't do it.  Seriously? You just mixed vegetables into everyone else's dishes right in front of me but you can't mix up just vegetables for me? The chef took forever, my food literally was done 30 mins before my husband's way overdone steak. And the worst part was that we came out reeking from the chef using way, way, way too much oil and garlic. We had to bail on our night out and toss our clothes in a plastic bag it was so bad.

I haven't been to a Benihana restaurant in years, so I was pretty excited. We had a reservation and got seated pretty fast. Our server was really nice, but a little slow to bring out our drinks (there was not many people in the restaurant at the time), but we didn't really mind. The food was just how I remembered it, SO GOOD! I ordered the shrimp, and it was delicious. Our chef (sadly I forgot his name) was so cool and very efficient! They brought my friend out ice cream for her birthday, but the waiter took awhile to get workers over to sing for her (which was a little odd), by the time they came her ice cream was already half eaten so it didn't melt. The manager came over after the meal and asked how everything was, she was very nice and sincere! Other than a few minor things, was overall a good experience!",

HALF THE PRICE GUYS! Whoop  Kyle our grill chef was great, super funny! Ask for him to be your chef if he's in! The atmosphere was a little quite but it was lunch time. We did get to sit with two other couples and they were great too! The food. Spot on.   My scallops were grilled nicely. super soft and I had enough to share with my mom and brother. We all ordered the chicken fried rice which was $1 extra which isn't bad. The alternative is veggie fried rice.  Mom and brother got the hibachi chicken. It was a little dry for my, but I'm not much of a grilled chicken girl either. My mom and my brother enjoyed it very much.  My salad was good, nothing special. Just iceberg lettuce and some carrots. The dressing was your usual ginger miso.  Soup, i would go with that next time. It had an amazing mushroom broth with just a slice or mushroom and tempura onions! It was delish. Def an UMAMI dish   Looking forward to going to eat here for my sister in laws birthday this week! Gonna try the steak next time!",

    "text": "Ok so I have to say that I was really let down my my experience at Benihana.  I had a reservation for 12 people for 6:30pm. We get to the restaurant and are seated. Mind you, I called the day before and made a reservation for 12 people, my guest amount never changed, They sit us in 2 tables of 8. Prior to even choosing Benihana as the restaurant to celebrate my niece's birthday I did my research to make sure that they would be able to accommodate such a large party. On the Benihana page it says that they have 12 seater hibachi tables so the fact that after calling and making a reservation for 12 the day prior they sat us in 2 tables of 8 was ridiculous. I honestly didn't feel like I celebrated my niece's birthday with her because I was seated at a different table. If they didn't have a table to accommodate such a large group they should of told me when I made the reservation. And  No, I wasn't told prior that this would be the situation. We get to the table and I tell her, \"there's some chairs missing.\" And the hostess then said we would be sitting that these two tables.  Usually I would of addressed the situation but I was with my elderly grandmother and hungry children plus we had plans after so I didn't want them to have to wait for us to be accommodated like we were a last minute walk up. So I just bit the bullet on it.   Once we were seated it took and hour and a half for our cook to come out!! And once he came out he had to go back to the kitchen because he didn't have our full order. The cook was great! He did the best he could for the situation. I have no complaints there.   However,    I was disappointed at the fact that his is my first time to Benihana and I didn't enjoy the full dining experience. Since we were separated into 2 tables, the cook only \"preformed\" at the other table and my sister,nephew,myself and my son were stuck looking at his back the hole time. This could of been avoided if were were sitting at a 12 seater table.   Also, ventilation was horrible. I had to take my nephew's and children outside every once in while because either their eyes were burning or they couldn't breathe.   So I am sad to say that I would not be going back to Benihana.",

We sat right by the kitchen area and the waitress kept on having me scoot my chair in so she can fit. I was already about an inch away from the grill just so she can fit.  It sucked as this was interrupting conversations.  They need to move the table so there's enough space especially with the waitress being a bit wide.  Outside of that it would've been ok if you didn't end up smelling like a grease pit afterwards.  We went to a show after dinner and as embarrassing it is to say, we wreaked.  Somehow the smell of old grease was stuck on our hair, clothes including undies.  No exaggeration. It was bad and I have no clue why or how we got impregnated with the aroma from there.  If anyone is reading this and wanna know how to get rid of the smell, here's what we did.  Take a long hot shower.  As far as the clothes, we had to google 'Benihana' and 'smell' and discovered that this isn't uncommon. I'm yet to buy OxiClean to soak our clothes for 4 hours. This is supposedly going to get rid of the smell and it won't resurface.  Now our expectations have been set that if we wanna enjoy Hibachi and decide to go to Benihana that we request for a table that's not by the kitchen and we go in a group of 8 or 9 so we get the table to ourselves.  It should also be timed when it's the only place we're going to or the last place before going home so people we come across or near don't give us stink eye or pinched nose as we walk pass due to the grease pit smell.  We can also prepare for a hot, long shower when we get home and undress in the garage and soak clothes in a bucket of OxiClean.  Otherwise clothes go in the backyard bon fire  and yes, including undies.",

    "text": "My mom took me here today for lunch and we had an awful waitress. The whole experience though was just negative. First off, people were not waiting to be seated and were just taking tables, so we had to wait a bit longer. No big deal. A hostess then tells us which table to sit at and points us to it. My mom and I sit down and order two sushi rolls, two spicy chicken fried rice, and asked for two yum yum sauces. We should of been in and out within 20-30 mins but nope, we were there for over an hour. Our waitress brought us empty soy sauce, then didnt bring us yum yum sauce as we were eating one sushi roll so it ruined our experience since we wanted it for the sushi. Then after 15 minutes of asking for another soy sauce and yum yum sauce we finally get the soy sauce but only one yum yum when we needed two, but now where is our rice and other roll? The place wasn't even busy and we felt ignored. We get our rice, finally another sauce, eat it, but still waiting for the second sushi roll. This is now over 45 minutes of ordering. Our waitress also did not bring us plates or silverware and we had to ask someone else for it. As we were also waiting for the last roll to come she took one of our plates away for no reason. We need that to eat clearly so again we had to ask someone else. We talked to a manager who was great and super kind. He gave us 50% off our bill and we appreciated that a lot, but then our waitreas comes over and tries to argue with us about our order, and accused us of not waiting for a table when we did wait. She was trying to fight with us, so we told her we were done with her and went back to find a manager again. Her communication skills were awful and she does not know how to treat guests or work in a restaurant environment. I won't go back to this location because of her. The food tasted good but she is a horrible server and she is representing a brand. I do not want to eat somewhere with employees like her because she stressed me out. It should also not take as long as it did to get food.",

They sat 15 of us at a 12 person table. They didn't start cooking our food until 10:30.... our service was horrible... mind you we all ordered alcohol and the 6 course meal and we're spending money. I was extremely disappointed until our hibachi cook \"too much Tony\" showed up as well as Miguel. They were amazing, hilarious, and lit up our night. They were all worth the wait and i was happy again. Until our check came out, i had not been sung happy birthday after i watched numerous tables receive that... ON TOP OF THAT.... nobody received their tea OR their fricken dessert!!!! In which we all paid for. So respectfully at the end, i asked to speak to the new GM, and explained to him in the utmost respect my experience.... and how we were left out our dessert and tea we paid for and he did not care, did not apologize, or did not accommodate for. HAHAHAHA thanks for the birthday wishes benihana lol... once again ur chefs were absolutely amazing... but your GM and staff was absolutely horrible. Will not be returning. Two stars was for the homie cooks tony and Miguel.",

What you pay for at Hibachi restaurants is the food and show that goes along with it. Our chef was a Spanish speaker and that's not a problem with me, but he did not engage with anyone at the table except for the other Spanish speakers at the table. He barely did a show too... he slipped the cooking utensils at the beginning and at the end he did the onion volcano but that was it... pretty pathetic show if you ask me and the fact that he paid absolutely no attention to my boyfriend and I and the other family across from us is why I am giving it 2 stars. He blatantly ignored us and spoke in Spanish to the Spanish speakers the entire time.",

I loved my salmon with brown rice and vegetables. She used the traditional chopsticks. I used the American version of the chopsticks(fork). The chef prepared the meal with flair and skill. He also did several magic tricks which were fun, fun, fun! The location was convenient to the Las Vegas Strip directly across from the Wynn and Treasure Island.

First of all it is very cramped. It must have been at least 90 degrees inside the restaurant. Service was extremely slow. We waited an hour before we had a chef come to our table. I ended up not eating my main course (lobster) it was horrible  over cooked and no flavor. We will definitely be sticking to the other Benihana at westgate. Much better service and food.",

    "text": "The highest quality steak and seafood combined with sushi near Wynn casino and Treasure Island with outdoor seating next to the fashion show shopping mall, how can you get better dining than that on the Strip along Las Vegas Boulevard? As soon as the doors opened, tourists visiting Las Vegas for the NFR 2016 began pouring in after shopping inside the Fashion Mall. The tables were filled around the grills before noon after they only opened at 11 am. The chef and waitresses were friendly, personable, extremely helpful at explaining the menu, which had excellent prices, especially for lunch. The prices were so good that they surprised me, because the interior is fancy, sitting across from the Wynn Casino that you can see looking out the window, my expectations were for a high price menu, but the prices were excellent, and they had a children's menu for my boy: Appetizers, soups, salad, chicken fried rice, and combinations with steak and seafood: Lobster, scallops, shrimp, the chef put on an amazing show with an onion volcano flaming on fire, green onions with various sauces decorating beef steak, calamari; We watched the tables around us as their dishes were prepared with lobster. Plus the menu promoted a sushi boat. Ginger mushroom soup was served. The highlight for visitors is the location with views, especially if you want to stay on the Strip and not leave Las Vegas Boulevard. Enjoy Benihana as your children visit Santa Claus next to the Apple Store inside. Coffee lovers will be pleased, because there is a Starbucks Coffee right next door so you can continue your trip walking down the Las Vegas Strip. Special thanks to the waitress who was so kind, incredibly helpful and very enthusiastic to make sure all the guests had a great time. The guests around us were all visiting for a medical convention and the National Finals Rodeo at the Thomas and Mack Center. Many had tourists questions about Las Vegas. The waitress and chef at Benihana took the time to answer all the tourists' questions. She was wonderful to the customers, especially those who were having a first time experience with the lunch that arrives with a show, a Las Vegas type show inside a quality Japanese restaurant in the Entertainment Capital of the World.",

The server came not to long after we sat. She smiled, tell us her name, welcomed us and give us some recommendations for drinks. Her name is vinni. The drinks come pretty fast. We order some food after. I ordered fillet with shrimp. One of my buddies got 12 oz steak and the other one order shrimp and scallop. Vinnie told us that they dont have combination shrimp and scallop only. It has calamari too. But she said she can replace the calamari with extra shrimp instead if it OK with us. The price will be cheaper than a la carte. Will do then. We also order 1 appetizer that she recommended  it's crispy tuna. Very delicious!! Don't missed the fried rice. It's so good!   We got our soup and salad, finish with our 2 rounds drinks also finish our appetizers. Where is the chef? Vinnie told us that the chef will be out soon but he didn't come. She knew that we were waiting. She offered us to order another drink while waiting and we did. Thanks to her that she didn't leave and let us wait with nothing. Excellent service!! A+  Here is the chef finally here. His name is tony. Friendly and nice guy. He started the shows and talked. We waited and waited for the food to be to be done. We were so hungry. Both of my buddies couldnt wait, they went outside and come back 30 minutes later and the food still not ready. Wow!! I wonder how long this dinner will be? He forgot couple things, not professional! Over all,we've waited for more than 1.5 hours to get all our food done to cooked.  The food taste good but the timing is awful. The chef just need to stop talking and cook faster. We had to leave before he finished clean the grill.  Come back? Maybe if I have plenty of time to eat because it will take at least 2 hours for the dinner.",

    "text": "My family and I had a reservation at this establishment this evening at 7:30. We arrived on time, but our other members of our party where 5 minutes behind us. They told us once our entire party was there our table was ready for us. Well when the others arrived 5 minutes later we were still waiting for another 30 minutes to be seated. Once we were walked to our table it was not big enough for our party. We had a party of 8 adults and 2 kids, but they tried to put us into a spot for 8 adults. They told us we had to wait another 30 minutes to wait for a bigger table. So at 8:40 we were seated at a bigger table, but they forgot a seat for 1 more adult that was in the restroom, so we still had to squeeze in. We decide to sit anyways as it was already an hour past our reservation.  Once we were seated, they took our order and we were waiting again. An employee from the front desk asked if we were ok which my mom replied \"No, we have been here 2 hours and have not been served, can I see your manager?\" Well guess who never came to see us??? The chef finally got to our table at almost 10, he was very friendly, but he over cooked the shrimp appetizer, over cooked 2 filet steaks, and 2 chicken dishes. I was like \"Are you kidding me?\"  We were never offered an apology for the crappy service that we received. They only comped our side order of shrimp (which is $8). Our bill was over $300, again \"Are you kidding me?\" We will be contacting corporate, as our chef proudly said they were a corporate Benihana's...I suggest to anyone reading this post that if you want to go to Benihana's in Las Vegas, NV, go to Westgate Hotel. They have a Benihana's there that is so much better then here!!!!",

    "text": "Benihana has fallen hard from the iconic Japanese eatery my family had loved. The new location had poor service, chef that got all the orders wrong, could only make 1 meal at a time as the others over cooked and overall ruined my family birthday celebration. I'll never return",
