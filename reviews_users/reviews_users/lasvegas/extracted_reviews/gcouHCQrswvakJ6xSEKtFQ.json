Good, not great, a little salty, & I thought the portion would be a little bigger.",

Clearly who ever opened this location knew what they're doing. It was extremely busy, and yet you didn't feel it with the service. Full staff working, super friendly, quick, professional and one of the best services I got at a fast food chain.   Great experience overall! the food was yummy, but I didn't have enough to determine is it was amazing!   Overall I love the experience!! Trust me, I know food!",

    "text": "Still absolutely in love with Chick-Fil-A and this location is no exception to the wonderful service you're used to. From fast friendly service, to a high quality of food (not typical of fast food places) this place always delivers.   First off, being one of only three locations in Vegas it is ALWAYS busy. I repeat, ALWAYS busy. Now that we've gotten this out of the way, I can assure you that even if it is busy. You will receive your food in a timely fashion (with little to no errors, I myself have yet to experience any issues with any of my orders and this is not my first time at this location). So keep cool - you don't need to worry about long lines or not being able to devour some delicious chicken quickly.   Now as far as what to eat goes, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My personal favorites are the grilled chicken sandwich (not the club!) and the spicy chicken sandwich (comes with cheese, so good). And, you MUST, and I mean MUST top them both with some delectable Chick-Fil-A sauce. This is the best way to enjoy either of these menu items. With this lovely meal, you also need to ensure you order their fresh squeezed lemonade. It is the perfect balance of tart and sweet that is truly thirst quenching.",

The chicken biscuit is simply that - chicken on a biscuit.  Trying to force that dry mess down was a chore.  The coffee was par for the course, but there are plentiful fast food restaurants with far better coffee.  The quality of the food is abysmal.  Service was excellent both visits, even compared to many sit-down restaurants.  More power to the lovers, but I hate this place.",

As such it's just like most of the 2100 other locations in that a spicy deluxe chicken sandwich from this location is just the same as one in Amarillo, TX or Salt Lake City.   Service is what I judge a CFA location on and this location does a great job at handling high volume drive-thru traffic. Wait times are short here in my experience. Also while other CFA locations in Vegas like the one on Stephanie in Henderson have serious problems with order accuracy this is one location that has not messed up my order. Not once.   It can be a pain to get in and out of as it's located close to one of Vegas's most notorious intersections at I-15 and Sahara. But if you're craving some CFA, you can't go wrong stopping here. You'll get in and out fast, and at least in my experience you'll get friendly service without having to worry about your order getting messed up.",

What it is is an ok  place for a chicken sandwich or fingers and not much else. If someone in your party wants a burger or something, go elsewhere. The service is quite fast, considering the lines ( again, WHY?), and the quality is ok if the selection is quite limited. For this, and the cleanliness, which might be attributed to its newness, I'll give 3 stars instead of two. But it's really just ok, and I fear that too many Yelpers have drunk the kool aid.

They went out of their way to make sure the order was correct, made sure I received everything and that I had a way to carry it all. They even went to the back to hunt down a box for me to carry the 15 drinks I had!! There was a line of 30 people behind me but they didn't make me feel rushed or that I was inconveniencing them like other fast food establishments make you feel. They made me feel as if I was the only customer in line and gave me their 100 percent focus!

    "text": "I went into this location expecting that it would be like all of the other Chic-fil-A's I'd been through. Boy, was I wrong. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Club sandwich meal which comes with waffle fries and a soft drink or tea. I ordered the diet lemonade as my drink. The order comes and it's in a paper bag. I tell the person who brought the meal that the food was to eat there, not to go. I'm told that this location, unlike all of the others, serves everything to go (not served on a tray). So I'm supposed to eat off of the table with no tray? I turns out that there are plastic place mats but you have to ask for them. They are kept out of view. Why can't the employees just give you one to begin with? Back to the food. What I got was an ice cold sandwich and soggy fries. After much prodding the sandwich was replaced. I wanted ketchup. Guess what? They hide in a drawer out of the customer's sight. Why? I finish my meal and am about to leave when I happen to look at my receipt. I find out that I have been charged extra for the diet lemonade. I go to the counter and ask to speak to someone about this. Over comes Jim who is supposed to be the manager. I point out that the menu sign says that a drink is included with the meal. He tells me that lemonade is not considered a soft drink. Once again, WHAT? So, I say \"Why doesn't the menu board say that there is an extra charge for lemonade or why doesn't the person taking the orders let you know that?\" His reply is: \"You should have known that it was extra\". When did I become a mind reader? Somebody needs to tell the guests that there is an extra charge for certain beverages OR make sure that it is clearly written on the menu sign. This was my first visit to this location and my last visit too. Chick-fil-A corporate office, you need to have a look at this location. It does not meet the standards that the guests expect.",

    "text": "It breaks my heart to leave this review. I am an avid supporter of Chick-fil-A and have really never had a bad experience. Granted I haven't had amazing experiences every time I've gone to a chick fil a but most are above average. This one wasn't on point. Food was good so I gave them three stars. Knocked two off because their customer service wasn't up to snuff. We wait in line about 5 minutes upon arriving and when we get to register we order. They had a delicious sounding watermelon mint lemonade advertised and I asked if it was extra to get that versus a standard lemonade. The kid at the register said no. We didn't wait long to get our order and sat down. I looked through the receipt and sure enough there was an extra charge for this lemonade (size small btw). Well, I decided it was an honest mistake so don't worry about it....just eat it off. It's hard to think bad thoughts when stuffing your face with delicious crack nuggets! That lemonade was so good! So good I ran out and went to get a refill. GUESS WHAT!!!? They wouldn't refill it with watermelon mint lemonade!! Yeah, you heard me. The team lead that tried to explain to me that I can get free refills, just not for the watermelon mint flavor. I was perplexed and asked for plain lemonade which was \"ok\" to have refills on. I sat down and enjoyed my ice cream and again ran out of drink. I knew I wasn't \"able\" to get more lemonade with watermelon flavor but I still didn't understand why I couldn't when there was not one single place on the menu or advertisement that stated free refills were prohibited. I also noticed the big wig manager dealing with a lady that clearly perturbed about something. I overheard him saying that e could give her anything she liked to make \"it\" right. I said to myself, I guess I'm not the only one having issues today and attempted to talk to the original team lead about why I couldn't have watermelon mint lemonade? Same answer and was dismissed basically. In hindsight I should've talked to the big wig to get some answers but it looked like he was having a bad day already. Perhaps I have a high standard or this experience seems petty but being a former chick fil a employee in the heart of Georgia I know the service and customer satisfaction goals of chick fil a and these guys don't have it. They just opened about a month or two ago so I recognize most of the kids are new (and we aren't in the hospitable south either) but my concerns and questions as a customer matter and when I pay extra money for something and am told I can't have a free refill when it is not specifically stated that I cannot then I'm not gonna be satisfied. What makes matters worse is that I drive almost 30 minutes to eat here! I invest my time and money in a place I love but if I get treated like a dollar sign instead of a person I will just go to another establishment. I pray the chick fil a opening in north Vegas is on point! Good food, mediocre service, annoyingly horrendous parking lot situation, people smoking outside at the tables (in front of the employees) landed this visit at a weaksauce 3 star review.",

The restaurant was doing a brisk dinner business at 6 PM Most of the tables were occupied The order line was non existent and our order was placed immediately and delivered to the table fairly fast. The counter staff was helpful and friendly.  We ordered a  Chick-fil-A  and spicy Chick-fil-A  deluxe sandwiches and an order of waffle fries.   The sandwich breading was a perfect coating and the chicken very moist. The spicy sandwich comes with a slice a pepper jack cheese which adds some heat. Both sandwiches come with tomato, lettuce and pickles and makes for a tasty chicken sandwich. The fries were hot and not greasy or oily. Nice crunchy fries. I tried the Chick-fil-A sauce and I prefer the sandwich without the sauce. It had a slight smokey taste.",

My first visit I was amazed with the professionalism and sense of urgency in which they operated. During my done in experience Patty was amazing, I could see how she would walk around helping all the guest, I'm pretty sure she made a lot of peoples day. On my second visit I met Vicki she was awesome and very kind and reminded me of how awesome my first visit was. Upon leaving I was looking to see if there was a way to leave them a survey but didn't see anything on the receipt. So I decided to leave a yelp review. Hands down they have the best customer service, I've never received this kind of awesome service from any fast food establishment. Keep it up guys with your amazing service!",

    "text": "Finally the grand opening for the Sahara/15 location that is opened to the public. Noticeably more news media coverage at this location compared to the opening of the Chick-fil-A on Eastern. But the parking situation and even the line during the noon hour is very customer friendly (police presence just like the other grand openings, probably every employee is scheduled to work at least part of the day and the line was almost non-existent.  Had I not accidentally left my form of payment in the car, I would have spent under 4 minutes from the time I walked up to the end of the line and getting my order after paying for it. But you know, add the extra two minutes for the extra round trip to the car.  Also they are selling limited edition T-shirts commemorating this event for $15, which I passed up on. Last time I scored a few Chick-fil-A swag, but today they seem to be more tight fisted about it (if there are even any free swag to be passed out). Also menu is recycled/reused for future customers, which is good for the environment and their printing budget for color menu.  Overall, a very nice experience. Also trying their Nuggets for the first time, which is good and lived up to the hype.  Still not a fan of the traffic getting here (off ramp off of a very busy section of the freeway) or the way the parking lot is designed (not their fault).  Anyway, love the quick efficient service and the still brand spanking new look of this very newest Chick-fil-A, and their Nuggets. There's also a possibility that you might be interviewed by one of the local news reporters about this grand opening.  That Asian news reporter is pretty cute and the one in the van applying her makeup for News3 is also an eye candy (even without the full makeup effect).   Well, this wraps up my brief 4 star review of Chick-fil-A on Sahara. It is the closest one to my abode, so I will likely overlook the seemingly flawed parking lot design and busy intersection it is located by and make future stops here for one of my top two picks in the National Fried Chicken Playoff.  Peace out!",

My boyfriend and I even want to cater Chick-Fil-A at our wedding because it identifies us so much. I always brag to everyone that the customer service is incredible and about how your order isn't ever wrong...until this location. WHAT IS GOING ON? I'm going to have to start checking my order before I leave like I'm at McDonalds. (Insert roll eye emoji)   Tonight, I ordered a 6 count nugget kids meal with Chick-Fil-A and Polynesian sauce with a medium Arnold Palmer to drink and a large number 1 with a lemonade to drink. I got Sprite instead of Arnold Palmer, no Polynesian sauce, and my fries are burnt?   The receipt is correct, so I'm not sure where the issue happens, but this happens almost every other time at this location...and it literally BREAKS MY HEART.    I would prefer waiting longer in line to ensure I get the correct order than feel rushed to check that everything is correct in the drive thru (no one wants to be that person) or get home to incorrect items. (Insert pissed off emoji)  Please get it together, so I can continue to share my love for this brand with everyone. I'm tired of hearing, \"it must only be good in the South\".   Disappointed Chick-Finatic,  Update: The past few visits have been much better, and the follow up from the team at Chick-Fil-A shows how much they care about their guests!",

Plenty of employees, but again, it seemed that no one was really running the place.  Post a sign: We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone!

    "text": "Ok, Ok, im a hypocrite. I said on my previous review of In-n-out burger i dont eat fast food which is pretty much True but it seems like the opening of Chick-fil-a is kind of a big deal here in Sin City. If you think about it, this southern based, bible belt, extremly conservative business opening in Sin City seems like, well, committing a sin? Aw heck, its just food. Nothing more, nothing less. The wife wanted to eat here and she pretty much gets what she wants .... pretty much.   So many people but they handle the hungry masses here with grace under pressure. Not 1 but two drive thru lanes with employees outside directing traffic and taking orders. You can tell everything here is process oriented. Despite the hoard of people, the wait in line was less than 5 minutes and no problem finding a table, and this is the location closest to the strip. Plenty of parking. Plenty of outside shaded tables. Plenty of employees on dining room duty to keep the area clean and tables a turning and can you believe it ... drink refills at your table?  Wow! Plus they deliver to your table. The culture with this company is 100% service oriented and it shows. Crew here is very well trained. The key ingredients here are efficiency, value and tasty food. Who would have thought?  They say \"Eat more chikin\"  We say.   \"Great food at a great value\"  The best part? We both ate for under $14.00!",

It was actually kind of dry.  I went back today and had just the basic chicken sandwich.  A LOT better.  Nice and moist.  Like all fast food it was way over salted and I'm spitting dust 3 hours later despite drinking water non-stop since then.  They really need to work on the fries.  They were very hot but still not crisp. Do they pull them out too soon because of the long lines because I would wait a minute longer for a littl crunch!  The best thing was actually Chick-fil-A could give Disney a run for their money on the whole \"happiest place on earth\" thing.  All of the employeers are squeeky clean, super nice without it seeming like it's forced.  Maybe knowning they get every Sunday off is something to smile about!",

Sat down and was approached again with the same little bag by another worker. Which we again said was not our order. Color system is not good because several people had the same color. But high chair came with a new place mat they replace everytime which was great. Everything was spotless and neat. And we got OUR food soon. Chicken nugget are very tiny and we're okay. Chicken sandwhich was very good. Over good experience just not a good idea with the colors given.",

There where people standing outside the door, in line to get in... I decided to time our trip, almost certain that we'd be there for over 30 mins for sure! The line started moving rather quickly. The first person handed me a menu, then the next person took our order and payment. There were 2 lanes of cars and eventually it turned in to one, at that point another person brought our receipt out, then we headed to the end of the drive through. We got our food, then they directed us to the sauce at the end of the cones, that was pretty rad! All of this and we were in and out in under 20 minutes, what!? Yes, it's True! I was amazed, this store gets 10 stars!!",

    "text": "Never in a million years would I think I'd have to write a negative review on one of my favorite fast food restaurants. Tonight I went through the drive thru for my wife and kids to pick up food. I drove all the way from Nellis Air Force base about 30min away because my wife received a receipt with a free chicken sandwich offer. She was told upon receiving receipt to fill out the survey and bring back only the receipt to redeem a free sandwich. I went to redeem offer tonight and was told by the person outside,cashing out orders, that I needed an e-mail also to validate survey offer but manager could help me at window. Long story short. I arrived at window and was greeted by a team member. I told her my name for order and gave her a brief description of what was going on and she attempted to explain it to her manager. The manager who seemed to be overwhelmed and irritated ignored her and at that point I just asked to cancel my order. As soon as I asked that, the manager became interested in the conversation and immediately went to cancel my order. I wasn't helped as stated but more so felt like it was an easy way for her to shorten her drive thru line. I would of had no problem paying for sandwich due to not having e-mail present but the manager seemed to not have interest with assisting an inquiring guest. Chik fil a is always awesome when I go but this location is horrible. I will never return here and I would recommend going here only if you like long lines and below average service. Leadership needs to learn how to be more personable and positive. I honestly felt like I received McDonalds type of customer service tonight! Very disappointing for such a unique and respected fast food chain.",

    "text": "This review is for this location only. I like Chick-Fil-A and have had it numerous times before when I lived in California. Each visit no matter how busy, I've had a pleasant experience until I went to this location. I waited to come visit this store months after it's grand opening because I want to hype to die down a little bit. I went to the drive thru and put the timer  on, just to see how long the wait is, the line wasn't that long so I figured I would be out of there 10 minutes... maybe even 15 minutes top. Well, here's what happened. I see 4, 5 employees taking orders, they have two lanes. Instead of having two employees per lane, I notice one in my lane and 3 on the other lane. Ok, maybe my fault, I went on the wrong line. When I ordered I felt rushed to a point that I accidentally gave them my old card that I reported missing, so of course it's not gonna swipe, when I asked the guy for the card back and offered to give them another card, he said \"oh it approved\". I then drove further. I was stopped by another guy giving out receipts, but was told my card declined. I mean I knew it did so I gave him the other card. I even asked this one approved right??? To which he said, they'll have your receipt at the drive thru window. I was dumbfounded when they can't find my order once I got to the window and had to reorder again and swipe again, even if they had my drink order ready.  I can hear the supervisor say \"we're gonna have a delay, we're barely taking her order\"  They asked for my name again and told me to pull over with my hazards on. I did, but after another 15 minutes of waiting in my car I finally came out and only at that point did I see someone come out with my food. When I asked if that was mine, the girl said, \"I'm not sure, what did you order again? They didn't give me a name or car description\" WTF.  30 minutes of my life wasted for mediocre chicken strips. The strips were to soggy and brown when I got em. Signs of old oil maybe?",

Lemonade was good but the sweet tea wasn't sweet at all. The chicken sandwich was good but the chicken nuggets were disgusting. BBQ sauce was good but the ranch was super watery. The fries are horrible. Not crispy at all & just mushy with no actual seasoning to them. I just don't understand why people hype this place up so much. If I want food chicken, I'll go to Raising Canes where the food actually tastes good for what I'm paying. Chick-fil-A isn't event worth dollar menu prices. I'll never be back.",

I end up having to take time out of my day to sit there and wait for them to go back inside fix the order make it correctly, how it should've been the first time!! I went inside and spoke to the \"manager\" on duty and he gave me an \"I don't care\" attitude. They don't offer you anything. It's like he's used to the customer complaints so he didn't seemed bothered by it. Do yourself a favor and don't go here if your time is valuable and you don't have time to waste. I would suggest you don't go here because they don't care about your order or your time clearly because they continue to mess it up repeatedly.  Over and over again something needs to change. There is a PDQ right down the street and I will go there instead.",

The employee gave our order to the person before us..he said he didn't order that and they took it  back and gave the same order back..not once..but twice before we realized it was our order. The other person put his hands all over it and we had to leave because I was late for work. We asked the manager for a refund and he looked at us and shrugged his shoulders ran the card offered no apology or anything.

I don't like the ridiculously long lines the drive-thru always has though. Seriously it's always a 20 minute wait. Ain't nobody got time for that. Sometimes when they are super busy, there are employees on foot taking orders which helps expedite things. Speaking of employees, they are always super friendly here. They even greet you by your name which personalizes the whole experience.   I really like the chickN minis they serve for breakfast. It's just their chicken nuggets on soft, buttery, mini yeast rolls. So bomb. If you get a combo it comes with hash browns and a coffee. I like their hash browns as well, and they are excellent dipped in the Chick-fil-A sauce. I have a serious obsession with the the CFA sauce. It's amazing. I'd eat it on a shoe it's that good. They are generous with the sauces and usually will give you how ever many you ask for.   For lunch or dinner I enjoy the regular chicken sandwich. It's a real chicken breast, white meat and juicy, on a buttery bun with pickles. Recently they introduced a new drink called the Frosted Sunrise. It's just orange juice and vanilla soft-serve, but it's super goood. I love this place and will continue to stop by whenever I am in the area.",

So when I use to live in the south (Atlanta, GA) I was first introduced to this gold mind of a chicken shack lol Well not snack but you get what I mean!   Las Vegas has been anticipating this place to arrive for so long and finally we have been blessed! I've had so many attempts to try them out over the past few months but of course the hype is oh so real and that drive they line is about as bad as waiting in a line a six flags on a scorching hot day! Now because I've ate here many times before I'm not fool enough to actually wait 45 minutes in a drive thru for a damn chicken sandwich! I feel bad for those workers who have to slave in that heat to go around to each car taking orders because the drive thru doesn't move!   This most recent visit I lucked up and had absolutely no wait so of course I had to eat here! No wait in the drive thru OR inside! SCORE!!! I was in and out within 15 minutes! Is this life?! YES! Will it ever happen again? Who knows! But I hopped my happy ass right back on that I-15 South and chowed down on my spicy chicken sandwich and waffle fries! Washed that down with the summertime watermelon mint lemonade ! Yes Lord! I shall return soon!",

I just left there and they made me a veggie wrap and a refund for the wrap and fries disaster. Wow. Ok.   I do know that if I'm desperate and too lazy to get a sushi burrito a few blocks down, I can go here BUT just check the order after the drive through to make sure I didn't get a mess!!!! From one to three stars because this veggie wrap is really good!!!!!!! (see my pic)  I just wasted $19.10. Oh well. Fail.  Soo for the past 1-2 years ever since MommyTang did a MukBang on vegan at Chick-fil-A I wanted to go there. Even despising the company and their ethics I thought it would be fun.  I wrote a list exactly what to ask for and here is how it turned out: a total disaster.  Super food side: actually this was an edible item. I'm scared to know what the dressing is and I don't like sugar nuts, so those got tossed. For $3 something it was ok.  Fruit cup: smelled kinda weird, like an old refrigerator and I'm pretty sure they toss everything in sugar.  Half unsweetened tea half lemonade: was looking soooo forward to this item but instead it just tastes like a sugar water with lemon juice in it. How much sugar does this company have to put into their products?!?! Wow.  Fries: nightmare. They were half cold, half sooooo fried they crunched like a potato chip. No joke. Somehow they rang up two large sides and I only got one. Also they are soooooo salty they hurt my tongue.   Veggie Cool wrap: it wasn't at all. They gave me a chicken wrap that smelled rotten and the only thing other than chicken on it was lettuce, red cabbage and carrot. This was suppose to be:::: Corn, carrots, black beans, red cabbage, tomatoes, and lettuce, all wrapped in a flaxseed flat bread. Unbelievable.  Sauces: I asked to all the vegan sauces they offer. See my pics. They all tasted the same. Sugar and salt gel. Just different tangy levels.  Call me CLEAN but I have learned my lesson. It's no wonder 'Murica has the diabeetus and super obesity.  I feel sick and dizzy just eating a few fries, some superfood side, a few drinks of sugar salt water, fruit cup, and tastes of sauces.  I called them to tell them about their chicken mess up and the lady who answered sounded like blah blah. She has probably been sugar and salted today.  Two thumbs down. See my pics.",

Pulling in and out of this shopping center is tough and you can be stuck in traffic for a bit depending on what time you eat lunch/dinner.   *The restaurant is pretty big so it's a great place to bring the whole family.  *Location is on and off the I-15 freeway.  *If you're staying at the Palace Station, just walk here to eat vs driving. It will save you a lot of time.   OVER ALL, I totally recommend Chick-fil-A.",

    "text": "I am from the east coast and Chick-fil-a's are everywhere. I simply love chick-fil-a and I will always be a fan.   I visited this location one tuesday morning before work to get me a wheat bagel sandwich with chicken and cheese with a side of hash browns. It took no time for me to order, pay, and receive my food. The workers were pretty happy as all chick-fil-a workers are. However; my reason behind the 4 stars and not 5 is because I waited to eat  my food until I go to work and I was simply disappointed.   My food was hot and fresh and my hash browns were simply fired to golden perfection, however; I had the smallest piece of chicken on my sandwich. The chicken was so small that all I really tasted was cheese and bread. This looked more one of their nuggets than a chicken breast. If my chicken would have been bigger to fit in my bagel then I would have gladly provided 5 stars. I'll defiantly give this location another chance to redeem themselves on the lunch menu, so ill update my review then.  Until next time......",

I tried the egg white grilled chicken English muffin thing on the menu this morning and let me tell you, the English Muffin is where McDonald's is winning. This egg white chicken sandwich was all kinds of disappointing. The grilled chicken was a tiny little piece of thin, chewy poultry. It was over seasoned with black pepper which is a turn off for me. The egg white was just flat and uninteresting as egg whites tend to be. Half of the cheese was on the wrapper and not the sandwich. Just not good. I like the chicken biscuit, the original chicken sandwich and the spicy delux sandwich. Not this egg white grilled...whatever.  I also like the waffle fries at Chick Fil A. As well as the hash browns. Usually. Even those were a let down today. The hash browns were chewy like the rest of my meal. Like they had been re-heated. And I could taste the oil they were fried in. It was either old or over heated. Not good.   I don't think I've ever had a real problem with this location at Rancho and Sahara when it comes to lunch. Breakfast today was just not that good. That said, I appreciate that they had decaf coffee ready. I didn't have to wait for them to brew it like at the other location I usually go to. The coffee could be hotter but it was ready to go and it tastes good. So there you have it.",

    "text": "I gotta lotta love for Chick-Fil-A, we go way back. Our relationship is almost entirely to blame for my Freshman 15, thanks to the location of a CFA in the basement of my dorm. I could literally roll down the stairs and swipe my dining card for a sandwich in the morning and/or do the same on my way back in at night.  Moving to Vegas, without any CFA locations, was an adjustment. I'm happy to have them back for quality on-the-go grub.  The classic sandwich is my go-to,  their lightly-breaded, always-juicy chicken doesn't even need sauce. Nuggets are available for those who can't resist the allure of the Polynesian sauce. The grilled option is available if you need to make good choices, but it's nowhere near as good IMO. Waffle fries are always awesome, though.  The breakfast menu is still fairly new to me, and what I've been acquainting myself with at this new location. The grilled chicken English muffin sando is hearty, but I'd suggest adding some sort of hot sauce for more flavor to start your day.   Service at CFA is comparable to In N Out- they set the standard for their industries by being attentive and polite, all the time. There's a smile on every face, tables are always cleaned, and the lines move fast. I'll happily EAT MOR CHIKIN now that Chick-Fil-A is back in my life!",

    "text": "My first official visit to Chick-fil-A!!  I visited the newest location with a loyal Chick-fil-A veteran one afternoon after hiking at Red Rock. We were starving and decided to check out this location since it was on our way getting back into town.   The drive through line looked horrendously long so we decided to park and go eat inside. The wait was out the door but moved surprisingly quick. I do have to say I was very impressed with Chick-fil-A's staffing (I couldn't even count the number of employees working - they were everywhere and all grinning from ear to ear) and they really ensured a smooth flow of traffic. We ordered while in line with an employee holding a tablet and was at the register paying in less than 10 minutes.   My friend said we HAD to get the: - Spicy Deluxe Sandwich with Pepper-Jack cheese  - Waffle Fries  - Polynesian sauce (really stressed on this) - Sweet Tea and Lemonade  ...It was a tasty chicken sandwich. I think with all the hype and excitement of this fast food chain coming to Las Vegas I was expecting THE ULTIMATE chicken that tasted like no other fried chicken has tasted before. I can't say that I was floored or blown away by my meal (waffle fries were pretty bomb though) but it was definitely a yummy chicken sandwich I would eat again!   I really enjoyed Chick-fil-A! The location on Eastern is more convenient for me but still seems to be extremely busy every time I drive by. Hopefully I can return when it's less chaotic. I look forward to trying their chicken nuggets or strips next time with a different sauce!",

I will say, I think it's in their script to say \"my pleasure\" to every \"thank you\"  I'm a big fan of their spicy deluxe, ice cream cones, waffle fries, chick fil a sauce and their crushed ice.  I'm not a fan of frozen lemonade. I was expecting a lemonade slush and instead it was like a lemon starburst milkshake. Next time, I'll probably go for the basic lemonade or pretty pink watermelon limeade.  If you hate lines or crowds, I'd recommend you save yourself some waiting and order online. You probably wouldn't have to wait that much longer if you order in line though.",

So I sit there for 15 minutes and watch car after car roll through the drive through and not one of them were forced to park out front. Eventually I had to go inside to complain. When I did I asked for a refund and no one seemed to care why I was asking for a refund. Manager never spoke with me, the cashier took my card and receipt and refunded my card. No apology whatsoever. Terrible customer service from start to finish. I would love for someone to respond to why I have to wait out front on the parking lot when I chose to use the drive through. Not holding my breath.  Too many other options to risk going back to this location. And for measure it was 1015 on a Tuesday.  Not exactly prime lunch rush crowd.

We specifically ask for what we want, explain they usually forget some, they said they \"red flagged our order\" so they shouldn't mess up, and what do they do? Mess up! So frustrating, so we ask for more at the window & they have a problem giving it there too, today was the icing on the cake, not only did they deprive me of my favorite sauce , but forgot my sons fries & there was a hair in mine. So disappointing, Chick-fil-A is supposed to be a pleasant experience",

I was waiting outside for my food when one of the workers Yohfed came up to me and asked \"may I refresh your beverage?\". My jaw nearly dropped. I didn't think I heard him right initially. The last time I was asked that way was when I went with my husband to the steakhouse. My food was delivered by Gloria and when we spoke she had the utmost respect for the owner. This you don't hear this everyday. As far as compliments go, that says a lot about the owner. I feel like i am at a restaurant with brynn and everyone coming up to us and if anything else is needed.  I am so coming back here with my family again. Their prices are comparable to Carl's Jr. but the fact that they are happy to see you. This place is packed but they do not neglect on making you feel welcome or making sure your needs are met. Yayyyyy found a new place to enjoy eating out without breaking the bank. Oh Our cashier jasmine was awesome and full of energy too.",

I had to see what the hype was about, and after getting my food, I am still wondering. I ordered a chicken sandwich combo meal with waffle fries and sweet tea. The wet and mushy breading on the sandwich was not appealing to me, but the meat was okay. I have had better. Waffle fries were great. The sweet tea did not have enough flavor, I like to taste the tea notes along with the sweetness, it was to watery for me. Since this was a first visit, I will try something different next time. I usually like to eat healthy, but when I do want fried chicken, I go to Cane's, and loved them from the first bite.",

We're used to McDonald's only giving you 1 sauce for 20 nuggs! The staff was SO friendly, and came to check on us and refilled our cups even though we dined outside.

If I wanted to wait another 15 min, I wouldn't have used the app and gone through the drive thru or ordered to go inside. Take a page from Panera if you're worried about food getting cold or not showing up. On their app, you order, set your pick up time then pay. We'll never use the app and/ order that way ever again!",

I asked for it on the side so I can have it with my fries and sandwich. I reiterated to the checkout thst I wanted extra extra pickles.  I got a little plastic cup with 2 pickles in it.  I went back up and asked for a cup of pickles a s received three more little cups so now I have 6 pickles.  I got to the Fries and it was 4 waffles fries and the rest broken little bits.  My cookie( can't have a meal with out a cookie at chick Fil a ) was nice and cold.  When I asked for the pickles, the manger in the black shirt asked the other shift manager to get me a cup. He came back with the extra little plastic cup. Nobody checked up on me except for an employee, roman, and today is his first day. Maybe he can teach the management about customer service. After a long drive and being from the south a chick Fil a was all I wanted and excited to see it.  I guess I'll have to wait to get back to Georgia for a better experience and food.   A shake shack would have been better. Disappointed!!",

I ordered the #1 Deluxe, and it was awesome. Although this is a fast food joint, the food is hot, fresh and well presented. What's more, their chicken portions are huge and super juicy. I also tried the Polynesian and Chick Fil A sauce and they are TO DIE FOR. I will definitely visit again.   Oh, and one tip- don't forget to download and use their app. They give you awards based on purchases (too bad I forgot to use mine today), and you can even order from the app and just pick it up when you get there.",

Canes has better sauce and bigger portions for sure. I do like the southwest salad here it's pretty good and filling. The line moves pretty quick and it's cool they have the option to place an order through their app. If you don't want to wait I would order ahead and pick it up, so much quicker!",

I surely didn't mind the drive to St. George as it also meant an excuse to go to Zion National Park after, but having one here locally is excellent! At first I was worried that a location next to the strip would be overly packed but since our wasn't too far from my work I wanted to give this one a whirl.   I was immediately pleasantly surprised at how ample the parking was compared to the other two locations in town, it was so easy to find a spot! Walking in the door I was immediately greeted by a friendly employee who took my order while I waited in line to get to the register. That meant simply walking up with my drink waiting for me and just having to tap my phone to pay. The staff was beyond courteous, the food was fresh, hit, and delicious as one would expect from Chick Fil A, and the dining room was very clean and looked extremely nice. I got a great smile out of the painting of the strip bathed in Chick Fil A signs and logos.   This will easily be my go to spot for Chick Fil A and I'm glad it's finally here!",

I ate here on a Wednesday night for a short break in the middle of a long drive. The food is typical Chick-fil-A quality and the service is the same. The reason for the 4 star rating here is the fact they they do not have trays if you are dining in. Food is given in a bag and your basically eating off the table with napkins. Overall I am satisfied.",

It was great for a small meal to get me through until dinner and I couldn't finish it all! This is definitely great for kids and or people who need to get in and get out.  Polynesian Sauce - 5/5 Stars - it kind of tastes like sweet/sour sauce without the spice. It does get a little too much after the 5th bite.  Chick-Fil-A Sauce - 5/5 Stars - this tastes amazing, which makes sense since it's named after their branch lel. It's hard to describe but believe me it tastes great with waffle fries and your chicken. --- Service - 6/5 Stars - some of the best customer service I've experienced at any fast food restaurant. The line was already long to begin with. I entered and was waiting at the door and within 3-5mins I was already ordering my food. The staff checked up on me asking how I was doing and brought out my meal in a timely, quick manner.  --- Overall - 5.5/5 Stars - if I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. I don't understand why this place is rated 3.5 when it clearly deserves a 5. I highly suggest coming here if you're in the mood for some waffle fries, chicken, and great service!",

I love the spicy chicken sandwich an the regular chicken as well. The wraps are pretty good too. It's quick business as well. I love how when it's busy they take your order an you pay right away. Wow drive up get your food an your on your way home. Prices are very reasonable for combos or if you want just the sandwich. I like that they are closed in Sunday's which gives everyone a day to do their thing whatever that may be. So head over an get yourself something. You won't be disappointed",

The drive through and the in store eat in lines are disgustingly long and expect to wait between 15-40 min on average especially on the weekend.  CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH: HUGE HUGE HUGE TIP- USE THE MOBILE APP- it takes 3-5min to register and add your credit card, then when you pull up like when my hubby and I did on a Saturday, your wait will be 5 min instead of the long time u need to usually wait.   Best best best idea ever to get the app and preorder your order- only downside of the app is that you can't grab all the goodies like the extra sauces/honey/Mayo because the app limits you to 3 items per order.  Also make sure, make sure you press on the app- the IM HERE button or else you will just sit in the car- that way they know to make ur order when ur pulling up.  There was no line in the mobile pick up.  Best best best way to grab Chick-a-fil when your craving it.",

I opt for the right for no particular reason. Three cars have gone past on the left and in front of me is what looks like a long-winded conversation between the employee and person in the driver's seat of the car. While I am a huge fan of human interaction and good customer service, it's about ten o'clock pm and I just want my chicken strips that are as soft as buttah. I'm also thinking to myself that I just don't want to wait in line as the employee gives her doctoral dissertation.  Finally I make it up to her and I immediately feel guilty for being so impatient. This girl is chipper, sweet and polite. After taking my order, she clearly deserves five stars for being so nice and having to deal with the public. I drive up and give my money to another chipper employee who calls me by my first name. Nice touch.   I drive up to the food window and two more employees are chipper, prompt and both call me by my first name. Five-star drive-thru service game.  One star missing because the sweet tea was not sweet enough and tasted like water. Also this particular location does not carry coleslaw. I guess I am the only one who likes coleslaw with their fried chicken? I was SUPER pleased to try the super-food salad and so glad I opted for the large. My coleslaw disappointment immediately dissapated after trying this salad. I think they need to package the nutmix. I will buy it in bulk. Delicious.   I really can't tell you what the hoopla is about Caine's. I prefer the chicken at Chic Fil A 100% more. It is much more tender and the sauce can't be beat!   One of my friends won't eat with me at this restaurant due to her political stance towards the company. Super glad I get to live in a country where we all get to voice our opinions. My opinion is that this is one of the few companies left that have a dynamic positive culture that is shown through and through in the way it's employees interact with the public while also serving consistently good food.",

    "text": "Walked in with my buddy for a quick lunch, I have a psychiatric service dog I was carrying with me and they decided it was a good idea to stop me before I got to the counter. I was questioned and harassed for about 10-15 minutes about my animal even though it was making no noise, not touching the ground, or being disruptive at all.   I was repeatedly asked illegal questions and had fulfilled my obligations as far as what I'm required to answer, the owner Cole Donahoo and his manager Don Thomas both would not listen to me when I attempted to educate them on the ADA concerning service animals. After about 20 minutes, many warnings and other customers stepping in to defend me, Cole decided that it was wise to serve me (he comped my meal and my friends meal although I told him it wasn't going to matter) and it seemed he was just doing damage control after publicly embarrassing me in front of a line of 15+ people who we could hear talking about the scene. Both were extremely rude, condescending, and arrogant. I'm impressed Chik Fil A allows people like this to represent their brand.   When I made a corporate complaint, they sent him my number and he called me, which was the last thing I wanted. He offered zero resolution and did nothing to compensate for the humiliation he put me through. When I said I was considering litigation, he told me he would call me back after a few days. Surprise, surprise, he never called me back.   Single handedly the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, they do not care about the customer and they are certainly incompetent human beings. I won't be coming back and I will be pursuing justice. Just makes me wonder how many other people with legitimate service animals have been turned down service or disrespected to this degree who don't know their rights or just don't want to be embarrassed in front of a line of people. Unacceptable.  Not only did he admit he didn't know what he was talking about, he told me I was right when he called me. I asked him \"if you don't know something, how can you act so confident when arguing and humiliating someone?\" He had no answer. Quite the scene for someone who represents a Christian branded company, zero compassion.",

The Chick-fil-A at Rancho Drive, has great customer service. Our order got mixed up with someone else's order and they were so apologetic,  unlike some other fast food establishments.  Their Manager, Cynthia gave us such great customer service, above and beyond. We deeply appreciated that. I would definitely recommend this place!",

I just don't comprehend why a soggy bun, hot lettuce and hot tomatoes are what people are craving. Then, if you are driving, you better have some utensils and lots of napkins...they don't put sauce on the sandwiches for you...you get to do it yourself. That's really convenient while driving btw. Since I forgot my traveling eating utensils, I tried to put sauce on myself...no fun. So, back to the sandwich. If I wanted to eat hot lettuce and hot tomatoes, I can microwave that at home. Upon eating hot lettuce and tomatoes, I realized I do not like vegetables that are supposed to served cold, so thank you for teaching me that life lesson that I did not need to learn. Upon closing, Jack in the Box has a much better chicken sandwich for $1.50! And...drum roll please...the lettuce on the sandwiche is cold.",

The only reason I went to order food here is because it's new in town and just wanna try it. I know they have opened one or two in town but I've never gone and I decided to check this one out because it's close to my house.

I have always enjoyed going to Chick-Fil-A because they give you as many sauces as you would like, people come around and ask how you're doing and if you would like a refill on your beverage. I rarely get mistakes on my order. This pains me to say it but this Chick-Fil-A isn't up to par with the other Chick-Fil-A restaurants I've been to. My order was wrong, I wasn't given my drink order correctly, when I asked for sauces the employee didn't give me what I asked and literally counted the sauces she had already given me and acted like McDonalds. I didn't get the usual \"my pleasure\" attitude from here either. I have always gotten the sweetest employees at Chick-Fil-A's except for this one. It was pretty disappointing.",

Despite the scary drive thru, it's very organized and easy to get through. I don't think I've waited for more than 15 minutes (even during peak lunch time). There are multiple employees available to take your order, keep the lanes organized, take your payment, and give you your order. Seriously, there are employees everywhere.   I keep it simple with the Chik-Fil-A sandwich and waffle fries. I load up on sauces as well. All of them are great. Tried the chocolate chunk cookie, omg it's divine. Definitely my favorite chocolate chip cookie next to Nordstrom's \"Nordie\" cookie.   Hoping to try the shakes later, but I don't want to test the limits of my waistband!",

    "text": "Well i use to live in California where i loved it.... But my 1st time here in Vegas & though the line inside to eat moved quickly less than 5 minutes i ordered a #2 Spicy Chicken Sandwich meal & a 4 pc tenders Dine in.... Total was $13 & some change no problem i knew the prices going in.... Now the problem I'm having after sitting waiting for my food i notice there were 2-3 people who already received there food & an employee walking around asking some who havent received there order myself included are you & is your name Robert or Roberto?.... Still waiting i see a group of 6 people get there food.... I now get up walk to the counter... I'm assuming on of the managers may i help you? I answer yes I've been waiting for my order? I give them my name & receipt i say Tony but my name was never asked for by the cashier.... One employee says his order is right here under Roberto (if this isn't a stereotype or racist shit I've heard) yea I'm not Roberto i repeat i was never asked to give my name.... The one employee states we will get you a fresh order i say ok already upset & highly disappointed at this point.... Then the original guy who started to help me says here you go sorry about the inconvenience & gives me a free sandwich card?... I guess thanks goes through my head.... I sit down still to eat it there & fries were soggy as was the sandwich!!!! Strips were extremely soggy too!!! Clearly weren't made fresh for me already knowing they didn't by passing me this garbage of a free sandwich card maybe comp my meal i just paid for since it was literally over 15-20minutes old.... None of the problem was my doing? I'm a general manager of a papa John's pizza & mistakes do happen if need be fix the mistake & please the customer!   #1 Name was never asked for at time of order= not my mistake it's your cashier  #2 When walking around with my order instead of asking me or any other customer if are name is Robert or Roberto check receipt to see if order matches.  #3 Don't say you're going to remake my order fresh for me & not do so.  #4 i understand you want sales but maybe Refund me or make my soda & fries Large size now for the wait...   #5 is what you decided to do... Give me a free sandwich card... So yea i guess thanks... But i don't agree with how unapologetic the were sorry was... It was as though this location messes up often & just said Oops give this guy a card... Just horrible... I'd give zero stars if i could",

    "text": "I'm so happy that Chic-fil-A finally opened in Vegas. My husband and I were first introduced to it by a friend a few years back and we just loved it. One location did open up a couple months back in Henderson, but the lines were terrible and my friend had gone to the opening of it and waited 4 hours in the cold to get it. When I heard they opened one closer to my school I just had to try it. The best thing was that they had a whole system worked out in the drive through from taking your order, to checking out, giving you for order, and even a staff member was assigned to give you their specialty sauces. The process was easy and painless to go through the drive through and it only took is less than 10 minutes which was great because I was so scared to wait for 4 hours in the drive thru! Well the food did not disappoint and even the lemonade I tried for the very first time was super delicious. Overall, I love how they have an awesome system going on and their food was great.",

I ignored the Henderson location until the one in Rancho and Sahara opened. It's still a far drive from my place but I said, what the heck I want to check out what the buzz is all about.   We went there after a little past 8pm on a Friday night, we were prepared to wait forever but surprisingly there wasn't any line for dine in, but the drive thru was very busy.   For a fast food chain, they have a very fresh quality food. I ordered the Spicy Deluxe and it was really good. The waffle fries was a little undercook for me so next time I'll order them well done/extra crispy. The service was very fast and the staff are super friendly. The fine in area is also clean. Just FYI, the drinks are behind the counters next to the register, but you do get refills for as many as you want.  And the staff are very good with checking on you if you need any refills or extra sauce. My favorite dipping sauce is their Garlic Ranch.   Will definitely go back here again!",

BUT for some reason they've been getting a little stingy on handing these little tasty packets over to the public. When I ask for 4 honey roasted bbq sauce packets to compliment my nuggets and fries I want 4 packets. I came to the conclusion that 4 was adequate via a very precise algorithm. Free the sauce I beg of you.",

Similar to In-n-out, they have people taking orders outside to make the line go faster. Pretty efficient.   We ordered a spicy chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets, and the waffle fries. Also got the chick-fil-a sauce.  The spicy chicken sandwich was surprisingly good. The chicken was very crispy on the outside, crispier than the nuggets. The chicken itself was tender and moist. It is just a tad spicy but I do feel like it could use some sauce so I added some chick-fil-a sauce which worked with it too so regardless, probably the best chicken sandwich I've had. Would recommend.   The nuggets, like the chicken in the chicken sandwich, was crispy on the outside and tender inside. However while it wasn't as crispy as the sandwich, it was still good.   Even though I don't really eat fries, these were delicious. It came piping hot. It's lightly salted, is crisp on the outside yet soft inside. I think the waffle cut is cool too.   They also have grilled chicken options for a healthier alternative which I might try in the future.   Overall, would definitely visit their other locations in the future.",

My friend bought a number 1 and I got treated out to a chocolate smoothie and some waffle fries. Loved the customer service from ordering to our food being delivered to our table and once we were done they threw away our trash before we could even get up. I wasn't a fan of the smoothie because my stomach hurt drinking it not even half way. The waffle fries were cute but real waffles would've been excellent. My friend was super disappointed in the chikin being way too salty and the burger was super plain with no lettuce cheese but just a pickle. After two bites he literally said Wendys and Raising Canes were much more better. Besides the food not being something I would go back for, this place is pretty big in size with decorations to look at such as the coke bottles on all the tables.",

Anyway, I ended up getting a regular Chick-fil-A which was a scrawny piece of fried chicken on a dry bun maybe two inches wide and two small pickle slices - that's it!  Are you kidding me? No sauce, no lettuce, cheese.....nothing. Meat on a bun is not a sandwich!  The waffle fries were horribly under cooked, white to yellowish mush cooked long before served and barely warm. I have absolutely NO idea how this franchise can possibly exist. It's simply a horrible product.",

They are usually so nice and helpful, so I will (sorta) give them a pass. But it gets my goat when I wait in line for 15 minutes in the blazing hot heat in my overly hot car (A/C did not hold up to 110 degrees today), and then when I pull away I discover this oversight.  But the chicken is a treat! Fried chicken on a soft bun with pickles, cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes and onion. That's the Deluxe Chicken Sandwich. And crispy waffle fries have the perfect level of saltiness (but they are better with ketchup!)  Also, try their grilled chicken options and salads if you're concerned about your waistline...but eh, live a little.",

The drive through process is so easy, efficient, and never a hassle! I always have a great experience at chic-fil-A whether it's in Las Vegas, Denver, or Southern Cali!  If your not into the fried options, there are a ton of alternatives as well! On those days I enjoy the grilled strips, grilled chicken on whole wheat, the chicken wrap, soup, and or a side salad! Great for on the go food! I mean who doesn't like Chic-fil A!",

It's almost like they go through some elite training course. This was my first visit to a dining location. I'm thinking this is fairly a new because of the modern architect and it's kind of away from busy area. This location does have a drive thru for your convenience. The last two locations that I visited were more of an express site at a mall and at the airport. So you can order your food like normal and they'll bring your food to your table. They don't give you a number stand thingy but they somehow know your order magically.  Staff are really pleasant and they take pride in what they do. I usually get the regular chicken sandwich and some chicken nuggets. I love all their chicken sauces too. They are always cook to its perfection and so juicy and good. Oh yeah, they're closed on Sundays so don't even think about coming here.",

    "text": "I was craving for some late night munchies. It's nice that this Chick-fil-A location is still open. Arriving one hour prior to closing is enough time to place an order and still dine in without feeling any pressure to hurry. The girl who place the order is friendly and she even made time to answer question and accommodate specific food request.   I ordered the Waffle Potato Fries with Spicy Deluxe Sandwich which has lettuce, tomato, chicken, and pepper jack cheese. The chicken is crispy yet tender and the waffle fries has a soft texture crunch. They have different kinds of dipping sauce to choose from polynesian, garlic & herb ranch, honey mustard, barbecue, sweet & spicy sriracha, and zesty buffalo. Personally, I like a balance of flavor and prefer the sweet & spicy sriracha for the waffle fries.   Chick-fil-A makes freshly squeezed lemonade which I feel is perfect to have for a summer drink. I'm not enthused about having too many options and I like the fact that they offer a simple menu. They make good quality fast food. I will probably try the Spicy Southwest Salad or have a Grilled Cool Wrap on my next visit.",

Twice dining in we had to let the manager know, once we got all the way home and found it missing bacon?!!  Last night went in the drive thru and had a feeling to check and the one \"protein style club\", yup we guessed it, missing both cheese and bacon! Had to get out of my car and go to the window and asked for a manager and got James. Waited again with no excuse to give, and after letting him know this was at least the 3rd time this happened at this location, and all I got was \"I apologize for that\".  I was told Jessie was the store manager and want to let him know, this is by far the least inconsistent Chic Fil a we've been to and just get your employees to value their job a little more.

Rancho and Sahara is one of the busiest intersections in town and building the first Vegas location of Chick-Fil-A here didn't sound like the best of ideas.  However, we've been able to find parking easily on both visits, once at night and today around 10:30am.  The best thing to do if you want to beat the line is use the CFA app and do a mobile order, which my boyfriend usually does.  Your food comes out quickly and then you can still grab a seat in or outside the restaurant.  We didn't use the app today since the line wasn't that long.  As with every other CFA location, this one has very friendly and attentive customer service.  The staff checks on you throughout your meal and you can get free drink refills from them so you never have to leave your table.  The chicken nuggets are my favorite and make a great little snack.  Having this location here actually makes it convenient to EAT MOR CHIKIN since it is so close to the 15 freeway.  When we need our Chick fix, we'll be here.",

We love Chick-fil-a. The food quality for fast food is great.   For me, I love their cool wrap - a grilled chicken flatbread wrap with vegetables and cheese. Pair it with the avocado lime ranch dressing, you got yourself some good eats for fast food. The salads are also pretty good as well.  My toddler prefers the grilled nuggets and is a huge fan of the fruit cup. I like that they have mini board books for kids under 3. I also like the kind of toys they include in the kids meal. Clearly, their toys are specifically currated to be fun yet educational at the same time.   The hubs is totally into the original chicken sandwich with the honey BBQ sauce. He also loves the spicy chicken sandwich as well. He finds the fried chicken crispy yet retaining it's moist inner texture. The seasoning is not overly aggressive which is nice for younger palates like my toddler.  We usually always get the sweet tea and the lemonade. Both taste nearly home made. The lemonade especially is worth the extra surcharge.  Things you can skip? Personally, I am not a fan of their soups. They taste like a slightly fancier version of Campbell's.  The environment is exceptionally clean for a fast food chain. Fresh flowers on the table, specialized disposable placemats for kids, plentiful highchairs - these are all elements of a family sort of place.  The drive thru is always busy but there is always seats available for dining inside the restaurant. Weekends are always really busy and it is not atypical to see a line put the door during lunch hours. Luckily, they are staffed quite well so things generally run smoothly. The staff is usually helpful and polite.  Given all these factors, this place gets a four started review.",

When we went to Las Vegas for Labor Day weekend, we decided to stop by your location on Sahara and the I-15 for food before driving home to LA. We were met with two lane of confusion, stressed out employees, cars in drive thru lane trying to back up and a very rude manager named Amanda when we asked what is going on and why our food takes 15 min to be served and all she can offer was a \"cone of ice cream\" for the inconvenience. This is NEVER the type of service we get in California as we are used to the \"my pleasure\" greetings.   I think that the manager Amanda should be reprimanded for the attitude that she presented as she is a representative of the company and the team retrained -- how to handle busy days.   I did not appreciate being treated like it was OUR FAULT that we messed up our order or waited 15-20 min for our food.",

The location is in a pretty good spot with ample parking & access to the highway. The line was out the door but 2 employees took orders efficiently & customers just paid at the cashier.   Seating areas were clean & employees were super friendly. Food was warm & so good. No complaints here. Glad you're here now Chik-fil-A. It means no more random drives to St. George, lol. :)",

But We decided to try them out, the wait was horrible and the greeter they has greeting people she was just a little prissy and had an attitude. WE ordered two chicken sandwiches and when we opened them they looked WAY overcooked and very hard to eat. (I will try and post a picture of them) Ask a manager about them and he said \"Sorry we are a little busy and I can't do anything to help you, nest time come back when were not so busy or try a different menu item, Let me tell you RUDE RUDE customer serve and horrible chicken.

Also not even a sign or anything, I had to wait for a kid to approach me from the inside and tell me so. Terrible image on such an important fast food chain.  #embarassing #shame",

I think they have more important things to do than deal with a fast food place traffic. Really now? I will not visit this fast food place again. Their food is dry and not tasty at all.

The biscuit is not like a regular biscuit more like a Hawaiian roll.  There are multiple ways to get your chicken and go. The lines and wait could take some time, in a rush, don't wanna wait? Download the app place your order and swing by when it's done.  Recently I was told about the frosted coffee, a mix of ice cream and coffee  you better believe I had to try it! It was amazing!!!!

I'm also amazed at the diversity of both the staff and customers at most if not all of the locations I've been to. Haters gonna hate, I guess... but those of us who ignore the fake propaganda and actually try the place are pleasantly surprised that there doesn't appear to be any validity to the BS spread in some circles.  During this visit, I got to see training in action... there were at least two trainees - one at the register next to the one I placed my order at, and one out on the floor. While I was placing my order, the gentleman next to me politely told the trainee at the register that she gave him too much change. She was embarrassed and confused of course, and the person taking my order immediately diverted her attention in support of the trainee. The trainer who was looking over her shoulder also jumped in with gentle, positive, reassuring guidance. Well done! I was very impressed with what I saw and heard.  While sitting in my booth, a couple of little kids wandered up to me with drinks in their hands... pointing at my phone, saying \"you have one of those cases that makes it impossible to break the phone...\" I smiled and agreed, but wasn't for a minute going to let them test it. They then bumped into each other, splashing some of their sodas on the floor and raced off. I pointed the small puddle out to an employee on the floor and could tell she was processing in her head \"OK, what are my actions here\" - another brand new trainee! After a quick second of thought, she went and immediately got a \"wet floor\" sign. A manager on the floor saw her doing that and came over to discuss further actions - again, in a very positive and helpful manner.  I was impressed by the interactions. The trainees were learning by doing, but they weren't abandoned or ridiculed. Everything was very positive. Seems like a great place to work!",

    "text": "5-star service/staff. Last week I ordered 200+ chicken sandwiches for an event we were having at Nellis. I coordinated the event with Jordan on the phone a few weeks back and everything was smooth. I came on the date/pick up this was the first time I have ever been to this location. I had to wait a few minutes for them to finish packing up my order (they even put them into their nice, big heater bags so all my sandwiches stayed nice and hot!) and Ms. Lacey and her crew helped put it in my vehicle. It was a seamless experience. The one thing that really stood out to me was that even though this location was clearly super, super busy (Thursday at 10:30 and there was already a line!), every single staff member there had a positive vibe that was just really contagious.  Everyone was friendly and had a smile on like they were happy to be working there. This made a huge difference for me. The wait wasn't too long from my observation with the customers (that weren't ordering 200 sandwiches like I was). So I came back the very next day to return the heater bags, and I brought my 12 yr old daughter back with me to grab some lunch.  This was her first time at a Chick-Fil-A and well...she fell in love with the place lol. She says the chicken sandwich is \"soooooo delicous! I want this for my birthday!\" I had the caramel coffee slush. It tasted yummy! So, this was Friday around dinner (5:45pm). They were, once again, super busy! But the customer service was just as good, not to mention very efficient! Thank you Chick-Fil-A Sahara for your amazing staff and service. The ONLY thing I don't like is the layout of the parking lot/drive-thru in that shopping center where they are located.  It's super tight and a bit hard to get in and out of, especially if you're trying to get back on I-15 North at rush hour. You'll just have to get creative in finding a different route to get back out. We will be back very very soon (probably with another large catering order :)",

So I stopped and got me and my friend dinner and surprisingly it wasn't crowded. I had to wait about 5 minutes for fresh fries and chicken sandwiches but it was worth the wait.   Service always exceeds my expectations and I swear they need CHICK-FIL-A UNIVERSITY on customer service and having great food. I came all the way to Lake Meaty & Hollywood and our food was still hot.   I will continue to go here no matter what their beliefs are cuz they have really good food and care about their customer.

But my husband and I where up early and running errands first thing in the morning and drove by. We decided to give them a second look.   I had the chicken, egg and cheese bagel with fruit. I like the hearty, grains of the bagel, the taste of the chicken, egg and cheese. It was made to order and was fresh. The choice of side is also a plus. The fruit is fresh, not 'mushy' and still had some crispness.   The time from order to table was a bit of a wait but for a weekend morning they where really busy. Overall very satisfied with breakfast, just might have to go back and try lunch or dinner again!",

I will say that the service here isn't quite as amazing as it is in other states, but I chalk that up to it being a new style of service style & it takes time to find the right people for any new biz in a new town.

    "text": "Just to note - our first time having Chick-Fil-A, no childhood memories are involved at all.   Got to this location at 12:15 on a Wednesday and the line was out the door. We were leery but reviews said they move quickly so we ventured forth. It's True, they're very quick and also quite friendly. There were 2 employees taking orders from the line using tablets, then we just gave our name at the register to pay and get our sauces and drinks. We sat at a table and our food was brought to us shortly. I thought it was odd that they bagged it to go when we were dining in, but that didn't matter.  First note, hubby's lemonade - beyond tart. He grabbed some sugar packets to try to tone it down but it's a safe bet that we won't order that again. My Coke was fine, though slightly overfilled. It took a couple of napkins to clean up the overflow and I was glad that I didn't have to deal with that in my car.  The table wasn't cleaned before we sat down but it also wasn't completely gruesome. At that point in time, we just considered ourselves lucky to have even found an open table. It was cleaner when we left than when we arrived.  Now, the food. Hubby got the spicy original chicken sandwich with sriracha sauce and waffle fries. He ended up not using the sauce as the sandwich was exactly perfect on its spiciness and he didn't want to ruin it. The sandwich was a definite hit. The fries, sadly, were just average. Good potato flavor but not crunchy and it could have benefited from a bit more salt. Overall, he's a fan now.  I got the original chicken sandwich with the original Chick-Fil-A sauce and opted for the fruit cup instead of waffle fries. The sandwich was fantastic, tender and juicy chicken, seasoned nicely and not greasy. The sandwich only has pickles on it so I used the sauce which was slightly sweet and went well with the chicken. I was impressed with the fruit cup because it wasn't 90% melon like most fruit cups. In fact, there wasn't any melon, it was mostly apple pieces with some blueberries, strawberries, and mandarin oranges. The end result, I'm also a fan.  We'll happily eat at Chick-fil-a again but it probably won't be soon. None of their locations are in the NW so it's not exactly handy.",

But they moved quickly and you can order through an employee with an iPad while you're in line, which makes the experience move really quickly. What set the experience apart?   As we sat outside finishing our meal, a manager walked up and asked us how the meal went. He then asked us if we wanted a refill on our drinks and if we needed anything else!

    "text": "This review reflects my recent fattyness.... I don't like it! But I do like Chick-fil-A! One late night, my sweetheart and I decided to be happy (instead of skinny) and made our way to Chick-fil-A. On a late Tuesday night, this place was buzzing! After trying the food, I can see why. I ordered a Deluxe sandwich with waffle fries and strawberry shake; my honey had nuggets, spicy sandwich, and waffle fries. Can I just say, I LOVE waffle fries! I didn't think it was going to be crispy when i saw it, because it looked so pale but thankfully they were. Phew! Soggy fries is a \"no bueno\". The sandwiches were great. I really enjoyed my deluxe - it comes with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and cheese. So yummy! Strawberry shake was good too, nothing fancy. Oh and chicken nuggets were great, crispy and juicy. I appreciate Chick-fil-A having a variety of sauces, I sampled all of them and enjoyed Ranch the most. Even though the restaurant was busy, we ordered though the app on our way there and got out food within a couple of minutes at a pick up window. Great option since the drive though looked super busy! I like the quality and ease of getting the food. There are options for the skinny-fat days too :) Those are the days when you lie to yourself and say that you'll be \"healthy\" but go to a fast food restaurant to get your meal... you know who you are ;)",

This frozen lemonade was like a shake, but frothier, and with a nice citrus flavor. Turns out that I like citrus as much as I like chocolate; something I only discovered a few years ago. I may have led a sheltered food life until my 40's. I also had their salad with the blueberries and strawberries. I know, I'm doing Chick Fil A wrong. The salad was a really nice surprise, especially for a fast food place. We went to the one on Sahara and the 15. It seems to be the only one open until midnight during the week.",

Maybe it's a Vegas thing especially on  that side of town but I don't get that vibe from Henderson Chick Fil-A.  Not cool cause this is the one most tourists probably go to.  Let's face it; tourists keep Vegas alive and vibrant so let's show them Vegas ROCKS.   Speaking of which, across the street isn't very safe so just make sure to grab your goodies and go!  There's a Siegel/Budget Suites there.  Need I say more?",

I had to tell him \"so do i get drinks with the meals\" and he said \"oh ok\" then was gonna hang up without me telling him the drinks. I then call back 15min later to make sure it would be ready because i only get 30min for lunch. They assured me that it was being worked on and would be ready. I get there and they ask for a name i tell them they never asked for a name then they were gonna start my order right then. I told them im gonna be late if i wait so i left. So now not only did i waste gas, time, and effort i still didn't get anything to eat and have to go work another 5 hours. Will never go there again. My co-workers warned me!!!! If you want inaccurate service and being lied to then go to this location. Very disappointed!!!!!",

I usually use the drive thru and this time we ate in. While this location is always  pretty busy, they do an excellent job turning over tables and getting the cars in the drive thru their orders quickly. I have to say, the welcoming demeanor of the staff there is wonderful. They are all so friendly and  Brooklyn, Angelika, and everyone there went above and beyond.

That said, if you have the option to beat the lunch crowd arrive at 1100 PST, or use the Chick-Fil-A mobile app and order in advance. This location gets SLAMMED at lunch nearly EVERYDAY.

    "text": "I'm not quite sure WHY Chick-fil-A is the hype. Because it was on our \"to try\" list, we gave it a spin.  First of all, when you get through the long line that spans out the door, the ordering process is straightforward. The line, however, does move quite fast. So even though it's outside, you'll move fairly quickly. The drive thru, that's another story. The line was spanning out of the parking lot onto Rancho Drive during lunch. I wouldn't bother. Probably would be best to order via the app and pick it up and the pick-up window, which they do have.  I tried the 12-piece nuggets combo with the waffle cut fries. I try nuggets everywhere, so I'd like to think that I'm a connoisseur of chicken nuggets. And you know, I honestly didn't think that the nuggets were all that great. This would be dead last on my list. There is a hint of sweetness to the batter, which I found to be odd. I also felt that I HAD to dip it in ketchup or the sauce in order to make it taste decent. I had ranked Burger King on the list of chicken nuggets that were dead last because they don't taste too good. The Chick-fil-A ones, they are now dead last. Heck, Burger King's nuggets are wonderful compared to Chick-fil-A.   My wife tried the chicken sandwich. She said it was \"forgettable.\" I took a bite of the breaded patty, and while it was \"decent,\" it was forgettable.   The waffle cut fries, however, was quite good. But you can't just have great fries! You need tasty main dishes as well, and sadly, Chick-fil-A does not. And to be honest, Carl's Jr. has better waffle cut fries.  We ordered and dined in. The food arrived quickly and was adequate in temperature. I like how they will bring the food to your table.  Maybe we will go back and try them again. Maybe we will try something else. But until then, we have no desire to go back any time soon.",

Today, August 12 we stopped by for lunch to see how things were going.  As always, this restaurant was extremely busy.   Upon walking in, the staff were taking orders with an iPad type of device.  When we arrived at the window, the order was again repeated to us ensuring that the order was correct.    WHAT COULD GO WRONG  The order came to our table hot.   All the items were just about perfect.     The store was clean, the trash cans were empty.     We will be back again.",

    "text": "First off, Chick-fil-A is no big deal to me. I've been eating it all my life. It used to only be in malls like Hot dog on a stick. I used to always eat it at the mall as a kid/teenager. I had not had it since I left Texas in 2012 and I ain't driving to Henderson just for a sandwich and some nuggets. The drive thru line is like In-N-Out which is crazy. I'm not waiting that long. So I look online and see they have an app!   I get the app and place my order. When I get there I tap, \"I'm here.\" I park in the parking lot and go up to the app order window. Employees everywhere are always polite and that's especially unusual in Vegas so it's even more appreciated. You also get rewards for using the app. It was excellent not to have to wait in line.   We ordered a kids meal (nearly $8.00!), Two sandwich combos and 2-12 piece nuggets. It was $35.00. It's much cheaper in Texas!   I get in the car and can't wait to eat. Then I realize they forgot my sandwich. The kid at the window was a sweetheart. I'll revise and add his name. He gave me my sandwich no problem and realized he forgot to scan the app on my phone. Then he tells me to order a water on my app since it's free so I can get credit for both purchases.   He was very enthusiastic and friendly and talked about how much he likes his job. That's so refreshing to hear in this town where everyone seems to be hopeless.   We will be back often. It's a staple. You can't avoid it.",

I always get the number one. Whenever going to a chain of any sort I always go with their main item-as that should be the best offering. You cannot go wrong. The barn is soft the fried chicken is juicier than ever conceived possible and yet crispy at the same time. Each sandwich comes with a pickle on it which adds the perfect amount of kick. I adore the waffle fries, not too greasy perfectly salted and delightful in every possible way. My favorite sauce offering is the honey mustard. I always asked for extra so I can keep it at home.  The staff here reminds me of Kentucky, in the southern hospitality type of manner. Always smiling, ready to serve you in anyway you need, and genuinely happy that you have come to visit. We will continuously come back to Chick-fil-A.  It's wonderful to have a small piece of Kentucky here in beautiful Las Vegas, and our taste buds are ecstatic about it!",

    "text": "I prefer beef, but will EAT MOR CHIKIN every once in a while.  If you didn't know, Chick-fil-A finally decided to open in Las Vegas.  The first two locations are actually located in Henderson.  So technically, this is the very first Las Vegas location.  I drove by on their first day of business and was shocked that the drive-thru had only 4 cars in line.  Well that was last week.  The word is out.  This Chick-fil-A is open and it is busy.  The drive-thru line was long, but looked quick and organized.  After cars pay and pick up their food, they're directed to a separate tent where they can get their dipping sauces.  The lines inside the restaurant made it to the doors, which isn't that long.  We are pros at busy Chick-fil-A's and will take advantage of the One App whenever there's a line. We ordered ahead, waited 7 minutes & 23 seconds, and picked up our food.  We dined inside and it wasn't crowded at all. The restaurant is very clean and sports a lot of Chick-fil-A Vegas advertising.   Chick-fil-A didn't invent the chicken, just the chicken sandwich.  That's one of their mottos.  If you haven't been to Chick-fil-A, then I suggest that you try the Original Chicken Sandwich with their chicken strips or nuggets.  In my opinion, the Original Chicken Sandwich is just okay.  It's their nuggets, both grilled and breaded, that I love.  Each chicken nugget is made with real chicken meat, just enough breading, and taste so good.  Their grilled chicken nuggets is the bomb too.  I can't end a Chick-fil-A review without mentioning their waffle fries.  These are the best and there's no wrong way to eat them.  EAT MOR WAFFUL FRYS!!!",

It's just NO DIFFERENT than any other chicken. Defiantly better than McDonald if that's a compliment.  The drive through took exactly 24 minutes for one sandwich. Totally wasn't worth a half hour of my life. The girls working the drive thru were amazing. Very sweet and polite and kept a 30 minute wait of cars very well organized. So kudos to the staff.  A huge NO-NO a member did was compare their sauce to Raising Canes sauce. That's one thing you don't do with competitors is compare your own product to theirs. In the long run Canes sauce is so much better but that shouldn't be said by staff.  I'm sure the hype will die down. But until then I have about 4 Canes here to choose from with the same quality food if not better and a lot shorter of a wait.   Keep up the great work staff!!",

The last couple of times I have added the Chick-fil-A sauce to the sandwich and it made even better!!! The food is really good for a fast food place, but what makes this place a five star is the service. Maybe it is just for the \"grand opening\", but every visit has had exceptional service. They really go above and beyond to make sure you have your food quickly, that the restaurant is clean, and they quickly react whenever a request is made. I went with my grandson and they got him a highchair, cleaned the already clean table, and placed a plastic placemat (with sticky tape sides, so it doesn't pull up) down for him to eat off of. Mind you this was done without me asking for a thing. They just did it because......and they did it smiling and asking can I get you anything? They really seem happy to working here and serving people. If you are like me and have lived in Vegas for a long time you know that at any and all fast food places, this is a phenomenon.",

This is a big deal because he's a young man with a big heart and pays attention to his customers. I even suggested he can take the next customer while I look over the menu. I was his customer. I just want to thank Fredrick and his supporting staff. I made it home safely and my blood pressure was pretty low. My daughter thanks Fredrick as well.

Vegas is a good foodies community and every time a highly-publicized chain restaurant (ex. Cracker Barrel and Chick-fil-A) comes into town, there are lines.   It's just franchised food, so my rating is based on my experiences with other CFA out-of-state locations (including one in Atlanta).  The building is new, clean and attractive, service was efficient, and our original chick-fil-A sandwiches were steaming hot with a large, tender piece of chicken.   The drive-thru has two lanes with state of the art monitors. The line moved well enough and service was efficient (in fact, get your order ready before approaching the speaker because they do prompt you to quickly order to move that line along). Also, there is now adequate parking for diners who want to go into the dining room, but the development is still unfinished so that could change when the other businesses open.",

    "text": "This is the best CFA location in Vegas. Manager Josh is always very friendly, and the food is always consistent. I end up going to the Lake Meade location slightly more often because it is closer to my office, but this location is just a little bit better in just about every way. I ordered off the mobile app (red status) and I got some fries that were a little too crispy. No big deal, I just swapped them out with an employee there. Without even asking, they credited my account with a free sandwich to say sorry. Obviously CFA is a problematic company given their horrible stance on equal rights, but I can't argue with the food or the service. Just donate some money to pride causes to counteract the guilt I guess.",

My favorite breakfast is the bagel with the famous sauce. I just wish the bagel wouldn't fall apart halfway through eating it!   I love the seasonal peach milkshake. It's so good and so worth the splurge.   I just wish this location was open on Sunday!!!",

    "text": "Awesome first impression for me and the boys this afternoon!  Although it was about a 30min drive into town amidst traffic before a three-day weekend, it was surely worth it!  Arrived at 4pm and pulled into their not-so busy covered drive-thru. With only two cars in front of me, and another moving lane beside, I was greeted by a young gentlemen who was patient enough to have me review the menu, ask questions, and then take my order.  I decided on the ever so popular #1 deluxe!  And boy was I happy.  The boys got the same too, with milkshakes.  From placing my order to charging my card...then pulling up to a young lady at a podium station waiting with my printed receipt... and then off to the pick-up window with my food being packed - - - now that's personal & friendly service with smiles!  And because I inquired, I was also given one of each specialty sauces they offer to try on my own!  Who would have known my waffle fries wouldn't last long for my drive home (next time I'm getting an extra order of fries!) they are truly tasty and delicious - just like them chicken sandwiches!!  Their chicken is battered and fried, but yet moist and juicy. The fresh lettuce and tomatoes PLUS the pickles compliment the flavor (and I'm not even a pickle person). But I topped off my sandwich with their house sauce and ... MMMMMmmmm!  I'm definitely going back soon!",

One time I was waiting for my hubby to meet me for dinner and a staff member came up to me and asked me if I wanted anything to drink. I lovvveee the spicy deluxe sandwich and the cookies and cream milkshake. Their breakfast options are also great. The ice coffee isn't all that but its good.

    "text": "It's about effing time! Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas, Chick-fil-A! I have been by several times since opening and will no doubt be back several times more. The staff here go above and beyond to make sure your experience is excellent and I have been inside, in the drive-thru as well placed mobile orders and each time my food has been consistent and I've never had to wait long. I mostly always place mobile orders since it's just easier and you can still redeem rewards including calendar rewards with mobile ordering with very little if any wait when you arrive to get your order.   Chick-n-Minis ($3.15) - Why oh why do you only get an option for 4 count?!?! I'd really like at least an extra mini, so a 5 count would be great. Maybe one day we will get the option of how many per order just like with the nuggets. The minis are Chick-fil-A Nuggets on a mini yeast roll that is brushed with honey butter. This is my absolute favorite thing to eat here! Good by themselves or dipped in your favorite CFA sauce. Only available at breakfast time.   Hash Browns ($1.09) - I had to start ordering myself and hubby our own orders of hash browns because one order simply will not do lol. These crispy and tasty gems are addicting! I open up the box that they come in and it looks like a lot, but before I know it the box is empty and I have eaten them all because they are just yummy.  Chick-Fil-A Deluxe Sandwich ($4.05) - This chicken sandwich has lettuce, tomato, dill pickle chips and American cheese on a butter toasted bun. It doesn't come with mayo or any type of sauce, so you'll need to ask for mayo on the side or one of your favorite CFA dipping sauces. I personally like extra mayo on mine and it comes in packets here which I like because then I can add the amount I want. This is a very tasty sandwich and filling.   Waffle Fries ($1.99 for a large) - These are hot, crisp and tasty. I prefer to eat these right when getting them rather then taking them home to eat because they loose the crisp factor and get softer as the waffle fries sit in the bag during the car ride home. While good by themselves, dipping sauces make the perfect paring for these waffle beauties. The dipping sauces come in a variety of flavors and they'll add any of them to your order at no charge. You can however purchase larger take home tubs if that's your thing.   The drive-thru has 2 lanes and they always have several people out there keeping it moving along. They offer catering. Eat Mor Chikin.",

Went with chicken strips and waffle fries.   The chicken strips were moist and juicy. The waffle fries were crisp and tasty.   Most of the time when a place like this is hyped as being really good what people mean is that it's really good for an inexpensive fast food restaurant.   In-N-Out is the best example of this.   People go there for the first time expecting a world class burger.   What they get is a really good fast food burger that's better than anything else in that price range.   Chick-fil-A is different.   Chick-fil-A chicken can go head to head best overpriced \"as seen on the Food Network\" chicken restaurant out there.    I want to thank my overly zealous political friends on the left and right for clogging my Facebook feed about this place for past 5 years.   I should have tried it sooner!",

The counter staff was very courteous,  very good at their job and very pleasant. As this was our first time eating inside a Chic fil a,  the staff and manager that was overseeing them explained that we could take a seat. They would gladly bring our food to the table. Refreshing. We were asked if they could refill our drinks, which they did to my surprise. They also came and asked how everything was. The store was very clean as was the restroom. The food was fantastic, as all members of my family could attest. I couldn't have had a better fast food experience that didn't feel like a fast food experience.",

    "text": "Waited a few months to let the hype settle down around Chick-fil-A finally making it way to Las Vegas/Henderson. Chick-fil-A is one of my coveted pit-stops on road trips to California, and I was excited to finally have a location closer by. Last Tuesday the craving could no longer be subsided, and we headed to Chik-fil-A!  We live about 25 minutes from Chik-fil-A, and wanted to take the food with us to-go. I instantly became weary when we noticed the drive through line, but was shocked when I noticed their systematic way of splitting the line into two separate lines for efficiency. This drastically reduced the time we waited in Que, and provided us with extremely efficient and accurate service.   All of the workers are extremely friendly at Chik-fil-A, and their was an excessive amount of workers at this location! (This was great for customer service, but made me wonder when pay-roll day comes around how the business stays so well afloat...)  We ordered two spicy chicken sandwiches extra crispy with extra pickles. The extra pickles and extra crispy touch add the final touches to an already delicious chicken sandwich. The breast is perfectly proportioned to the bun, the pickles are perfectly salted, and the spicy breading is executed to provide even coverage.  We also ordered two sides of waffle potato fries (extra crispy!) and also a chicken salad cup to try. I always get all the dipping sauces (Chik-fil-A, Polynesian, Honey Mustard, Garlic & Herb Ranch, Zesty Buffalo, Barbeque, and Sriracha Sauce), but Honey Mustard is by far my favorite.  The chicken salad cup was very delicious, but was too mayonnaise-based for me to enjoy a whole sandwich of. We munched this on the car ride home while waiting to indulge into our sandwiches/fries. The sandwiches stayed perfectly crispy, and the extra pickles were not forgotten. We popped the waffle fries into our Breville Smart Oven Air (must have appliance) and had the best waffle fries of our lives!   Overall delicious affordable dinner, and up to California Chik-fil-A expectations. Yum!  A",

    "text": "So my husband bought me the spicy chicken meal and the nuggets, I specifically ordered the sweet tea. When he came home my drink was full of just ice and the sweet tea is approximately like 4 sips and no more. They trick their customers who pays so much money to eat and in return they fill your cup with 90% ice and 10% drink. Their nuggets is overcooked and the spicy chicken deluxe is saggy with its pickles. My husband paid almost 20$ for my meal. I don't mind paying so much money for food but the food and drink must be the quality and appropriate amount. Don't go here or any of their restaurants it's NOT WORTH of what you pay for. Spend your money to a really nice fast food or restaurant that will give you what you pay for. It's a waste of money here. I would give it a Zero if I have the option! Look at my picture of all the ice they have in my cup. I promise you it's not from my fridge because the ice make is just from restaurants. So don't question it! I never complain if there's nothing to complain about. I also give compliments to those who exceeds my expectations!",

The line was insane, but they were properly staffed and it moved very fast. Friendly workers, great food, and happy customers!  This doesn't really matter for the rating, but my son LOVED the toy in the happy meal. It was a build your own finger puppet thing and it kept him quiet for a while so it gets an extra thumbs up from me!! The sweet tea could have used some more sugar, but it was still good and I kinda go overboard on my sugar anyway. We will be going back soon.",
