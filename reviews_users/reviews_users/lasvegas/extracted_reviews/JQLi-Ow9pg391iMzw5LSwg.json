My husband and I eat out A LOT and we will never eat here again and we tell everyone we know to avoid this place at all costs.",

Both exceptional and I would say if you are hungry, on a budget or no, hit this place up when you are in Las Vegas. Worth the drive off the strip for sure. Locals need to make a stop by also.

Everything here is made from scratch, and Mary, Darlene, and Martha welcome you by name, like family, even though they are always busy.   This morning I tried the party hash for the first time, and it may be my new favorite. It's a mix of corned beef, roast beef, ham, and chicken hash with sauteed onions, mushrooms, peppers, and jalapenos, served with eggs and 2 sides. I do not enjoy super spicy food, so have been leery of the jalapenos in it. I needn't have been. They added just the right hint of spice. I also topped off the potatoes with homemade spicy ketchup and homemade chipotle sauce. Yum!  My husband had his usual: scrambled eggs with cheese, enormous homemade sausage patty, and 2 sides of grits with cheese. The sausage patty is hamburger-sized, and he loves it (even though he usually prefers links). I often waffle between one or another hash (corned beef, roast beef, lamb, super, duck, or lobster) and the waffle breakfast. I always enjoy whatever I choose, and Mary is always adding new items to the menu. I bring all my friends here, and they love it.",

    "text": "Just finished eating here.  We came here because of all the great reviews but also because we wanted to eat at Egg and I originally but the wait was too long.   2 1/2 stars from us.  When we entered we saw the sign to seat ourselves which was good as the restaurant wasn't crowded.  It took a good 5 minutes before we good tired of waiting for someone to come and hand us our menus so my husband decided to get our own.  After 10 minutes of waiting someone came by yo ask us what we wanted to drink.   After ordering our breakfast it took a good 20 minutes for our food to come out.   What we ordered:  Raspberry cinnamon roll.  Very good.  Came our hot and had a nice chewy consistency.  Me:  Eggs Mary with grits and rye bread.  The food wasn't that hot considering it took so long to come out.  Rye bread was pretty good with their homemade jam but the jam wasn't that gourmet tasting.  Poached eggs were a bit rubbery.  Grits were a bit too thick and clumpy and luke warm.  Bacon was good though.  Son:  Eggs Mary.  They didn't bring out his sourdough toast but we couldn't be bothered to ask them for it.    Husband: Party hash.  I told him that I really wanted to try the hash as everyone on Yelp was raving on about how good it was which is why he ordered this.  Even before trying it or didn't look like anything that spectacular.  My husband said it wasn't that good but I still had to try it.  It was so so.  Not crispy and a bit bland but a lot of filling.  Disappointed as I was looking forward to good hash.   You would think the food would be hot as it took so long to cone out but it wasn't.  When we asked our waitress for the check she forgot about it as I had to ask her again.  Took a while for someone to process our payment even though we paid at the register.   My husband said the whole experience was very tiering.  I agree.    Would we recommend this place to others or come back?  Probably not.  Large portions but not good quality.",

I've a couple places I like to hit for breakfast, but Mary's Hash House is my favorite. It's not slick and fancy, there's no trendy music, nor do I have the choice of 20 different pancake flavors. What it does have is comfy casual good ol' home cooking, and that's usually what I'm in the mood for.   I usually get The Skinny with a side of Super Hash. Darlene and the other server (sorry, can't remember your name!) always bring around a tray of home made jellies to choose from, which I love! Mary, the owner, is often busy in the back doing much of the cooking herself, yet still finds time to come out and ask patrons how they're doing.   Now some people might complain that sometimes it takes a bit longer to get your food. I don't consider this a drawback because to me, this shows that most of the stuff is cooked to order and coming out fresh just for me. That's the way I like it and that's why I keep coming back.",

Sat in the seat facing the kitchen- witnessed our waitress picking (not scratching, digging deep) her nose then reaching for toast and arranging potatoes on a plate. Saw the 2 male cooks pushing each other and playing in the kitchen- swinging bacon around in the air and pushing each other's hats off (so they had to readjust their hats and scratch their faces without washing hands or changing gloves) before making French toast. I saw \"Mary,\" apparently the owner, cooking eggs and wiping her nose/sweaty forehead on the back of her gloved hand- without changing gloves or washing hands. Saw my cottage cheese sitting out for more then half an hour without refrigeration and my husband's fries for more then 20 minutes without light/heat. Waited 15 minutes to let our cashier know (after the other had walked by us waiting at the register- she also ran into my chair really hard and just kept going while trying to serve people, after I spilled my coke from her knocking a leg on my chair- no apology or offer of a free coke, which they only have in bottles for crying out loud) we were leaving to pay for the coke, only to have a hand waved at us and told to just leave. We wanted to pay for the coke but we were so fed up we left. Hour and a half to be subjected to rude waitresses, unsanitary and dangerous food, and then treated like garbage.",

    "text": "My sister suggested this place to us because of their lobster benne's .  I'm a big fan of Benedicts so of course I was eager to try this.  The restaurant is situated in a plaza that doesn't seem populated much.  I actually passed it while trying to find it.  The place is outdated and we literally sat on a folding picnic table since there was 6 of us.  Not sure why they couldn't push 2 four seater tables together.  I ordered the lobster benne with hash browns on the side.  My son had a short stack.  My sister decided to try some salmon dish for the first time with a side of their special white toast.  Apparent their white toast melts in your mouth.  This place also makes their own jams.  The waitress came out with a tray full of the different jams (pineapple, jalapeno, watermelon, apricot, grape and strawberry).  You can try as many as you like.  The food eventually came out and I must say the presentation was visually appealing.  After a few bits in, it seemed to get bland.  I added pepper since I never add salt to my food.. But that didn't solve it. The hollandaise sauce was bland.  I slowly gravitated to the lobster only and left behind the biscuit and sauce.  The hash browns were ordinary.  I did try the white toast with the grape jam and that was delicious.  Overall, it's ok.. Wouldn't drive across town to eat here but would recommend it if you want to try a mom and pop place.",

Between the four of us, we had three different hashes and a monte cristo. Everyone cleaned their plates and was happily stuffed.   The monte cristo was mine, and everyone sampled a bit and agreed it was great! Not too heavy on the batter, and fried just right. I loved the variety of homemade jellies, and the jalapeno jelly made a surprisingly delicious compliment to the monte cristo.   Even the potato salad I got on the side was impressive. I mean, potato salad is potato salad, but I don't know why this one was so good!!  Service was quick and friendly too.  This is going to be our new go-to spot!",

    "text": "After seeing so many fellow Yeeps visit this little restaurant off Sahara and Decatur in the old Circuit City strip mall Cesar Q and I decided to follow suit.  Sadly I've driven past this place a million and one times and did not even know it was there.  So thank you, Yelp!  We were greeted at the door by a lovely and FRIENDLY woman from Columbia.  She handed us 2 menus and said to sit wherever we'd like.  Not sure about the negative reviews about this place saying they were rude. They were nothing but friendly with us.  We looked over the menu and when our waitress could see we were ready she returned.  I ordered the original style corned beef hash and eggs minus green pepper as I don't like green pepper aftertaste.  I had to order toast because I wanted to try the homemade jam/jellies!  So so glad I did!  We ordered our typical water with lemon then I remembered reading that the coffee is great at this place.  We waved our gal down and asked for coffee.  She asked if we wanted it regular or strong!? I order regular and it was great! All the hype is for real, yo!  Soon after she brought a tray by with a huge selection of bomb ass jams/jellies. We tried the mixed berry and the raspberry.  Both were great but the raspberry was awesome!!! The hash was really good but I did feel it  was a bit to greasy for my liking.  The potatoes were crispy and great.  The eggs were light and fluffy.    I'd say we will be back to try something else as the food was quality and the place comfortable.",

Most breakfast places have long waits, but Mary's always seems to be able fit me in with minimum wait; it's truly a hidden treasure. Any of the hashes are great; the potatoes are always crispy and the eggs are perfect. They always bring out a large platter of unique jams and jellies that are made in-house, so I'm always eager to come back and try something I haven't had yet. The decor is very traditional and feels like home. I love this place and see myself coming here for a long time. Totally worth stopping by if you're in the area.",

It's worth noting that if you have any special eating accommodations, ask in detail and clarify first. In our  scenario, \"real\" maple syrup is required for my waffles, and they said they said they had it. But, it was maple flavored corn syrup. The chef came out and gave us another, different meal fortunately.   In summary: very tasty, affordable, great volume, staff are good. If you're super picky, be very specific. This is not a casino restaurant - it's a homey tasty niche in Vegas! Come with homey tasty expectations :)",

I came here right before we were about to leave to go back home, and trust me, I did not want to leave. I ordered the party hash, which really was like a party in my mouth. My cousin ordered a side of the pancakes, which were a stack of crispy-on-the-edges-and-super-fluffy goodness. There was only one server on the floor (it was a weekday) and she was very patient and kind with us as we were having trouble with deciding on what to order. As I went over to the restroom, I noticed a little window that peeked into the kitchen, and I was actually able to recognize Mary back there, cooking! I even saw her ask a couple customers how they really wanted their eggs. That's when you know you're eating fresh, quality homemade breakfast/brunch.",

    "text": "All I can say about Mary's Hash House is \"A go go\" somewhere, anywhere else. The wife and I stopped by, and the place was busy. After reading all the awesome reviews here, we were excited to try it....  And after trying it, I started looking for Gordon Ramsay or Robert Irvine to see if they were there trying to save the place.....  We sat ourselves, and within a minute or two, one of the bus boys came over to get our drink order, and he only made one mistake, so, forgivable. We waited about 15 minutes before our server stopped by to tell us she would be there in a few minutes......Ten minutes later she showed up. (unforgivable)  She took our order, we ordered the roast beef hash and the corned beef hash. One with home fries, the other with hash-browns. The order came with two eggs each. My wife ordered over easy, and I ordered over medium. Hers eggs were perfect, mine, the yolks were nearly hard.  Now let's talk about the potatoes, her hash-browns were not seasoned, were barely cooked, and were very greasy. My home-fries, were abysmal. They were still raw in places, and again, zero seasoning, and lots o grease.  Hash...the raison d'etre for this place...I have one word, disgusting. The roast beef....more like where's the beef? It looked and tasted like overcooked ground beef, not even the good stuff, no flavor other than grease, and again, I point out, over cooked.Where is the seasoning?  The Corned beef, people from the emerald isle would weep over how bad this was. It was DRIED OUT, and it looked and tasted like it was the last of what was left that was scraped together and dumped on a plate. No seasoning, and there was almost no meat in it at all.  At this point, our waitress came back and asked us how everything was and my wife told her it was horrible. Giving credit where credit is due, she did offer us the change to replace the food with something else. Here is where my wife once again proved she is smarter than I, she said no. I ordered a cheese burger. After the debacle with the hash-browns and home-fries, I declined french fries and asked for coleslaw.  About 15 minutes later, my burger arrived. It was cooked as ordered, but there is where the positivism ends. There was ZERO flavor or seasoning on the burger, and it was greasy as hell.The coleslaw was so sweet, I could only eat one bite.  After all was said and done, the only thing they charged me for was the burger and two cups of coffee. So I do give them credit for that, but the food was lousy and we won't be back.  Note: I did not mention the side of fruit my wife ordered that came with bruised strawberries.... Note II: When we arrived and we were waiting for our food, we noticed a lot of people leaving a lot of food behind, before trying to eat, we thought it was because of portion sizes, nope...Portion sizes are ok, food is just bad.",

The grits weren't good, but everything else was pretty tasty. The portions were pretty good for being around $10. Other people in my party ordered pancakes which were pretty good despite not coming with any other sides.   The reason this place received the rating it did is because the service that we received was just terrible. For the place being half full, we expected our food to be ready within 10-12 minutes, which is standard for the industry. Really, cooking the food we ordered shouldn't have taken more than 5-7 minutes, but we did not receive our food until 35 minutes after we placed our order. Our water glasses were never refilled and our waitress never checked up on us while we were waiting for our food.   Overall, it was a disappointing experience. Hoping to find a better breakfast place off the strip next time I'm in Vegas.",

Parking was easy and free in the strip mall lot, and we seated ourselves when we walked in.  We were greeted with menus by our friendly server and coffee (regular or bold!), decaf and waters came out fast.   Our food landed in front of us within 10 minutes of ordering - yay!  Me: Angus Top Sirloin & Eggs ($10.95) - served with cottage cheese and an english muffin (my choice of 2 sides), my steak was perfectly rare next to the scrambled eggs.  This is what I needed!  Friend #1: Corned Beef Hash ($7.95) - served w/hash browns and an english muffin, this potatoey, oniony hash had crispy bits of meat in it.  It was not as meaty as we expected - they could stand to bump up the ratio of meat to potatoes & onions.  Biscuits & Gravy ($7.25) - served w/2 eggs and nicely crisped bacon, these b&gs were yummy!  Still crispy edged yet fluffy under the gravy.  To share: Blueberry Pancakes, short stack ($3.50) - super blueberry-y, not overly sweet, really good!  After the food came out, our efficient server brought a tray of house made jams and jellies for us.  They sparkled like multi-colored gems!  We tried:  Apple Butter - super cinnamony, we all wanted to eat this with a spoon  Pineapple Jam - sticky and chunky, like pie filling, this was tasty but overly sweet.  We loved the casual diner atmosphere, and the food and service made us happy. So yes I'm a fan!",

Anything home made is always better. The portions were nice & big. Our server was very pleasant. It was pretty mellow when we went but I was very pleased. If you are in Vegas and looking for a great breakfast place that will cost you less than $25-30, for two people go here! I believe you won't be let down.

On saturday's I like to eat a hearty meal after hitting the weights in the morning, and I go to Aloha Kitchen in the same plaza. I've seen this place before, but never tried it, but finally I did this past saturday.  I had the traditional corned beef hash, two eggs over easy, and you get two sides. I chose their country potatos and toast. Since I haven't been there before, I guess I made the right choice with their toast because their jelly/jams seem to be their main draw. They have a huge selection that they bring for you to choose from. I had apple butter, rasberry and peach. They were all good!  The corned beef hash looks different, redish and chopped into ultra small bits. I like mine to be a bit meatier, but this was both different and good. I'll try and post a picture of it so you can check it out. My current favorite for corned beef hash is Weiss Deli in Henderson...and it still remains tops.  I like this place and it seems to be family run. A few people came in and mistook it for Hash House A Go Go. It's also next to a Smoke Shop, and some even thought they could score some good hashish in here...they too were wrong (j/k!)",

Hash House a Go Go is another 2 miles up on Sahara, turn right when you start getting the smell of wasted food and rosemary branches from the ridiculously large servings they shovel at you there.  With that out of the way, this place is great.  I'm here almost every Sunday for breakfast.  This is the kind of place I would want to hang out if I lived in a small town.  It's almost out of place in the strip mall, and would seem a lot more at home on Main Street in some city famous for the world's largest collection of rubber bands, or the track team winning the class AA title for the last 4 years running.  None of the glasses, coffee mugs, forks, knives, plates...anything matches.  You can tell it's all a mishmash group of utensils and china that has been picked up when prices are good.  I think it's great.  The food is outstanding.  It's hard to decide many Sundays what the best thing to get is.  I usually stick with the Party Hash, which is a mix of the Corned Beef/Turkey/Roast Beef/something else Hash.  It's by far the best hash I've ever had.  I've been eating it on a regular basis for six years.  When I'm up for something different, the triple decker sandwiches never disappoint.    I won't go line by line of the menu, I'll just say.  I've been coming here forever and have never left disappointed.  Two of my favorites that would suggest to all first timers.  #1: The Sausage Patty.  The Homemade sausage is perfect.  For people like myself that don't enjoy sweets and would much rather follow up a steak dinner with another steak than a piece of chocolate cake, this is as close to heaven as you get.  Even if you just like sausage a little bit, get the sausage.  #2: Homemade Jelly.  She always does something special, but my favorite has been the Sangria Jelly.  At the same time she did Sangria there was a Tequila Sunrise Jelly as well.  Both were awesome, both will be missed.  The basics are always awesome as well, Strawberry is my go to jelly.  I would probably inject it into my vein, given the chance.  Get toast, just to try the jelly.  Short story:  This place is great.  The service is what I would expect out of a diner-like establishment.  Sometimes is gets a little busy with theafter church/baseball tournament crowd.  However, Darlene is always great, and always fun to talk to.  Same with Mary, the owner, always friendly and available to help.  If you're hungry for great breakfast and have an extra $10/head make the trip to the corner of Sahara and Decatur.  You'll be glad you did.",

Greatness! - Homemade Jams and Jellies (especially the Apple-Jalapeno), Biscuits & Gravy w/ Homemade Sausage Patty, Triple Decker Turkey Bacon Sourdough Sandwich Just OK - Party Hash (good with Tabasco and still better than \"Hash House A Go Go\") Never Again -  Lamb Hash, Veggie Hash, Beef Barley Soup (really really bad...probably as good as canned)",

Let me just start off by saying I really tried to give it a shot because the owner was on Chopped, so I assumed it would be a hidden gem. Nope.  Our server was rude, pushy and tried to rush us to order because she \"had a 45 top that was coming in\". Once we were ready to order she rushed through everything, spoke over us, so we kept having to repeat our order, and never have us her full attention. I got the asparagus and Swiss omelette, mediocre at best. It was luke warm and she brought the wrong side dishes. ( White and Sourdough are two completely different styles of bread) The biggest complaint I have however...the hash on my friends plate was the Salmon Hash, which would be fine but she ordered the Super Hash, and in fact hates Salmon. So either they aren't cleaning their flat top or they served the wrong hash. Good thing she isn't allergic right?  The staff is older, which I sometimes prefer, they have a way of making you feel at home.  The entire time I was there I felt uneasy, in everyone's way and inconveniencing my waitress.   The 'As seen on Chopped' sign on the window should be taken down if this is the general expectation here.",

    "text": "We were actually looking for Hash House a go go, but we stumbled across this anyway, and it was great!  Four of my family members stormed into this place and sat right down at a table at 10:30am on a Saturday morning. Those of you who don't understand, this is kickass in itself because 10:30 is when hangovers are waking up last night's drunks, and church is getting out. It's a terrible time to try to find food.....  ANYWAY, we all loaded up on coffee and to my delight of my mother, they offered not only decaf and regular, but also BOLD coffee. Nicely done. Downfall....they do not have actual cream for the coffees, only the non-refrigerated half and halfs.  The coffee was great, and then they brought out a cocktail tray of jellies to try. The jalapeno jelly was my favorite, but they had hoards of variety, and they sell them. I forgot to get some on the way out, but they were worthwhile to buy.  I ordered the party hash. Corned beef, ham, jalapenos, bell peppers, and a ton of other stuff that I drowned in the habanero sauce (that's really sweeter than hot), and it was literally one of the best breakfasts that I've eaten......ever (and I'm a huge breakfast fan and frequenter.)  I'd absolutely love to head here again, and I'm pretty sure that I will next time I'm in town.  Fair warning, you guys only have a few more months until I return, so you'd better fix that creamer issue and find some hotter peppers, or you'll be hearing about it. Thanks for the great meal though!",

My boyfriend and i LOVE IT!!!   the habanero ketchup is to die for it gives everything that great kick and the corned beef has isn't like any other. I went to original pancake house and got the corned beef has there but it was served like in a patty?!?   this place is a cute family owned place and their service isn't bad for one waitress and one busboy. They are relatively attentive considering both times i've been there hasn't been a wait.   okay so this review may be all over the place, but i just can't express how great i think this place is!!!!",

And no, you won't have to take out a second mortgage to eat breakfast or lunch here. Good food is what I'm all about and this place hits the nail on the head.   When in doubt, just go to Hash House (how many times do I have to tell you it's not a go go?). Sometimes you just need a little hash in your life. This place hashes like a professional hasher. Awesome flavor, great texture, and more importantly it feels like your getting a home cooked meal. Hash House is everything a chain restaurant isn't, which is why I like it so much. If you're looking for a basic breakfast they do that exceptionally well. Want something a little fancier like a Monty Cristo? Yep. They do that well. Personally, I'm more of a pancake and egg kind of fella. Mary, the owner, was featured for her pancakes on The Cooking Channel, so she has street cred. I can vouch for those tasty hot cakes, they're off the hook.   Their homemade jams are superb. Generally 10+ choices and usually a few unique flavors.   Hash House is definitely a \"regulars\" joint. Become one, you won't regret it.",

They also make a killer Monte Cristo that is my second go-to. Upon straying from the hash, everything else I've tried has been quite tasty. Don't skip on the sides either.

    "text": "Items selected:  Coffee Biscuit with Housemade Jam (Strawberry, Apple Butter) Monte Cristo Carrot Cake  Part of the local dining scene since 1994, long before San Diego import \"Hash House A Go-Go\" splashed down with gluttonous portions at no less than three separate spots, Mary's Hash House on Decatur had always been a place I intended to go and yet for whatever reason it was not until I realized the owner hailed from my home state of Ohio that I finally committed to an early morning visit, a 6:05 am arrival finding a pair of regulars already present amidst the cozy confines as Mary and one other tended both kitchen and front of house in the most pleasant of manners.  Perhaps the most homey of places I've found since relocating to Sin City with aged wood furniture beneath sturdy tables and papered walls decorated by assorted knick-knacks dotting the two rooms it was with hot coffee, medium or dark, plus a menu of farm fresh favorites that I was greeted and although nearly all of the hashes and griddled favorites sounded good it was to traditional favorites that I turned, the meal kicked off by a rustic slice of carrot cake with tangy cream cheese layered on just that morning as I awaited my main course.  Truly 'home-style' with everything made in-house and to order including breads, jams, and jellies it would be perhaps twenty minutes and three coffee top-offs before my primary plate would arrive but proving the adage that good things come to those who wait it was with stunning results when the Monte Cristo was delivered; a True golden fried version with ham, turkey, and Swiss sealed inside ready to be gilded by maple syrup for a perfect sweet meets savory bite trumping any version of the classic sandwich that I've found in Las Vegas to date - a golden buttermilk biscuit with two of nearly a dozen types of jam offered as an alternative to homefries or potatoes no less impressive and briefly making me long for the Midwest...though certainly not for the February weather.",

And this place, although at a strip mall, has that type of feel with random framed pictures and various bird decorations all around. Service may be a little slow, but the staff is very nice.  There are no kid menus but the servers can rattle the items offered by memory.  We had the homemade cinnamon roll fresh from the oven. Not too sweet and you can taste the cinnamon.  Oatmeal came with warm milk & brown sugar. Simple but satisfying.  The Iced Coffee was tasty as well as their coffee which came in medium or strong. We tried the medium and it was \"ok.\" It had a different aftertaste to it.  They had homemade jellies. Yummy!  The waffles were tasty.  The biscuits and gravy were good but could have used a little more salt.  The bacon was awesome.  We asked for hard boiled eggs but they could only make poached.  Overall, if you want a satisfying breakfast, I would recommend that this place is worth a try.",

    "text": "I went here with my husband on Sunday at about 11am. The place was half empty, which should tell you something. We sat ourselves per the sign and grabbed our own menus. After about five minutes someone finally realizes we exist and the waitress takes our order. She greeted us by saying she was glad we were ready because she had a table of fifteen to get to. Okay... well yeah we're ready, we've been sitting here staring at the tiny menu for five minutes. I order and ask what the hash browns are like. \"They're shredded.\" \"Okay, are they crispy though?\" \"Yeah,\" she says in a huff. My husband orders the waffle special. After a million years, our order comes. My bacon and eggs were okay, not great. The \"crispy\" hash browns were mostly mush and tasted ENTIRELY of grease. Like no other flavor was present than straight up grease. My husband's teaspoon of eggs and two strips of bacon were also mediocre/okay (I gave him a few of my five slices of bacon). However his waffle was flavorless, served with a tiny shot flavorless syrup. I tried his waffle and couldn't even believe how the slightest hint of waffle flavor disappeared within milliseconds and left me chewing on a wet sponge. At some point while we were eating we were surprised by the sudden appearance of our check on the corner of our table. How did it get there? Did it float in on the breeze? Our waitress was nowhere to be seen. Which was too bad for us because we would have liked more napkins, water, and flavorless syrup. Oh well. I finished my meal by eating my toast with some of the jams, the apple butter was probably the best apple butter I've ever had, truly a star of a jam. That is why I gave 1 star to this place. If you come here you should just buy a jar of jam and leave.   Finally, having never heard from our waitress again (someone nearby flagged her down for napkins which of course caused her to spin around and vanish into thin air), I got up and paid with the check that had been delivered to us by a ghost. To my surprise, there was our waitress talking to the cashier! She was passionately bitching about another customer to the cashier who seemed to try to politely ignore her. The cashier was friendly to me but in no way did I feel bad about leaving a minuscule tip to match the service.   Ignore the good reviews! Eat somewhere else if you want to enjoy your breakfast in any way!",

Because they were busy, it took a while for the server to come take our order and it took even longer for the food to come.  I got a typical breakfast with scrabbled eggs, bacon and toast.  The best part of the meal was home made jams.  They bring around a tray of several different selections and let you choose, but you get only one choice.   I got a mixed berry and it reminded me of the jams my grandmother had made, rich in color, berry flavor and texture was just right.  The jams and the price was just about the only thing special here, I would go back, but choose a less busier morning.",

You get what you get. **Ordered**        - $8.95 Party Hash - Corn beef, ham, roasted, beef, chicken in a hash. I had to get a hash since the place is called Hash House, but it wasn't anything special.        - $8.50 Tuna Melt - Probably one of the best tuna melts I've had. The cheese was perfectly melted and the bread was amply buttered. I'm talking AMPLY. I wouldn't be surprised if Paula Deen were in the back. **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice brunch place with a small town feel.",

We got the traditional corned beef hash, the special steak hash, and the party hash.   All 3 hashes were homemade and very delicious. (4 stars):  The steak and tradtional corned beef hash came with 2 eggs any style, hashbrowns or homefries, and toast. the party hash came with scrambled eggs mixed in with the hash and toast.   The best part of the toasts were the homemade jams. They had watermelon, raspberry, strawberry and other flavors.   This spot is great if you like hashes! mary herself even stopped by!",

She gets love for referring a particular chipolte sauce they had and it was very very good. They offer a wide choice of their own home made jellies and jams-as well as other products which was cool.  I realize that the hash dishes were their specialty, which is why they get the love from me Holy Sweet Baby Jesus it was arguably the best hash browns I ever had seriusly WOW !!!.  I will definitely come back and try other things on the menu when I visit Vegas again. I strongly recommend on your first time visiting to try the hash browns it is a MUST !!!",

We wanted something close by, early in the am before the hordes arrived. Mary's is a quiet little secret, between Desert Inn and Sahara on Decatur. The staff are consistently well seasoned servers who know the products and who treat us like long lost family. I had the chicken and waffles which were so light and delicious. Coffee is served in a porcelain mug and is freshly roasted. My husband drools over the raspberry rolls in the case before even ordering his breakfast, and so we had the little container on our table right away, to take home. My husband had the lamb hash, which could be more seasoned, but was good. Iced tea is freshly brewed, and it is not from a powder. You will enjoy their home made jams too.  I think that we will return often when a good, solid, tasty breakfast is required, holiday or not. They also have lunch meals til 2pm.",

In fact at about 10:00 am it was \"seat yourself.\"   Usually don't have hash for breakfast but this is a hash house after all, so why not.  I had the lamb hash and it was pretty good. The menu describes the lamb as \"Cabernet Sauvignon marinated leg of lamb with notes of rosemary,\" which I suppose should make it extra special.  But I guess my palate is too old and not sensitive enough to detect the subtlety of what they advertise.  In my opinion this isn't the kind of place or meal that should be describing or described by \"notes\" of anything. However, the lamb taste was there and the hash was good. My wife had the corned beef hash which she enjoyed but didn't find exceptional.    The service was excellent.  The staff was hustling all the time but our waitress didn't forget us and kept our coffee cups full.  And the coffee she delivered was very good.",

Mary, or whoever the older woman is working there, didn't seem too pleased to have us. We sat down and she watched us from afar for a bit before bringing 4 menus. When she did, she literally said NOTHING- no greeting whatsoever. Waiters usually say, \"Hi, I'm X. I'll be your server for today\" or some variation of that.   But NO words escaped her mouth. I smiled as I took a menu and she didn't even smile back! How welcoming. We waited a bit and one person in my party mentioned how weird they felt in the restaurant, then another agreed and shared how she didn't say a word to us, and then I mentioned my smile to her which didn't get a return smile. We all looked around at how empty the place was and all agreed we should just leave. Our money didn't seem welcomed there at all. It had a very weird unwelcoming prejudice feeling there.  We then went to Egg & I which was very crowded. We happily waited the 25-minute wait and enjoyed a very pleasant waiter, meal, and experience.",

The food was good, but nothing really stood out as great.  They offer cooked grits on the menu.  I give them kudos for that as it is not a standard on breakfast menus in this city.  But the grits were not to my satisfaction even after adding salt and butter/margarine (I think they gave me a side of margarine; it didn't taste like butter).  There was one lady working the entire restaurant and there were about a dozen different tables to attend to.  Despite that, she worked frantically to keep up the pace.  She did great.  I just hope that's not the norm for her sake. She brings a silver tray of small plastic cups containing different samples of their jelly and jams.  The tray is kept in a refrigerated cooler by the register.  They sell their brand of jellies and jams from what I saw on a shelf, again, by the register.  It's a quaint breakfast joint and a nice alternative to a franchise breakfast restaurant.  Note:  As we were getting ready to leave, I noticed a lot of dust and dirt build up on the ceiling fan blades, the a/c filter return register inlet as well as the a/c outlet registers.  Hoping that's not the norm.  In the women's bathroom there is also some visual signs of wear that could do with some attention.  It reminded me of visiting a Grandparent's house.  Meaning that the decor is dated, there is visible signs of wear on the building, but there is a sense of calmness and warmth from the people inside, and the food is good.",

    "text": "I am willing to change my review ONLY if I get a decent response from Mary regarding my complaint on CUSTOMER SERVICE. I have spent time reading other reviews AND hearing local feedback, and there's a problem with one of the servers (I will not say her name publicly). She is not friendly, and frankly comes across rude. I waited 30 minutes while watching other people place their orders, get served, and leave before I had to practically wave her down to order. I ordered a breakfast that clearly states it comes with home-fries and toast. I asked her to add a side of grits to the order- let me repeat, ADD, as in pay the additional $2.50 for grits. When I got my meal, there was no toast, so I asked, and she said word-for-word, \"No, you get 2 sides, and you chose potatoes and grits\" then put my ticket down and walked away. I was charged for the grits on top of the original order of $9.95 which makes no sense. It wasn't a substitution, but an ADD-ON. I feel ripped off despite the measly amount of $2.50 because of her attitude.   Now let me tell you the kind of person I am: I have over 10 years in Store/Area Management experience, and I would NEVER tolerate this kind of employee behavior. That being said, I am a firm  believer in SOLVING the PROBLEM through leadership and positive coaching with \"under-par\" employee performance. I have GOOD FAITH (especially in small businesses), that this company will give this employee guidance and support to be better at her job. Because of this, I still tipped her 15%, and pray that whatever's contributing to her negative personality goes away, and she finds inner peace and in turn, starts exerting positive energy.   Again, this review is not reported upon just my experience, but other reviews, and word of mouth by other Las Vegas locals. Mary, I hope you respond to me- even if only for the reason to not only change my review and come back in good faith, but make an effort to say great things about your restaurant and the people that are a part of it. I trust that good food starts with good people.",

I came here with the expectation that this place had enormous portions. When the food came, I was a bit disappointed in the size.   The food itself is not bad. I got the CHICKEN HASH and it was pretty good. It came with two eggs and I got to choose two sides. I got the toast and fresh fruit with it. The fruit was strawberries and bananas.   They have a variety of homemade jams and jellys. I tried the watermelon, apple jalepeno and peach. The peach jam was delicious!! There were real chunks of fresh fruit in there. The watermelon was a bit too sweet, tasted like a watermelon  jolly rancher. The apple jalepeno was interesting, but it was good. There wasn't much spice to it, but it was balanced pretty well.   Service was good. A lot of locals come here, and the servers all knew them well. Overall, this place is a decent breakfast place.",

The counter was full of people watching the tv, the front room was busy and since we had a party of 7, we had no choice but to go to the adjacent room.  DISGUSTING...we walked into the room and noticed a man sitting at a table and no one else; and that could be because all the tables in that room were dirty except for two tables that we managed to move together to accommodate our party of 7.  I looked at the clock and it was 9:50 when we sat down.  My son asked if he could stand by the doorway to watch tv, so I let him.  10:10, no one has come to our table to take our order.  However, the one server did manage to yell at my child when she came into the room to delivery the food to the one man that was sitting at the table next to us.  Again, she walked out of the room without acknowledging us...taking our order or apologizing to my child.  So this restaurant has been here for 20 years?  Really???  Then maybe in those 20 years the owners of this restaurant would have learned that you NEED more than one server and perhaps hire someone to clean the tables as customers leave.    You do know that is a health violation right????    Your food might be \"Good\" but please, its not that good to where people are going to put up with the bullshit attitude of your server and the disgusting conditions of your restaurant.",

Once you set your sights on the place, get ready to grub. The food is great and the portions are generous. It's a more laid back atmosphere and the service isn't speedy quick, so don't plan on a quick in and out. I got chicken fried steak and eggs with home fries and savored every bite. I was able to subsitute a pancake (she brought me two) for the toast. One of the best hotcakes I've had in Vegas. Not to be confused with the \"a go-go\", this place is unique unto itself, featuring homemade jellies. I was a little confused by the Christmas coffee mugs in September, though, and one of my co-workers was a little surprised when they cleaned the table and wiped it off right into his lap. Not quite sure what happened there, but it was good for a laugh and not bad enough to keep us from coming back.",

They tend to sit in the main dining area, watch FOX News, and participate in friendly chit chat.  The food is hearty and the array of homemade jams are enticing. My experience was middle of the road. The Roasted Turkey and Avocado Omelet was fluffy and filled with chunks of white meat. Sandwiched in the fold was a white cheese. I am not sure what it was, probably Swiss because it was mild. Besides the two ingredients listed above, three slices of avocado adorned the top. Other than that, it was a bare of anything else. This observation is not a criticism. It is more of a complement, the omelet needed nothing else. Due to how juicy and well seasoned the poultry was the egg dish did not fall flat. All omelets and hash dishes come with two side dishes. Healthy options include cottage cheese and fruit. I got the grits and wheat toast. The former was magnificent with a little butter. The latter had way too much butter. I wish I knew so I could order it dry. The ample amounts of butter made the toast soggy. The two jams I tried were ok. The mixed berry was loose and runny. The sangria just does not translate well to jelly.  I sat in the quiet back room and dined alone. My choice to be by myself meant I didn't get checked up on and the check was dropped with my food.",

Asparagus/mushrooms/onions/peppers/potatoes possibly zucchini too (cant remember) all under two eggs any style (I went over-easy) with a side of toast. Topped it off with house made chipotle & habanero sauces for a subtle flavor boost that worked well with breakfast. Oh, and definitely get the homemade dill rye if you're a fan of rye bread. I chose the apple jalapeno jam and it was a surprisingly delicious combo. In-house (notice a trend here?) cinnamon rolls and carrot cakes are also available. Coffee is good, they have several creamer options (caramel/vanilla/Irish creme), and the prices are very reasonable. Martha, our waitress, made sure we were never wanted for anything. Great job!

The owner, Mary, was right there cooking breakfast for the customers, making delicious feshly baked biscuits and phenomenal, unique hash style eggs.   The server was very fast and helpful and the place is cosy and clean. When i went it was not busy but i cant  imagine how they deal when they're slammef. I highly recommend this place for breakfast and it looks like they have an awesome american lunch menu.",

Not to be confused with HAGG, up the road, this place actually has good food and service.  Besides the hashes (just get the party hash that combines everything, watch out for the jalapenos, and you're good to go), there are omelets and my favorite dish, Mary's Eggs- which is Mary's take on eggs benedict. Two poached eggs on biscuits, topped with gravy and the best crispy bacon  you've ever had. Everything is sided with homemade grits (simply perfect with butter) and a bowl of fresh fruit.  Their lunch options include soups, salads, and sandwiches. Monday's cream of mushroom is my personal favorite, but they're actually all pretty solid. Only open til 2PM, so run in and grab your order to go if you need to.",

I really wanted a waffle, thinking I would just be smart and order extra syrup, I could flag someone down for coffee, so I went in.  I found a seat by the window, there were TWO other tables seated. The great haired (uh oh) waitress came over and Hi. I ordered a waffle, and coffee, she asked strong and I said strong. Ordered extra butter, syrup, creamer.  She left and an older couple sat themselves, then 5 people came in and went to the back. My waffle arrived.... Wait, what? Less than five min? As she sat it down she said, and I quote \"I thought I'd get it to you before I lose it. I HATE BIG GROUPS.\" Um... Sorry? She then told the older couple all about it, all about it. In detail.   I couldn't get more coffee, because after a pass through early on the owner was in back. No other people.  I are my Uneventful Waffle with Amazingly Taste Free Syrup, and she brought the bill. They stand there, with a little machine they hand you, and stare as you put the tip amount in. Then give you the receipt. I'm pretty sure of myself most times but it was creepy.  The parking lot was really big. I guess that brings it up to two stars.",

    "text": "So I read a few reviews before deciding to come here. A fan of chopped I figure it'd be worth a try. As we entered on Friday at 1pm, we were surprised by the lack of crowd. Three table of patrons.  We read the sign after dumbly standing there for a minute or two without anyone greeting us and we seated ourselves. Looking around we saw many tables with dishes not bused. We sat. And sat. And sat. No one came to greet us. The one and only server finally came and took order from a nearby table. Did not acknowledge us. We are a table of 7... Luckily I had time on my hands so I read more reviews. On one of them a reviewer mentioned \"the egg and I\"  nearby. We walked out without a goodbye.  We were famished. Luckily the egg and I seemed close by. Keep in mind this was a spur of the moment decision. Triggered by the lack of service at our original destination. We arrive at egg and was greeted by a smiley hostess. The place was crowded. We informed her we wouldn't mind two tables of four. She smiled and said she has just the space for us. They pushed two tables together and made us a space by the booths.  Service was prompt. Our waitress introduced herself as Jackie. The food was delicious.  bottom line is the reviews seem to give the food good remarks. However we were turned off by the lack of service and never made it to the food part.  Even if the food was five star worthy, the overall experience would have netted 3 stars at best. Being a small business owner myself, my constructive criticism for the owner would be to over staff part timers so short staffing does not ruin the reputation of the establishment. The difference at your competitor was night and day. As a result we are a loyal egg and I customer at the moment",

The chicken fried steak is out of this world, crust is light and fluffy streak wasn't tough at all and the home fries with onions and peppers is sooo flavorful, and let's not forget the homemade jellies that's right I said HOMEMADE JELLYS after getting your food the server bring around a try of assorted jellies and ALL of them are amazing.

They had vanilla, hazelnut and half and half creamers in the bowl she brought. On our way out I saw the display of the different jams for sale and without question i bought the apple butter. Came in a small mason jar maybe 8 ounces for $8, pretty expensive and I never spend that much on jams so you know it was good :) Apparently the owner Mary was on the tv show chopped the night before which I was unaware about. very cool though, will definitely be back and become a regular with the extra treatment haha",

    "text": "Not to be confused with \"Hash House A-Go-Go.\" The Hash House is that typical off the strip Vegas dilemma. The restaurant is an unsuspecting caught in the middle of a strip mall location.   The service is great, friendly and fast as I think the people who work there own it. The decor is almost random I guess this is some sort of Midwest motif? Even the plates don't match the cups and that's cool.  The bottom line is the food is so good. As the name indicates it's all about their Hash. Before this visit I wasn't aware of how many varieties of hash there are. The Hash is the specialty and it's authentic. Not like the stuff I'm used to- from the can.  The Ingredients are super fresh and you get the sense that it's made from scratch per your order. This goes for everything from the coffee to the bacon as well.   Don't sleep on this place, because it closes at 2:00 PM... Get it don't sleep...Breakfast... Don't sleep, Um? Forget it... Hash House will be one of your favorite Breakfast spots.",

    "text": "Mary's hash house, not to be confused with hash house a go go, is terrible.  This place has the worst service I've ever seen.   I would love to tell you our servers name but she never said hello or introduced herself, she just said \"drinks?\"  We ordered two iced tea. About 10 minute minutes later she came over, put our drinks down in front of us and just looked at us with a pen and pad.  No suggestions, no \"what are you having,\" she just looked us.  I had to ask her if she was ready, to which she responded with a shrug, as if I was wasting her time.  Mind you there where only 3 other tables with people at them in the whole place.  I should have know at that point that a breakfast joint with 6 other people in it on a Saturday morning was not the place to be.  Food took about 10 minutes, the check was dropped with the food and the server never returned.  We sat there with empty glasses for the rest of the meal.  I had the corned beef hash, my friend had the roast beef hash.  Both were ok, not great by any means but not bad either.  I read a few other reviews that said the hash was great compared to the canned stuff they are used to.  That right there should tell you everything you need to know about the food.  Back to service, the next time I saw our server she went up to the bar counter where they had what looked like cinnamon buns in glass presentation cases.  She opened up the glass presentation cases, and squeezed the buns with her bare hands to check the freshness.  Well I would say after that I had enough.  I wanted to try the \"homemade deserts\" but no one ever came back to check on us or to see if we needed anything else.  Also, after seeing how the handle the food out front where everyone can see imagine what's going on behind closed doors in the kitchen. I took our check to the unattended register, and stood waiting for someone to show up and cash me out, I should have just left, but being a bartender here l in town I wouldn't do that.  Our server showed up to cash me out, and just like at the table 30 minutes earlier she never said a word.  Not a \"how was everything,\" not a \"thank you,\" no \"come back again,\" nothing.  So I can assure you I will never return Mary's hash house!!!",

I decided to go with the cornbeef hash.  It was really boring, not too bad of taste but just not very memorable and I think it may have been sitting.  The service is excellent and I did see they have fried chicken and waffles yummy, which is what I am going to try next time.  I liked it here, but I think I'll like it more once I order something that really gets my eye.  I recomend it but stay away from the corned beef hash, not nasty but just not worth it.",

As the restaurant name suggests, they have a lot of hashes to choose from. I went with the salmon hash with a side of home fries and fruit. It was tasty but I think it could have been seasoned a little better. I eat a lot of 'clean' meals and so I crave good seasoning when I eat more traditionally.   The hash didn't sit on my stomach really heavy like they typically do so I really appreciated that. They have a bunch of different jellies to try which was kinda cool. I was boring and went with grape vs. a fancier selection.   I wasn't absolutely crazy about it but I'd go back and give something else a try.",

    "text": "The overwhelming amount of options your search engine provides for \"breakfast\" can only be navigated by the star-labeled risk of others before you. And breakfast, coming from a restaurant defended by four stars, as simple and innocent as eggs with meat and potatoes can be, should be at least somewhat tolerable.   This was mostly the opposite.   In fact, bringing my mother-in-law here was nothing short of embarrassing.   Biscuits and gravy for her, the lamb hash for me, and country friend steak for my fiance.   To begin, the service was horrible. An older woman with poofy grey hair, stone-faced and without consideration. She clearly did not have time to even consider listing the sides, and rather told me to just read them. Fair, as they were listed in the menu. So, we move forward.  A sigh as we order coffee and orange juice, an explanation of the hash browns that did not answer my mother-in-law' s question, and really just a general impatience.   It takes 20 minutes for food, which does not bother us at all. This seems standard for good breakfast.   But what comes out is disappointing.   Lamb hash was bland. It tasted like dry, overcooked beef and potatoes. I would have never known that I'd ordered lamb, as the edges of each tiny bit were curling and on the verge of burnt.   Biscuits and gravy were alright. Gravy was watery and without decent consistency or flavor. Comparable to packaged.   Chicken fried steak was good. Moist, crispy, everything it should be. Topped with bland gravy.   The fruit bowl was nice. Toast seemed refrigerated and ice cold.   Jelly was awful. Ordered the most simple strawberry. Flavor was that of a jello packet maybe. Possibly worse.",

Mary's does not disappoint in the diversity of menu, savory homemade dishes, and home style feel.   Ms. Martha completely rocked the entire restaurant as the only server and dazzled us with the wide assortment of seasonal, housemate jams. The apple jalapeno, pumpkin butter, plum, raspberry, and strawberry jams were all excellent. How blessed am I to have been with a group for a wonderful sampling?!?  And the apple butter.  What! Not an accurate description- more like Apple Pie Preserves. So good I bought a jar to fly back to Michigan with me.   I had the salmon hash, others rounded the table off with meatloaf hash, party hash and the tri tip hash. Even the traditional bacon and eggs breakfast looked amazing!   I carried out a large slab of Mary's carrot cake to eat on later.   Every future trip to Vegas will have at least one stop to this gem!",

    "text": "Live nearby and saw this place a few weeks ago, made a mental note to go in for breakfast sometime. Went in on a friday around 11am. There were good parts and bad parts. Place was definitely not crowded, which was nice. Definitely seems like a 'regulars' place. Literally when I came in, everyone, staff and customer, stopped what they were doing and looked up at me in the door, twilight zone-y. Also almost everyone was having legitimate personal conversations with the waitress. Kind of offputting, made me definitely feel like I was in the wrong town, just a weird vibe. Not relating to the food but it was noticeable. Anyways I sat down and looked over the menu but the waitress told me about their tri-tip hash special which looked about as good as anything else on the menu so I tried it. The steak was flavored nicely, but a tad tough. Eggs were good, hashbrowns were mushy like they were boiled. Ordered a coke and actually loved that it was brought in an old fashion tall glass bottle. You never see that anymore! I did enjoy the ambiance of the place, very chill country diner-esque which I always like to find. Having signs like \"NO we DONT have wifi, talk to each other, pretend it's the 90s!\" is awesome. Plus if it's your thing, they have a bakery right there so, heck yeah. All in all I'd love to stop by again and try it again.",

    "text": "So my friend wanted to come to this place because it the chef was on Food Networks' Chopped.  Sure, breakfast.  What can go wrong?  This is clearly a locals place, but I have to wonder, has this place gone downhill since being on tv?  We went on a Saturday, a bit after the brunch rush, it wasn't even lunch time yet.  They were not busy, and it was \"seat yourself\"  A server came pretty quickly to take our order, but man did we wait FOREVER for our food.  It was 30 minutes (no exaggeration, I timed it) after she took our order, and we were STILL waiting for our food.  We looked around, first off they were NOT busy, the place was not full, but there were people that were already seated before us that were also still waiting for their food.  We also never saw our server again.  No one came to check in on us, no one came to check on drinks, or to tell us sorry it's taking so long, but the food is on it's way.  We didn't order anything complicated, a Ham hash and a corned beef hash.  That's it, we didn't even substitute anything.  Seriously - all this stuff should have been prepped and ready to just throw together.  I don't know what they were doing in the kitchen but come on, this was completely unacceptable.   The food at least came out piping hot, so at least we had that. I'm only giving it 2 stars because the food was decent, but nothing to write home about.  It wasn't too bad for the price, but when Egg and I is not too far away, I will never come here again.",

I'm gonna make my reasons short & sweet: depressing & gloomy atmosphere, no garlic in my chicken garlic hash, chipped water glass & last but not the least the food server who was neither friendly nor attentive. She never smiled, checked on my table, dropped the check with food & disappeared. The price was ok as well as quality of the food. In a city like Vegas with thousands of dining options, one would think small businesses like that go beyond their way to make costumes enjoy their experience. It one sentence, felt like dining at a truck stop in the middle of nowhere with a grumpy server who hates her job.",

We decided to give it a shot since we were all starving, initially I regretted the decision because it took forver for our order to be taken and the food to come, but once it did it was SO delicious and fresh! I really liked that if what you wanted was not already a combo on the menu they were willing to create a combo for you (i.e. instead of the 4 pancakes by themselves you could get 2 with whatever side). The waitress was really nice and continued to check on us throughout the meal. Everyone was pleased with their meal and while the portion size was not as large as HHGG the quality was much better.",

We were greeted by the owner Mary who had a big smile on her face while carrying out a fresh batch of Cinnamon Rolls.  I ordered their holiday special S'mores Coffee and blueberry Oatmeal-which was actually blueberry flavored Oatmeal!  Their menu had a huge selection of Hashes, homemade low carb bread, pumpkin french toast, stuffed meatloaf ect....OMG!  EVERYTHING is homemade-even their Jellies, which they bring out in 20+ different flavors on a sterling silver platter to you.  Seems that all the servers have worked here 10+ years, which doesn't surprise me since the feeling of family really resonates here.  Super excited to be a regular returning customer and happy I found a True home style meal in Vegas!",

Wasn't expecting a mid west style diner, when we walked in, the first thing I noticed was a giant big screen tv hanging over the bar replaying CNN or Fox (I can't even remember what it was, as I can't stand watching either) and a couple old dudes hanging around watching it. We seat ourselves, and we are roughly \"greeted\" by a woman and before I can finish my sentence of ordering coffee, she has already left our table. We noticed right away she was the only one serving the entire restaurant. So she comes back to finish our order, and before two words can get out of my mouth, she leaves to go answer the telephone.   We finally place our order, San Diego Omelet with a side of grits and Monte Cristo with Sweet Potato fries. They both come out, they look decent, but one bite into the Monte Cristo and I was done, it was disgusting. Inedible and I don't know how but my fries were sour. I never leave a fry untouched. Never. I couldn't eat them. The San Diego Omelet was nothing special. The only thing this place has going for them is they don't use instant grits.",

Not the case here at Hash House. It is delicious.   My favorite dish is the biscuits and gravy. Does not disappointment any time at all.   The serving size to price ratio is great.   I often go for their lemonade with a watermelon slice garnish.   Everything is good. Everything is worth the try.   Service is usually pretty good here, but please mind that since they are so loved by the community... there may be wait between service. It's not outrageous, so bring good company, good read and you're set to start you're day just right!",

First, let me start by saying that this will not be my typical, critical review but hey I am a critical person (that's why i Yelp for Help, lol).   Anyhow, at first I was stuck between the choice of the salmon hash and the lobster and spinach omelet. I asked the waitress which one was better and she told me that she prefers the hash. Maybe, i shoulda went with my gut (especially because I was starving), but i heeded her advice and was severely disappointed. My salmon hash was chunks of salmon fillet spread over home fries. Maybe I was expecting something different but I was not too happy with the meal.  After notifying the waitress, i switched to the lobster and spinach omelet, which was like a party in my belly! It was delicious!!! I enjoyed my meal and would def return, but next time im not asking for advice!",

I get the eggs sunny side up, and sides of fruit and either grits or toast.  I especially enjoy the apple jalapeno jelly on the sourdough toast.  Multiple hash options, waffles, pancakes, biscuits and gravy - they have something for everyone.  It is not the fanciest place in town, and I like that.  Tucked away in a strip center at Sahara and Decatur.  The service is friendly.  We look forward to every trip here - this is our second day in a row to be here.  Give it a try - I think you will like it!!!",

My wife had the ham hash which was more flavorful than mine. Their homemade sauces were good along with the jellies. My toast was burnt and placed upside down so I wouldn't notice it, the server was spread thin so we didn't get the attention we were expecting. When it started getting busy the owner Mary came out and helped tend to the customers.  If we come back I definitely wont order the chicken unless they start making it more moist. I'll probably try the ham instead.",

We came in on Sunday 8/17 around 11:30am. It was past the breakfast rush and before the lunch rush. I don't know if it was just our server but my goodness the service was TERRIBLE. We seated ourselves as the sign requests. There were MANY empty tables yet the first thing our server told us was how busy it was. We looked around very confused, but whatever maybe they were short staffed. NOPE I counted three servers in a very small restaurant should be plenty.    It took us about 10 mins just to get coffee, which we desperately needed. Once we got the coffee I had to wait another 5 mins for the milk for the coffee. I finally gave up and went to the counter to get the milk. My server appeared to have forgotten. Since we knew this was already off to a bad start we all figured out what we wanted quickly and ordered as soon as we could get our servers attention.   Getting a refill on coffee was literally like pulling teeth. We noticed the two (yes only two) other tables that were occupied commenting on how long it was taking, that they were just going to leave and so on. We were hungry so we stayed. After waiting a significant time one of my friends asked our server if our food would be out soon. Honest to goodness she looked like she either didn't know what we were talking about or was put off by us asking. She replied, \"Oh, I don't know. I will go see.\" I am sorry...what?????  After she \"went to go see\" our food was brought out not 5 mins later. It wasn't super hot so maybe it had been sitting there...I don't know. Anyways, the food was just as good as I remembered. The jams are sooo good. The apple and raspberry jams are amazing. I am super bummed to give the Hash House a bad review, but dang that service was NO GOOD. Get it together guys, great food is well...great, but terrible service can kill a restaurant.",

The server Darlene walked up with a grumpy face and said its self seating, I can't tell where you want to sit\"  We were the only customers there and it was our first time.... she could have asked where we wanted to sit instead of give attitude. The rest of the experience was just like this....   I ordered the veggie hash. I asked what could I substitute the 2 eggs for?   She chuckled, shook her head in frustration and gave a list of sides. I first said grits but then changed my mind and said toast. And she gave attitude that I changed my mind and said pick one more. I kindly asked her to repeat and she GAVE ATTITUDE. I asked if this was the sub for egg??????? She replied \"you said grits\" I said no, I want toast as my side... can I just have avocado instead of egg? \"Sure is that all\" (UGLY and rushing me?)  Then she walks up with tray full of various jellies, (what the they're known for!) She said \"jelly.\" I got excited and said \"OoOo what do we have here she said \"JELLY.\" I didn't like her attitude so I said \"I know you said jelly, but what kind? this is our first time here and you have so many... (jerk!)\"  Maybe she was having a bad day? We're all human and have bad days. But as soon as a regular walked in the door she gave above and beyond service. STRAIGHT DITCHED my grandma and I. A group of 4, 3 white race and 1 black (but acted white). Then the next customer was a white couple and then a white guy. Could be coincidence, that we were the only Hispanics... and received crappy ass service, but we didn't get straws, nor napkins, and served old cold coffee. But her white regulars had special seating, straws without request, a freshly brewed pot of coffee. The owner Mary stepped up and gave much better quality service! But with 7 customers a side from us, Mary shouldn't have had to come out. I'm a server so crappy service really bugs me. We did not tip, on purpose.",

It's a place where your sister meets you when you just had a major disagreement with your mom and you just have to  sort it out while having a cup of coffee and something off the menu or you meet your best friend to share about that date you had last night. I ordered the San Diego omelet it was full of bacon tomatoes and topped off with cut avocados. I also had a side of Grits they where perfect. I also met Mary and actually had a opportunity to have a short conversation. Nice lady and that is what accents this establishment. It makes a difference when the owner or a awesome manager or host is onsite. Great place as Always I like to inform those who visit from time to time or if you're a local and just happen to be on the west side of town. Stop into Mary's Hash House. You will leave with a full stomach and a great smile!",

Darlene has been there for years, she was the first waitress we had there and we loved her, so when we went last week we were excited to see her again. Her dry sense of humor and \"take me as I am\" personality make our visit.  As for the food, I have yet to try something the that I didn't love. The food is just delicious. Last week we ate the three times and I had a different entree every day. The first visit I had one of the specials, Shrimp Eggs Benedict (pictured with review) with grits. If that had been a special offered on another day we visited, I would have had it again. The next visit I had the Monte Cristo. Again, delicious! It wasn't too heavy or greasy. The version here is served with maple syrup instead of the traditional raspberry jelly and I really enjoyed that. My husband's had a bite of mine and ended up ordering it when we went the next time.  On our last visit, I went with another of the daily specials, Fried Cod & Chips. The fish and fries are cooked perfectly and it was served with a nice house made tartar sauce.  If I lived in Las Vegas, I would eat here at least once a week.",

    "text": "This is hands down the best breakfast place I've ever visited! Mary's Hash House has the most delicious corned beef hash on Earth. I've been to Hash House A Go Go and there is no comparison. Mary's food, service, and hospitality far outranks them.  This place is cute, comfortable, and cozy. The jam selection is outrageous and tasty! If I lived closer I'd come all the time.  Perfect start to Easter Sunday...they even give you colored Easter eggs!  I highly recommend Mary's to anyone who is visiting Las Vegas  Adding to this review was totally needed because over the course of two trips, I've come here three times! I can't get enough of Mary's corned beef hash, delicious and fresh, it's still the best I've ever eaten. I wish she'd open a place in the Bay Area...are you reading this, Mary?",

    "text": "I was fortunate enough to try Mary's Hash House on my last trip to Las Vegas.   I wanted both duck hash and corned beef hash for breakfast. The waitress was nice enough to give me duck hash & corned beef hash combo.   Duck hash & corned beef hash: served with choice of two eggs, home fries & toast, both duck and corned beef hash were delicious. The duck hash was slightly crispy. I don't know the price of the combo, but corned beef hash is $9.50 and duck hash is $14.25.   Fresh brewed coffee ($2.50): you have a choice of either bold roast or medium roast. The coffee was not bad.   I loved the mismatched plate and mugs at the restaurant.   Don't forget to try their jelly samples!! They have apple butter, apple jalapeno, watermelon, strawberry and grape.   Hash selections: Corned bef, chicken, ham, roast beef, lobster, turkey, roast lamb salmon, meatloaf, duck, and party (corned beef, ham, roast beef & chicken).  They also serve pancake, waffle, biscuit & gravy, fried chicken & waffle.   Our waitress, Lily, was the best. This social butterfly is sweet, outgoing, quick, attentive, helpful and friendly. We asked for recommendations and she recommended both her favorites and most popular dishes. Thank you!  We even met the famous Mary.  Who is Mary? Mary, the owner of the restaurant, was on Chopped @ Food Network.   Mary's restaurant is a diner type restaurant that serves homemade, delicious food with a twist. It's almost like eating at your aunt's house.   4 stars!! I am a fan!  Mary's Hash House is yummylicious!!",

    "text": "Well I was lucky enough to find another diamond in the rough. Not really the rough but not an easy find based on the location. I'm a breakfast fan, but since moving to Las Vegas I have only found a few breakfast places I really enjoy. After being here 2 years I finally found one in my neighborhood that is as good and truth be told better than other places with similar offerings. First off it's kind of hidden in a set back strip mall at the corner of Decatur and Sahara. (Southwest corner) No huge signs or marketing. It's there if you look but easy to miss unless you know what you're looking for.   Very down to earth diner setting. Pleasant, clean and not the least bit pretentious. Family owned and operated. I've never been in to eat and not seen Mary and / or her sister Therese. They are very welcoming and lead by example. I've yet to see them shirk from performing any task needed. Cooking, cleaning, serving, side-work ect. They never stop and I'm sure that's what has kept the resturant going and kept them so young. The other staff also feels like family. Darleen and Lilly and amazing and on the spot for anything you might need. I've yet to meet the other kitchen staff, but a big window  is set in the facing kitchen wall giving the customers the ability to see all the goings on. Kind of like looking inside the works of a well made watch. As stated prior if things get hectic Mary and Therese jump right in and keep things moving with the rest of the crew.   The food is wonderful, fresh and served with pride. Great breakfast fare but also a good lunch selection. For all that has already been said the prices really can't be beat. You won't find this mix of well run diner magic any place in the area as far as I'm concerned.  With at least 25 years under there belts, Mary and her team have to be doing something right. LOL   P.S. They have a tasty number of homemade jelly selections you should try. Everything is made fresh including the 50lbs of potatoes they peel and prepare each day to meet the needs of her hungry loyal customers.",

Biscuits are not toasted and gravy needed more meat and flavor.  Service is just okay overall but very bad when this one particular old lady is working. She is the reason for every 1 star review. Mary herself helped us once and boy that was special, great stories and just such a nice hard working lady but that is rare. Martha I believe with dark hair did good and was interactive and friendly, refilled and smiled etc.   Refills come late or never on some occasions so glad they got big cups now.    Getting a check is weird, I either get my bill before my food comes and when I wanted to add a cinnamon roll but I don't get my check for 15 minutes after finishing other days. I didn't get extra napkins a few times I needed them.   This place is overrated for sure.",

I think I have found my new favorite place for breakfast in Vegas.   With a placed called HASH HOUSE I had to try one of their specialties.  Pastrami Hash was on the daily special board so that was an easy choice. However all the ingredient combos offered in the house of hash looked delicious.   My food came out quickly from the kitchen.  A very generous portion of chopped pastrami with tricolor peppers, onions, home fries, hatch chilies topped with 3 eggs OE. It was a thing of beauty.  Very tasty hash indeed. The fresh wheat toast was also very good.  Martha came around to offer house made jellies to try. I tried the watermelon and jalapeno and both were excellent.  On your table they also have house made ketchups to top your dish with. My favorites were the Chipotle but the habenro had a nice kick. Next time I will ask for my potatos well done because I like the crunch. Everything is made to order so be patient when it's busy.",

I found myself adding all four of their in-house seasonings to try and bring up the flavor level. As far as I could tell, the ingredients were fresh and cooked perfectly; they just lacked seasoning.  The menu is well rounded- with breakfast and lunch items. I will probably try one more time to see if it was just the corned beef hash.",

In the end, my husband and I ended up buying two jars (one raspberry the other apricot) to take home with us.   There was only 1 waitress there that day. She put most big named restaurants to shame. She was sweet, attentive, and was able to work the whole room (all filled with locals that frequented the place daily).  I will definitely come to eat here again when I am in Las Vegas.",

We actually pulled up the health department rules on our phone to show the server and she seemed very uninterested her biggest concern was the fact that they were closing and 40 minutes as she rushed around through the restaurant attention of her presents was also on bearable. There were about 5 tables in there eating listening to the vacuum cleaner girl as we watched her vacuum right up against tables where people were actually eating at.    You can see the cooks working through the window from the dining room and we watched one of the cooks picking up utensils while making food and a bottle full of mail anyway he had absolutely no gloves I'm neither did the other cook we could see through the window in the back kitchen.  Just seeing a cook preparing food without clothes on health code violation number to then when our server went to get the coffee the sanitizer f*** it was leaning up against the coffee pot switch also was another violation and we said the heck with this place we're out of here as we were leaving one of the servers asked why we told her and all she did was turn around and go in the back kitchen eat at your own risk.",

He ordered a sandwich with fries, the other the San Diego omelette with hash, and myself tuna melt with fries.  When he got back we were all surprised to see that we all didn't get sides!!!! Not one of us.  Now I understand that if it said sides are extra on the menu but no it says \"comes with your choice or sides!!! And to make it even more \"wtf\" my sandwich and my buddies omelette are in one box!!!!! Really \"Mary\"?!?! So I called and \"Mary\" answered it ( the reason I put quotations on this is because she said she was Mary the owner but you never know). So I told her that we didn't get any sides.  She replied that's how we ordered it......yes Mary all 3 of us decided we all don't want sides so that we can keep our figures.....OH NO!!! We are hungry boys working morning till night!!! I told her no we ordered 2 fries and one hash.  Her response was, \"no you didn't\". I also told her that even both my main order and my buddies main order were in the same box. Her response, \"that's how you wanted it\". Yes of course Mary we wanted our food together so that we can recreate the scene from Lady and the Tramp!!!  So then she just cut me short and ask, \"so what do you want\"......Excuse me?!?! I told her well cutting your attitude to a customer would be nice.  To which she replied again, \"that's how you wanted it, so what do you want?\"  After that I asked her for her name and she said, \"Mary, the owner.  Well Mary the owner.  Thank you for no sides even though you gave us a bottle of ketchup!!!! And thank your for your gracious attitude Mary! You remind me of the character \"Mom\" from Futurama.  Look it up Mary.....I will definitely not come here anymore. And will let everyone know about your attitude.  Like I said I don't do reviews unless it's super awesome service, or someone treated me bad.  You fell on that Mary.  Best of luck to you and your business....(also check out my pics on here on how our food was presented along with their menu)",

I like (just not love) the cinnamon roll, 1 will be find for a table of 4. I really like Mary and love her jellies. They bring around a tray with all the different types but beware this is a ploy because you will want to buy a jar to take home. I have bought several and used them at home. I bought the peach jelly and used it over roasted chicken (yummy!). But sorry I have a hard time wanting to continue to go back every time I am in Vegas because of the station they have blaring on the TV. If you won't turn off Fox News please think about turning it to the weather channel.",

Now I get that they were busy, the place wasn't 100% full but I think there was only the 1 waitress that morning so I tried really hard to be understanding. We ordered some hash and eggs, hashbrowns on the side, 1 kid wanted the cinnamon roll only so we also got 2 of those for the table. We waited a whole other 45 minutes to get our food. We ate quickly and left, for good. Just for the wait, no matter how strange or off that day was, no chance at a repeat ever. However the waitress was friendly when she was around, and the kids liked the cinnamon roll better than the ones in the store so.... there's that....",

I can confidently say I am glad we ended up not going to the other breakfast spot. The waitress gave us menus and immediately let us know that they had fresh made cinnamon rolls and only one left. It's almost like she knew about my obsession with these delicious balls of dough. It came out piping hot and melted in my mouth. We ordered the party hash which had chicken, roast beef, ham, and corn beef. We got our hash with over easy eggs, and hash browns and we got some wheat toast as well. Let me tell you.... the hash browns were cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside. The meat in the hash itself blended together perfectly! If you're expecting Smuckers jam for your toast you will be sorely disappointed.... our waitress came with a TRAY of what looked like fresh made jams and we got to choose the flavors we wanted. We got apple butter, sangria and watermelon and omg..... we sat there drooling over these jams. They do have them jarred for sale, but unfortunately this was a cheat meal weekend.   Come here for breakfast! You won't be disappointed.",

I tried the so called \"Party Hash\"... it was basically an egg scramble, not a hash.. it was awful. I didn't eat it. Never got our jam for our toast until after the fact I was ready to pay the bill and get out of that dull place. Never was asked how we were doing. Nothing. After she dropped off the food she left the check on the table. Great... I knew I should've never came here! What a waste of $40! I just knew I should stick to what I know is good. This definitely is not good. Don't do it! Even their cinnamon rolls are yuck! Had a super weird taste to them. Definitely not worth $5 for a cinnamon roll. I would get a better one at a gas station for less! Trust me, don't come here. Everything sucks.",

I am still not really a morning person, but I manage better than I used to. I've been eating a lot more breakfast and have been trying lots of new places. I'd heard about Mary's and added to my list of places to try.  Last weekend my Hubby and I ended up on the other side of town (we live in Henderson) and needed to eat. I am so happy that we decided to stop into Mary's and I really wish this restaurant were either closer or had a location in Henderson!  It's exactly like all of my favorite places - small and welcoming. Nothing fancy - no hostess, a \"seat yourself\" sign. Even though it was Sunday morning, it wasn't crowded. Some folks would take this as a bad sign, but not me. This is a hidden gem, tucked away in a strip mall, just around the corner from Hash House a Go Go (which was packed). Many people in this city tend to overlook to wonderful family owned places, which is unfortunate.  Now, to the food. I LOVE corned beef hash, but I rarely order it at other restaurants because I feel like it is always super dry. Well, if hash is in your name, I am going to try it. And we weren't disappointed! We both ordered the standard corned beef hash and it was really good - not dry at all, super flavorful. Our service was fantastic and friendly, we also really loved the homemade jams and jellies that were offered - there were so many to choose from!!   We will definitely be back. The prices were reasonable, the food and service was great (Mary even stopped by to check on us!) and the portions were a good size. I just wish it were closer to home!",

They make their own jam too (yes you can sample it) and the toast is amazing (trust me). Waffle was perfect! Crispy on on the outside and moist on the inside (Perfection!!!) This is a Family owned business and everyone is very personable!! This is definitely where we are going again!!",

I love when the server knows the menu well and can make recommendations. Jen was definitely that! Can't wait to go back and check out their lunch menu too!!",

    "text": "This is a hidden breakfast gem! Visitors should absolutely take advantage of the multitude of homemade jellies that they serve, from jalapeno apple butter to mixed berry and pear, the jellies are delicious and worth the visit on their own. I went with a group of friends for breakfast, and I think what I liked best about the food was the reasonable portion sizes packed with plenty of flavor. I was not overwhelmed by the amount of food, my three egg omelette was perfectly sized.  The toppings and veggies were plentiful, so you didn't feel like you were getting too much egg or too much veggies and meats My only complaint, which did not stop it from being a five-star experience, was that the omelette mix was a little salty for my liking, however I'm sensitive to salt so most people would probably love it. The servers were friendly and attentive! The owner, Mary, distinctive in her black chefs uniform and hat, often comes out and says hello to the tables and is always a delight to engage with. The food prices are more than reasonable the coffee is hot and fresh, I would be surprised if you didn't love this place.",

We got there we sat down we ordered we ate no one came and asked us is there anything else you would like . We wanted coffee Mary (the owner ) asked everyone else but me and my who I was with . Now this isn't no race-baiting because she has spoke to me before but something about this place was very off . It wasn't the hash house I know and love it felt like something is killing them or they were held hostage and had to play the part . But I hope they get their stuff together because even the specials aren't special anymore when I first came she had things like duck Benedict but now it just seemed like she ran out of ideas . To bad this will be the last time I come here .",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have been continuously visiting Mary's for over a year now. We try to go once a week. The food is great and it feels like home whenever we go.  We usually have Darlene as our waitress (she's my favorite)! She's really entertaining to talk to. I love her and her dry humor. She's not a ray of sunshine like most servers that just fake being happy all of the time and I admire that. You have to get to know her a little bit to realize that she's really entertaining and you can poke fun at her in return when she does it to you. We've also had Lily she's super sweet and also fun to talk to. The staff feels just like family.   We've tried several of their breakfast dishes along with some of their lunch options. I usually get the same thing tho (the senior breakfast). My boyfriend enjoys the San Diego omelette the most but he does get the corn hash every now and then.  (Rant) As for the review that claims that Darlene might be racist. I think that's SO funny. My boyfriend and I are both Hispanic and we have always gotten treated just fine (ever since day 1). Also don't call someone ugly. Appearance is not relevant to a review. I don't trust severs that decide to purposely not tip. If you REALLY didn't like the service but you liked Mary's service you could have at least tipped her.  (Rant over)  Overall I really do enjoy coming here for both the food and the great staff. They have at least 10 different kinds of jellies but I always get the sangria one (Darlene jokes around about it because she thinks it's gross but I love it). This is a great place to try especially since it's tucked away in a corner so it's not obnoxiously packed like the Egg & I or IHOP. You won't regret trying Mary's I promise that!",

    "text": "Oh, Mary, how I wanted to love your Hash House.  My husband is a bit of a hash connoisseur, so I was super excited to accidentally stumble upon Mary's Hash House. All kinds of hash AND fresh cinnamon rolls drowning in icing?? This was going to be his new favorite place!  We arrived at 10am. The sign said As Seen On Chopped & it was busy. All good signs.  You seat yourself. Mary's house house is pretty small and not fancy, but who cares as long as she's killing it in the food department, right?!?! It took a while to get menus because it seemed like there was 1 server for the entire place. Then it took a while to get our drinks. Then it took a while to get our orders taken...you see where this is going. Service is SLOW.  We ordered the Roasted Chicken Hash w/ Hash Browns, the Corned Beef Hash w/ Home Fries, & of course a cinnamon roll.  They were out of cinnamon rolls.  Our Hashes arrived. They come w/ 2 eggs and toast. They bring home made jams by on a tray for the toast. We tried the raspberry & the apple butter. My husband loved the raspberry. He later said it was the highlight of his meal. The apple butter was heavy on cinnamon. Honestly, it was pretty chunky to be called a butter or a jam.  So, this hash. My corned beef hash was OK. Flavorful & greasy. Definitely not spectacular,a bit too salty, but still good. The Roasted Chicken was awful. There is no way this chicken was roasted. Boiled maybe, but not roasted. And, it was absolutely flat & flavorless. No salt. Definitely no garlic (the menu said garlic).  The 1 server was way too busy to check on us, so there was no sending anything back or complaining. We left the eggs behind which were kinda rubbery and took the hashes home. I figured I could doctor them for lunch.  Sadly, the food missed the mark, too. If in fact Mary's was on chopped, based on this experience they didn't win.",

    "text": "Within the past six weeks, I renewed a love affair with HH, that started years ago when they were located on Spring Mountain.  I often wondered what had become of this wonderful Hash House until I located it on yelp.  There is was...the geographical location had changed but not the delicious chow, I remembered from yesteryear.    The new location offers a much larger dining area with the same waitress from days gone by running around serving hungry eaters.  Be patient with her, the food is worth it, even if the same lady (owner, Mary, I think) is not slaving away on the griddle.  The name of the game is HASH.  There are multiple variations to try.  My favorite is the party hash....not the kind you might be thinking because it would illegal but the edible persuasion.  It's got a little bit of everything, corned beef, roast beef, ham, chicken jalapenos, with mushrooms, all scrambled together.  If your a fan of jelly, they have homemade jelly here.  All sorts of delicious flavors to choose from.  I like the jalapeno flavor is sweet and sassy.  After writing this I am filled with a warm fuzzy and I am going to throw down another star!  This is not a commercialized monster you are bound to find in ever state while traveling down a major interstate.  It is a wonderful LOCAL restaurant, you should try for an awesome breakfast!!",

Well the food needs its own flare of seasoning.  Its prepared well and the portions are great but the Lamb hash was short the tastey factor.  This is all fixed easily by their awesome selection of sauces.  Habanero ketchup, chipotle sauce, all fresh made.  The thing that needs serious attention is the lack of service.  Our server was sweet and got our order right but she had the whole restaurant and the help of one buser.  Jellies were great and the food ample, but hire more wait staff and give your chef freedom to season. THAT IS ALL",

The waffle was plain in taste, along with the strawberry  \"sauce\" was nothing but that nasty thick red compote. On top of it was $10 HAHA.   So if I ever try this place again it'd be for their homemade hash that people are raving about. Hopefully all their tlc is in that.",

    "text": "After searching every hotel/casino coffee shop menu online, as well as most of the local breakfast/lunch places, I finally found a place in town that makes a proper Monte Cristo sandwich!  This little place in the Decatur & Sahara area does the Monte Cristo as it should be done: Thinly sliced ham, turkey & Swiss cheese on french toast, batter-dipped, then deep fried.  For those of you who have never had one, it may sound a bit heavy, unhealthy, fattening, and it is all of that.  It's not something that you should really eat on a regular basis, I'm sure there are tons of calories in there, but every once in a while, it's a wonderful treat!  At Mary's it comes with your choice of a side dish for $8.95, a really good value for the amount of food that you get.  The only drawback for me was the fresh fruit that you can order as a side is always strawberries & bananas.  I would prefer the traditional fresh cantaloupe, honeydew and grapes that I've had at other places in the past.  Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.  If your a fan of the Monte Cristo, do yourself a favor and check this place out.",

It's definitely a cute place to start off the day with family but first, make sure you find it.   Hash House lies along Decatur (cross street Sahara), just a couple of shops away from Aloha kitchen. It took my mom and me some time to find. Take note, if you're taking Sahara from the West, be sure to turn right before you hit Decatur.   When we got there, Mary had us pick our own seats since there weren't a lot of customers. We ordered the Super Hash (ham, roast beef, poached chicken etc) with hash browns, 2 eggs and 2 whole wheat bread. Hash House's homemade ketchup was a nice added touch and their selection of jams was quite a variety! Breakfast was decent but not special otherwise.   My mom and I love to experiment with new recipes every so often and ladies, what they have on their menu is not something you can't put together. I applaud the staff for keeping the restaurant in check and orderly, but I also believe that a restaurant should deserve more recognition if it offers something new, unique and exotic. This place may be a nice change from Denny's or IHOP although it's not one to repeat a lot.",

She's such a neat person and even brought out her copy of the Savoire magazine that the restaurant was featured in recently.  We remarked afterward that you don't get to meet Bobby Flay, Emeril or Wolfgang Puck when you go their places.  We'll definitely recommend to anyone going to Vegas.",

We initially went to another nearby restaurant that we love, however, the wait was 25 minutes and since we were starving, we decided to try this restaurant.  The hostess told us 10 minutes but we ended up waiting twice as long. There wasn't any seating so we were forced to stand for that time with our active infant.  5 tables left and still we weren't seated because no one cleaned those tables off. The environment was old and unkempt.  The candy in the entrance was so old that I'm surprised they didn't notice.  My infant sat in a run down, un-assembled high-chair dated from 1989 and not fastened by buckles, but a mans waist belt.   Finally we ordered but I wish the waitress went over the menu because my meal wasn't what I expected.  The food was bland, mushy and oily, the waitress was aloof, I had to ask for more water and the lady behind us asked twice for a to-go box.  I hated my meal so much that I didn't eat it; first time I've ever not eaten a meal ordered.  HORRIBLE SERVICE, DEPRESSING FOOD and environment.",

    "text": "This place is nothing to write home about.  Hidden away in a corner of the shopping mall near Decatur and Sahara, one would almost miss it if they weren't already trying to track it down.  As the restaurant is only open till 2pm, if you take too long to find it, you won't make it in time.  When we entered the restaurant, we found our table and the waitress dropped off the menu's without asking us if we'd like something to drink.  This would be understandable if it was slammed in the restaurant.  We were one of two or three tables occupied, however, so this with the fact that it took her another 10-15 minutes to return diminished our hopes of an enjoyable meal.  I am one to believe that a restaurant should not be entirely judged on one particular meal alone.  Much like Lotus of Siam, where it is said the Northern Menu is what the restaurant is best known for, the Hash here is supposed to be excellent.  I, however, am not a big fan of hash so I chose to not eat it (as well it was lunch).  The food that we did order (the Peasant Lunch was my choice) was decent but again, a bowl of chili, plain toast and a small cup of strawberries and banana's did not seem to be worth $6.99.  Between the two Hash House moniker's, I would recommend A-Go-Go.  Forget about the looks of either place...at A-Go-Go, the food is better all around (I don't have to limit myself to one particular type of food) and the portions are huge.  If I want a small, decently cooked home-made meal, I'll go to the 50's Diner on Jones near the 215 or Black Bear Diner on Jones and Tropicana.  Both are much more appropriate choices with better service and decent food.",

They only had two servers and two cooks with a full house. Water cup stayed empty the whole time and finally got the side of ranch that we asked for twice after 3/4 of the meal was already finished. The special spicy ketchup was pretty gross. It was really sweet and definitely not what my taste buds were expecting. The steak was overcooked. They have a variety of jams and jellies, which I thought was cool. That may have been the only thing I really liked about here. I would bump this place up to 4 stars if it wasn't for the really slow service. Perhaps I was just extra impatient that day considering I was hungover and needed food pronto.",

Big surprise, the hash house specialty - HASH.  They also have homemade breads and jellies.  I get the combo hash ( several meats mixed together ) and some rye bread.  The rye bread is good, the jelly - eh, ok but honestly,  ain't big on jellies to begin with - i prefer the bread for sopping up the tidbits.  the hash - boring for me - the portions are very \"controlled\" a definite no-no for me at a diner type place.   the cost - damn i forget - definitely under $10 including the coffee.  Overall, the food is ok but give me maple tree, black bear, jamms and if hash is your thing, i think a go-go is much more creative.",

The waitress (owner?) seemed like a real nice down to earth lady with the other customers who were most likely regulars.

In the mean time she was walking around little ramekins of jelly because there wasn't any on the tables. We weren't asked about refills or wanting anything else in the mean time. I ordered a Belgian waffle that came out cold and hard. The batter used for the waffle was plain and flavorless. My sister ordered French toast, sticky bun style. It was also cold and hard.

Only tried the Strawberry and Pineapple, but both were solid on the sourdough and full of flavor and pieces of the actual fruit. The Hash was tasty as well with shredded white meat chicken mixed in with onions, peppers and home fried potatoes. I should have gotten a different side, but I didn't know what kind of potatoes was orginally included, so I got double Home Fries basically. Will order fruit next time as the meal is pretty filling as it is and doesn't need two orders of potatoes. Eggs were cooked to my well done scrambled standards as well. Only $8 bucks, so a decent deal and if you dine-in you can try a bunch more of flavors of those jellies.   Its also pretty comical also about how the tourists don't realize what they are doing and wander in here. Probably 20% of their business! Classic.",

    "text": "You're in Vegas. What better way to continue the gluttinous theme by eating breakfast at Hash House? I went here twice, two days in a row. Although I didn't get a heart attack, if I did, it would be okay. I wasn't very satisfied with my first day's choice of entree: a large food competition-worthy banana pancake. Our waiter kept raving about how awesome it would be, but I think there was just too much of that and not enough bacon and eggs on the side. The freshly squeezed orange juice was delightful though. I managed to pick at some other friends' foods, including Chicken and waffle (with bacon bits!) .The second day, I stuffed my face in a Chicken biscuit/mashed potatoes dish (sorry can't remember the name), which completely compensated for the okay breakfast the previous day. The servings here are so large, even if you share with another person. Definitely a go!",

    "text": "Came here on a recommendation from a friend, ordered the party hash with fresh fruit and toast.  The lady that sat and served me was pretty curt and uninterested, whereas she was chummin it with who I assume were some locals.  No biggie, as long as the food's good I can take or leave sociability to be honest.  Good, however, is not the word I finally chose to describe the food I consumed.  The party hash consists of everything in the super hash, with mushrooms and jalapenos to boot.  While I was eating, I found myself thinking, \"if the party hash is this bland, how the hell must the super hash taste (without mushrooms and jalapenos)??\"  After the hype (which could barely be qualified as \"hype,\" maybe better described as mild promotion) it was a let-down.  Fresh fruit was some pitiful watermelon cuts and banana slices.  The jelly was VERY good (IMO the best thing about the place).  It was THE only aspect of our entire interaction that the server displayed any modicum of enthusiasm (not that I need some f*in Carrot-Top server, but she was definitely a downer).  In this though, she came to the table with a tray of jelly options and offered it to me for the toast.  It was impressive and delicious =D  Again, that really is the only good thing about the place.  It's called Hash House and I tried what was supposed to be one of the sig dishes, and yet I think my Pops enjoyed his biscuits and gravy much more than I enjoyed my meal.  If you're starving, and you're there, go ahead, but I'd probably try something OTHER than one of their hash dishes, and DON'T SKIP the toast and jelly",

    "text": "This place probably gets mistaken for the Hash House A Go Go a lot.  However, when we called to make reservations, the person who answered the phone specifically asked us TWICE if we were sure we weren't looking for Hash House a Go Go.   I ordered a Spanish omelet.  It was pretty good.  Had a little bit of butter flavor, which I generally don't like, but the overall flavor of the omelet was decent.  The olives and jalapenos in there were very good.  I shared the omelet and was still full.  It came with a choice of 2 sides; I went with cottage cheese and hash browns. The hash browns were standard; I enjoyed them.  I thought the portions were pretty good.    The coffee was also decent.  It was good enough that I could drink it black.  There were also free refills on the coffee, which I certainly took advantage of.    They had several homemade sauces that I thought were notable.  The habanero sauce had a good flavor, and was kind of sweet and interesting.  The chipotle had a usual smoky flavor (I like the habanero sauce better).  They also had a really interesting spicy ketchup, but by the time I tried it I had so many hot sauces that my mouth was on fire, and I couldn't really notice the spiciness of the ketchup.  My friends ordered the corned beef hash and enjoyed it.  This place also has an impressive variety of homemade jam, desserts, and dog treats for sale.  I didn't get a chance to try all of it, but I thought it was rather neat.  I really like the cozy, quirky, homemade mom and pop feel here.  The prices were like a Denny's ($7-$9 for an omelet), but the food was more unique.   We came in a group of 10 people, and I thought service was reasonably fast, friendly, and they definitely kept the coffee coming.",

The restaurant tables were all occupied so I marched my little legs over to the bar where there was open seating!  Mary, the owner, immediately approached me after I sat down and wiped down the counter.  Very friendly woman!    There are two options for coffee, medium roast and bold roast.  I couldn't help myself when it came to the refills and ended up downing 3 mugs worth!  Tried both brews and both hit the spot.  A variety of creamers are provided like french vanilla, hazelnut, and irish cream to name a few.  My brother and I split 3 dishes.  The Party Hash consisted of a nice variety of flavors.  The mixture of chicken, corned beef, ham and roast beef all worked well with the mixed veggies.  Some of the jalapeno slices had a real kick!  Fresh jalapenos are used so be warned if your tolerance for spicy food is low!  (4 stars)  The Corned Beef Hash was lacking in the meat department.  Not sure if this was an isolated incident or if that's normal, but the meat was definitely seasoned/cooked nicely!  This comes with your choice of eggs and I went with sunny side up!  Overall, not bad. (3.5 stars)  The Monte Cristo was my favorite dish above all!  The thin sliced ham and turkey is nice and juicy!  Gooey Swiss cheese... that speaks for itself.  This is served inside some sweet homemade bread (mmm... the hint of vanilla) which was fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside!  For any first timers out there, picture French Toast meets Grilled Cheese.  You can approach this beast in 2 ways.  The first way would be to drizzle syrup on top and attack it with a fork/knife.  The second way would be to grab a slice with your hand and dip it into the syrup.  Call me a savage, but the second way should be the only option allowed. (5 stars)  Both plates of hash came with a choice of sides:  Fresh Fruit - I chuckled when I was brought out strawberries and bananas.  Not what I expected when I placed my order, but no complaints here.  Wheat Toast - The homemade bread was delicious!  This was purposely ordered as an excuse to try out the homemade jelly!  Tried the pumpkin and jalapeno which were both fantastic!  So fantastic that I actually bought a jar of both flavors (yes it's made and sold there)!  Homefries - This side was recommended by the server.  I was expecting french fries, so I was slightly disappointed... wish the server or the menu had provided a description.  My best attempt at describing this dish would be \"steamed potato meets hash brown.\"  Hopefully the picture provided along with this review will help that description.  They were good, but nothing special.  This was my first, but definitely not my last visit.  The staff was very attentive and kind.    P.S. Be warned that the wait time for food is a little on the long side!",

My roommate is also obsessed with this place.  The staff has mostly been there for years so they are now all friends of ours we go visit a couple times a week.  If you are alone, sit at the bar.  I have had some of the most interesting conversations with strangers at that bar.    Always ask for the specials and make sure you wave at Martha, Darlene and Mary for me. :)",

    "text": "Super quaint mom and pop restaurant, located off the strip. Recommended for those who prefer a homey and cozy feel, as opposed to a chain hash restaurant. We only waited about 15 minutes to be seated BUT after we ordered our food- we waited about 1.5 hours until our food was actually served! At one point we were even debating on when to up and leave.  I suppose the delay was due to several factors: - Only 3 servers were waiting tables - 1 person cleaning tables and doing double duty as hostess.  - Observed 2 kitchen chefs cooking  We had 2 orders of corned beef hash, a chicken hash and a bowl of tomato basil soup. The food was delicious! I really enjoyed the corned beef hash. The hostess also provided us with samples of homemade jam to go with our toast. There were several flavors: watermelon, guava, pineapple, raspberry amd strawberry.   I would definitely come back again, if the wait was not as long. You can see that the servers were working really hard and they were always hustling. I would recommend for them to hire 1 or 2 more additional staff members. They definitely need the help.  Overall great food, but not for the person who is on the go, or in a time crunch. If the wait time between ordered food and served food was significantly less, I would have upped my rating to 4 stars.",

Our friend was looking for a place which served hash browns, and simple diner place for breakfast. We found this place on yelp, as Dennys had an extremely long wait everywhere in Vegas on a Sunday morning. This place is a bit informal (we waited about 10 minutes to seat ourselves).   Prices were very reasonable - I shared strawberry waffles with my friend which came with a side of bacon and eggs. The entre was about $10.95, which is a great deal for breakfast - especially for two people. The portions are definitely large enough to share with a friend. My friends ordered the omelet and breakfast plates, and all loved their dishes. The breakfast plates came with sides of toast, which had about 20 different jam varieties to choose from. I also ordered some orange juice -which was extremely sweet and fresh squeezed, always a great plus from a diner.",

We sat down; our server was the type of lady you would find in a place like this; she had a dry sense of humor which can go either way depending on a person sensitivity level. Luckily, I speak dry wit, so I found her hilarious!  The menu is simple here, not a huge selection which I don't mind sometimes. I ordered the waffles with strawberries which I substituted the eggs for hash browns. The waffles were excellent, but the hash browns were pretty bland. They could use a little flower for sure.

I had the biscuits and gravy special.  The biscuit was so good and same thing with the Gravy.  A side of bacon and house fries... The other times I came here I had the western omelet.  My friend Vinny had the waffles and he said it was  \"Really good\".    The location is on Decatur, and Sahara.  Its not a hole in the wall but it would be hard to spot off of the street.  Its in the closed down Circuit City center.  Mary herself has a very bubbly and interesting sense of humor.  The waitresses are pretty attentive and are always walking around passing out jelly samples for your toast.  I had strawberry and peach.  They even had jalapeno jelly...My friend vinny said it was good.  All in all I would definitely come here for breakfast.  Super good and fresh.  I always sat at the bar area around the TV but from what I can tell they are usually busy so get there early.",

The home fries were good and well incorporated with little bits of  onion and green peppers.  The  jalapeno  seasoning on the table was delicious over the hash . The waffle plate was sub-par. It felt like it was previously frozen or it was made from earlier and he just reheated it. It was soft, salty and not crispy at all.  The jam shots are bomb!  The service was sweet and quick.",

It was a Sunday morning and there a bunch of open tables. We were told to pick a table so we did. After that it took a good 20 minutes before the lady came back to get our order and I was a bit annoyed because other tables who came in after us was getting their order taken. However, they had a different server so I'm not sure why our server was slow.   We ordered and the kids menu is very minimal. I ordered the original corned beef and hash with over medium eggs. My eggs came out sunny side up and runny all over the place. My corned beef hash was like burnt hash browns. The flavor was lacking and it was just overly crispy except for my eggs. On the plus side she asked if I wanted all of the peppers and onions and she was able to omit those.   Overall I did not enjoy the food at all. Cool that they have homemade jelly but it didn't balance out that I had burnt food. Service was mediocre at best but it is what it is. I definitely would not come back when there are so many other breakfast places that are awesome.",

The cleanliness of the dining area could be better and the bathroom wasn't that pleasant but the part that got me the most is the seating. It can be a little cramped.   THE FOOD!! I will definitely go to this spot many times for the food. Everything I tried (three dishes) was wonderful.   The main dishe I had was the Argentina eggs Benedict with mariscos (shrimp). The spices they use with the hollandaise sauce goes perfect with the poached eggs and shrimp. I will definitely get that again.   It is a little off the strip but worth the drive. If you are in the Las Vegas area, I highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "We waited 37 minutes to get our food and our waitress was a miserable excuse of a server. Towards the end of our meal, my husband and I were in agreement - we hate our waitress. HATED her. Okay, so we came here on a Saturday morning around 11AM. We tried Eggs & I first, but they had a wait time of 25 minutes. I think if we just would've waited there instead, we'd have been much happier.  WAFFLE SPECIAL ($7.55): A Belgian waffle served with 2 eggs and 2 slices of bacon. Gave the husband my bacon, who thought they were pretty delish. The waffle wasn't anything special, nor were the eggs. Very underwhelming. 2/5  CHICKEN HASH ($8.45): Ordered with a side of fruit and 2 eggs. My husband said the dish was bland. According to the menu, the chicken is 'garlic-poached', but my husband didn't detect any garlic undertones. 2/5   SERVICE: A white-haired woman with glasses greeted us as we walked in and seated us immediately. She was awesome. An older lady with short brown hair and no personality is what doomed our visit. When taking our food orders she walked up to the table and just stood there, silent. Finally, she mumbled \"Need a moment?\". We gave her our orders and she scurried away. She didn't interact with us until she brought some food to the table, which wasn't ours. She took the plates away and said \"Oh I thought these were yours\". Eons later, our food comes. Not once did she return to check up on us or offer refills. I would've liked more butter and syrup but seeing as how she avoided us, that never happened. Lady had a perpetual frown on her face. If you're not service oriented, you shouldn't be a waitress! Also, it irked me that the check wasn't itemized and that there weren't fountain drinks, only bottled cokes. 0/5  VIBE: Old-school breakfast diner complete with ceiling fans and box TVs.     Worth a Return Visit? Other waitresses seemed to be competent and friendly. We got the bad apple. The food was unimpressive and took waaay too long to arrive at our tables. There's a problem in the kitchen and a problem with service here.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #218",

Instead, waiters, or waitresses, couldn't be bothered with such nonsense, and seem to want as little to do with you as possible. When I went with my wife, HH was in no way busy. When our waitress got around to our table, she was visibly in a rush and even said she had other tables to get to. Good thing we had been sitting there for a bit and were ready to order. After an even longer wait for our food to arrive, we were presented with food that couldn't compete with even the lowliest of diners. My waffle was literally, and I literally mean literally, tasteless. And the shot of syrup they give you does nothing to help.  My wife said her hash browns mainly consisted of grease; she ordered them specifically to be more crispy.  Again, our waitress could not have less to do with us if she tried. Randomly, in the middle of eating she quickly placed the check down on the corner of the table and darted off. She never once asked how the food was. She never once offered us anything else. She never once even asked if we need more water. Long story short, avoid this place. This is not one of those cool, hole in the wall places. This is a one star restaurant with one star service and one star food. Do yourself a favor, stay at home and make your own breakfast. Even if you can't cook, you'll at least be treated better.",

    "text": "Mary's Hash House experience was unusual. Definitely a hole in the wall diner. Upon arriving, my partner and I noticed dishes piled high against the wall of the bar area, at the tables in the main room, and later, we discovered the same at every empty table in the second dining room that we were seated at. We waited for at least 5 minutes along side two other groups of people for someone to welcome us. I believe it was Mary herself who added us to a waiting list, and told us it would be about 10 minutes before they would be able to clean off a table for us. We watched as the waitstaff wandered around the dirty tables as in a state of confusion, and never saw a dedicated buser the entire time we were there. We had plenty of time to review the menu while waiting at the front, so when we were sat, we ordered everything immediate, in hopes to speed up the process. We were sitting among dirty tables the entire time , which made us feel uneasy, and our order took forever. The food was good, but not great, and with the dirty tables all around us, we didn't feel like we could enjoy our food. We were perplexed, considering both of us have worked in the service industry, and have experienced busy periods during our shifts. Looking around, it didn't appear to be that busy, just a totally unorganized older waitstaff. The jalapeno jam was bright and delicious. Strangely enough, the jam was brought around in a tray that resembled a Jell-O shot tray, so that added to the uniqueness of that odd place. I'm not going back, and I certainly would not recommend this place to friends. We waited 50 minutes for our food, and the diner wasn't even half full at any point during our time there.",

Friends' omelettes and hashes were all super-well received.  Fruit (bananas and strawberries) was even seemingly fresh cut.  Service was great.  Perfect getaway from the sometimes zombie/mass-prepared food of the Strip.  Driving through/around Asia-town also allows for banh-mi or dumplings pick up.",

I decided try their Superhash on recommendation of the bus boy.   For two sides that are included, I chose the hash browns and cottage cheese.  My friend ordered the superhash as well with hash browns and fruit.  THIRTY minutes later, we finally get our food.  What the heck?  Other people were seated after us and got their food in less than FIVE minutes.  The food was disappointing.  The serving size was very small and miserable and our food was COLD!  Why oh why me?  I felt robbed having to pay for the food.  We left afterwards in search of a decent meal.  I wanted to like this place based on other yelpers' reviews, but I have to disagree with them on this one.  Poor service and food.  I'd rather skip a meal than eat here again.",

Basically Decent food ... Bad service.  We sat down the restaurant was maybe 40% full. It took 15minutes for someone to show up and take our drink order (no fountain drinks.. only $1.40 cans of soda???)  It took another 15-20 mins for us to get the attention of our waitress. I finally had to send my son to search for her. She took our orders and dissapeared again.  When they brought the food (finally) it was really good. Everyone loved the homemade jellies. I had the super hash which has everything. It was a little dry but good.  So after being ignored for an hour and getting the absolute minimum service (the bus-lady helped us more.. she brought my forgotten toast) I tipped $7 on a $52 bill. The waitress looked at the tip line on the ticket and scowled... I don't want to get into a \"how much to tip\" battle, but if you give crappy service and then scowl at a ~15% tip then I'm done with you.  We won't be back",

    "text": "Short story: come here for slow, crappy service and sub-par food.  Long story: Not knowing any better, I figured we would give Hash House a try given the 1 hr wait at the HHAGG. Big mistake.   Walking through the door, I get the feeling this is my kind of place--  homey, seat yourself, etc. (In reality, it was actually like stopping for breakfast at my ex-mother-in-law's house after I ran over her cat. But I really don't have an ex-mother-in-law nor did I run over her cat.)  But back to breakfast-- after we seat ourselves, we wait 5 minutes before we are handed menus. (Were we supposed to grab them ourselves, I wonder? Possible faux pas which I will own.) But I think the icy stare from the owner/waitress was unnecessary and you could have asked for our beverage order...or just greeted us...anything.   Coffee seems to take forever to arrive, and while we are waiting to order, I realize that the folks at two other tables have been/are still waiting for their food. (I thought folks were wrapping up their meal, but the fatigue on their faces was not from being overstuffed, it was from malnourishment.)  Now, based on other reviews, you might think that we were here on a particularly busy morning or something. Something, anything rational to explain the long wait for food. No, I think it has to do with a kitchen staff (actually I only saw 1 guy) who is not a short order cook. It looked like he was preparing 1 plate at a time...and slowly.  I order the corned beef hash, my wife picks the salmon and eggs. (She admitted she was delusional.) While the hash may be made to order, it was unremarkable. My wife's salmon was overcooked beyond recognition and yet, her eggs and home fries were cold. We tell our server and ask her to take it off the bill (because my wife will kill someone if she has to wait for something else to come out of the kitchen).   So we get the bill, and surprise, she didn't charge for the salmon. (Reflecting back, I did say that the salmon was overcooked and we didn't want it... I did not say that we don't want to pay for the cold eggs and home fries...what was I thinking.)  OK, so I realize this is your livelihood and you can't just give away food the same way you do at a buffet (or Denny's) but do you see how it might be a bit offensive to charge for the barely edible food on the plate that was not sent back? Like we go around sending food back so we can get a meal comped...   Lesson learned-- never eat here again. Even if the HHAGG has an hour wait.   P.S. I hear HHAGG has a second location in Imperial Palace... I would go to the strip before going back to the craptastic Hash House.",

My friends had the eggs and bacon breakfast and said it tasted like eggs and bacon (which is always a good sign).  Things that are awesome are the home made jellies in all different flavors (and I mean ALL DIFFERENT flavors like Sangria, Mandarin, Habanero, etc.), so you've got to try them out.  Also, their home made chipotle sauce is amazing  The spicy ketchup is more sweet than spicy, but that may have just been the batch that we got.  The juices come in a plastic bottle, so I am not so much a fan--I prefer fresh squeezed orange juice, or at least concentrate in a glass...   If the orange juice was better and the hash was less dry, this would be a five star; the jellies and home made sauces are the life savors for this place.  It's a little out of the way, but worth it to avoid the mess of the strip on Sunday morning.",

It had corned beef, ham, roast beef, chicken, jalapenos, mushrooms, onions, and peppers served with 2 eggs, toast, and potatoes. It was good, but nothing I'd actually come back for. My boyfriend has actually been here before and he raved about the homemade jams they make. We saw the waitress go around to 2 other tables offering them jam from the tray she was holding for their, but she never came to us with it, so we had to go up to her and ask for some and she made the busboy bring some over to us. The selection was pretty awesome. They had apple butter, apple-jalapeno, habanero, strawberry, peach, watermelon, blueberry, raspberry, and grape. I went with the apple butter and Donald got watermelon. The apple butter was very tasty and the watermelon was interesting, but a little too sweet. I'd definitely come back here just to sample some of their other flavors.",
