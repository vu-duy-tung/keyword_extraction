    "text": "I wanted to try a new sushi place, and this was close by. I have also seen a groupon for this place as well so I thought why not. I walked in and was greeted, but it was awkward because I stood there for a few seconds then had to ask if I needed to seat myself and the hostess was like well what do you want? The bar, hibachi,  or dining? I had my 1 year old with me, she took me to my table then left. Nothing said, so I kind of assumed she was getting me a high chair? Nope, stood there for a minute, sat down because I was just going to wait for my waiter to ask for a high chair. It was obviously too long to where I had to go back up there and ask for one. Waiter was nice and attentive. Food- eeeehhh no so good. I was starving too, everything's good when you're starving. Hahaah. The rolls were... Dry? If that's even possible. Not a lot of selections on their menu like you see at other sushi restaurants. I see a bunch of stuff cluttered in a corner? Kinda tacky. Wasn't a horrible experience or anything just won't be back.",

Food taste good but not filling that much, very small amount of beef. If you are big person or really hungry, you need to order a lot of food, not just regular entrees. Total time exactly was in and out 3 hours and I am not exaggerating here!! It is overpriced even with groupon that amount of food we got. If you want to experience the environment that he cook front of you and if you have lots of time to spend go for it, taste was good.",

    "text": "This was a horrible experience. To start, we arrived for our reservation promptly at 6:30 but we're asked to wait about ten minutes. The two other couples that we were seated with had been waiting at least 30-40 and had already placed their orders when we sat down. After placing our order, we waited an additional 30 minutes for the chef to arrive. When he started the routine of clashing and flipping the large knife and cooking fork, he lost grip of the fork and it flung into the chest and arm of a person. He was thankfully unhurt but the chef said nothing and continued cooking with the same utensil (Health code violation). Our party was sitting directly across from the chef and was splattered repeatedly with hot oil from the cooking process. Even after mentioning it to the chef, it continued to happen to the point that we had to hold up our napkins to keep from getting splashed or burned. Again, no acknowledgments or apologies from the chef. Several times the chef dropped vegetables on the table where people eating and either picked it up to keep cooking it or to place it on a plate. Disgusting and another violation. He also placed some shrimp on the wrong plate and asked the person to give it to the right person. What? The food was mediocre and, at the end of our meal, the member of the table that was hit with the large cooking fork went to speak with the manager, who happens to be the owner's son. The conversation went fine as we were simply trying bring to management's attention our chef's weaknesses. We stated that we weren't upset, the chef was never outright mean but the meal was not worth paying over $100 for between the several health code violations, hot oil splatters/burns and large fork hitting someone. The manager asked for a minute to see what he could do about our bills. He came to our table with a single $20 certificate to be used next time. After we explained the experience we had again, we asked for a discount on the meals we had or to apply a $20 gift certificate to each bill. The manager refused and said, if we didn't pay, he would call the police (which I've noticed is a trend in these reviews) and accused our party of just wanting a free meal. I have never witnessed a restaurant that was so rude and inconsiderate. Our party intended to pay for our meal but with the terrible experience, multiple oil burns and flying fork at a person's chest, we were hoping for some sort of consolation discount. Instead we were insulted and rudely treated by the young, arrogant manager. We will never be eating here again and highly discourage others as well.",

Honestly, I feel like the place has turned into a roller skating rink dance party with sushi on the side. The service is beyond horrible. After being seated, we sat there for at least 10 minutes without anyone even coming over to ask us for our drink orders. I finally sent my husband to find the manager; we were told that no one communicated to the wait staff that we had been seated (even though every waiter AND the manager looked directly at us several times) oh and did I mention there was only one other party at one of the Teppanyaki tables in the restaurant and a couple sitting at the bar. The food was just okay, with the exception of the Creme brulee (don't try it, it's gross and way overpriced). As for the amenities, the restroom is just hideous...it looks like all the money was tapped out on the unnecessary disco lights, trying too hard out of place decor, and the wannabe club scene at a joke of a bar with way too loud music. To the owners of Osaka in Summerlin, I'm really sorry guys but it's just the harsh truth and you are failing to be awesome - hopefully you can turn it around.",

    "text": "I had a good time with my friends here a couple of weekends ago.  I used to go to Samurai with my family when I was a kid in Ohio- they were the first of the restaurants I'd heard about where the food was prepared teppan style, at your table, which is actually a grill.  Samurai was overtaken by Benihana's, which I never visited, so Osaka was a nice reminder of the fun I used to have at Samurai.  Before all of our group arrived, a couple of us sat at the bar where the friendly waiter showed us pictures of the place during their evening DJ event. Twice a week they have laser lights and DJ'd music that is apparently pretty fun- the DJ even dances on the bar, so it must get pretty lively sometimes. I'm gonna have to check that out!  When you eat in the teppan area, your group is seated at one side of the large table, and a group of strangers is given the other seats. Everyone orders at once so that the chef cooks for the whole table. This means that if one of your party is late, too bad. The chefs are pretty entertaining- very silly, creating a party atmosphere.    We had a fun time at dinner, as our chef was a real performer. One of the women in my party discovered that every noise she made was incorporated into our chef's performance, which made for some hilarious \"call and response\" moments between the two of them.  Displaying knife skills, juggling know-how and other odd talents, the chefs give you a pretty fun experience.  I suspect that working there can be fun, since each chef likely has his own \"act\".  Ours liked to play the harmonica at opportune moments.   I like the decor here- very stylish and hip. The food is somewhat pricey, so this is definitely only an occasional experience, but its good, and during happy hour, the food is more affordable. They do a good job with the sushi as well. I think I'd come here more often for happy hour than for the teppanyaki experience, and that's not a bad thing.",

Asked if I could pay the difference and was told by the manager \"no next time read the fine print\"!! They expect you to pay $17 extra for a $2 up charge PER ITEM which I already paid for, are you kidding me!!!!! Also, the 4 drinks included??? We ordered Coors light and Miller light and THOSE were an up charge!! Really, those are the cheapest beers out there and so far from being unreasonable!!! To make matters worse, they CHARGED AN 18% gratuity and we only had 4 people. Come to find out it's ONLY for Groupon customers, HOW IRONIC!!!!

We tried again another night at an earlier time and were seated promptly. The waitress and chef both were friendly, attentive and provided excellent service. The food did not match that level. The scallops were excellent  and the shrimp good. Unfortunately the chicken was overcooked, tough and pretty tasteless. The vegetables were OK but the fried rice was missing something and seriously lacking in flavor. The  \"show\" was good, pretty much the standard fare in these teppanyaki style restaurants.

My friend had the white tuna sashimi which she said she liked. The place has a nice ambiance. Our server was Jeremy and this kid was very good. Polite attentive and checked on us regularly. There was a problem with the bill but it was taking care of (they overcharged me). I have been to a few Sushi places in Vegas with many more to go this is a nice place but not at the top of the heep.

The nigiri was just average. The cuts ranged in my order from the unagi being very tiny to an adequate sized hamachi. Flavors and freshness were not bad, but also nothing to get excited about. The nigiri on their late night menu is cheap, starting at $2.50. The hamachi nigiri came automatically with jalapeno on it which is not a traditional preperation and not mentioned on the menu. Don't get me wrong, I like jalapeno but at least give me a choice in the matter.  This particular location is on the other side of town from where I live and I actually think the east side Osaka is much better quality the few times I have been there. Because of that and the middle of the road experience, I don't really have any reason to go back. If you're looking for a great experience in this area head to Yummy Sushi which is right down the street. Very fresh fish including a good selection of live items.",

We had a full hibachi table and our chef was very good and entertaining. Our waitress was pleasant and kept our drinks full. It was explained to us at the beginning of our meal how the voucher worked and what would be counted as extra. FYI if you  go over the $32 food allowance it's a $17 or $10 upgrade fee. The food was delicious and a good value.",

    "text": "First step I take into nice restaurant I thought \"wow this place looks REALLY nice\" and the workers were nothing but nice and super professional and just very amazing. Seated right away, drinks were brought no wait AT ALL. I was only brought in here by a groupon other than that I wouldn't have even found this place.  I order a red rock roll, crunch tempura roll, baked mussels and a salmon bento box. ($20 for the whole bento which is totally worth the price)  The red rock roll is tuna on top with salmon and you can really taste the quality of the fish. The mussels (I'm a big fan of mussels only when they're fresh so ordering mussels is a big risk for me lol) I was NOT DISAPPOINTED. They were actually very delicious the mussels tasted fresh and a little crunchy Bc they're baked lol so it tasted even better.  The bento box just completely filled me up, the salmon was cooked to perfection and the aesthetics of the whole bento was so appealing to the human eye I finished it so fast made it taste even better hahaha  Total $50 for all that, super good deal.  They even offer teppanyaki here so if you want a fancy place to go for a special night id recommend it here. If you're coming for dinner you may need to make a reservation it looks like it gets really busy.  My server was Andrew and he was the BEST server ever. Never for a moment did I need to wait on the server for refills or anything, he was on point with his job and he's very funny too what a character that guy haha. I completely enjoyed dining here I'm definitely coming back again and I'll bring all my friends.",

    "text": "If you're looking for an interactive dining experience, it doesn't get much better than sitting around the grill at a Japanese restaurant. Some call it \"teppanyaki.\" Others call it \"hibachi.\" I call it delicious!   I've been to a few teppanyaki restaurants in Vegas and in other cities across the nation, but this was the first time I tried the Osaka in Summerlin. They had a Groupon going, so I bought the deal and hit the grill with my husband. Part of the fun of hibachi dining is getting to meet your neighbors, and our new biker buddy Ed and his family certainly made our experience more interesting! Ed's group had the Groupon, too, so it looks like that deal was a big draw.   My husband had the ribeye, and I had the filet. As per most teppanyaki restaurants, the meals were served with miso soup, a salad, grilled vegetables, and rice (we both ordered it fried). The chef made quite a show slicing and dicing, and while some diners might have been offended by a few of our guy's risque jokes, they fit right in with us (and Ed!).   The food was on par with other teppanyaki we've had, although the chef was a little heavy handed with the garlic. My husband and I each had a Kirin draft (which was part of the Groupon deal), and we also split a large Sapporo. And it seems like they have a pretty extensive sake menu, if that's your thing.   You know the place is good when you see local celebrities eating there, as was the case here. Frankie Moreno and his crew were at the next table, and in an \"only in Vegas moment,\" Ed's daughter and son-in-law had just happened to have seen Moreno's show at the Smith Center. When they shared that news with the singer, he sent over a bottle of champagne and happily posed for pictures.   Full and happy, we rolled out of the restaurant. Our garlic breath may have lingered a little longer than we wanted, but so will our memories of a fun night with Ed and company. If you try Osaka (and I suggest you do), hopefully your seatmates will be just as colorful and your chef will be a little lighter on the garlic!",

I knew thay I would be seated with others at the grill, no biggie I thought.  We arrived at our reservation time,  yes we had to be seated with others.  Upon walking up to the hibachi,  there was a family sitting there with another coupe,  cool.  The waitress seats us,  only 2 seats left.  The lady looks at me and my mom,  rolls her eyes,  gives us a look of death.  She says our table is full you can't sit here.  I look at the waitress.  She asked the lady why can't they sit,  she says that the seats were taken.  Waitress states that those seats weren't included in her reservation.  Waitress calls over the manager and the manager says we,  Me and Mom will be sitting here. My Mom tells the manager we don't want to sit no where where we aren't welcome.  We asked to sit at the other grill.  We were told no due to there were only 2 hibachi chefs,  so we sit in regular dining.  The whole purpose of coming here was  for hibachi.  5 minutes passed a couple was seated at the other grill.  I call the manager over,  long story short, the manager cut me off,  told me 3 lies. Then preceded to say to my Mom looks like your having a hard Mother's Day,  I  said yes,  she says oh sorry I lost my Mother too.  I said this restaurant ruined our day.  The food was a bit tasteless. Which is not normal as I have been here before. Food is much better from the hibachi grill as opposed to the kitchen.",

Not only was he skillful but also very personable. He was making jokes and interacting with us. Seriously super funny!  Overall my experience was a 10 and the cleanliness of the place is also a 10.

Having been to the Sahara location for sushi on several occasions, I saw a Groupon for the Summerlin location and figured \"why not?\" Definitely one of the lower end hibachi experiences I've had, and trust me that I've had my share. I can say that I have no complaints about the service and that was the only saving grace from this being a 1 star review.  But the rest of the experience...meh. Walking into the restaurant, we were welcomed by Pandora ads playing throughout the restaurant speakers. I love Pandora, but they couldn't spare $5 a month for an ad-free subscription? Although we came for the food and not the music, this is tacky.  We were seated fairly promptly at our own grill and couldn't help but notice food and used chop sticks on the floor at the adjacent tables. At this point, I'm willing to forgive the appearance of the floor hoping the food makes up for it so I brush it off. At our waitresses suggestion, we both ordered martinis that disappointed. For $11 a drink, I expect to be able to taste vodka in a martini.  Soup and salad come out shortly after the drinks. The miso soup was fine. The salad was just lettuce with watery dressing and super thin carrot slices on it. No tomatoes or cucumbers like you might find elsewhere. Although maybe a minor thing to complain about, the lettuce seemed a little warm like it was just sitting out. All I know is it definitely didn't come out of a working refrigerator any time recently.  Ok, so our chef comes out. Personable guy, does all the usual tricks, nothing out of the ordinary. I had chicken and shrimp, and she ordered scallops. The fried rice  and veggies were average, no complaints. The meat portions were small. You know the portions were small because both of us finished our meals and that's not usually the case at places like this. I got a tiny chicken breast and 7 shrimp. Her scallops were small for sea scallops and probably closer to bay scallops in size...for comparison's sake, they were maybe half the size of what you'd expect from Benihana and I'm being generous. The worst part? They tasted way fishy, so they were obviously not fresh. I considered drafting this review and waiting to see how we felt in the morning, but thought I'd post it now hoping that just in case we die that someone sees this Yelp review so they know who to sue for our wrongful deaths.  When the check came, I was blown away that this was a $98 dinner. Maybe they need to look out the window and realize this restaurant is not on the strip. At my regular hibachi place in LA, I'd get filet mignon and lobster for the same price as chicken and shrimp here. No thanks Osaka Summerlin, I'll stick to your sushi on Sahara.",

When I arrived, I had to wait an extra 15 minutes from the 20 minute wait time they gave me.  Then I got my check, turns out this \"osaka medley\" was $30, no soup, no salad. They charged me $9 for the fried rice that they ended up giving me full sized. Almost a $50 meal for dry and overcooked chicken and steak with NO sauce, overall bad experience.",

    "text": "First let me say that the food and service were great and we will definitely be back.  This Osaka location is very modern and it kind has a dance club vibe. The lights were dim & changing color and intensity which made menu-reading a challenge. (My family mocked me as I pulled out my iPhone flash light app to read the menu. LOL)The menu was a makeshift clipboard which didn't live up the classy feel of the place. There is even a DJ booth that the server said hadn't been used in some time.   We had been to other Osaka locations, so we were confused when they told us that they had no relation to the other Osakas, even though the name & logo is the same. Weird.  Osaka was completely accommodating for our family with two children (2 & 3yo) and Ana, the server was super. I was excited that there was a full bar because I like a cocktail before dinner. Many sushi places only have wine, Japanese beer & sake. They even had 2 featured martinis - Lychee and Watermelon. I went with the watermelon martini over my normal Jack&7.... call me crazy... but it was a great choice.  The only beefs I have is when sushi restaurants skimp on goodies in the sushi rolls. Our table ordered 4 rolls, and they were all super delicious. The caterpillar roll had so little eel in it you would think there was a shortage. Also, I felt that some items were a little over priced. Other than that, our experience was great!",

It was great, as always, reasonable and fun. Can't ask for more.]  I gotta give 'em 5, partially for an apology (we eat there about twice a month) and partially because it's the only sushi bar I've been to in Vegas that's any fun -- Mostly, though, it's really quite good. We generally get there a bit early (some, but not all sushi is half-price) and the bar isn't crowded so it gives to time to have a bit of fun with the chefs, who do a great job.  We've eaten in the restaurant itself a few times which is also good, just not preference, nor is the tepenyaki (sp?) area -- I'm not crazy about sitting around a hot grill with folks I don't know. But the food in that area is good as well.  It's reasonable also -- I don't think we've ever paid more than $50 for two (mostly for me) at the sushi bar...and that includes a drink, usually scotch, for me as well. And, they don't, like so many places in Vegas, \"pour light.\"  It's the only sushi spot we'll attend here.  Oh, my only complaint, which applies to so many restaurants here, they have TV in the sushi bar. What is that about?",

    "text": "This is three stars. I ordered the Mount Fuji dinner and was disappointed. But there is context to this disappointment. I am comparing them against Geisha Japanese Steakhouse on DI and Sandhill.  When asked what came with the Fuji as far as appetizers, I was told soup, salad, two shrimp appetizers, and vegetables. I made the mistake of assuming it was tempura shrimp and vegetables like Geisha. What I got was soup, a pretty good salad, and them I got two pieces of 31-40 shrimp that were cooked on the grill. The vegetables actually came at the end of it all. In between I got the fried rice($3.50!) additional charge. It was egg, rice, and soy sauce?!?!?  Then came the chicken, the three small pieces of lobster and the steak. In fairness the steak portion was pretty good, but the steak was more \"Meh\" than anything.  With the fried rice the food was almost $47.50!  For contrast, at Geisha you get the soup and salad. You get to choose an appetizer from their appetizer menu, which I normally get shrimp and vegi tempura. Then you get vegetable fried rice(no up charge), 3-5 pieces of shrimp, chicken, lobster, steak, and stir fried vegetables. On top of that you get soda or sake, or possibly another drink. I believe they are charging $35.95 for this, which is called the Geisha special.   In this context, this Osaka meal should get a 2, but I am giving it a 3, because price aside it really is deserving of a three. If you go to their website via the yelp app, there is a coupon for $20 off over $100, and a couple of others.   Geisha is the benchmark, and while it is on the other side of town, it is worth the drive. It also looks like a hole in the wall and it is. Some of the best food comes from places described as a hole in the wall.   I do however still like this Osaka for their lunch bento boxes.",

The regular prices on the menu are high enough that when they offer specials.. Well, that only means that you're paying regular price. Not at all a deal, if that's what you are looking for.  Service was fine, if a little slow. It was friendly enough. The atmosphere is very nice and romantic, and very quiet, probably because of the time we came. Not a place you would bring children, at least, if you have any respect for others. :P The food.. Meh. It wasn't really bad, but it wasn't really very good either.  For the prices they charge, it should be a lot better. I don't think I'll be returning to this one, even though it's practically next door. There are better places for sushi.  Maybe their real specialty is the habachi?",

We had the Red Rock roll, the Japanese lasagna roll and the crispy rice katami roll (I might not have that right but it's close). All were delicious. My daughter also ordered the gyozo (potstickers) and they were absolutely the best I've ever had. We got them steamed and they were the perfect combination of soft and crispy with a terrific-tasting filling. We will definitely be back!",

I came here with a big group of people for lunch and there were no redeeming qualities to this place.  The food and the service just flat sucked.    First the food.  Now I'm not a fan of sushi but I love teriyaki and all I got today was under cooked luke warm wet meat.  No flavor whatsoever.  The rest of my bento box was garbage to me.  Rice, four baby california rolls, tempura with one sad shrimp, some strange orange sauce and a very sad inedible salad.  I also ordered a watermelon martini and the only watermelon flavor it had was the garnish.  Horrible waste of alcohol.   Now on to the service, which added a mandatory eighteen percent gratuity and the server didn't get a single cent over it either, it was that bad.  Our party was all seated within a few minutes and orders were taken.  Someone was served another persons dish and the waitress insisted it belonged to the person she gave it to.  Food was being boxed up for some people before others even got their meal.  We had to continue to ask her where their food was.  To top it off the person who got the wrong dish was charged for it.  I will never recommend this place and if you are in the area craving teriyaki there is a Teriyaki Madness right next door.",

But our mood quickly darkened when the restaurant reservation we had made the day before was nowhere to be found in the reservations book. Fortunately, a group of diners waiting ahead of us decided they would rather dine at a regular table. So, our wait for seating at the grill was not long. But it was 103 degrees outside when we entered the restaurant, and not much of a contrast when seated before the grill. In that warm, sweltering room, a drop of sweat rolled down one eyeglass lens before the grill had even been heated.   To start off, eager to sample some sushi, I ordered a Spicy Tuna Roll. But I can't comment on it, because it never arrived. Near the end of my meal I realized that I never received this appetizer, and told our server that I no longer wanted it. He just smiled and, without uttering an apology, said matter-of-factly that he would take it off our check. Really? It never should have been charged in the first place.   But most of the food we did receive was very good. Miso Soup with green onion and tofu was very tasty. But a mixed green salad with Romaine Lettuce, carrot shavings, and ginger dressing tasted bitter and was just okay. Two tender, succulent medium-sized Shrimps only whetted the appetite. Shrimp was available as a side order, and I wished I had ordered it to enjoy a greater quantity. Grilled vegetables--especially the zucchini--were juicy and just exuded flavor. Tender sliced cubes of Filet Mignon were cooked perfectly medium-rare as ordered, although the dipping sauce for the meat was thinner than would be ideal. Lobster tails looked very pretty sizzling on the grill, and the plump morsels of cooked lobster meat were tasty and somewhat sweet. Our teppenyaki master was engaging and friendly, and very skilled at his craft. He certainly knew how to grill! Egg-enhanced Fried Rice was as good as I have experienced. Just delicious!  (Long-grained Steamed White Rice was moist and tasty as well.)   As we were walking out of the restaurant, I realized that we had received our bill without first being asked whether we were interested in any dessert. The <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> deduction helped to cushion what would otherwise have been a pricey dinner ($31.95 for one order of Filet Mignon & Lobster alone), but it comes with an automatic 18% gratuity. We still had a good meal, but the multiple miscues certainly detracted from the overall experience.",

Ultimately, I feel like the restaurant could benefit immensely from being on one of those Food Network restaurant makeover shows.  It's a shame because this place has a lot of potential.    We came tonight because we were sold on a great Groupon deal.  6 dinners for $130.  Can't beat that!!    Let's start with the positives.  Food is tasty.  Not the highest quality meats or fish, but still pretty tasty.    Service is good.  Our server's name was Ocean.  Very sweet and very accommodating.  We felt bad for her because servers here apparently have to bus their own tables.  Wth?!  That's a personal pet peeve of mine.  Dirty dishes stacked up next to you because nobody is there to clear it.   And drinks don't get refilled.  I think the mood is set when you first walk into the restaurant.  It is so outdated.  You feel like you're back in the 80's.  I was looking around for an old Nagel print hanging on the wall.    IMO - You can tell a lot about a restaurant from the bathroom.  Their bathrooms look like unfinished home projects.  Spackle on the wall, unfinished paint, really old fixtures, and a tiny desk waste basket for trash.  lol.   I think a change in ownership could make this a hot spot.  But I suppose their model of discounts, groupons, and promotions pay the bills for now.",

Jorge our not Asian chef was very entertaining and the food was good.  I can't say that we've ever had a bad meal at these type of establishments.  Enjoyed the experience and food.  Had they had the drinks that were on the menu I would have rated this 5 stars.  Potstickers were perfectly delightful and delicious. I had the Ribeye & Shrimp.... Yuhummmmm! Partner had the NY Strip & Chicken also mouthwatering goodness!",

The overall dinner experience was very good though. We were seated immediately, served very quickly and all the food was delicious.   I'm not sure if I'd return without the groupon but it was still a very good time.",

Sticky, yucky menus are an automatic turn off for me. Then the table bulletin was so covered in filth we could hardly read it. They have fabric table clothes covered by a paper table cloth and I noticed a grease mark and when I lifted the paper covering there was a piece of rice underneath left by a pervious customer that was the cause of the grease mark.   The food was good. But \"happy hour\" only applies if you're at the bar???  I'm a heavyset woman and it's difficult for me to sit at the bar!!!  Descrimination???!!!  We were in a booth.  I can't believe that such a fine dining(appearance) restaurant would be so dirty!!    And they have NO all you can eat!!   I won't go back.  There are too many other places that I can go for sushi!!!",

We have been faithful customers to the restaurant for over 15 years.  I had a dinner reservation for 7:30 for four people. We arrived on time and checked in with the host. After waiting about 15 minutes I kindly asked the hostess / owner if our table was ready. She clearly had forgotten that we were there and waiting and informed me that she had given our spot to a group that had just walked in with no reservation. However, she said this in a rude tone and began to accuse us of being late for our reservation. She had the audacity to raise her voice at my family over this ordeal. I asked her when the next table would be ready and she said two hours and then told me I should have made a reservation -- reminder, I did. The event was very embarrassing and unnecessary. Instead of apologizing for her mistake she chose to belittle and ridicule my family. Very unprofessional for a business owner...  My family was upset over the indecent treatment, especially because we were there to celebrate! We were very disappointed and left, only to find Ohjah (another Japanese hibachi restaurant) down the street! We were able to walk in and be seated immediately. The food was delicious and fairly priced. We now have a new favorite family celebration restaurant and will no longer recommend Osaka to anyone.",

    "text": "I came here with my family last night, I bought the Groupon, I paid $99 for $172 value food. According to the descriptions on the Groupon it states the deal is including 4 entrees up to $32, actually it's not, we order two hibachi specialties each is $37, we suppose to pay $5 different, but we actually need to pay additional $17 for each order. Our sever is Ocean, she didn't explain well on how the Groupon works, and we didn't know what size are the entrees, to be safe, we decided to order two hibachi specialties( $37 each)and two regular hibachi($32 each) The portion was really surprising me! The lobster is very tiny! It's about 2-3 small bites, the scallops dish is 10 little pieces, The prime ribs is less than 5 little bites, I never see the dishes that small! The cooker is fine, I always smile, but he has not much expression, he cooked well on the seafoods, but the vegetables were burned, it's so dark! I regret I didn't take the pictures. after we finished the meal, we still feel hungry. The seafood is fresh, so I give it one star. The bill came, we need to pay $72.17 including 18% service fee. I don't know what is up/server fee mean, so I go asked Our server Ocean, she doesn't have patience, she said I need to read the Groupon fine print, she said it's the hibachi specialties fee. I feel like I got trap here. If I don't use the Groupon, I will pay $37+$37+32+32 =$138+ tax and service fee(this menu price including sake or drinks, and 4 fried rice). I used the Groupon I paid $99+$72.17=$171.17. I think both are about the same price , but Groupon only come with 2 fried rice. So the Groupon they posted its $172 value for the meal are lying, they are not a honest business! BE AWARE if you use Groupon!! We went home ate another dinner after this meal. It's a bad experience for me.  * I'm not a big woman, I'm 108 lb  only, one bowl of pho or one sashimi deluxe is good for me. But they serve here is way less than a regular meal.",

My daughter and I were craving late night sushi so we googled Osaka which stated they were open until 1am. As we anxiously entered the restaurant we were met by a very curt  young man with light hair and glasses who immediately said, \"we're done!\"  We weren't sure what he meant and so he repeated we're done to which we asked if he meant they were closed. All we received in response was a \"yeah\" and nothing further. Wow!  So unfriendly and unprofessional. Hopefully this employee will receive some customer service training soon before he drives away all their long standing customers.",

All parts of the plate were served with such a gap that the rice and veggies were cold upon arrival of the main protein at 8:26.  The shrimp that we ordered were not deveined and the portions were unimpressive.  We left with half of our party having not eaten due to the shrimp not being cleaned properly.  Requested to immediately have the check 8:30, and to apply a voucher.  Staff refused to honor said voucher, though it had no disclaimer or fine print to indicate it could not be applied to the tab.",

About $15 per special roll and $6 for 1 order of nigiri. The QUALITY of the fish, however, is good because of that. Their special rolls aren't very exciting. I didn't see much of a variety in their rolls and the flavors don't always work with my palate...  The service has been slow every time I've gone there. This last time we went we were there for 2 hours. All we ordered were 3 rolls and 3 orders of nigiri and each roll came about every 15 minutes. I don't mind waiting if they are short staffed, but I would rather get everything at once or right after another.  Will probably stop visiting this location and continue to go to our local sushi place.",

My friends and I decided we wanted to do some hibachi tonight, thought of Osaka, checked their menu online and it said Sundays had \"happy hour\" hibachi all day for $15, so how could you pass that up...right?   We arrive at Osaka, stand in the entry for, no lie, TEN minutes before even being acknowledged. In the meantime the bartender goes back and forth between the bar and dining room and doesn't say a single thing to us, not a \"someone will be right with you\" or even a \"hi.\"  So we FINALLY get seated, then sit at our table for 15-20 minutes before even being acknowledged (again) or getting any drinks, not even a water. At this point we were contemplating leaving.   So our server finally comes and takes our order and my friend and I asked if we could do half steak half shrimp and she said she would ask the chef...she never asked him or came back to us with an answer, we just got a surprise when he started cooking. Once dinner was done, an hour and a half later, it was so bland and not tasty. You'd think after waiting so long it would be the best thing ever, but no.   So we finally get our check, and they charged us $18 for the hibachi dinner, then an additional $3.50 for the fried rice which apparently isn't included in the dinner. They never informed us of this so that was another lovely surprise we had at the end of our horrible experience.   Seriously, don't go here. There are so many other sushi/hibachi places that have good food, good service, no hidden fees and a nice environment. If I could give this review negative stars, I would.   The only good thing about the experience was that our chef was funny and Sergei, our busser, was nice and actually on top of things.   You would think that they have a happy hour to bring in more clientele, not to lose more than they already have. Yikes.",

The service was prompt, professional from the hostess, to the hibachi chef, waitress and busser.  All of the food was delicious - we ordered Chicken, Steak, Red Snapper, and Sea scallops.

We told the hostess of our celebration and the message was not given to the server. 1st of all we were sitting for more then 15 minutes before approached by anyone and then she just asked if we were ready to order. All the tables around us needed bussing and to be cleared and they remained dirty for our entire meal. Yes, all empty tables around us were filled with dirty dishes for the entire 1.5 hours we were there. Not that we wanted to be there so long but the service was so slow and we couldn't get out of there fast enough. Took forever to get our bill and we even stood at the front hostess desk to get noticed to pay. Problems all seem like a huge Mangement problem. Under staffed I would guess. The food was not that good either. I've dined out for sushi endless times and this is nothing to come back here for, especially the dirty dining room and lack of good service it wouldn't be worth the money if the food was decent.",

Luis is one of the sushi chefs along with his brother Alex and they are just fantastic. They are always willing to make new things for us to try and add the jalapeno to our dishes. The citrus salmon sushi is so darn fresh that it melts in your mouth. The hamachi sashimi with jalapeno is the best!  I'm so surprised that the reviews for Osaka Summerlin haven't been the greatest as we would never go to the one on Sahara. We think the one on Sahara is awful and smells.  If you haven't been in awhile to Osaka Summerlin please give it another try as you are missing out on fantastic food, excellent service and just a great place to eat and relax and feel at home.",

Our hibachi chef was Thurston, great entertaining chef and not to mention quite the looker! We got the hibachi chicken  a terayki and a lemon pepper. The lemon pepper was OK lacked flavor in comparison to the terayki which was amazing! The grilled vegetable were very flacorful and still had some crunch and the rice was delicious especially with extra sauce. Prices were very reasonable. My full bill came out to $60. That was 2 chicken hibachi dinners, a large Saki, and a side of spicy edamane. We will be back!",

My friend and I saw the groupon deal and without checking Yelp first to read the reviews thought we had found a good deal. At first we were told that it would be a few moments to seat us. We mentioned we had the groupon and as we went to the bar to wait the the waitress said she lied and we could be seated with another group right away. We sat and watched another group have their food prepared and then eat it for about 30-45 mins before our orders were even taken. We did get drinks and made it clear we had the deal which should've included drinks. After waiting we were given appetizers (soup) and then it took about another 10-15 minutes to take everyone's orders and prepare the food.   Long story short, while we loved the chef Thurston who was very friendly and personable and the waiter Miguel was attentive, this restaurant does not overall deserve a 5 star rating. By the end of the night and even with a groupon deal we still were charged an additional $59, which made it completely pointless to use the certificate. Plus we had to pay a tip. This restaurant looks for ways to add extra fees to the bill. They only got 3 stars for the food because it was good and the chef/waiter.",

At Osaka, there was no need to try and do that the menu selection was outstanding, our only problem was we couldn't decide which one we wanted because they all sounded so good.  We will definitely be back!  Thank you for an awesome experience.",

I found this place on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurants.com&s=8b83bf0ff8b716aae84527dc95577a310f201b166dcca25c8ca3824b15703869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurants.com</a> and we rented a car for our first day in Vegas. What a good choice.   The place looked nice on the outside and it was equally as charming on the inside. A quaint dining area, a hibachi grill and the sushi bar. We oped for the sushi bar since that is what we were there for...  The only oddity was the music selection, definitely Pandora playing (the non-subscriber channel), chock full of advertisements every 3 songs or so, a bit distracting but nonetheless a decent ambiance for the mainly 20-30s groups in there.   We decided to go the Nigiri route. Damn they have some AMAZING preparations.... We (each) had the Salmon citrus, scallop, yellowfin, San Diego Salmon, Gralic Tuna and so on...  Everything was delightful and they had Mochi as well, which my GF loves, but we were so full we opted out. I had a Kirin and a small sake (HH Special) and they were trying to get me to order another round. If it wasnt for me having to return the rental car and drive 15 minutes back into town I would have....  If and when I am back in Vegas, or if you are going soon, this is a MUST GO TO SPOT",

We had to wait for almost an hour (almost walked out the door) until he finished the other tables and came to us (poor guy had to cook two tables at one time!).

    "text": "Very disappointing. I am a big fan of the Osaka chain, and have been to both the Henderson and Sahara locations, so when I found a Groupon for the Summerlin location I snatched it up.     The only good thing about this restaurant was that we didn't pay full price. First the hostess was busy talking to another employee when we entered and seemed bothered that we had walked in. She asked \"How can I help you?\" Which seems pleasant enough but was a strange greeting for a restaurant. When I replied that there were two of us she apparently expected me to tell her whether we wanted dining, sushi bar, or hibachi grill, as she seemed annoyed that she had to ask and I hadn't originally specified. This wouldn't have even bothered me if the rest of the experience had been good, but no such luck.      The atmosphere (which is usually the last thing I care about) was very lacking. Dirty seats and walls. Paper instead of table clothes. Instead of the dim lighting adding ambiance it seemed like it was covering up a dilapidated interior.      The menu was completely different than others in the chain. They did not have my favorite dish (spicy chicken) and so I chose the chicken teriyaki. The chicken was dry and not very flavorful. The rice was no where near the Osaka standard I have come to expect. And prices were nearly 40% higher than the Sahara location.       The waiter was decent but not great. We didn't even stay for dessert, which is my favorite (Tempura fried ice cream! Yum!), as I didn't want to be further disappointed.      If you want to really experience Osaka try the Sahara location!",

    "text": "Our experience at Osaka was mixed, but with the various hibachi/teppanyaki style restaurants in the area, I don't foresee us rushing back as there wasn't really anything that set Osaka apart from their competitors. As a lot of other reviews point out, they are on the pricier side and service leaves a lot to be desired.  We (as a party of 2) had a 6:30 reservation, arrived on time, and were told we would be seated shortly with a larger party when the rest of their group arrived. No big deal, I get that it is ideal/preferable to fill up a hibachi table rather than spread your guests out- there are only so many chefs. So we waited..for about 20 minutes and their whole party was not there yet so they offered to seat us and we agreed as we were ready to get going with our dinner.   We were sat there for 5 minutes or so and then the rest of the original party we were supposed to sit with finally showed up; we were then shuffled over to that table.   From this point on, the night was more or less back on track. Food was great and our chef, Jorge, was skilled and personable. However, it is still disappointing that after having us wait an additional 30+ minutes past our reservation to even get a glass of water there wasn't really any sincere or meaningful recognition of the inconvenience from staff or management.   The restaurant itself needs some attention as well. While I sat at the bar for 20 minutes, it gave me plenty of time to look over the state and cleanliness of the restaurant. The menus are tattered, dirty, and overly worn or damaged. When I'm ordering roughly $45 worth of food and drinks per person, I expect a little pride in the menu at the very least. The space is decorated with interesting light fixtures that function almost as an art piece in and of themselves, however numerous lights were out on almost every fixture. The tiled host stand had what I can only describe as a \"band\" of dirt and gunk building up around the base where it meets the floor.   Whenever the front of the house needs attention, it's a good indicator of how things are (not) handled in the back of the house.",

Though I wasn't enticed to dine here by many of the reviews of my fellow Elites, the $25 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate we bought oh, maybe five years ago was beckoning to be used.  And I thought there must be a reason Osaka's still in business, sooo...  When we were seated, the guy asked my husband if we had a coupon.  At least he thought he asked if we had a coupon.  More about that later.  The same guy came to take our drink orders while I was looking over the list of wines.  I ordered my usual Riesling, but he said that only the house wine came with the dinners, and the house white was a Chardonnay.  I don't like it, but hey, \"comes with it\" vs $9? No-brainer from whence I come.  Besides, my taste in wine has recently changed to less sweet, so I went with that.  Herb had a beer, which also was included.  (Nothing on the hibachi menu said anything about that).  We were told we could order anything up to the $32 combos, Our confusion was growing, and I went with chicken and shrimp, while Herb had the chicken and steak.  I really enjoyed the miso soup.  Has my taste changed again, or was this especially good?  I usually tolerate it, but don't love it.   The little side salad was cute, with curls of carrots from a Vegetti-like tool making it prettier, but it sure would have been messy on a first date.  Not our problem :) Our chef wasn't Japanese, but from the South Seas islands, and he put on an entertaining show.  He followed our instructions almost to the letter, using lower-sodium soy sauce and no extra salt; he slipped up only once, immediately offering to remake it, but it was the steak, and Herb's not as salt-phobic as I.     The food was all really tasty, including the fried rice, which we had also been told came with the dinner.  Curioser and curioser.  Until the bill came.  We'd already handed the guy our $25 coupon, and the bill now included the wine, beer, and one fried rice.    The mystery was cleared up quickly.  I was off taking pics when Herb was asked about the coupon.  I'll never know whether the man said \"coupon\" or \"Groupon,\" but apparently there's a Groupon out there that costs, I think, $49 for a complete dinner for two, and that wasn't ours!  Then, after he explained all that, he took the check back and, without us even asking, took off the drinks and the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> discount, and gave us the coupon back.  Checking <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> later, I saw that the latest Osaka coupon on that site doesn't even offer $25 off anymore, just, I think, $10.  That is Customer Service with a capital C, and that's why I've bumped it up one star to a 5.  A rare experience, and much appreciated. I could become a fan.",

You have to ask for it anywhere you eat sushi so remember my tip...ASK FOR FRESH WASABI! It'll improve your meal every  single  time. Anyway, Ozzie hooked us up. Across the board. Amazingly fresh fish, good conversation and all at a deal with our Groupon. Good service...and when you order a large beer, it's accompanied by a small sake. Are you kidding me right now?!

The customer service is greatly lacking as we waited 15 minutes for someone to come and take our order. While we wait, there's blaring music that deters us from actually having a conversation with people at our table. There's also food from a prior meal on my plate that I just can't ignore.

I was also charged an 18% services for a table of two like others. I don't mind tipping on the full original total but 15% not 18%.  The reason I really hated this experience was that the Sushi Groupon deal which we ordered (not Hibachi) was the worst Sushi I've ever seen. The plate was extremely small.  They were like miniature playtoy Sushi.  And they were misshapen like a child formed them.  Normally Sushi chefs take pride in the form.",

Basically they over booked the grill. And our only option was to move to the bar or force our friend to order on the fly. She then held us responsible for holding up the other party at the table. I explain that I would not be held accountable for their booking error. We made a reservation for 3. We let multiple people at the restaurant know we had a reservation for 3.

WOW really?  Who does that?    We had reservations for a birthday party and what a clustermess!  The whole time we were waiting Joy thought we were another party.  She didnt even have the reservations right.  She was telling my guests that I didnt make the reservation till that day-not True! There was a huge party/work presentation (scheduled for 6pm) going on in their room-scheduled for an hour when some of those guests were approaching the manager to \"just feed them\"-at this time it was 8:45pm.  Yes.  It sounds like a made up story but for sure its real.  To make a long story short we did end up getting reservations with the GEISHA HOUSE ON N. DECATUR and I must say the place was packed and they fit us right in.  Knowing what we had been through, they went over and beyond to make a bad situation right.  Top Class!  At the end of the night (which ended up being late due to starting late-the whole staff came out and gave the birhtday girl a birthday song to remember.  The chef and waitresses wer tipped well as our bill was well over $1500.  I've been a long time customer of Osaka and I think I am finally done going there.  It used to be the happenin place and it just has fizzled out.  I dont say often that I wont be back, but being what an embarassing and disappointing experience I can finally say that they will not get our business again.  BTW there wasnt even any heartfelt apologies.  So I apologize to you Joy for your unwillingness to make things right and yet one more bad review for you.  You had alot of first timers that definitely wont be back either.  Just looking at the other review I dont see how this place can recover and be what they were years ago.",

Waste of time, never been this irritated at a restaurant before. I would have walked out if I wasn't with my family.",

    "text": "We have been going to osakas for a few years now but the quality of the sushi bar has drastically gone down hill. We ordered a philly roll to start. When the roll came it was 8 pieces, each piece the size of a nickel. I have never had a philly roll so small before. The salmon inside had a brown tint to it, not the normal bright pink red you would expect. We ordered one more roll, which was meh and an order of 7 piece sashimi. Normally this would fill the two of us up but we're both starving. The facility was clean, had friendly service, and no wait but that's the only positive feed back I can give.",

First she said she was seating the party of 7 first then we were next but ended up seating a different party that we saw walk in after we did. She tried to lie and say that they supposedly had reservations.  The waitress came to take our orders and I asked for moscato and there's an additional fee of $3 but when I looked at the menu moscato was cheaper than the Chardonnay that their \"offering\" from the Groupon menu so it's just a total rip off.  I've been to several hibachi restaurants and this by far has been the worst I've ever been to. The service is beyond disappointing! They don't even offer water. I've never been to an establishment that function the way they do here. DO NOT BUY THE GROUPON OR COME TO THIS LOCATION !!!! You will regret it ! I will be reaching out to Groupon and filing a complaint about this business!",

Touching raw fish, bottles, door knobs - no respect for the guest experience/health. 2. Sushi dishes come with ginger and wasabi. Thats normal. Not here or at least not on our 3 plates of rolls. When we requested it, this guy stuck his hand into a metal tub of ginger, squeezed the juice of and plunked it onto the plate. I wouldnt eat that canned ginger if you threatened me. 3. We ordered 4 rolls when we came in. 3 came... another couple came in and ordered a ton of stuff. They got their whole order before we got our 4th roll and he hadn't forgotten. I asked cause i was ready to get out.  4. Manager came behind to help and also didnt wash her hands or use gloves.   Did i get sick after? Yes. Will i go back? No. Should you try it out? No. Do not buy a groupon for this place. Stay away.",

Agree with other reviews that food is overpriced (that is why mentioned coupon).  Good for 2 $32 menu for hibachi table. But, if you want something that costs more, there is a surcharge of $10-$17? I chose NY strip w/chicken and my Dad ordered, filet mignon.  Comes w/2 glasses either house wine or sake, w/soup, small salad 1 order of fried rice, asst. vegetables. Leah was our waitress and KK was our chef.  Soup broth was good, salad, ok.  2 shrimp for taste while watching chef cook. KK was nice. Garlic butter had no flavor. My Ny strip tough (cooked medium well instead of medium), filet was good. Ordered sushi roll w/eel. Rice was a little dry.  KK tried his best to be funny & his skills seemed like maybe needs to change because the chefs have been doing this for years. What is sad is restaurant needs a makeover. Place looks old, same couch now has a big hole in it. Bathroom toilet ready to explode! Just very sad because use to be a place where it was fun, food very good & nice. No happy hour. And, people do not look happy. Would go somewhere else for Japanese which the waitress did recommend a Thai restaurant ? Glad we had a coupon!",

We came here for brothers 18th birthday and to begin with we waited over THIRTY minutes just to get our drink order taken. the portions were tiny, the food was bad and under seasoned, and the hibachi chef was mean and cold. We repeatedly tried to engage with him to no avail. Then while eating my rice bowl I found a HAIR in my rice and after telling the OWNER he preceded to argue and raise his voice to us about it being impossible and telling us that we planted the hair ourselves. Needless to say we will never be back again. The food sucked, the service was terrible and we were treated terribly by the OWNER. Forget the Groupon and go to benihana instead.  And it should be mentioned that I work as a server so am overly kind and forgiving when eating out.",

Everything is an upcharge.  And not just the difference in price ( $32 entree) they charged an upgrade fee of $17. Ridiculous.  Our server started out attentive but because they're was another couple at our table, I feel that we got left behind ( maybe easier to cater to 2 than 6).  Our chef was a joke too. This was my third hibachi experience and this was the worst. Luckily my family didn't know any better. The only \"entertainment\" we got was the onion volcano and the spinning egg spatula flip thing. Which he messed up.  I can't even remember what we call ordered but the basic fried rice, shrimp,  chicken and steak and red snapper. Chicken was a little on the dry side. And the 2 sauce accompinents weren't great either. Steak was good but portion was terrible. They really need to work on plating evenly.  The only saving grace was the 2 side orders of sushi that we got.  I'm am very disappointed with the experience.  The restaurant was lovely tho and clean. Ambiance was nice.  Definitely will not be returning.. at least to this location and definitely without a Groupon.",

    "text": "We dined here for a friend's birthday with a groupon. It was fun, but the experience could have been better.  When we arrived we had reservations, but still ended up waiting a little while for a table. It was strange, because at this point most of the tables were empty and the restaurant was not busy at all. When we were sat at a table we immediately had to move to another table because apparently there was a mistake. The staff wasn't rude about it, but they weren't apologetic, either.   The groupon rules were confusing at best. I've never been to a restaurant that had such confusing hoops to jump through to use a groupon. (Your meal could only cost X amount, if you went over that you couldn't just pay the amount, you had to pay half of the cost of the entree extra, etc.) While the groupon was a great deal, it was made really confusing to use. It felt like a bit of a run around, which was annoying from a restaurant that was so expensive.   The food itself was delicious! Almost everyone at our table had the beef option and enjoyed it. The scallops one person ordered weren't as good as the beef option. And the chef was fun and entertaining, he did a wonderful job.   Overall, we had a fun experience. I definitely would have felt it was overpriced without the groupon that a friend had, but I don't think I would return considering how confusing the groupon was. So, it was fun but I don't think we will be back.",

Although the food was relatively good and the service by our waiter Robin was very good. The NY steak was very thin and tasted poor quality and I think they shrank the serving size of the shrimp which was also under cooked.   The real issue is the groupon situation was less then great. It says you can get any entree up to $32. The problem comes when the item you want is say $35 they don't charge you the extra $3 they want to charge an extra $10 or up to $17. What was the point of the groupon?   My opinion if you are looking for teppan go to Musashi on paradise or Hamada on flamingo you will be much happier.",

    "text": "Most awkward dining experience ever. My mother and I came to eat on a Monday night. There is a large party nearby but several empty tables so it is not super busy. I ordered a bento box, and mom ordered a roll of sushi. My bento box comes, and mom's sushi does not. The waiter comes by and apologizes a couple of times saying that they had a whole bunch of sushi orders come in at once. So I'm eating mine, because I don't want my food to go cold. I am a notoriously slow eater. I'm trying to eat even slower because essentially my mom is watching me eat. However, I am able to finish my WHOLE meal and my mom has not been served. She's a bit steamed and asks the waiter, is there something that is available \"now\"? He says he can get her a bento box like I had. She says ok. He comes back a moment later to ask if she wanted to cancel the sushi roll. Well duh that is the implication if you ask if you can order something else instead. Five minutes later, the manager comes out with the sushi roll. My now upset mom informs her that this was cancelled. The manager gets pushy saying \"can't you take it to go? I can't resell this.\" At that point we cancel the other box, ask for the bill, pay it and leave. As I'm paying the bill the server for the only time asks if we want a refill on the drinks. Um no, thanks.  This could have been handled so much better. If they were short handed they could have said that you could only order sushi from the sushi bar so that the dine in people would only order from the kitchen. They could have offered her a miso soup or fried rice so she would have something to do while waiting instead of watching me eat. They could have said at the beginning, look, sushi will take 45 minutes and mom would have ordered from the kitchen. I am glad they did not offer a discount for next time because there will not ever be a next time.",

Sam came back to the table and said the sushi chef did not like the look of the fish and didn't recommend it. They fixed me something else.   Negatives 1.  The food is overpriced for the flavor. Nothing exciting.  2.  I went for happy hour. The menu doesn't have a good variety. I hope you like martinis and rolls.  3.  All Osaka locations are definitely not the same, and this location is not the best of the bunch, as far as atmosphere goes.   Overall, if you're looking for a good sushi happy hour, go to Kona Grill.  MUCH better menu, pricing, and atmosphere.",

While dining an ant crawled off my sisters plate and when we told them about it they made it seem like we were making it up, however later on in the night more ants appeared on our table and when we told the sever she wiped the table down with a dish rag and went on with no care. For a meal that was over $150 I expected better service and a much cleaner atmosphere. If you're thinking of coming here maybe try Ohjah instead; cleaner atmosphere, tastier food, fresher sushi, and much better customer service.",

My favorite food from there is the Where's The Beef Roll which is like a shrimp tempura with steak on it. That roll is bu far the best sushi roll I have had in my life. Customer service is ok as well. There was ine time it took a long time to get our food to cooking on the hibachi grill but the wait was worth it and it gave me and companion more time to conversate so no big deal. Definitely worth visiting one time, and remember Where's The Beef Roll.",

    "text": "I have never in all of my 17 years in Las Vegas been treated with the amount of disrespect and abuse that occurred tonight. Our family will NEVER come back to this restaurant. We normally go to another sushi restaurant and we should have stuck with our regular place.... Here is what occurred... 4 people ordered sushi and 1 person ordered a bento box. The sushi came out and 20 mins later, after we were almost completely through with our meal, the bento box finally arrived. We mentioned it twice to the server. He was very nice and apologized but said there was nothing he could do because the kitchen was behind. We asked to speak to a manager. We started by complimenting the quality of the food and Dylan our server. But we told her how unsatisfactory it was that the person in our party was sitting with no food for the majority of the meal. Just watching everyone else eat is not fun. She apologized and said that should never have happened and she hoped it would be better next time. She then offered free dessert for the whole party of 5. My grandmother was getting tired and we needed to get her home so we thanked her for that offer but asked instead just to have the bento box taken off the bill. It was as if a switch in her was flipped. She turned into a monster for lack of a better word. The rest of the conversation was nothing short of embarrassing at that point. (For her not for us.) She loudly told us that she was the owner and she would not adjust the bill. To quote her, \"Did you eat the bento box?\" Yes he ate it. He was starving by the time it came. Then she said, \"I have chefs to pay and they make more than $10/hr so I can't be taking food off the bill that you ate.\" Huh? So you were going to comp dessert for 5 people but you won't credit $18 for a bento box??? For the OWNER to treat customers in such an abusive manner is ridiculous. We weren't a young rowdy group. We were there with our parents and grandmother. We were customers that deserved to be treated with respect. I insisted at that point that she take the money off the bill and she finally did after arguing and mocking me in front of other customers. When she looked at the bill and saw that we had a Groupon, she turned around and loudly said, \"You have a Groupon and you're trying to get something for free?\" That is not the point at all. A Groupon does not mean that we shouldn't get the same quality of service as someone else. And obviously the business is looking for new customers or they would not have offered a Groupon. She then came back and literally threw the bill down on the counter in front of me and told us, \"I hope you never come back here again.\" No worries there. And just for the record, Dylan was fantastic and we tipped him 20% in cash on the entire amount of the bill, including the full amount of the Groupon. So the owner cannot say that we were trying to be cheap. We were disgusted to say the least by the owner's behavior.",

The wine selection is beyond minimal to say the least. The manager at the time seemed too rushed and abrupt to really care about the service we received, from seating to ordering our dinner. The menus are laughable...a clipboard with laminated sheets with the choices. Seriously...invest in a menu. Then when the \"show\" began we found it too noisy. Honestly I've been to many teppan grills, and never had this complaint...maybe it's bad insulation? The food was mediocre at best, and that's being generous. I'm not one to give bad yelp reviews usually, but wanted to have an honest and helpful one among the rest.",

To Start, they took a last minute groupon reservation for us about 30 minutes before the kitchen closed. I know that doesn't sound like much but a lot of times I call in and get some attitude. The person on the phone was super friendly and accommodating.  When we arrived, he greeted us by name, (knowing that we would be in) and was a great host. We were seated and served drinks and waters very promptly. The service was amazing. The chef was entertaining and laid back. Made casual conversation and was very friendly.   Now to the best part. THE FOOD!!!! The food was fantastic. We ordered the hibachi and we got it. I ordered the steak which was cooked perfectly and my fiance' ordered the Scallops which were out of this world. The sake was fantastic and the overall scenery was perfect.   I highly recommend Osaka Japanese Bistro to anyone looking for a delicious meal with great service.",

    "text": "I was actually expecting more from this place :-(. Maybe the other location is better. First our ice green teas, my grandma tasted hers first and said it had no flavor :-(, I tasted mine and she was right. She asked the server if they could make it stronger but she never got around to it, (I think the whole night  she was a bit distracted she seemed like a nice girl but I'm sorry to say her service tonight was not the best :-( ) one of the other gentlemen, whom I think maybe was like the busses did however fix our green teas for us :-). I food took FOREVER to come OMG and we were getting so hungry. I ordered a California tempura roll, my grandma ordered their 007 roll w/ 2 pieces of nigiri w/ tuna & for my son a chicken teriyaki bento box. I was disappointed w/ my roll, most place I go it's pretty big and filling. The roll is always nicely breaded with the Tempura, at this place the tempura on the roll was really skimpy it basically looked just like a regular CA roll. The taste of it wasn't bad, it was decent but was not what I was expecting sadly :-(.and it only came w/ about 5 pieces, normally it's 8 :-(. My son and my grandma shared her sushi her roll looked pretty good and she said it was good but kind of small pieces. Her nigiri looked way smaller and skimpy as well to what we are used to :-(. My sons bento box was pretty good, we all nibbled on it, the chicken teriyaki was just ok, I've had better but the tempura was pretty good and I always love the salad with the Asian ginger dressing!!! We were all still hungry so I ordered just another CA roll and some Gyoza. The Gyoza was actually really good. Overall the taste of the food was not horrible but I've definitely been to better sushi places. They did let my son pick out a piece of candy from their little candy treasure chest which was sweet of them. I probably wouldn't go back since I wasn't wowed this time. Maybe my expectations were too high because I heard it was really good from some friends. :-(. But I have a couple more certificates to use for this place. Next time I'm going to try the hibachi, I'm thinking that's probably the way to go because I still left their feeling a little hungry :-(. I'll have to see what happens the next time.  I almost forgot to mention that at one point they said they had ran out of green tea for the night :-(, but towards the end they had some more so have us a couple more glasses. And I was not a fan of the menus. I didn't really get it at 1st, it's just a big clipboard with printed out papers, in the paper protectors, attached to it. It was the weirdest thing to me lol.",

Not terrible, just definitely not fantastic! They haven't been the best honoring specials/coupons and the service wasn't great on prior visits.   Tonight was different. We had the best Teppan Grill chef ever! Chef Ryan was funny and amazing at what he does! So skilled and didn't just have the same old tricks and jokes as most chefs do. Chef Ryan gets a five star for sure!! Our waitress, Daphne was also very nice and attentive. I would recommend making reservations to make sure that you sit at Ryan's table if you're going to come here!   The decor is all over the place! They have an awesome light fixture, but it just reminds me of something that should be in a Moroccan restaurant, not Japanese. Either way, I typically don't care that much about decor as long as the service, food and value is good. I'm only mentioning it because it was such a topic of conversation during dinner. Everyone else at my table seem to be so fixated on it.",

It took the waiter a very long time to get our order and when he finally did, it took almost an hour before the chef to come to the table to cook the meal. I was very surprised at the poor quality of the food and portion. Several of my family members ordered the ribeye and there was not much meat for them to eat. The salad was old. When the final bill came out for all 8 of us, it was over $380.00. There were several other restaurants nearby that we could have received better quality food for 1/4 the price. The female bathroom was in pretty bad shape. There was toilet paper on the floor and one of the toilets was clogged. Both doors had no locks on them. You could see right through the hole. The one nice part about this restaurant was the ambiance. The actual inside of the restaurant (except the bathroom) was very nice and upscale. The tables were clean and seating arrangement was cute.",

Don't go for happy hour though it is temporarily removed as they are making some changes to the menu  . I will definitely be back",

We paid $32 bucks for a piece of meat that was a little bigger than a poker chip and about 1/2 thick and this is no exaggeration. All there dipping sauces were watered down and tasted terrible. I guess there was a reason this was the only restaurant on Christmas Eve with availability, that should of been a red flag. What a joke. We will NOT be back!",

    "text": "So me and my mom were craving Japanese and we had yet to try this place so we decided why not...  The second we sat down I looked it up on yelp and I have to admit I was a little scared. So this is going to go like some of my other reviews. I'll divide this into 3 sections: vibe, service, and food. Let's go!!!  Vibe: Honestly, the second i stepped into the place its a bit hectic. There was a bar, a sushi bar, teppanyaki grills, and regular tables.With the decor and the set up it had a very chaotic feel to the place. Plus, the furniture looked like they thrifted it. A lot didn't match and there wasn't an overall theme.  Service: The service wasn't the downfall like some people warned. At least in our case anyway. Our waiter wasn't super attentive but he wasn't neglectful. He checked on us every once in a while.  Now the main event  FOOD: So we ordered gyoza for our appetizer and I ordered a salmon teriyaki bento box. To start, our waiter asked us how we wanted our gyoza. You have the choice of deep fried, pan fried, or steamed. We ordered pan fried and the texture was definitely more steamed. The wasn't any crunch to it. The bento came with salad, rice, 4 pieces of California roll, tempura, and salmon. The salad was very light on their sauce but you could taste sesame. The California roll was nice I had no complaints. Now the tempura I had a bit of a problem with... I'm a bit of a stickler for tempura and this was not OK. The batter was very light bit that wasn't my problem. My problem was that it was soaked in oil still. Some of my vegetables were even soggy. Lastly, the salmon I was disappointed in. The teriyaki sauce was nice. It wasn't to thick or overpowering so it was good. Sadly, my portion of salmon was a bit sad. If salmon was the main protein then I expect there to be a good amount but honestly they gave me a sliver.   Overall, not to bad of a place but I wasn't living for it.",

    "text": "Okay. So.  We've been here a bunch of times, and usually bring friends here when they visit, and generally love this place. However, tonight when we decided to head over because we hadn't in a while, we couldn't have known we were in for an incredibly unpleasant surprise. After waiting an hour for out 6pm reservations, we were finally seated at 7pm. We immediately ordered beer and sushi, and then got to work deciding on our entree. The waitress brought us sake, which we didn't order and refused to take it back when we told her it wasn't what we ordered. She eventually also brought us out beer. We both ordered the ribeye entree, with soup, salad, veggies, and fried rice. Our fired rice came out still mostly steamed, and we weren't even asked how we wanted our steals prepared. I spoke up after the chef put then on the grill and, despite asking for our steaks medium and medium-rare, respectively, we received well-done, flavorless steaks at the same time. Our neighbors, though having disclosed their respective allergies to mushrooms and shellfish, got both mushrooms and shrimp on both their players anyway. However, the chef did eventually correct this.   The sushi we ordered showed up luke-warm about an hour later (8pm), after having sat on the sushi bar for a good 20-30 minutes. We didn't eat it. I asked for the check and the waitress asked if we wanted a box. I replied \"No, thank you. It was terrible.\" And she just walked away. No one seemed to care that they were serving sub-par food in a sub-par manner. I asked to speak to a manager who conveniently was not there. We left without eating, but did pay for the food against our better judgement. There are plenty of hibachi places in the city. Trust me. Go somewhere else.",

Long story short, dropped about a hundred bucks on sushi and didn't find anything awesome or extra ordinary about it. When we entered we thought they were closed at first because we weren't immediately greeted. You know that awkward feeling walking in assuming they were actually closed and thay they just forgot to lock the door. That was us until someone came to greet us. We sat at the bar and chefs were friendly. It had a nice vibe to it. But even at happy hour price and the experience we had...i couldve dropped a hundred bucks down the road and walked out knowing I got my money's worth. Just wasn't impressed.  Over and out.  Probably my shortest review ever. Lol.",

We especially love sushi wrapped in cucumber. It is consistently fresh with a menu boasting something for everyone.   The service is on par.  I couldn't believe why the ratings are low. Each time we were here, we had good service and experience.  It has a pretty ambiance and I like their hip music. It's a fun place for a date or even a group.  The hibachi meals were served with miso soup, a salad, grilled vegetables, and rice.    I recommend people to this place for quality sushi and experience.",

    "text": "I consider myself rational and reasonable in most aspects of life. I drive a Honda Accord, I brush a full two minutes and floss twice a day, I eat at the free, but mediocre cafeteria at work every weekday. I'm no sushi snob or a vindictive Yelper.  So when I say that this was literally the worst Japanese food I've ever had, I really mean it. Everything, from it's run down 90s era greasy booths, to it's foul bathrooms speaks of it's fading mediocrity that makes a $20 AYCE sushi joint look like a Nobu Omakase feast in comparison.  We showed up at 630 on a Sunday evening, looking for something quick and easy for my wife and the two kids. As a general safety rule, I don't get sashimi at place that doesn't look 100 percent authentic and serious about sushi. This was more of a teriyaki and California roll type place.  I got the salmon teriyaki, my wife got the spider roll (because deep frying is a good sterilizer), my daughter got the chicken udon and my son got the caterpillar roll.  Somehow, this took 45 minutes to prepare what is basically Japanese fast food. The place was only half full, with a majority of patrons enjoying the teppanyaki (Benihana style) dinner.  Note: If anyone from the restaurant ever reads this, please stop calling that type of dinner Hibachi, which refers to a open grate grill. Obviously no Japanese person has ever stepped foot in your restaurant, so I suspect no one knows or cares.  Anyhow, the Spider Roll was amazingly dry to the point of the rice being crunchy. Perhaps the vinegar ran out at the restaurant. My wife called it, \"The worst roll she's ever had.\"  Nothing bad to say about the caterpillar roll. Hard to mess up on a California roll with avocado. My 7 year old loved it.  My salmon was predictably dry and soaked with a pool of syrup. They didn't include tempora sauce with the tempora, but they did give me extra teriyaki syrup.  Finally, the udon was nondescript. Other than the lack of adequate noodles in the liter sized cauldron it came it, it was edible.  Needless to say we will never be back. It's honestly amazing that this place still exists. Perhaps the 2.5 star rating and the fact that there were zero Asians in the restaurant except the Filipino bus boy should have tipped me off. Try Yummy Sushi in the next strip mall down the street on Lake Mead.",

Our reservation was set for 5:00 and they were running a little behind. We were seated by 5:30. It took a little while to get our orders and the dinner going. I was starting to get a little anxious.  However... Once our Chef came out, the entire evening & dinner was great!! They placed a Happy Birthday sign in front of my son and he got special treatment all night. The Chef let him try to flip the egg, engaged him in conversation the entire dinner and they even came out singing with big happy birthday signs and ice cream. Which was an awesome surprise for all of us. We weren't expecting that.  Our orders consisted of chicken, filet mignon, New York strip and lobster. We also ordered edamame and spider rolls as appetizers. Everything was really good and we didn't leave too much on the plate when we left.  Just as everyone's commented, if you order over the $32, the additional charge is $10 or $17, depending on what you order. But the hostess explained all of that to me before we even sat down.  Everyone was very friendly and the dinner ran smoothly, once the hibachi experience actually began. I actually liked the food better than the only other hibachi style dining I've been to before (Gesha House). I think we all agreed that we would definitely return, especially with another Groupon!!",

    "text": "This is going to be a difficult review to write, and most all, to read...especially if you are an employee or fan of Osaka Japanese Bistro Summerlin. This is a 2-star review for very clear and obvious reasons described below. Thank you to the Osaka Japanese Bistro Summerlin family for doing the best under such horrible circumstances, but let's face the facts as they exist:  A) The entry to this restaurant is a fire code violation. People standing around blocking the only restaurant entry/exit violates City Of Las Vegas fire code. And at any given time the entry/exit was booked by a dozen or more people. B) Bar staff sucked. I  arrived 15 minutes before 7pm for my reservation at 7pm, and was told by the Maitre D'ame to have a seat at the bar... 30 (tH1rTy) minutes later I got my first drink. C) It took 96 minutes.. Yes...Ninety Six minutes... To seat a party of two, and the bartender spoke to me twice: once to ask if I  wanted a drink, once to collect my bar tab. D) service sucked. Hint: if you are on a low-carb diet, ask for (steamed) rice... You'll never get any rice at all. I  finally got my water glass as I was -p-a-y-i-n-g- my bill.  R. U. Kidding. Me.",

    "text": "Disco music in a Japanese restaurant?  Does not work for me.  Also the decor is out of place.  The chandelier was more inline in a Moroccan restaurant but the disco music I have no clue why that is their choice of music in a Japanese restaurant. But the waitress also needs to be more aware of her duties. First she forgets to bring our water and my wife's hot tea.  Maybe she would have an excuse for forgetting to bring our water and hot tea if the place was busy, but when we arrived there was only two other table with one customer already finished eating the the other who was eating their food.  So there is no way she can say she was busy. We had to remind her once we finally got our food.  The food itself is average, but the food preparation leaves much to be desired. My wife and I both ordered the bento box which comes with Shrimp Tempura but her order came with two Shrimp and mine only had one.  Also the dipping sauce for the Shrimp Tempura was totally not adequate!  Just about an ounce of dipping sauce. If the waitress had any common sense, she would notice the portion for the dipping sauce was not enough and she should have at least asked if we wanted more dipping sauce.  But the sad fact is most food servers today are just going through the motion and I guess I should blame management for their lack of training also the chef or the cook who prepares the food should also have more intuition on the food they prepare. Only positive comments I have about this restaurant was the booth was comfortable.   I understand the waitress works for \"Tips\", but I still feel \"Tips\" should not be taken for granted and my initially reaction was to just give her maybe a dollar or five, but the bill was about $80 and I guess I should not put all the blame on her and I hope this posting will be read by management who will better train their staff.  I left her $20 because I felt sorry for her.  There is soo much other restaurants to choose from so I know I definitely will not return back to this place.",

Their staff is not only INCOMPETENT, they're rude, ignore regulars, but screw up order after order on sub-par food. I got past the hair floating in the sludge that was supposed to be tempura dipping sauce, but the ENTIRE order was wrong. For TWO people!!! We were ignored, my daughter chose this place against my better judgement, and tried to enjoy her teriyaki covered gristle so I'd be quiet which I did, when we left, one of the \"chefs\" was sitting at the bar enjoying his meal and chatting with the bar tender while I observed a couple waiting patiently for some service. They left, not served. There were 2 tables and a SUPER loud hibachi table going period. I want a job like that. Also... no TP IN RESTROOM. We seriously thought we'd try one more time. Ordered tempura to go. 2 orders with 4 dipping sauces. We got FOUR ORDERS AND 2 DIPPING SAUCES. The very next night. Just trying to give them another chance. Last time. Being 1/2 Japanese... I'll refer my friends to the ever changing food court Japanese fair at the mall. Shame on you!!!",

Another 10 minutes later with egg shells and all out it came.  So disappointed, it used to be an amazing off the strip sushi place. I had a Groupon that they wouldn't honor because it was $11.00 shy of the $80.00 minimum. (After sushi chief tip and waiter tip) geeze I thought it would have been well used. We used to leave with a good buzz after beer and saki, not even slightly. I don't think we will even be back to use it.",

The server came back with 2 lemon raspberry drops, i told her we ordered one of each but she said I had to give one drink back after drinking it in order to get my blueberry which I did. We ordered our food and the hibachi chef came out, and he barely knew what he was doing. We were the only people in this part of the restaurant so I know it wasn't because they were busy. He barely spoke to us at all and he didn't really make the time entertaining. he just cooked and left right away.   The place looks super run down. Theres water damage all in the ceiling, the servers dress uprofessionally, our server had knee high Spiderman socks on and booty shorts. Not the best professionalism for a\"high end resturant\"  I wanted to try a different drink other than the raspberry lemon drop so I ordered the lychee martini, which was horrible, so I asked to exchange it for the raspberry lemon drop and I was told I couldn't do that or I would be charged for all the drinks, even though I only took one sip out of the lychee martini.  Overall this place is HORRIBLE! We sent a good amount of money for a mediocre  (if even) experience.  Don't waste your money here.",

I don't have too much experience eating fish, so I had to ask the waiter a lot of questions about the menu.  He actually spent a lot of time explaining things to us and making suggestions.  Also, he preemptively asked us whether we had any other plans (which we did), and ensured that we were served in a timely manner.  We ordered four or five dishes, including various sushi and sashimi dishes, as well as several cooked dishes, I will say that the sashimi is definitely the best I have ever had in the Summerlin area,  Excellent ambience, service, and food.

First of all there is a lot of food that had  no prices on the menu ex. appetizers, salads, soups,  and green tea.  Secondly, I ordered shrimp tempura which never arrived to my table.  When questioning the waitress, she said the other waiter forgot.  She showed me a receipt for $39.51 minus my $15.00 from my coupon. All that we had to eat was some salads, soup and some tofu.  The only thing they did bring out that was satisfactory was citrus salmon for my daughter.  For $23.00 and a small tip, we left feeling starved.  As I arrived home my stomach started to bother me.    I would not suggest this place for sushi to anyone.  I also noticed that the whole place was empty.  I wish I would have read yelp before wasting a $15.00 coupon on this scam of a place place.",

The sushi was tasty, but the rolls are really small; like they rolled it up real tight or something. There was about 8-10 pieces, but the roll itself was small. Does that make sense?

Hibachi cook made a joke with the other customers and made us uncomfortable. We asked for a manager and no one was available. The only restitution was offering us a dessert. Really?  U have ANTS in ur food and you offer more food.  Then the server said I would get a discount and that never happened.    Will never ever go there again and I don't recommend it to anyone to go there",

We sat for 5 minutes with being acknowledge by anyone. We decided to see if there was two free seats at the sushi bar. We ended up moving ourselves to the bar. Once at the bar the sushi chef greated us and we had placed our food order before even being greeted by a severe.  If it hadnt been for the fact that my boyfriend was craving sushi we would have left. Horrie customer service.  Not sure ill return to this location.",

The food and the service are good but as we received our check, I showed my $10.00 of coupon from my phone . The waitress said,\" oh let me ask my manager first\". She goes and talks to her manager and comes back and tell us that since we have our entree split , they are going to charge us $10.00 . so there is no discount , is even .  I can't believe they would do that. First they ask a coupon, then they take it back , as no one ever said about splitting charge?  It is not about the money , but it's about the principal . If the $10.00 worth more than my loyalty then i Will bring my business somewhere else. Obviously there are way better restaurant to go to in this town",

We have eaten here many times but recently not only has the menu changed (not for the better) but so has the dedication to excellence in presentation and flavor.  Invariably, the sushi rolls fall apart!  This has happened the past 3 times we have visited.  They are not being rolled properly and with care.  We mentioned it to our server twice.  The flavors are being diluted and the quality is just not the same.  I would hate to cross this off our list but we are certainly considering this option.  Very sad.",

    "text": "While the food was delicious, this place lost a customer.  I had previously dined at this place twice before and paid the full price. However, this time around I purchased a Groupon. Unfortunately, this place is extremely sneaky and they knew exactly what they were doing with the pricing structure.  With the Groupon, you are allowed up to $32 / entree under the hibachi experience. But virtually every hibachi entree is priced slightly over $32. I wanted the rib eye and shrimp which was priced at $35. I asked if I can pay the $3 difference. I was told that the upcharge would be $17!! So I figured out a work around. I ordered the chicken and New York steak for $30 and added shrimp for $12.  I really didn't mind, because i wanted the chicken anyway. Every other place that accepts Groupons will allow you to pay the difference in price. Keep in mind, I already purchased the Groupon. I didn't get that for free so this place still made money.  When the bill came for the 2 of us, they automatically added on the 15% gratuity. This is normally done with parties of 6+.  Too bad they lost me as a customer due to their sneaky pricing. I would rather pay a few bucks more on the Groupon and be allowed up to $40 for food and/or pay the difference for anything over.. I would love to see a managers response to this.",

Then I decided to confront her and she was completely rude and was basically arguing with me!! In front of everyone and was trying to make me pay for a roll I never  got. I felt as if she was trying to keep me in the restaurant and not let me out. She said the since the roll arrived at my table I need to pay !! I said I will not pay for it.

Osaka had some pretty harsh reviews but I didn't notice any of the flaws mentioned by other Yelpers.  We tried the Avatar roll, Tempura roll, and 007 roll. All three had shrimp tempura in some capacity and they were all fairly tasty. The tempura roll was definitely the most interesting because it was a normal roll that was actually tempura battered. It was definitely something interesting that I've never had.  The service was a bit lacking but not enough to mark it down a star. The prices were fairly standard to a bit high but nothing that would turn me off going here for some above average sushi. At least it was fresh, right?",

I would like to vent on here and warn others to save them from wasting their time, energy and hard earned money at this place. First it took 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge we were even there. I had to have a busser call our waitress where it took her another 15 minutes to get our drinks. It's now 8pm (we were seated at 7:30) they supposedly only had two cooks for the whole restaurant for the night so we waited. While waiting, I physically had to switch out our plates with the next empty table because they were dirty and greasy. I had to tell two bussers for them to pull the dirty plates out. So now its 8:30 and our cook comes..food was decent..Joe was pleasant. The only part of our visit we enjoyed. Ana our waitress was okay, she tried but we had a hard time understanding her and she obviously had a hard time understanding us since a few things were wrong with our order. I asked for a manager who I refused to speak to because this lady had the worst attitude the whole night. She has no manners and was very rude our whole visit. I didn't waste time getting her name, all I know is she has a gap on her front teeth. Whoever hired her should be ashamed. The man I spoke to took a few minutes to get to me and had nothing much to say but I didn't want my money back or anything else at that. I will never come back to Osaka or any other branch that they have and I will make sure everyone I know will not either. Pure waste of the 200$ plus that was spent. Maybe if you fix your staff you wouldn't need the groupons.",

    "text": "THIS PLACE IS AN ABSOLUTE RIP-OFF!!  My wife and I dined here on Sunday August 9th. We purchased a $49 for a hibachi dinner for two ($86 value) from Groupon which included: *Two hibachi entrees (up to a $32 value each) *Two house drinks, including wine, draft beer, large house sake, or well drinks *One order of fried rice. (Not a bad deal)   As soon as we arrived, the reservations we made directly on their website for 6pm was not in their system. Luckily enough they were not busy and there were 2 seats available. After being seated we waited a good ten minutes before a server came to our table. While waiting we noticed the temperature near the grill area was uncomfortably high.   After our server arrived we informed him that we had a Groupon and he let us know what that entailed. We each ordered a drink and received our miso soup & mixed green salad. We both decided on New York Steak & Shrimp for our dinner which is $34.00 ea. (Only $2.00 ea. over the  Groupon limit) Overall the dinner was pretty good. Our chef wasn't very engaging but he seemed friendly enough and made a few jokes through-out the meal.   After dinner was finished we received our bill. We noticed a $34.00 \"UPCHARGE\" attached to the bill. After asking our server about it, he told us the charge was for going over the $32.00 limit and he'd talk to the Manager about it. When he came back he informed us that this was their policy and there was nothing that could be done about it. We asked to talk to the Manager directly who came to our table (wearing a classy pair of shorts and t-shirt) He too informed us that the $34.00 ($17.00 ea.) was the restaurant's policy for going $4.00 over the Groupon's limit. I asked where the policy was written and told us it was not but it was the \"owners Policy\". At no time during ordering did our server tell us there would be any kind of upcharge for going over the limit. We assumed that we would only be charged the balance of the meal. There was nothing posted on the Groupon or the menu that there would be any kind of upcharge for \"Specialty Items\". Had we been told while ordering we would've certainly kept our order under the limit. I have no problem adhering to the policy if it would have been posted in any way. Unfortunately it was not.  I believe this was a blatant attempt by the owner to deceive its customers for the cost of an entire meal. Because of this I strongly recommend NOT going to this establishment.",

The four of us wanted the teppanyaki style dinner and we were seated with a couple that had been waiting at the table for 50 minutes! I felt so bad for them. Management should not make people wait that long at a table just because they want to try to fill it. The restaurant was hot and muggy because the AC was broken, and the couple saw a fan nearby and turned it on. We tried ordering the stuffed jalapeno appetizer but the waiter told us we had to ask the chef for that. The chef came out, didn't greet anyone, and just repeated what we had ordered. He also presented us with a bowl of sliced jalapenos and asked us how we wanted it cooked. We explained that we didn't want a side of jalapenos, and that we wanted the appetizer that was offered on the menu. The waiter apologized and brought the correct menu item later. The chef then attempted some kind of flame trick, but because of the fan, couldn't get the flame going, and just gave up. We had a newbie in our group and we were excited to show them all the chefs' fun tricks, but that did not happen. Anyway, we thought the chef would have just continued with some other flares like the beating heart shaped rice, or the banging with the tools thing, but he actually didn't do any of the fun tricks and just cooked the food, while telling us that he hated cooking. We were so disappointed. I just ate my food, which thankfully, tasted good, and ignored the guy. My friends and I couldn't believe how bad this chef was. Even if he didn't do any of the tricks or flares, the least he could have done was not tell the whole table he hated cooking!",

Here is the negative so strong that I will never again go there. As my reviews sometimes state, I'm a big fan of Groupon. I try many, many new places because of it and I eat out far more than the average person. But anyway, I went to take the kids (14, 20, and 21 year old friend) for their amazing sushi platters and since we're all really big sushi fans, I was happy to show them this place. I let the server know I had a Groupon and wanted to order the sushi platter, she informed me that they no longer accepted those for the platters. I showed her the details they themselves had posted and she brought the owner. I hear she is the daughter of the owner of the original Osaka. I explained what the situation is and she said she will not honor it because she has been meaning to change that on the Groupon page. Normally they'll just honor it, admit their mistake, then move on. She became really argumentative to the point of being offensive. Had it not escalated to that, I would have just not used the Groupon and that would have been the end. As a side note, it now states not valid on platters. Sadly, I have heard of other horror stories on the reviews with Groupon use, mostly on the tepanyaki side. I do not understand why these businesses enter into a partnership with groupon to get new business then proceed to treat those using them badly. It's not even that much of a discount. I paid $26 for $40 worth of food and the platter is $90, not counting drinks and appetizers. Like I said, I eat out a lot so $14 here and there really adds up but I am by no means getting a free meal. Plus, I always tip on the full amount. Again, the food was really good, the servers were good, but the management could really use a lesson on customer service.",

Three of us were seated where there was only room for two people.  It took a long time before we were even asked what we wanted to drink.  The Groupon appears to be a good deal but you really can't get the full value.  It's deceiving because the menu pricing only truly includes a few lower priced items and if you want to upgrade, there's additional cost (penalty fee).",

They ask if you want fried rice or white rice, and they don't let you know that they are going to up charge if you choose the fried rice. The rice was unbelievably salty, the steak tasted like New York steak versus the filet mignon it was supposed to come with. The lobster looked as though they bought langostino lobster in bulk at Costco. We ordered two appetizers, shrimp tempura and fried scallops. The tempura was nothing special, 5 stringy pieces of tempura mostly bread about a quarter of it shrimp. I think the only thing worthwhile was the fried scallops, those were good. We ordered two bowls for the kids one chicken and one steak, let's just say your better going to teriyaki madness for 8.95 you get a teriyaki bowl filled with meat rice and vegetables. Our waitress was nice as was the young hostess, aside from that I'd have to say this is the worst place to have hibachi in town. Our total bill was 116.00 WITHOUT alcoholic beverages, and we left still feeling hungry.",

The big show included an onion volcano and fried rice in the shape of a heart... That's. It.

We did the hibachi style, I have dined this way several times and I must say, the chef to a great job, entertaining as well as meeting my husbands dietary restrictions.   The decor is modern, and nicely decorated.   House red wine was $9 per glass not bad.  We each had steak and chicken with the usual veggies, food was very tasty, tender steak and chicken.  Part of the fun of this style dinning is sharing a table with others, this can be both good and bad,  this time not so good, their kids were well behaved and polite but the grown ups not so much.  The reason for the the four stars is having a 730 pm reservation and not getting started to 8:45, they only had one chef for 4 tables.",

So there are several menu items at the 34-36 dollar price point (2-4 dollars over the 32 dollar per person groupon) if you want those instead they will charge you 17 dollars per person. They also automatically include an 18% gratuity in the bill which normally would have been fine. But the waitress we had was more interested in hanging out with her boyfriend at the front sushi bar instead of servicing her customers. The chef also didn't seem to be very engaged as there was none of the usual flair you get at a hibachi place. All that being said I am disappointed that I spent money on this.  I would have gladly paid full price to get better service elsewhere.",

The cook had a nice personality which was his saving grace because my husbands steak was very discolored before it even began to cook. If it wasn't for the fact we had already bought and paid for a groupon for this place we would have got up and left. I was even upset I paid the amount I paid on Groupon for the food. I didn't even know hibachi food could be bland. It was so bad we just paid what we had to pay for the difference and left. So bad we didn't even say anything.

    "text": "What a bizarre experience. Was so looking forward to a great night with an entertaining chef to cook the hibachi. What we got was someone who appeared rusty and kept making Korean jokes in a Japanese restaurant.  As for the food. It was okay. The ice tea was very interesting in a great way. It almost had a nutty creamy flavor to it but it was tea. The miso soup was good. It was perfect temp for me because I don't like  food too hot but for anyone who expects hot soup, you will be disappointed.  For our entree we had the seafood medley and surf & turf. The menu says it comes with white rice and you can order a side for $4 however we all chose fried rice and the addition to the bill was $3.50.  You would think you were saving a buck until you continue to read down the bill and discover they are charging you $17 as an up-charge as labeled. This was very interesting because when we walked through the door of the restaurant they asked us if we had any certificates. When we said yes we had a Groupon, it was taken immediately.  Upon seating us we were told the Groupon was good for an entree up to $32. We have used many Groupon's  before where they have just taken the difference between what you order and how much they a lot for a meal. In our case both meals would have been $5 each. When we questioned and asked to speak to a manager, there was no one there so the server had to call. She came back and offered us $10 per person for the up charge. When I said no I wasn't going to pay that as it was never written anywhere or stated to us there would be an up charge she let me know her manager said she would have to call the police. I asked her to please do so and with that she went in the back to \"call her manager\" and came back out with a bill for the correct amount.  It's a shame that this type of funky business has to go on. Had it not been for the intentional overcharge, I would have given the food a three star rating. It was good, not great, not bad but man what a sad experience.",

We didn't end up getting seated until close to 8pm.  Once we got to our table, we had difficulty with our waitress. We ordered drinks and sushi as an appetizer. I had to ask for my drink 20 min later because the waitress forgot. Our sushi NEVER came.   We got the groupon deal two dinners up to $32 each. If you want to order a meal over $32, it's a $17 fee (which is ridiculous).   The miso soups arrived an hour and 15 min after our reservation time and the hibachi chef didn't start until an hour 45 min after our reservation time.  And to top it all off, when we asked to speak to the manager, we were informed that the manager wasn't there tonight. NO ONE was in charge.... and I'm not surprised based on the service we received.    I wouldn't recommend this restaurant location to anyone.

Without reservations it is hard to get in around dinner time.  As for the food, I've tried the chicken, steak, and shrimp hibachi plates. All are really good, but the shrimp is by far my favorite. Also, if you like sticky white rice, they have really good sticky rice (and I'm really picky about rice). They serve more than enough food--salad, soup, veggies, rice, and meat.

We came to Osaka hoping for some hibachi birthday fun. It was anything but that. It was a rushed and awkward experience. Our guy had zero enthusiasm, seemed bored beyond belief, cracked egg shells when he attempted the egg trick, all the while never able to crack a smile. Never spoke to any of the guests at the table. Spilled stuff, knocked the onion volcano over.. and so on. None of that matters when the personality is there though and some enthusiasm. But this guy was miserable and the experience became miserable. This group dinner of silence from hell was the worst $100 plus I ever spent on a meal for two. Quality of food was so so. The lobster was great. The chicken.. shrimp and everything else was over cooked and dry. Felt very rushed and it was painfully obvious the turn over rate was high and they just wanted us in and out. Would never go back.",

We went 10 people for the hibachi experience, some of us order from the menu - while everybody done eating I call the manger and ask politely when we're going to get our meal ?!  The manger told me \" we are very busy and you get you're meal when it's ready\" out of nowhere the guy was completely a dick !  I said excuse me?! That's not the response I expect from a manger !! And then he respond - I refuse to serve you!  Me and all 10 of us were in  shock!!  Of course we got up and left  . And I feel like the guy was racist, I can't find any reason to behave like that specially when you are the manger. I'm going with that to the BBB and to the local newspaper. People need to know about it. So make sure if you black, Hispanic , jewish you might going to Expiriance the same things. And by the way, we had piece of metal in one of our plates... We're eating in a lot of restaurants and we never had this kind of disrespectful experience",

    "text": "Got a Groupon to check out this sushi/Japanese place in the lake Meade/Summerlin Area. It was pretty dead inside maybe two groups of hibachi and 1-2 tables. To me I'm learning that's usually a sign. I HATE waiting for tables and I hate lines..however sometimes it's a sign of what's good. Anyway-The edamame came with literally no salt so I asked for some sea salt & awhile later he comes up with a regular salt shaker and said he had to refill it. Soo you don't use \"sea salt\" for edamame and you only have ONE container of salt I the entire restaurant? I'm confused. The pods weren't even hot or steaming sorta like warm but we were starving so we ate some. I usually eat them all but I only had a few. The potstickers were decent but the sauce was super salty. Just FYI. The shrimp tempura roll was eh...it had seaweed on the outside which we didn't like. The combination-chicken shrimp meat fried rice was ok but we could t pinpoint the flavor of it. Sorta of sweet. We decided it was ok but wasn't worth coming back especially without a Groupon. I'm beginning to think maybe places that are struggling are on Groupon...it's not always the case but lately it seems like the places are just \"ok\" I don't mind paying $$ as long as it's amazing and I don't feel like I could probably make it better at my house lol. I'm no chef but come on where are all the hidden gems in Vegas?! To sum it up...I'm gona give it an Eh...sorry just not worth the drive. I'm being nice with \"3 stars bc I'm in a good mood-it wasn't horrible the decor was nice but you don't go there for nice wall sconces you go for the quality of the food.",

My husband and I had a night without kids and decided to go to dinner.   We arrived around 7pm and parked right up front, which made me think why weren't they busier for a Sunday evening.  When I opened he door, I saw several signs that had missing letters and showed their age.  The hostess promptly greeted us and asked if we wanted to dine habachi or regular.   We chose regular.   Seated at a booth we ordered two chicken teriyaki Bento boxes, a Philli Roll and their Virgin Roll.  As we waited we began to look around and the signs weren't the only thing showing their age.  The upholstery had stains, the wood framing had chips and we overheard another guest say it was extremely hot at their seat and they smelled gas.  The habachi grills were full but there was only one other couple in the restaurant besides us.    The rolls were delicious!   But the Bento box wasn't. The salad had too much ginger and the chicken was very tough.  Tasted like it was thawed in a microwave.  My Sprite tasted watered down so I stuck with water.   Our waiter was very nice and brought another piece of chicken.  It took awhile to come from the kitchen so I took it to go and haven't had it yet.  Not sure why it took so long since habachi cooks their own food and there was just us ordering from the kitchen because the other table had sushi.    If we go back it'll be for the sushi only.  But honestly,it seems pricey when there's so many AYCE places nearby.",

She isn't overbearing nor does she ignore you. She has struck that perfect balance.  Our chief for hibachi was EJ. He kept good conversation going and gave special attention to a little girl at our table whom was celebrating her bday. (Which is a good thing.) With this, he did not neglect his chef duties as the red snapper I got was juicy and not dry at all. This shows talent with good customer service skills.  What prevents this from being a perfect is i did notice a few cosmetic issues. A couple of chips in paint on the walls. Far from rundown though.  I would recommend this place to readers as it does hit good service, good food, good atmosphere, and (while not perfect) a decent cleanliness :)",

I might mention that the host was also the bar tender and was clearing tables. Understaffed maybe? Very tight restaurant. The chefs at our table and the next we're back to back. Often touching. We sat on the end. Glad we did. People seated in middle against the wall were way to close. Uncomfortably close. Food was excellent. Portions were on the smaller side. I usually have left overs when I go to these steak houses. If I didn't have a Groupon this wouldn't have been worth it. Okay so the Groupon: Everyone in the restaurant had the Groupon deal lol! The Groupon is misleading it says $32 dollar entree. The only $32 entree is Chicken and shrimp. If you get steak or something different there is an additional $17 charge. So you go to a steak house and can't get steak with the Groupon offer. Drinks: Groupon states wine, beer, well drinks, sake, or soda. Nothing on the wine list works with Groupon. They have one house wine you can choose. So I went with a well drink. Cranberry Vodka. It was good. They didn't skimp on alcohol. Our chef Ken was very funny. Very talented. He did cuss several times. Seemed unprofessional to me. Also this is supposed to be a higher class restaurant and one of the waitresses had on booty shorts with tall basketball socks (see photo). I would almost give this place 2 stars. The food is just good enough I went 3 stars. I wouldn't go back and I will not recommend to friends and family. I will suggest an alternate restaurant.",

Although we were told a few times that a table was being cleared for us. I think that was their way of keeping us calm. I would have preferred the honesty of knowing things were backed up and it would be awhile.  Once seated, it took between 10-15 mins for someone to come and take our drink orders and another 20 mins before getting the appetizers that came with the meal. Shortly after we got our appetizers, the chef came to start preparing our food. I can definitely say it's solely because of him why my review is 3 stars instead of 1!   He was very personable and funny. His food was all seasoned very well and tasted even better. He definitely saved the night for us. Being nine months pregnant, if I knew ahead of time we would have to wait that long, we would have went somewhere else. Purchasing the Groupon kept us there!",

They also have a tacky reviews cabinet when you walk in like a kindergarten room display!   They also don't honor the difference of the Groupon if you want something over 32 dollars. I got the filet and then added on lobster for 14 dollars. I only got 3 tiny pieces of lobster! The place is run down and old, the walls look dirty and need a fresh coat of paint.   The happy birthday things they use are tacky and dirty too! The birthday girl at our table looked mortified. The only positive thing was our cook. He was super nice, did a good job cooking the food and was enthusiastic. He deserves to be at a place that takes care of their venue. Someone call Gordon Ramsey or restaurant takeover. The only reason we left a good tip was for him and we've both worked service type jobs in the past.",

We were sat at a table and after waiting a while, were asked to move for a big party. It took a while for our order to be taken, and while getting out soup and salad, we had to wait for a separate party of 5 to order and get their soup and salad before the chef came out.   The chef was excellent and really made our son feel special. My son loved the experience. However, by the time the meal was done, they had never brought us our 3 sides of white rice, and an order of fried rice. We had only a small portion of meat and vegetables. We told our server after they took our plates, and said that we were not going to ask them to bring it out, and just eat rice. They offered free dessert, but we were hungry for actual food,  and also had dessert waiting at home for us. They did make an order for us to take home. On the takeout, they didnt include the white rice again.   We left hungry, annoyed and our anniversary dinner was a waste. They were preoccupied with the large party that came in, and didnt provide much attention to us. We would probably not go here again. At the end of the experience, it was a huge disappointment. I really wanted to this work out well, but no good.",

I don't know if it's the same ownership or not but the sushi selection at this location is sub-par to the one on sahara. the rolls sold at the OG osaka are more appealing and taste better than most of what we had at this location. that's not to say the food here is bad; the sushi tasted okay and the calamari was good. it appeared as though osaka summerlin is more well known for its hibachi tables. the environment can get a little more noisy than your typical sushi restaurant so keep that in mind. the service was pretty good so overall it's a passable 3/5 for me dawg",

I wish I remembered our chef's name - I want to say it was Mark or Ryan. Regardless, he was absolutely great and personable, and it made our experience that much better. He was funny and incredibly skilled, and joked around a lot.  The food was incredibly delicious, and our chef made sure to cook it to everyone's preference. He also gave us some extra items, which was appreciated.   The only reason I am not giving it 5 Stars is that it took a while before any service started, and there wasn't very good phone reception where we were seated. This made it hard to pull up the Groupon that we had purchased.",

We came back with a reservation a couple days later. We were seated right away but waited 30 minutes for soup and salad, then 30 more minutes for the cook to come. The cook rushed through the cooking and the food had hardly any flavor. I put yum yum sauce on everything to make it taste good! Even the molten cake desert didn't taste good. We are frequent teppenyaki eaters, at different locations. I was very disappointed and will not return to Osaka ever again!",

I am not a sushi expert but I was with a Hawaii group that are. It's my girlfriend's favorite food and she is a foodie and knows her sushi. Boy was I surprised. They loved it and I loved it too. We had a plethora of dishes and all were \"give me more\" good. The plating was awesome. The dishes really were art worthy. Our servers were attentive but not intrusive. When we needed something they were there. When we didn't want an interruption they weren't.   In addition to the great food, I highly recommend the cucumber martini and blackberry margarita. Creative and flavorful. Two thumbs up to the mixologist.   Don't believe the haters. This place is worth a try!",

I was then scrolling on Groupon for something unrelated & saw the Osaka Hibachi Groupon. It's around the corner so thought we'd go there instead since I am not one to pass up a good deal. From the get go, the server looked like he was in a bad mood. He then asked if I had a Groupon which wasn't a problem until I saw he didn't ask anyone else. It was a struggle to ask him for anything & even then, he seemed annoyed. One of the times that I asked for something, he really told me to hold on because he had to help out other people.. who had gotten there after us, by the way. He then asked me if I wanted another order of rice as it was only $4 (could be $3) but the way he said it was off. Why offer groupons if you're gonna make us feel less than for using them? The group that got there after us were brought out waters& then were brought out drinks before we even got our drinks & I had to ask for him to also bring out water when he did it for them without even asking. The cook was awesome up until I saw he literally put all the food on the left side where the other group was. It was like we didn't exist. I want to think it was because we had a Groupon and not because we were Hispanic and the other group was white. I debated overtipping just to make him think twice about treating other people differently over Groupons or race or whatever he was treating us different for, but then thought that the service sucked so why would I & only tipped 10% which will probably make him continue to treat people differently based off of whatever problem he had. We then went to Musashi last night & the service & food was way better even though it's on a weird side of town.",

The location is in a good area in Summerlin and the place is newer and cleaner than the one in Sahara.  I usually get the ribeye, which includes rice, miso soup, salad, and a few pieces of shrimp.   The chefs cook in front of you, and the show is always fun to watch.  Depending on which chef you get, sometimes they ask for group participation too!  It's fun when you have a group.  The portions they serve are more generous than the portions I've seen in other teppanyaki / hibachi (table cooking) restaurants.",

We arrived on June 26th at 11:30 am. We were the first diners. We were seated quickly, and our waitress was great. I ordered the lunch beunto box. It was delicious. We also ordered the \"Willie Roll\" which Willie Diegel created on the show. It was very good. Another male employee checked on our table several times and refilled our drinks. I did not like how the menu was on a clipboard in plastic sleeves, and neither did Willie Diegel. We were talking about how good the food was but was concerned that when we left an hour later, we were still the only customers. As we were leaving, we noticed Osakas parking lot only had one car in it, and it was ours. The restaurant next door's parking lot was packed with cars. Overall, our experience was great but was very concerned that no one else was there. It makes me believe that the restaurant's reputation has not improved since being on Restaurant Steakout..",

We arrived early and had to wait at the bar for 10 minutes (with no-one else at the bar,) to be served a drink. Checked in for dinner when the whole group arrived (5:50 for a 6 pm reservation,) only to be told they had 4 reservations and we were not one of them, and only one chef. We waited and at 6:30 were told again that they did not know how much longer the wait would be. At 6:50, we asked about the wait (still the only guests waiting) and were told again that they only had one chef working and they didn't know how long it would be (maybe 15 minutes, or it could be more.) WE LEFT and went to another Japanese Steakhouse where we were greeted with open arms and great food, service, and a birthday gift! SOME BUSINESSES WANT YOUR BUSINESS AND MONEY AND SOME DON'T!

    "text": "Moving to this area recently, I decided to try Osaka on Lake Mead last Friday. I noticed an advertised happy hour special, so I thought it would be a good deal to take my two sons for an early  sushi dinner. I was very wrong. My family and I will not return to this business due to the following:   1) The short haired brunnette waitress/server who seated us was inattentive and somewhat surely in her demeanor. In fact durin our experience another party was seated at the sushi bar and after some dialogue (could not hear it) and some negative body language she was exihibiting, the party of three left abruptly. 2) The short haired brunette server/waitress was not concerned with our drinks or refills and we went long periods waiting for refills or even for her to ask if we needed anything. 3)The short haired waitress/server did not at any point offer any incentives nor suggestions for special food prices or kitchen specialties. She never asked us if we wanted anything from the kitchen, she never asked us if we were satisfied or needed anything else.  4) We waited at least 15 minutes total after our places were cleared of used dishes, to recieve our check, and then have the check serviced and change returned... 5) for three people, one order of sake and two ice teas, two colas and sushi (of any kind)  the bill was $120!!! -- during a \"happy hour\" and being the only people during this time @3:30pm this is a ridiculous price. No one offered to give us a deal, encourage a special or make recoomendations for a better pricing for our visit.  6) The two sushi chefs were not busy, but were also less than attentive and we frequently had to call him (only one was paying attention or greeted us) over to continue ordering rolls. 7) The 8-10 dollar rolls contained only four pieces compared to everywhere else (in the valley) that have eight piece rolls. The presentation of the \"specialty rolls\" was plain and unremarkable. The fish was of adequate freshness and taste, but that was undershadowed by the overall experience.     As you can see I numbered the complaints and I consider this order of importance as the server/waitress was the first and most disappointing impression upon your establishment. Frankly, for a business to steeped in the  upity \"Summerlin\" area of Las Vegas, I am saddened to report I get better service, better prices and no less important, a better quality food product in North Las Vegas establishments.",

My favorite is hamachi and I can tell that it is not the frozen kind that most corner sushi places serve. Their service has always been great and the place has been tastefully redecorated.  I bring my office staff to hibachi and they enjoy it every time. The quality and value has not changed inspite of the growing competition that eat-all-you-can places throw out to unsuspecting palates.  I just wish they serve uni more frequently.",

I ordered the Seafood Medley (39.95) tiger shrimp,  scallops, and lobster. It comes with vegetables., salad and white rice. I upgraded to the fried rice. I was disappointed to find out fried rice wasn't automatic like most places. It was good but they would come in third with Geisha Steak house and Ohjah in the lead. The scallops were better at Ohjah.  They lacked in taste here. The guy putting on the show was cool though!

Dafne is very rude and host that refused to give her name is also rude as a manager at a restaurant I'd never have staff like this these 2 girls they make this restaurant look bad not sure how this place has business with staff like this also quality of food definitely went down it didn't have any flavor I definitely will not be coming back to this place hopefully \"management\" that both girls said is never there puts a stop to their attitude unless that's the type of service they offer",

I asked to change my dish, and the owner arrives with an attitude to tell me that she has no other choice for me but to pay what I ordered. the good thing is that several customers saw how She treated me, and they think the same . At the end she said \"thank you\" thanks why? For the twenty dollars you charged me for a plate of vegetables? Anyways, YOU NEED THEM MORE THAN I DO.",

    "text": "No one answers the phone here when you call to make reservations. .I had a Groupon for 6 ppl..the day b4 the dinner I called back to Osaka to confirm, since no one returned my call. Talk to Raquel..confirmed for 6 ppl @7pm on 4/14/16. Had an ex-co worker <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftell.me&s=3e77b0237c6a01bed6b2d1785fa02c30689b95dc651de1c34661f337a3b4f126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tell.me</a> they were celebrating things too,if I'd like to come,if already had reservations. We 3 way Osaka to ask about the Groupon deal and if we could sit together and split the checks. The man on the phone gave the phone to another woman..this,woman, was rude as hell..i asked some questions and about my reservations,if which she told me,i had no reservations . I try to reschedule with her while another party was on the phone listening. Told her,I called the day b4 and spoke with a receptionist named Racheal/Raquel,she just kept talking over me then hung up the phone without answering questions. The person holding says well,let's go anyway, too late to change now.. There's no seating until ALL YOUR PARTY IS THERE,no exceptions. Once we were all there,it was 30 minutes b4 we were seated, 15 minutes b4 our drink orders were taken,then only half the table got drinks,while another server was bringing alcoholic drinks on the table by the kids in which we didn't order. Another 15 minutes for the others to receive there drinks. We kept asking the server to start bringing the soup and salad to the table,while we discuss what other things to order..we had kids that had to go to bed for school tomorrow . While at the table there were bugs crawling around and ppl at the table killed the bugs. After a couple of minutes trying to get someone's attention, FINALLY..a woman comes and I discuss the situation with her..we show her the bugs and she gets an attitude when we ask her for new dishes...she pops off at the mouth about how we can leave and she's from Thailand and it's bugs there. What she didn't know was our table was full of Chefs,military and cooks...THAT WAS NO EXCUSE ( WE CALLED THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT FRIDAY...now we see why no one comes to this location yet go to the 1 on Sahara)..we discussed leaving yet knew we would have to wait again for another place when ppl from out of town,Henderson and straight from work was on our group..we tried to make this worst situation better. The best part of the experience was \"KK\"...He tried to do what he could with the little power he had. They kept bringing us orders we didn't order..and when the check came ..it was 8 checks and no one could explain why we had 8 checks.  I'll Never come here..this place needs to be closed,until they get there shit together. Having a Groupon that you can't explain for 8 checks,causing confusion and all you can do is blame it on the computer and not fix it. Made it seem like our party was ignorant when all we wanted was answers. Having bugs in your establishment  and having an attitude when patrons point it out towards you..YOU KNOW DAMN WELL THATS A SNHD policy. ..tried to give half a star..yet \"KK\" deserves 6 stars,since he's the only Teppan cook there. Hope this place get its restaurant together,it may closing soon",

Asked four times if I wanted rice. Said no all four times. Still given rice.   Bathroom was a wreck. Needs repairs but also needs the vulgarity etched into the mens stall i. E.  Ethnic slurs removed, Pronto. Keep it classy, Osaka.   Woman at the door obviously could not be bothered. Hated her job. Could not smile.   They charged our group of five for the entire table at hibachi. Didn't track of two different families, just slapped the whole bill at us so gratuity would be forced on us.   Water and tea needed to be refilled often, just sat there for five to ten minutes.   The hibachi chef's oil squirt bottle was a naked kid looking like he was urinating all over the table.   Never. Ever. Returning.",

I would most definitely recommend the shrimp or sea scallops if you enjoy seafood, they were amazing. The chicken and steak were just ok, kind of bland and slightly overcooked. There were also some scrambled eggs made for the kids with soy sauce and garlic butter that all of the adults tried, that were absolutely delicious. Our cook, sonny, was hilarious and a great entertainer, especially for the kids. Our waitress was also very sweet and accommodating. I definitely wouldn't not come and pay full price for this meal as only some of the food was amazing, a good portion of it was lacklustre and you don't get a whole lot, so not worth 30-50 before tax and tips. But overall it was a pretty fun place, nice atmosphere and good service. Hopefully they keep their Groupon up, I may be back if so.",

    "text": "I got a groupon for this restaurant. I took my family here for hibachi. I told my server right away that I have a groupon. Our server (Jess) wasn't pleasant explaining to us how our groupon works. So our groupon is good for 2 $32 entree, a fried rice & 2 drinks. Most of their entree are $34 or more. And if u choose an entree that's more than $32, u will need to pay up charge of $17. Paying extra $17 is just paying the whole price. I didn't really save money. The whole groupon is a scam. It's just to make people go in to their restaurant. I didn't read the reviews about the restaurant till it's too late to cancel my groupon. I figured, I guess I got no choice but to check it out. When Jess gave us our check, she added 18 % auto grat. We asked her why since it's only 4 of us. The menu said, auto grat for 6 or more people. She said that it's because of the groupon. So I read back again the groupon & didn't say anything about auto grat. It did say, tip generously!!!   I tipped the cook (George) since he was great. He is very friendly and great at his job. Food is so so. Sauce could have been better.   So I tipped 30% coz of the additional 18% auto grat that Jess did. We would have taken care of her like we took care of the cook anyways. Lying to our face about the auto grat is just unacceptable. The restaurants misleading groupon & the server is terrible.   I usually don't leave a bad review but our experience needs to be heard. Hoep u guys don't make the same mistake",

The Teriyaki  Salmon is always good here.  So no negatives on the food.  We got 1 star service here tonight.  We waited several minutes before the server came to take our drink order.  We waited so long in fact that we were ready to order all of our food.  Then after she took our drink order, we sat there very thirsty for almost another 10 minutes!  I went to the restroom while we waited for the drinks and none of the stalls had handles and the lock was completely broken on one of them.  This restaurant is very dated and it shows.  Go to the Home Depot or something!  When the food finally came, it came all at once.  We asked to start with the sushi roll.  We took two bites of the sushi roll when the rest of the meal came out, salad and main course all at the same time.  Great food, but terrible service.",

We had an 830 reservation on a Tuesday night, so we had to wait for another party to show to fill our table (understandable) - I should add that everyone at the table had Groupons - and once the Chef on duty was ready we started to get the appetizers included with our meals as we waited for Chef to get started. Portions were perfect, the scallops and tiger shrimp are super delicious, and the vegetable medley + fried rice sides were delicious. Our server Erin was great. He was doing double duty as he was the only one working at the time so he gets a 20/10 for that in my book.   The low reviews here are blown out of proportion in my mind, this place is great and they treated us coupon carriers like full paying clientele. Will be back!",

I mean I'm all for the creativity but it was messy to me. Anyways, I'm a big foodie so I'd have to give Osaka a 2star maybe 3 as far as the sushi. Ordered the \"Lissa Lisa\" roll not sure if this is just their way of making it, but compared to other sushi restaurants this looked nothing like a Lisa Lisa Roll nor did it taste like it. The vegetable Tempura had little to no Tempura batter on them. I think the Philly Tempura was the best thing I ate.  I really hope they improve on the sushi because I don't think I'll be back again :(",

    "text": "We had eaten at Osaka Summerlin before and enjoyed it, so I was really disappointed in this experience.   We were taking our three daughters and our oldest daughter's friend out for dinner. Since six people is a pricey dinner, I knew that I'd be Grouponing it. I purchased dinner for six, but my daughter's friend had a headache, so she didn't come with us. No big deal, we figured that we could package up her meal.  Upon arrival, the restaurant seemed to have taken a downturn since our last visit. One of the outer doors was out of order and the other was very difficult to open and made a loud noise when it closed. The lobby area, in which we were forced to wait for 45 minutes past our reservation time, was unwelcoming and had inadequate seating. The party waiting before we arrived left, telling us that they had waited for nearly an hour.   When I asked our waitress to prepare one of the six meals to go, she told me that there would be a ten dollar fee for this service. Thinking this ridiculous, I asked to talk to the manager. She told me in a very rude tone that they would not package up any meals to go, as that Groupon was for dine-in only. Pointing out to her that five of the six of us were dining in made no difference. She complained that some people have been \"taking advantage\" of the Groupons and that \"Groupon takes half the money.\" I reminded her that it was the choice of the restaurant to do business with Groupon, to which she said that she used it to get people in there to order alcohol and other add-on items.   The service was ridiculously slow, and there were food particles on the grill when the chef began to prepare our food. The family sharing the table with us said that their wait was similar to ours, though the restaurant was less than half full. Two of our entrees were entirely forgotten, which meant we needed to remind them and wait additional time as it was prepped. Our reservation was at 7:00, but it was after 9:00 before our entire group had been served. We were not checked on periodically, making it necessary to flag down staff for refills and other items.   I shall not return.",

    "text": "Sadly this restaurant has gone downhill in many ways.  Upon entering we sat at the bar to order a drink while waiting for the remainder of our party.   It took 10 minutes to order.  We ordered with one bartender and the other one that walked away returned and said they are my customers.   She upsold my wine on her own and had to ask the other bartender how to make my husbands drink.   While sitting I noticed many light fixtures with bulbs out. The fixtures themselves are part of the decor and beautiful so why not make sure the bulbs are replaced? We were using a groupon and when we were ordering kept being told that is $10 more, that is x more. We got the point, just let us order please.  The menu itself was raggedy and worn.   The soup was broth with 2 pieces of tofu.  The salad...well not sure you can call it that as it was 3 forkfuls of lettuce with shredded carrots on top served on a saucer.   The portions of meat were small and the chef cut up everything small so that it appeared you got more.  I ended up having to use a fork vs. chopsticks.   You no longer receive shrimp with every entree.   Overall it was extremely disappointing and we won't be returning.",

Whatever. Asked for beer again. Still no sushi. The chef came to the table and began cooking. As soon as the \"fried\" rice hit my plate I told my girlfriend we should leave. It was mostly steamed and had very little soy sauce, egg, or veggies. Tried it anyway - awful. The couple next to us expressed an allergy to mushrooms and shell fish. Guess what they got - shell fish and mushrooms. Veggies were awful. We both ordered ribeye. The chef didn't ask how we'd like it cooked. My girlfriend asked for her steak cooked medium and for mine to be cooked medium rare. The chef cooked both our steaks well done. Our sushi showed up lukewarm and an hour late. We asked for a manager. No manager tonight.   The worst part is no one cared how bad it was. Our server asked if we wanted a box. My girlfriend said no, it was terrible. The server just walked away. The chef didn't care that we sat in front of a plate of uneaten for. Who does that?  Bottom line, we paid $80 for a meal we didn't eat. This place is too expensive, even with a Groupon, to be this bad. Not sure what changed, but while in the past I might i recommended it, now I say stay away. There are other choices, and I recommend you try them.",

Food portions were so small compared to what was charged. Beef was very tough, it was bland and lacked any flavor at all. I did like the ribs, tho, it was tender and well marinated. The decor seemed a little too much for me. Too many flashing pieces all around the place screaming for attention. Almost all the paintings displayed have a small placard describing the artist, and price tag for sale. So Osaka is part restaurant, part art gallery? Most staff seemed like they didn't have much to do, as it looked like they didn't have many customers to serve on a weekend during dinner hours. They just walked around trying to look busy. I'm still pondering whether I should return to do an update. I really wanted to like this place as it's so close to my place",

    "text": "Hibachewww! I have to say this is probably the worst hibachi place we have ever been to, and we have been to quite a few.   We came for my husbands birthday and decided to skip our normal place because this place offered a groupon. Take my advice and pay the extra money and eat elsewhere.  We got our drink orders about 20 minutes after they were taken. Our hibachi started about an hour after the reservation. I don't know who it was doing our hibachi dinner because he never Introduced himself and was very quiet.   During the cooking of our meal, a fellow table spilled their drink, and he tended to them, left our scallops and shrimp to over cook on the grill.   They were like eating rubber.  The meat is flavorless. And the portions are insulting. The only good thing about this place is the beautiful decor and the fried rice.  They don't allow you to substitute any of the veggies, soup, or salad for anything. So if you are getting the Osaka medley and don't like any of those things, prepare for a few pieces of chicken and steak on your plate.   They did sing my husband a very nice happy birthday and their signs are a very nice touch. The people singing however seem absolutely miserable .   You couldn't pay me enough to eat here again.",

We had a hibachi dinner for two, they tell us what we can and can't order unless we want to pay $10 more, ok fine.  I read my groupon I knew what was allowed to be ordered.  We asked about what's on Happy Hour, if you come in during a happy hour with a groupon you aren't allowed to order happy hour items (weird)...  the first server overshared and said that last time he allowed people to order happy hour with a groupon he had to pay $40 out of pocket, ok then.  No need to tell us that. We got a soda and a beer (included in groupon) but once a glass was empty our server was no where to be found most likely because were alone in the back corner on the restaurant as some others have called the \"groupon table\".   We ordered the screaming onion roll I enjoyed, it is covered in sauce FYI, which I like but that's all it tasted like.  We also ordered the eclectic poke which was very over priced for some fish on a bed of avocado and onion and lettuce. I got the ribeye hibachi with fried rice, you get a very tiny thin ribeye and that's all the meat I get.  My boyfriend got the ny with chicken, which is a much better portion so he had shared half his chicken with me.  Two pieces of shrimp come with each order which was a nice surprise.  Hibachi chef was friendly and great, but our food was very underseasoned, not a whole lot of flavor at all.   Overall, we would never return because our server rarely came by when we had empty glasses and she wasn't all that nice to us.  Just wasn't what we expected for $90 total with groupon & appetizers.",

We were done eating our soup, salad and the chef was already out and we still didn't get our drinks. The chef was entertaining but the food was just ok. right after the chef left the table the server came and ask if we needed boxes as if she wants us out ASAP.

The sushi chef was not amiable whatsoever.  The japanese lasagna here is nothing compared to the stuff they make at the location on Eastern.  I worked in the Summerhill Plaza at one point in time and if they were decent, I would've spent so much money here on lunch/dinner. That's too bad. I hardly ever have sushi this depressing.

    "text": "This is the place to go if you like a fairly nice place with mediocre food that is highly priced. The first time we went there, we were on a business dinner with people who, as we found out later, were partially owners. We were treated like kings. Everything perfect.   The second time, we were by ourselves. The service was noticeably less attractive and the food was not the same as the first time. We thought: \"Ok, maybe this is an off day.\"   The third experience was absolutely horrible. The service was slow, the food quality and presentation was, to say it politely, yucky! The desert was that thing with ice cream in the middle and supposedly \"freshly\" made crisp layer outside. Holly crap! that supposedly freshly made crisp aroud the ice cream was so leathery I could make a genuine Chanel bag out of it. I called the waitress over and asked to get a fresh one. She said that was fresh. I offered her to have a bit and after tasting if she told me it was fresh, I would accept it. She declined. I asked her to send it back and take it off our order as that dessert was unacceptable. She did take it back. She did not bring us a freshly made one but she did charge us $17 for it. I noticed that on the bill and asked her to take it off. She said she wouldn't. I was so tempted to give her $0 tips, but I know better. It is not up to the waitress, especially in Vegas. It is the owners and the management of the place. So, i did give her an acceptable tip and decided that was it. No more Osaka for us. There are plenty of awesome places in Vegas to have Sushi. No reason to waste our money on this place.",

    "text": "No star! ... First impression always sticks! This place smelled like sewer from parking lot. My wife & I and our 15 month old went to this place knowing it's a totally different menu from the one on Sahara. Lady (looks japanese, maybe the owner or whatever) greeted us and ask if we are bar dining or regular dining. We said regular for 2.5 cuzz of our baby. The place looks like a ghost town with couple on the sushi bar. On the other side is a total mess, only couple of tables almost done eating and the rest of the tables were dirty! Now, I'm a server at Aria and if I walked into a place disarray with one server (young asian dude) running around crazy and it wasn't even busy, there is definitely something wrong. But I have it the benefit of the doubt that lunch rush just probably hit this place. Ok, so the lady decided to sit us in a booth with little room for the high chair at the end of our booth (it's better to sit a family with a baby on a table, if space is limited between tables). The tables in this restaurant are close to each other. Mind you she could've cleaned up a table next to the wall or something so our high chair is not obstructing the pathway!! Ok ... Moving on, the table is covered with a dark color cloth and on top is placed a white paper like its an up scale restaurant. We had to move the paper a little far from the reach of our baby because he grabs everything in front of him and a paper cut will just not be good. Ok .. Underneath this (epic-fail-to-look-upscale) paper is a dirty-ass table with crumbs and stains that looked like she just place a new paper so she could sit us (her name might be Joy, she look like a joy). A dirty place is not how to impress your patrons! I get it, this place is located at Summerlin (woop tidoo), business men and the likes come here and hang out so the place is trying to cater to that. So we were greeted and asked for the drink and water was delivered. The menu did not wow us! My wife loves a certain roll on the Sahara location (which we go to all the freaking time, but they were filming something there so it was closed to the public today, and the brother is the owner) and also I love my treasure island roll (they did not have it). So we decided to just leave and go to SOHO at Jones & Warm Springs (pretty nice sushi joint but we still love Osaka on Sahara). All in all for you peeps that wanna try this place out .. Please consider this a restaurant (OSAKA ON SAHARA) that serves quality food, great service and clean baby friendly environment WILL NEVER EVER HAVE GROUPON or some type of promotion, you know why because they are that damn good and people know it!!! And people pay!!! This joint however does Groupon crap and guess what that 3 star on their review is for a reason compare to the the Sahara location with 4 star .. One star is a big difference! So drive yourself that extra 15 minutes and go to Sahara because it's all worth your time, money and you know that it's a clean environment! Dirty environment equals food poisoning. Disarray restaurant equals promotion to get people to come. My review on this equals poor management/ownership (the sister owns this Summerlin location) Peace!",

I have been to some of the other Westside sushi joints and will occasionally get some bad fish.  The chefs here studied under some of Las Vegas' most experienced sushi chefs which means that they do not just know how to roll up some rice and fish, but they actually know how to handle and prepare the fish for assembling into ornamental edible delights.    If yo haven't been to Osaka in a while, you really should go because the decor is now as appealing as the food.  And they have free WIFI.",

Supposed to have dinner at 8pm, party of 12.......after waiting 45 minutes AND some of the party paying for drinks at the bar, we are told there is no room for our party.....somehow the reservation was missing?????  My personal thought....they also had a party of 40...hmmmm which would make them more money?  Turned out for the best for our party....we went to GEISHA HOUSE on N. Decatur and had a WONDERFUL diner, EXCELLENT service, YUMMY food...so I guess Thank you Osaka for losing the reservation....we went somewhere else where our business was appreciated and had a great time!  Oh and won't be back to Osaka!",

    "text": "The first thing I noticed when walking into Oska was the layout. When you first enter you see a small but sleek bar. Then to the left of the bar is a full sushi bar allowing you the pleasure of watching your favorite rolls being created. Off to the right of the sushi bar is the dining area framed with numerous grilling tables.  Our server was attentive and help us with any questions we had. My father and I each had a Sapporo and my mom had their Pomegranate martini. Her martini was garnished with fresh Pom seeds and she told us it was one of the better Pomtini's she's had.  After we ordered drinks we moved on to the appetizers. We decided we'd get the Calamari and Spicy Edamame. The Calamari arrived fried to perfection. It was light, crisp and very fresh. A dark dipping sauce accompanied it but was a tad bitter with a strange after taste. Next came the Spicy Edamame and let me tell you; these were awesome. I would describe the taste as a somewhat meaty, garlic, red pepper fusion. Either way take my word for it and order yourself some.  Finally we get to the highlight of the evening; Sushi. We ordered four rolls and split them between ourselves. The Hamachi (yellowtail and chive), 911 (crab,avocado, spicy tempura), California Crunch (Cali roll tempura), and The Taylor (Shrimp,Crab. topped with fresh salmon). Talk a great sushi. The Hamachi definitely had a fishy taste, but was incredibly fresh. I find that yellow tail always has that fish taste. And while you can never go wrong with Cali Crunch (its a classic) this one while incredibly tasty needed just a little more tempura to make it really crunch. The 911 was the best I have ever had! It was the perfect heat, crunch and just pure yumminess. And finally The Taylor  with its tempura shrimp and delectable crab topped with a perfect cut of salmon was my personal favorite of the night. The combination was just right with the salmon giving it a sweet almost candy like chew. -AMAZING- And I don't say that lightly. I am a very picky eater and the fact that this roll was my favorite is saying something.  Over all we loved our meal and have deemed it one of our new hot spots. And their Happy Hour lasts from 3-7 which meant our whole meal was on a slight special. Not only that but they have a killer lunch special that has many menu items at 50% off.",

In the past soup just kinda made it to the table when ever!  I know I will be back again and I am glad that Osaka has learned from patron feedback and is growing in service!!! If you love the food but the service was bad go back! New great service!",

I am not a huge sushi critic, the simplest sushi can please me! But I will say, the quality of their sushi is just not that good. The first time I went, I was satisfied but every other time I went, it has just gotten worse and worse. Their happy hour prices are a bit expensive for the serving size they give. I was speaking with one of the waiters and she informed me that if they honor a coupon or any kind of discount, the owner takes the difference out of their checks or they have to pay out of pocket up front. I was disappointed to hear that. Obviously the owner is only worried about money instead of the satisfaction of their regular customers. I wouldn't recommend the sushi options to anybody. I must say, their hibachi happy hour is a good deal though!",

    "text": "This used to be a really nice place to have a nice lunch or dinner. In fact, it was of of our favorite places to eat. Unfortunately the service, the food and the atmosphere has gone downhill in the last couple of years. The first time my husband and I experienced this place was a company Christmas party a few years ago. The service and the food was wonderful. Osaka's was the place to go for my husband and I whenever we were in the mood for sushi. We noticed that whenever the manager/owner was not around, the restaurant ran smoothly, everyone was happy and at ease, which made for a pleasant experience. However, when she is around, expect that she, along with the wait staff are running around like chickens with no heads acting busy for no reason. The manager is extremely unprofessional and annoying and has no problem raising her voice to her wait staff in front of customers which I find very offensive.  Our most recent visit the other night had me make up my mind to never waste my money on this place ever again. We walk in for dinner and the hostess asks us \"how many in your party?\" I reply \"2 for the sushi bar please\" immediately points me over to the couch and says \"it will be about 15 minutes\" mind you the sushi bar is half empty. So we sit on the couch... at about he 10 minute mark, the owner tells one of the waitresses, \"two for sushi bar\" watiress looks over at us, turns away and preps the settings for the sushi bar. What do you think happens next? If you guessed that we got seated, you're wrong...  she completely forgot about us! So 15 minutes later, we got up and walked out. Complete crap. It was actually a blessing in disguise because we ended up down the street at \"The Sushi\" on Lake Mead. The best sushi experience we ever had. Wonderful customer service, fun, happy atmosphere, sushi to die for and guess what? It was all you can eat....not just sushi, but everything on the menu for $20.95 per person. Good bye Osaka, I will never be back and I will never recommend you.",

The few minutes turned into a half hour wait, which we understood because we didn't make a reservation.  After we sat down at our hibachi table is when things got really weird. First off, the room was insanely hot. Neither a waitress or waiter offered to do anything about it. secondly, the waitress told me i was not allowed to order a california roll in addition to my hibachi meal which I found a really strange policy, but whatever. We began to get irritated when it took an hour for our chef to come to our table. During this time, the two adult couples sitting with us were comped wine, but my underaged friends and I received nothing.  An hour and a half after our arrival, we finally got some food on our plates. It was good, but the portions were really small. Also, none of their hibachi meals come with any form of rice. I thought this was strange considering how pricey each of the meals were. The whole time we ate my friends glass of water was empty, and she ended up having to flag down our waitress from across he room to get a refill. Our bill came out to $80, and since the adults at our table were comped alcohol we felt it would be reasonable for them to give us some sort of discount or take off one of the smaller dishes we ordered, but we were told that they couldn't do that. They offered us ice cream instead, but it was a little late at this point now that we were finally full. Maybe they could have brought it while we sat waiting at our table for an hour.  Overall, the service was just rude and unhelpful, the food is overpriced and the portions are too small. Definitely not a pleasant experience.",

The interior was really nice -cold though, which is nice for Vegas, but bring a jacket!  We sat in one of the booths -high backs and comfy; very intimate.  They also have large community tables with the Habachi grills.  The sushi bar was also gorgeous -the whole place is so dark and sexy!  Everything was delicious, this is what we ordered:  911 roll: fire roll (spicy Miki roll) topped w/ crunch (our favorite out of everything we ordered)  Japanese Lasagna roll:  crab, avocado, cream cheese, baked w/yum yum sauce  007 roll: Shrimp, Scallop, Miki, Tobiko, Cream Cheese Topped w/ Avo, Albacore. Served with Garlic & Yumyum Sauce  Albacore white tuna nigiri  Miso soup  Dynamite: Baked Scallops, Clam, Crab in Shin's Special Sauce  Watermelon martini -fresh chuck of watermelon; very summer-y taste!  Prices are fair, and the service is great!  Next time we might go for the Teppan Grill meal, since they cook it in front of you!",

    "text": "Food was ok. Service was the worst I have ever seen. The chef flung the large cooking fork at one of the people at the table, hitting him in the chest and arm. After the person handed the fork back to the chef he continued to use it to prepare food for everyone (health code violation for sure). If that wasn't enough, he accidentally put a shrimp on the wrong plate and asked that person to move the shrimp onto the intended persons plate (seriously).  He sprayed four people at the table with hot oil. When he did the egg-cracking trick, he splattered egg on the same guest at our table that he flung the fork at earlier. I have never seen anything like this before, and I have been to a lot of hibachi restaurants. In addition, the service was slow. After speaking to the manager about the experience (having been sprayed on the arm by hot oil) we expected the manager to give a discount or comp a portion of the meal (you know the reasonable thing to do) instead we were told that we were looking for a free hand out. I have never been so offended. He never apologized for the experience. When we told him we did not want to pay full price for the horrible experience, he threatened to call the cops. His accusation is nonsense and his professionalism is non-existent. I will never eat here again and I highly discourage others from visiting this establishment.",

I am glad we had that voucher because I would hate to have paid another penny on this place --- staff is friendly though so I hate to write this.  We were instantly greeted and seated - given the option to pick where we were comfortable. First of all, don't understand the decor at all to the point where I found myself looking at the details and getting a little annoyed. White snake print seats with green backing - Indian looking lanterns - in a Japanese setting? Anyway, my fiance ordered a bento with beef teriyaki and it came out dry. I ordered ramen which took unbelievably long. The greeter and waitress came out twice to apologize that it's taking long. My fiance was done with his bento by the time my food arrived. I love creme brulee and they had a trio that included three flavors - green tea, sesame, and the original vanilla. Keep in mind beforehand I asked if I could get just vanilla for all three and they said no. I was thinking it was physically impossible. When it came out it was 3 shot glasses with each flavor - so much for pleasing your guest - why couldn't they just put 3 vanilla shot glasses? The flavored brulees were horrible - for $10 I don't recommend this dessert.   Actually -- I don't recommend this place at all unless you have lots of time to stare at ugly decor. Try sushi ko on 95&craig!",

Whoaa!!! me and my wife had most phenomenal Japanese dinner after longest time. Their Teriaki chicken is so tender and not much sweetness on that. which make more of the food taste, not the real sweet taste. Also, in side the restaurant so much nice energistic colors and i heard from the server they just remodel the whole thing and they have new chef working great after they get rid of the old staff. we Really enjoyed the time and the food with Osaka, ANd we surely  go back for the lunch time to try their new \"Lunch Special\"...",

I walked in here after looking at the paper menu and the prices on that menu, attracted me to the place the happy hour items and prices were very good. It was happy hour, when I walked in and sat down they gave me a plastic menu and I saw that most of the rolls that were on the paper menu were gone and everything else was either 2$ more or 3$ more then what it said on the paper menu.  I showed them the paper menu to compare it to the plastic and they said \"yeah we haven't had time to change it\". Um then why don't you just not give out the paper menus anymore until you change it?  I was attracted to the place after looking at the menu but then you guys switch me to a different menu? Not cool!  I complained to them and they honored the paper menu price rather then me paying the 3$ more but wouldn't make me the roll I wanted that was on the other menu.   Will not be coming back.",

Reservations for 7 pm were worthless as we watched a standing room only bar area with at least 15 to 20 people standingget seated, we 4 minorities the only ones not seated.  AlI witnessed at least 6 to 8 customers arrived 20 minutes after we arrived  get seated while we waited...did I mention we had reservations. A request for a manager resulted in us being informed that there wasn't a manager on a SATURDAY NIGHT. I can't critique the food because we never got seated. When it was obvious that we were leaving only THEN did we get an obviously obnoxious question asking if we were ready to be seated, we declined. If this is how customers get treated at Osaka, then 2 and a half stars are 2 stars too many. The app won't let me select NO STARS, so one will have to suffice.",

The waitress was getting the orders screwed up but had the nerve to be a bit surly.   Due to waiting an HOUR for the meal cooking to even start, the 4 year old had drank all of her apple juice.  So when the meal was finally plated and we asked for a re-fill, the waitress wanted to nit pick.  No refill.  For a 4 year old?  After an hour wait ?   Glad we're from out of town, just and only here to visit a relative.   Do NOT waste time on this lousy service place !!!",

I came here with some friends because we found a groupon and I probably wouldn't come back even with a discount.   The sushi was not great, barely okay. I'm not a sushi expert, and to be honest I still have a hard time with some of the simpler raw stuff where the fish is the focus, but I know a good California roll and these weren't it. The spicy tuna rolls were also lackluster in both flavor and spicy. The worst part about the California rolls was how much veggie they stuffed in there. Come on guys, it's obvious you're using imitation crab meat, now you want to pinch pennies by giving me a half roll worth and filling the empty space with even cheaper veggie?  The drinks were expensive.  The steaks, chicken, shrimp, and scallops I had during the main course were all very well seasoned and expertly cooked, but that can't overcome a bad cut of meat or a flavorless shrimp. I had to make liberal use of the two sauces they provide and that's a shame. Good meats and seafood, when well made, should be able to stand completely on their own.   The fried rice was awesome. Probably because it's basically impossible to mess up the ingredients. Speaking of rice, the rice in the sushi was also excellent. So I guess there's that.",

The restaurant is very nicely decorated, which created a great ambiance. They played good, hip music. Our server, Robin, was also very friendly, professional and attentive. He came by to check on us frequently (but not too much that it got annoying), refilled our sake cups, water glasses and soda for us, without us having to ask. That's wonderful customer service!   I ordered the surf and turf with filet mignon and lobster. Hubby ordered the seafood combo with tiger shrimp, scallops, and lobster. We both ordered fried rice for an additional $3.50 because hibachi entrees regularly come with white steamed rice. We enjoyed our whole dining experience, but I'm taking one star off because although the food was good and flavorful, it was a little greasy. The lobster was also a little dry and over cooked. We'd definitely come back again.",

Off the happy hour menu that's your fault for giving me large portions I only want the cheapo menu. I don't know your sizes I trust you to give me what is on the happy hour menu. When the waitress comes back with the new adjusted bill I look at it I politely tell her she did not adjust the price to the happy hour. Send the poor little waitress have to go get the owner Joy, joy the owner comes out and yells at me saying I ordered a $15 sushi roll why you selling It for $8 .

    "text": "Horrible service, decent food.  My family went to dinner here on a Tuesday night around 730pm. Me, my spouse, my toddler, and my infant. We had a gift card for $50, and decided to use $40-ish and apply the rest as tip. You have the choice of sitting at the sushi bar, the teppanyaki grill/tables, or a regular table. We opted for the regular table since we had the kids.   They do have high chairs, which is nice! The grill-folk do high-fire tricks and a lot of spatula clanging, so if you have a skiddish toddler... probably not the right place to go unless you enjoy eating with a two year old sitting on your head. The seating in the regular table area was a bit awkward. Giant chairs on wheels that you sink into. The waitress chooses that moment as I am weirdly scooting back in while trying not to sink through to the floor to come up and greet us.  She was nice enough, bubbly and friendly. That, however, is the only positive comment to be had about the service. Snail paced is the best phrase to use in regards to food preparation and delivery.  -15 minutes till we got to order and got our drinks. -15 minutes for the appetizer (chicken katsu, which was pretty good. crunchy and well seasoned).  -30 minutes for dinner (2 chicken teriyaki bento boxes. chicken was good. came with a huge portion of tempura shrimp and veggies. very reasonable for $15 or so).  -30 minutes for the check (I asked if I could use the remaining $9 and change as tip and was told that I could not and would have to take the remainder as a new gift card). -15 minutes for a piece of banana cheese cake in a box (ordered this because I didn't want a $9 giftcard sitting around. when they finally brought it to me, it was a mushy pile that had been thrown in a box. picture added here to show the cafeteria style glop that was $8). 20 minutes for change (because I could not leave the tip, I had to break a $100 bill. I asked for a $10, a $5, and five $1 somewhere in the mix of that change. I received a $50, a $10, and some $20. So I had to wait an additional 5 minutes while I flagged someone down to get the appropriate change. All this for a tip that in the end I probably should have not even bothered to give! Maybe I should have left my banana glop as a tip).   Over 2 hours for 3 and 1/2 star food and a box of banana cheesecake baby food mash is a bit much for me and my family. Thank goodness we didn't order anything complicated, we would probably still be sitting there waiting!!!   I have tried to call 3 times on different days at different times to talk to a manager about the appalling service, have left my name and number each time. Have not spoken to her yet. I was told \"if she doesn't call you, just keep trying\". I find that exceptionally odd. I am trying to let you know about crappy service, and you are not calling me back. Gee, I wonder where your staff get their laid back barely working attitude from. I was trying to wait until I had spoken with her to make this post, but that patience has passed.",

    "text": "So disappointed... Ordered lunch for pick-up on 6/25/14 for a going-away luncheon ( 6 people) after 2 co-workers raved about the food. Two of the sushi rolls ordered were for 2 different people but put in same container so closely together that it became a mess when separated to go to each person.  One was the Philadelphia roll which this person had ordered several times in the past. She noticed that it did not taste \"the same\".  She did not say it was bad- just \"different\" and she did not finish it (and it was her going-away lunch)  We also ordered 2 appetizer sized vegetable tempura ( it usually is a decent sized portion) but got 2 tiny sides of the tempura (and only  charged $5.95) but for one of the persons, that was supposed to be their \"meal\" ( and disappointingly , they were almost flavorless).  Only 1 little plastic cup of sauce ( unsure what kind or what it was supposed to go with) came with ALL of the food & 3 packets of soy sauce.  The persons who ordered the chicken teriyaki lunches said their food was fine.  Tje person who ordered shrimp fried rice said it was \"fine\" ( not the highest compliment) . The biggest let-down was not receiving the Rock Shrimp Salad ( but charged). Ok, this happens.  I call the restaurant to explain.  The employee apologized & said it was ready and did we want to come back to pick up?  Uh- no, I could not drive back to pick it up. The employee did apologize and said he would speak to his manager to correct the charge. 15 minutes later, she did call- very apologetic and said she would remove the charge. She asked for my card information in order to make the correction - including my security code # and assured it would be handled.   Saturday I awaken to a debut withdrawal for the original amount.  I waited until 1130 am that morning to call but no one answered.  Had to leave for a day full of errands and figured that who knows what could happen in trying to collect my 9.95 back.  So I will just chalk this up to a very poor experience all the way around and patronize other restaurants close to our office instead.",

Along with that I got an order nigiri salmon roe, not sure if they soak their roe in marinade 1st but personally I don't think so because I enjoyed it, usually when salmon roe has been marinated it's been over done and I could really taste the actual roe not a bunch of other flavors that I wasn't looking forward to....anyhow now the kicker and I mean kicker...because wait til you hear how excited I was leaving lol... So...I told the Sushi Chef that I really wanted to try something different and unique to Osaka, he then suggested the S.O.S roll(don't panic it's on menu)all I can say is OMG! HOW DID THEY KNOW I WAS COMING! It's devilishly delicious with a sauteed medium-sized shrimp for every bite, it's spicy, citrusy, savory... it's a freak'n flavor bomb, I loved it! Anyways, the Chef sat down a few seats besides me while I finished eating and I told him that I couldn't find anything wrong with it and I usually find something wrong especially if there's mayo on my SD sushi, but I was speachless! When I got up to leave I was so excited as I was walking out I ran right into the glass doors, I kicked the doors with my knee, LMBO...My knee still hurts lol! I don't even care!!! Go to Osaka and give them a shot, so far I'm very impressed and I can't wait to go back, Oh, and if you complain about the prices get over it because you must be one of those people who are use to eating at  $20 #AllUCANEATS and if that's the case it's definitely time for a change!",

This place enjoys serving rice rolls which are bland,  boring and might I ask,  \"where's the fish\". They serve California rolls with different sauces and they market them with different names.  By the way this place has no affiliation with the Osaka on Sahara.  But the owners are family,  but obviously one sibling cares about the quality of sushi his restaurant serves while the other is more interested in selling booze and the club scene.",

    "text": "Wow! I should have listened to the other Yelper's and went to a different Osakas.  I purchased a Yelp Osaka deal that stated that I get $15 worth of food for $25. So my family and I went to Osakas on Mother's Day. On the door there was a list of coupons that they did not take , Yelp was not on the list. I figured it wasn't because I thought Yelp had a special contract with the businesses they do deals with. No where on their coupon does it say \" Will not be honored on holidays\". So, we asked our waitress and she said \"no, they do not accept any coupons on holidays\".  We figured that since we were there , we might as well eat. So I ordered a combo box of beef and chicken and TNA rolls. When we received our meal , I noticed it was only chicken. I told the waitress that I ordered the box, she insisted that I didn't. I asked her if she can just make it the combo by bringing me the tempura that goes along with it, she said that she couldn't. So my husband and I continued to eat our small overpriced meal.  Later, the waitress returned and told us how AMAZING their watermelon martini was, so I decided to ordered it. It was lackluster and flavorless. The watermelon that they used must have been unripe. She asked me how it was and I told her it was disgusting. She replied \"Oh, our normal bartender didn't make this one, he just walked in. Everyone makes them different.\" She then paused. I expected her to offer me another drink, instead she just continued to look at me with a blank look on her face.  Finally, after eating my meal, and drinking my terrible drink, we received our sushi. I ordered the sushi as an appetizer, but I received it after I was completely done with my meal. She kept on telling me that it would be coming out shortly. By the time that we received it, I didn't even want it. The TNA sushi was alright. The tuna kind of lacked flavor.  Lastly, she came with the check. I was hoping that we would have received something comped, at least the drink because she had herself admitted that there was a reason that it wasn't as good. We were greeted by a bill with EVERYTHING on it. The waitress brought the credit card machine to the desk. Then, they ask you to punch the tip in the machine as they are staring at you. AK WARD.  This experience was terrible. I would never recommend it to a free.   P.S. I already asked Yelp for a refund for my unused coupon.",

When we arrived we were ignored a while, barely acknowledged and poorly directed to sit somewhere \"over there\".  We had to ask for a drink to be noticed after we sat like fools on the faux crocodile leather half-way couch.    When we finally got seated after 15 minutes(we had a reservation and the house was far from full) we tried to figure out the menu. It  was confusing, laminated pages on a clipboard, and our waitress couldn't hear us or help us... very loud, she did not understand us and we couldn't hear her. she didn't seem to know anything.     Our drinks were lame and watery and overpriced.... our appetizers arrived separately and no shoyu!  We had to snatch it from our fellow neglected  table sharers.  The hibachi cooks were great and entertaining, KK was our dude and he was a good sport but... how bout some clean towels?  No one checked back on us; seemed disorganized.    Bathrooms were gross; just a small food bucket for a trash can overflowing with dirty paper towels, and broken latches on stall doors that wouldn't shut!  The planter outside was all broken with trash outside and the decorative accent lights were half burnt out. It's the small signs of an owner that quit caring. I was wanting to try this place for years,  it is a shame. I won't go back.",

At the time i arrived, Meghan, my server, greeted me with a bright welcoming smile. She sat me down at the sushi bar where i had some great sushi. I also had some hot Sake and Kirin beer, which was poured by my server. She was a very fun and energetic person to talk to, which made the lunch experience that much better.

We have observed before \"the Groupon effect\" here with smaller portions and light drink pours, but this night was just ridiculous.  Many others have commented on the ludicrous $17 upcharge for anything other than their basics up to $32 (in effect wiping out your Groupon savings and charging you even more than had you not purchased a Groupon).  Obviously, their goal is to \"pin you in\" to their cheaper menu items (which are not \"cheap\" at all...$32 for chicken/shrimp combo?).  What really made us swear off this place for good was that the entree portion of my meal was the smallest I have received at any restaurant.  Ever... Literally five small pieces of shrimp and about 7 small pieces of chicken (maybe 1/4 of a breast if that).  The \"appetizer\" that each person got was another 2 tiny pieces of shrimp....what a joke!  At least our chef worked hard to entertain our 2 year old boy, otherwise I would have rated this place one star.  Total rip off even with the Groupon.  We go to Hoikkado in Summerlin, where their regular prices are about the same as this place once you apply the Groupon, but the portions, service and atmosphere are far superior.  These guys have learned how to work the Groupon system to still make a lot of money, so don't go thinking you are getting a deal.  You will be shortchanged and/or upcharged for a decent experience.  In fact, don't go at all.",

The chef bragged too much of his accomplishments and was in a hurry to cook our food.   Food was flying around when he was cutting and whatever he was doing.  Then we felt that they were rushing us because we were still eating and they were already putting plates on our table.  Very rude.  Food was average and we didn't even enjoy our meal.  Stay away from this place!!!!",

Refills on drinks is impossible & to say the waitress was a rude ass bitch is an understatement! I will never NEVER step foot in this dump again...Ever! Ojanas (sp) is a hundred times better, great prices, EXCELLENT customer service & they treat everyone with respect AND a smile & the food is DELECIOUS!",

I found out that the Lake Mead location isn't owned by the same individual that runs the Eastern and Sahara restaurants.    The sushi chef did not know some basic menu items I asked for: Is the Uni fresh?  He had to ask someone and than came back saying they didn't carry it.  Do you have Kanpachi? He didn't know what that was.  He kept asking us how we wanted our orders prepared.  When I asked for a Garlic Tuna, he delivered a huge cut role!!  It appeared he had just come from a stint at Yogurt Land.  Very disappointing service and atmosphere.",

The problem is that all of the good entrees are $35 and up and in stead of just allowing you to pay the difference there is a $17 fee per person which makes it cost more than regular price! To use our Groupon we would have had to order a downgraded meal, so to get what we wanted we were stuck paying full price. We would have been return customers if it weren't for this deceptive advertising. Very dissapointing.",

The service was great very attentive and the chef was very professional and did the best he could with the sub par ingredients. The food was below grade and very expensive.  I had the Mt Fuji, Fillet, Chicken and Lobster with a two shrimp appetizer.  The fillet was very tough and not great quality, the shrimp was literally just two shrimps.  Since the dinner was almost 50.00 it wasn't really worth the price.  I have been going to Geisha Steakhouse on east DI for years and it is much better and less expensive.",

It was my husband and I and another family who had a groupon as well. Our waitress instantly looked moody when we told her we had a groupon. She took our drink order and dissappeared fro what seemed like a very long time. The table next to us sat down after us, got their drinks right away and were eating when we were barely getting our drinks. The waitress didn't come back to check us on until the check came.  It's unfortunate that customers are treated differently because of an offer that you agreed to.  Once again, the food was great, the service not so much!",

As soon as he starts cooking, he asked the waitress to get him a drink... The night proceeded to get more and more awkward by the minute. The chef and his friend began talking about how terrible osakas management is. They were also talking bad about other employees aka our waitress and the other chef.  He proceeded to talk about how bad his manager was and how \"crazy\" she is . after the bartender cut the chefs friend off, he then came back to the table cursing and blaming the waitress as listed above. The chef made no attempt to interact with any other customers which made for very bad experience.  If I were his manager and heard the way he talked about me and other staff, I wouldn't even be mad, if be embarrassed. It should go without saying, will not be returning.",

The deal with Groupon was great. We have gone before back in November without the Groupon for my dughters birthday and had the BEST experience. So when we saw the Groupon deal we were excited to take some friends with us who had never been there. The waitress however was rude from the seating. When she came to take our orders, we explained to her that 6 of us were having hibachi and 1 would be ordering alacarte because he is vegan. She told us that we needed to wait and tell the chef but was rude about it. When one of our friends ordered the seafood combo she literally raised her voice looked at my.husband from across the table and very loudly said there would be a $17 up charge (btw the price difference between the seafood combo and included meats is only $6 on the menu)  this made our friend feel terrible! We then we're served the soup and salad but had to wait 1 hour and 20 minutes before our chef Jimmy came to start the hibachi. Jimmy was worth the wait. He was friendly and great but wasn't prepared for my vegan son to order a lacarte. We had to wait more so that he could go back to the kitchen. (Previously in November we had ordered for him when we ordered for ourselves and they prepared his meal in the back while ours was on the hibachi but this time the waitress was difficult) After our delicious dinner, she brought us the check and decided to announce the total to everyone. Not only to our table but the entire restaurant. My husband tried to call her closer to be more discreet as we were paying for our friends but she didn't get the hint. He told her What about dessert? We wanted to order dessert and had not even been offered! Our friends pulled out their credit cards and told us they felt bad that we were being charged an up charge and wanted to help pay. They were embarrassed. The worst part is that this girl was also training another girl who had shadowed her all night. It wasn't just our table. We pretty much knew how much every table was paying for their meals because of how loud she was. I tried calling the restaurant this afternoon to speak to a manager 2:30pm but there was no answer.",

Second is that you can only get a single item and if you added on another item such as shrimp to your steak, then they charge you for that and then charge you a $17 add on charge on top of that. WTF? So for my wife and I both to add an extra item, we had to pay $34, for about eight pieces of shrimp each and then charged for the shrimp. I can get a full double entree meal at Benihana for that up charge! Then they want a tip on top of that? The food was not up to par either.

The seats are neon green and the furniture is super dated. I think if they changed the decor to a more modern feel they would get a lot more business and popularity. They also have a hibachi table which seemed to be very popular. I've ordered Osaka to go a few times and it's definitely better when dining in.

We ordered a roll and this was very good. I heard they have happy hour daily until 6pm, maybe I would come back and try more rolls during happy hour.  The restaurant's atmosphere is pretty nice!",

The shrimp was cooked early in the meal, but waited until all of my food was finished prior to eating.  By that time, the shrimp was cold.  The ribeye was good, but again, a small portion.  My husband ordered the scallops, which were undercooked.  We were celebrating his birthday.  At the end of the meal, they brought out some vanilla ice milk and sang holding to wooden signs painted \"Happy\" \"BDay\".  The whole meal took about an hour.  I enjoy the hibachi experience, but will look elsewhere next time.",

    "text": "I now understand why this place offers a Groupon and has 2.5 stars (3 stars too many).   To start off our night, we had a reservation at 6 pm. Apparently they know how to take a reservation, but have no idea how to honor them. At 6:45, we asked the hostess what was taking so long, instead of being accommodating, she offered attitude. We asked to speak with a manager, but was told no one  was in the restaurant. How on a weekend night, is there not a manager/supervisor on site?   An hour after our reservation, we were finally seated, but we waited another 15 before anyone was by to greet us. We asked the hostess if we could get a sling or high chair for our sons car seat and she was confused. My wife changed our son in the restroom, but they do not have proper equipment to do so. Once the waiter took our drink order, it took another 20+ minutes before he came back and took our food order.   While we waited and waited for food to be served to us, we watched the hibachi chef from behind having fun with the large group across from us. When he did finally come to our side of the grill, he started with a couple jokes, but then seemed to just want to get out of there. We order a couple NY Steaks and some scallops only to have to have him put it back on the griddle because they were still raw.   Lastly, the place was absolutely disgusting. Food everywhere on the floors and even large shards of glass as well. Be careful when setting things on the ground or having little ones around.   All in all, we will never be back again! A dinner we had reserved for 6 became a 3.5 hour adventure we'd like to never take again.",

    "text": "Groupon strikes again!!!!! This is a lot further than my usual local restaurants, but groupon made me do it! Lmao.   I was instructed, by groupon, to call and make a reservation.... But they didn't answer the phone at all during the 5 times I called. Even when I approached... I the hostess I mentioned the phones not working and I offered to call in front of her... It rang. This led me to believe they just didn't want to answer my call since it was an hour before closing.   Anyways.... We ordered Yellowtail sashimi  and baked green mussels as an appetizer. Both were delicious and fresh. Id prefer cilantro on my yellowtail as well as the jalapeno... But let's not be too picky. I'd also prefer a plate without a huge chip in it. It's about presentation as well as taste.   We sat at the teppanyaki table and J.R was our chef. I mentioned that I like my steaks medium, but I usually order my filet mignon medium rare due to it never being cooked right. He assured me he would make it right... Even gave me a taster, and behold... It was amazing.   Ordered an entree of scallops as well. They are medium size and you get about 10 per order.   Entrees come with Miso soup and ginger salad, hibachi shrimp and fried rice and veggies  All in all, if I make the long stretch to come back out to this location... I'll come back!",

There is no hours posted on door so we didn't know that. The only minor thing was soup was only luke warm which is not a great sign. Chef Jorge was totally engaging/fun and an attentive chef with a show. The food was decent for the price. Had the steak and chicken. Although its not an upscale restaurant it was overall good and taste. My only complaint is their prices are in line with better quality restaurants. Overall it was a good experience. Probably will return but I've got hundreds more to try in the valley. I'm a local who is a foodie so let the journey begin.",

    "text": "I frequent Hibachi grills on average about once a week because I personally just love it . This was my first time at Osaka  I made reservations on open table completely by accident my intentions were to go to Ojah down the street but since I had already sent everyone the address to Osaka we decided to eat there.  Biggest mistake I've ever made in my life !  I made reservations for 7pm I was one of the first to arrive so I checked in & the very rude hostess pointed me to the bar & advised that I wait there. Okay cool so my party is arriving & I ask her how much longer around 7:15 . She said \"Well is your whole party here?\" I told her no & she pointed me back to the bar around 7:18 My entire part was there so I went back to the hostess & her reply was \"When there's a table available then we will seat you\" I concluded that was fair b/c my party was about 20 mins late. But we didn't sit down until about 8:26 . When we FINALLY sat down they when we were served out soup & salad the waiter nearly spilled soup on 3 people & one person successfully since he was slamming everything on the table. There were no silverware present & most of the table had to swap drinks. The chef was very nice but I've never had food so bland in my life . The portion size was terrible everyone who got chicken legitimately got about 6 mini chunks of chicken on their plate & for the price that's completely unacceptable  The chicken was overdone & hard as well as the steak the shrimp was pretty good but the friend rice tastes like white rice equal to no flavor.  I mentioned on my reservation that there was a birthday in the party as we waited to get seated I watched the staff sing Happy Birthday at least 6 times & bring out ice for the birthday person none of that occurred when we sat down even though the hostess did double check if there was a birthday in my party Overall my check came up to about $130 for 2 people which I've never paid so much for hibachi in my life & it wasn't even worth the price or the 18% gratuity they tacked on that came up to $30  My experience was HORRIBLE ! The service was terrible from the time I walked in I should have known from that point to turn around but I wanted to give this place a shot . Do Not waste your hard earned dollars here b/c you will be upset & hungry when you leave !",

    "text": "Fist off, the fish was excellent! The cut rolls were tasty and the Ngiri was quite fresh. My sushi benchmarks are Yellow Tail which was a little on the mild side for me but quite fresh and firm with a bit of buttery-feel in the mouth. The Salmon was superb with the nice fatty richness I look for.  All that being said, my 3-star rating was based on 2 things: The portions here are probably the smallest suhi servings on the planet. The Ngiri slices were about 2/3 of what I would expect with the cut rolls being the size of a generic hot-dog (about 1\" diameter). I've never seen such small portions in the 50 or so sushi establishments I've been to. The other thing was the service. I got take-out and was told :20 minutes. It was more like :40 on a Saturday night. If it's to be :40, fine. I just need my expectation set.  I spent $50 (includes a 10% take-out tip) on 3 Ngiri and 3 cut rolls and was just satisfied ... with no leftovers. That's a three $$$ .. Yelp has them at two $$.  As an aside, the atmosphere was very noisy with little sound-supressing materials or design in the ceiling or walls. Also, the web site is misleading ... it's only for the Sahara location. The on-line menu does not apply to the Lake Mead locaiton ... I had 6 items picked out from the site and when I arrived with my list, they didn't carry 4 of them (Toro, Ebi, Aji and Las Vegas roll).",

    "text": "This was my boyfriend and my first time here- purchased a Groupon for $49... it stated on the groupon that you receive 2 dinners for up to a $32 value, an order of fried rice and two \"House drinks\" specifically saying \"beer, wine, or a well drink\" it all started when we tried ordering a house Mai Tai (which they should have considering it being a Japanese restaurant) well we were told we could only get beer or wine.... fine I got a glass of wine he got a beer. Next we decided to order our meals (up to a $32 value) he picked the chicken which was well under $32 and I happened to pick a $34 meal, thinking I would just have to pay the $2 difference and our server never told me anything different. Well salad came out which was horrible. Miso soup was pretty good. Usually this is the time I get my white rice, while watching our food being cooked but because this Groupon came with the fried rice, we had to wait for a while.... which was okay because it was really delicious. Our chef was really funny and entertaining but the staff was really rude and kept trying to take plates away from you throughout the whole meal. All and all the food was good, veggies could've been cut up smaller. Well now we get to the bill and I knew I had to pay my upcharge because I picked a meal that costed $2 more, but the bill said 13. I was confused so I asked the waiter and he said if you pick a meal it's automatically $10 upcharge then the remaining price of the meal you choose and TAX. I was so confused because I had already purchased this Groupon for 50 bucks and it really wasn't all that great. Wouldn't recommend and wouldn't go back.",

The Teriyaki Beef was always succulent and seasoned just right, the rice was perfectly steamed, and so on. Everything was always wonderfully done and nicely presented. It catered to three different crowds - sushi bar, teppanyaki, and regular dining - and managed to do so efficiently.  Recently things have changed. Service has become quite slow with uninterested wait staff. The food isn't presented as well and the portions have shrunk despite no change in price. The noise level is also pretty high, making it difficult to have a conversation. On my last visit the waitress seemed annoyed we wanted to use a coupon.  I will say the Ice Cream Tempura remains one of my favorite desserts. Unlike other locations, they add a layer of cake as a barrier between the ice cream and tempura for a totally different consistency. I recommend it, though maybe stop here for just dessert?",

    "text": "I have Osaka a few times but this was my first/last time at this location.   After purchasing a Groupon we had made a reservation for 7pm and arrived a few minutes early. We were told it would be 20 minutes or we could reschedule for another day. I found this interaction to be a little frustrating.   First off, we had a reservation and we were the only ones waiting for a table seemed a little unwelcoming. Secondly, the quick alternative of coming back another time felt like they didn't really care that we would have to wait or if we were even there. When it was time to get our table they said they could squeeze in with another group. I have no problem rubbing elbows but it was pretty tight and again it felt as if our reservation for 6 people had been given little notice or planning.   Supposedly, the restaurant was in the process of an AC change and it was not functioning properly so it was very hot before they even started cooking the food on an open flame a few feet in front of us. I looked at the other guests and noticed a few sweaty brows and then the family next to us actually requested the waitress lower the temperature and she said she would try to lower the temperature. More outstanding customer service shining through :-) In the end they brought over a fan which provided some relief.   The hibachi grill master showed up shortly after and did a wonderful job. He was entertaining and friendly while he prepared our meal. Unfortunately, everyone was pretty uncomfortable with the temperature and it took away from the experience.   As with the other locations, the food was excellent, however, there is a $10 or $15 upcharge for going over the price per entree of the Groupon. Our Groupon allowed for a $32 per plate entree per person. So if you wanted an item that would be $34 it would not be $2 additional it would be $2 plus the $10/$15 upcharge. This made no sense to me and just seemed like a way to gouge the customers.   It's hard to make an outright complaint when we came to eat and the food was great. However, the customer service leaves a lot to be desired and limited air conditioning in Vegas during July is just not acceptable. I am not sure if this is a temporary issue or an ongoing concern.",

A party of three was seated before us. One of the workers told us that we were skipped and we should had been seated before the party of three. Not to mention that the person seating us told our table was being prepared again 15 minutes ago((this was after we had to look for him). We asked to speak to a manager or someone in management and we were told that management was not available. We would have to try to contact management on Sunday. WOW!! Who is running this place...No one apparently. The workers do not even have anyone to call when issues arise. Oh well, my sister was treating us to dinner tonight. I guess we will try Montana Steakhouse.",

My reasoning for the three stars is the portions were small ( other than the fried rice) and we were sitting at the hibachi with 6 strangers, which  was slightly uncomfortable. It was a Friday night and two other hibachis were open but they said we had to sit there. Meanwhile, two more guests walked in and had there own. That was annoying! Our tab was about 300 and honestly for that we could have had a lot better.",

Which made us question the food since we were next to the kitchen & that's where the smell was coming from. There was also only one hibachi chef so the meal was very prolonged & we had to wait well past our reservation time. I understand that it's a weekday but maybe have 2 chefs so people aren't waiting so long. Again, usually we love this place but this time was too much. We will not be coming back.",

I don't feel it was seasoned as great as others I have tried, and service wasn't all that great. The restaurant itself is rather humid and doesn't seem that clean.   Aside from that, I still think the food was delicious and it was a fun experience overall! Without the Groupon deal I purchased, I probably wouldn't come back for it.

Once the cooking/show started, the chef was very nice and funny, but he OVERCOOKED nearly EVERYTHING because he was paying more attention to his list with everyone's order on it, and playing with the children at the table!

    "text": "We came here for my wife's Birthday; the following is my review based on my experience: Good: -The food is good, the prices are in line with what you would expect of this type of restaurant (a fair amount of people use groupon to cut the cost) the service is good. Portion sizes were good. The chef's did put on a good show.  Now the bad. For the prices you pay this restaurant definitely need a facelift. The outside makes it look really nice but the problems appear when you walk through the door (only one of which was working at the time of our visit) , the walls are dirty and could use a repaint, floors are dirty, the fume hoods above each of the tables could use a good cleaning (I could see a lot of rust just looking up) and the menus need to be replaced. The menues also need to be replaced. Ours were ripped in half and all of the menues at our table were in pretty bad shape and are also laminated and dirty. They look like menus you would get at a cheap restaurant, not one where you are spending on average 30 bucks or more for an entree, our bill was about $92.00 with tax, tip and drinks. We also had to ask the server to clear the dirty plates on the table, there is not a lot of room on those tables so you would think that would be a priority.   My overall view of this place is mixed.  I gave it three starts( actually it should be 2.5 but there is no rating for that)  because they could do better-much better if they repaint, do some cleaning and replace the cheesy menus. This is definitely not the place for a romantic dinner . It is a good place to take the family and if you have kids. Don't go if there are less than 4  because it is community seating.  As I said we went for my Wife's Birthday and were seated at a table with 4 adults, 2 kids and a breast-feeding infant. The people at our table were friendly but had I knew we would be seated like this I would have gone somewhere else for this occasion. Because of the cleanliness issues I don't think I will be back.",

I am a business owner and if we got one complaint I am on the phone instantly to try to resolve the issue, no wonder why they have to do coupons to keep the business running. The food is amazing our waiter Andrew was amazing however when ocean through our food at us and didn't even explain what it was Andrew came back and said it was the wrong order, unfortunately I just canceled reservations that we had had for eight people and I'm sure Osaka on Sahara would love our business!!!",

    "text": "I purchased a Groupon to dine here with my girlfriend. The place was pretty empty when we arrived. We were quickly taken to the only hibachi station with people sitting there, and were quickly asked what our order would be. Fortunately we had looked at the online menu so we didn't mind being rushed for our order. I should note at this point that my chair was broken/wobbly, but it didn't give way so I didn't complain. The chef came out (Jorge), introduced himself, confirmed everyone's orders, and proceeded to cook the food with the usual hibachi flair. The portions are ridiculously small, and cooked and served ridiculously quickly, and for what you get the place is ridiculously expensive. I like the word \"ridiculously\" tonight for some reason. Anyhow, we were there for approximately 35 minutes. That's how fast the food is served, and how small the portions are (you get through your small amount of food in a matter of minutes). The lady sitting next to me (not my gf) said, \"Well.... it looks like we are all done just in time to go home and cook dinner.\" Had I had to pay full menu price (I used a Groupon as previously mentioned) I would have been very annoyed at the high bill. Even with the Groupon I wasn't exactly happy. Entrees, which give you a little bowl of fried rice, a meager little slice of meat, and a watery fish-flavored soup with a micro-salad, average around $29. Way too much for a very rushed meal, which is better described as an appetizer. The one positive was that the little bit of meat (I got the filet mignon... or more actually a filet mignon shaving for $29) was very tasty... that's why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. My girlfriend got the sea scallops (8 little scallops for $32), which weren't great, but not too bad either. Anyhow, lesson learned. If money isn't an issue, but time is, and you ate before you came, this is the place for you.",

    "text": "I read all the reviews on Osaka in summerlin and I sort of knew what I was getting myself into. I only went because people had coupons and they insisted on going. So... here is the review.  This place is HILARIOUSLY bad. You know those really bad movies that are so bad they actually turn out to be good? Troll 2, Birdemic, Manos: The hands of fate...etc. I think those movies are the best metaphor for this restaurant. It was so bad, now I get to tell stories to people about how bad it was; and, what may seem like hyperbole in the crap department is the honest truth.  Starts out with making a reservation for a regular table (not teppanyaki) for 6:30. We get there and not surprisingly they hadn't written down the reservation. (once again, I read all the other reviews so I came in with no unknown variables). So the invalid girl at the front says, \"Oh sorry, it happens sometimes, I'll get you a table ready.\" NOT EVEN KIDDING. basically saying, \"Oh ya, we are screwups and we know it whatareyagonnado?\"   So we sit at the couch for about 15 minutes at which point we ask the troglodyte what happened to our table. (Mind you there is like 2 other groups in the entire restaurant) and the girl says, \"Oh wait, you wanted a table?\" And she was TOTALLY SERIOUS! \"Actually mam, I just decided it was in my best interest to sit on this uncomfortable couch in this eastern european level sweatbox to pass time.\"  I don't have enough room to go into everything about the service there, but just imply that the entire meal was more of the same... knocking over drinks, touching the ends of your hashi with their stank hands, not having shoyu, and just talking in a way that statements magically become questions using the higher inflection at the end of each sentence a la valley girl.  The food was SERIOUS garbage. I could understand this type of sushi coming from a $3.99 off strip all you can eat sushi buffet where people have just abandoned all hope of eating good food, but not from someplace that uses the name of a once stellar Vegas icon. Plus, it was super expensive for what it was.  Let me clear something up for the Osaka sushi chef (who I think was some kind of romanian perhaps?) Sushi only consists of 2 things: Vinegar rice (shari) and anything else (neta). Anyone who has ever had good sushi will tell you, the secret is cooking technique, quality and flavour of the rice; and freshness of the ingredient. Well, the rice had no vinegar in it... no flavoring at all...I would say it was of chinese take-out quality, but that would be offensive to chinese takeout. so... they basically missed 1/2 of the essential ingredients of sushi.    Next, the rice wasn't cooked properly. I think they just sort of dumped rice in with water and decided \"meh, that looks right.\" then put it in the dish steamer which is where, in my mind, I believe they cook the rice.  Finally, they didn't even roll the sushi correctly. Either they had the nori inside out, or the nori was so cheap it didn't have binding, but, before the plate had even gotten to my table, it had fallen apart. When I gave the server a look like \"wtf?\" she just shrugged and gave the, \"I hate my job anyway, nothing you can do or say will make me feel worse than I do already because I have to be here.\" look back at me.  The tempura was cooked with the technique of an 8th grade cafeteria apprentice, the batter clearly wasn't cooled because it was as greasy as it could get, and all the vegetables had the consistency of toxic-waste guy from robocop.   Lastly, people in party got sick.  Verdict: With the rise of really bad japanese restaurants in Las Vegas (with a few exceptions) maybe the new trend is going towards really bad sushi with a really steep price but drown out in blasting trendy music... But if you actually want my advice, stay far away from this place unless you want a hilarious story of caution about the downfall of the restaurant industry.",

    "text": "I had high expectations for Osaka, from the outside it looks like a high end japanese restaurant. As a local for 14 years, I've been to many japanese restaurants. We usually stick to the spring mountain area when we eat Asian. Perhaps this was my mistake. My husband and I came for dinner on a sat night. We ordered his favortie, the spicy tuna roll. It wasn't spicy at all. It tasted like just a tuna roll with one drop of tabasco. We both ordered the dinner bento box. The beef was cooked nicely, but we both agreed that the 'teriyaki' sauce was very muted, almost watered down. I think a teriyaki tv dinner would have had more flavor. The only reason why I gave 2 stars was because the tempura was alright. The dipping sauce for the tempura had absolutely no flavor, either. Our waiter was very attentive when it came to refilling our drinks. Maybe the teppanyaki is better, it has to be, otherwise how would they still be in business? I would advise against ordering the regular dinner menu.  Thanks the great ambiance, loud music and the free smells from the teppanyaki grils. But the food wasn't what I expected. More like something I would get from a no name fast food strip mall. I'll stay with chinatown. Nice try Osaka.",

It took about 20 minutes just to get our first sushi roll. The bento boxes we ordered were overpriced for what you've served, and half of it was cold by the time it got to our table. I will not be visiting the Summerlin Osaka in the future, and instead will stick with the Sahara Osaka, which has fast service, better prices, and is overall excellent, quite the contrary to this branch.",

We got our salads and soups, and then chef was about to start with just us when another couple walked in, so our server made him wait. We were pretty annoyed as we had already been waiting for 30 minutes and were starving. However, 10 minutes later the chef started, and we befriended the new guests and ended up having an awesome time. Our chef, Thurston, was amazing! He was super fun, and we all drank sake together and made great conversation. The food was TO DIE FOR. I ordered scallops and my boyfriend ordered the combo of steak and chicken. Thurston added shrimp to our fried rice. I think there were like 8 giant scallops in my order. It was SO MUCH food!!
