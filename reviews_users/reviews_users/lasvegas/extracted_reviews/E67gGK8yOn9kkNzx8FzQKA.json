Food is always amazing and servers are so polite here!! I'll definitely be coming back here! I love honest places",

What a better way to do it, by washing it down with cold beer. You really can't beat half off wings. It gets pretty busy, so expect to wait, or if you don't want to wait, order to go. My favorite is the garlic parmesan. Look out for the special flavors they have in the menu too! They always have seasonal flavors. If you like your wings extra saucey, ask for them extra wet! It's worth the flavor blast.",

All 3 of the servers we've had during our last 3 visits have been rude, short, & unaccommodating. When asked for ranch or water, after having been sat for over 17 mins, they react as though it's an inconvenience for them. When we were in a rush to drop off the check so we could leave, we approached another server to drop off our card to our server in the back, she responded with, \"Am I your server? No? Okay go ahead & go back to your table.\" We had this same blonde server during our last visit, & when I asked her why my salad came with grilled chicken when it's usually crispy, she responded in an accusatory way claiming that I had ordered wrong. Worst service unfortunately, which counteracts the best food. I'd understand if they were busy, but it's been dead every time.",

A group of friends and myself walked in and were looking for a friend that had already been seated (there was 7 of us) and when we found her, we went to go sit. The hostess comes by a few minutes later and her attitude was very nasty and let's us know that \"next time we come in, we can't just seat ourselves, we have to wait to be seated\" and just by her tone of voice and the way she stared at us ticked me off. We were looking for our friend that was already seated so her rudeness was completely uncalled for, she didn't apologize for her attitude and just continued to say \"next time, you can't just seat yourselves\". If you have such an attitude, maybe you shouldn't work in the customer service field, go somewhere else. The waitress was overall nice to us and our food was fresh and hot, so thank you to the nice waitress that helped us out after that nasty hostess.",

What I do like is the trivia game they have on the tv.  At my last visit we had a few cocktails and were playing trivia...all of a sudden all of our boards blanked out. One patron asked the bartender to reset the system (he had this happen at another facility).. The bartender got an attitude and claimed he couldn't do anything about it. After asking again, he went to a manager to find that the system could indeed be reset. The bartenders are very chatty and slightly slow to serve. I do like that the facility is non smoking...a rarity in Vegas! I will say the ladies bathroom is really dirty. It makes me wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen.. The bathroom could use a deep cleaning including having the grout cleaned. An obvious clue - when the grout on the floor is black and on the wall is a hundred shades lighter! Make sure to potty before coming here! I'll be back - main reason being for trivia...not for the food or service!",

The layout of the restaurant is nice and spacious with numerous large TVs lining the walls. The servers and bartenders are extremely friendly. They offer electronic trivia. When I asked for an extra side of sauce to go with my boneless wings they complied without charging me. They did however mess up my coworkers 'well-done wings' order, quickly fixed the mistake and comped his meal. If you are a Sriracha fan, they have a new wing sauce you can try dubbed 'Sizzling Sriracha!'

This location is GOD AWFUL. I have had constant problems with their phone systems for calling in orders, their staff for rudeness or just lack of service, and even their food. The last order I had tasted like it had sat for about 2 hours under a heat lamp, yet I'd only sat and waited for it for about 15 minutes after placing the order.   Tonight, their phone system kept saying it was busy, yet I walk in and there are no orders waiting, and no employees on the phones. I asked what was going on, thinking maybe something was wrong with the phones, and they said they only have one line. One line?! For a place with a takeout option?????  Last visit, I tried to use a birthday coupon that was 1 day expired and the manager literally huffed, puffed, and scoffed at me before honoring it. Sorry, I'll pay the $4 next time to avoid the mistreatment.   Awful. Just awful.   Probably going to drive the extra mile to the Warm Springs location going forward. This place is a joke.",

I also liked that the place was well lit and had good music playing it gave off an upbeat vibe. There are huge televisions on practically every wall playing sports but if you are like me and not into that they have these game machines at the bar. These aren't the poker machines which bore me to death ( they have those too) but they were just fun video games that were free. It was a good way to the pass the time while we waited on our food which came out pretty quick. My husband and I shared Nachos and the Blackened Chicken Salad. The Nachos were light and crispy they had jalapenos, cheese , chili, sour cream etc on them. It didn't give you that heavy feeling after eating it . It was really good even though I tend to stay away from chili. I liked that the chili wasn't piled all over the chips you can eat this without getting messy . The salad was also delicious ..the Blackened Chicken was nice and tender and had roasted garlic on it. it. The salad had tomatoes, red onion, croutons and creamy ranch dressing. The quality of the food was top notch for the price you are paying. I would like to come back in the near future and try their wings!",

    "text": "Im really frustrated with restaurants that specialize in something and run out of the only thing on the menu that they specialize in. This has happened more than once so therefore Im writing this. I went here last night for a quick munch. I dont even look at the menu since it has and will always be a honey bbq wings.. Traditional yes I said it. Traditional. No and I might add that a girl is not so traditional eating the wings but hey I like to get dirty sometimes.. lol  As I ordered the wings the waitress informed me that they have no more wings. I was heart broken so I decided to order something else which I was more disspointed in. Im only giving this a 3 star because bww and I go back way back. So we have some history. But I will have to severe my relationship with BWW. Im so sorry",

Not great by any means but sometimes my man needs some wings in his life.   Tonight we decided to dine in and unfortunately it was all down hill. For starters the restaurant is filthy. Tables aren't being cleaned off and trash all over the floors. There's a lot of people who work here but nobody cares to clean it up and make it look presentable.   The girl who served us was very nice but didn't pay attention to drinks being down to nothing and we had to ask several times for refills.   The food was the major disappointment. The only thing that tasted very good were the cheese curds that came out nice and hot. The wings tasted stale and everything was over breaded on the them and the veggies were really old.   It's a fun & loud atmosphere but nobody is paying attention to the details. Too bad :(",

We received our appetizers then about 45 minutes later Hector our server asks us \"Did you receive all your food already?\" UH no we did not. Then he said it would be right out. Another 15 minutes goes by and he starts to blame it on the kitchen that the order was not put in and that the manager was fixing it. Well who is the manager? I don't even have a name because the manager did not once at all present himself/herself to take care of the situation or even apologize. Now it's time for the bills. First the checks weren't even split correctly so here goes another 15 minutes. Then the \"On the house drinks\" that Hector promised after the long wait for the food we're still billed. We ignore it give him our payments and here goes another 20 minutes! So bad service, horrible timing for everything, and obviously bad management since they couldn't even have the audacity to present themselves for an apology. This location has definitely lost 6 customers that will never return here ever again! If you can avoid this place I recommend going to a different location.",

I understand my 400 bucks a year is just a minuscule drip in their revenue but I'm DUN done with them.   Last evening we ordered our normal 4 meals and had it picked up by Postmates. It was delivered. My son and I enjoyed our crispy tender meals but my wife was still at work.   When she got home she was tired and ready for a meal and I had ordered her the naked tender meal. She has always been finicky about chicken but she had great luck with Buffalo WW in the past. When she cut into the tender last night there was a green color in the tender. It turned her stomach and said get your money back.    I wrote an email requesting a gift card for the amount of her meal or refund for that meal the person on the other end asked for photos and I sent them. He then asked for a receipt and I explained that I had ordered through Postmates and they had forgotten the receipt but my order consisted of such and such. He then said you will need to get a refund from Postmates.",

    "text": "My Husband and I have been coming to this location since late 2004 when my husband and I just started dating, before I moved here, waaaaay before smart phones were the norm and Yelp had an app on smart phones-- you had to go on your phone web browser to access Yelp... Long time right? And on my most recent visit to this location on Tuesday, 6/21/2016, I dec'd that was going to be my last visit to this location and here's why...  I just got out of work, it had been a stressful week and it was only TUESDAY and I wanted to have an adult beverage or 5. We walked through the doors at 6:30pm and at this point and I knew that HH ended at 7pm so there was not much time to order at HH prices. We did not realize that there was a soccer game on the tele and the place was not boxing match or football busy but mighty busy for a Tuesday. We opted to sit at the bar and we were able to snag the last two seats next to one another and luckily they were the cushy chairs.  Around 6:45pm we placed our orders for drinks and food. I ordered a beer and street tacos via HH menu and hubs ordered a water and 6 wings. T'was 6:57pm and I tried several times to grab the attention of our server/bartender behind the bar to place our orders before HH ended but... They were sooooooo behind on drink orders that they had 2 people manning the draft beers (they were in such a hurry that those beers had so much head, it was gross), one being one of the managers from what I could tell. Needless to say, I was not able to get another drink before HH ended. That's fine, not angry, I ordered food and I'll be happy once I consume it.   Now it's 7:25pm... No food. Being as hangry as I was, I grabbed the attention of another server/bartenders and let her know what was going on. She proceeds to tell that \"we're noticing that it's taking about 45 mins for food.\", no apology, no heads up 20 mins ago, no comp drink, NOTHING. Hubs tells her that \"we'll pay for the beer\", she tries to tell us the food should be out soon but we're not having any of it anymore, this is fucked up. I'm hangry and at this point, so is my husband. Our server/bartender gives us tab for $4+, he leaves a $5 and we skidaddle.   We've been here to watch football, basketball, baseball, boxing matches, UFC fights and sometimes just to eat and not watch anything at all. There were times that the place was filled to the gills, people were shoving people for space (in the bar) and people would get into tiny scuffles w/ one another from there being no space or simply from being liquored up, one time someone tried to fight w/ the manager. There was a time when some idiot was so drunk he dec'd that it was a good idea to grab me where he shouldn't have... And yet we returned no matter the experiences we had w/ the riff raff bc the service was always on point. My husband and I have become friends w/ some of the servers (some who no longer work here) so this day was a real \"WHAT THE FRACK\" experience. We're not coming back, not even for late night eats/drinks which was always my favorite. Not one time for as long as we've been coming here in 10+ years have we experienced such shitty service, never rec'd our food, and not one person was apologetic about it. I mean, the server/bartender spat out a very forced \"sorry\" but by the look on his face basically said that he didn't give a crap.   This was THE worst experience we've ever had here and will NOT come back.    #byefelicia",

Even when I try to get his attention, he would pretend not to see me. He picks and choose who he wants to service, and I'm not one of them. When he feels like it, it's like he is force to get the refill or the food I order. The way he talks to people, you can tell he doesn't care. He is rude and disrespectful to the other customers as well. I even overheard him blame another bartender for his own mistake! He has his moments of pissy mood and starts to slam things down. He has the attitude of I don't give a f&$k attitude! The only good thing he is good at, from what I seen, is to scare the customers off, and constantly disappearing!",

When I arrived, the room wasn't ready, but the greeter and I were able to move tables so our group could sit together. Our server, Dionne (not sure if I spelled it correctly) was INCREDIBLE and took care of getting appetizers out and drinks served right away. There were about 13 of us and she took our orders efficiently and checked on us frequently. Everyone's food was hot and fresh, and drinks were cold. Everything tasted great. She even reminded me about my rewards points when it was time to check out. Dionne was professional, friendly, and provided exceptional service. She even turned on the Dodger game in the room so my daughter, who is a huge fan, could watch Game 1 of the series. We all had a great time celebrating my daughter and her fiance! Even though this location is on the other side of town, I will drive there because the serve is worth it.",

It's difficult for me to hear my friends over the televisions and occasional yelling kids.  I typically order boneless chicken.  I noticed that they added shrimp po-boys to the menu.  The first time I wanted to order one BWW (a different location) was \"sold out\" of the shrimp.  The second visit months later at this location I was able to get one.  I was surprised how tasty it was and I ate the whole thing!  Portions are adequate and prices are agreeable.  Very good customer service and the bathrooms were clean.  In order to make it a five star experience (at any BWW) they need to lower the volume on the multitude of televisions.",

It was couple of hours ago(5/23/2017), I went to this location to dine-in but the place quite busy because of Tuesday promotion which I didn't even noticed. I was too tired to wait and make an take out order. cashier Mechanzie was really sweet and didn't take that long to wait for pick up. Everything was so good by then. I came home and open the box and start eating. After couple of wings, I noticed one of the wing is extremely stringy. I felt something different. and pulled away and found clump of feathers. I was so embarrassed and start throwing up since I ate one of them. It was horrible and really disgusting.  (I attached a picture which might hard to figure out since sauce is all over and feather does not look as we know. BUT this is FEATHERS!!!!! )After that, I called into location and same cashier forward to manager Daniel( I am not sure of his name) He said he will give me credit of 5 wings for next time but it is not what I wanted LOL. I do not want that experience at all!!!!!! I don't know if human can eats feathers but for me, I never heard of it. I also googled and figure out it was not only me and hopefully no one could experience no more. It was terrible experience and no one wants to have that experience I believe.  I don't think I can go back but just want to make sure that the company knows what is going on their foods.",

The one on the strip gets way too crowded & doesn't have as much sauce quality like this location. & the north location is far from me. Buffalo wild wings has some of the best wing sauces I know. I'm a spice lover, so I recommend mango habanero, Thai curry, & spicy garlic. If you're lucky, you can try one of their limited time sauces. For sides, its hard for me to jot order buffalo chips with cheese. They're pretty much good potato sliced wedges. & as for dessert, the typical brownie with vanilla ice cream is satisfying. Although buffalo wild wings is nationally popular, some may not have tried it. Might as well go for it in Vegas! Its not expensive & yummy.",

I never have to wait, food is never cold, and they get it right the first time BUT everytime I get wings from here I always regret it because 45 mins later I'm spraying all over the toilet bowl. I always have diarrhea and it doesn't help that I order hot wings either. I like eating BWW but blowing the toilet out 2 to 3 times in 2 hours and having to clean the aftermath isn't worth it. I'd consider giving them 4 stars if they hook it up with some toilet paper the next time I order from them. Other than that, they cool.",

We also watched the US vs Panama in the Gold Cup final; my daughters were into the game because everyone else was.  All in all a great experience; my kids are asking to go back already.",

We stood there for about 5 minutes before being sat. The host person was on the phone taking an order and said she would be with is in a few minutes. A server came over and asked if it was just us and said it's going to be a wait because he's cleaning the table. I said it was fine as long as we get our order in before the lunch special ends. He looked at the clock and it's 1:55, he said if the computer will let him he will. I was really not happy because if the computer will let him what??? Ummm not. I told him it better let him because we have been waiting to be sat and we were here before the end of the special. The server walked away and the host sat us. We got sat in the same servers spot and submitted our order. The meal went okay until we needed refills. Waited 10 minutes before I got frustrated and asked the host girl if she could get our drinks. She said ok but walked away and never got them. I seen her tell the server a few moments later. The server came over and asked if we would like a box. Of course I said no I just wanted a refill of my drink. He walked away came back with a tray full of drinks and asked what I was drinking again. So I told him. Finally 15 minutes later I'm not thirsty anymore.  I tell you. To not check on ur tables within 15-20 minutes or at least walk by not very good service. Hopefully I don't get him again.",

Customer service is usually just okay, better when you actually go in, sit down and eat, especially in the bar. Today I placed 3 separate orders over the phone. When I arrived, they forgot part of the first order so I had to wait there for them to make it, in the middle of my work day. When I got back to work, we found I was shorted a ranch that I had paid for, and my coworker found that his wing order was short about 5 wings so we called in and spoke with a helpful manager, Daniel, who offered to remake the order.   My coworker went back to the BWW to pick up his order and, when he asked for the ranch that they had forgotten, they refused to give it to him because it wasn't on that receipt.  Lol  are you kidding me? He mentioned it was on a separate order and they really wouldn't give him one side of ranch valued under a dollar. At this point it became laughably bad to just about everyone in our office.   There are plenty of other BWW locations around the valley with awesome servers & hosts who treat customers as they should be treated, unlike this one. If you feel like wings but don't want to waste your time & money at this location, just go to the one on Durange since they're always great.",

Two of my favorite things about this place:   1. They had hockey on. Usually when there are other games going on, hockey is only on one tv in a sad little corner everywhere else. This place featured it in the big screen.  2. The SHRIMP TACOS! Please don't ever take it away. It's a new feature on their menu and OH MY GAHHHH, so good!   Two things I absolutely hated:  1. Our waitress sucked. She was serving the two other tables seated behind me and she kept sitting down in one of the booths to flirt with her bf IN THE MIDDLE OF HER SHIFT! My friend waited 10 mins for her ranch because we couldn't get her attention. I forgot her name but she was this petite girl with a Hawaiian like name. Blonde/brunette hair.  2. The table and booth we sat in was sticky. The utensils had water marks and they're stingy on water. Terrible!",

As he was 2 minutes from our house they called me and said that they switched his order with someone else's and that he should come back and get his original order. He drove back and waited another 20 minutes for the order to be ready for it to be wrong again in the store. Finally got it home and they gave us all drums instead of all flats, and BLAZIN wings instead of Desert Heat. How do you accidentally give someone BLAZIN wings?!?! 1 Star for the nice Wolfpack member. Taking business to Wing King from now on.",

They put the dressing on the side WHICH EVERY restaurant should do, and the sauce on the wings was delicious.

This particular location does not have a host stand so I normally seat myself where ever I see fit. A waiter normally comes around. Seating at the bar calls for faster service of course.   The cheese curds are so good! If you haven't had those, you need to order them right now! Anyways, just another B Dubs!",

Our waiter didn't even give us eye contact throughout the entire duration of our stay; she looked like she would rather be somewhere else. When we came in, there were only 4 other families seated at the restaurant so there was no way she could have been swamped with orders. Our server took a long time to get to us, so we had to ask other servers to help us out during our stay. For a non-busy day, I feel like we should have gotten some better service",

Firstly, when the server dropped our check off with our to go boxes she put the check tab on top of the open box... where we would be putting our food. How many people per day do you hand that thing to? Disgusting. Health code violation. I digress. Next, my boyfriend got the nachos and the red onion was cut so big no one would want to eat that. It's always diced on nachos... but even if it's sliced it needs to be cut down a lot smaller. Could've cut it better myself. Service was slow and non-attentive, ended up paying in cash after we waited for the server for over 10 minutes. Only saw the server when it was obligatory, to take our order, give us our food, & set the check down.. nastily. The other server was on the floor almost the whole time. Didn't get their names because I quite frankly don't come here enough to care. Thought the review may be helpful to management if anyone cares.",

My bf and I like to keep it casual, and stuffing my face with wings and enjoying a beer and watching some baseball on Friday nights is just exciting and relaxing enough after a week of work to enjoy. Gotta love the medium sauce! Mild has a lot of flavor without being spicy and honey bbq is pretty good too. Avoid ordering mixed drinks though, it's a waste of money because they're so watered down... so just get some beer. Who can resist beer and wings? Not this girl!",

Nothing fancy or gourmet about this place, but you can get wings, popcorn shrimp or anything else that tickles your food baby.  I would recommend staying away from the Parmesan Garlic wings. They came out crispy and overcooked. When we asked the server to bring us a new batch, they tasted turrible. Everything else though? Awesome.  Beer selection is pretty good. Everything from your mass domestics, to some craft. Try a Sierra Nevada or Sam Adams Boston Lager with something really spicy. It'll change your life.  Bathrooms are amazing! Each standing stall in the Men's room had a TV. Nothing better than watching TV while you finish up.  Also, the best part? PLENTY of TV's. My friends were more interested in the Laker game, so they watched that, while I watched the Jazz game. We all sat at the same table, and were still able to be social with each other because we were surrounded by TV's.  One last thing. It's 24 hours! Holler.",

We only ordered a couple drinks and an appetizer sampler, but the waitress was sure to tell us all her favorites on the menu and make a lot of suggestions before we ordered. Next time, I'll definitely come down for some happy hour specials. They seem to have a lot of good deals everyday, like lunch specials immediately followed by happy hour.

Since May I think I've been to this location 5 times, and have had some minimal ups and downs.  Getting seated and situated is never problem, and neither is ordering, but once you get your food (which  takes longer then it should), it seems as though the waiter/tress just forgets about you and never stops by (and this as happened on a couple occasions).  As for the food - the wings are where it's at. They're delicious, and the sauces make them reach a level no other wing has reached. 14 delicious sauces, and they can also be used with chicken tenders, sandwiches and so on.  So besides wings (and chicken tenders), I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which I was really excited about, as I love pulled pork, and it came with the hot bbq sauce as well. But when I got it, it was a disappointment. The bread seemed dry, the sauce wasn't up to par, and even the pulled pork seemed dry! I learned my lesson, stick with wings!  And for those planning on doing the Blazin Challenge, if you pass, you still have to pay $5 for the shirt, it's no longer free.",

I should have known better than to order ribs at a non-BBQ place so I have no one to blame but myself. The ribs were small, rubbery, tasteless, and full of fat.

When he gives me new bill I payed and he threw the change on the machine I was sitting at then walks off back to his golf game. I come to this location often due to it being close to home. I will not be returning here or encouraging anyone else I know to come and receive shit service. This guy is a scum bag and would prob be making better tips and selling more for the company if he didn't have his head shoved up his ass. Only Thing decent was the food, so props to the chef. The bartender on the other hand should be fired. I'll be calling tomorrow to speak to a Mang and follow up on this BS that was called service.",

    "text": "Oh how the once mighty have fallen...  Buff-Wild as I call them, used to be my go-to late night boneless wings venue since 2008.  The tasty flavors I loved like honey bbq, Asian Zing, and teriyaki, sided with favorite like pickle chips, mozzarella sticks, or garlic mushrooms, and washing it all down with a cold refreshing Diet Pepsi.  My bartender/server Brian always kept me in good sprits even when I was down always refilling my glass and stopping by to shoot the sh** whenever he was free to do so.  But over the last year, the service, the quality of food, and the pricing have all gone waaaayyyyy downhill.  Charging for condiments shouldn't be a \"thing\".  Ranch and bleu cheese shouldn't be priced if they compliment the meal.  It's like putting a price tag on the ketchup bottle at the table and charging $.25 a drop.  It's ridiculous.  The service at the bar has changed their staff so much now that they all appear to be tired college students that look just absolutely miserable and hardly even give you any kind of 2nd glance if you need something.  Recently I went there and asked my server for ranch dressing since she forgot it.  I asked her a 2nd time...  I asked her a 3rd time...  I eventually finished the meal without the ranch and when I got my receipt, I found there was a charge for ranch!  WTF?!  But, the be all end all of this was last night.  I thought I'd give it one more shot after having not visited the place in almost 5 months.  I walked in after driving for Uber around 3:00 AM.  The bar was empty and one guy was tending.  I asked for the garlic mushrooms and a snack size portion of boneless wings flavored honey bbq and Asian Zing.  The chicken was AWFUL!  It used to be nice and chewy and not so crispy and hard!  It was honestly like chewing down on sharp tree bark that you hoped wouldn't cut and slice your mouth!  The only saving grace throughout the ordeal was the Diet Pepsi I had to wash it all down.  I love Diet Pepsi so there's really no way that anyone could screw that up, unless it's been too watered down or it's just overly carbonated.  But alas, nothing good can stay I guess and whoever is managing now should've taken some cues from the crew that was there running the place from 2008-2014.  I think the best time was when that young blonde woman with the glasses was managing.  I don't know who is managing now, but it's definitely in need of a shot in the arm.  Nice knowing you Buff-Wild...thanks for the good times.",

This was not juicy, sorry would not order that,  if I cannot get my burger the way I prefer?

Our server had a issue with us asking for prices on beer. She gave us this rude hand gesture saying \"lowest is $6 highest is $9\" we asked for certain prices on certain beers and she just says \"It varies\" so we just ordered. Gf got a blue moon I got A Coors light. We ordered our food. We ordered the medium traditional w/3 sauce types: buffalo blue moon bbq and teriyaki. When they brought our food out we didn't have our buffalo. Only had the the other two. To top it off they had all our wings on 1 platter mixed together not knowing what was witch. My gf didn't want the teriyaki but we had no choice but to guess what was what. We told em about the buffalo we didn't have. He took the platter back then brought it right back and brought out 4 buffalo wings. I've never been to BWW where they bring out your wings on one platter with more than one flavor. To top it off we had maybe 5 wings on that entire platter that were bbq. Just bad. Our plan was to be there for the entire game we were watching but after the poor service we left right after the 1st qtr and went to another place to watch the game.  I'm not gonna put names of servers/waitresses because that shouldn't matter. Poor service is poor service and it reflects on just the individual but the entire staff",

It's not every server here, the ones who have worked here for a while aren't bad.. but this location has such high turnover that it's ridiculous. The new staff is always rude.  Today was the final straw for us to come and sit and eat at this location. We'll gladly take a 5 minute extra drive to Warm Springs. They are super close to my house so I would still use them for take out, because the double check the orders before you take them home. At least at home I don't have to deal with rude servers. Tuesdays are busy, we understand, but we asked for a booth and we waited our time for it. They sat us at a table and we had stated that we requested a booth and had pointed to an open booth that was just being cleared. The gentleman than stated that the booth was for a party that had just walked in the door and put their name on the list WELL after we had been waiting.  We had asked how that was so when we had been waiting and he brushed us off and had us seated at the table right near the door. This was unacceptable. We saw another booth being cleared and requested to change to it immediately. Finally, they obliged. At this point, the waitress seemed annoyed and barely came back to check on us. I never received a refill on my water (ridiculous).  The only reason this is receiving 2 stars is because I love B-dubs food. The service sucks at this location. Try your luck elsewhere.",

CONS:  Prices are high for the level of quality you're getting.  Speaking of which, the quality is not always consistent.  Some wings have no sauce or very little sauce on them after being tossed in sauce in the kitchen.  Buffalo \"chips\" that are described on the menu with a word like crispy is False.  They are usually greasy, floppy and soft.    They've got to be understaffed, because the service is usually slow, even though you see your server running around like a madman (or woman.)  Hate that they upcharge for an amount of sauce that should come with the orders (for 10 wings, you get 1 sauce and 1 celery or 2 sauces.)  Don't like that when you play the trivia type games, you have to wait so long in between each round for tons of commercials/ads.   When you get there for pick up after ordering online,  you'll almost always wait 10 to 20 minutes past whatever was quoted to you online.  Kinda crazy.",

Mostly for the family.  2) A massive wet bar where you have poker machines with high tops tables surrounding. massive TVs are placed all around the bar so you won't be able to miss a game 3) An entertainment room for birthday parties etc. This room also is used for alot of fantasy football and baseball fantasy leagues to draft from. They can supply you a tv for your use.  BWW is great, the service and food is also at a high standard and it has been very rare that something has gone astray here.  Also on big game days like Super Bowl etc it's gonna be packed. There is always some special on wings and beer. For sure a place to visit.  Overall Food: 4-5 Drink: 4-5 Service: 4-5 Coming back: yes",

    "text": "Bdubs will always be one of my favorite places to eat at. I always go to Durango and Warn Springs, but last night my husband and I switched it up a little. We show up at 10:55 pm. Tried going through the front but the door was locked. A girl with long black straight hair, red lipstick, and a purple bdubs shirt went to the front to take a call, looked up and saw us outside trying to open the door knocking on the door trying to get her attention, and looked away again. Excuse you??? She just left us as if we weren't even there. Turns out we had to go through the door in the bar area, but I didn't remember until after. She could've pointed towards the other door or even helped slightly but the dumb ass bitch just ignored us.   We sat down at the bar as usual. Bartender took our drinks order and I ordered my garlic mushrooms appetizer. He went and was putting it in the system. It was pretty busy last night but not over bearing. Bartender told us whenever we needed him to just call him over since there was a good amount of people there. I love it, not bothering us at all but will be there when wanted. He was pretty nice, didn't get his name but he was taller and had some tattoos on his arms. Good service. He got our food order perfectly too. Most of the times they forget something, but he didn't. I got traditional small all flat parmesan garlic wings. The food didn't even take long coming out either. I usually hate the French fries at bdubs, but I really liked them last night! So all in all it was a pretty good experience, but the girl in the front really pissed me off. Super disrespectful and should honestly be talked to about her attitude. Honestly probably won't be back at this location because of her.",

I went on a Thursday while the Raiders & Chiefs were playing and they were having a boneless wing special. The place was pretty busy, but they had plenty of spaces for everyone.   I like how the bar is located further to the back of the restaurant and the numerous amounts of available seating.  After sitting down at our table, we were greeting by a young waiter who was friendly and attentive to everything we needed. We ordered our wing, beer, and sides and the food was put in no time.

I absolutely love their parmesan garlic sauce on traditional wings. Desert heat, honey bbq, and chipotle bbq are all solid choices as well. The servers are very friendly and attentive. I've come here with small and large parties and have usually gotten great service.  It may just be me, but I HATE their boneless wings, which is what is holding back the last star.

We stood at the host stand for a good 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. And there were 4 employees in front of us. One was taking a to-go order and the other three were chatting and trying to figure out how to set up a table for 8. Does it really take 3 people to figure that out? And couldn't you at least welcome us? Finally, the lady taking the to-go order finished and sat us..  Our server took forever to get to us. We were long ready by the time she finally got here. While waiting for our food, I finished my drink. Our server was at another table, so the manager/supervisor (?) brought us our food. I was waiting to see if she would offer me another drink. She didn't... Very professional of a manager. So we flagged down our waitress and she finally brought me a refill.   And the best part you ask? We were seated right next to a POS. The manager was standing there most of the time, gossiping with the waitresses. Couldn't really hear, but by body language and the giggles, it seemed like they were talking crap about guests.  I will stick to my original location where I am not ignored and where the employees don't gossip in front of guests.",

It took 20 minutes before a server gave me a menu or took a drink order.  2. I noticed one server on the other side of the restaurant was attentive with his guests, so I picked up and moved to his station. Within 2 minutes, Brian gave me a menu and took my drink order. If I every return it will be because Brian was a terrific server.  3.  I was not prepared for all of the football games to be turned off the big screens in favor of an MMA fight.

    "text": "I'm not one to frequent restaurant chains, but I have to admit that I do love me some buffalo wings from B-Dubs. I usually order the wings to go, but when I don't feel like making a mess at home, we'll dine in. Even on game nights (which I think is every night, they have like 50 screens with different games playing) there is never a wait, the place is so big.   I always order the traditional wings with hot sauce and a basket of potato wedges with cheese. Sometimes I order the boneless wings, with hot sauce as well. I would recommend you order them extra wet, sometimes they scrimp on the sauce.    On another note, be aware that the speed limit is 35 mph, not 45, despite the fact that it is not a residential area. I found out the hard way. Yikes.",

    "text": "Okay. It was Saturday afternoon and just found out the Pacman/Marquez fight would only be showed at MGM properties.  We called around town.  New York New York, Aria, Monte Carlo and Planet Hollywood all had the fight.  Unfortunately they were charging around 65 to 80 bucks cover just to watch; not including food, drinks and not guaranteeing a seat.  With three girls and four guys that would be rough. With our prospects not looking good.  We called on a friend to look it up on the internet.  Coming through, she tells us that the fight would be showed at Buffalo Wild Wings and there is no cover.  No cover!  Score.  We get directions and head over.  We are not locals of Vegas so going west of the strip is foreign to us.  We have only gone as far as the Orleans, Rio and In and Out Burger and that is it.  But we get there in one piece and before the fight starts and that's all that mattered. The crowd inside was mixed.  We went there to see Pacquiao win.  More than half of the patrons were going for the other guy.  Proof is when my son came in with a Filipino flag on his back and people were booing. The cool thing about this place was that they had all the sports on-  College Football (Oregon VS Stanford especially), UFC (dos Santos VS Velasquez) and the fight.  It was nice seeing everywhere you looked a big screen with sports.  That night was a good night for sports. We got a table that was perfectly placed by the bar.  We were also near a bathroom.  We had great service and the fight ended up being good but unsatisfying.  I want to see another rematch.  The wings were awesome and the drinks were good.  We had a great time.  This place is a winner.",

    "text": "If it was noon (lunchtime) on a Sunday when the NFC championship game was playing........don't you think they'd staff appropriately knowing that there would be a crap load of people?  Not BWW.  We were seated quickly, then waited 15 minutes and no one came over to us at all.  I know it was 15 minutes because I checked what time I checked in on Yelp (handy little app).  Also, a table that sat after us had already been brought their drinks.  I went over to the hostess stand where a manager was actually standing and asked him if the waiter knew we had been seated.  His response was an annoyed, \"Yeah, we're getting ready to send someone over there.\"  You're getting ready?  For 15 minutes?  So finally our waiter, Ronnie, saunters over to the table and takes our drink orders.  Then he shuffles away.  The drinks come....and he forgot my friend's Shirley Temple.  We'd like to tell him but he ran away as soon as he dropped them off even though we were ready to order by then.  We finally order when we flag him down and remind Ronnie about the Shirley Temple.  And we wait........then we ask the hostess to go get the drink because, what do you know, Ronnie forgot it again.  Now, I don't want you to think I'm being a bitch and this was just a fluke service accident.  So I offer you this other evidence: the couple sitting behind us pulled a manager over because they were having the same issue.  In fact, they set a freaking timer on their phone to prove how long they had waited.  And then there was a third table beside us who complained about a missing beer and had the manager come over.  Hmmmmmmmmm, if three tables in the same section are having issues with the waiter and the amount of time it is taking to even acknowledge customers....don't you think they'd call in more people?  The horrible service left us in a bad mood as we left early at the half.  We would have stayed to watch the whole game and ordered more drinks and food, but, sadly, Ronnie was no where to be found.  So we left and took our business elsewhere.",

    "text": "The birthday boy cried... And he's 29!! What a mess!! Their hiring process must include a Plinko Board.   Bottom Line First: Buffalo Wild Wings has boring food that apparently takes 12 minutes per wing to prepare, a crap beer selection, which is way over prices,  and customer service training comparable to the Nevada Highway Patrol.   If you like wings, don't eat here. If you like your friends and family, don't bring them here.  My next Yelp! List will be PLACES THAT ARE BETTER THAN BUFFALO WILD WINGS.  I have been to this Buffalo Wild Wings about 20 times in the last few years. My friends in the area love it, so we go frequently. Every time we visit this location, everything goes wrong.   I came here for a friend's birthday party and I kept my mouth shut while in the restaurant as to not create a scene.   Our table waited 50 minutes for the wrong food to come out twice. I ordered to go, as I had to leave the party for work. I even paid when I ordered. Our server, shorted my  change and still stressed that gratuity was not included in my total. I didn't make a big deal over it. Every time she came over, she said that mine should be right out. I wanted to cancel it, but again, did not want to make a scene.  I pointed out a bag that had been sitting by the register for 20 minutes. It turns out that this WAS my order. She had it remade, which made me really uncomfortable.   She tried to make a joke out of it, not understanding how difficult it is for me to not be mean sometimes. She did not offer to refund the food cost or offer anything additional either, she just said \"well you have somewhere to be, so get out of here.\"  The food, which I had to eat on my rushed drive was spilled all over the bag and was not hot. The napkins in the bag were soaked from the spilled sauce. It was the typical, half-assed Buffalo Wild Wing garbage food with no veggie sides.  (I will spell check this later)",

It was a packed house, but service was good and we got our food quickly. Since it had been a while I had to see if the wings tasted the same. Yes they do, my complaint about BWW remains the same, they need crispier wings. I got them with Parmesan Garlic sauce which I really liked. I got to go back and buy a bottle for making wings at home. Got some fries, they were average skinny cut fries. Tried oneof my friends Fried Pickle chips, they were good, nice and crispy. IMO prices of BWW is too high, Wing Tuesdays is the way to go and get them cheaper. I've found better wing places in town so there isn't much bringing me back to BWW.",

When we were being brought to our seats there was a family of three in a booth & we would've sat across from them in same booth. That seemed awkward so we asked about it & hostess said it was family style because it's fight night this is how they seat unless you are at the bar. Maybe it was wrong of us to assume what family style meant but I think that management should reword what they have their hosts explain this. Perhaps say because it's fight night you may be seated with another party so it's more clear.",

He is the best server at BWW. He is more attentive and patient and understands people. I have had him as a server at least 5 times and each time he is a professional and GREAT! Even with a party of 15 teenagers he was great! JD is the best server and he deserves to make more money and better tips than BWW allows.   For the rest of the staff, they are subpar. They rarely fill up water and don't care about the customers.   Buffalo Wild Wings is my favorite restaurant! I love their food! I just wish their staff was as great as JD!",

He brought out our food and never brought us silverware or  ranch. I flagged him down 20 mins later, and his response was that \" I keep forgetting I have a table back here\" my son was sooo hungry he started eating with his hands! He ended up bring out fresh food and silverware.. FINALLY.  Our bill came and I asked if he could take off a meal since it took FOREVER and he went and asked. He came back and told me that his manager took off our to go order and that he would comp our appetizer. He then said \"your bill will BE LIKE 23$\" I gave him two 20$ bills and he was off. I could tell he didnt know how much change to give me but he brought it back and quickly walked away. Inside I found 7$!!! 7$!! OK our bill was initially 31$, I shouldve got back 9$ but since he took off and comped me it SHOULDVE been  A LOT CHEAPER. From my calculations, he took off 10$ for the to go and 5$ for the app, that would only be a 16$ bill. I figured ehe really didnt cover the app, which is why it was 23$  I spoke to the GM and he was freakin oblivious, and offered me a 25$ food credit. I was sooo pissed, the waiter basically jipped me for 17$!!! The managers response was that he couldnt do anything about it... so hes letting his employee STEAL MONEY FROM A CUSTOMER? At this point I was soooo mad I wanted to cry, I ended up leaving and telling him to teach his employees basic math. I called the next day to speak to another manager, who was not helpful, and he said the GM I spoke to was higher up and I was welcomed to come and talk to him... OK, I live on the other side of Summerlin?! I'm not driving AGAIN over there to get something fixed that shouldve been fixed LAST NIGHT.   I have not went back for my \"food credit\" I did e-mail bww customer service but they suck horribly and have never e-mailed me back. I really wished the waiter wouldve given me a receipt, but of course he didnt bc he didnt wanna show how he stole money from me.  Freakin jerks! I wish I could give no stars!",

We wait way too long and the wait staff seems very rushed even though I see them standing around talking. its frustrating when I have to wave someone down to get a water refill. my favorite sauces are the original hot and asian zing. I tasted the difference between the honey BBQ and sweet BBQ I definitely prefer the honey BBQ. It has this extra little something to it that I like. If the service was better I would come back but for now I'll be looking for a different location.",

As far as them not being busy, you never know what's really going on unless you're in the kitchen there. Sounds like you went during lunchtime and takeout is usually a nightmare all day. Cut them a break. They're just trying to accommodate all the guests, not just the minority who prefer crispy wings. You have 6 other days to enjoy that modification. Unless they don't serve a quality product or the staff/manager was rude I don't see a reason not to continue to visit this location. They've always been great!",

We were a fairly large party with 10 people and the employees did their best to seat us all together since it was a little packed due to an NBA playoff game. When they seated us, we had an awesome server named Josh. He was super friendly and helped us all throughout the night, taking good care of us. The food always takes a while to come out of here, due to it needing to be fried, tossed, etc, but he let us know and of course we were ok with it. The wings came out fresh and amazing, like always. They had all of the best games going on their TVs and it was all good, no complaints.",

Every time I bit into a slider my taste buds exploded with joy and wonderful taste.  4 stars would be to low for my rating but i think its a 4 1/2, but i chose 5 , Because it was closest to what i really wanted to rate it.                                   -George",

A couple comes right in and the hostess ask how many in the party? At this point I'm upset and addressed the hostess that no one has even helped us. They had the nerve to say sorry and continue to help the couple that came in after us. At this point I tell my son and husband this is not acceptable and I will not give them any of our business. I hope management reads this because this is horrible customer service. We will take our business elsewhere.

    "text": "I don't usually specifically call anyone out unless the situation has grossly fueled my ire...but this review has been a long time a comin'.   Don't get me wrong- I'm not the kind of entitled asshole that walks into an establishment and expects an immediate smile and pat on the ass.  I've bartended and served for many years in this town and I know that it SUCKS.  But Bartender Mike's rudeness, attitude and pace have run unchecked long enough.  My friend and I are regulars. We go in often and play the machines, drink and eat. We know how Mike is, when he works and successfully avoid him for long stretches of time.  Last night, we happened to come in after midnight when he starts work.  True to form, Mike was his usual petulant self; slow and flustered with more than 2 people at the bar; projecting his self-hatred onto the patrons. Unfortunately, with him you just have to roll with it. We figured maybe he wouldn't be so bad this time.  My friend played and lost $20, I played a continuous $40 and cashed out with $80.  Upon receiving our bill, we noticed that not one drink had been comped off. My friend had one vodka cocktail and I had two Angry Orchards. Industry standard is $20 played= 1 comped drink, and even then, that's super uptight.  Rolling my eyes at Mike's usual antics, I questioned it. He proceeded to tell me that since Arby's bought out BWWs, players now have to gamble $300 for one comped drink. No joke he literally came up with $300. Where he got that number? No idea...but I was pissed nonetheless. We were just there a couple weeks ago (different bartender) and had no problems getting our drinks comped. He was obviously pulling bullshit out of nowhere like a goddamn magician, but what could we do? I understand that $40 is pennies compared to what some people play but I figured it was good for at least one free beer. This is an alarmingly typical interaction with this man.  Half of the problem is that there is no one to supervise his tomfoolery on a nightly basis. Left to his own devices, Mike rules his kingdom with a certain Napoleonic air that reeks of ego and mediocrity. Mike giveth and Mike taketh away at his own discretion...and there's nothing we peasants can do about it. I don't have a business degree (don't know nothin' about no marketing strategies) but methinks King Friday and his arbitrary gaming ratios can't be good for business.  Since there is no graveyard manager on duty, I called management in the morning to inquire about their fancy new $300 gaming policy. They had no clue what I was talking about, as expected, and said they'll \"coach\" Mike on current policies. Coach? As if he just didn't know any better. As if $300 is close to reality. As if he's a new employee that needs further training. No, Mike has worked that shift for several years, my dude, you can't coach the douche baggery out of people.  Like we should have done in the first place, my friend and I will be avoiding this location from now on, which is unfortunate because it's close to home and there are many other great bartenders there. And judging from previous reviews, this is not Mike's first 1 star rodeo.   $300. Gtfo.",

The food was frozen, everything was salty and the only thing that had flavor other than salt was the queso dip.  Service was abysmal. We were sitting right next to the waitress station and it took them a while for my wife to get water, and my diet coke sat at the edge of the table for almost 10 minutes, dry.  The male servers were too busy watching the football games on the tvs to provide service, talking about how much they had bet for each game.   Ended up paying $40 for food that has been done better at little league snack bars. If I don't wake up vomiting I'll be surprised.",

My only complaint is while there are ample big screen TVs, they aren't HD so when I try and watch hockey there I can't see the puck.    A place as big and that does as much business as it does should be able to afford the biggest and best quality large screen TVs there are.",

I wont lie when I tell you that it looked worse in here then any chuck e cheese I've ever been too. Every table was trashed. My wife walked into the restroom and said the kitchen looked terrible. And of course the restroom also. I was lucky to have no one greet me or even see me for about 8 min. So my wife and I decided to get up and leave. I dont know who is running this place. But its super terrible. I have gone to many buffalo wild wings and this location doesn't even remotely try a little. As we left I heard 2 waitress blaming each other when they both kept walking past our table. Leaving was probably the best thing I actually did visiting this location.",

Alyssa the girl at the front who handles the Togo's should definitely not be working in customer service. I order wings online and this time decided to get the sauce on the side because they always OVER drench the wings. I ordered a large and when she was going through the order there was only 2 sides of mild. I kindly asked if I could have one more because there was 4 ppl sharing. She gave me some run around then finally said ok. After taking her sweet time, I said thank you and left. As I was walking back to the car I realized she gave us the wrong sauce and it was less than half full. I asked my daughter to go back and ask to exchange it and get the right one. She came back 5 mins later because Alyssa decided she needed to run drinks before getting her mild sauce. My daughter kindly said thank after everything and never got any type of response from her at all. This location is the closest one too me and it's still a little bit aways, but if I do ever decide to eat there again, I'll definitely go out of my way to go to another location. Horrible customer service. If you don't care then feel free to eat there, food is great, customer service is HORRIBLE.",

The host Amber was very kind and funny and ended seating me in the best place possible and I was able to watch the Spurs destroy my ticket lol. Crista was my server and she was absolutely wonderful she made sure the drinks was refilled and that my complicated order was made just right. Really kudos to her where most would have made a mistake she absolutely worked wonders. I also had another sever cailin stop by and make small talk she was funny and sweet as well. Looking around this atmosphere is wonderful there's literally a place for everyone. I gotta start having my game nights here or if I just wanna chill out with my son or kick back with my friends it's something that'll fit my need on the menu. I wanted to pull a manager aside and let them know what a great time I was having and what a great atmosphere they were creating and ended up talking to Peter. He was beyond engaging and I could see why this place ran so smoothly. I honestly feel like I made new connections and friends here and I can't wait to bring my family and friends. Thanks Buffalo Wild Wings for changing my mind and having a great restaurant. for many of you guys that know me know how I feel about industry and being able to connect this place will definitely be a go to and I promise you will leave with new friends and have a blast. And the house sampler is the best thing ever lol",

We were seated towards the back right next to all the kids games.  For some reason parents think its okay to let their kids hang around them even if they aren't really playing them.  Quite rude I must say.  However, that is besides the point.  Brian was our server.  The place was busy but he was all over making sure we were well taken care of.  I love that.  All the food was good from what I saw that everyone ordered.  However the \"rub\" on whoever ordered it was not obvious to taste.  One person had the vinagar salt on their chicken-you couldnt taste it at all, and another had the desert heat and same outcome.  I did have the desert heat on my naked tenders and it was perfect so I must have gotten the right \"rub-chef\". LOL  Other than that...everything ordered minus the \"rub\" issues was great.  On the way out the manager greeted us to make sure all was good and we gave our kudos to Brian the waiter!  I hope that got back to him.  Love great customer service!",

Basically a dark, crowded boring room. That's part of the reason I'm giving it one star, but the main reason is our server. He was friendly and upbeat, however he spilled an ENTIRE Pepsi on me-- It got me head to toe, not joking. It was in my hair, on my face, on my arm, jeans and even in my shoes. It tipped over on his tray and right into me. And as I'm sure anyone knows, when that stuff dries, it's sticky! So the rest of the day wasn't my best.   He felt terrible, apologized profusely and was clearly embarrassed, so I wasn't upset with him- I told him it was an accident. We were all even joking about it to make him comfortable. I'm surprised, however, that when it came time to order my food, he told me if I wanted anything other than french fries with my wrap, there would be an upcharge. REALLY? I'm eating lunch sitting on a towel because you spilled a drink on me and you're going to charge me an upcharge??? When our bill came, he only comped the drinks, which surprised us all. I'm not the type of person to ask for free things, so we just didn't tip him as well as we would have if he did what we felt would be the right thing and give a percent discount or comp my lunch. He was a nice guy so it's just sad that he left that kind of impression on us with how gracious I was about the whole thing.",

    "text": "If I could give this review 0 stars, I would. I love Buffalo Wild Wings, I really do, it has been my go to restaurant EVERY SINGLE TUESDAY for the past 5 years. I always go to the one on the North side of town, but this time, my boyfriend and I decided to go to this one-- bad move. A week prior to today's visit, my boyfriend ordered take out, when he picked it up, they didn't verify the order with him, but he assumed everything was okay, so once he arrived home with it, the order was completely wrong. He had ordered 10 wings, but they gave him 5 and STILL charged him for the \"10\" wings. We got a basket of fries, they gave us a regular sized one and again, charged him for a basket. Not only that, when we picked up the boxes the bottoms of the boxes were WET, I have absolutely no idea what it was, but really...? I called to complain and the girl on the phone said, \"No, impossible, the boxes couldn't have been wet.\" So she assumed I was lying. I asked to speak to a manager, and he gave us $30 food credit. Today's visit was decent up until I brought up the credit to the server. Before she brought us our bill, I said \"excuse me, I believe we have store credit for our food here.\" And responded with a bad attitude saying \"What do you mean store credit?\" And I said \"We have credit here due to our poor visit last time, our food was supposed to be paid for.\" Again, with her horrible attitude she said, \"Yeah, well we don't do that here.\" At this point I was enraged. I laughed and said \"Are you serious?\" She laughed back at me and said \"Yeah, you have to pay for your own food.\" She realized I was angry, and then walked away to talk to her manager. When she came back, she said \"You guys are all taken care of, have a good one\", and I said \"Why did you tell us that we didn't have credit though?\" And she said \"I didn't know that we did that\"- I scoffed and then she did too, rolled her eyes and walked away. I didn't leave a tip or thank her because she didn't deserve it. I still have credit there, but I would rather starve than eat there. Worst experience ever.",

Now, I have been to Bw3 before, so I knew what I was getting myself into: mediocre but cheap food and wings, but a million TVs/cheap drinks. If that tradeoff doesn't seem like what you are looking for you probably want to go elsewhere.   I will say that the TV situation was a little out of control. 90% of the TV's were showing hockey (bleh) or baseball (boring) which I didn't even know were still sports. The sound was also on the hockey play by play which is super interesting except the exact opposite.   The service was good- drink refills were brought in a timely fashion.",

My fries were not only super dry but hard as a rock, in hopes of the tenders being juicy per usual, they were also ridiculously dry. I'm so bummed about this. If it weren't for me being super hungry and having sympathy over Matt serving numerous guests and being alone I would have honestly said something. I'm only here to warn people that if you experience a similar situation, PLEASE say something so you won't have to go home with a sore jaw like myself.   Also just for future reference, take off the expiration sticker on the lids of your ranch before serving them. Not too happy knowing 2 different ranches given were 4 days apart and 1 being almost a week old.. which was quite obvious by the sour taste.",

Staff is quick to greet and friendly. Food comes out in a timely matter and never had an issue. Always get their wings and the mushrooms but unfortunately they discontinued the mushrooms. Never had an issue asking for more celery and carrots along with more ranch and bleu cheese. You can ask for all wings or all drumsticks and also can make them extra crispy. TVs!! Sports is always favored in there, but if you ask, they can usually put on something else that's appropriate. Brian and Raven are the bar tenders tonight. No flaws tonight from me!

They walked us to the far tables right next to the bar. First ding!   The server took around 20 minutes to come by to take our drink order. She didn't even acknowledge us! Second ding!   We usually know exactly what we want and don't usually wait for the drink order to be brought. We order both so they can start cooking our wings. She didn't even wait, but walked away saying she would be right back with drinks and to take our food order. Then in the mean time two more tables where seated on either side of us.   By the time she dropped off the drinks, the first table to the right of us had a different server and she was taking their food order! We still hadn't placed our food order yet. Third ding!  The second table seated now was being asked about their food by our server and she still hadn't taken ours! This was driving us crazy!  Finally she came to take our order. Did offer to give us the onion rings on the happy hour menu to save some money.  The two tables on either side was getting their food!   Our food finally arrived with burnt onion rings! My tea was empty and we needed more napkins. We told her no carrots, just celery and we got three celery sticks and a handful of carrots!   My tea glass sat empty for several passes until she finally brought more. The two tables that sat after us was done and gone. We where waiting for a box and covers for the blue cheese!   The bill finally came but once again, she took her time talking and laughing with other people/tables and servers!  Like I said wings where good, onion rings over cooked, service was bad!",

Ordered 2 draft beers, live that they have a large and small size. Lots of choices on draft.   I had some questions about the wings and the waitress was really friend helpful. I ordered the small, all flats, salt and vinegar, lemon pepper and a side salad. Keeping it keto right now and love that there are so many options here. The bf got a medium of honey bbq, and medium.   The food came out pretty quick and was Delicious! I was not expecting the food to be this tasty. The wings were perfect and salad was so fresh. The bf also loves his and could not finish it. The wings were meaty and very filling.   Can't wait to go back. Enjoyed every second of this meal.",

You see, for many years, this location hosted viewings of UFC PPV events. When I dropped by on Sept 14, this location had no plans to show anything other than televised football games.   I had a snack, and a few happy hour beers. Then I left looking for alternative entertainment.  I notice that BWW management sometimes provides feedback to comments on Yelp. Has this location decided not to have viewing parties going forward?",

We then waited for another 15-20 minutes... still no one so we asked the hostess if she could take our order but she went to tell the server and said he'll be right out.. still no server in sight.

We were here a good 15 minutes before \"the rush.\" We should have gone to BJs or Yard House instead. This place is poorly managed. For a big  chain restaurant you need to get it together!!!!!!

Mostly decent food, 24-hour dining, more TVs than I can count, sports sports sports, and quick service. I go to BWW when I have a hankering for chicken wings (or to watch a game and hang out with friends). But that's pretty much it. Their food is not very spectacular and honestly, without their chicken wings (or those delicious potato wedges), the place would easily be 2-3 stars. So stick to the wings..and potato wedges. Not the fries or chips. Trust me.  My go-to menu items are boneless chicken wings tossed with their dry seasoning, Chipotle BBQ. It's so good. I prefer dry seasoning over sauces, so I was ecstatic when they introduced the seasonings. Along with the chicken, a basket of potato wedges with Cajun seasoning. It's amazing. With their ranch and veggie boat, I'm a happy gal. Sometimes we will order one of the appetizers, but nothing is phenomenal. On my last visit, I tried their new Garden Crasher. A platter of various raw vegetables (carrots, celery, bell pepper, cucumber) with hummus and yogurt. The hummus was not very good, but to get a platter full of fresh vegetables in a bar restaurant? I was very happy.",

The waiter actually kept checking on us, which is unusual at this location from the last few times we came. You could never go wrong with the traditional wings, I what makes it better is that now they have lunch break specials. I didn't understand what the lunch break special was, but now that I know what it is after our visit, you get your food for free if it takes them 15 minutes to get your food. So next time, you know for sure we're going during lunch and we're gonna use that timer to see if we can get free food.  We got the hot and mild buffalo wings, Southwest onion rings were always good, and of course the little tablets for the kids to play on, It kept them occupied while we waited. Will definitely come back, always looking toward to our next visit.",

So tonight I had ordered another 10 Traditional Buffalo Dry Rub, 6 Traditional Asian Zing, 6 Traditional Spicy Garlic, and a ranch. When I got home, I found another bird feather in my food. I called the store and the cashier directed me to a female manager by the name of Kristina. This lady was so rude to me and was trying to convince me that having feathers in the chicken is normal for Buffalo Wild Wings. I HAVE NEVER HAD FEATHERS IN MY FOOD OTHER THEN WHEN I ATE AT BUFFALO WILD WINGS. I questioned her about the quality control over food before serving it to the customers and she cut me off by saying that they go through several processes before serving anything to their customers. If that is so, then why has there been feathers in my food the last two times I had eaten at Buffalo Wild Wing? I've been going to Buffalo Wild Wings since I was a kid and now I will never eat here again.   Disgusting...",

Being a guinea, garlic is my weakness. The only thing that lures me in even more is adding parmesan cheese to it. It reminds me a lot of the Italian Style wings we use to make at our old pizza place. They also have a great Mango Habanero that I enjoy, great for fans of spicier sauces. It's sweet and very spicy as the name implies.They have awesome buffalo chips when they decide to actually fully cook them. Often times they are slightly undercooked and that makes them just kinda Meh. I do take out from here more often, but occasionally eat in the bar area.   The staff is always friendly and they get bonus points for being so helpful with putting Rob's tournament on the big screens with audio and everything. What else is pretty awesome is they have $3 Jack Daniel's, Domestic Drafts and something else after 10. Along with $3 appetizers. They also have specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays. If I remember correct they are special priced regular wings on Tuesdays and boneless wings on Thursdays.   Sometimes I do prefer Wing Stop but I'm not passionate one way or the other. It kinda depends on what area I'm at. Also WIng Stop is way more of a takeout place, where Buffalo Wild Wings is the kinda place you can chill with friends and catch a game.  Also completely unrelated to the review, I really dislike calling this place B Dubs. I know the name Buffalo Wild Wings isn't short or catchy but that nickname is a pet peeve of mine. Maybe because of hearing people call George W Bush, G dub. I don't wanna think of that guy when I'm thinking about where to get my eat on. Sorry, rant over.",

So, that's why whenever the Blackhawks are playing, or the Cubs are getting ready to lose I'm here.  There's tons of high screen TV's that are always on sports, a bunch of beers on tap, and great wings.  The service is always pretty good, but when it gets a little busy you'll get a bartender asking if you want another drink right after you ordered one from the last guy.  Let's be honest, though...that's better than the alternative where you sit for 10 minutes before the bartender even sees you need another drink, then asks 3 minutes later if you want it (I'm looking at you Kona Grill).  So.  It's got pretty good bar food, even if you don't like chicken wings, and fairly okay priced drinks ($3-$6, 8-9 for the fancy lady drinks with fruit and flavored vodka, etc).  -1 because only one game can be on sound at a time, and it generally winds up being the game the biggest idiot in the bar wants to watch.  Also, because they ditched the Chicken Caesar Salad and most of the other \"healthy sounding\" food items my girlfriend liked.  That's it.",

I've tried the potato wedges, burgers, wraps, and salads, and all are average at best.  Don't waste the stomach space.  There are many sauces to choose from, my favorite being the spicy Mango Habanero sauce.    Here's what you do:    Call in an order of about 20 boneless wings just for yourself on a football Sunday.  Make sure nobody is home of course, this is going to be a shamefeast.  When you return with your saucy bounty, close the curtains, lock the doors, and get carnivorous.  Nobody likes a quitter, so just like a marathon runner you'll have to push through.  Yep, I just compared running a marathon to stuffing your face with boneless wings.  SHAZAM!",

    "text": "We order take out every Tuesday for their 60 cent wing special. We've visited this location at least a dozen times and have never had an error on a take out order and the wings are always cooked properly and seasoned well. We are working our way through the flavors. I highly recommend any of the dry rubs (distinguishable by the use of \"seasoning\" in the flavor name). The sweet bbq and honey bbq flavors are our 5 year old's preferred flavor. I'm a big fan of traditional wings and my husband and kid prefer boneless. The boneless wings are all reasonably sized/shaped and you definitely feel as though you've received the same amount of meat. Also, you may receive a survey on your receipt with a $5 off coupon, which if you're a weekly visitor will be surely used within the 14 day expiration period.",

At 2am, I walked up, doors locked, a spot light on a lone switch, pressed it...3 seconds...LOUD SCREAM!!!...i jump like a douche, bartender runs out the other door, apologizes, gives me a shot of Jameson's as consolation.  Upon ordering, he turns on a surveillance tv pointed towards that same spot I pressed the enter button...PURE ENTERTAINMENT for a solid hour.  This place gets my seal of AWESOME!!",

    "text": "Another family affair, wings were the order of the night. I usually frequent the Durango or LV Outlet locations. My first visit to a B-Dubs that wasn't one of the two aforementioned, but this was the closest in proximity. I almost felt like I was cheating on my regular wing spots. Entering at first, I thought this particular location was very small. But it was deceptive. The place turned out to be bigger. There is alot of walls separating the various sections of the place. I'm glad to say the food and service was good. Eating with my family, there's usually a few quirks in our ordering. Everything went smoothly. Checked upon often and drinks refilled. It is worth noting they brought back their unlimited wings & fries weekday lunch special for $12.99 for a limited time(Was $11.99 when they last had it year). Their Wing Tuesdays & Boneless Thursdays are now both $0.60/wing. Boneless used to be $0.60 and on Tuesday traditional bone-in $0.45 but they raised the bone-in to match the boneless price. Inflation must be hitting this place pretty hard. Wing Tuesday has gone up from $0.25 to $0.60 since I've lived here in 2006. Even with the rising prices, I will probably still be a regular long as the service stays good. There's no accounting for good service, ever.",

The servers stand around chatting with each other instead of refilling drinks, fulfilling orders, and asking if we need anything. Ugh... if the food was not as good as it is, I would not be coming back.  Luckily, the food more than makes up for the crappy service. My boyfriend always gets wings, and I get tenders, and we share them. Their tenders are very crispy and juicy on the inside. They come in orders of 4 or 6 and they also come with your choice of sauce, fries, and ranch dressing, just how I like them. I usually get them with the honey bbq sauce, as the wings are usually coated in a spicier sauce.  Parmesan garlic is my favorite sauce by far for the wings; it tastes very Italian. Spicy garlic is my least favorite; it's too spicy and doesn't have any specific flavor otherwise. I've also tried asian xing (which is really good), Caribbean jerk (which made my nose runny from the heat), hot bbq (good), and mango habanero (delicious! but it made my eyes water",

Lets just say that his tables are all that matters and if his coworkers are behind, he'll let them sink. So for those who want to consider applying here, or eating here, please, reconsider.

Yes once we arriving we were told that we had to play the slots if we wanted to stay at the bar. We each put 5 dollars in the machine and ordered all our food and drinks. My group and myself go and watch sports there all the time last night we saw the golden knights vs jets game 3 along with everybody else around the bar. At the end when we asked for are bill the bartender Doug was very rude. He told us we laughed at the other bartender when she told us we had to play the slots which is a total lie and said my group wasnt welcome to sit in the bar area anymore during busy events. At the shock we just got up and left after the game. Mind you that nobody else was told they had to play to stay. One bad experience changes everything and Doug will get his wish as we will not return to that establishment. It use to be my favorite place for wings and sports and always had a good time with my buddies but looks like we have to go to a new place from now on.",

The food was lacking the deliciousness we remember  The sauce was used very sparingly with our chicken, our potato wedges were NOT cooked long enough (we had to return it). When we decided to just get to go boxes and leave, we found out that they changed their Tuesday deal from Traditional to Boneless, they didn't even say anything to us. We also learned they changed the prices, so you pay MORE for LESS. Not even worth it.   As a mother, the most annoying part is how small their high chair is. My daughter is very small and could barely bend her legs to get in    Won't be visiting again in awhile, if not ever.  They need to work on their staff and their attentiveness.

Our server, Michael, was extremely rude the entire time and I've never felt so disrespected as a customer.  I dined there last night after a few drinks at PKWY. We sat in the bar area and the bartender/server had very little patience for us while ordering (even tho the bar was fairly empty). After I ordered, I just asked if he can make sure we have carrots and celery, and I always ask Bc servers have forgotten about them before and he very rudely said yeah, they always come with it. So the food comes out, and he checks on us once. As we were finishing up, we asked for boxes, which took him a while to get bc he was on his phone before giving us the boxes!! then he constantly kept checking on our checks to see if they were ready. we had 2/4 payments out and the other two were getting their cards out and he didn't have the patience to wait just a few seconds. And I KNOW they do military discount but he couldn't give us it bc there was \"no manager present\", which sure that may be True, but it makes no sense to not honor it.. what if he had a void, cuz I know those need a manager for that?? And even if that was the case, he was very rude about it and we had 3 members in the group in the military..  I understand most people don't like to deal with \"drunk\" people but we werent even drunk or rude. Just a few young adults tryna get some chicken wings. So if you're in the area coming past 11, I would skip the place entirely if you don't want an asshole aka Michael taking care of ya!  My chicken wings were bomb tho btw.",

Such a let down. The chicken was so bland and worst of all when I went to get the napkins out of my bag they were bunched together and obviously were used . Like wtf???? So disgusting... I really wish I didn't tip . Complete Waste of money , I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone . Don't even bother especially after midnight.",

Unfortunately, our credit card charges an additional $8 bank fee which Julie did not want to reimburse.   We politely asked if she could reimburse us for both fees since we were eager to pay but did not want to be charged unnecessary fees because of the broken machine.   She got ignorant with us and made it sound like we were a pair of degenerates and offered to 86 us from the location & call the police for not wanting to pay....  We DID want to pay but we wanted to avoid excess transaction costs!!  She went and disappeared in the back for 15 minutes, and showed no signs of coming back out.  The bartender apologized to us and said we could leave.   We left and never saw Julie again.   Yes we're going to complain to corporate. She was highly unprofessional and rude.",

Not only do they play all of the games with the sound, but they have a great happy hour as well ($3.75 for a tall Bud Light) as well as food specials. It's really nice to be able to invite guests with children to watch the games in a lively setting with TV's everywhere.  Most restaurants do not have all Of the games on in the dining room, usually only the bar area, which is off limits to kids.  The service at this location is good, especially for how busy it gets, and the food is what is to be expected from a wing and beer spot.  This location is also a short drive from Summerlin, which makes it a convenient stop for those living in this area.",

A few minutes later he came back and paid it.  Big ups to Mike for not losing is cool and letting the situation get out of hand!!

My friends Amelinda L. clued me into their boneless wings Thursday special and I decided to do take out last night.  Boneless wings are $.60 each on Thursdays.  It's only about 3 miles, so it's not a drive for me to go here.  I din't order online or phone my order in.  When I got there, the young woman at the register walked me through the process and answered my questions.  A minimum of 4 wings per flavor must be ordered.  I ended up getting 6 spicy garlic for my wife and 6 of the classic hot for myself.  I also ordered a basket of fries which she assured me was great for two people sharing.  She was correct!  The cashier told me it would be 10 to 15 minutes.  I started to play Angry Birds and before I could swear twice, the order was ready.  It was probably 5 minutes maximum.  I brought the order home and we dug in.  I was so hungry that I forgot to take a photo of the food.  Next time.  The wings were very good and the sauces were just right.  There was a nice bite to my lips from the hot sauce.  The fries ameliorated that heat a bit and I had a nice mug of iced tea at hand.  I am a fan and I think I'll come back here on a Thursday again.  For less than $14, dinner for 2.  Not bad at all.  And tasty dinner for two.  And, I didn't have to cook!  Amelinda L, thanks once again!",

My husband was game, so we headed to the BWW on Hualapai. Recently a wings place, which shall remain nameless, STOPPED selling traditional side dishes we liked. They STOPPED and so we STOPPED taking out their food, though their WINGS are fine, but STOP messing with our sides. I mean, seriously: STOP! We were seated immediately at BWW. The parking lot was full and the place was hopping! Families, kids, and seniors like us.  Server was johnny on the spot at our table, knowledgeable and friendly. Savannah had our drinks (a tall, very good Hefeweisen and a pretty good IPA from Washington state) and some roasted mushrooms, which turned out to be fried. I recommend that the pieces of mushroom actually contain more mushroom than just batter pieces without mushroom, but they worked enough in there that you could at least get 7 real mushrooms in the entree for almost $7. my husband had a spicy sauce with bone in wings and I went for the Thai ginger which is amazing on my grilled chicken. Give me an attentive server PLUS a manager who checks in naturally and with a welcoming manner. Thank you, Aaron! Staff were numerous and the crowd seems satisfied.  This was a very good experience.",

    "text": "I've lived in this part of town my entire life and recently moved closer to this BWW. There are soooo many bars and restaurants in this 2 mile radius Soni had never been there before but my friends come here all the time and invite us over, well today I finally made the trip over and I will never come back here ever again. I met my friends up at the bar section and right as I got there I was carded by Kelly. She was alright, didn't have the most pleasant look on her face, she looked a bit stressed, a bit annoyed, but was still polite in her tone. She took my drink and food order and that was the extent of me dealing with her. Later I wanted another beer but she was not coming around so I ended up asking the next employee passing by if I could order from her. She said \"sure\" and I saw her go up to a tall skinny tattooed guy at the bar and say a few things and point at my group and then he looked at us and went to the register, got the drink, and came back and handed us the drink. Most of my stay there was meh (i wasn't offered water and my friends weren't offered water refills until someone asked which is unusual as typically servers are on top of refilling water) It wasn't until the game that we were watching was over and all my friends had closed out our tabs and tipped that this tall skinny tattooed guy named DOUG approached my friends and started yelling at them, literally raised his voice so loud  that the whole bar was staring and started yelling at them about how they were not allowed to sit there (at the bar) because of the machines and because they only played $15?! He literally said \"You guys are not allowed to sit here ever! You were told when you got here and you didn't play! This is how we make our money! And I can't tell you were to sit but you are not to sit here ever again for any games or ever\" AS IF THE $20+ THAT EACH OF US SPENT IN ONLY 1 HOUR, not including the generous tip considering their less than mediocre service,  DIDN'T COUNT FOR SHIT! He pretty much said he didn't care for our business even though my 3 other friends are  REGULARS (they are there every week!!!) Then he directed his yelling at me and my boyfriend and i who were not even sitting at a machine and who got there way after and whom he only interacted with when they got us 1 measly drink! And I will be totally honest, most bars, unless they are super busy, don't care if you sit at the bar and you're not gambling. If they do get busy and they have players that want to play, they will politely ask you to scoot over or will get a table for you to move to, NONE of the people working this bar did that or even mention it AND ALSO most of the people sitting along the bar were not playing either! I know this for a fact because I had made sure to observe it because I've been POLITELY asked to scoot to another seat before at bars like this but after looking at every one else, I thought we would be fine as there were  obviously many people  sitting at games who  were  not playing either! Including one couple that I observed just chit chatting the whole time who  got up, stepped outside through a side exit for 15 minutes, then came back to their seats in front of machines that were still wide open and available and we're not take. By ANYONE looking to gamble. And either way we were STILL paying customers fair and square! The whole way this asshole, Doug, approached us was incredibly unprofessional and rude. Shitty customer service and customer interaction. And you know what's funniest?! Prior to this review, there have been others who've complained about him too! Good going Doug, you just lost this already miserable location 3 regular customers and 2 new ones who will never set foot in this place again or ever even recommend it.",

Upon arriving we were told we had to play the slots if we wanted to stay at the bar. We each put 5 dollars in the machine and ordered all our food. We stayed the duration of the knights vs jets game along with everybody else around the bar. At the end the bartender doug was very rude. He told us that because he makes all his money on the slots and we played only 5 dollars we were not welcomed there anymore during the games and busy times. He also said that we laughed at the other bartender when she told us we had to play the slots which is a total lie. Mind you that nobody else was told they had to play to stay. Like I said, we've been coming here for 2 years to the point that they don't even check our ID at the bar because they know us. Regardless one bad experience changes everything and doug will get his wish as we will not be coming here anymore or any other location either.",

This location is a little worse than the location off Las Vegas Blvd. they don't have the same IPA selection and don't make the fried pickles the same either, and that's about all I enjoy. Service is normal, crowd is about the same. My top would be stick to beer, fries, and regular wings if you MUST come here to eat.",

After asking another employee we were immediately serviced. The food was mediocre so would rather order from another local joint were people are happy and have better food and customer service.",

Forget about everything else, this place has a strict no smoking policy and that makes me a very happy person.   I stopped in here Tuesday night around 7ish and b-dubs was packed. The happy hour crowd was just starting to filter out so I was able to get a seat at the bar. The stools at the bar are so much better if you can snag one. The stools around the tables don't have backs and they suck. If you're going to be here for any amount of time get a barstool that you can at least lean back in.   Tuesday is 45 cent wing day so I ordered lots of  chicken wings in different sauces. My favorites are mango habanero which is my \"go-to\" and jammin jalapeno which I had never tasted before but loved. The wings here are very small so I usually order a few more than I normally would at other wing joints. The service is pretty average, about what you would expect from any popular chain. I like the smokeless atmosphere and lots of little wings in different sauces, so for that, I'll go back.",

    "text": "I'm usually a Wingstop fan but when I had a wing craving on a budget, I suggested Buffalo Wild Wings to my husband because their wings are $0.45 on Tuesdays. I haven't eaten here in 4 years because the last couple of times were gross, but I decided to give it another try and after tonight, never again Buffalo Wild Wings.   We ordered 15 spicy garlic and 15 Asian zing traditional bone-in wings, large fries, veggie sticks, and 3 ranches. The quality of the wings seemed lesser than those of Wingstop; they were small, tough, and over cooked. The spicy garlic sauce was a typical hot sauce with a bit of garlic flavor and the Asian zing was sweet and boring topped with red chili flakes. Although neither of which were actually spicy like their names implied, I definitely prefer the \"spicy\" garlic.   The large fries looked like a medium from McDonald's. When we order a large fry from Wingstop, I've had 4 adults and two children work on it but never managed to finish it whereas my husband and I alone were able to kill these fries. The veggies had really stringy, strangely bright green celery, and baby carrots. The tiny ranches, which cost 60 cents each, tasted like they came from a bottle of Hidden Valley.   When I pulled up to pick up my food at 8:30 PM, the place was packed with people parking in the adjacent desert. The girls in the front tilted my box of Asian zing on the side so all of the sauce spilled over the boxes and the bag. Since I haven't eaten here in so long, I thought that the box was holding something which should be stood vertically, but if I worked here and saw to-go bags going out constantly, I would have noticed it and fixed it. So I guess some people like to come here for the scene and the game, but if you're looking for a good wing meal to-go, this is definitely not the place to get it from.",
