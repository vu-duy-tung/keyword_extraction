    "text": "Having grown up in LA and being a HUGE fan of mexican food I'm always skeptical about eating \"posh\" mexican food.  Before we get started with the review, DO NOT go to this place if you are expecting \"typical gringo mexican food\".  What I mean by that is if you want oil soaked enchiladas with a heaping spoonful of refried beans with 3 lbs. of cheese covering a scorching hot plate and chile rellenos, crunchy tacos, and the 3 item combo from a place like Chevy's, El Torito, or Macayos, then move along.  Otherwise, keep reading.  I ordered the carnitas street tacos.  The carnitas were tender inside and slightly crunchy on the outside which is a result of the braising process but also the pork slightly frying in its own fat.  They weren't greasy though, and came dressed with salsa, onions, and cilantro (hence, street tacos, like the ones you get in street taco shops).  But the flavors were outstanding.  No shredded cheese or heaps of lettuce either, which added to the authenticity of this food.  These were served with black beans and rice on the side which was nothing special, but really I didn't need anything overly overstated.  Yes, paying around $12 for 3 tacos is exorbitant, especially when you pay $0.50 to $1.00 per taco in Mexico.  But come on people, it's Vegas.  If you want cheap there is a La Salsa around the corner.  And when you take a street taco and refine it to up the gourmet quality, it really was worth it.  They serve the obligatory chips and salsa, and I would best describe the salsa as being a more coarse molcajete style salsa.   My friend ordered the steak nachos, which were unconventional but delicious.  They were individual flour tortilla chips with a slice of grilled steak, cheese, and beans with a jalapeno slice on each chip.  Those were delicious as well.     All in all, I would highly recommend the food, but have an open mind, especially if you are expecting the same ol' american style mexican food.  Certainly hole-in-the-wall taquerias have their merits and strengths (some al pastor anyone?!) but this place provides a more upscale spin for a tasty lunch.",

    "text": "Food was generally acceptable, but... Service was slow and snarky. The soda machine was broken so you could only have tap water or a $10 Margarita. WTF? You have to pay for chips. The salsa spread was unique, but one of the salsas looked like earwax. Mango puree? Still, it beats waiting in line for the buffet. Hint: If you need to sit on the floor to rest while you're waiting in line for a buffet, you shouldn't be waiting in line for a buffet. Try Yolos!",

They're trying to do fancy Mexican, and the plating is fancy.  The quality however, is just OK.  They do have a decent tequila selection however, and their margaritas are pretty good for the price.  Not a bad place to grab a drink and watch some sports, but you could eat elsewhere and feel better about your dining IMO.",

Only four but that's to be expected. The Drunken chicken nachos were HOT. I like hot but this was lips on fire hot and there's nothing telling you that when you order so my sis couldn't eat them. The chicken was kind of soupy so it made the chips mushy which I don't like. Also, the chips were bottom of the bag, small pieces. I've never had that even in the cheapest dives. Makes me suspect that all those fancy tequilas they're offering are probably one cheap, bottom of the barrel brand.",

From the hostess to the bartender everyone was on top of their game! I had the chicken tacos and they were delicious! We also ordered gaucamole which had just the right about of heat to it! My friends had the steak nachos which is done a little different than most people and they loved them!! Also we all drank margarita's and they were some of the best ones I have had in a long time. Nadjana was the bartender and she was so nice and friendly! She attended to all our needs! I will definitely come back because I always have friends in town that stay on the strip!!! They also told us that they had just remodeled and the place looked great!!",

Located at the corner of the casino at Planet Hollywood, Yolos' pink and green lights lure you in to their sleek but simple restaurant. They are a sit down restaurant as well as a bar so feel free to grab dinner there or take a couple of shots before entering Planet Hollywood's nightclub, Prive just a few steps away.  I always order their steak quesadillas that come with an ample amount of sour cream, guacamole, and salsa. While waiting, you are given a basket of crisp chips and their house salsa that is just the right amount of spicy.  They're never super super busy so good attention is always given by the servers. For 2 people, a check could roughly come out to $36-$40 (including tip). Not too shabby for Vegas!",

Decent price, good food, kinda reminds me of Pink Tacos (for all you LA ppl) It's located inside of Planet Hollywood  Came here to get a \"snack\" which turned into a full on meal. The fajitas are pretty good. There's about 6 thin strips and they give you all the goods to put into your fajita: sour cream, guac, beans, rice, etc.   The guacamole fresca is pretty damn good. They make it in front of you and it's just basically guac and chips.   I don't know, I thought this place was pretty good but I was also starving so at that point, I think anything is really good.

I saw some people mentioned happy hours and we missed that, I'm speaking in terms of the general dinner. We paid something like $150-200 for 4 people to eat and get drinks.  Being from Texas, my mark for Mexican food is high. We ate at Cabo Wabo too, it was a little better and a little cheaper. The food here was very plain. The chicken was just a simple white meat in rectangular strips and the tortillas were standard, not homemade. There are also no free chips and salsa (which blows my mind at a Mexican food place).  The big knock is that the queso is barely a step above the jarred stuff in the stores. There is an oil based, cream quality to it. It's just plainly subpar.   The place was clean, our server was nice and everything like that went well. But the food to price ratio (however you want to put that) was just way off.",

    "text": "Finding a decent meal that doesn't cost you an arm & a leg is a difficult thing to do in Las Vegas.  You can also get very tired, very quickly of the long lines at the hedonistic buffets.  Additionally every hotel has soo many restaurants you can easily get lost in the websites and hotel brochures.  Sometimes you just need to explore the mystical Vegas landscape and hunt yourself down some grub. So that's what we did.  After a long day of wandering The Las Vegas Strip in the sun, we had worked up quite a hunger.  Originally we had stopped in at Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino to grab a beverage and to rest our feet for a minute in front of a negative ATM (a slot machine, it's a joke, cause you put money into it.  Get it? You got it.) when we say the giant bright neon sign for YOLO'S Mexican Grill.    It appears quaint, yet still very active.  Like a small 10 person house party that gets really out of control.  We checked out the menu, and decided to roll the dice.  It wasn't too busy inside, maybe 60% capacity, but it was enough that it didn't feel lonely inside.  We were sat near the edge, so we could \"people watch\" the hordes of people stroll by.  The decor is quite modern, except splattered with neon.  Think of the design style inside Aria, but then have street artists come with buckets of precise neon and accent the whole thing.  Strangely, it works; not like neon did in the 90's  We began the Yolo's experience with a Margarona; a margarita with a Coronita inserted upside down.  We saw everyone around us drinking it, and said, \"That looks fun, let's try it!\"  I'm not a big margarita person, but it wasn't bad. Wasn't spectacular, but the spectacle of it cranked the \"fun-ness\" level which somehow made it tastier.  We ordered the Chips & Sales ($3) to start of the meal, both to curb the alcohol and the hunger gained by walking around The Strip for hours.  What came was a mountain of corn chips and a heaping bowl of salsa, almost too much for an appetizer.  Immediately after we indulged the Roasted Vegetable Fajitas ($13) and the Adobo Vegetable Enchiladas ($12).  We immediately realized how naive we were in ordering an appetizer as the portion sizes of the two mains were enormous.  Like everywhere on the planet that served Mexican food, I had to ask for more tortillas twice (12) and because there was simply SOOO much food to stuff into my gullet.  The vegetables were spiced nicely, not overly salty (as a common Mexican trend) and thankfully there was enough sour cream, salsa, guacamole and cheese (most importantly) to garnish my riotous portion of tortillas.  We tried both the Mexican rice, and the cilantro rice; the cilantro being my favorite.  It was enough of a palette cleanser to separate the barrage of Mexican flavours.  The black pinto beans were superb, and both made sure we finished the portions.  By then end, we actually had to force ourselves to stop eating.  We were so full we felt like the blueberry girl from Charlie & The Chocolate factory.  We sat to regain the blood flow to our legs and enjoyed a Bohemia draft, and a Carta Blanca - both imported Mexican brews.  Best of all was the bill, it was easily the least expensive meal we had had in Vegas thus far; yet one of the most satisfying.  Partially due to our significant over indulgence.  We did end up visiting the negative ATM's immediately after, as the gargantuan \"fullness\" needed a solid 90 minutes before we felt like normal human beings again.",

These were soft and made of flour. Chicken had food flavor.  STREET TACOS - these were also in a flour tortilla. Again chicken had good flavor and it's hard to mess up a small street taco. Fish street tacos also had good flavor RICE and BEANS - absolutely no flavor at all.",

    "text": "I'm weary of eating on the Strip because of two things - the prices, especially because everything has an 18% \"entertainment tax\" tacked on, either in the price of the food, or at the end of the meal, and because service is either non-existent or good. There is no in between.   When my sister was complaining about being hungry when we had time to kill before we saw a 9 o'clock show last night (7/25/11,) I was dreading how much I was going to have to throw down to pay for the meal. Walking around Planet Hollywood, I noticed there isn't much in the way of food.  My sister wanted pizza, but we couldn't find any. Next choice (always the best) was Mexican food.   We walked right up to the bar and sat down. Got ID'd, were handed menus and given waters. WOW, $5 for chips and salsas. I look over at the people sitting on either side of us. They have chips and salsa and there's no way I'm paying that much for what I see. My sister and I settle on splitting the $10 \"drunken\" chicken nachos. My sister remarks that the margaritas come out of a slushi machine. \"Ew, that means fake lime flavor. Pass\" she says, with a scrunched up nose. I look at the drink menu. The mojitos sound good. $10? Eh, never mind. I'm not that interested in paying that for a drink. I'm a local, after all.   I look at the register in front of me. \"$138?!\" Our neighbor's tab for two is astronomical! Our other neighbor gets rung up. \"$124!!\" Good thing we only ordered an appetizer or else I might be in the poor house. These dinner portions are TEENSY!   My sister worries aloud that we might not have time to finish our meal when it comes out. A few minutes later a small mound of nachos comes out in a molcajete. My sister says \"never mind\" about not finishing the nachos. The portion is so tiny, one person could easily finish them. Good thing I'm not very hungry so it was enough for two. My sister laughs when she says we finished them in less than 10 minutes.   The taste was decent. Not the best ever nachos I've had, especially because some chips were full on black at the bottom of the pile - they probably got forgotten about under the broiler. The bottom was soggy as there was a big puddle of whatever the watery \"drunken\" sauce was.  The service was attentive, which is a big thing in Vegas. The interior is also fun and pretty. Even though my sister is nowhere near full and I feel what we bought was worth maybe $5, I don't feel terribly ripped off. Would I make a special trip to eat here? No, but it was good for what it was - a \"low priced\" snack on the Strip.",

When it came it had salt- not the end of the world...but it was by far the worst margarita I've ever tasted. Barf. When I told the bartender that I wasn't pleased. Well apparently neither was she. She took it back and never brought me the beer I requested in it's place. 10 minutes later a guy asked me if I needed a drink and it finally arrived.

We were drawn to this place because of ample seating, DJ, and the hookah. I know, I know what a combo right Mexican restaurant with Hookah. But whateves its Vegas I guess everything goes huh.   Atmosphere was chill and kick back, just the way I like it. I only wish we would have tried this place earlier in the week. Mixed drinks we're typical Vegas watered down and overpriced. But we had lots of fun here. People watching, was entertaining lets just keep it at that. LOL  We'll have to come back and try the food on my next visit.",

    "text": "I came across this restaurant in a travel guide (yes, my family still buys them occasionally) about a year ago.  I was looking for Mexican food and initially chose Los Dos Caminos over it because they offered free chips and salsa (silly, but important...who wants to pay for just chips and salsa?!?) Now Dos Caminos is closed (so sad) so we decided to give Yolos a try.  The chips are now free (unless they always were and I was thinking of a different restaurant).  The tacos are delicious as is the cilantro rice.  I have never had rice like that before and it was amazing!  The margaritas were also delicious.    I'm surprised at the complaints about the price.  Our meal at Yolos was cheaper than any other meals we had on our trip.  I felt that the price was comparable to my favorite Mexican restaurant in Chicago.    We ate early, so the restaurant was almost empty.  The atmosphere is cool, dark booths illuminated by the drink menu.  Our service was excellent.  I will definitely come back on my next trip.",

Turns out Yolos was a good choice.  There was no wait, plenty of tables, nice atmosphere despite practically being in the casino and fast service.  The Tortilla soup was great. The mahi tacos were ok and the chicken fajitas were decent. I'd give the food three stars. The service was phenomenal and courteous; and very timely. Our food came hot and fresh, and a bit faster than we were ready.  It's not a bad place to try out. It isn't cheap, but not many places in Vegas are. It's not that expensive either.",

Don't bother ordering the wine as I believe it was wine from a box quality. The Margaritas were decent (for $4) and it is available only at the bar.  The carnitas flautas were suprising delicious. It's lighty fried with a green avocodo sauce on top. The tacos and tequitos were just OK.   We've ordered 8 things all together and the bill was only $32.

On my most recent visit, we opted to sit at the bar and have some drinks and appetizers. The bartender was friendly and attentive. The margaritas were the best part of our experience. They were large and really well-made. You choose which type of tequila you want, how you want (rocks, blended, etc.) and if you want any added flavors. It's a pretty cool way to have a margarita menu. The queso I had was pretty tasty and it was served with fresh tortillas. The salsas were pretty good too. Though, chips and salsa is not complimentary, you have to pay for it. All in all, it's an a-ok spot. I wouldn't make a special trip to PH just to eat here. But I would eat here again if I was at PH and hungry.",

It was the perfect amount for three women. The food was definitely good, but it was pretty standard Mexican food. Nothing super special or out of the ordinary, just a standard Mexican place.   One bummer was that they didn't offer any sort of birthday celebration or free dessert. We were celebrating a birthday, and I was really shocked that they didn't offer a complimentary dessert or something. They also didn't offer complimentary chips and salsa. I know it's Vegas and everything is more expensive, but I was surprised that chips and salsa weren't included.   I gave the restaurant 4 stars. The service was good, the food was good, but honestly, I don't think I would go back. It was a standard Mexican restaurant. I enjoyed it for what it was, and have nothing too bad to say about it, though.",

Good place to check out whenever you're in Vegas...",

We decided to have some appetizers- chip, guacamole, salsa and a shrimp dish. The food was excellent and I wish that we had decided to have a full meal here.  In the end it was a little pricey- three drinks and the appetizers came to around eighty dollars. However, we enjoyed everything and our bartender was very nice and personable. She even took care of fixing a mistake from the kitchen, walking back there and getting our order done right.   I would definitely go back here.",

The decor was really pretty and I did like the vibe, but it was kind of empty so that should have told us something. I ordered shredded beef enchiladas and my cousin ordered the carne asada tacos. They both cost about $15 each and came with black beans and cilantro rice.   When the food came the rice was cold on both our plates and the food was not well seasoned. The shredded beef tasted like pot roast and the black beans tasted like they came out a can.   The only good thing that I can say about the place was that when I told the manager the food was not good, after I took two bites, she agreed and we immediately left without having to pay.",

The karaoke DJ lost my friend's slip, went on some extended break where he just stood there, maybe checking his email or bidding on an eBay auction. I did sing a song and when I asked the KJ where to get my drink, he handed me a slip and told me to take it to the bar. When I did, the bartender gave me... a cheap, plastic EMPTY cup with the Yolos logo. When I asked him what he was going to fill it with, he laughed. And the I said, \"no, seriously. Where's the shot?\" and again, no laughs. I can afford to buy my own drinks but don't advertise something you're not going to deliver. Shady and cheap.",

However my steak took soooo much longer to get to me and by the time i started to take a bite of mine the rest of my party was done, and as you can imagine was very annoying. However, it was made up by the manager providing our party an array of desserts on the house. This made me get over it quick, as it was not only free but very tasty as well.

Originally I wanted to come for the lunch special but I ended up coming after that time slot so we ate off the regular menu. When we went the restaurant was pretty empty but we still had to wait 10 minutes for a table (odd). We were seated and our waitress was nice.  I got the chicken street tacos with rice and black beans. I liked my food but I couldn't eat it all because I was getting full. The price was reasonable at $12. I got the Razzarita drink, which is a blended drink of raspberry schnapps, vodka, etc. which was  very good and just my style, fruity adn blended. My sister got the steak nachos which were somewhat small. Her only complaint was that the steak tasted weird but overall the nachos were good.  The total for the bill for 2 people plus one alcoholic drink was, I believe $38 which is a very good price for a late lunch/early early dinner meal on the strip. I would go back.",

The chips and salsa they leave on the table are delicious. I love the baked chips and the salsa is the perfect blend of spicy but not too spicy.  Once I had a chance to look at there really cool electronic drink menu I decided on a frozen strawberry Margarita. The drink was super delicious! It was pretty awesome that you could create your own Margarita though. One side of there drink menu was the create your own Margarita and the other was a list of cocktails they offered.   I decided on the Pork Carnitas street tacos for dinner. They came with a side of black beans and a choice of rice either Mexican or cilantro.  The meal was three small tacos with guacamole and salsa on the side of the plate. The tacos were just ok in my opinion. Personally nothing spectacular but not horrible either. I thought they were kinda of dry and needed just a little more sauce to make them better. I just used extra salsa to enjoy them a little more then I would have normally.   Now price wise this is pretty expensive for Mexican but it is on the strip so that is what you get. People should not be surprised at how expensive it can be. On top of being a pretty expensive meal for one person because I was with a party of 8 or more thy added gratuity. Gratuity ended up being $6 for everyone which I thought was decent for Vegas pricing.   The thing I really enjoyed was the decor and ambiance of Yolos. I loved the colors and lighting. Also we had excellent service from a very attentive waiter who was wonderful at helping a large group.",

I mean, what Mexican restaurant wouldn't be good if their fajitas sucked??  Def not this one!!  I had the steak fajitas TWICE in my Vegas trip ( I mean, there are only so many meals you can have in your weekend trip to Vegas, right?).     My only complaint is that the waiters could have checked up on us a little bit more...I had to run over to the cabinet area to fetch my own water (boo to that)...but otherwise this place is awesome.",

The dragon berry tea is scrumptious and the margaritas are spectacular!!",

Not only do they make me feel welcome while I'm there, but they were doing it for all the other customers at the bar.  It has a very positive atmosphere and the staff is very inviting.  My group enjoyed margaritas, shots, and some food.  We were well taken care of and our drinks were never left empty.  It happened to be Karaoke night, so it was truly a sight to see.  I want to give a special shout out to Chris, Memo and Bryan.  Thanks for taking care of my family and I.  They had a great time!",

I absolutely love all Mexican food and rarely find places that get tacos so wrong. The shrimp was very chewy (although I will admit they do serve a large portion of shrimps within the tacos - they were just barely flavored and the texture seemed off - not worth it at all) The cilantro rice wasn't bad, but I won't say it was good - it also lacked flavor. Lastly the black beans were inedible. They tasted as if they came right out of the can, barely cooked.  I hate to waste food but in this case I took a couple of bites and paid the check. I was in no mood to explain how terrible the food was but it would have been nice if I was offered an alternative when the tacos were suggested by the staff and barely touched.",

Still minutes later more people began to arrive three more tables were filled up just around us and as I kept glancing from the menu to the tables I realized two tables that were there after us already had drinks, one had chips and drinks and our table was still empty.  Its not real Mexican food and we wanted to try and it but since we got no service, not even acknowledged we got up and took our asses elsewhere.

    "text": "We had dined here several years ago and remembered it being pretty good - unfortunately, tonight's experience was the complete opposite. My family ordered 4 meals and three of them had to be sent back for various reasons.  We asked for no cheese on two of our meals (and it of course arrived to the table with cheese) and we ordered a plain bean and cheese burrito for my son which came smothered in a spicy red sauce. The chicken enchiladas that I ordered (requesting no cheese) came out with a spicy red sauce (while the description included tomatillo sauce and that's what my husband's chicken enchiladas came with). Our waiter took the items back and brought them back prepared which we thought were all correct. My son started complaing that his plain bean and cheese was spicy and then started pulling out long strips of jalpenos and bell peppers (obviously it was not prepared plain). We like spicy food but the chef had thrown jalapeno juice into everything and my lips were burning). Besides the spice, our food was very mediocre and nothing tasted or looked fresh. What made it worse was that they charged us $12.95 for the plain bean & cheese burrito (and I forgot to mention that we asked our waiter if we would be charged the same price as a meat burrito which was $14.95 and he said no, that it would be less). Our waiter tried to be friendly but didn't seem to actually care. We are in Vegas 4-6 times a year and this was probably our worst dining experience ever in the city. Needless to say that this will be the last time we will ever dine here when in town. I guess it explains why there was no wait for a table and a few other restaurants at Planet Hollywood had an hour plus.",

We were seated right away and our waiter was nice and took our order, however he didn't write it down and of course he made a mistake with the order.  We ordered one veggie burrito and one steak burrito but they brought out two veggie burritos instead. (Not a good thing to serve a full on veggie burrito to a hungry meat eater:P).  Anyway, they corrected the mistake and the burritos were really tasty! I also appreciate the amount of guac and sour cream they serve with the dishes. We swapped out the rice and beans for guac and sour cream instead.  I really enjoyed my meal and if I ever stay in planet hollywood again I would definitely go again.",

Half of their menu is varying levels of spicy, without any sort of indication. Usually menus at least try to put a pepper or something to indicate spiciness. We ended up ordering the steak nachos without the jalapenos and a caesar salad. There were 7 nachos in total, with a small piece of meat on top - completely ridiculous for about $12. The steak was very chewy and the portion size was laughable. The caesar salad was okay, nothing that special, but then again, there aren't a lot of ways to go wrong with a caesar salad.   Service was awful, we were not checked on at all during our meal and considering there were 2 other tables there, the service was horribly slow. I can't even begin to imagine how their service would be during peak hours. We were given our bill when we had just begun to eat our food, which made it feel like our server was just trying to rush us out, when the restaurant was nearly empty.",

We started off with chips and salsa, which were pretty good. There wasn't too much spice to the salsa, but it was good.  For dinner I had the beef enchiladas. They were good, but kinda \"eh\". There was no spice and not much extra flavor to speak of.   We had a coupon from the hotel for BOGO margaritas and the margs were definitely good!  Our waiter came by about 45 seconds or so and asked if we were okay or needed anything. We kept telling him no and he kept saying \"Good, no rush\". Having someone tell you \"no rush\" every 45 seconds kind of makes you feel rushed. I don't think we were in here 45 minutes.",

I had a Dos Equis Amber for $6 which tasted like a burnt Mexican Bud Light - yes it was awful.  Should have done the Fat Tire.  And a grilled chicken tostada salad for $12 that was not bad.  Good food and drinks, good prices, hip atmosphere, all at one of the newer Strip properties strikes me as a great deal.    One complaint: the bartender - who gave me the Dos Equis when I asked for a dark beer? - was very pretty and just as rude.  Just a lot of unnecessary attitude.  She reminded me of a quote by the travel writer Bill Bryson:  \"I have no problem with poor service - it makes it so much easier to not tip.\"",

It looked great and my husband and I both being vegetarians liked the looks of the veggie enchiladas and the veggie fajitas.  That's what we ordered. They were great!  I don't know what they do to their veggies but the spices are amazing.  The veggie fajitas were our favorite.  So good.  A little loud due to its proximity to the casino but hey, you're in Vegas.  We would go back. Plus $5 beers (tall ones!).",

As mornings/afternoons can be a rough time, what's better than good ol' American Mexican food.   We got the queso fundido, which was alright. Cheese after a Vegas night is not such a great idea. Quesadilla was decent. Fish tacos were bland. Taquitos were apparently great. The carnitas taco was pretty tasty as well.   Overall, an accessible and medium-priced place for that time that you just want food.   Later in the night, we noticed that if you sing karaoke, you get some sort of deal at the bar. We were intrigued, but did not follow up with the offer.",

My mom and I went before Britney Spears and got margaritas, chips & salsa and dinners. She got steak and shrimp fajitas and I got a salad with steak. Her steak had a lot of fat throughout so she said something to our server. He immediately was understanding and offered some extra shrimp or chicken and then at the end they took the fajitas off the bill altogether! I'm honestly compelled to write this review because of that - the way they handled it. Wanted to call out the strong management and this would probably bring us back.",

We had their margaritas on the rocks and blended and they were both delicious. Just what we were looking for !  Happy hour Drinks and food was $6 each. We ordered chips and guacamole, chips and queso and chicken and steak tacos. While the menu is basic the food is good. Great drinks and good food !

They didn't offer burritos.... what?  They only offer burritos M-Thurs (or something like that.) The chicken quesadilla definitely tasted like something I could have made at home and was unimpressive.  Part of it was soggy (with what?  no idea), and there was dead space along the whole outside of the quesadilla that didn't have any fillings... so it was just bland tortillas.  Meh.

We ordered a couple of them for our group and when it was brought over, one of the first comments was - \" wtf is that smell?\" I really am not sure what was added to those nachos, but it looked like a pile of crap. It didnt taste any better. So for entrees I think the majority of us either ordered the short ribs or the filet mignon. I guess since this was a Mexican place I should've ordered something else, so maybe this was my fault. But the waiter who took our order described the steak to be comparable to some NYC quaility steakhouse cuts. Steak looked nice and plated well but it was lacking some seasoning. Overall I would not recommend this place or ever go again. Afterwards I began to understand the name YOLO, I felt pretty sick and thought I was going to die.

They start you off with some delicious salsa and chips. The salsa was tasted great with some smokey undertones. The chips though were a little flavorless, but that was remedied by a dash of salt.   For drinks we ordered the house and cadillac margaritas on the rocks. I am purest and would drink tequila and lime juice if they offered it. I am not sure how \"pure\" the house margarita was, but it past the taste test. I don't like cadillac margaritas as there are too many liquors in it so I won't review it.   I read some Yelp reviews about the street tacos so we had to order them. One order of chicken and one order of fish.  They brought out 3 soft tacos with sides of pico de gallo, guacamole, rice and beans. This what Mexican Food is all food: simple and inexpensive. Both were cooked perfectly and tasted great. The fish tacos were made with Mahi-Mahi, but I would have preferred a more authentic fish taco made with Tilapia.   I think I will try some other Mexican Restaurants before I come back.",

My boyfriend and I wanted to go to Earl of Sandwich, but when the line was too long we didn't want to wait so we decided to give Yolos a try. Worst decision EVER! When we got there the restaurant was empty and it was 12:30 which is prime time for restaurants. While that should have been a red flag we decided to give it a try anyway. When we were seated the hostess warned us that the waiter would take a while to get to us which I didn't understand because they weren't busy at all. Turns out she was right and we didn't get any service for a good 10 minutes. We thought about leaving but unfortunately stayed because the lunch special was in our budget.    When we finally ordered, our drinks didn't come out for another 10 minutes. The salsa was alright but not very spicy. I ordered the tamales and my boyfriend ordered the burrito-both on the lunch menu for $9 each. My tamales had barely any chicken and tasted bland, the rice had absolutely no flavor, and the black beans tasted like they were from a can. Not to mention the temperature of the food was scorching hot so I could barely eat it at first. My boyfriend stopped eating midway through his meal because he lost his appetite and he is quite the foodie. His burrito steak tasted like pot roast and there was no spice whatsoever. Burritos are not supposed to taste like pot roast people! GROSS! Our server was very polite but he was busy waiting on the entire restaurant by himself so service was extremely slow.   The only positive thing I have to say about this place is that the drink menu is illuminated which is pretty cool, and it has a hip vibe but looks can be deceiving! I was born and raised in Texas so I know how good Mexican food tastes like and this food is very far from it.  Bottom line is don't go here unless you want slow service and bland food.",

Staci Green and her staff were wonderful in their preparations and duties during the party.  Niko and Tony were outstanding in their duties behind the bar to ensure everyone had exactly what they wanted in very short order.  The food served was excellent and the drinks were top-notch as well.  We received many compliments from our party guest about the location, ambiance, food, and drink service.  If you are looking for a fun spot to host a gathering of party-goers in Las Vegas, then I can highly recommend Yolo's Mexican Grill and their bar area.  We had a great time and I'm sure you will too.",

It was about 7:45 or so and the place was pretty full. We didn't have a reservation but were told it would be a 20 minute wait to be sat. No big deal. We saw two spots open up at the bar so we jumped in there!  It took a while for us to get service, but i can let that slide a bit when a place is busy. After getting service i was impressed =)  I ordered up some Chicken Fajitas and well those were the best i have had! Lots of chicken, lots of peppers. It came with some black beans and rice which were also very good. The GF selected the chicken Enchiladas and she said they were on the yummy side as well.  From sitting at the bar, the restaurant its self looked cool, but i never made it inside.",

Vegas...after a full day of drinking in the hot sun by the pool you wake up in the hotel room after a 2 hour power nap and you're ready to get ready for a big night out but then you realize you haven't had much to eat! We rolled into Yolos without a reservation around 11pm on a Saturday night and found 4 seat at the bar. The awesome bartender Chris was nice enough to first hook up our dehydrated asses with some waters and he kept our glasses refilled throughout our meal! I give him credit for not getting a cramp in his wrist! He made some great recommendations and answered our questions. The DJ begun playing some music just as we were getting settled and he was damn good! I was dancing in my seat from the minute I sat down until we paid our bill, I actually danced outta there. I think we should have just stayed at Yolos with the awesome DJ and Chris all night because the rest of Vegas was a bust that night. Anyway, I had the beef enchiladas with the cilantro rice and it was delicious! Yolos has fairly good Mexican food for Vegas and it's very reasonably priced! We'll be back Yolos!!!! See you soon Chris!!!",

Instead we got poor service, mediocre food, and a high bill. Our party had fajitas, taquillos, and enchiladas, plus we ordered chips and salsa. Which would be worth a big bill if it the service and food made it worth it - which it didn't. We will never go there again, and recommend you don't either.

During our entire stay, the booths remained empty.  Then the chips were old and stale. Finally, the mahi mahi came out in a big cube and was absolutely raw in the center.  We sent it back and said we just wanted to leave, but were still charged for the other entree (also not eaten).  Unbelievable!  Never will we go there again.  They lost some very good customers....",

Luckily the mushrooms, asparagus, and potatoes were good so not a total loss. Although not worth the price tag. I mentioned the doneness issue to the waiter and a manager offered us two deserts.

There were 2 other tables with customers when we were there-each with only 2 people at them. I say this because our service was terrible. Terrible. It took several minutes to get a table ready for us, because the hostess was so careful about getting the napkins and menus placed \"just so\" on our table. We were there for 1.5 hours total, and had time for only 1 drink because of the poor service. We were thinking that perhaps we were on a \"hidden camera\" show because we truly felt ignored. The worst thing, however, was a long hair found in one of my group's dish. I know it does happen, and was thankful it wasn't my dish! Having complained about service, I must say that the food was quite good. Sadly, the service really pulled the star rating way down. Again, having read the other reviews, I think we had to have been there on an off-day.",

I give them a solid 4 stars:-  Was in Vegas recently and after many hours travel time, checking in, and dropping bags, was not ready to have a full dining experience. What I really like about this place is efficiency & good quality for $$ spent.  I believe kitchen closes at 10 pm, we arrived 9:30 and sat at the bar. Bartenders shared what's happening that weekend, and gave some good tips. I ordered the Mahi Mahi street tacos, delicious, plentiful, hit the spot, highly recommend them. Cost was $16, ordered Dos Quis Draft Lager $6.. very reasonable as well.  There was a DJ there spinning tunes and we are feet from the Planet Hollywood casino, so lots of energy all around. I'll def be back!",

    "text": "Decent Mexican food at a good Las Vegas price, service on point and quick, and drinks that appeal to anyone.  And it can easily accommodate large groups.  On the drink menu the Pink Cadillac is listed before the Best Buddy Margarita.  This is also representative that the Pink Cadillac (aka Watermelon Margarita) is better than the other margarita flavors (strawberry, raspberry, or mango).  It is sweet (it is a flavored margarita after all), and comes with a slice of watermelon so it must be healthy.  Also watermelon liqueur, which I need to go get some now.  A lot of drinks were ordered by the table, and everyone was satisfied with their choice.  On to the food, and first the appetizers.  It's a Mexican place, so of course one needs to partake in chips and guac.  The guacamole is made fresh at your table, with tomato, onion, jalapeno, cilantro and lime juice.  The presentation is nice, the guac is fresh, and the flavor simple.  The portion of chips is appropriate for the amount of guacamole, but you can ask for more too.  Also under the appetizers are Tostadas, which can come in Chicken Tinga or Beef Machaca.  These are large open tacos with lots of fixings.  The Chicken Tinga came with more flavor than the Beef.  By the time that my entree, the Mexican Gulf Shrimp Street Tacos, arrived I was pretty full.  All tacos come with the options of black or pinto beans, and Mexican or Cilantro rice.  I opted for the cilantro rice, but did not detect any flavor from the cilantro, only the green coloring.  The Shrimp Tacos themselves were seared nicely, and the pineapple-garlic marinade was reminiscent of my time in more tropical locations than Las Vegas.",

Steak tacos -- dry steak meat, and nothing flavorful about it either, and no toppings. The rice that was provided was kind of hard and crunch, as if old, or under cooked.   Nice bartender, who took our takeout orders, and she also gave us glasses of water to sip on while we waited.   The atmosphere/vibe here might be better than the food, but it was conveniently located, and the food came out quickly. Good enough for a quick bite/snack on the go.",

The guacamole is pretty good however the service is also just meh. The managers kept eyeing the room wanting to help but didn't really know where to assist. Not a bad spot to grab a snack at the bar but loud club music and meh service and food make it no bueno for dinner.",

Both of them being margaritas the Pink Cadillac had actual watermelon flavor slightly sour but it's as expected and tasted delicious. As for the Big Daddy Caddy had a more sour lemony taste. So out of those 2 I would say the Pink Cadillac is a must try. You can also build your own margarita if you'd like which I thought was pretty interesting. Bartenders were really friendly and didnt mind explaining the drinks. Not to mention the drinks and good service they have really great music Saturdays if you like Latin night behind the bar they have a decent sized dance floor. Overall it's such a good time.",

The service we received was excellent.  The girls behind the bar were very attentive and friendly.  Both my friend and I ordered a margarita which came in a huge glass and was delicious!  However, the food left something to be desired.  we placed an order for queso but it came out looking (and tasting) like cheese in a can that had been melted down.  In addition to that, I ordered a taco trio which came with a generous portion of rice and beans.  But, when I picked up the first taco, it immediately split in two and the taco filling fell onto my plate! I would not go out of my way to visit this place again.

The table unanimously decided the rice tasted like microwave rice and the refried beans were so pale, thin, and runny that had they been shown to me anywhere else I would not have guessed they were supposed to be refried beans, they certainly didn't have any refried bean flavor left to them. The red sauce on my enchiladas was weird, closer to a marinara then anything I've ever had on Mexican food. When we were initially served 2 of our 5 orders were completely wrong plates. If you are hungry and near here please go anywhere else.",

The entire Planet Hollywood is less than favorable.  NEVER AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!",

Usually it is leaning on the bad side, though.   Their fresh fruit lemonades are tasty and fresh, as well, but I am always disappointed that I pay $4 for only a few ounces of the stuff (about 1/3 the size of their sodas), and that there are no free refills! Come on, YOLOS.  I would give 3 stars, but the fajitas are just that damn good...",

It sits off to the side of the casino floor and the bar seemed to be the place to be!  The restaurant was empty on the other hand.  When we stopped in before the Donny Clay show there were a lot of empty tables and a lot of dirty plates and napkins on them.  I don't know if they were short handed or what, but even though they had 20+ open tables we had to wait for the hostess to clean one up for us.  The plus was she let us pick the table we wanted so we got a nice spot to people watch.    Service was attentive - almost overly so - we had a waiter who came by every 3 minutes to see if we needed anything else.  After awhile it was like yeah - a moment to ourselves!!!  That aside the food was good.  I had the street tacos and they were tasty.  The house margarita was huge and had a nice kick.    It was a good spot, but doubt I would be back.  Been there, one that.",

He was either overwhelmed or distracted b/c he only checked on us a few times, and we ended up drinking somewhere else b/c of how bad he was. We were ready to spend a bunch of money on margaritas, but his service left us w/ a bad taste in our mouth.   The hostess...on the other hand (not sure what her name was, but she had dark hair & was pretty cute) did a GREAT job. She was very welcoming, professional, and friendly. Plus, anytime were called her over (which was a few times) she took care of us immediately  with drinks, water, etc.   Food was pretty good. They make the guac in front of you (I'm always a fan of that). My dad got enchiladas (not sure which ones). He said they were just okay. He mentioned a few times that the enchiladas and the black beans were missing something. My GF and I had some tacos. I had the Shrimp ones (Shrimp Baja  perhaps?), and they were pretty good. The shrimp was a different flavor than I had expected, but different in a good way!  The location wasn't bad, and the \"ambiance\" was pretty good. It was a little on the darker side (not like Darth Vader dark, but with minimal lighting LOL).  I know it is Vegas, and every drink is $15+, but I would have appreciated a bigger margarita glass. The ones we were served was not impressive for the amount. Overall, the flavors for the margs were pretty damn good.",

My husband and I had just checked into our room at PH and were borderline hangry, so we needed some food in our bellies pronto. We downed the chips and salsa like it was our job until we could have a rational conversation again, and then ordered some drinks. I tried the jalapeno cucumber margarita, which was excellent, but my advice is to drink it fast because after sipping it for a while the jalapenos definitely infused the liquid and it got SUPER spicy.   For my entree, I ordered the vegetable enchiladas with cilantro rice, and they were excellent, stuffed full of lots of grilled veggies. The rice was very flavorful as well.   All in all, nothing spectacular, but a tasty, reasonably priced choice.",

It was very spicy and needless to say cleaned out my sinuses (but still, very good).    For dinner I had the tostada salad with grilled chicken.  The salad was pretty big with roasted corn, black beans and avocados.  The servers were very friendly and the food came out really quickly.

I ordered the pork poblino and it was decent.  Nothing really to shout home about.  I'm from San Diego so of course there are tons of Mexican restaurants down here and fast food places that you can get tastier food and pay way less...   One thing that bothered us though was that our friend ordered the steak nachos.  The guy brought out steak tacos because that's what he thought she said.  Instead of saying \"oh I'm sorry, let me fix the problem,\" he basically said, \"i heard tacos\"... like he it was her fault and he wasn't going to help... that was a bit rude... part of customer service is being nice and making sure that if the ordered is screwed up then you see how you can make it better... he did not attempt to do any of that... FAIL!   I really wouldn't come back but I wouldn't tell someone they should never eat there... I would just tell them to find a better option for Mexican food if they can.",

My shrimp tacos were pretty forgettable, I barely touched my beans and rice, and you have to pay for chips and salsa. Lame.  I'm not normally a cheapskate, I swear, but for mediocre food at lunchtime? No thanks. Instead of bang for my buck, Yolo provided a whimper.  You only live once... so go eat somewhere else.",

I must say..I didn't expect Yolo's to be so wonderful.   WOW! What stood out the most was the fantastic service we had! Thanks to our server CJ (lady) she did a fabulous job. Friendly, funny, and a delight. We asked for her recommendations on food and drinks and she delivered. I had chicken enchiladas with cilantro rice and black beans..YUM! We had steak nachos as our appetizer - double yum! and for drinks, I got the strawberry mango margarita! that topped it off. The prices are moderate ranging from $8-$30.   I recommend anyone to head to yolo's for lunch or dinner. I will definitely bring my family and friends here :)",

We just wandered in trying to find a quick but tasty lunch that wasn't a burger or sandwich and were pretty impressed with the quality of food here.    I had the carnitas street tacos, which come three to a plate.  There are also shrimp, chicken and fish options.    The big hunks of shredded pork were plentiful but they were a little bland on their own.  With the addition of some great fire roasted salsa and guacamole though they were delicious and very filling.  I definitely couldn't finish all three.    The double white corn tortillas were very lightly fried just to give them some tooth so they were sturdy enough to hold up.   That was great.  I hate when the tortilla tears and falls apart and you end up with a mess.   My companion had the beef enchiladas, which were topped with a green chili sauce.   They too were moist and the beef was shredded and plentiful.. but they were a bit too salty for me.    Each plate comes with rice and beans.   We tried each type of rice and the cilantro rice was the clear winner for me. The other option was \"Mexican rice\" and it was your standard tomato-based concoction, just not super flavorful.   We didn't bother trying the black beans, we were both just too full.   Plenty of beer and tequilas to go with... all in all a good bet (ha.. no pun intended)... and quite a substantial amount of food for your money.  I would go back.",

I mean it's not super fancy or anything but the atmosphere was great, the food was great, the customer service was awesome!  Our server, Todd (i believe), was extremely nice. They make the guacamole right in front of you which is fun! It was hella good! The chips were hot and fresh!! Then when you add the freshly made guacamole.... OH MAN! I can't even describe... lol You definitely need to order it if you eat here!  They had a lunch special with a salad and an entree for 12.99 i believe... that is what my friend and i did. You can also add a margarita to your lunch for 3.99 which is great!  Our server was great with making sure that everything i ordered was made vegan friendly and he was extremely nice about it! It is amazing how much your server's kindness can affect your experience at a restaurant! Anyway, i ordered a salad minus the sprinkled cheese that was on top and i also got the veggie enchiladas without cheese.. The rice and black beans were also vegan. The food was amazing and i was super excited to be eating a REAL meal after the previous day of eating nothing but bland, cooked vegetables at other restaurants because those were the only veggie options they had.  If you're staying at the Planet Hollywood Resort or you just want a good lunch.. come here! =)",

    "text": "Hidden gem in Las Vegas! I would not have found this place if it had not been for another conference attendee who mentioned it to me. I went with a group of 5 and we had an amazing time. The server was full of personality and made the experience very enjoyable. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made quite a few suggestions on items that we would not normally have ordered. Most of the group ordered the street tacos, but my friend got the pollo rostizado (which was amazing!). The chips are hot and fresh with yummy salsa. We also ordered the guacamole, which is made at the table (highly recommend). I actually may go back tonight....and with all of the awesome restaurants in Las Vegas, that is saying a lot!",

    "text": "the girls and i decided to have brunch here because we needed to stay close by the hotel to wait for our arriving friend and my sister recommended the spot.   before entering, we preview the framed menu on the wall to see if there's anything that looks or sounds appetizing.  apparently, there was a lunch special for $12, that included (from what i remembered) the house margarita for $4ish, a choice of entree on the Lunch special selection, salad and chips and salsa. i remember looking at the entrees separately, and thinking the lunch special was a better deal.    from the lunch special menu, i ordered the carne asada street tacos with mexican rice and a margarita,  which i had  frozen. all were really satisfying. having sides of guacamole, salsa and lemon really helped add a zest of flavor to the tacos. the margarita was extremely refreshing. kinda frothy, but super tasty. sometimes i crave their margaritas, and then start craving margaritas in general. ahh! im craving it now!   the decor of the restaurant is up to date and chic. really neon bright crazy hues. a very fashionably hip mexican restaurant thats for sure.   the only complaint i have is the service. we came around 11am, and the restaurant was hardly packed. it took decades to get the waitress to get our orders. then it took another 6 years for them to bring out our food. we spent at least 130-2 hours there.   im definitely dining here again, when i'm in the area.",

Britney was by far the best, between her original custom drinks, she was just so much fun and took care of everyone!

It appeared to be a really basic hotel type restaurant -- mediocre food for a high price. But we were hungry and had 4.5 hours until our 9pm dinner reservations. We just needed a snack.  The chips and salsa were really good (the chips came out so hot it hurt a little to eat them at first), the guacamole was good, and both the ceviche was good and the taquitos were fine. My girlfriend claims that her strawberry margarita was the best she has ever had. They use real fruit to make their fruit margaritas, so I suppose it's not all that surprising.  The prices were perfectly reasonable.  Vegas' latest trend appears to be the \"sexy\" mexican restaurant. This was not that, but it was tasty... surprisngly so.",

We werent going to let that put us down- we are in VEGAS! so we got our food and that made up for everything. I got the roasted vegetable enchiladas and my boyfriend got the street tacos.

I was the un-official \"concierge\" of our Las Vegas weekend and knew that upon arrival we would be starving and ready to eat. I Yelped PH for on-site restaurant so that we could eat...stat. Yelp came through and gave us this tasty jewel! Upon check-in, I asked the gentleman at the desk if he could make a reservation for us, which he happily did! Bonus!  Atmosphere was inviting, hip, and un-pretentious. I was very impressed with the price-point vs. atmosphere...in Vegas, many restaurants depend on a so-called \"hip\" environment to allow them to boost their prices. Not Yolos! $12 for 3 tacos and rice & beans....and this is after you fill up on their complimentary chips and salsa!  LOVED the chips & fire-roasted tomato salsa. You know you're food is going to be great when the chips are fresh and warm, and the salsa is fresh and tasty. Our server, Todd, made sure that he kept them coming. He also prepared a beautiful table-side guacamole (worth the $8, both price and presentation were spot-on.)  My girls each ordered an alcoholic beverage (I don't drink) . The raspberry margarita was made with fresh berries and Todd even brought a to-go cup for the left-overs...which is why we love Vegas that much more!  Ok...the food, I know I'm taking forever, but you know you want these details! Three of us ordered tacos (carnitas, steak & shrimp) & three of us loved them! I ordered carnitas, cause I'm a pork junky, and I tried the shrimp which was outstanding! Friend the fourth ordered chicken fajitas which were your standard fajitas platter with all the fixins' However, the chicken was plentiful and tasted great!  My only disappointment was the rice and beans...not enough flavor here, AND the margarita fountain that wasn't! I was expecting some kind of rockin' show-piece and it was a lit-up tower with a nozzle...behind the bar. I totally had visions of \"weezin' the juice!\" Boo!  I would come back to Yolos on another trip, and I would sample a few of the appetizers next time! I'm looking forward to it!  Go here.",

I ordered the Drunken Chicken Nachos to cure my (eh-hem) drunkenness and to my surprise, the plain cheese, chicken and salsa had a mild spicy kick due to the perfectly cooked green bell peppers in the green tomatillo salsa.  At first sight I was EXTREMELY disappointed. Plain cheese with the chicken sprinkled over the top splashed with a 1/2 oz ladle of tomatillo salsa.   At first bite I knew what I ordered was right!!! The explosion of the rich cheese and marinaded chicken along with the bell peppers on the salsa made up for the plain look. Lesson Learned: Do not judge a book by its cover!!!  It also helped that the Dos XX was from the tap and much more delicious than the Coronas everyone been drinking. The bartender was sweet and cute as hell!!!  :)",

The nachos had like 7-10 chips, each already having carnitas, guac, salsa, sour cream, etc.. on it, and it was deeelious! I'll definitely come back here and visit the restaurant :)",

They make it fresh right at your table! It was excellent....perfectly seasoned with all the right flavors.  The tortilla chips were hot and fresh and the salsa was nice and spicy. For my entree I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Fajitas. The Portobello Mushroom came served on a hot, sizzling skillet cut into strips. It was so meaty and delicious! They served the fajitas with cilantro rice and black beans....SO GOOD! For dessert we ordered the cheesecake and the chocolate lava cake. I didn't really care for the cheesecake but the lava cake was good. My favorite part about the desserts was the home-made cinnamon flavored whipped cream that came with them. That was something really special. I would definitely recommend Yolos! Food and service were excellent!",

I asked if something less spicy could be made and was told that everything is pre-made. When the entrees came (we ordered the quinoa salad and fish tacos) I found everything so incredibly spicy that I ended up finishing my kids' quesadilla!

I looked up some spots and Yolos seemed to have all the options and variety on the menu that I was looking for. I ended up getting in contact w Jason Carr, who was super knowledgeable and broke down my options for a party of 14 girls to fill their stomachs for the night ahead. He was very accommodating considering I was making plans from Ft. Lauderdale, FL! I We conducted all business via phone and email. Once I got there I was honestly expecting disaster BUT everything went smoothly! Our server, I unfortunately forget his name, was great and on top of things! I was also hooked up with a Blue Long Island or 2 for all my hard work and planning. (thank you Jason&Server!)  Our group chose from the Three-course menu which was great and posed a lot of options for having such a big group. They served appetizer of Chips n Salsa, Salad: Mixed Green or Caesar. Entrees we all had the options of Petit Filet Mignon, Glazed salmon, or Pollo Rostizado. I had the Filet Mignon which was flavorful and tender. :)  Everyone was fat and happy, pleased with the options. We paid per head a flat rate which was a great price and worth the quality of the size meal we received and gave us a great start to our night in Vegas!   Thank you so much Yolos for maing my job as MoH easy and successful!! (;  Kiara~",

You may gasp at this, but for $13 you can order a \"make your own margarita.\"  Where you can pick your tequila brand.  I mean, why you would pick anything other than Patron is beyond me, but to have a set price for Patron is a score in my book... and probably a \"cheap price\" in Vegas!  We ordered a nacho platter which was pretty pitiful.  I think there were maybe 10 chips in it and a spoonful of gauc.  Pretty lame nacho platter if you ask me!    Plus, after midnight, well drinks are only $3.  Now THAT'S a jackpot in Vegas!",

However the menu doesn't tell you that what you get is 5-6 tortilla chips with a single piece of steak, jalepeno, and cheese on them and that's your \"nachos\"...  My son was not impressed and was still hungry... I shared my mediocre taquitos with him.  The tortilla soup was less than impressive and was fairly watery.   Lots of money for sub par food.

It was on cable and my parents liked to leave me at home alone for really long stretches.  I watched it so much, I memorized pretty much all the dialogue and songs in the movie.  I'm old now, though.  So I calculate I'll need to watch this batman movie at least eight thousand more times to memorize it all.  Anyway, the scene where the joker tries to shoot the mayor; the only glimpse we get of him without makeup.  That was about the time I ordered.  About two minutes later, literally, my food arrived.  It felt like I had traveled back in time and ordered before I arrived.  God damn I wish that was possible.  The self I send back would always be waiting in line.   So I got nervous.  Like, this one meal could ruin my whole trip to Vegas.  It still might. I'm writing this waiting for my check.  But the food was decent enough. The service was friendly, and very boobalicious.  Oh, there's was also a very fit, attractive male also.  Vegas must grow em on trees or something.  Good looking people, not hot guys. What?  The bottom line is, if everything else is crowded and you're so hungry you could eat a dead rat off a sewer grate, then try this joint.  Otherwise, earl of sandwich is right around the corner.",

They need new management.  $13 for 4 black shrimp which don't really taste of coconut is ridiculous.

Overall, it's very easy to find inside Planet Hollywood, the bar usually has plenty of open seats.",

Food has always been first class and tonight was no different.   The service by the waitress (when she could come by) was on par.  Management SUCKED.   We ( four of us) were seated and drinks were ordered,  fortunately we all had reviewed the menu on line and ordered with our initial drink order,  The staff then set up a table(s)  that looked for 30.  So our drinks arrive, then our food, but my wife and I are without forks, knives or napkins (setups).   I mention it to the fellow who delivered our food, and he found one setup I gave to my wife.  And he said he would be back with another because THEY WERE ALL OUT! I the waved down what looked like a manager, explained the situation and he found setup, lifted from another table.   We ate our dinner without another visit from the waitress, nor water service, or offer of more drinks.   The large group sucked the air out of the room.  To be fair, I don't blame the waitress,  I blame the pathetic manager who did not have sufficient staff on hand to handle his expected guests ,  And his pathetic response of \"Oh I am sorry\".",

I went back to Yolos last Saturday and presented them my receipt for the free Margarita, but was told by the bartender, that Yolos has new owners and that they no longer honor the free Margarita coupon.  Ended up paying for a Margarita, but apparently the new owners limit the amount of tequila in their Margaritas and I basically paid for sugar water.  I ordered the steak fajitas which were good, but without a couple of strong Margaritas like I've had in the past, didn't totally have the enjoyable dining experience I had in the past.",

I was torn though because the ratings were kind of low, even though the food looked good.  I took a chance, and I'm glad I did!  Service was friendly and fast for the most part.  The chips, salsa, and guacamole were all delicious, although our guac was not prepared table side as others were :( We also had the queso fundido which was really great.  My first drink was the pink Cadillac (watermelon margarita) and it was great.  My second drink was even better though, and I continued to drink them throughout the weekend - it was the \"opposites attract\" (I think that's what it was called?  It was the cucumber/jalapeno margarita).  It was SO GOOD, but not very consistent.  Sometimes the spice was overwhelming, sometimes it was tame.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  I can't remember what all we had though!  I know I had the steak fajitas and they were good.  I don't remember any complaints really.  They don't mess around with the margaritas - they are made stiff!",

It is a good alternative to PH's excellent sit down restaurants upstairs in the Mezzanine area in that it keeps you a bit closer to the casino action.  Our server Damian was one of the best servers we've had on many trips to Vegas and he ranks among one of the better servers we have likely ever had, period. And, in personally eating many times in New York, Chicago, L.A., and Vegas, and with my friends having traveled a lot around the world, I think that is saying a lot. The guy was good -- especially in trying to find the best tequila selections for our group's different tastes. He was like a tequila sommelier. His associate Chris was also very good, and it just stresses one point to restaurants, hire good people. They keep the customers coming back.  Good points -- Yolos is a great higher-end casual restaurant choice that the Planet Hollywood area needs a few more of. It is a step above a bar atmosphere without any sacrifice of fast service, fun, and a good price. And, it is faster than a 1-2 hour sit down restaurant without sacrifice of food quality or unique offerings that are of course expected with some of Vegas' great, higher-end restaurants. All of the food was good and unique. The service was excellent, fast, and friendly.  Bad points -- We were lucky to always sit at the bar area. So, we had good access to the service. Sitting in the other parts of the restaurant might not have been as good or as much fun.",

I was recently at Yolo's in Planet Hollywood for lunch on 3/10 around 2-3 pm and had some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  The experience started off pleasant  with me and my two friends being seated promptly and we were very excited to try the food.  After the tableside guac was made the rest of our group called and decided to join us for lunch and our party of three grew to a party of 12.   I asked the waitress if we could move to a larger table to accommodate the rest of the group and she said she would have to ask the hostess so I went to speak to the hostess and she said she had to talk to the waitress.  All the while there were 3 empty tables right next to each other that could be easily pushed together.  The table to our left was a very nice couple that offered to move seats so we could add to our group but we told them that was a very nice offer but not necessary because there was room elsewhere. The table to the right of us was more interesting because it was the manager on duty who completely ignored us and made no efforts to help us obtain a larger table for our party.  After the three tables had been pushed together and everyone was seated, we started to move our appetizer and drinks over when we were stopped by the waitress, not the manager who was still sitting eating her lunch and staring at us, and were told that every member of our party of 12 was required to order a meal off the menu or we couldn't eat there anymore.  We let the waitress know that a few people may not be eating but everyone was going to be drinking but they still told us that we wouldn't be served unless everyone ate.  We were obviously upset by this since we are such a large group and the waitress would have gotten at least the min 18% tip that is added to large groups so we couldn't understand why they wouldn't serve us.  She told us that her manager had instructed her to tell us this, still while the manager is eating at a table less than 3 ft away from us.  The manager never once came us to us and talked to us directly or even tried to explain her position, the waitress said it was because they were too busy to seat people that weren't eating even though there were at least 5 empty table in the restaurant and plenty of room still at the bar.  We paid for our guac and my beer and left the restaurant to go somewhere more accommodating where every member of our group did in fact order food and several drinks.  The total bill ended up being over $500 for our group and we had a great time elsewhere.   I am so incredibly mad at the manager for being a coward and not even having the \"balls\" to tell us herself that she wouldn't serve us and very disappointed that at a great casino they allow staff to treat guest like garbage.",

    "text": "Our server whipped up some guacamole that was just divine (if you agree that slightly supple, perfectly ripe avocados bring you closer to your chosen God anyhow), and the small talk he made whilst combining fresh lime juice and pico de gallo, avocados and onions, struck me as genuine and pleasant. He actually provided the friendliest, most timely restaurant service during my entire Vegas stay. Huzzah.  The Mahi Mahi salad is filling and well-balanced. The ceviche, though lacking in scallops, glides down your gullet with the greatest of ease. Their free baskets of chips are lovingly sprinkled with cayenne seasoning, too.  And don't forget the snazzy pink and lime decor, bold without jarring the senses. The rest of Vegas, you could take a lesson from this place! Actually, Vegas, I want you to dance 18 inches apart from this gal and keep your hands to yourself. She still seems so darling and fresh-faced.  PS: This place is in Planet Hollywood.",

The whole place is overpriced i mean i know its vegas but still 15 dollars for a margarita in a martini glass?! wtf... we get the chips and salsa and they are pretty good chipotle salsa decent chips.  I ordered the cheviche and it shows up made out of oj and has mandarin oranges in it blecccck way to sweet cant even taste the shrimp laaame.  My friend got the veggie enchiladas and the veggies tasted like oil not even butter which would have been better they did use cotija cheese though.  We high tailed it out of there after that thank goodness",

We got the table-side guacamole as a starter, which is plenty for a party of four--we were only two and barely made a dent. We had chicken tacos and steak fajitas for our entrees, and both were delicious and good sized portions. Service was great--as was the huge raspberry margarita I enjoyed through the meal. I would definitely go back to this restaurant while in Vegas for a meal that's tasty and in a fun spot (Planet Hollywood) but not wallet-emptying.",

Planet Hollywood has two other Mexican restaurants in the Miracle Mile that get so-so reviews and I expected Yolos would be like that but it was actually great.  The food was really good, with more complex flavors than your standard Mexican place of this price range.  We were there for Sunday brunch and they have a special brunch menu which looked good but we ended up ordering off the regular menu so I guess I can't comment on the brunch menu (although it did have a very tempting \"Hangover Stew\" which I would ask you to try just to tell me how it is).  The queso fundido was the best I've had anywhere, and the nachos were really good as well, every chip had a ton of yummy stuff on it.  The tortilla soup was spicy and they poured it over the tortilla strips as tortilla soup should be done.  The guacamole that came on the side of the dishes was very good so I would bet the guacamole appetizer is even better.  The service was a little too in your face, but that also meant that it was very attentive so I guess that's a toss up.  I would recommend this for a good casual lunch.",

After some sporadic gambling with various outcome, i decided to stop here for some food. Im not young, but i was alone so i decided to get one of their open bar seats. One thing i noticed when dining alone is that service often is ridiculously good. No matter if you eat by the bar or not, they seem to care for you more and want to give you all the attention you need.  The sizzling fajitas combo was generous and tasty as it should and they have quite a few interesting cocktails as well. This place is located right off the casino floor so if you dont want the uptempo you should go somewhere else. Service was speedy and precise and they seem to have a great coordination in between each other. .  The name of the restaurant is actually YOLOS which quite randomly involves the Swedish letter \"O\", but in this case i will not make any scene, just go with the flow.  Dont be afraid dining alone at this place in this crazy city, you probably end up having a great dinner, with excellent service while finding some new friends.

We figured out what we wanted for lunch - shredded beef enchiladas for me, carnitas street tacos for my niece. The food took awhile to come out, considering there weren't many people in the restaurant.  The food was worth the wait! My shredded beef enchiladas were some of the juiciest, most flavorful enchiladas I have ever had. There was a perfect amount of cheese, and the green sauce was really delicious.  The rice was really bland, and the beans were just alright. But the enchiladas themselves were amazing. My niece also enjoyed her tacos. Great portions, good prices.",

I had the Queso and street tacos as normal. I also thought I'd be a tough guy and order the salsa Diablo. They were nice enough to replace it with the house salsa after I swallowed my pride. I think they may have noticed I was sucking down ice water like it was keeping me alive.   Anyway, you won't believe this. I still don't believe it myself...  Towards the end of my meal, the manager came by and recognized me from my past yelp review!  I was kinda freaked out!  But how awesome is that!  She had messaged me previously asking how they could improve their service so there was correspondence, but wow!  I was impressed. She walked by and did a double take and was like are you, did you, are you the guy I talked to who left a yelp review?    She was really pretty. Lol. So I may have gotten a bit nervous after that!  Regardless, great food as always, and the Queso Fundido with chorizo is simply fantastic. The service was great. I had multiple people take care of me.  I will go back for sure, maybe even again on this trip!    You don't find sincere personal service like that at very many places and it is appreciated. That's how you gain loyal customers. They gained one today!",

When we told our server we wanted to cancel our order she finally went to the back to check and brought it out. SMH. An order of tacos comes with 3 tacos, rice, and black beans...  It does the trick if you're stranded in Vegas and can't find any tacos if you're craving some. Interesting name too. Can't say anything else about restaurant since we did a to go order.",

    "text": "This was our first place to go for food when we arrived in Vegas on Saturday night. It came as a recommendation from a coworker and we figured we'd check it out.  The Mexican food itself is decent and the prices are reasonable given how fancy the place looks. We ordered tacos and enchiladas, which came with sides of beans and rice. We weren't disappointed in our food at all but I guess we were hoping for something that would blow us away. Or maybe we're just spoiled by awesome quality Mexican food we can get back home?  The winners of the evening though were the margaritas. My partner ordered a classic and I picked out the watermelon. I was actually shocked that my drink came out refreshing and smooth tasting! I was expecting an overly sweet, super intense watermelon \"juice\" flavour that I've experienced in mixed drinks before, but this was very light and smooth and everything I've ever wanted in a drink that involves this fruit.  My suggestion would be to come here for some drinks and maybe a snack or appetizer. Or have many drinks. The tequila menu is kind of mind-blowing.",

First- as a restaurant, it's pretty good Mexican food. Try the cucumber jalapeno margarita! So delicious. The table side guacamole is worth it too. The bar tender had to be one of the dumbest people I've ever met- he messed everything up. From us asking for chicken on our nachos (So, beef, right?) to my bell pepper allergy being translated that I am allergic to everything in the restaurant. Whatever. Except for him, service was excellent. HERE is where the magic happens- At night the place turns into a club-bar. WITH KARAOKE. Yes, karaoke. It's cheaper than the actual clubs, you actually get room to dance, the bar tenders serve strong drinks quickly AND you get to sing off key to a bunch of strangers. The 10 of us ended up drunkenly stumbling here two nights in a row. It was actually a lot of fun.",

I tried guac and chips (so many chips!) and the quesadilla (comes with the option to add onions and peppers- I suggest that). Both were amazing and just $5! $5 also can buy you an excellent frozen or on the rocks margarita (any flavor you want). Came back the next day and tried the chicken fajitas (comes with all the fixins and it was amazing). Had a bite of my friends ceviche- it was okkkkay. Not very fresh tasting but I still enjoyed it. Also it was very spicy. Everything else is awesome! Shout out to Niko for being the best bartender!",

He was GREAT and super friendly!  Gave us some tips on what to order but I ended up with the shredded beef flautas and it was delicious!  3 fat pieces of flautas, covered in some green sauce with very generous servings of guacamole and sour cream. The chips and salsa that came before the meal was perfect too and totally hit the spot.  Chips were fresh and still piping hot when served and salsa that was just right - not too spicy, not too mild!  And did we look totally parched?  Cause I've never had my water filled so much in such a short while!   We arrived around 11pm or so, so the music was bumping and had us dancing in our seats!   Great time was had and I'll definitely be stopping by again for those delicious flautas and to say hi to Chris!",

You can not beat their $10.95 lunch specials (Served Mon-Friday 11:30am-3pm) where you can add a Margarita for $5. At 3pm, their Happy Hour starts which also includes margarita specials. You can't find this quality of food for this cheap price anywhere else on the strip. I always get the steak street tacos that's served with refried beans and spinach rice. Can not beat it!",

The rice and beans were lukewarm. I sent them back and received hot sides. My wife's order was ecletic - street corn, which was overcooked, 3 fried fish tacos that contained fish pieces no larger than her forefinger, and chicken wings, which were good. Her rice and bean sides were lukewarm, but she did not send them back.  Of more concern was the glassware. My martini-style margarita glass had a piece broken off of the stem base, making for a sharp edge. My water glass had a small, albeit sharp, spot on it's rim. Thankfully, I did not cut my lip.  The bright spot was our waitress. She was excellent and handled my \"problems\" courteously and efficiently. I saw her speaking with a person who I assume was the manager. Clearly Yalos tried to make things right. We were not charged for our cocktails and our meals were discounted by 20%. This was a well appreciated gesture, however, the food was not very good overall. I rate Yalos overall at 2.5 stars for the food. I rate our waitress at 5 stars. Unfortunately I did not  get her name.",

The steak and chicken fajitas were cooked well and tasted great but the rice and beans that came with them were flavorless. The margarita was good. The chimichanga dessert was good but the arroz con leche that comes with it tasted old. the rice was either not cooked right or it was stored in the freezer so it was hard and gritty",

Next we ordered the Posole soup and Chicken tortilla soup, Posole great but the tortilla was okay. For entree we had the Chicken taquitos, cold in the middle and the Ground beef burrito with Red Chile sauce, rice and beans.  That was okay as well. Burrito was salty, never had Mexican rice with peas and carrots.  Dessert was Flan,  which I normally always order.  This one was disappointing, really disappointing! It is usually smooth, silky, and custardy.   This one was DENSE with some kind of cake bottom.  Flavor was okay but texture was not. 2 drinks and one soda grand total $105....WHAT?",

I had the street tacos, which were pretty authentic. You can mix and match the 3 tacos you get - I chose mahi, steak and carnitas. They were all good in their own right.

If you've ever ordered atomic hot wings from Wing Stop, they're not quite as spicy but they definitely compare. But enough about hot wings from a Mexican restaurant...  The margarita was really good. Wish I had one right now... I had bites of chicken nachos, a carne asada plate, and beef fajitas--delicious as well. The fresh guacamole is great, too, although I heard complaints about the endless chips being too salty.  I don't know if I would come back to Yolos since there are so many other places to try in Vegas, but I would recommend it to a first-timer looking for fairly-priced Mexican food on the strip.",

He was just right in my book. We started with a couple of margaritas that were quite tasty but not overly boozy along with chips and salsa. Had the crab cake gordita appetizer that I really liked. Then the carnitas street tacos which were very good. My wife had the Shrimp and cheese stuffed chili relleno which was quite tasty too. She really liked it. I'd go back here again for sure.",

I was in Vegas last weekend and met a few of my Dutch friends, and of course they saw this place and wanted to get their grub on.. so who am I to turn down a tourist wish?   The place is actually pretty nice, a full bar right at the front and the layout is pretty clean. I ordered the Mahi Mahi fish tacos with black beans and rice, and I gotta say.. they were the BEST fish tacos I've ever had. Believe me when I say.. I've had me some fish tacos during my life.. but these were just so damn tasty. The dutchies at the table enjoyed their food too, so all in all it was a damn good meal. Only 4 stars because the price was a bit high, but otherwise I'll be back.",

Also, it was really too loud to have a conversation.  I remembered passing Yolos inside the Planet Hollywood casino, so we decided to go there instead.  It wasn't crowded at all, the food was delicious and we had a waiter by the name of Gustavo who was awesome!  Since we hadn't been there before, he made recommendations from the menu and totally took care of use while we had a long relaxing lunch.  I'd highly recommend it if you're in the middle of the strip and don't want the inconvenience of waiting around for a table...",

Made a reservation on Yelp after reading the reviews. Still had to wait when we got there, but we won $21.00 on the penny slots while waiting so it paid for part of the lunch ;)  You have to pay for chips and salsa and we had 3 die-hard salsa fans, so we ordered two orders - which got pricey, especially because there is not a lot of salsa in each order (although what you do get was very, very good).   I had the vegetarian enchiladas and added guacamole (for an extra charge). The sauce could have used a little more punch in the flavor, but all and all it was really good. I enjoyed the cilantro rice as well.  The other two dinners ordered the chicken burrito and taco lunch specials and said they both loved their meal.   Cool drink menu presentation at the table (like an iPad type menu) and the service was good and attentive. I liked how dark it felt in there - good ambience to forget you are in bright, hot Vegas.   Decent meal - I am not sure I would rush back when I am back in Vegas, but recommend if you like a little upscale American version of Mexican food and some good salsas.   (I tried to forget the name was Yolo the entire time I was there - was that named intentionally or coincidentally?)",

    "text": "I've eaten at Yolos plenty of times and everyone I end up getting the chicken tortilla soup. For being a casual eatery open to the casino floor, they make a killer tortilla soup.   This isn't your average soup, you get an experience: The shredded chicken, tortilla strips, and toppings come out in the center of the bowl. Then the waiter pours in the soup itself. Why is this glorious???  Compare your cereal that's been sitting in milk for a bit vs cereal right when milk is poured on it. One is soggy and one is crunchy.   Tortilla strips are meant to be crunchy. Ask for a few slices of avocado and a squeeze of lime. It's the Mexican way to eat it. It adds greatness.   The guac isn't very good. It needs more salt, like, onion, jalapenos, there are no tomatoes, and it's over blended. Leave some chunks in there for texture. I wouldn't recommend getting it if you have guac opinions.   I've also ordered tacos from Yolos. They were surprisingly pretty good. I'd order them again if I wasn't so into the tortilla soup.   The drinks are good. The staff is welcoming and attentive. I've only sat at the bar area, but there is a restaurant area a bit more concealed from being right smack in the casino.",

Yolos is not fancy . . . rather just slightly more elevated than your average neighborhood family place . . . but it's lively, hip and fun.  The decor is bright.  The energy is great.  The service is friendly, attentive and well-paced.  The food?  Actually, pretty good.  Drinks were tasty.  The \"Drunken Nachos\" were incredible.  The \"Street Tacos\" were flavorful, though more mainstream than those you'd actually find at a good street truck, and I personally loved my flank/hanger steak.

    "text": "Post New Years Eve is the THE TIME to hit Vegas up for some deals.  At Yolo, we are talking happy hour $5 deals.  $5 drinks and $5 bites. The street tacos (had both the chicken and beef) were well worth $5.  You get two tacos stuffed with surprisingly yummy meat.  Since you get 2 tortillas per street taco, I suggest breaking them up into 4 actually bite size tacos!  I was salivating over the sizeable plates of $5 tequitos and $5 quesadilla, but trying to maintain my figure I worked so hard on before Vegas, I abstained.   Lots of $5 margaritas were flying out of the bar, but since I can't drink tequila, I stuck with the quite passable $5 white wine.    In the evening, house drinks jump to $10, which isn't too bad.  Especially when they come with a side of karaoke.  *sings* Total Eclipse of the Hotel California, Wanted Dead or Alive, a Sweet Caroline.........you totally just thought \"Buh buh bah\" didn't you.",

The margaritas during happy hour are 5 bucks which is amazing for Vegas and they are strong. I highly recommend them!!  The service is SLOW. They only had one waitress on so you have to be a little agressive and ask for drinks when they pass by but for five bucks, you can't really go wrong!!  Happy Hour is from 3-5 and it's the best one I found on the strip!",

Food - No joke, I got a fajita with maybe two-three pieces of steak.  It's like half of it dropped on the floor and they were like, oh well, only two pieces left.  Serve it up.  On top of that, it was truly awful!  No flavor at all.  I was eating onions and peppers on bread.  That's lovely.  Service - When the waittress asked me about this, I told her.  No complaint, just told her my thoughts.  Now, when the MANAGER came over, he looked completely unprepared, hungover, and like he was in over his head.  He stuttered like a fool, and just walked away.  There was no conversation at all.  Total busch league here.  No people, and I'm a bit shocked they're in business.  By the way, their signs say they have hooka starting at 10PM, which is a misprint, yet they keep the sign up.  Kind of funny.  Trying to be helping:  Go to Mesa Grill, which is the best in Vegas for Mexican (which is surprisingly bad in this city).",

He was very knowledgable about the food and menu choices. We got the table-side guacamole which was freshly made and delicious by a very outgoing young woman who added onions and other ingredients to our liking. Then came our crab cakes and steak nachos as an appetizer. I can't even find words for how amazing they were...they are mandatory every time I eat there now. The service was impeccable, my drinks were kept full and and my server checked back after each course was delivered to make sure my dining experience was exceeding my expectations. The sea bass I ordered for dinner literally melted like butter. Highly recommended and easy to find in Planet Hollywood casino.",

I had to save it for after I finished my food because it tasted like that gum in the Zebra package I used to chew as a kid. Super sweet.  The food was pretty good. We order some dip; I can't recall if it was bean or cheese. The waitress warned us that it was pretty spicy, and she was right. But in a good way. I also ordered the enchiladas which were pretty darn good.  I do have to knock this place on a couple points, though. First, my sister's salad was weirdly salty; she couldn't even finish half of it. Second, the service really dropped off. It was great when we first walked in the door, but became nonexistent after the waitress brought our drinks.",

If you haven't been to the casino/hotel since they did a huge overhaul then you should come visit this whole area. As for dining experiences this wouldn't be at the top of my list. If you are on a budget however this is one of the better places to dine on the Strip if you aren't in a hurry to get somewhere.   A client invited us to dinner here for a dinner and some drinks and it was underwhelming at best. Our server ignored us constantly (even with empty beer glasses/liquor drinks) which you think he would be eager to refill for us. It was after peak dinner hours and he had 4-5 tables at best.  We are a pretty easy going group but walking by our table over and over again with empty glasses of anything is just unacceptable.   The food was an alright blend of Mexican food. Nothing too shocking or blow your socks off on the actual menu or unique items you will be eager to try out.   My favorite part of the meal without question was the table side guacamole they create for you and the salsa. These provided a great snack and I wish I only ate them for my meal. The enchiladas the server recommend for me we not as exciting as these chips/salsa/guac.   If your a tequila drinker (I am not) you can select from over 60 types at the bar here. The place seems like an appropriate place for a quick lunch when you hop off the roulette or blackjack table. The dinner we had here seemed mildly strange and not quite the right atmosphere or vibe. If our server wasn't so bad I think we could of chalked this place up to a 4 star but our lack of drink service put a damper on the night.",

The salad was huge and had a lot of moist, perfect temperature, marinated, real steak.  Move on to needing a quick bite again at PH and I take my mom and cousin.  We ordered the guac...only 1 and a 1/2 avocados for $11.  A little skimpy on the portion.  But they made it table side and it was good.    Ordered the steak nachos...waiter does tell us it is only 7 nachos, not a pile...we say ok, well it was plated w 7 bites, but those bites had that same steak and about 2 1/2 bites of steak to each nacho.  I had to fork and knife the steak, but they were good and filling and we actually left one on the plate.  My mom ordered the steak burrito and again, it pretty much had a real, properly cooked medium rare, very pink, tender and marinated steak inside.  It was served with white beans and I prefer black, but otherwise a good choice.    Wait staff was ok, happy hour at belly up bar only and we called ahead to see if we could use our Caesars comp, but then they said no and we had an ordeal using our points, but the host came and fixed it...they need to communicate with each other...still not sure the deal on that issue, but we had the phone number on our phone where we had called ahead two hours earlier to ask.    This is my go to quick bite when at PH...just always say no to Blondies...beware...really bad.",

It isn't authentic Mexican food, more like Southwestern with a twist. The menu is limited and you have to pay for chips and salsa if you want them ($3 is all). I recommend the chicken enchiladas, caesar salad, and the flautas.",

We ordered the chips and guacamole and when it came... there was just a to go box, with the top part cut off, full of chips...... We waited about 5-10 minutes waiting for the guacamole to come when we finally realized there was a spoon full in the middle of the tray hidden under the chips. IT WAS HORRIBLE!    The only reason this place gets a 2 instead of a 1 is because the manager was friendly. But I will not be returning to this place!",

Since I craved beans and we didnt want to drive off strip it was right there :)  The service is good, attentive for sure. The food is very fresh. I had the chicken fajitas and man had the steak fajitas. I liked the food a lot.  The spices were just right and the black beans delicious and very noisy later :) (yes I grew up in a barn)  The prices are higher than they should, but its the strip and these are tourist prices. But it was a good meal. I didnt sample the alcoholic cuisine since I drank too much the night before (and nearly invited a lady I made out with to the room...) so I stayed sober.  Its so convinient, in the middle of the casino of PH.",

Our waitress was beautiful with an attitude.   The second time we went was at about 1am. There were more of us and we were all tipsy and peckish. I sort of had a crush on our cute waiter from Brooklyn. We all ordered drinks and some chips and guac. Again, everything was just fine. Prices are reasonable. Music is super duper loud.   If I were staying at PH I'm sure I would grab a snack here again.",

Date ordered beer, (seemed pleased) I ordered water (I don't drink, but I should've bought an \"Adios Mother F*cker\" to ease the pain of this date!). For appetizers, The Man Who Will Now Have A Relationship With My Voicemail ordered a bean/queso dip concoction...FAIL!! He also ordered us taquitos. SURVEY SAYS: EPIC FAIL!!  For the main dish, we *gags* both ordered chicken enchiladas. Dear Cooks, Chefs, and Owners of Yolos,  WHEN IT IS YOUR JOB TO MAKE MEXICAN FOOD, AND YOU FAIL TO MAKE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A CHICKEN ENCHILADA, IT IS TIME TO ASK YOURSELF: WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?!!  Will Yolos and The Guy That Doesn't Have My New Number ever see me again? Probably not, and by probably...I mean definitely.",

After looking at the room service menu and realizing that I am not P DIDDY I realized that there was nothing on the room service menu for me in my price range. So instead I went down stairs ordered some food from Yolos and never looked back. Took it to go.   I ordered the quesadillas which were really good. It came with side of sour, guac and salsa. It was big enough for me as a full meal. Plus it was about half the price of the room service food. And they were quick. The meal was ready in about 5-7 minutes.   You'll have to go grab a drink from an ABC store in the mall cause they have drinks too but don't have lids for their cups which when walking through a crowded casinos full of drunks is a necessary.   If I stay at the Planet again I will eat here again. Good food inside the casino.",

This enormous slice of pie was picturesque, so I felt the need to snap a quick shot. This raging douche bag of a disc jockey took time out of packing his gear to come over and tell me \"this is what our world is coming to that you cannot eat a meal without taking a picture and posting it on Instagram,\" he then proceeded to tell my girlfriend and I that we disgusted him. I then had some choice words for him and continued to take pictures just to piss the ass clown off, so if you decide to dine at this place, I recommend not going when this dumbass is \"performing.\"",

I ordered the 3 taco combo, actually my husband and I both did. We both ordered one el pastor, one shrimp and one carne asada. I ordered refried beans and spanish rice.  Our food arrived and looked tasty. I started with a bite of the el pastor taco and it was love at first taste, great flavor.. I knew after filling up on chips that I had to at least take a bite of each one before I got too full to try all three. Geez, I just wanted to keep gnawing on the el pastor but I put it down and picked up the asada taco and sunk my teeth in.. bleeeh.. the meat had no flavor, very disappointing. I got over the disappointment of the flavor lacking asada pretty quick knowing I had that little pastor unit waiting for me to return to him.. I picked up the shrimp taco and took a bite of juicy deliciousness. Man was I wishing I hadn't filled up on chips. I pushed away from the table determined to let my food settle because I was not letting el pastor escape.. I didn't want to waste belly room on beans and rice but I did have to try.. beans had no flavor like the asada and the rice was just ok. Again, I was over that disappointment really fast because I was really just there for the tacos.  Try the el pastor because.. YOLO!",

The only reason i gave YOLO two stars is because of the drinks and the service. The house margaritas were only $5 and pretty strong and tasty! The service was also really good, but unfortunately not good enough to make up for the subpar food.   I just hope that those who dine here do not at all expect to eat authentic Mexican food and I'm pretty disappointed in myself that I have it a shot.   Sorry YOLO!",

    "text": "Located inside of Planet Hollywood Casino area, YOLO's is one of those spots that you come to eat as maybe not the last resort but just under your first pick. I usually hate eating at little places like this inside of hotels because they literally screw you on prices but lets not spend too much complaining about that. It's Las Vegas, the Strip AND a casino! My crew wasn't really in the mood for the whole sit down experience so we took a seat at the bar and just ordered drinks.  I think our bartenders name was Alex he was pretty cool. The signature margarita that they offer is pretty good for I guess what it's worth. I had to add a side note to the bartender to make sure he makes it STRONG because I didn't want to be sober when I got the bill for this simple margarita. Nonetheless it got the job done and the oh so fantastic buzzed feeling slowly came after only a few minutes. Will I be back? Eh...",

Our bartender was attentive and got us in and out in 45 minutes.  Nice! I am not eating grains or dairy at the moment, so he had to check what I could order, I settled on the Mahi-Mahi tacos. They were delightful, served to me all separated in a\"build-your-own\" sort of way.  Everything was tasty!  I ordered a \"Nor-cal\" paleo Margarita, the bartender hadn't heard of them but I talked him through, and it turned out fabulous! This quickie easily enticed me to come back to try a full experience next time we are at PH (Planet Hollywood).",

    "text": "Simple mexican food at its Vegas best...best at overcharging simple dishes.  We ordered the guacamole fresca and chicken street tacos.  Now the guacamole will be made right in front of you fresh, the server will bring out the ingredients in a mixing stone which already has fresh lime juice in it. At which he/she will mix it for you then place it on the table.  Food came out fast but it's street tacos, it's simple. Nothing really stands out with the Mexican rice and black beans. Same goes for the chicken as well. Overall it's something that an ordinary cook at home could make and that's exactly what it reminded me of.  I was eyeing the ribeye but I figured I'd save to eat a steak from a steakhouse.   For those two items and one soda total came out to $31. You could find better options nearby but if you're in a pinch to get food this place will do you some good.",

I saved the rest for later to eat after we got back from a night of dancing, and still good. We then came back to have lunch on Sunday before our flight. We needed something to bring us back to life if you know what I mean. We ordered the nachos, and taquitos. They got the job DONE. Perfect little spot to have in Vegas. I will be back!!!",

While the bar isn't stocked like other bars the bartenders here make great use of the available booze.  They can make amazing drinks on the fly that aren't on the menu.  Prices are better than most strip adjacent bars.  Plus the chips and salsa's are pretty epic. Yeah its just chips and salsa but damn they nail it.  The waitstaff and bartenders are very nice, attentive and fast!   Definitely come in and give it a try especially if you're staying at the Planet Hollywood.",

    "text": "After finding out it would be a 2 hour wait at Gordon Ramday BurGR, we decided to hang out inside YOLOS (they had no wait) for drinks and appetizers. I was first impressed by the large, long booth we were sat at. That quickly changed when the people at our table kept kicking each other. There was no room under the table for us to sit comfortably. Our server was quick to take our drink order and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu.   We ordered a \"Quesadilla\" priced at $10 and \"Empanadas\" priced at $10 for our snackage. The quesadilla had jack cheese, onions and peppers inside. It also came with a side of salsa, sour cream and guacamole. The quesadilla was good, but average. If you want beef, chicken or shrimp in it then it will cost you $4-$5 more. The empanadas were well liked by hubby and I. They were stuffed with chorizo and had a green chile avocado salsa underneath them. The only complaint I have about that dish is the size of it. They put enough of the green chile avocado salsa on the plate so why not add just 1 more empanada to make it an even 4? If this were a cocktail party I could understand the small bites and portions, but this wasn't the case. With 4 people at our table it was awkward so hubby and I just ended up splitting one of them. The margarita did taste decent!   They have lunch specials during the week that right now start at $9.95 and a Happy Hour at the bar as well. Also beware about the music inside this place. it's very loud and it's hard to have a conversation with the people sitting right at your table.",

First, we were seated right away and that was great because we were starving, but it was empty but for another table sitting next to is. The place was cute, clean, simple, and almost right on the casino floor so people watching was fun. The food was good but the rice was not warm at all, room temp at best. Our server Randal was great and informative and even mentioned I could take my beergarita with me if I couldn't finish it, it would've been nice to have him transfer it in to a cup for me as when I poured it myself I made a mess of our table. Overall, a better than average experience!",

I must say that the service/bartenders were on point, very courteous and worked as a team to take care of the customers, 5 stars to Alex and the rest of the bartender crew!!! As for the DJ(Ramsy), at first he did ok and played a good mixture but then got stuck on just playing Cumbia and Mexican music with the dance floor empty. I went to request a specific salsa song by Marc Anthony and his comment was disgusting! He proceeded to tell me with an attitude that he just played salsa 2 minutes ago and turned around and ignored me. A really good Dj takes the time to play what the audience/dancers would like. I didn't expect him to even play it right then either and just thought he was very rude and for that reason, I won't be going there any longer if I know he's the Dj! I will definitely be spreading the word to my clients and military friends to not waste their time and go elsewhere. That's too bad!!!! Someone really needs to have a talk with Ramsy and teach him common courtesy and respect.",

I ordered the street tacos carne asada and cilantro rice, black beans. I personally didn't care for the carne asada the marina is with pineapple which gives a sweet taste. The cilantro rice very good. Restaurant is busy so you may get a little ignored . Overall a great place and worth the try.",

Service was okay considering it was half empty. This is absolutely atrocious. You would find better food at a Chipotle or something. There's a reason this restaurant is empty compared to a sandwich shop. Never again.",

Coming from Hawai'i, my mom, aunt, and I decided to dine here our first night in Vegas. We started off with a few Cucumber Jalapeno Margaritas and some Guacamole and chips. The Cucumber Jalapeno Margarita was so refreshing and tasty. I've never heard of such a drink, and I'm glad we tried it! The Guacamole was also very creamy and refreshing, just to my liking. Then, amongst the three of us, we decided to order the Sea Bass and the Shrimp Relleno. The food is fresh, tasty, and pretty inexpensive if you ask me. Great, quality food without emptying your wallet! When I do return to Vegas for a visit, I'll be sure to visit YOLOS at Planet Hollywood.",

So we went here and was surprisingly amazed at the quality of this food.  We started off with the Salsa Trio as a group and then I got the Street Tacos Dinner (Chicken Breast, Pork Carnitas and Mexican Gulf Shrimp).  Honestly so good.  This place is dirty cheap.  People who are getting upset regarding cost must be used to eating Fat Burger or In N' Out.  We had four guys who ordered meals and boozed and it was under $100 bucks.  DISCLAIMER:  I had been drinking most of the day (and previous night) probably had a slight sun stroke and was up around $400 bucks.  I was feeling pretty good so I hope this does not bleed over into my usual unbiased recommendations.",

Karaoke WITH PEOPLE DANCING TO THE KARAOKE and a lively clientele late into the night? Yolos. Super friendly bartenders (especially the sweetheart Nicolette)? Yolos. My only complaint was that they closed at around 11pm on Monday night, which probably just meant it was me who needed to get a life, as it seemed to be a pretty standard closing time on the strip in general.",

And then the bartender told us we just had to make sure we stayed covered. After ordering and getting a few drinks the terrible manager lady came by and told us we had to leave because we had swim attire. After telling her we weren't staying at that hotel and were already told two people we could stay there it wasn't right that she was making us leave. She gave me a dry apology and said she could make our food to go. Poor service and poor attitude. If you're not going to serve people in certain attire and you're a half bar in the casino not even a real restaurant on its own at least have a sign posted. Or honor what your employees already said could be done. Period.",

We had a reservation and still had to wait 20 minutes The margaritas were an absolute joke.  We had to send them back... they came back with new ones and they tasted just as watery as before.  Chips and Salsa  - mediocre Drunken Chicken Nachos - not good.. watery.. no flavor Mahi Mahi Tacos - not bad.. a little bland but not terrible.. the beans that accompanied it were awful though Margarita - arguably the worst margarita i've ever had",

    "text": "I found Yolo's to be a relatively decent restaurant offering pretty traditional mexican fare in the middle of a huge casino. The prices are very reasonable for strip food (about $15-$20) a person, and the portion sizes are just the right amount. Top that with chips & salsa as well as hand made (in front of you) guac, fantastic drinks, and snappy service, and you've got the makings of a sleeper.  I found the chips and salsa to be very good for snacking - they offer a very good house made salsa with warm chips that really offer a sweet and salty mix.  We also ordered two blended drinks, of which the name eludes me because we were faded as hell - but one tasted like starburst, and the other tasted like a lighter less sweet pina colada (which is damn good).  Ordered the chicken nachos, which I found to be a little weird because the chips were soggy, not crispy (which probably meant microwave cheese melting action as opposed to tossing it in a oven). The chicken was shredded and plentiful, and the cheese covered the spice covered chips very well. I only wish we had some extra sour cream, some house salsa, guac, and some sweet chilis.  Everything else on the table looked very good, and everyone left very satisfied and full.",

Hubs got the gaucho streak which was ginormous.  He didn't speak much during dinner, so I know it was that good!  I got the grilled mahi mahi street tacos with a side of black beans, guacamole and pico de gallo.  It was ok.  They had this spicy mango salsa that complemented the fish just right.",

Be sure to make reservations because it can be quite a wait come dinner time.   Like most Mexican restaurants, they start you off with chips and salsa. Salsa was good although a bit garlicy. Chips were fresh and not greasy so that was nice. We had a couple appetizers (crab cakes and shrimp ceviche) and fajitas. Everything tasted good and service was great. The drinks, although good were, too sweet for my taste.  The decor is cute too. I felt it had more a girly vibe because of the all the hot pink. Convenient location and worth trying if your staying at the hotel.",

The salsa was disappointing though. The only strange thing is that to make a to-go order you must do it there, they can't do them over the phone. Which is inconvenient because we were staying at the hotel it was in. That aside it was a pleasant experience, we even ate their twice during our stay!",

There is always a fish sauce or chicken stock in different sauces and sometimes you never know until you feel ill after eating.    Starting with the hostess we asked about Yolos vegetarian accommodations and we were assured that sauces and beans were all prepared vegetarian.    Our server, Todd, was very helpful, friendly and informative about what dishes we could eat and what he personally enjoyed.  The menu also makes it easy to decide as there are easy choices for non-meat eaters.    The food tastes great, the atmosphere is inviting and the staff is really good at what they do.  We had the adobo vegetable enchiladas, queso fundido and quesadilla.  everything was tasty and satisfying.    I recommend Yolos.",

After doing a lil' Yelp research, we decided on Yolos, which is tucked away inside Planet Hollywood.    So glad we decided to come here!  We sat at the bar, so there was ample people-watching for me - everyone in the restaurant PLUS the open side to the casino.  The prices weren't terrible - could have been a lot worse elsewhere - my chicken enchilada was around $12 (and delicious!).  Entrees like fish and steaks were $18+.  Sadly, they made us pay for the chips and salsa, which I think were around $4 - BUT the chips were pretty good and they came with a nice selection of four salsas, each very different from each other.    Definitely recommended!",
