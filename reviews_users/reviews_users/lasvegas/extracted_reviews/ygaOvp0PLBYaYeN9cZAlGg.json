    "text": "This place is legit.  Its one of the best pho experiences I've had in a while. I ordered the flank pho. The broth was sooo full of flavor, the flank was just right, veggies were fresh and crisp, the egg rolls were absolutely delicious.  That broth tho  I don't know if it was just me,  but the portion size seemed really big as opposed to other Pho joints. MSG was kept to a minimum, because i didn't require multiple glasses of water just to get through my meal, OR afterwards either.   Its perfect for a group! Nice, clean and spacious.  Plus they have oxtail Pho, (which I've never seen before) and lots of other interesting items on the menu that i cant wait to try.  All in all, I had a great experience. I'll be coming here from now on.",

The bo nuong vi dish comes out w/ a huge platter of asian herbs & veggies with 2 dipping sauces, for you to wrap it your rice paper after grilling your beef! Their pho was OK, the fact it came out piping hot with perfectly cooked noodles & steak on the side as requested...I have nothing to complain about.  Customer service could be improved a bit, everything is so rushed at times but I expect that from any Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas.",

I grew up eating the authentic stuff, so I was skeptical about finding a place I liked here in Vegas. I really liked this place though. Always busy. The biggest thing for me is that the broth is not watered down. It has that savory taste to it. Recommend to anyone who's looking for good pho. And the portions are huge as well.",

It had a lot of reviews and 4.5 stars, so how could it disappoint? It was less than a 10 minute drive from The Mirage.   We ended up visiting VNB twice during our trip and we were never disappointed. The pho broth is so clean yet flavorful and the portions are definitely generous. Egg rolls were super crispy and piping hot. They were served with lettuce, mint leaves, cucumbers and pickled carrots & daikon. I took everyone else's advice and ordered the Bun Bo Hue. It was truly so rich with flavor; you could see the lemongrass bits floating at the top of the bowl. Add a little sate chili and you're good to go.   This place will definitely be on my list next time I come back to Vegas!",

The pho noodles are good (aren't they always) and the meats that come in whatever variety of pho you choose are plentiful.    The deep fried egg rolls were tasty and served hot.  I'm glad - been to one too many places that makes them in advance.  The service is typical for a pho restaurant: attentive until they think you've been there too long, LOL.  But if you go there just to eat, and not to socialize after for too long, the service is very good.    Parking availability at 7:00 dinner time was decent but I'm not sure what it's like during the day when more businesses are open.",

We decided it was too much work trying to roll our food up in the paper wraps. We asked for more lettuce leaves but they never came.  In conclusion we will go elsewhere next time and order food cooked and served ready to eat! The pho looked good and other plates all prepared would've been a better option for us.",

This place is not too far from the Strip (about 10-15min). The service here was phenomenal. The whole staff is extra courteous and they constantly check to see if you're ok with food and drinks. The food here is really good as well. I got the spring rolls and bun with cane shrimp and pork and it was delicious. The portions of noodles, lettuce and meat were perfect and the flavor of the cane shrimp was so good. I love peanut sauce and without asking they brought extra peanut sauce. So nice and amazing. The Vietnamese coffee here is really good too.  If you're craving Vietnamese make sure to check this place out.",

I prefer coming here rather than so many other pho joints in town primarily because the soup here consistently packs flavor, the portion I pay for always exceeds my expectations, and the service is really friendly and quick. It can get pretty smokey in here whenever a lot of people happen to order the tableside barbecue items, but otherwise, I like the overall ambiance of the restaurant. I'd recommend getting an iced milk coffee to go with your pho, and a side order of goi cuon chay.",

Beef and shrimp grill with wrap-  you grill and wrap it yourself  which is  some work but so worth it bc of the sauce.  The brown sauce was awesomeness but the quality of meat was not so great and if it was marinated a little more I would have found the perfect place. Darn! The brown sauce has a pungent smell but tastes great, add the red chili sauce which tastes so much better. Yum..   Seafood udon - had clear udon noodles which had good flavor. The flavor wasn't too much or too little.   Shrimp fried eggrolls- it was nice and crispy  If you thought it was helpful, please hit those buttons [helpful, funny, cool or send me a compliment ]  Thank you and happy eating!",

The delicious sauce to dip the rolls in with a variety of fresh vegetables.   Of course, we always get pho. The aroma of the broth is like homemade. And bun bo hue is also tasty.   Before finishing, there is one important thing about this place. SERVICE. Everyone is here is friendly. Service is 100% genuine. They don't give you faces if you make them come back and forth on your table. They will get you all you need. We have kids and they make messes and they need this and that. The servers here are super kid friendly. They will treat your kids like customers and not just kids. They will make food for them to eat to their likes.   I highly recommend to eat here. No place is better for the feeling of homemade food:)",

The staff is friendly and attentive and the pho was yummy. I got the combination pho and added meatballs. When it comes to pho it's all about the flavor of the broth. You can tell if it's been cooked for hours with the bone versus something instant and oh my did they do an amazing job!  The pho broth had lots of depth, not too oily like some places and the meat was plentiful. Loved that there was tons of tendon in there. Oh and my small bowl was huge! Lots of noodles and lots of broth. The veggies that came with the pho were super fresh too. Perfect sprigs of basil and plump crisp bean sprouts.   The chicken spring rolls were very good as well. Fresh lettuce and freshly grilled chicken inside. And I throughly enjoyed my meal with fresh coconut juice and of course some of my fiance's Thai tea.   I can't say enough about this place. I'll definitely be back to try other items on their menu.",

I didn't know what I even wanted to eat but I've had Bo Nuong Vi at a restaurant in San Diego, and when I saw it at this restaurant, I HAD to get it. And I wasn't let down. I ordered the beef already cooked because that's how I've had it in the past, but the portion was small there.. Here we had enough for 3-4 people! My mum and I shared 1 order and had plenty leftovers for later.  The part that really stood out here was the SERVICE! They were amazing. They checked on us numerous times if we needed anything and really went out of their way to please us. And as someone that works for a company that prides themselves in great customer service, I personally saw the best customer service a restaurant could provide. You have amazing staff and I look forward to returning again. Thank you!",

We arrived for early dinner at 5, so lots of seats.  However, we have to return an utensil because it was dirty.  Gross.  While eating, they came by and asked if we were \"done\" with our half-eaten oxtail pho and wanted to remove it!  Not sure if they were in a rush, but there were lots of empty tables.  So, I don't think I'd return.",

    "text": "Viet Noodle Bar is my family's go to place for Vietnamese food.  Both of my parents are 100% Vietnamese and they are extremely particular on where they go out to eat for Vietnamese food so I think it is saying a lot when my parents and I come here regularly.  The service is always consistent, friendly, and efficient here.  The place is a lot nicer than some of your typical Chinatown restaurants here in town and it is very clean too...always a plus.   Our go to dishes: -Pho (Small Bowl - $7.95/Large Bowl - $8.95) - The small bowls are quite large so keep that in mind, usually I get the Pho Tai (rare steak) and it is delicious.  The Pho Dac Biet is another good option if you want everything in your pho.  Be sure to use the fixings they give you in your pho too!  I like to use some sriracha, hoisin sauce, bean sprouts, and lime in mine.  -Com/Rice Dishes ($8.95 for one choice of meat/$10.95 for two choices of meat) - This dish you get a generous helping of rice, side of cucumbers, and side of pickled carrots/radishes.  For the meats I usually like getting the pork chops or the short rib options, super tasty and super flavorful.  Be sure to use the fish sauce (nuoc mam) to dip the meats in...sounds weird dipping meat into a fish sauce but trust me just do it!  -Bun (noodle dish)($8.95 for one choice of meat/$10.95 for two choices of meat) - Comes with noodles, lettuce, cucumbers, peanuts, and your choice of meats.  I usually get the egg rolls (cha gio) and the charbroiled pork (thit nuong), again it is imperative you drizzle the fish sauce on top of this dish too! -Bo Tom Muc Nuong Vi/Nhung Dam ($29.95 enough to feed 2-3 people) - This dish you basically make your own spring roll and they bring out a small grill for your table to cook up your own meats.  Comes with beef, shrimp, and squid.  Definitely for the more adventurous!  Prices are reasonable, service is good, and the food is always delicious here.  If you are looking for a solid Vietnamese restaurant, go here!",

The only time I've had it is homemade so it was refreshing to have it in a restaurant setting. I ordered bun thit nuong with mam nem instead of fish sauce. My sisters ordered pho and my cousin and his wife ordered bun thit nuong chai gio, my bf ordered chicken porridge. All which were really good and flavorful. No one had any complaints and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas!",

They also have Caravelle pepper sa-te sauce, which is chili in oil. I love this stuff. It's not on the table, you have to ask for it.   Minus one star because: -I don't like how they switched to smaller bowls.  -One time the noodles were soft and the broth was not hot. Hoping it was a one time occurrence. -They play their music way too loud.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place because of its amazing Yelp reviews and also wanted to try their oxtail pho. The first time we came here the place was too packed we didn't have the time to wait. This time around 5pm on a Tuesday night there was no wait.   The place is super nice and clean, that's a plus! We ordered the oxtail pho which doesn't come in a small size so plan on sharing it with someone because it is huge. My husband got #9 pho small size with brisket and a side of meat balls. You can get the size of meatballs in 4 or 6 pieces and they are very reasonably priced.   For the price you pay and amount of food you get this place is good! They're noodles on their pho noodle soup is  perfectly cooked!   The broth is good, not too salty and not oily at all. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star  is due to lack of flavors. I ate the oxtail and it was super bland. Even the meatballs and brisket. It was sad because I expected too much from this place. Not sure why the meat flavor is missing to be honest. I've eaten at a lot of pho restaurants and most of them have really good meat like for brisket you get that after taste and meatballs are super tasty. While eating the oxtail meat I had to constantly dip it in the soup to add taste. Over all this place is good, service is fast and the price is just right.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I've been coming since they opened and this has been one of my go to spots for Vietnamese food. I think things started off better when I first started coming and lately it has been slightly declining, but it's still very good. It used to be a 4-4.5 experience for me and this last visit was maybe a 3.5.  My wife and I came last weekend with a friend from Cali and he loved the food.   We started off with 2 plates of spring rolls, one with charbroiled pork and one with charbroiled chicken. Both were pretty good.  Our friend ordered the Bun Bo Xao Xa (31) which is the Vermicelli bowl with lemon grass stir-fried beef. He devoured it and said it was right on par with the best places in Cali, and a huge portion.   My wife ordered the beef stew with egg noodles. This is usually one of my go to dishes because I love the flavor of the broth and the texture of the egg noodles is slightly firm and bouncy and the beef is usually fairly tender. Unfortunately, the noodles were really soggy this time and the flavor was pretty good, but it just wasn't the same as times before. She left a little unsatisfied because she was craving the noodles specifically and they just weren't up to par.   When I order pho here, I usually get the combination or some combination of flank, brisket and rare steak. This time I decided to splurge and I got the ribeye pho. I have no idea why I didn't order this sooner because it's worth the extra $2 for such better quality beef and it was extremely tender. The broth was pretty decent, but I seem to remember it being more flavorful in the past.   We also ordered a side of charbroiled beef for $3.99. We usually order a side of charbroiled pork. First few times we ordered it, back when it used to only be $2.99, it was more flavorful and tender. The flavor was decent but it just wasn't the same.   Needless to say, I'm not as happy as I used to be when dining here. But I'll definitely be back, in hopes that things get back to how they used to be.",

Wasn't too sweet due to tomato or salty. The flavor was crabby and it was the perfect bowl! Only bad thing.....was a little pricey ($12.95) than what I'm use to in CA. - Better than my mama's. I asked for extra mint and jalapeno and they brought me HUGE plate of it at no extra charge. They also provided extra napkins in a cute little basket.   They have a full bar menu.

When we came, we found out though that they don't have veggie broth(my wife can't eat the beef broth for health reasons). After this, she decided upon a grilled pork dish with rice, and I chose the combination pho. After ordering, a large table came in and sat next to us. I mention this because, this large table ended up getting their food before us.   My wife got her food quickly, but I literally waited for 20 mins for my pho(if you know anything about pho, it usually takes no longer than three to five minutes to get out to you). Turns out that the rude man(typical, and usually a good sign for a pho joint) somehow totally forgot to order my pho(even though he wasn't even the one taking care of the large party). So after this large tablet got their food, I ended up getting mine a few minutes afterwards with out any apology.   The pho here wasn't even good, mixed in with the below average pho service(yeah below average for even a pho joint), I would not recommend this place to anyone. STAY CLEAR AWAY FROM HERE!",

They made everything from pho to banh canh to banh hoi.  I had the Bun Bo Hue. It was so satisfying although I wished it was a bit more spicier but nothing some satay could not fix. The soup broth was so flavorful.  I also had the eggrolls and they were delicious! I could have just survived off of eating those. The filling was not too heavy or dense and they were fried to crispy perfection!  The service could have been a little better. The woman who sat us put us in a corner and they kind of forgot about us.",

Their service was okay, they didn't get our calamari that we asked for and the fried chicken wings took forever. My friends got their pho and liked it. Big portions. I got the Bun thit nuong and it was just okay. Not the best in town but definitely a large portion and had the basics in it-- vermicelli noodles, lettuce, meat, and cucumbers. I had to add the bean sprouts. The fish sauce wasn't as flavorful as other places and I've had better tasting pork. But, thank goodness for lime wedges to add some tangy taste. My mouth is watering as I think about it.",

Pretty spacious and they play back all the 90s jams in the background. Service was super fast and staff was super nice.  I had the Bun Bo Hu and we shared some crispy egg rolls. The Bun Bo Hu was pretty decent, It had a lot of fatty tendons and meats and pig blood. The soup was pretty good, I wish it was a bit more spicier. It came with a lot of mint leaves and basil, which I LOVE! As for the egg rolls, they were pretty good and very crispy, it came with pickled veggies and lettuce.   Overall, pretty good place to get your pho cravings out of the way during your Vegas trip!",

I ordered the Oxtail Pho, while my partner had the Beef Stew Egg Noodle Soup. The Oxtail Pho was excellent. The meat was very tender and the broth was tasty, without being greasy/oily. The Beef Stew Noodle was also tasty, but the meat was not all that tender so my partner wasn't too thrilled with it. I think if they kept the meat cooking for a bit longer, then the beef would be more tender - but other than that, it would have been a real winner.  Instead of being turned off by the not too tender meat of this order though, Paul managed to still have us leave happy. He automatically offered to take it off our tab and also asked if there was something he could replace it with. Not feeling hungry at this point, he asked if we wanted something to go instead. We opted for the spring rolls to take home with us. When he came back with our to go order, he also brought us a complimentary dessert.  While I know some people complain just so they could get something for free, we gave our feedback so they could make improvements (specially since this is newly opened). They turned this negative into a positive. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Writing this review was hard for me because I have been twice and the first time was a late night to go meal and the second time was a meal during lunch time.  Lets start with the first visit.  It was around 1-2 am on a Sunday night, my family just finished adventuring on the strip and I went to go pick up four bowls of pho to go so my parents can eat at home and sleep before they had to travel back to California. The service was super solid, everyone was super nice working there.  It took them a bit longer for my food but I was chilled to sit back and relax.  They gave my a cup of water and after I got my items I went home.  The pho was very flavorful and the bowls were huge.  I give my first visit 5 stars overall everything was great.  The second time around though not so much.  My sister and I went on a Wednesday a little after 1 pm.  It was not too busy and we sat down after they old us what table.  The service was not as good as the first visit and it was a bit slow.  we ordered the rice platter, the cold noodle bowl, and the banh xeo which is a Vietnamese crepe.  The crepe was mostly filler where it was 85 % bean sprouts and my sister and I were super surprised to see button mushrooms in them.  It didn't really bring any flavor to the dish.  rice dish was super disappointing.  The pork was bland, the fish sauce was bland as well.  My sister did not like the noodle bowl either.  Overall it was pretty disappointing.  I grew up in a pretty old school Vietnamese household and these dishes were staples to my life growing up.  Maybe it was just a bad day, I hope to return in the future to see if there is any change.  Or I should just get pho here instead.",

    "text": "3.5 stars. Solid Vietnamese food at super cheap prices.   This place is surprisingly clean and nice, while also serving up authentic Vietnamese food. There's a lot of options on the menu, although we mainly focused on pho.   Oxtail Pho - The oxtail was super tender and delicious. It's a massive portion size though, with 3 large oxtails in the soup.   Pho Bo - Get it with tendon! Super soft and delicious. The tripe was unimpressive, I'd probably skip that. Other meats were okay, but not quite as good as the oxtail and tendon. These soups are also massive so a small was enough to fill me up. Some in my party did note that the soup flavor was a bit lacking, a bit too bland.  Bun Bo Hue - It's quite different from pho, with a different soup base. It tastes more seafood-y and balances the spicy and tangy flavors quite well. Personally I prefer the taste of normal beef soup, but some in my party loved the soup base. The contents of the soup were interesting, although nothing particularly stood out. The pig blood was quite lackluster in the soup.   Spring roll with charbroiled beef - I liked that they cut this up for us into halves to make it easier for us to share. The beef wasn't quite and tender as I'd like, but it paired quite well with the fresh veggies.   Spring roll with shrimp and pork - This was refreshing although it wasn't my favorite rendition. The peanut sauce was interesting, there was some coconut flavors (milk?) mixed into the peanut dipping sauce.  What I really wish was that we had tried the BBQ beef dish to wrap into spring rolls, but unfortunately my group was feeling pho more than BBQ meat.  Perhaps not the best pho I've had, but it was satisfying and cheap.",

When I tell you I'm a critic of great pho I stand by this. I spent 3 months in Nha Trang and I know authentic Vietnamese food. With that being its all about the broth.  My friend from Vietnam introduced me to Viet Noodle Bar last year and it's the only place I'll go! By far the best! Their broth is always so fresh and super hot. Nothing is more dissatisfying to get midway though a bowl and it's no longer hot. I've even ordered delivery though Postmates and it's the same quality. I'm also a huge fan of their Bun Thit bowl - so yummy! I cannot rave about the place enough. Everyone is so friendly and honored to serve you. Especially the owners. It's 115 degrees outside and I just got a craving for Pho. Thank God for Postmates!",

AMBIANCE:  located on the edge of Las Vegas' Chinatown, it is in a small strip mall with ample parking.  Inside, there is plenty of booth and table seating, and several televisions.  It is overall clean and open late (until 2:00 am).  VALUE:  is good for what you get.",

It's actually really soft and it tastes really fresh and yummy (: you know what's also yummy ? Their Thai tea OMG. The Thai tea they serve is in a HUGE glass and the Thai tea doesn't taste like crap either. It tastes like authentic Vietnamese brewed Thai tea made with SOO much tender love and care. If I could I'd come here everyday for their Thai tea. The spring rolls are made with perfection too, so their food is 10/10 The service was like 9/10 they didn't make too much of an effort but service is overrated anyways it's all about the food and cleanliness and the place was spotless to me.  I didn't order any desserts but I will definitely be back here! They close 2 am most days and they're located in the same plaza as 'is sweets' at the corner closest to the street.",

However, Viet Noddle Bar left a great impression. Is it my new Pho place?  Their establishment is very clean and the staff is exceptionally friendly.  As far as the Pho?  Fresh, not too oily, and the food arrives quick.  I've had the pleasure of visiting this place on two occasions.    The second time, our server had a slight language barrier but he was very friendly and really made the experience that much better.  It was obvious our waiter went out of his way to ensure that we enjoyed our experience at Viet Noodle Bar.  In fact, our waiter was so friendly, I truly added a very positive vibe to our dining experience.  What a friendly fellow.    My only suggestion?  Chilly oil - it is a bit pasty. Overall, the food is superb and the service is what every dining experience should be.",

The place was clean and large enough for big crowds. The food however was a let down. Despite the high review the food was anything but quality. The pho was very bland. Imagine for a second sipping your first sip of the broth expecting a warm aroma of pho spices and you get a watered down version. The natural sweetness of stewed beef bones missing from your bowl of soup. What's left for you to do is to drench your soup with hoisin sauce which's makes your pho a hoisin bowl. Having this bowl of pho was like a phantom itch that you can never scratch. You know it's pho and there's a hint of pho but it never delivers a satisfying taste.",

    "text": "I continue writing my first reviews for places I've been to before -- this time around, we're going Vietnamese! Viet Noodle Bar is one of many restaurants in Chinatown that serve pho and other specialties, but for me it's the hands-down best place for Vietnamese, both for value and for the service. Everything is so quick and yet so good! It was especially perfect for me as I was feeling under the weather thanks to said weather having problems deciding if it wanted to be hot or cold.  I usually go for the beef spring rolls and the combination pho with a side of ribeye because you get a bit of everything that way. The beef spring rolls are my favorite because you get the richness of the beef, but they're also surprisingly light because it's a spring roll!  The combination pho is more or less the \"kitchen sink\" of pho here because it has everything: rare eye round, brisket, flank, tendon, and even tripe. ( People who don't like tripe can exclude it from their order, or so I'm told. ) The cuts of meat are plentiful, too -- if you're a carnivore like I am, you'll love it. I always get extra ribeye because it's always good with the pho, but you can honestly have it as is and you'll be nice and full either way! The portions here are generous, so you never have to worry about leaving hungry.  The best part is the hours -- 9 AM to 6 AM each day. Even if you're up at almost midnight with the munchies, you can come here and be sated with whatever you order. Whether you're in Chinatown for business, or coming out of a drunken bender on the Strip at 3 AM, you can come here and be sure a nice hot meal is waiting for you!",

For the price, the pho had good texture, but within minutes the soup was already room temperature. However, it was pretty decked out with rare steak and meat balls. The banh xeo is probably the worse I have ever had. It tasted bland and the batter flavor was so strong that I thought I was eating pancakes, not a Vietnamese dish. My sister was very lucky. She ordered the bo nuong vi and the meat was so good. A perfect pairing with their huge batch of lettuce, pickled carrots and radishes.",

Okay, yes the quality and food portions are amazing,  hence the three stars instead of one.   After being out all night in vegas, I always order pho, and every time it's so bland. Pho is like every Asians hang over cure. Yes, there's a lot of meat and noodles,and that's the only good part.   Okay then finally the nail in the coffin! Every time, and I really mean every dang time! Their costumer service is so crappy, it ruins my day! The first time I went there last year) they didn't bring us any water until we pointed it out during our meal. The waiter was annoyed a nd irritated that we waved him down and shouted for him to come over and get us water. The second time I went (three days after the first visit) they literally forgot out kids food order TWICE!!!! Because our party was almost finished, We separated our meal and fed them, leaving us hungry and angry. This last visit today, had to wave the waiter down again for our order and we were done with our selection, our menus closed sitting in the center of our table, while he walked right past us to look at the tv.   So basically it's their damn customer service.   (The egg roll order is bomb! You get a huge plate full of veggies with them)",

The food was pretty good which is rare to find, so I applaud them for that and we were served fast. The portions of the meals were pretty big as well. I would've given this place another star to complete it as a 4 star but our server did not check on us not once after we were served. Other than that I found out this place is opened pretty late which is great also. Feel free to try this place out.",

Everything was perfect! I ordered the Large Pho with Brisket and Tendon with Eggroll. As i was mixing in my sauce, i see random strands of hair. I'm like \"ok. It can be mine\" but as i keep eating, I'm realizing the end of my hair is blue! So I'm looking carefully, the strands of hair isn't blue, it's dark brown/black. I'm looking in my tendon meat, it's legit stuck in the meat fat! How disgusting... I tried to get the servers attention but couldn't. Don't get me wrong, i love this place. The people in the back should wear a hair net if they already don't. Utterly disgusting!!!",

This place has none of those problems. You'll never see a bowl of Pho with oil floating on the top or being too salty.  You are able to build your own or order a specific item number. You are also able to choose what size bowl you prefer (Small or Large).  This establishment doesn't just offer the popular noodle soup. Their menu consists of appetizers and rice dishes too. They even offer Vietnamese-style BBQ, where you can cook meat and seafood on a tabletop grill.  My fam and I are regulars here. Service is always great and never had any complaints about this place. They get the 5-star rating for authenticity, quality, and cleanliness.",

Large, spacious and clean looking restaurant nestled in Chinatown of Vegas.   Liked the pho rib-eye and spring rolls.  Didn't really like the thai iced tea nor the vietnamese coffee w/ condensed milk, both of which were too sweet.   ++PROS++ + Clean, lighter color broth that is tasty and not too salty or packed with MSG + Rib-eye meat is very tender + Huge portions  --CONS-- - Pricey. $11.95 for rib-eye pho - Noodles are a bit too soft and clumped together - RIb-eye meat is also SUPER clumped together, had a rather annoying time unclumping my meal  OVERALL... Yes I would come back. Although on the pricey end, portions are generous and broth is pretty tasty. Also, when I asked for white onions on the side they really piled it on and didn't jip me. Yay for finding a yummy pho spot in Vegas! :)",

The only thing was they forgot a few things which was annoying.   Needless to say, people only ate half the food and was done. The pho was okay. I don't understand how they had such high ratings.",

Their banh xeo was crispy and delicious ! The bo nhung vi, and bo nhung vam is great ! Think of Korean bbq, but Vietnamese style either dry or soup based. Service is always pretty fast and friendly ! Everyone there is super nice ! Love it here!",

They bring your pho out with fixings (sprouts, limes, thai basil, etc) and have sauces (ex: sriracha) to mix into your broth as well. We have also ordered a vermicelli bowl (pork and egg roll) and we liked the flavoring/pork marinade. It was vermicelli, ya know?  Love the spring rolls with pork and shrimp (the pork can be a little chewy, but that's okay). The peanut sauce is simple and SO GOOD. I think that's what's great about Viet Noodle-- everything is simple and really delicious.",

I ordered pho with beef tendon and it was very good. The veggies and tendon were right for my taste. They were probably put into the bowl raw and the super hot broth just barely cooked them. The broth itself had very nice flavor. It's not the best I've ever had, but I was so hungry I almost finished it.   My boyfriend had the Vermicelli stir fried beef and he liked it. He asked for the bun with pork belly that was on the menu online but they didn't have it.  The sauce on the chicken wings were delicious. They also have a great selection of deserts. We had Thai tea and Banh Flan and they were tasty.  Overall, I highly recommend Viet Noodle Bar. The place is so clean and new, the service was quick and the prices, quality and portions are very reasonable.",

    "text": "With service that terrible, I'm not surprised that I got home with an incorrect order. But, let's rewind about twenty minutes.   Got a craving for some pho, and Viet has the best at this hour, but also wanted to get out of the house, so I decided to go in and eat. After being seated in one of the booths, the waiter comes up to take my order. I inquire as to what was in the combo pho (I'm not a fan of tripe) as it was one of the four ingredients (in addition to rare steak, tendon and flank), I ordered one without tripe and a side of ribeye. And here, ladies and gentlemen, is when I realize I had made a terrible mistake, as my waiter slams his hand on the menu and exclaims \"no\". This turns in to him angrily explaining that the ribeye is a side item. Repeatedly. Each time with me acknowledging this fact and still wanting it and each time he would tell me no. After 5 attempts at this, he finally got it. Or so I thought. Already severely irritated by this individual's behaviour, I asked him to make the order to go, because I did not want to interact with this person again, after he had ruined my simple excursion. After a few minutes, a gentleman brings out a big steaming bowl of pho and sets it on the table. I tell him this was to go. He pushes the bowl closer to me. I am losing the last vestiges of my temper as I reiterate that I wanted the food to go. Another member of the staff comes up and explains that the food runner did not understand English, so I explain again the issue. This employee then put in my to go order, which thankfully came out quickly - I paid and left as soon as I could. And upon getting home, poured a ribeye pho into my bowl. No rare steak. No flank. No tendon. Just the ribeye. Even though I got charged for both. I don't know what kind of business they're running here, but I will never go back in person; better to let Postmates deal with the idiocy - plus you get your money back when they completely mess up your order.",

I love when people interact with my kids in restaurants and they did the whole time we were there. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the broth wasn't quite as good as I had hoped. Added a little extra sriracha and hoisin sauce to give it the flavor it needed. The brisket and rare steak was fresh and tender as were the veggies. Would definitely return to this spot, but it's not quite as good as my other favorite spot in Chinatown.",

I have to commend the staff for coming around frequently and even the boss? Came by to check up on us. Restaurant was big and clean. I had rice with charred chicken and my husband had sry vermicelli with charred beef. Had summer roll for appetizer. The mint or lemongrass is somewhat overpowering.",

You grill them yourself and wrap them up in rice paper and assortment of veggies. They are very generous with the veggie portions. The pork chop is also very flavorful. What compliments the amazing food was the incredible service. I can't emphasize enough how impressed I am with such spectacular service! Great job to the hospitality team at the viet noodle bar!",

I had the large shrimp pho and my friend had the oxtail pho and let me tell you, it was amazing!

    "text": "We recently moved to Vegas and happily stumbled upon Viet Noodle Bar. Prior to moving here, we were avid visitors and we've tried several Vietnamese restaurants in the area. However, this place has now become our preferred Vietnamese spot. The quality of their food truly stands out from their competitors. Their pho broth is delicious and it does not require any additional hoisin and/or sirracha sauce. They also have Chao Ga (Vietnamese porridge) which is one of my favorite dishes. The Vietnamese restaurants in our old hometown don't offer this on their menus; therefore I was so happy to see this on their menu and I now order this regularly. The porridge is seasoned well; and it has just the right amount of ginger, garlic, rice, and meat. I've also tried their pork vermicelli and pork rice plates. The pork is charbroiled; tender; and very flavorful. The prices are reasonable and their portions are generous. The dining area is very spacious; we never have to wait to be seated. The women's bathroom is always clean which is a good sign in my opinion. I also like how their chopsticks are individually wrapped unlike other places where I always need to check the cleanliness of their utensils. However, the reason why I gave 5 stars is the outstanding service we always receive from their staff; they are all very courteous and attentive to our needs. Viet Noodle Bar is a prime example of what all restaurants should provide... excellent food quality with an exceptional customer experience!",

I don't know if this is a True Vietnamese place or not (i.e., where it's owned and cooked by a Vietnamese person), but the food was NASTY.  First of all, let me comment on the service.  I don't mind having my order taken by a non-Vietnamese dude, but at least the latter should know the menu.  I would say, I'd like #62 - Goi Ngo Sen Tom Thit, and he'd be like what?  I would have to physically point to that item on the menu.  I ask questions about the menu, he's clueless.  So now to the piece de resistance, the food.  First of all, I hate MSG (b/c of the potential health implications), I think it's a cop out and a cheap way to make \"savory\" food.  A True Viet would actually take the time to make the broth the old fashion way instead of sprinkling some magic powder.  The waiter's answer:  all Vietnamese food has MSG.  As a Vietnamese whose mama cooks everything from scratch, I took offense to it.  I lost my appetite with such stupid answer.  So I order the Goi, which was too sugary and gave me a stomach ache.  The first clue that this place is a crap hole is the fact that there aren't any Vietnamese in there.  Take the hint:  this place SUCKS!!!!",

The waitress instead offered us beef spring rolls and the special sauce which was so nice of her we really appreciate it.  I got shaking beef made with filet mignon which was exceptional, boyfriend got vermicelli with pork chops and fish cakes, was wonderful. Oh and the Thai ice tea was perfect.  Excellent authentic Vietnamese food and so  fresh.",

I like their vegetable Pho but my favorite is the Pho with Rare Steak, Flank, and Brisket.  I am not a huge fan of the super fatty meats so I ignore the tendon, tripe and fatty flank options.  Their pork chops are cooked in a sauce that is to die for.  They can be a little dry but taste fantastic.  They offer typical sauces on the table but it is the chili sauce not on the table which is more of a paste that you want to ask for.  Excellent!",

Not many places offers this options where you can make your own spring rolls or have the restaurant do it for you. We got there was no waiting at all and got seated right away. This restaurant is located off the strip and in the Chinatown area. It at the corner so you won't miss it. We ordered the grilled dishes of beef, shrimps and and squid so that we can make our spring rolls, engagement noodle with beef with leaf, and egg rolls. I ordered Thai tea for drink. The portions are larger and shareable with others. I liked all the dishes that come out. The food was delicious and tasty. The Thai tea drink was very good and flavorful. The services was excellent and friendly. They checked on us often and make sure that we are okay. The parking here is not bad at all since it in a plaza. I would go back here again if I'm in the area. I Highly recommend this place if you want good food and be off the strip if you don't want to be in a crowd.",

The waiters were all cool looking with their tattoos and man-buns (like me!) But that's as good as I am going to be.  Ok, I am about to go in.  First of, parking lot SUCKS.  No spots and there are multiple restaurants here and you can only fit 20 cars? Second, the place is TIGHT! You are back to back with people unless you are one of the cool young hip kids who gets a booth.  Third, slowest service ever.  A lot of the people in the party ordered Pho and they took 20 or so minutes to bring one bowl.  I know they have other customers but see I am now Yelping my ass off and I am keeping it real.  This place has the worst customer service.  And lastly and worst thing about this place, the waiters do not pay attention who ordered what.  He was even  getting overwhelmed when he asked \"is the check going to be split?\" People were giving him multiple answer and I can see him sweat.  His man bun was starting to get irritated it started moving.  I mean if you are getting a huge party HAVE A GAME PLAN to split it up with another waiter.  This one dude was overwhelmed and tried to play it cool.  When our party asked him questions he was impatient with his answers and even short with some people.  Don't be rude! People are paying for your salary so don't act like it's too much trouble to answer whats the difference between crispy noodle or soft noodle.  Anyway, again I am not going to be bias by this first experience.  But I will update my review once I visit again.  If you are coming here for a relaxing time - DON'T!.  If you are coming here for food and don't give two flying pigs if you get treated badly or not or wait for food for 3hrs then come.  The food is good.  But not worth the headache on a WEDNESDAY NIGHT! Are you serious guys!! hahaha I ordered lemongrass beef.  Everyone was ordering it on Yelp! It was good but they put a lot of \"lettuce\" on the bottom to make the dish fuller than what it is.  It was still good but I wanted Pho on this windy Vegas night.  The only thing that was warm on me was my face because I kept eating the Jalapeno and I kept putting hot sauce on my food.    Parking lot ALWAYS PACKED Restaurant Set-up TIGHTER THAN PANTS ON SOME DUDES IN THE STRIP LAYOUT Ok Restroom SUPER SMALL and SEMI CLEAN Tables were OILY Food was GOOD Service was BAD Response time for orders LONG  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage).  Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!",

    "text": "Ever since I was a kid, my impression of Las Vegas is only The Strip, and other areas outside of The Strip are desert with no people living in those areas. Until just recently, I discovered that areas outside The Strip actually have better food, that are cheaper and tastier. A couple months ago I had a week of business conference in Vegas and I tried so many different excellent restaurants outside of The Strip and one of them was Viet Noodle Bar.  So, when I visited Vegas again with my bf's family, I took them to Viet Noodle Bar for some hearty Asian soups and they all loved the food here.  We ordered 3 bowls of pho with brisket, 1 egg noodle with BBQ pork, and 1 order of the BBQ beef and shrimp (their specialty). Their pho bowls were amazing, really warmed our hearts and souls. I did5 get to try the egg noodle, but it looked really tasty. I was so busy cooking the beef and shrimp on the griller to make our own spring rolls. It was a fun experience to craft your own spring rolls, putting as many pickles as I wanted.   I really recommend ordering the BBQ beef and shrimp, grilled by yourself. And also some pho bowls to wash away the sinfulness of Vegas.",

I arrived before the lunch rush and was able to secure booth seating. They can accommodate large groups no problem here. Our server was very friendly and all the staff was helping each other out enhancing the dining experience. Even the owner came out and talked with us briefly. Nice find and I'm happy my friend recommended this spot.   I obviously ordered pho. It was actually a hard decision when I made my order because I couldn't decide between the Rib Eye Pho and the Combination Pho. My friend suggested that I get the Combination Pho and get a side of the Rib Eye meat. Great suggestion and I ended up getting that. We also ordered a Thit Nuong Cuon Roll.   The bowl of pho came out piping hot and the soup was delicious! Noodles were prepared well and there was lots of meat in the bowl. The side of Rib Eye Steak was very generous with lots of raw onion over it. Surprising me was their Thit Nuong Cuon roll. It was great with all the flavors and textures in the roll.   This became my go to spot for pho in Vegas!",

Not only does Viet Noodle offer Vegetarian Spring Rolls but they are absolutely delicious. Warm and freshly made to order perfect ratio every bite is like a salad.... That you must dip into the peanut sauce!!!! They have a few other items on their veggie friendly menu I have tried but I always opt for the Springs Rolls and Pho. My only wish is that they would brighten up the veggie selection in their pho.... I have come back time and time again hoping it would change or become more authentic but we aren't there yet. It's okay the SR's keep me coming back!   To top off that note I have also eaten here with meat eaters and they have enjoyed the food! So all in all I can say this place satisfies everyone's taste preference.....",

That's right, I had the combo pho which came up to be $10 but it was worth it even for a small had plentiful noodles and a large handful of meats and veggies. The pho flavor was exactly what it should be, had tons flavor, we also ordered the calamari which reminded me on onion ring, nice crunchy outside and fresh meaty inside. Worth the order. Egg rolls come out on a plate with lettuce which I'm gonna assume the locals eat along with the egg rolls because they're super meaty. I def would go back, spent less then $30 on a table for 2 compared to spending $30 on one person on the strip. I would recommend this place to everyone, they deserve the great review, food was good, wish I had taken pictures!.",

We went in, and the place was packed.  We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.  The smell from inside smelled so good, like Korean BBQ.  I ordered Banh Canh Tom (Shrimp Udon Noodle).  The broth was a bit bland and it only came with 3 pieces of small shrimps.  It also came with the usual veggies that come with Pho.  The food itself was okay.  My favorite was probably the egg roll with the lettuce and daikon/carrot mix.   I must've ordered the wrong item. I looked at other tables and looked like they were cooking things like Korean BBQ style... that must be their popular item.",

The wait time was short and we were seated promptly. The menu was easy to read and we found what we wanted quite easily. We both noticed that they have more than one type of egg roll(vegetable, pork, shrimp) which was nice as other restaurants have the selection of just egg or spring roll. Their pho no matter the type comes in Small or Large and that was new to us as well as other restaurants just offer one size.   I opted for a large combination pho and my friend had the same in a size small and we also ordered pork egg rolls. I loved that they brought out our own separate plate full of the toppings; bean sprouts, mint and jalapenos. Not that it's a problem to share but it's nice having our own to take from. The flavor in the egg rolls and pho were very delicious. I actually should've gotten a small as the large was too much for just myself but my friend ate all hers.   We'll definitely come back here when we're craving more pho!",

Upon returning and noticing it was named something else and new staff, I was a bit hesitant thinking the standards and my hopes wouldn't be met let alone exceeded. However, it's even better!  I usually get the small combination pho for under $9 and, trust me, it's delicious and more than enough.  They meat is proportional to the bowl size and the broth on it's own (w/o adding anything) is tasty and is not sweet like I've tried at other pho joints, and the noodles are cooked right.  I have also tried their chicken wings and they are so good! So don't be afraid to explore. You'll be pleasantly surprised.   Beware: you must spend at least $15 to use your credit/debit card.    Service is great and speedy. The place is beautiful and clean. Plenty of space.   This is my favorite pho place to go and don't mind making the drive to Chinatown for it.",

    "text": "Came in with a party of 12, called ahead to let them know we were coming. Once we arrived we were seated immediately!  We were given the menu and was not rushed to give our orders.   A lot of us ordered pho of course, from combo to selecting our own choices of meat etc. --the broth was good, they give you enough meat, tendon etc for you to eat the entire bowl with the noodles. That is always a plus. Also, when taking our order, we were asked if we'd like the cilantro and onions or not. That was nice.  Also ordered appetizers-- spring roll & egg roll (4 decent sized) comes with of course the lettuce, mint, cucumber, thinly sliced pickled carrots and radish w/ dipping sauce.   In addition to that, some of us also got the vermicelli with egg roll and pork, and the sugar cane shrimp with egg roll- they seemed to enjoy it since the entire bowl was eaten.  Also got the Che Ba Mau- Tri colored dessert- perfect to top off dinner. Not too sweet, mix everything and give it a bite. Tasty.   Let me tell you about service, Hoang (forgive me for spelling if incorrect) was our server. He's very delightful, patient and knows how to provide over the top customer service. His smile is contagious and we will come back to see him again! He's very respectful and that's what will keep us coming back.   I need to remember to take pictures of my food but I'm sure you'll be able to find pictures of what we ordered posted here already!",

After he came back with our drinks he left and didn't ask if we were ready to order. Then after the constant stare of looking over at the waiters one finally came over and took our order. We ordered the pho and it tasted okay. I wish it had more flavor to it. Waiting 15 mins for a waiter to come back to us and eating the food. I say that it was not worth coming back. Maybe in the future it will be better. I hope.",

At that hour there's never a wait to be seated, and our food comes considerably fast every time. The restaurant is open until 6am, but the kitchen does close at 5:30. This my fourth time here and I have left satisfied every single time. Today I ordered the ox tail pho, egg rolls, and spring rolls with charbroiled pork.  The ox tail pho only comes in one size, a large, and it's huge! I wish there was an option to order a small because I am never able to finish it all.   The egg rolls are served extremely hot each time. They come in an order of 4. They're fresh, and exceptionally crispy. Wrap with the accompanied veggies and dip them in fish sauce! Yummm!  The spring rolls are good. They too come 4 to an order. They are light, and the pork is full of flavor.",

There was cute decor inside, there was a classic but modern vibe.  We ordered a combination pho each per person - I thought the portion size was huge and it wasn't expensive. They gave a good amount of meat and noodles. The broth was decent, not too bad. We also ordered shrimp spring rolls but after we almost finished our pho, it never showed up. We asked our waiter and it looked like the kitchen had forgotten about it until later on so we asked to just cancel the order. Towards the end, they brought us the shrimp spring rolls anyways (for free, on the house) because said that the kitchen was already working on it by the time we realized. That was really nice of them, they didn't have to because we weren't upset - so full from the pho already.   The service was pretty good besides the forgotten order - they filled up our water very often and checked up on us.",

Located in a strip mall across from Southwest Gas. Pretty good size menu and carries a variety of your standard Vietnamese fare. It's always full but there is still room to get around and I like that the tables and chairs are not squeezed together where you find it difficult to get up. Sometimes it's a little hard to get someones attention and you kind of feel ignored a lot. I know it might seem rude to say that I don't expect much out of Asian service, but I don't. The service here is typical of most Asian restaurants. I come here for the food and it's always pretty good. The parking is easy. The prices are reasonable.",

I would totally recommend this place. There's ample of parking, and they open pretty late, so that's cool. They also serve alcohol here, so you can wash it all down with some beer (or shots).",

I enjoy walking in without having to worry about a seat. The staff greets you once in enter and escorts you to a seat of your choice (depending on how busy they are)  I love ordering their pho where you can choose your own meat. I usually add brisket, flank and rare steak in my pho and it tastes delicious! You also have a size option on how big you want your bowl. To me the small size is satisfying for its portion. Sometimes I order their egg rolls and it comes with lettuce and other good greens.   There were times where they didn't have brisket whenever I order a pho soup that comes with it. Lately, I think their brisket stock is back and I'm glad I don't have to worry about not eating brisket lol. Nevertheless, I'm usually a returning customer because of their excellent service and high quality meals :)",

I'm not a Vegas residence but this is the first Vietnamese restaurant I have visited and eaten at, and never again!   Since they do not have competition with other Vietnamese restaurants or a large Vietnamese community here (not in comparison to Orange County, California) they completely skyrocketed their prices on a simple dish and the food lacks any flavor of delicious Vietnamese Cooking.   The price is not mediocre. It is almost $9 for a small bowl of Pho. I mean just wow! Definitely not the prices that I am used to of average ($6.50-$7.00 for a small)  Their menu is a large menu filled with the advertisement if it could be condensed it would be about 3 pages.   Food: I had the Banh Canh, it had a good portion of meat in there. But it was so plain. It had no flavoring whatsoever. Just Banh Canh, and pieces of meat that are not even flavored.   My BF had the rice dish. Just regular rice, they don't have broken rice here. TBH, even if they do have broken rice, the demographics who dines here won't even recognize the difference between broken and regular rice. I tasted the piece of chicken that my BF ordered, and it was yummy. But again, price does not just because of a small portion. It didn't come with a side soup when it should have.   Restroom: it is not too bad or dirty, it is in the back.   Parking: is a shared plaza with other restaurants. I have not been here during the daytime or peak hours to know when there is no parking or not.   Service: Nice waiters and waitress. They have an appropriate amount of employees when it is not too busy. So we did not have a hard time flagging them down.   Overall, this place thrives I am sure because it is open late at night. Most places should open late night so people can have more options. If you are visiting this area of Chinatown in the daytime, I would not visit this restaurant.",

The pho with rib eye is spot on and is packed with flavor. The portions are generous and the price is reasonable.   There are a few quirks to this place like full blown ads in the center of the menu and elevated booths but it only adds to the restaurant's character.   Parking is a hit or miss given how busy the plaza gets and how small the parking lot is in comparison... but that's most of spring mountain anyways.  Do yourself a favor and try this place out! You won't be disappointed...",

Our server Hoang was very attentive, personable, and thorough. I've never been to a pho place that asked about peanut allergies and having veggies added to the broth.   Food: Portion sizes were big! I got #30 vermicelli with eggs rolls and charbroiled pork. It came out very quick, meat was nice and tender, egg rolls were huge. I was able to try my nieces pho broth prior to her adding any spices and it was delicious. The rest of the party seemed to enjoy there food as well. No complaints here!",

It's not that they're rude but it's the lack of attention they pay. We ordered a rice dish and a pho and the pho got mixed up with the table next to us. We could tell it was switched before the staff picked it up. No apology yet, only asked us twice what we ordered (you should know that). We finally get the pho 20 minutes later after we share the rice dish and then there's a sorry.  Also we finished our waters a long time ago and they remained empty the whole time, they didn't offer us more water. Previous times to today though, a different waiter didn't write down our order and had to come back to ask me 3 times what I ordered. Maybe you should think to write it down at some point????   Anyway, like I said the food quality/taste is great but service really needs to upgrade.  Pay attention to your paying customers and work on having them leave happy!",

I also really love their Thai tea because you get a lot for a good price. It's also super creamy and just the right amount of sweetness.   Service is spotty because they'll be quick to seat and take your order but once your meal comes, nobody really comes back to check on you until your almost done with your food. However, if you need something, just call them right over and they'll help you right away.   They get super busy at night compared to the day, especially with the grills they have so if you wanna avoid all the smell of smoke and BBQ then just come during the day.   Can't wait to come back again next time to try out the BBQ with a group of friends.",

We always go to Kim Long, but after reading reviews I had to come here and we came 3 days out of the 4 days of being here and everyone in the family loved it. The oxtail pho was very good and the broth could've had a little more flavor. Had the Com Ga Roti and the Hen was soooooooo good. The hen was cooked perfectly with super crispy skin and the inside wasn't dry at all. Next day had Com Suong Bo Dai Han and the marinade was perfect and perfect with just white rice and an egg and some fish sauce on the side. We then got to meet the owner who let us know about District One and Pho So 1 and that he's the owner of all 3. Will definitely go check out his other places. Overall everything everyone had was really good and this will be a go to place for our family when we're in Vegas",

We also ordered pork chops and short ribs with rice as well as the pho oil. The ox tail soup was amazing especially with the pho oil.

The pho broth was a little bland, but doctored up with some chili paste and hoisin sauce and mint/jalapeno/basil... it improved the taste.  Place seemed clean...except when I took a quick peek under the table before I slid into the booth seat, it looked like several days worth of food bits and crumbs were under there. But oh well, it's not like you're eating off of the floor.  Service was friendly, but not overly attentive. Our server didn't bring our check, or was able to be flagged down to ask for it, so had to pay at the register.  Felt a bit like being in the twilight zone. Why? Because there was one melodramatic song that was being looped over and over again the entire time we dined. Surprised none of the employees get sick of that song. All that while ESPN was being broadcast on the TVs.  Like the early and late hours...great for when you're craving Vietnamese for breakfast or for a late dinner.  Will try the oxtail pho next time and see if it's reason enough to keep coming back. But this first visit, nothing that really stood out to warrant coming back here soon.",

    "text": "I don't like writing negative comments but I just had to share our experience here. The place looks great, it wasn't busy, the place was half full and we got seated right away. We had a party of 9 people and the server approached our group. He took orders from one side of the table and did not come back for a little while. It's 3am and we're all hungry, so my friend waved at the closest server to order food. One person ordered a chicken wrap from the first server, and because the server never took order from the other half of the party, another person ordered a beef wrap from a different server. Apparently, because we ordered from a different server for a beef wrap, it supposedly cancelled out the chicken wrap that was ordered from the original server. The first server briefly confronted the other server in front of our table and said that stupid excuse as to why the order was mixed up and cancelled, making it look like as if it was our fault because we ordered from a different server. That is unacceptable because he never took the order for half of our party and didnt come back so we were forced to ask another server to get our order. Also, that is something you just fix, and not come up with some bullshit excuse in front of your guest. Go to the back and talk with your coworker and sort it out. Very unprofessional. As a matter of fact, I sat all this time to write this review while waiting for someone to ask me for my order, let alone if I want some water, yet no one even approached me. So I had ample time to write all of this and let everyone know how bad their service is in this place. Keep in mind that the restaurant is NOT even busy. If you don't want to risk getting blamed for getting your order mixed up, hearing excuses instead of just fixing it, or having half your party waiting to get their order taken care of while the other half eats their food, stay away from this place.",

I ordered a plain noodle soup pho for my husband and a beef and egg roll dry noodle mix (sorry, I forgot the name so please refer to the photo attached).  I called my order in to allow ample time for them to make it while I hustled to get there from Tahiti village. I had to wait another 10mins after I arrived but I didn't mind getting fresh food. One of the waiters even poured me a glass of iced water while I wait and apologized for the delay.  The restaurant was pretty packed during the time I visited and everyone seemed very happy eating their food.   The restaurant was very clean and all the waiters provided very good refill service and table wipe down after the customers left. When my food was ready to go, the waiter hand delivered it to where I was sitting (such great service).  To-go packing was very safe even though I had to drive a distance back. All the add ins for the pho was fresh and palatable. My beef and egg roll noodle mix was so freaking delicious, it was crazy. Flavorful and fresh. If you're craving some good Vietnamese food in vegas, look no further. This is the place to go.",

We did get seated immediately on a Saturday lunch rush, which is the one good thing about this place.  The menu seems to be on the overpriced side. The food weren't even that great so I'm shocked they are charging this much, with so many other competitors located nearby.  I got the spring roll and I was not a fan of the sauce that came with it. It was a peanut sauce but it had a funky taste. I like the generic sweetened fish sauce that comes with it. I also decided to get the Com Suong, the pork chop was dried but had a good flavor. The veggies were limited with it. The portion was good but I wished they focused more on the quality side.   I also had a few sips from my friend's bowl of pho. The broth was ok, it was on the blander side of things.  Overall, I wouldn't come back since there are so many other options around the area.",

    "text": "My gf and I came in last weekend and ordered two Bun Bo Hue since most reviews on Yelp suggested this is one of their signature dishes. As someone who was born and grew up in Saigon for 25 years, I would say it was below my expectation for \"authentic\" Vietnamese food. The lack of shrimp paste (or mam ruoc) made the broth not as tasty as I expected, but it's understandable since there are Non-Vietnamese customers and they might not like the smell. But the broth was also lack of chili paste or sate. The flavor of fried lemongrass and red pepper is what really make Bun Bo Hue stand out from other kind of noodles. The missing key ingredients above really killed the authenticity of the dish. I would give it 3/5 stars for the food. The one star rating actually comes from the fact that when I was washing my hands in the restroom after the meal, one of their employees working in the kitchen walked in the bathroom stall to pee, flushed the toilet with his hand and proceeded to put that very hand in the faucet water for ONE second, WITHOUT washing it properly with soap, then walked back out. It made me wonder the sanitary condition of the food I just ate! The owner should take this matter seriously before somebody get food poison",

So the morning after while all my friends were dead..... asleep HAHA couple of my friends and I decided to go eat some delicious pho while the other enjoy their rest in the dungeon... (what it looked like in our hotel rooms)   I really wanted oxtail pho, this place and pho 87 were the top two choices but decided to give this place a try.   The place was very spacious and it wasn't too crowded and it looked as though a lot of locals were dining there. SCORE! haha   I immediately ordered a young coconut to cure my hangover.... you have to scoop the meat and eat the meat with the coconut water and it'll work wonders trust me.   We ordered the beef spring roll. How do they make their beef so soft? SO DELICIOUS  The shrimp eggroll DO NOT PASS order it...take a dying friend if you have to you must get it!   I ordered my favorite ox tail pho and it was BOMB. But .... it's really hard to eat an it's hot... so just watch your fingers haha   My friend ordered the bun bo hue .... WOW!! The soup is a bit thicker than the usual bunbo I get but they sure know how to make their bun bo! I said can she get a \"BUN BO HUE\" and he gave a look and smirked and said \"you mean beuon bo hueeee...\" yes, sorry I'm sorry jeez. -___- haha  The place is really clean and the air condition is on point HAHAHAH if you want to explore a bit out of the strip come for the pho here .... if you're REALLY hungover but really want pho just go to treasure island... their pho is decent too and they have room service pho AHHAA",

Now let me warn you, their banh xeo is HUGE...big enough that you can share with another person. So you can imagine the waiter's reaction when each of my boys order their own.  Yea my boys sure can eat :) Their Vietnamese crepe is perfectly crisp and they're not stingy with the veggies. They give you plenty of lettuce, basil, mint, etc with your meal. Another warning - they do take their time preparing this so be ready to wait awhile for your dish.  This was probably the only downfall especially when their order came out after the husband and I were almost done with our pho. The cook knew this too and apologized profusely that it took so long, which was really nice of him.   Overall, this place is good. The restaurant is pretty big with a good amount of tables and chairs. Both times we went it was pretty busy.  Although it was busy, we were seated fairly quickly. The husband especially likes this spot cause of their oxtail pho. Not only that but I believe the manager or owner even came out and greeted us personally and thanked the husband for his service which he greatly appreciated.  They also offer military discount, which is another plus!",

    "text": "It was a brisk December night, and we were in the mood for oxtail soup. We turned to good ol' Yelp for directions and this place had multiple reviews for oxtail pho... and they were also open late, very late.  So after our tour of the Neon Museum, we made our way to this non descript strip mall.  Lucky for us, Stephen's mom has a disabled plaque, and we grabbed the last parking spot in the lot.    The restaurant is the first one nearest the street, and it's a fairly large place.  We still had to put our name down and wait inside the very cramped lobby.  The wait took about 10 minutes and like any other Vietnamese noodle place, the waiter comes by almost immediately to take your order.  We ordered 2 oxtail pho, and since Stephen's mom doesn't eat much I got her a tiny side bowl of the pho and I was going to give her 1/2 of my oxtail.  I guess I am spoiled by living in Orange County, the 2nd largest population of Vietnamese outside Saigon.  The oxtail pho here was good, but not great.  The oxtail was chewy and did not fall off the bone.  I actually gnawed on it like a little puppy.  Not pretty.  The flavor was ok, but what offset that was the super generous portion of noodles they gave.  I also ordered the chicken wings which had a nice kick to it and went great with the pho.  Overall its a good place if you want a bowl of pho, and a place that's stays open until 6 am... yes, 6 am (they open at 9 am).  4 generous stars but really its more 3 1/2",

The Vietnamese fried spring rolls are delicious. There's really nothing here I don't like, honestly.  Love the Vietnamese iced coffee. You can get it hot or cold; with it without condensed milk.

The staff is friendly and very quick in getting things for you as well as getting tables cleaned. I seriously love the fact that they are open SO LATE. I can come here to eat after work and not have to deal with the hassle of a long wait like pho kim long that caters to all the tourists.   The pho BROTH is on POINT for me here. It tastes like the closest flavor to what my Vietnamese AUNTY used to make for me when I was younger. Their egg rolls are also HUGE compared to what I am used too so my husband definitely loves this place as well as he critique based off of the egg rolls hahahaha.",

We ordered the chicken pho, pho with meatballs and rare beef, mi bo kho, and the beef spring rolls.   The beef springs rolls had the charbroiled taste straight from the grill. There was a healthy serving of beef in each piece. The fish sauce dipping sauce was the perfect match with the spring rolls. The broth on each of the pho's were so flavorful and comforting. Perfect for the cold evening. The Mi Bo Kho broth was rich and flavorful with a depth to it that's hard to describe. The chunks of beef were super tender but a little fatty. The noodles in all of the soups were just right when it was served to us.   Staff was attentive at the right times and service was quick. The menu is pretty large and there are lots of items I want to go back to try.",

It comes with a surprisingly substantial amount of oxtail in the soup. Be warned, you need to use your hands to really get into the oxtail bone for the best bits of the meat. My favorite part of any soup is the broth, and the oxtail broth has two thumbs up from me!  What I enjoy about Viet Noodle Bar is that not only is their oxtail pho very tasty, but their other entrees and appetizers are also great for sharing with a group. My favorite was their Fried Crispy Rice Noodle dish. You have the option of beef or seafood. The crispy noodle is at the base and drenched in sauce with a pile of stir-fried vegetables and meat.  Other than the food, their staff has always been friendly and kind to my group and me.",

Their Banh Xeo was better than most I've tried, but their grill meat was so-so. The rice dish was OK as I was expecting an authentic place like this to use broken rice. The marinated meat was OK but have just enough taste to remind you it's Vietnamese style.",

We had pho (beef broth with beef flank rare steak) and it cooks with the heat of the soup, and it was quite fresh and delicious.  I also had the iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk and it's served in a small amount, but trust me that it's all you need because it's super strong!

I went there for dinner yesterday with family and I was so disappointed.  Not with the food nor the service by our server but with other servers and workers.  I originally thought our server Quan was the only one working.  He was doing the best he could greeting customers, taking their orders, delivering food, refilling their drinks, checking up on them and getting their checks.  We were being patient because I thought he was the only one working and thought that they were short staffed.  I had to admit, Quan actually did pretty well considering.  So we were patient with him only to find out that there were other workers!  One was standing behind our table watching tv that was in-front of us, about three were sitting down at a table talking!!!! I was shocked that they were taking advantage of Quan working hard. They were making him do all the work! I hope the owner sees whom his valuable workers are and the lazy ones.  It's going to hurt his business in the long run.  I have to say that this is the first time I couldn't give good rating although the food and the service was great (by only Quan).  I would definitely will not return if this is not corrected because it affects my dining experience.   I cant stand to see people being treated unfairly.  It's bullying at work!",

I knocked a star off because I called prior to coming and the lady on the phone told me there was no wait so I was at the restaurant within 10 minutes. When we arrived at the restaurant, it was packed and we had to wait about 10 minutes. I understand that's not long but when I asked the guy who seemed like he was in charge, he brushed me off saying \"he doesn't know if people lie about that\". Usually that puts me off a restaurant but it was New Year's Day and I already tried 2 prior restaurants and they were both closed.  I'm glad I gave it a chance. The food was very good! The restaurant was clean. Service was quick. I deviated from my usual pho and got a vermicelli bowl with grilled chicken and egg roll and the boyfriend got the pho with rib eye.

It's served hot and full of the intense meat flavors with a slight kick. They have a lot of different options on their menu including different desserts which I like! My family ordered other food such as the charbroiled pork and rice dish and the filet mignon and rice dish. I tried both and they were also delicious.   Overall I rate this place 4 stars! I left one star out because their service could be better. No one came to check up on us awhile after our food was served and we waited a long while to receive our check. The ambience of this place is very casual, pretty clean and the food is great quality! Not like a lot of other Pho places out here. I will definitely come back though, especially because I can't find a better Bun Bo Hue anywhere else!",

This place was pretty big and clean which was nice. The service was pretty fast and decent.   I ordered the Bun Bo Hue, spring rolls, egg rolls and boyfriend ordered pho tai. The eggs were good! It was crispy and didn't feel like they been refried a million times.   Spring roll were only okay. The lettuce felt a little old and the pork was a little tough. The bun bo hue was pretty good! It could of had a tad more flavor in the broth but other than that I enjoyed it. The bowls were huge, which is a plus cause I can consume a lot of noodles!",

Because I read awesome reviews about this place, from their pho to the Bun Bo Hue.  The restaurant was a decent size.  We were helped right away.  I ordered the Bun Bo Hue while my friends ordered pho.  My bun bo hue was good.  I love bun bo hue and I usually enjoy it at Pho Saigon 8.  But, Viet Noodle Bar was comparable.  The friend that likes pho prefers the Pho Saigon 8's better.  The other friend liked it equally.    The bowl is a big size so I packed half of my food to go.  Staff was very friendly and attentive.  Oh, and they served filtered water.  Yay!",

I've never had Vietnamese food, and because of this experience, I plan to search for one in our hometown. The food was the best experience we had in Las Vegas (believe it or not). Although I have not had other entrees, I assume the other food will be as prepared nicely and tasty as were today. The food was Great! Tasty! Well prepared! If I ever come back to Vegas, I'll be back!  Did I mention the service was Great! BTW the 2016 Olympics were on the TV and the servers were rooting Team USA!",

    "text": "Oh my god! What is pho kim long or pho so 1 after having this place? There are so many reasons why I love this place so much more. First, it closes pretty late at 2AM. Second, it's not as crazy and disorganized as other pho places. Third, the broth is so much better and so delicious! Lastly, SERVICE was seriously on point. Upon entering, you can see the lovely design of the restaurant and how spacious/open it is. You're immediately greeted by staff and they are very patient with you when you're completely indecisive like me! Haha. Plus they check up on you frequently and they are open to questions as well.   What we ordered? The buttery garlic wings! Contains six pieces and it was super crunchy and cooked to perfection. Good amount of butter and garlic. The taste of the garlic wasn't too strong at all.   The famous oxtail pho everyone is talking about is another dish we ordered and let me tell you, the bowls were freaking huge! You seriously can share with someone. The broth was to die for and the oxtail, super tender and very easy to eat. There was so much oxtail! If I could describe the portion of the oxtail, put your two fists together.   Bun bo hue was the dish I ordered. Oh my god. I've never been so excited to talk about this dish until now. The broth was super delicious especially with lime squeezed all over it with chili. The tendons, the pork belly, the beef, and the meatballs made me so much better. So much meat in one bowl. Our server saw my face and he told me the guy at the other table had the same reaction lol.   Pork chop with rice was ordered by my friend. Pork chop was huge and very savory and soft to eat. Definitely cooked to perfection. The rice and egg made it better along with the fish sauce provided.   The lemon grass beef on the side was super good as well. Full of flavor. We ordered it as a side and it's such a deal because they give you so much.   Keep in mind also that when you order rice dishes, you can add three meats for a reasonable price even with soups which makes me happy. I hate sticking to just one choice of meat.  Will I be back? Hell yes! This place is definitely a five star for me. I love how the restaurant set up is, it's not disorganized, and the service is outstanding compared to other pho restaurants. The food was phenomenal as well. I completely loved every bite of it. Reason why I give it a 5 is because I've never had such great food and service at a pho restaurant in Las Vegas before. Thank you for the first wonderful experience. I will be back and will recommend this place to my friends.",

Though I am not sure how authentic the dishes are I know they are really good and my taste buds just love them! You can taste the herbs and spices and the servers are also pleasant. Just ask nicely like you are supposed to and they can for example, give you that extra cilantro and sprouts that you like.   I just gave out a 3-star rating coz yesterday when we dined here it was really warm to kinda hot. Their a/c wasn't working well. It could have been better if they could put a sign or warning outside so at least customers would be informed and it will be better if they fix it right away. It is summer so it will really be appreciated if it is cool inside.",

Would get again!   Also got fried egg rolls, it was obviously fried after I ordered it, since it came after my udon noodle soup and it was still hot (not warm mind you) when I ate it , after polishing off my noodle soup. Only downfall was the pickled radish and carrot side - utterly disgusting. Was not fresh, not crisp and not a refreshing balance to the fried egg roll.",

The Goi Cuon, spring rolls with shrimp and pork, are a tasty appetizer, as well, so pair those with your entree and you're on your way to a fabulous meal.

This establishment comes from the same family that brings us Pho So 1 and District One Kitchen, but this particular one is our favorite.   I usually order the Bun Bo Hue (Hue Style Noodle Soup), although the Little Guy always get my portion of the pig's blood cubes (sadly).  The Little Guy and Little Gal always get a side order of egg noodles in chicken broth.  Sometimes, they want a little more which is fine with us.  The Husband usually gets the Pho Dac Biet (Combination Pho) or maybe the Pork Chop with rice. Sometimes we add the Cha Gio (Egg Rolls with Pork and Vegetables) too.  One of my favorite things to order from here is the Bo Nuong Vi (Beef BBQ) or Nhung Dam (Vinegar Hotpot). It's a bit time-consuming, which doesn't always work out when we have the kids with us.  But when it's just the two of us, we like to take over the table and cook our own food and wrap it up in yummy goodness.  I just love eating this, as do many others since you'll see many customers cooking up their protein and wrapping it up.  Viet Noodle Bar is a popular place and for the most part, the wait isn't too long.  They have large tables for large parties, but I would recommend calling ahead if you have a big group planned.",

Including pho Kim long, Nem nuong bistro, pho so 1, pho bosa, pho kinh do, pho Saigon 8 and other viet places I don't remember, this is by far my favorite one!!  I love their pho!  The broth has the richest, best flavor. It's not just salty... You can taste the sweetness from the beef bones too. They are also super generous wth their portions. I think this is the only pho place where I can't really finish an entire bowl. Their meat is tender and juicy as well. I've also tried their wrap your own spring rolls with the thin vermicelli grilled pork and shrimp. It was delicious!    All and all you should try this place out. Service is good.

    "text": "This is my first time here and I was impressed just because for a pho place , it was really clean and well put together. Pho was good & above average. I would describe their broth as a clean , lighter color broth that is not too oily or too salty or packed with msg. I had their small pho ga (pho w/ chicken). I usually order pho tai bo vien (pho w/ rare steak and meatballs) at Viet restaurants when I want soup. There was no option to have half rare steak and half meatballs.  It's 7.95$ for a small bowl (or 8.95$ for large) w/ one choice of meat then add-on 1.50$ extra for meatballs. Although it's on the pricey end (or maybe I'm just used to the 6 or 7$ large bowls back in Cali) , my small bowl was enough to be filling. Ample amount of noodles plus they're not too stingy on the meat either. I prefer the food here over Pho Kim Long or Jenni Pho.",

    "text": "I have to preface this review by saying that I am normally not a huge fan of Vietnamese food, but the BF is, so whenever I want to score some GF brownie points, I will (reluctantly) suggest that we go to a Vietnamese place.  That was the case when we were searching for a lunch place in Vegas, I've decided that we needed to find a Vietnamese place so that the BF can fulfill his Pho craving. I came across this place after a brief search on Yelp, and I am so glad that my fellow Yelpers have once again steered me to the right direction!    Here are the dishes we tried (ranked by favorites): Tom Hoa Tien (Shrimp Egg Rolls) - the dish is simply shrimps wrapped with spring roll skin and deep fried, but it was oh sooo good! The crunchiness of the spring roll skin coupled with the juicy flavorful shrimps were a match made in heaven. I could eat a whole tub of this!  Banh Xeo (Vietnamese Crepe) - this was the first time I've ever tried Vietnamese crepe and I don't know why it took me so long to try this dish. I wish I took a better picture that truly reflect how big this dish was. The crepe was practically the size of head and filled with shrimp, ground pork and bean sprouts. You are suppose to eat it with lettuce, basil and pickled vegetables, as well as the dipping sauce (Nuoc Cham).  It is actually a pretty involved process to just eat this dish, but it's oh so worth it!  Ever since then, I have always look for this dish whenever I am in a Vietnamese restaurant, but no one has done it as well as this restaurant   Pho Duoi Bo (Oxtail Pho) with a side of Tripe - I love oxtail and have rarely seen them featured in Pho. I really liked the way the oxtail was cooked here. I also ordered a side of tripe with the pho, it came in a soup, which was kind of weird, but it tasted good and that was all it mattered.   Pho Bo - just your standard pho, not much to report on this dish.   Overall, I loved nearly all of the dishes we tried here! It might even turn me into a fan of Vietnamese food, or just a fan of this restaurant :)",

    "text": "Haven't been here ever since it was Pho Hung, but after a few visits, Viet Noodle Bar has won me over! Going with a group is a great way to explore many menu items without filling up on just a couple of items.   Believe it or not, they make a solid Chicken Pho here for those of you who aren't fond of Oxtail, tendon, and other mystery meats in your pho. We also got to try each of their grilled spring rolls which were okay, we also tried a mix grill assortment which was fun, but could be a little awkward from where you're situated and even dangerous with hot splattering oil when excess liquid from raw meat or seafood comes in contact with the oil. BE CAREFUL!!!  The Lotus Salad and the Banh Xeo(Vietnamese Crepe) were other very delicious options we got to try. Service was spotty on our first visit, but we had a much better waiter on our second visit(Tallest Asian waiter, glasses, and speaks perfect English) On another visit, I ordered the Bo Luc Lac(Shaking Beef) with Red Rice and that was pretty good and a generous portion as well. On the menu, the dessert selections look slim, but our waiter was nice to point out other dessert items up front by the cash register. The Vietnamese Coffee Float(I call it Vietnamese Affogato ;0) is a great way to end your meal, and be on the lookout for the expansion of their dessert items in the future! ALOHA!!!  DO IT!!!: Chicken Pho Bo Luc Lac Lotus Salad Banh Xeo Vietnamese Coffee Float  Shaka Meter: \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  4",

We just wanted some vietnamese food and this place was one of the high rankers on Yelp, but I honestly don't know how this place got such high reviews.. I was a tad bit disappointed...it definitely did not meet my 4/5 standard. But then again, I grew up eating authentic Vietnamese food all my life so my taste palette for Vietnamese food is much more demanding than the average person. It was just OK for me. But don't get me wrong, I can see how it may be good for other people, so don't let this review defer you from checking them out. I'm giving this place 3 stars because of their lack of authenticity. But that's just my own personal and critical 2 cents.   Don't come if you truly want authentic Vietnamese food, but come if you want food in your belly and get seated right away with a larger party because it's a spacious/clean restaurant.",

I was here Tuesday (7/25). As soon as I got in we got seated right away. We were sitting at our table for a good 15min and no one came to take our order yet. It was only 3/4pm. So it was after lunch and a little too early for dinner. They weren't busy at all. As far as I remember, there was only 5 other tables that were full. When they finally took our order, it didn't take too long for our food to come to us (+1 star) the food is great here actually. I got the combination pho, charbroiled pork rice plate & egg rolls. Everything was delicious! While I eat I tend to drink a lot of water. My cup was already empty. What I usually like to do is l leave my cup at the end of the table so they could see that I needed a refill of water. My boyfriends cup & mines were at the end of the table. An employee walked passed us looked at our table and didn't bother to refill it. No one once checked up on us the whole time we were there. We waited probably a good 20min. My boyfriend was upset so he went to the front & asked if we could some water. This wouldn't have been a problem in the first place if someone actually came to check up on us. This experience wasn't the best out of all the times I've came. But we had bad service the time before this as well.   The food is good but I think they just lost one of their customers. We won't be returning again.",

My family and I usually get:  Pho Ap Chao- crispy cutlets of fried pho topped with a light sauce and a variety of veggies + protein. great dish to share and not too heavy  Bo Nuong Vi- healthy and flavorful BBQ mixture with rice wrapper, veggies, and lemongrass marinated meat (shrimp, beef, and/or squid). these meat selections are little/ no fat compared to KBBQ, and cheaper considering the shareable portions.   Hu Tieu- dry, clear noodles with chashu pork  (or other protein) with sauce inside, additional soup on the side.   Their service is A1.  Will definitely come back!",

    "text": "My first impression: \"This is where you bring your white friends when you don't want to scare them with Vietnamese food.\" It's clean and semi-prettied up, the way a PF Chang's would be.  But the food. Yeah. I can get down with the food here.   Pho here is perfect for any occasion; late night snack, hangover, allergies, cold, what-ever! The soup isn't too salty, nor is it seasoned so richly that it would be undesirable on a day that your tummy is doing flip flops.   I'm traditionally a Pho Dac Biet connoisseur, but their $11.95 oxtail pho was delicious. We each received 3 pieces of oxtail, 2 big bones, 1 small.  Egg rolls here were mo' betta to write home about than Pho Bosa. They make them the usual way here- served screaming hot with a meat and vermicelli filling. Served with the fish sauce that actually has shredded carrot in it. Go nuts and add the extra side of carrots and cucumbers if you want to add a little nutrition to your fried goodness.  Of course... add a dang coconut. Sure it's 4.75, but treat yo'self. Scrape the sides off and slurp up in a straw. Convince yourself it's a great source of hydration and healthy fats.  Friendly service, even from the grandparent types.  I had waning faith that Vegas knew what was up with Vietnamese food when I saw the glowing reviews on other places that I found to be a let down, but this place can hang with the rest of the cool kids at the top of my pho list.",

A family comes in clearly after us maybe 2-3 minutes and immediately gets seated without even referring to this list. Bad karma on the families part because they knew I was waiting. Now 4-5 minutes afterwards I'm sitting. Hope the food is worth it.   Got my food and it was good. The pho came really fast which isn't all hat surprising but now I am completely done with it and my gf and daughter still don't have there food. I think I may have to order something else when there food gets here because I'm going to be hungry.   About 10 minutes after my food arrived there's is now here. Take two.   My pho was good big pieces of tendon in the combination were the highlight. Over all nothing disappointing nothing great. Meh service my eggs had no fish sauce which sucked.    I wouldn't not come again but I won't go out of my way to eat here.",

Be careful employees because some people may just walk out and leave.   I ordered the small shrimp pho (they also have a veggie pho, but it's made with beef broth so it's not vegan friendly). My boyfriend ordered the beef steak one I think.  We were feeling under the weather so the soup did the trick, but if you're coming in with an appetite, order the large soup. When we got home we waited about an hour and were hungry again and got Mcdonalds so learn from our mistakes!  Food was prepared quickly and was delicious.",

    "text": "I'm not a pho snob, nor am I a Vietnamese food snob. However - I will tell you that for a place that is open almost 24 hrs, this is my go to spot for some late night feel good food.   You gotta start with the iconic fresh spring rolls (#2 is my go to, you can't go wrong)  The pho is everything that you would expect. Amazing broth, good meats and the iconic rice noodles you'd expect.  If you want to try something new - #36 (google it:bun rieu ) is amazing. It's a crab based soup (it has pork blood in it too, just a warning) but they throw these delicious crab-meatballs in it.   Not in the mood for soup? Try a \"bun\" - vermicelli noodles with your choice of meat, some veggies and fish sauce to your liking. It's awesome with the sweet chili sauce.   I always like ordering some side orders from here too - their charbroiled shrimp and pork are amazing. The beef is a little dry but it's ok. My new favorite is their pork chop - try one as a side order and eat it while it's hot! It's awesome - it's not all red/pink dyed like other Vietnamese restaurants do it, just marinated and grilled to perfection.   Something else that's fun is their Vietnamese BBQ. They bring a grill to your table along with the pre marinated meats and give you those rice wrappers (same as what they wrap their fresh spring rolls with) along with some lettuce and stuff. It's similar to Korean BBQ but you can taste the difference in the marinade. It's a good time.   Service is usually pretty quick. Don't expect to small talk and get to know your waiter's family history. These guys are always running circles around the place but don't be afraid to flag them down if you need something. Get in, enjoy your food and get out. This is a pretty fast paced place and I love it.   Definitely sit down and eat if you can. You can get everything to go but it's just not the same experience. If you do decide to get some pho to go - understand that the meat is basically raw when they throw it in the box because they rely on the piping hot broth to cook the meat. This is why I wouldn't suggest getting it to go, but if you have to - heat the broth separate until it's PIPING hot and then throw your meat in, mix it.",

Sometimes, when you want something hot, hearty, and something to coat your insides of goodness thick broth is where it's at. Banh Canh is normally made with a nice clear broth and thickened up by tapioca noodles and most restaurants substitute the tapioca noodles with udon and mix it with flour to thicken up the broth. Unfortunately, this was not the case with Viet Noodle Bar Banh Canh where the broth was the same constancy as regular Pho broth and the udon noodle was well... udon noodles.   I do have to say though, while the broth wasn't thick like how I like my Banh Canh to be, it was sure flavorful. The slices of pork were tender and shrimp cooked well.   End food review",

    "text": "Tried this place twice - ordered two different things and overall rating was, well, see below:  Ordered the salad the first time visiting - the flavors were not bad, and portions were alright. Nothing too special however.  The most recent time I visited the place was during lunch. The place was was half filled up. We had three people and were seated pretty quickly. Orders were taken within 10 minutes. The two coworkers received their entrees shortly after. Appetizer lost its meaning as they came after the entree (not a big deal).  My order however took over 20 minutes. So I sat awkwardly watching my coworkers eat. They could've planned this better. While I was waiting, I noticed in their storage bin where they keep eating utensils, there was one single strand of hair amongst the spoons. Let's just say it's short, wavy, and thicker than the hairs on your head.   Disgusted. Whatever it is it shouldn't be there.  Anyway my crab noodle soup arrived. Had already lost my appetite by that time. And honestly the food itself was not worth the wait or the money.",

I wasn't expecting a  great level of service at a busy pho place on a Sunday but I honestly feel offended. We were seated next to the station where 2 servers standing and completely ignored us when we said we were ready to order. Then they call over another server to come over to take the order and immediately he said:\" what do you want to order, let's go!\". I asked if they have Pho Bac and instead of a simple yes or no, the server sarcastically asked me back what pho Bac is, please educate him further. We immediately left. The whole conversation was in fluent Vietnamese on both sides so there wouldn't be any communication barriers. Just want to voice my opinion and frustration but honestly don't think one bad review will make a huge difference!",

We ordered the small bowl and it was more than enough for a single serving. The noodle to meat ratio was on point. The appetizers were delicious, hot & fresh. I've been to many pho restaurants in Vegas and this place has my vote. I love the wide range of variety  on their menu so that's a plus. Definitely coming back and highly recommend coming here.",

When you come in they invite you to sit pretty much anywhere and someone comes over and brings a fresh water as soon as you sit. Fast service and extremely friendly. Everything you need is at the table. I didn't enjoy the Spring Rolls as much, but I guess that's because I don't like the inside veggies as much as I thought. The sprouts were so fresh !

They don't have all the classic set combo pho dishes, you might have to create your own. I got a small pho tai bo vien, but like I said, not a combo, basically have to get extra meat so I think it was like 9.50 + 1.50 or 1.75. A little on the pricy side.

    "text": "I hit the jackpot in Vegas and it wasn't at a Casino. It was at Viet Noodle Bar. They are the real MVP.  BUN BO HUE. This is the real deal mother load. I've been on a BBH kick for months now, I can't get enough of it cooking at home, traveling, eating out in my city etc. There's a right way, and a \"cheating\" way to assemble a bowl in my humble opinion. Americanized places often go lighter and the True Asian places come in heavy. This is THE BEST place to get Bun Bo Bue- a spicy Vietnamese noodle dish served with different noodles and meats than it's more popular cousin, pho. In order for the bowl to be MOST authentic, it's got to have all the right ingredients, which means tendon, congealed blood, a pork hock, and other slices of beef like brisket and flank. The veggie accompaniments include bean sprouts, cabbage, lime, cilantro, basil, and shio leaf. This is an authentic version and not a watered down wimpy version to apease American taste buds.  This bun bo hue is a solid 5. When there is a dish that you eat on the weekly, you have to find your spot, and I've found mine in Vegas.  Also nem nuong is not on the menu as a spring roll but they will make it upon request. It's a crowd favorite with the fried crunchy wrapper in the middle with the savory viet spam. Bonus points to Viet Noodle Bar.",

We were looking for a place that opened early morning and found that the Viet Noodle Bar opened at 9am! We got there at 8:57 and it was already open and ready to go so that was perfect.   1. Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio - (10.95$) - I LOVE my charbroiled pork vermicelli. The meat was nice and soft, and very juicy, but the eggrolls could have been better. Portion was fairly big though for the price so i'm not complaining.   I read a lot of reviews saying customer service was lacking but I had the complete opposite experience. Well, we came when it just opened and there was only one other party dining at the time so that may be why? But the workers were very attentive and kept checking up on us to make sure we were doing alright.   The decor of the place is really nice, there's a bar area in the back and their wall designs are cute. Their little teapot set is also super cute. So overall, good first experience. Not bad for Viet food in Vegas, coming from the SGV. Customer service was great, prices were good, parking wasn't bad, food was good.  PLUS their hours are amazing. 9a.m - 6a.m ! Perfect cure for drunkies and hungovers.",

    "text": "Based on reviews I was really excited to try this restaurant out for some pho but I had a less than stellar experience. Food wise I would give them 3 stars; not bad but not great. The pho and egg rolls were both very mediocre. The service deserves 0 stars but that is not an option, so overall I'll be nice and give it the minimal 1 star.   The service here was some of the worst I've had in a while. When you enter the restaurant there's a sheet of paper asking for your name and amount of people in your party, which is placed next to a sign that says 'Please wait to be seated'. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, yet no one event approached us until at least 5 minutes of waiting by the sign in sheet. There were only 2 of us and 3 men chit chatting around their register off to the side.   After getting seated, getting waters & taking our orders, we were never once asked if we need anything again; water refills, asked if the food was good, asked if we needed our bill, asked if we wanted dessert...nothing. We were there for over 2 hours. Every time we had to go out of our way to get someone's attention, yet the booth directly behind us seemed to have a good amount of attention from their server. I asked for some extra jalapenos & lime (2 slices of jalapenos & 1 tiny lime slice is all that came with my pho), which never came out at all.   After waiting forever we had to ask a random worker passing by if we could finally get our check and some to-go boxes. We receive the check, place our debit card down and leave it at the edge of the table. Another 15-20 minutes passes by before we have to find someone to please process our payment, so we could leave.   There are way better pho places in Las Vegas for both food and definitely for service. This whole experience was a disappointment, a waste of $40 and a huge waste of my time. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE!!!",

For most Asian joints that is rare. The food isn't the best but if you are looking for a Vietnamese joint it is decent. It is a little pricey but you are paying for their long operation hours and ma and pa restaurant overhead. I got the Pho AP Chao with Bo. It was packed full of veggies and meat I forgot it was suppose to come with noodles. I enjoy their eggrolls and fish sauce was well balanced. I would definitely come here again.   Side note: they have TV with sports. My team happened to be on.",

    "text": "First time having Vietnamese BBQ thanks to my friend. We got the beef, shrimp and squid BBQ. It comes with spring roll wrap and water, and a huge plate of veggies and some sauces. I usually eat spring rolls with a peanut sauce. These were a little different but both tasted good. This was definitely a cool experience and it was delicious! You grill your own meat and make your own spring rolls. Don't make them too big like me or you won't be able to wrap them :D We ordered the crispy egg noodles stir fried with seafood. I was impatient and started eating it before the noodles could soak up the sauce on the plate. There was not much flavor, but when I tried it later it was good but not my fave. We also ordered calamari which was good. We got the woven vermicelli and some type of fried tofu as well. By the time we were done with all that food, we were pretty stuffed, but after reading some of the reviews about the bun bo hue, I wanted to try it so we ordered that too. The broth was so flavorful. The noodles were a little harder than what I prefer. My friends agreed with me. I asked the waiter to just bring a small bowl since we were stuffed but by the time I told him my order was on its way to our table. Their service is very good and they get your orders out pretty fast. Definitely going back for the BBQ.",

Then District One came along, a spot that adds some love with each bowl, a smile on my face and a satisfied belly, but the service was pretty terrible so it became hard to go back often. Fast forward a year and Viet Noodle Bar opens up from the same family that runs District One. Focused on more traditional styles of Vietnamese cuisine, but with the same amount of love as D1.  Like ramen, pho is made from bones, so if your lips aren't glistening with deconstructed bone marrow, then you might be slurping on soup blocks. Using soup blocks makes it pretty easy for some places to offer that $5.95 price point. Although its a bit pricey at VNB, they're not shorting you with portion size, especially if you're a meat lover, they load the bowl up (maybe too much)! Bun thit nuong is a great alternative when you're not feeling soup, pretty much a Vietnamese pasta salad with grilled pork and the best fish sauce.   VNB definitely isn't messing around with its food, or the SNHD, it wins the cleanest Vietnamese restaurant award. Can't give the same award for service though, lunch service is fairly disconnected from its dinner service. Regardless its me and bo approved, so I'll be back all winter long.",

It is should be after Decatur and before Lindell to the right hand side with prominent signage.  The decor was very American and had next to no Asian or Vietnamese influences. They also decided to play 2000's rock. But this is beside the fact because the service was good and the food was authentic. I know my Vietnamese food and will not just scarf down anything and give a thumbs up.   I had the dry egg noodle with seafood. The noodles were fine and the dish was surprisingly filling even though it looked like a small portion. We also had pork chop and egg rolls. Everything was delicious.   The restaurant started to fill up for late dinner so we needed to flag servers down to close out our table. But they were so nice and accommodating and that was a testament to how good they are. They even refilled our drinks at the end without us asking. I would eat there again on another Vegas trip.",

Everyone's pho or dish was either too salty or not hot enough. I ordered the prime rib pho and it was just one large clump of beef on top of my pho. We would not be returning so now we have to find another pho place to eat.",

    "text": "Viet Noodle Bar is without a doubt my favorite restaurant in the entire Las Vegas valley. I don't give that kind of praise out lightly, either. My family has known this restaurant and its owners all the way back when they branched off from Pho So 1, and they've given us nothing but quality for the years and years we've known them. I digress, though.   When you first walk into the restaurant, you're greeted with a charming atmosphere and very friendly staff, who always seem to handle things beautifully whether they're completely empty (rarely, in my experience) or absolutely packed. The menu has a great variety, and everything I've tried has been top notch, from the classic pho thai or pho tom (Pho with flank steak / shrimp) to the vermicelli bowls (Protein of your choice atop a bed of rice noodles atop a crisp, fresh salad), to the udon (Simple udon soup done right). There's more yet to try, like their porridge but that'll be for another day. Great portion sizes, too. I've never left there hungry.  The part I love most about this restaurant would have to be how delicious and filling the meal can be without feeling overmuch. The menu uses so many fresh ingredients and clean options that I always just *feel* good after visiting. Good stuff overall.  I recommend this restaurant to everyone I know, and thought it only right to take my praise to Yelp. Do yourself a favor and visit this place next time you're down on Spring Mountain. Well worth your time!",

Sadly, I was not impressed at all.  First, let me tell you about this dish.   Bun Bo Hue is a popular Vietnamese soup that is made with rice vermicelli noodles (Bun) and beef (Bo) and Hue is for the city in central Vietnam. The dish is greatly admired for its balance of SPICY, SOUR, SALTY and SWEET flavors and the predominant flavor of LEMON GRASS.  For me, the broth was not spicy, sour, salty or sweet at all. It was just salty. Huge letdown.   Second, there were NO BLOOD CUBES in my dish - which was what I was looking forward to the most.   Third, I wanted to see some PORK KNUCKLES. NONE! I just want the real deal. Not the washed down version.   Wishing someone would open up a real Bun Bo Hue shop in Las Vegas ....",

    "text": "First impression of Viet Noodle Bar.  Definitely a very clean Vietnamese restaurant, with a lot of TVs showing sports game (at least at the time of my visit).  It felt like a pho restaurant and sports bar hybrid, without the annoying cigarette smoke and greasy spoons that are allegedly washed.  It is very roomy too, unlike many mom and pop type restaurants that error on the side of cramming more tables and chairs than the premise can comfortably accommodate.  Based on reading the tips and glancing over some reviews, I knew I had to give their Oxtail Pho a try on my first visit.  Plus the outside temperature is cool, a bit breezy, almost fall-like weather, so a bowl of steamy hot bowl of noodles is perfect.  The waiter that took my order was courteous, not too pushy, and gave me plenty of time to explore and take pictures of their menu.  I also didn't have to wait too long when asking for my bill or the credit card to be processed.    The Oxtail Pho also came out of the kitchen fairly quickly, but that is typical of any well run pho restaurant (it is not like they start cooking your from scratch the moment they receive the customer's order).  The portion is good, and there were several large oxtails in the bowl.  The flavor of the broth is good, and the oxtail was cooked fairly well (tender but not to the point that it will easily yield its tasty morsel with a bit of pressure).  I didn't feel that they skimped on the noodles either, which is great (since I always get that feeling at the most popular pho restaurant in Vegas frequented by tourists that's shall not be named).   Next time I visit I will likely try one of their vermicelli noodle or rice plates (sadly i did not see any Broken Rice aka Cm tm dishes in their menu).",

We split the beef bbq grill thing, which was extremely reasonable in price considering how much you get! We were stuffed. I loved the abundance of vegetables and rice paper (that you can ask for seconds of). The meat itself was decent quality as well.  I found it a little strange that they do not oil the grill, since the meat kept sticking and burning to it. The sauce was not to my liking as well, but I improvised with some sriracha and hoisin.   Service was surprisingly friendly for Vietnamese place. The interior is wide open with high ceilings and intimidating fans, which did not do much in terms of getting rid of odor. We stank of meat to high heaven afterwards!  I will definitely go back to try the pho an other items.   Parking is plentiful and location is easy to get to as well!",

Service is disappointing and 2 of our pho orders were delivered to our table, 10 minutes after 5 of our rice dishes were served.  Service: Staff is friendly but they weren't very attentive to their surroundings. When we arrived around 7pm the place was half empty but staff took about 10min or so before they checked the waiting list. After being seated they took our orders quickly but oddly enough we got our rice dishes quickly, but it took another 10min before we got any of our noodle dishes (pho).  Food: yo, it's pretty damn good. Pho broth was good and they give great meat portions. The rice dishes are a hit and miss. They give great portions, however the rice was odd, a bit too dry, but when it came to the meat we ordered the pork chop and chicken, both were very moist.",

We wrote our names on the list and there was 3 parties ahead of us and the waiting room was so tiny people had to wait outside which is no big deal. We waited 15 mins and notice why haven't we got called yet even though i knew it was busy that day but those 3 parties ahead of us were like 2 people -__- so we went inside checked the list and they crossed out our names. Wth they never bothered to go outside and call the names.Were they too lazy to check outside? Which btw i was by the door and when i said something he didn't bother to apologize and said oh we have a table waiting which is good because i would of left if i had to wait again  2nd. We ordered our food. 20 mins pass giving them the benefit of the doubt that its just so busy they'll come. 15 mins after i was losing my cool and told the staff why hasn't our food came out yet we've been waiting for over 20 mins now and people that were sitting next to us came after us and finished their food already. He apologized which is good because sometimes they don't say sorry and our waiter never bothered to check up on us. LORD i was just so fed up how the way they treat customers that isn't a big party.  Overall i would not come back here, the lack of customer service just did it for me. I mean the food was great but never again.",

    "text": "I love Vietnamese food so I was especially happy to find Viet Noodle Bar on Yelp. My husband and I ventured into this establishment after attending a three day conference in Vegas. However, I was concerned when we walked in as the restaurant was rather empty.   Thankfully my concerns were put to rest when my husband's food arrived. I had a young coconut which was brought out on a small plate with a straw and spoon. It was ice cold so I let it warm up to cool before drinking it. I saved the inside to eat as my dessert :) My pho was very good. The veggies were PERFECT for my taste. They were probably put into the bowl raw and the super hot broth just barely cooked them. The broth itself had very good flavor. It's not the best I've ever had, but I could say it was probably second place :)  My husband's bun was outstanding!  I would give it a try the next time we are in Vegas. The flavors of the stir-fried toppings were fantastic!!   They also have a great selection of desserts. Maybe next time I will be hungry enough for one ;)  Overall, I highly recommend Viet Noodle Bar. The server was very friendly and patient as we looked over the large menu. The prices, quality and portions are VERY reasonable.",

The service has been the best compared to the other Vietnamese restaurants in town. The servers are friendly and attentive.  Thit Nuong Cuon (Charbroiled Pork Spring Rolls): Tasted a little soapy probably because of all the cilantro. Not as meaty as the spring rolls from other places. 3/5  Bo Nuong Cuon (Charbroiled Beef Spring Rolls): Nice grilled flavor on the tender beef. 4/5  Pho Tai Nam: Flank steak and rare steak pho. Their pho comes in 2 sizes: regular and large. I ordered large but it's quite small. The broth is good and they're pretty generous with the meat. 4/5  I was so happy they have soy bean milk!

    "text": "Great pho place to eat, one of my favorite in Las Vegas. I enjoy this place to eat since it's affordable and tasty. I have only tried the pho and the rice with short rib and chicken. For the appetizers, we got egg rolls   The egg rolls are amazing, it's about $7 and it has about 4 egg rolls for it. It tasted so good, not over cooked and not too soft, tasted perfect. The inside of the egg roll tasted so good, and the sauce makes it taste sweet. It's a nice balance of flavor and right amount of crunchiness to the outside.   The pho is amazing, the price is about $7-9 either for a small or large. The small is BIG, and the big is even bigger. I can't believe that they even have a size difference since they're both way too big for me to finish. The meat is really good, taste fresh and has a lot of flavor so you know it's not frozen at least. The noodle is really good, and I AM SO GLAD THEY DID NOT GIVE TOO MUCH NOODLE IN MY PHO. The soup is really good, it's sweet but really savory, I enjoy it so much and it's better than all the other pho places I've been in Las Vegas.   The meat with rice tasted amazing even though I didn't get it. This costed about $9 and the plate is so big with many different options. They give so much meat compared to other pho places and they're so generous with all the proportion. The meat Is Sweet and has a lot of flavor, it is so soft when you bite into it. The rice is good, not too much water is added in making the rice and we added an egg to it for $2 extra. The egg is amazing, well worth the price and has a lot of flavor.   However, there are some improvements they need to it. First of all, they need to check your tables a little for frequently since when we are trying to pay the bill, it took about 5 minutes to come to us. Second, the seats at the booths are so uncomfortable, and so sensitive to the person behind you that you see sitting so it kept on wobbling.",

WTF!\" his exasperated reply.  Sadistic teasing of my bud aside, thanks to a large workforce of first generation Asian Americans, Vegas  boast some of the best Vietnamese food in the country.  That said, from the creator of District One comes Viet Noodle Bar.  The extensive menu is very diverse with classic, authentic Vietnamese dishes along side more \"Americanized\" creations.  There's something for everyone.  Oh and the food is good.  Top props to the oxtail pho.  Matching that of District One, deep, beefy flavor, tons of gelatin that coats the lips.  Fall off the bone tender oxtail.  What's not to like.    Their standard pho, uses the same beefy broth and is good.  Steaming hot, loads of fresh veg, generous quantity of good quality protein (the tendon is very clean and soft).  Offered in two sizes.  Additional meat available for a modest up charge if your carnivore cravings are in full effect.  Good selection of soups, rice plates and vegetarian dishes.  Have not tried those.  However, do not pass on one of their BBQ (think KBBQ with veggies to wrap the proteins) or in a vinegar hotpot (think shabu shabu with wrapping the proteins then dipping in sauces).  Beef, shrimp, and/or squid, lightly seasoned and drizzled with sesame.  Wrap with classic \"pickled veg\", vermicelli, mint, basil, cucumbers and dip in a chili or fish sauce.  BBQ is more approachable, the vinegar hotpot, imparts a somewhat tart flavor and clear aroma that pairs well with the fish sauce.  In the end, fun and just good eats.  Prices are very fair and in line with other off Strip Vietnamese places.    Very clean dining room.  Good, friendly, off Strip service.  In a word, solid.",

As a pho-fessional, I take my pho seriously bc I used to eat it for breakfast everyday when my parents cooked it.!  I got the pho rib eye, and the meat was so tender. I love how you can actually taste the diff spices in the pho (anise, coriander, cinnamon) bc I normally never get much of that flavor/scent @ other pho places. The broth definitely had MSG in it but not enough to make you feel super thirsty. My only complaint would be that a lot of the meat was stuck together, but that might also be the reason why the meat stays so tender  the broth had the perfect amount of depth... ask for their vinegar onions if y'all like it bc it's not too vinegary & just right. The pho is more on the pricier side but I've always believed that there's no such thing as amazing pho that's less than $10 @ a restaurant bc it requires so much bone broth and time; you do get what you pay for.  All in all, def one of my go tos now if I'm in the area. It's better than almost all pho in the 626/LA area and on par with OC pho places. Def give this place a try if u phokin love pho like I do",

Most of the fam bam got banh hoi which is ting noodles weaved together with a side of your meat and veggies. Dip this in either the regular fish sauce or the stinky sauce (stinky used in the most delicious stinky way possible) and its heaven in your mouth. The service was okay - but again, it's a viet place in Vegas so you might as well mirror the little Saigon experience.   Defiantly stop by if you want some authentic Vietnamese food with good flavors.",

I read the Yelp reviews for Viet Noodle Bar yesterday and was so happy to see that they opened at 9am on Sunday!  Woohoo!!!!    I convinced hubby to drive to Chinatown to have pho for breakfast instead of our usual Eggworks... I ordered the large pho with flank and tendons -- YUMMY! The broth was so clear and \"clean\".  The fresh rolls (pork and shrimp) were deeeeeelicious and hubby enjoyed the steak and rice.  Thank you, Viet Noodle Bar!  Can't wait to come back to try the bun!  :-)",

    "text": "Why this place has 4+ stars blows my mind!!!! I came here with my family (6 people) to enjoy a meal before we head back to LA. It was one of the worse Asian restaurant experience ever!...   When we arrive, the restaurant was half empty. I wrote my name on the list & stood at the door waiting to be seated. It took a while to get seated & orders in. We had to flag down 2-3 people to finally get our orders in.  Now, growing up in a Vietnamese household & LA/OC, I'm familiar with the dishes we ordered, below. I'm also use to eating delicious food & receiving bad service (freaking asians!!), but I return for the tasty meals.   The dishes were below mediocre. If I had tried it the first time here, I would never order it again. Not only that, the service is horrible. My brothers dish came out after everyone else finish our meal, that's after we had to flag down 3 people to remind & ask them for it.  Goi Cuon- it was ok.  Bo Nhung Cuon- the lemon grass seasoning for the beef was really good in the spring roll.   Bun Rieu- this is one of my favorite noodle dishes but it was a disappointment.   Bo Luc Lac- the beef was bland, dry. We had to hassle the server 2-3 times for salt/pepper/lime, which should of been brought out with the dish by default.  Bun Bo Hue- it was ok, nothing spectacular about it. We had to hassle a couple people for chili oil to make the broth \"Bun Bo Hue\" spicy!  Mi Xa Xiu- the dish they forgot to bring out. There was nothing BBQ about it. The meat looked like boiled pork. When we brought up the issue, they said that's how Xa Xiu is... what a lie!   Vermicelli Noodles- my parents got this. They were not impressed but ill leave it at that.  Overall, I will not go back to this restaurant. I do not recommend it to anyone that wants good Vietnamese food. Their food was disappointing & service is below satisfaction. I would rather give another restaurant a shot.",

Their shrimp and beef grill is well worth coming here since there isn't a restaurant that serves this dish in Vegas. Other than that, my family enjoys their Bun Bo Hue, Cha Goi and Banh Xeo here. This place is the new \"hot spot\" for Pho, but in my opinion their pho is not the best. The interior design is pretty nice and for a Vietnamese restaurant, it's surprising clean. The best part of this restaurant, is their service, you don't get good service and any other Vietnamese restaurants in town.  Update: The Com Ga Roti is literally the best dish on their menu. I will come back for this dish!",

EXPECTATIONS GOING IN * Any Vietnamese restaurant that suffixes the restaurant name with \"Bar\" rather than an obscure number means pricey ethnic food  FOOD * Though I waited much too long for a meatball pho, the broth stayed hot most of the way through.. just the way I like it! * The pho broth was relatively rich but not as beefy as I prefer  VALUE * $7-$10 ish, so average $10-$15 pp  IMPRESSION OVERALL * While the service of the male server really deterred us from returning here (he spilled broth on my friend without acknowledging/apologizing, Exhibit B: my meatball pho took over 45 minutes... as in, I was watching a Sunday football game at the start of the 2nd half and watched the last few minutes when by soup came), the generous and sweet owner redeemed his restaurant by picking up his staff's slack near the latter half of our meal. It helped that he comped my pho (without my knowledge until the bill arrived) to compensate for the inconvenience of my hangry arse watching my friends eat for an hour * Considering how loudly obnoxious we were and occupying our table for over two hours, we were surprisingly not kicked out or even scolded  ENVIRONMENT / AMBIANCE * Clean, partially dim setting with large flat screen TVs with a partial liquor license -- a bit too bright to be a True bar, but I now understand the Owner's logic in naming the restaurant * Platformed booths hugging 3 walls of the large dining room * This place is much classier than our usual haunt, Pho Kinh Do, where hungover partygoers may swig on their fifth of hard liquor of choice freely while eating  WOW FACTOR * The Owner -- in addition to the anecdotes I had already recalled aforementioned, this story rounds out our visit here nicely: one of our friends packed up her leftovers and left it in the restaurant.

But the rice served with the filet mignon stir fry was orange colored and looked tasty but there's no special flavor to the rice which was odd.  I ordered the beef noodle soup and noodles was not great, over cooked, was falling apart in my soup, and making my soup cloudy. No special house chilly sauces to put in your noodles. Tendon was not soft meaning it wasn't cooked long enough.  Pork chop over rice was average. Nothing special.   Don't order the calamari. It's not that special either. Shrimp egg roll is good. Vietnamese crepe was really good (make sure they don't forget the fish dipping sauce).",

    "text": "Gotta be the best if not one of the best Pho joints in LV.   Had the Pho with oxtail. The soup came out with two big oxtail bones and a little bone. Soup was savory and delish. Think one of the better pho bowl you ever had mixed with a taste of home made pho. That is what the broth tasted like.   If you like Goi/ Vietnamese crunchy sour salad. Get their vinegar onions and add lemon and sirracha to it. Was hella bomb with the pho.   Man, I wish this place was in SJ.",

Got there around 3pm , not a lot of people, that could be why service was fast! amazing! Food was good. We got the spring roll with charbroiled pork ..chicken wings was very tasty and unique in a good way, i would order it again...chicken based soup with pork trimmings was good too...combo steam rice with charbroiled beef ribs plus the fried egg was my favorite! .. the combination fried rice was also a good one. Serving size was enough for one , not too much not too little.. so Id say the price we paid was reasonable .. i would come back again and try the other dishes.",

I got a beef plate with rice, by wanted to change the rice out for red rice or French rice. The guy still didn't understand what that was, even though the menu shows a picture of \"red rice\"! Literally, the rice is red, what don't you understand??? Ordered fried egg rolls also and that never came out. Server apologized and didn't do anything, didn't even bother to ask if I still wanted the Egg rolls or not. Service is garbage, food was pretty bad too. The rice came out hard, some pieces not cooked, and the beef that came with it was thinly sliced, barely enough to feed even a baby. Hated the place, would never come back here again.",

Loved the iced coffee because they made it the old school way with a metal filter on top of a coffee cup and a cup of ice.  The dac biet pho was good; lots of meats, tendons, tripe, and good broth.  It was pretty filling.  The service was very attentive, and you could tell this was a family-run restaurant.  The prices were a bit pricier than what I'd expect from a place off-strip, but it was clean and trendy with a few flat-screen TVs.  Sure, I'd come back if I were in the area.",

I have been to other restaurant, and they always give me really bad service and this is one of the few places I would say that impressed me. They have great taste on music. They would check on you ever now and then to make sure you need a refill on your beverage. After your done with your meal they would offer you dessert if you're interested. They made me feel very welcome and comfortable didn't feel like I was being rushed to eat my food. I'm going to make this my new spot to eat and hang with friends.",

I'm Vietnamese and it's rare for me to find a place where all the flavors of my favorite entrees are just right. I also like the staff, they're all so friendly and attentive. Check them out!",

Their portion is generous and they got variety of food choices that most of the times you wont fail. I usually get pho with flank in a small size, but last time, I tried their crispy pho with seafood, and it was the best Vietnamese food I ever had. I have tried this at Pho so 1 as well, but VNB definitely did a better job! I asked for shrimps only on my plate, and they made sure I got extra shrimps. Great place to get your lunch.",

    "text": "I first heard about VNB after hearing the news that the brother of one of my fave restaurants, District One, was going to open a straight-up Vietnamese restaurant. Had to check it out. I remember when this place used to be Pho Hung, and that was a HUGE disappointment. Luckily as I found out, location has nothing to do with a restaurant's success, it's all about the people, and man, they found a good ones at VNB.  My first mark on trying a Vietnamese restaurant is always the Pho. I don't know why that is. Maybe it's my perception that when a restaurant nails something that is basic to their theme, then everything else must be great. I have been burned by this theory before, but that's my story, and I'll stick to it. And their Pho btw is really good, probably the best one in Las Vegas. It's fragrant and beefy, while staying relatively clear. The meat is fresh and of good quality. I've had appetizers like the spring rolls and banh xeo (think of a giant, seafood stuffed crepe), as well as many others, and they too, were the best I've had in Vegas.  But, if you want to take a walk on the wild side, I would recommend coming with a compadre, and ordering the Bo Tom Nuong Vi. It's the only one of it's kind in Vegas, and apparently, the closest other location is in Southern Cal. Basically, it's Korean BBQ or Shabu Shabu (depending upon which version you choose to order), and make-your-own spring rolls, combined into one dish. It's fun, and exciting, and I enjoyed it very much.  I've heard some stories about the service, but all of my experiences have been great, including when this place is super busy. Is VNB the best Vietnamese restaurant I've ever had? No, but it's in my Top 3, and all three are worthy of 5 stars. Best Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas, and I don't think anything comes close. My spot!",

I started with order of beef spring rolls. I normally get regular spring rolls with the shrimp but felt like trying something different besides this was my first visit. So figure why not. I was totally psyched I did!!! Because the beef spring rolls were amazing. It looks just like any basic spring roll. You add the charred beef talk about game changer. The dipping sauce not your heavy peanut sauce but lighter sauce. Not sure the sauce was but all know accented the springs roll on point. I know should went with all the rave the oxtail soup. I feeling more wanted lots of the different meats or the combination pho. I got the large bowl. Talk about awesome pho action. The broth for me always the winnah or loser in any pho battle. I feel the broth Viet Noodle Bar was really good. It had nice depth and truth I could have gone with the siracha and hoisin sauce always add. It tradition and adds even more depth to the broth. The large talk about nice portion of not only the noodles but the meats all the good stuff. I have had Pho at lot of places and not given get large nice equal portion of both. I did see few oxtail Pho coming out and no doubt need come back soon try that one next.  The restaurant is lot bigger then it lots from the outside. I enjoy the look with the booths and tables. One wall nice artwork think cow or something sorry forgot. Make sure put it in updated review. LOL. The same area bar stools so if restaurant packed it just you got place get your grub on. Few nice widescreen televisions around if watch sports game. It very much modern feel too it. Unlike most Vietnamese restaurant where pretty basic nothing but bland walls and tables usually pretty close to one another. Viet Noodle Bar far from and just refreshing place get some Pho on then seeing Oxtail Pho not many places offer bonus!!!   No doubt plan on coming back again because need get some Oxtail action in.",

    "text": "Living in San Jose with plenty of hole-in-the-walls and glamorized pho restaurants, I personally thought the food was legit at Viet Noodle Bar.   Pros  Service: My waiter was super nice and apologized many times about the wait times since it was a full house during New Years.   Pho Dac Biet: The broth, the most important component for pho was delicious and it hit the spot since Las Vegas during NYE week was cold AF.     Mi Hai Vi: The dry egg noodles with seafood was delicious. I was happy that they had a sauce for their egg noodles versus just leaving it plain which I've experienced at other restaurants; however, the sauce was more on sweeter side. I also personally love their version of the thin egg noodles.   Prices: All the entrees are reasonably priced and the portions were good.   Overall great spot for Vietnamese grub that offers an assortment of Vietnamese entrees and not just noodle soups. I decided to give this place 5 instead of 4 stars because my boyfriend whose had his fair share of pho spots in Vegas mentioned this place was the best for pho.",

Coming from NY, we don't really have many pho places around here and I was dying for some homey pho from the West coast. The service was very quick and friendly. Although we were a group of 5 with multiple little annoying requests, they didn't mess our order up LOL!   The pho itself is extremely affordable, unlike the pho in NYC. The portion size was reasonable for the $8 bucks or so that we spent. Let's just say we all left happily satisfied with our meal. The pho broth was phenomenal. It really reminds me of my parent's homemade pho (that's saying a lot because I've eaten plenty of pho and not many can be compared to my parents' home cooking). The noodles, beef, broth, everything was just cooked deliciously.   If I come to Vegas again, I would definitely give this place another go!",

There are only a few places I know what have great pho.    I always get the combination in a large because why not and a Thai tea. Ambience in here is okay, the workers are a little unresponsive but the food makes up for it. Always leaving here satisfied with my meal. Prices are also fair for the quality of the food. There's plenty of tables inside this restaurant so you'll get seated pretty quickly unless they aren't paying you any attention and there's a parking lot right outside so you don't need to be doing any sort of walking especially after you fill up on some great food!",

Viet Noodle Bar did not disappoint at all! I ordered the #10 Pho dish, where you have a choice of 4 meats---but I only got it with 3, which were: flank, brisket and tendon. The broth was super flavorful, so hearty and full of spice.   I came here with my love and a friend and our friend mentioned this thing called 'pho oil.' He ordered a bowl of pho oil for the table, and OMFG... two spoonfuls of this pho oil enhanced the flavor of the pho by 100000 notches, it was unbelievable. *gasp face emoji* So be sure to order it when you go to this place. Try the broth out normally first and then put a spoonful of pho oil and taste the amazing difference.  I also got a Thai iced tea, and normally I always get disappointed when I order it at restaurants because it taste watered down, but this particular Thai iced tea was DAAAAAAANK. Definitely paired well with bowl of pho.  A few things I do admire about this place is each person gets their own saucer of bean sprouts, basil, limes and jalapenos and the attentive service that the waiters provided.   I'm so excited for my next pho craving because I know I will be here again!",

I have never been anywhere even in Hawaii, that gives you such big pieces of oxtail! It is also cooked perfectly, the meet falls off the bone and has so much flavor.  The cha gio/spring rolls are also very good. There is a lot of meat inside and they don't try to fill it with too much veggies.  The atmosphere is also very relaxing and chill. It is off the strip but still close by. You can also order grilled/your own meat here too. Very cool. I will recommend to my friends.",

The pho dac biet was packed with meat and the broth was fragrant but not necessarily flavorful. I soaked the jalepenos in the broth to give it a nice kick. The bun bo hue was good but in a smaller portion than what I'd expect for the price. The egg rolls were really crunchy and perfect wrapped in lettuce and such to dip into their fish sauce. Overall this was a great spot but a little more pricey than what I'm use to back at home. They're also open 9am - 6am so it makes it easy to drop in at almost all hours of the day.",

It came with three GIANT nuggets of oxtail, soaked in a broth rich with clove and anise. With the addition of a couple sprigs of basil and just a touch of lime (and I always kick up the heat)...this is one of the best, heartiest, most succulent bowls of pho I've ever had!!

    "text": "My boyfriend and I go here everyday for their Vietnamese coffee. We've tried so many different Vietnamese restaurants looking for the best coffee but everywhere else fell short. At a lot of places it was made too sweet, or they barely filled our cup, some places had a hazelnut flavor to them, some tasted more like water, some places were too busy and took forever, a couple places were inconsistent w/ having good coffee but this place is PERFECT. The coffee is strong and does it's job to keep me awake until 4 or 5 AM.   We also have eaten here a few times, too. Their menu is very large. I've seen hot pot and raw meats with grills here and so many different plates of amazing looking food. I've only tried the beef stew noodle soup, shrimp udon noodle soup, charbroiled spring rolls, regular spring rolls, and their vermicelli noodle salads.  The beef stew noodle soup and shrimp udon noodle soup were so amazing. They were both packed with so much flavor. The beef stew noodle soup was once ordered by me and ordered again by my boyfriend on a different occasion. That's how good it is! I'd also order the shrimp udon noodle soup again. It didn't need anything else added in it except of course, crispy & fresh bean sprouts!   I also tried their lemongrass beef vermicelli noodle salad once which I've never seen on a menu before so I HAD to try it and I don't know if I'll EVER eat vermicelli noodle salad topped w/ anything else again. I can't even describe how good it was!! All of the flavors could be tasted in each bite, the beef was tender, and I was given a generous amount of it. Mmmm.   We also had their charbroiled chicken spring rolls, which was another item I've never seen on a menu before. I LOVED them. I loved that I could have Chicken in my spring rolls instead of pork! They served it w/ a delicious sweet fish sauce but I think it would have been good w/ the peanut sauce as well!   The waiters and waitresses here are always friendly and quick even when they're busy! They always take care of us when we walk in and one of the waitresses even remembers us and gets us coffee before we have to ask! I'll continue going here as long as they're open, they're awesome!",

I've been here a few times, and the combination pho bowl has gone from large to a smaller size for their \"regular\" bowl. I'm kind of bummed about that, but their increasing popularity may be to blame.   The meat melted in my mouth the first time, and the quality has gone down a bit, but the broth has been consistently good, so I can live with it.   They have a variety of choices for the spring rolls, and my fave so far has been the Charboiled pork versus the shrimp. The shocker was the fried calamari. It's most likely the frozen kind, but they serve it with a spicy mayo that was pretty dang good-- definitely unexpected for a pho place.   I hope they keep their pho broth consistent since that's the main appeal for me.   The only disappointment here were the egg rolls. I say they're slightly below average.   I'll definitely be back to try other dishes.",

They are very hard to please and generally either the flavors aren't there or the portion size is too small at every restaurant I take the time to.  However, we found a winner with Viet Noodle Bar.  They were impressed by the flavor of the pho broth and the portion size. I ordered the bun bo hue and it was one of the best I've had in Vegas...the only negative is there is no pork hock.  Also, no pork blood...but I generally opt out of that anyways.  The broth was mildly spicy with a strong flavor of lemongrass.  My brother tried the oxtail pho and was impressed by the generous portion of oxtail.  Just beware...it takes a lot of more effort to eat oxtail pho than regular pho...not for the faint of heart.  Some of the other dishes ordered by my fam included the vermicelli bowls...which were humongous.  I like that they have the option of picking what you want in the bowl, i.e. 1-3 items and paying extra and you can pick the meat, egg rolls, etc.  The only item that wasn't a hit was the charbroiled beef.  It was thin sliced beef that seemed a tad dry.  Otherwise everything else was a hit with the family.  The establishment is clean and the servers were actually attentive.",

I never write negative posts based on just one bad visit because I think it's very biased and a lot of times I don't like to rely on Yelp because I feel like a lot of people write their posts based on that one negative incident.  Well I'm writing this after 3-4 bad incidents. Forget about being served even water if the place is busy with larger parties. The two or three servers there become so concentrated on that one large party that two top tables are completely ignored. This has happened to me at least 3 times. I've had to waive the servers down for water and to take our order, which of course never came out until I had to walk to the counter and ask where our food is (minimum 45 min later). I work in the food and industry myself and I completely understand what it's like to get swamped. But do not lie or blame the kitchen for your mistakes when I clearly see u not input our orders into the pos and go straight to serving the large parties.   remember.. this post is NOT based on one incident but multiple!",

He offered to replace our grill when we had cooked so much meat on it, refilled my drink without me asking and continued to check on us if we needed anything else. The service there shows team effort and is a plus during your dining experience. Our meal was great and way too much for 2 people. They offered for us to cook and take it all home but we couldn't since our hotel had no fridge (they even offered to let me take my water on the go). Overall it was a new dining experience and it was all thanks to their cooks and passionate waiters.",

    "text": "We decided to try this pho place after seeing so many good reviews for it and we were not disappointed!   The BF and I decided to share a large bowl of beef flank pho and after our waitress figured out we were sharing, she suggested that we can also add in the rare beef into the same pho. It was super nice that she gave us that suggestion, she could have totally just gone on her way after taking our order. The food came super fast, I felt like she walked away and then came back with our spring roll order! The pho came not too long after that.   About the pho, it was delicious! Our pho experience has mainly been in Chicago's Argyle Street (not sure how much it speaks to authenticity), I feel like the broth I've had in Chicago is a little bit lighter. Regardless, Viet Noodle Bar's pho is good!  The beef spring rolls were good as well. I was expecting the typical peanut sauce that I love but it was a light, watery sauce that was good as well.   Something unique about this Vietnamese restaurant is there's a bar-like vibe, I think I spotted the alcohol across the room and college basketball was playing on the TVs. The place was also playing American songs (none of the current trendy stuff, but slightly older music), which the BF enjoyed :)",

I had bun with grilled shrimp and chicken, plus veggie spring rolls, and everything was orgasmically delicious, fresh and flavorful. I'm not usually a meat person, but the grilled chicken and shrimp in my bun were out of this world! This chef really knows what he's doing....my understanding is it's one of the sons of the guy who runs Pho So 1, so I guess he came up the ranks and learned his shit from the right people.  My friend had beef pho and hot tea, and the total bill was $27!! And they were BIG portions! Plus, the atmo was modern and chic, and VERY clean (restrooms too).   I will definitely be coming back here again! LOVE IT!!!",

Their pho is one of the best I ever had, spring roll and egg roll are super good! If you come here order the combination pho with meat balls meat on the side ask for extra white onion, the green onion inside the fat soup is super good and try their Thai tea.

And that's the only reason why I am giving it two stars.   But frankly, the service was just \"okay\", and the food was absolutely atrocious. Bordering on inedible. I felt queasy afterwards and the BF was sick. Maybe because it was 3 am on a weeknight and ingredients were running low.... Or, maybe because I'm white and the BF is brown they thought they could pass off the daily leftovers and scraps as \"palatable\" to non-Asians ... but we're both frequent diners of Vietnamese cuisine and we know sub-par when we taste it. The meat tasted slightly foul, like it was just about to go bad. The spring rolls were so horrible I could barely choke them down - vegetables were wilted and clearly not fresh, and again, the meat bordered on rancid.   We were starving however, and it was super late, so we sucked it up too tired and hungry to bother to complain. Yeah, I know we should have said something, but we're introverted vampires. Interacting with people drains our powers. LOL. We didn't finish the spring rolls or our pho - by the way.   Because I have an iron stomach and eat regularly at the Waffle House, I fared better than my boy. Just upset tummy rumbles. He, on the other hand, got to set up camp in the bathroom for a while. The experience was such that we will never be back again. Which is horrible, because, as I said, we are night owls and love to frequent places like this. Maybe we just got unlucky.",

Also it is super crowded there, even worse than college union cafe. There are lots of long table in the middle and lots of guests shard the tables.   We ordered two classic pho, you can choose any topping you want. I would recommend the rare beef. They also did something wrong with the order, they put beef tripe in the soup which we didn't order. I ordered the spicy special vermicelli ? I am not sure what it called. I thought it will be like normal spicy vermicelli in other pho restaurant but not. There are lots of weird beef organs in the soup and I don't like it at all.   But I have to admit their soup base is super super good. Fresh, tasteful and flavorful. Strong and clear taste made me forgive all the errors. Also the portion and beef amount is surprisingly big. Strongly recommend if you are craving for pho at 12 pm.",

I mean I do have too much of it at home but the certain dishes at the Viet Noodle Bar makes me want to go.   I always start off with an order of Thai tea along with egg rolls or spring rolls. I honestly don't order the pho (because how many times have I had that so far in my life?) and I just go straight for the Mi Bo Kho. It's a beef stew with noodles and one of my most favorite dishes. The Bun Rieu (Tomato and crab noodle soup), Bun Bo Nuong (Vermicelli noodles with charbroiled beef), and the Bun Bo Hue (hue styled soup) are good options as well. When I come with my dad, we go for the BBQ combo since it's what he likes the most.   I definitely recommend their dessert called 'Che Ba Mau', layered with sweet beans, fruits, coconut milk, and glutinous rice afterwards. I would say that is how you finish your dinner at the Viet Noodle Bar :-)",

With all the Vietnamese restaurants around, I can't find one that serves the charbroiled pork served with vermicelli , cucumber, lettuce and mints. Yes, everyone has the pork chop, I'm not talking about that, they cook the pork to perfection here and you put everything I listed in rice paper and roll it up, and dip it in your fish sauce .i even YouTube it and tried to make it myself...not quite the same, lol. So when you come to Vegas, this is a must try place!! Enjoy!!",

In fact, I come here often for the food despite the factors that caused me to rate this place 3 stars.  Let's just say service isn't very good. We've been here about 5 times now and the service has always been laggy. They're inconsistent and they take foreverrrr to give the bill. They get easily side tracked and forget the things we ask for all the time! I've worked at a restaurant before so I can tell when the place is organized when they get hit with a rush. They're definitely not because they're always all over the place in these situations.   Besides the service, my complaint would be the booths. They're never clean and we always have to wipe the rice off the seats every time we come in because they just can't clean the booths before seating people in them :/ food is pretty good though!",

This place is ok, there were numerous of things that doing go so well that sadly didn't allow me to rate this place with more stars...  [Environment] This place was alright, the parking was a pain, which took several drive arounds until someone left. Inside is pretty spacious and you are welcomed by a wall of polaroids which I thought was pretty cool. However the polaroids looked over-exposed and washed out. The decor on the walls were pretty nice and entertaining to look at.  [Service] I honestly didn't have good service. I felt like it took a really long time until someone came by just to ask us for drinks. I also noticed 2 other groups who came after us got their drinks ordered before us and it was by the same waitress/waiter too! Not sure why we were neglected...We had several wrong orders and confusion that occurred and the vibe I was feeling from them felt like they really didn't want to be there nor serve us Refills took forever to come and I felt like we had to flag someone down just to get additional service.  [Food] The food wasn't too bad. I ordered the Bun Bo Hue, which didn't seem to be to flavorful, it was a little water'd down and which resulted in lack of flavor. The lemon grass pork lettuce wrap also felt like it was overly cooked and lacked flavor. Even the shrimp paste sauce didn't have a rich flavor to it. Normally it does too! We asked to order beer and I felt like out of the 5 choices of imported beer to choose from, only 1 was available.   Overall, I don't think I will return to this location. I'm not sure if it was because it was prime time or not enough workers, but we felt like we were not wanted there. Hope the best for their future business.  [ See it, Taste it, Yelp it! ]",

The advantage to this place is that the food is of the same caliber but Viet Noodle House offers better service, faster seating, far better parking and a much quieter atmosphere. Parking is a big thing with me. If I can't park close, I'm am so gone. Very nicely decorated and a great staff.  Never did my glass go dry. The Pho was outstanding as well as my shrimp and pork rolls. Yes, I will be back. Consider me a regular now. I love finding places like this that offer more convenience and speedier service.",

Pho joints with long waits is either really goood or the cooks did not make enough pho broth to last until the end of when the shop closes.  Got our table. We waited 30 mins for the waiter to take our order. We had a party of 10. But seems like there was a party of 5 or more everywhere. One bite everyone knows the rules..... 4.2 out of 10. Broth was bland and it was sooo sad, everyone at our table did not eat even a quarter of the pho. Maybe it was the day we went in but if you gonna call your shop Viet Noodle Bar...... you better have better than average pho. Not even subpar.",

It's a pretty fair price and the parking lot is pretty easy to park in.

I used to get the fresh spring rolls at pho so 1, where you grill the beef and roll them yourself at the table. They offer the same thing here. It's still just as yummy but the portion size is way smaller. We used to get 3 times the amount of meat. Very unique and hands on experience. You put whatever veggies you like along with the grilled meat in the rice paper, roll it up and enjoy with an assortment of sauces. I like the peanut sauce they offer best.",

Yay!  When I first walked in the employees seemed to all be eating and taking a break? They kind of looked at me and ignored me for a minute or 2, then someone yelled at them that I was there and they jumped into action. Fortunately after the shaky start the service was actually above average when compared to the average pho restaurant. The server kept checking on me to make sure I was okay and refilled my drink whenever it got low.   The pho is pretty good and I like that they offer size options so I can choose between small and large. The broth was flavorful and the sprouts and other sides available to mix into the pho were fresh. Overall slightly above average and worth a try.",

    "text": "I was only in Vegas for a week, yet I was back at viet noodle bar 3x - that in itself should tell you how good this place is. Honestly, I was just super tired of strip food and needed something comforting, and this place really fit the bill.   Despite the Vegas heat, I ended up ordering the shrimp pho (large) during every single visit. I usually don't like shrimp pho because often times the shrimp in the pho is not very fresh tasting or overcooked or both. AND they usually use some weird seafood or vegan broth without even asking me if I want beef broth, so ordering shrimp pho here the first time was a gamble (but hey, I'm in Vegas, so why not right?). IT WAS AMAZING THOUGH. It hit the spot - the broth was flavorful, but not overly oily/fatty, which is my usual complaint with most pho broths, and the shrimp was abundant (I counted 16 ish) and not overcooked! The charbroiled chicken spring rolls were also really good, especially if you're looking to avoid alllll red meat. I also tried the shrimp egg rolls, which were really good but weren't what I was expecting.. they weren't like typical egg rolls, but more like wrapped shrimp.   Highly recommend trying the fresh coconut beverage if you like coconut water! It comes in an actual coconut and it's like a dessert + healthy drink in one. I'm not a fan of coconut water, but my boyfriend ordered it so I was able to try the white coconut parts you could scrape from the inside of the coconut. It was really good and tasted like haupia! Overall, this place was great for comfort/hangover food (whichever you need lol) and service was brisk, but fast. This is definitely a new Vegas staple for me!",

This joint keeps its doors open until 6 a.m. serving up a full menu each night, drawing in crowds looking for some comfort food.   Got into Vegas around 2am and this spot was one of the few places that's opened late to accommodate the late nighters trickling in for something filling.   Communal style as well as booth seating against the wall. A spacious dining area can accommodate large parties.   Known for their Oxtail Pho so, we had to give it a try! It was light and smooth. No dressing needed as the broth took center stage.   Bun Bo Hue was hearty with mild heat. Tender beef swimming in a rich flavored broth that's enhanced by the freshness of the herbs and brightness of the lime. Although, not the tastiest I've ever had but, it definitely did its job!   Shrimp and Pork spring rolls were mediocre. The peanut sauce tasted generic like Planters peanuts were used instead of the house made roasted peanuts. A pass for me.   Do stop by for food that is not only delicious but, will satisfy your late night cravings!",

    "text": "While I was recovering from EDC, my gf and our friend ran a food mission while I was asleep. What they came back with did NOT disappoint and it was seriously what I needed to get me back into the game for the rest of the weekend.  You could only imagine what type of appetite I had after sleeping for 10-12 hours. That poor plate of rice and BBQ'd pork and skewers didn't stand a chance.  The BBQ pork was perfectly marinated and not too overpowering with lemon grass or sugar. The smokiness and seasonings were all perfectly balanced. Also, keep in mind that this had been sitting around while I was still asleep. I'd imagine it would have been PRIME if I had torn into it while it was still fresh. I couldn't finish it all in one serving. I saved some for later and it was still good as it was earlier.  My friend wasn't able to finish all of his bun bo hue, so I was able to see what it was all about and it did not disappoint one bit. Again, this was when it was lukewarm. I could only imagine how flavorful it would've been fresh.  To be honest I was salivating while typing this review. Reflecting back on that meal is not doing me any good, but it's what I do for my fellow yelpers. Recently my girlfriend and I have discovered some really good places to eat at and I'm *somewhat* a creature of habit. But, knowing myself I'll probably just wind up here.  Actually, yeah. I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in town.",

Over the fifteen years that I have partaken in Pho, in several states and several countries, Viet Noodle Bar in Vegas is on my YAY list. What makes it more exciting is that this noodle house is the city that I live in.  So in my humble opinion what makes their pho superior? Their noodles! We have stepped into a society where we want good noodles and we can taste the difference. Viet Noodle House's noodles  arewhat I noticed first. They are soft, al dente like, quite perfect. There is a big difference on their noodle quality, broth and meat used to make the perfect pho.  The shrimp springs rolls are bomb as well. Some of the best I have eaten in quite sometime. So between the spring rolls and their pho, this place seems to be a perfect pho place!  So now I am spoiled and may not be able to eat pho in Vegas unless I come here. We will see....",

What better way to kick off the \"new year, new me\" bandwagon mentality than with a sparkling 5-star review of my current jam, Vietnamese food.   We're only 15 days into 2019 and I've traversed over into Chinatown for Viet Noodle Bar three times already. It's crazy if you do the math. If I continue at this steady rate, by the end of the year I'd have gone as many times as the number of years your septuagenarian grandma is alive. Crazy.  Sprawling cafeteria space. Wooden accents make it feel cozy. Service is minimal conversation, but sometimes that's the best for people who hate small talk. If you sit in the booth section, they might forget about you so make sure to stare lasers and they'll remember your presence...  My bf and I love the rice plate combo! You have your choice of one, two, or three-items of various charbroiled meats. I recommend the chicken and shrimp. How can something so simple have so much flavor? I've also tried their shrimp pho, both small and large sizes, and they don't skimp out on the beloved crustacean.  It's open almost 24 hours, too. So big yes. You bet I'll be returning for you, Viet Noodle Bar.",

It's definitely my new go to.  Food: 4.5  Pho Tai Chin (Pho with Well Done Flank and Rare Steak): The small arrives in a deceivingly small bowl, but it is chock full of meat. I usually eat more meat than pho noodles but I was full and completely out of pho noodles and I still had enough meat for another person. Enough about the portion, the pho itself was tasty and comparable to the best places in Orange County. The broth was full of beef umami, the well done flank was moist with just the right amount of fat, and the rare steak was tender and cut generously thick.  Mi Xa Xiu (Egg Noodles with Pork): The egg noodles had the right amount of crunch, and the meat (sliced pork and ground pork) were just as generous. Although the broth was flavorful, it was a little too salty for my taste.  Service: 5  The waiters were patient with our questions about the menu. They were also fairly attentive for an Asian restaurant and refilled our waters as needed. I was impressed by the cashier who actually reminded me to double check that my receipt had the correct orders. Lots of Asian places with throw a number at you, and you have no idea what's on that receipt.  Ambiance: 4  It's pretty clean and spacious. My only gripe is that it can get pretty smokey inside since a lot of tables order diy grill dishes that come with a little table grill.",

I always get the pho here. The combination pho is good and not too pricey for the town of Las Vegas. Coming from a Vietnamese person, the flavors, meat and noodles are there - kind of like home made but of course, with the addition of MSG. But really hits the spot after a loooong night out on the strip.  I tried other dishes here (rice dishes and specialty dishes) but found that they make pho the best here.",

    "text": "4.5 stars. Wanted to give five stars for the food but some of the little sauce dishes on the table were oily (i.e. not cleaned well), and they only offer disposable chopsticks.  My Viet friend recommended Viet Noodle Bar as one of the better Vietnamese restaurants in Las Vegas, so I decided to check it out. I am currently transitioning to nights in preparation for a month of night shifts, so I went for my meal at 4PM, when the restaurant was fairly empty. The restaurant itself is quite large and spacious, and is also very clean with dark-colored decor.  Service was prompt and fairly attentive, with multiple water refills. The menu is of a decent size, though I found it amusing that there was a full page of just advertisements. Viet Noodle Bar offers some hotpot/grill items that are more unique in addition to pho, vermicelli, and broken rice dishes.  I opted for oxtail pho on this visit. Even though I love oxtail and have it regularly, this was actually my first time ever having oxtail pho! I took a sip of the broth before adding in the condiments, and it was phenomenal! Lots of flavor, piping hot (just how I like it), and not too oily. You get a decent amount of meat too (three bones in my bowl this time). The bowl itself is fairly large; there is only one size option for oxtail pho. While I missed having cuts like tendon and tripe found in traditional beef pho, the oxtail pho was a very satisfying dish overall. I was expecting the meat to just fall off the bone, but I guess it wasn't cooked quite that long since it took some effort to get all the meat off. I was given a plate, fork, knife, and special sauce to deal with the oxtail. Oxtail pho at $11.95 is several dollars more expensive than normal pho on the menu, but oxtail is usually expensive in the grocery stores too so it's not unreasonable.  Overall, a great dining experience and I'd love to come back and try vermicelli or rice dishes next time!",

    "text": "While on vacation, my family and I ate here last night. We all had various pho bowls, along with spring rolls (Shrimp no pork) and Fried Shrimp rolls. Normally when we eat at Vietnamese restaurants, we would have to add hoisin sauce, along with the hot sauce. That wasn't the case with this restaurant though, because the broth was outstanding. The shrimp spring rolls, along with the shrimp eggroll was some of the best I've ever eaten as well, three different dipping sauces for both were included (Fish sauce, Peanut sauce, along with sweet & spicy). I wish we had a restaurant back in Maryland that had OX TAIL PHO! This particular Pho was so good, that I was tempted to order a second bowl had I not been so satiated! I'm tempted to go back tonight with my family again for the barbecue; we shall see!   p.s. I've read some of the \"So-So\" reviews of this place, and I can tell you, they are far reaching to say the least. My wife has a slight Gluten intolerance, and because the 1st waiter was a \"Little Light\" on his English, he quickly got another server to help decipher what she could and couldn't eat on the menu. Afterwards, every waiter that passed our table, was assisting with mostly every need we MAY HAVE HAD (Because we didn't have any.), and OUR water glasses were never empty. Nor did we have to \"set them on the end of the tables\", as another person here said she normally would do.  I'll finish with, \"IF VACATIONING IN VEGAS? GET THE HELL OFF THE STRIP!

Very pleased with the appearance of this place compared to most Vietnamese food restaurants that I have been to.   Food: The main reason I rated this place a 4/5 was because of the food. everyone with me enjoyed their food and as a Vietnamese person myself in my opinion the food tasted authentic and delicious. I personally got the Bun Bo Hue + Thai Tea. The Thai tea was great and very good size. Bun Bo Hue was also very good and well made. Would definitely recommend this place for those looking for delicious Vietnamese food.",

We were handled very quickly, and the pho came out soon thereafter. All in all, I was very impressed with the food, the service, and the overall character of this place.

First of all, the place smells really nice and clean. We were greeted by 5+ staff members that welcomed us, seated us, cleaned a baby seat for my niece, and brought water/tea right away. Our waiter was so friendly and helpful (his name is Steve) and he was just wonderful! I highly recommend this place and I will never have pho elsewhere!  The shrimp spring rolls are LIFE!!!",

Haven't tried the BBQ grill on the table yet although it looks and smells wonderful - but have tried their egg noodles dry version, BBQ beef and pork rice dishes, lemon grass vermicelli, shrimp paste and pork patties vermicelli, pho and Bun Bo Hue noodle soup. The egg noodles dry version is pretty legit. It's not overlooked and has the perfect texture what a good bowl of egg noodles should be. The soup that comes on the side is on the salty side and doesn't have much flavor of a pork broth. The vermicelli and rice plates are good too. The pho is so-so, I only ordered it for my kids since they love pho. The Bun Bo Hue was a disappointment. Noodles were way over cooked, soup doesn't have much lemon grass flavor and it has too much meat going on in there from tendons to pigs skins to pieces of slices of beef shanks and meat patties like. The pork blood wasn't fresh - has a stinky smell to it and there weren't enough Vietnamese herbs and vegetables that should come with this noodle dish on the side. Let's just say, i would not order this again. Will I be back? For sure for their egg noodles and maybe try out their BBQ grill on the table the next time we are in town.",

When I thought I had finished all the meat I discovered this huge amount at the bottom of the brother.  Will have to try the oxtail pho next time.  Also tried the bbq beef - delicious too.

It's almost like they know that pho so 1 is not very good so they decided to make it better with this place.   The pho broth is rich and meaty. I just wish that the was a bit more cinnamon to give it a bit of a herbal taste.  They are very generous with their meat portions also.   Although the brisket and flank are a bit tough.   Their grilled pork is pretty good,  But I would still have to say the best grilled pork in Las Vegas is the Da Lat.  Also had their grilled beef which you wrap with fresh vegetables and noodles with rice paper. unlike the salon and other places there grilled beef was so flavorful and tender. That was quite a surprise. and they give you woven noodles.  Definitely try this with both the fish sauce and then the anchovy sauce. The anchovy sauce smells like dead shrimp and dead anchovies were buried together in 1912 and found in the desert in July of 2015. But somehow it's still delicious.  This is a great option if you want low-carb.  Service here is fast like Pho So  1 but more friendly and attentive.",

    "text": "My Go-To for Pho in Vegas. Located on Spring Mountain (near Chinatown) where you find most of the decent Pho in this town. If you know me, you know how much i love Pho. And how I'm a pretty big Pho snob (I've tried it all). That being said, this place is pretty amazing. Robust broth, tender meat, the noodles have perfect texture and fresh-fragrant ingredients. It's the best thing on a gloomy day or any day of the week imo.   I usually order the same thing every time: #1 Cha Gio (crispy egg rolls) served with big leafy greens not the sad wilted lettuce you'll find at other restaurants.  #9 Pho Tai large (rare steak) usually the difference between large and small at most places isn't very noticeable but it is here. If you don't want to leave on an empty stomach, opt for the large bowl.  And Hot tea - it's good for the soul and cold water is served automatically.   The Charbroiled Pork Spring Rolls, Ox-tail pho and Bun Bo Hue are all solid choices. Another notable mention is the service. Unlike most Vietnamese restaurants where you order your food, you receive your food, then never see your waiter again; Viet Noodle Bar really stands out for their service. It's one of the many reasons I keep coming back. The staff is friendly and attentive. My water glass is refilled without asking, i get extra napkins when needed, they always come back to see if you need anything else. Much appreciated.",

So based on the reviews on Yelp, we picked this one. Their pho was so pho-king amazing...please excuse my language. I'm vegetarian so I got the vegetable pho...best vegetarian pho ever!!! I used to eat meat, so I know what non-vegetarian pho tastes like as well. The vegetables were crisp, the broth was piping hot...add a dash of sriracha sauce and hoisin sauce and I was in Pho heaven. Mmmm, I'm craving pho right now...but it's almost midnight. The size \"small\" was actually a good size for me...the portion was like a normal sized bowl that a normal sized person would eat.The large would've been too much food for me. I had to look good in my little black dress that evening, know what I mean?   I'll be in Vegas again next weekend with my friend...we'll definitely stop by here. Two thumbs up...5 stars. I would move to Vegas just to eat here...but then again, the summers are brutal there, so nevermind. K, bye.",

We ordered 2 pho, one with tai bo vien, and one with nam bo vien. Broth is very delicious. We also ordered the eggroll (the crunchy one) and the spring roll (the fresh one). The egg  rolls are good. The spring rolls are okay, it could be better. I just don't like the dipping sauce, it's a bit too sweet and there's a weird smell, not like a stinky smell but it doesn't go with the sauce. Maybe they do an updated version and it's different from authentic version? Maybe someone likes it, but not me, I like it authentic! (and I'm Vietnamese, if that helps)",

After looking at a few places I decided to go with the ratings and reviews that I had seen previously. People had it spot on.  My vegetarian friend went ahead and started off with the spring rolls. Pretty tasty. Very fresh. Everything came together really well. We gave them a five out of five. You can always find vegetarian dishes at Thai places but the freshness and the care that went into putting these together definitely reflected in the taste. 5/5  I went with the shrimp eggrolls. Nothing over-the-top fancy about these but simple is elegant. Whole shrimp wrapped in an eggroll wrapper deep fried and served up with a traditional sweet-and-sour sauce. Add a little soy sauce to the sauce and it hit perfectly. Also 5/5.  Now for the fun stuff. Once again my vegetarian friend went ahead and decided to get the vegetarian option for the pho. The noodles were amazing. They have the amount of vegetables topped off the plate, with a side of Thai basil and sprouts. The broth had a great flavor as well. Also a 5/5.  I went ahead with the chicken wonton variation. I'm a huge fan of wontons and soup dumplings and these were pretty good. Pho restaurants aren't typically known for their wontons and these weren't the best ever but still pretty good. The chicken stock or broth was very flavorful and the portions were pretty big. We had gone with the regular sizes instead of the large sizes and we were glad we did. I also gave us a five out of five.  Overall the place is extremely clean and the staff was very attentive, friendly, and eager to help out with any choices you have.",

There's a crap ton of pho shops littered on Spring Mtn but this place has a hold on me and the fam.   The hours are great, 9a-6am this is awesome I don't worry everrr if there closed.  The restaurant location is ideal, it's in a strip mall on top of the Spring Mtn hill, parking is easy you don't have to compete for parking. Inside is clean, plenty of seating to accommodate large groups and booth seating is a nice touch.  The Pho: It's incredibly flavorful, the clarity of the soup is redic..gets my man every time. They're very generous with meats and toppings, and just plain great pho.  Some of my other favorites are the Banh Xeo, it's freaking huge you can definitely share but I don't. It takes awhile to prepare so be aware..it is worth the wait my friend. Bun bo hue, vermicelli noodle salad with beef/shrimp is bomb bomb.   Nothing bad I can say about this place, aside from time to time they'll run out of select entrees and during holidays this place gets nuts like the rest of Chinatown.  5 thumbs up, my dudes.",

I'm not sure what the sign in sheet is for, because they seated people who signed in after us. Also, we were waiting in the little waiting area for 10 minutes before we finally just asked someone if we could sit down.   Finally at a table, waiters walked everywhere near us, but nobody actually came to our table. My mom had to flag a guy down to take our order. (2 orders of fried egg rolls, chicken pho, Vietnamese coffee and a Thai tea) The waiter got our egg roll order wrong.   Not once did anyone come by our table to ask if we needed more water, coffee or tea. I had to ask for the check. It was really ridiculous, and quite frustrating.  Now the good stuff.... the food so yummy!! The pho broth had so much flavor, and the bowls were HUGE!! Also, when the correct Order of egg rolls came out they were delicious - the food made the waiting and flagging down not so bad.",

We ordered the combination pho and vermicelli with egg rolls. I had a spoonful of the combination pho which was great. The broth was flavorful! I loved the vermicelli - veggies were fresh and egg rolls were crisp and amazing! The portions are very generous. The food came out really fast too, maybe within 10 minutes or less! Service is great. Parking is right outside in the lot and free. Highly recommend this place if you're craving pho!",

My order turned out just perfect however his vermicelli looks more like salad to me. I thought it was overwhelmingly filled with greens than the noodles but that's just me though. Also, I've had better fried eggrolls but it was still good.   The restaurant was pretty spacious but I think they get pretty busy on certain hours. So I recommend giving them a call regarding wait time if your coming in with a large group.   Husband also ordered their thai iced tea, he said it's very creamy and not too think which he prefers. I would definitely try their other drinks on my next visit.   Service is quite exceptional as well. Food came out quick and our server was very attentive.   I'll definitely come back and recommend my  friends to check this place out.",

Had 5 pieces Oxtail, mostly fall off the bone. Lots of noodles too. This Pho and Oxtail meat is the best I've ever had. The broth was clear and tasty.   Both dishes had an excellent balance of flavors. No spice or ingredient was dominant in either dish. All the food just blended together for wonderful meals.

No sane person wants fast food after a night of drinking alcohol lol.  She got pho and I ordered beef/broccoli with steamed rice, #40.  She is really particular and didn't seem to enjoy the pho compared to the other spot we go to.  My food on the other hand I liked way better.  I feel like the other place's food is more bland whereas Viet Noodle makes sure to season your food.  If you are one to savour the flavour then come here because they have it!  However, you have a sensitive stomach then I'd try elsewhere.  Customer service was good and the food came out in a timely manner.  It was around 3:30 a.m. on a Saturday night \"Sunday morning\" and there were still a decent amount of people inside so obviously we weren't the only ones with the idea.  The food was satisfying and I felt full afterwards.",

We did wait a little while to receive our food after placing our order, but it wasn't a ridiculous long wait.  Once we received our food, we dug in. The broth is significantly better than the other pho places I have tried in Vegas (please note that the pho places I tried were not in Chinatown. I know I need to try pho places over there.)

    "text": "My friends wanted pho so we decided to go for Viet Noodle Bar due to the high reviews on Yelp.   I only eat Viet food in Socal, so I wasn't too sure what to expect. I was a little skeptical since we were in Vegas. Our group of 9 came at 12 PM on a Monday. It was fairly busy, but not too bad. They do have a wide variety of Vietnamese food, but their portions are huge, which means prices were higher. I prefer smaller portions and lower prices.   l Our Order |  Cha Gio ($7) - 4 pieces of egg-rolls with pork and vegetables. My friends said that this was a good appetizer. You can't go wrong with egg-rolls.   Pho Bo ($9) - Beef noodle soup with the following meats: brisket, tripe, flank, tendon, fatty flank, or rare steak. All of my friends said that their pho was just okay, very mediocre, nothing unique.   Bun Bo Hue ($11) - Hue style noodle soup with a side of vegetable dish. Based on the color of the soup, you can tell it's a lot of coloring. It didn't look that appetizing to me, lacking in flavor.   Banh Canh Hai Vi ($11) - Seafood udon noodles with shrimp, squid, fish, and fishball. My friend said it wasn't bad, but she had better.   Com Bo Luc Lac ($14) - Steamed rice with store fried filet mignon. My friend enjoyed this dish.   Bo Nuong La Lot ($15) - Grilled beef in betel leaf with woven vermicelli. This portion is so big, it's meant for 2 people to share. The beef was way too dry and not juicy. We did not enjoy it at all.   Overall, the presentation of their food is nice, but portions are too much for one person to finish. The quality is not really there and service was pretty slow. Prices are quiet expensive compared to your average Vietnamese restaurant.",

    "text": "This place is probably my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas. I haven't found another place that tops it but haven't ventured out to find other Vietnamese restaurants either.   Last time I was there, my wife and I ordered 3 dishes.  1. #1 Egg Rolls : the egg rolls here are on point. They cook it to a golden crispy perfection. Paired with the wide assortment of vegetables and fish sauce. Can't say I went here without having this dish as an appetizer. *****  2. #10 Oxtail Pho : this is probably in my top 5 pho I've had and I've had a lot of Pho in many different cities around the world. I prefer this dish over the other standard pho like the dac biet which is what I usually order elsewhere but since they have the oxtail, I'm aleays ordering this. I like how the oxtail creates a slightly oily but rich flavor in the broth and noodles are always cooked to perfection. *****  3. #53 Beef BBQ : this was ordered on a recommendation from the waiter but we meant to order the #56 which should have been more than enough food. This dish is a cook your own beef dish where they bring out a grill and you cook the beef at the table. The beef tastes similar to Korean bulgogi but comes with a plate of lettuce, sprouts, carrots, few other leafy greens and rice paper to wrap it in. The flavors are good and portion size is decent for the price. ****  The service is great here. They don't bother you every 5 minutes to check to see how you are doing which I personally don't like during a meal. If you need something they are prompt with your request.   As far as ambiance, there really isn't one. It's just a noisy restaurant with TVs all over the place but nonetheless I enjoy going here to get my Vietnamese food fix.",

    "text": "wow, definitely some of the Best Pho I have had in a while. Viet Noodle Bar has an wide Vietnamese menu expanding from rice plates to Pho and appetizers.   We came here for a late lunch and we came away impressed and full. Their pho is very reasonable priced along with the rice plates. My friends ordered the oxtail pho while I ordered the combo pho with four meats. The restaurant does not hold back from piling on the noodles and the meats in the bowl of soup. For an entree under $10, I struggled to finish every last bite of my flavorful Pho. The broth had a clean finish as it was not too oily. The beef flavor along with all the cilantro and greens were a perfect combination.   Service was good. The service started out very well but then gradually tapered off. It's still better service than most Asian restaurants though. The restaurant dining area is spacious and clean and it has an inviting atmosphere to it. I can now understand why Viet Noodle Bar is one of the highest rated Vietnamese restaurants in the Las Vegas area.",

Literally just got off the plane and wanted Vietnamese food and I am SO happy we came here.   Whether you get the broken rice or vermicelli, I definitely recommend getting the charbroiled pork. The meat was so tender and flavorful. I'm so full right now but I could go for another bowl it was that good.   Solid 5 star. All the food my friends and I ordered was delicious. The service was fast and friendly and we didn't have to ask extra of anything because they gave us more than enough sauce to begin with.  If you're thinking you want Vietnamese food, just come here! You won't regret it.",

I don't normally eat pho out, but it was so good I didn't need to add but a drop of hoisin, which prematurely added before tasting broth alone. It was just perfect!!! Of course I added all the herbs but honestly, not too salty or aromatic with spices or bitter from cooking/simmering too long! I ate the entire gigantic bowl. The beef was extremely tender. I'm never really in the mood to eat Vietnamese outside of my home but I will say this place has yet to let me down. And it's great for late night eats!",

We had the small rare steak and a flank ph which were both incredible.  The rare steak had a complex, flavorful broth while the flank tasted like there's a wizard in the kitchen, letting magical soup simmer for hours with the right amount of stock, fat, and ingredients.    We also ordered the gi cun which was fantastic on its own, but complemented an already amazing post-bar dinner.  Highly recommended.",

After they brought us our food no one came to refill drinks we waited about an hour and still no one came until I asked for the check. A Hispanic server came and try to make excuses saying they were busy but they had about 6 tables in the whole restaurant, I let him know what the problem was and my son even ask for a manager and no one came.  We love the food but don't think we will be back they didn't seem to care about our business.....",

Vermicilli with pork and eggrolls $10.95: husband loved it, eggrolls were big and crispy.  My brother got their Pho Dac Biet with an extra side of meatballs ($2.50)- tastes similar to any other pho places.

Usually not a wait when we come, I believe during busier time you would have to write down names on the clipboard when you walk in the front.  I love it's always been clean when we come here.  Service is quick.  The gentlemen tonight who checked us out was really nice and smiling, he asked us how was our food and if we had any issues.  That's nice, usually nowadays people don't even bother.  We've tried their:  Small Beef Salad (Citrusy with the lime and vinegar, nicely done, new for us and we're a fan) Egg Rolls (Not bad, we enjoyed it) Com Tam Charbroiled Short Rib (A MUST, I crave this from time to time here!) Com Bo Lua Luc (Good, husband and I preferred the Charbroiled Short Rib better) Pho Dac Biet (Decent, better than most places in LV) Bun Rieu (Everywhere makes this dish a little different, I liked it) Mi Wonton (Clean, light, hit the spot for late night)  Another positive thing is the vegetables are always fresh here.  We never had bad or ok condition.  Looking forward to come back to try a different rice dish. =)  Credit cards ok for over $15.  Vietnamese places are usually cash only back in California, so I'm used to this.",

My friend wanted to get the oxtail pho, however they ran out (minus one star).   Service was super slow even though there was not many people in the restaurant. It took us a while to flag the waiters down, order, get our bill, etc. Very disappointing because they took forever (minus one star).   Portions were okay sized, broth was flavorful. Great prices, but they really need to work on their service!",

I tried both their mixed and filet pho. It arrived super fast. Their Thai tea and hot tea were so good though. The reason they didn't score higher with me was with the lack of service. Make sure you ask for everything up front because you're going to have a hard time getting the staff to stop for anything else you might need. I heard they also get super packed at dinner time. I went during lunch and it was much slower. All in all not a bad place.",

It could have used a bit more beef brisket in the large bowl.  The chicken wings appetizer was well prepared and tasty.  We also ordered steamed rice with grill pork chop and grill shrimp.  The meats were both seasoned nicely and were tender.  We really enjoyed our meal.    The only really odd thing was the music.   They were playing post-grunge Rock and it was very out of place in a Vietnamese restaurant.  The volume was high enough that you could not ignore it.   I don't mind the music genre but it just was quite odd in this venue.     If you want a good bowl of pho in a clean place, this will do the job.",

Ambiance is shinied up mom and pop with a modern twist.   We ordered the beef salad and beef pho with everything in it. Everything was flavorful and fresh.  Might the best beef pho broth I've ever had. I was extra happy that the basil accompanying the pho was high quality (sometimes the leaves come out looking wilted and spotty).   Definitely looking forward to coming back to try more dishes on the menu. I'm especially interested in the desserts they keep in a refrigerated case near the cashier.",

    "text": "The #53 Bo Nuong Vi/Nhung Dam aka \"Beef BBQ or Vinegar Hotpot\" for  $28.95 is delicious and plenty for 2 people. This item requires self cooking like KBBQ and can be a fun way to learn or show off your spring roll wrapping skills.  This comes with a plate filled with thin slices of raw beef marinated in garlic, a set of small spring roll wrappers, and a plate filled with various veggies including mints, basil, fermented radish/carrots, cucumbers, and bean sprouts. Two types of dipping sauce is provided: fish sauce, and some type of shrimp paste. The paste is a bit too thick and strong in flavor for me. I prefer to use fish sauce and add a heavy scoop of chili into it.   The Thai ice tea is pretty good, but can be on the sweet side.   The service was awesome. Servers were friendly and quick to help. We came on a Thursday night and the place was filled but did not have a wait.   The restaurant is located at the entrance of a plaza, and I never seem to have trouble parking. However there aren't many spots because it is shared with other businesses.   Will come back here in the future",

We ordered the beef cubes (filet), pho, and another rice dish with beef and shrimp (grilled). The spring rolls with charboiled pork were so flavorful! We normally do fried spring rolls, but wanted to try the charboiled, and it was the right choice!  Pho was good - I've been craving pho and it hit the spot - they gave me a lot of meat. Couldn't finish it. The beef cubes were a bit on the salty side. Do not get the rice dish with choice of meat - they're literally just grilled. We didn't like that at all.  Iced coffee was amazing.",

    "text": "This place is poppin'! Is that what the cool kids say these days? Whatever, I said it! This place was pretty cool. Now I feel like an old nerd. Let's move on.  I'm always on the hunt for a good Pho place and luckily one of my best girlfriends is also a Pho addict, so we try to hit new spots all the time. We were in this area and I saw this place on Yelp! so off we went. It was midday on a Sunday and it was crowded AF. There was an actual wait list and a guy running back and forth, calling out names, clearing tables. I was like \"Yeah! This is going to be good.\" Also, we were literally the only non Asians in the joint, so I knew we had found a good spot(I love you, Asians and all your delicious foods!)  After we were seated, the waitress took our drink order super quickly and came back with our beverages in a flash. I usually order water but that day I had a coke as well. I will say that the Coke here sucked. It was like totally the Coke that is running out of syrup and is more watered down. Not impressed,  but I'll give them a pass.  I ordered chicken Pho and my friend ordered vegetable Pho. We split the shrimp egg rolls. Shrimp egg rolls were good but they didn't clean the shrimp, so...shrimp poop. I can also look beyond that because the Pho was damn good. The broth was nice and light, plenty of noodles and chicken. They top it with the standard green onions and cilantro. All in all, quite enjoyable. Would definitely come back again.  I do have a funny note to add from when we paid our check(we usually split it). I finished signing and the waiter brought over my friend's check and he looked at me and said very sternly \"Give her the pen!\" I was like \"whoa!\" I have a pretty good sense of humor, so as soon as he was out of sight we busted up laughing. No sugarcoating, no pen stealing.   Looking forward to coming back and trying more items from their menu.",

There are double entrances. I supposed they keep the hot air out on a hot day. The sitting area and atmosphere are awesome.  My pho was OK. The broth was bland. Service was good however the waiter got my drink order wrong. I wanted the Logan drink but I received the lotus dessert drink. In general, since this is in Las Vegas, the higher than normal menu prices are expected. Minus 2 stars. By the time we finished lunch, the outside temperature was going up to the high 90s. I would definitely come back after trying out the many new nearby Asian food places.",

I like how the parking lot isn't as congested as Pho Kim Longs lot. I also liked the atmosphere at this restaurant a lot better. They had a few booths and cute decorations. Also, it didn't seem as hectic.  My food stayed hot all the way home, even after my detour to Lees. I'm glad they wrapped the soup container in a bag because my container top had a small cut so a little bit of soup spilled out. No big deal.  5/5 for the bun bo hue! Not as good as the ones in Orange County, but I'm pretty sure it's one of the best ones in vegas!  broth was flavorful with a ton of meat. I think the only downside is that they didn't give enough noodles.  3/5 for the bun rieu. The broth wasn't as good because it was definitely lacking some tomatoes. The meat that they used was ground up pork and crab or something. I wasnt a huge fan of it. Also, the tofu was a bit hard. I did like how they put fried onion on the noodles.",

    "text": "I was SO excited to try Viet Noodle Bar. All of the good reviews and pictures had me jumping out of my seat waiting to try it! I was excited to see what all the hype was about. So we decided to try it out instead of our usual spot. When we got there it was a little busy which is no big deal, we don't mind a wait for really good food. So we waited about 5 minutes, and then the server told us there was a booth thats available. We started walking there and all of the sudden another server popped up right as we got there and said \"No! This is for someone else\" it was very loud and I mean i don't care about a booth anyways but do you need to be so loud about it?  Anyways we got seated at an awkward table meant for 4. Thats fine, we just wanted our pho! We got the calamari for an appetizer because I love calamari. I neveeeer pass it up. I also ordered the beef flank pho, and my boyfriend got the brisket pho.  The Calamari was OK, nothing special about it. Nice flavor, and I liked the dipping sauce.  Now, for the pho. We didnt get any toppings to add to the pho which kind of surprised us, we're used to bean sprouts, basil, lime, jalapeno....etc. But okay, we can live without it! The brisket pho my boyfriend got was great, he loved it. MY pho however....was a different story. It started off great, but I soon noticed all I had was FAT. Literally. All fat, no meat. I didnt order their fatty flank. I ordered FLANK. So it's very very disappointing to find a legit pile of fat in my pho. I included a picture of the fat i picked out for proof, and that wasn't all the fat. There was more in the bowl but it was so gross I couldn't finish the dish. The sad part too was that their portions are incredibly small! We're used to huge portions from other pho places. Honestly I was just sooo sad. On top of that it seems like our server forgot about us. We were left alone not being checked on, or asked of we were ready for a check for what seemed like FOREVER. There was a table behind us with a group of people that got there after us, ate their food, and ended up leaving BEFORE us. We were so annoyed we eventually tracked down another server who kindly helped us out and grabbed our check for us.  If the service was great and outstanding, we would have come back to give this place another shot. But the combo of disappointing food and bad service left us wanting to never come back here again.",

My friend was going to order pho, but since they put msg in a lot of their foods, he declined.  I don't care about msg, so I got the wonton egg noodle soup.  The dish was a touch salty, but otherwise, quite good.  Noodles were AL dent and wontons were flavorful.  7.5/10.  Husband got a MI xao with seafood.  I thought it was oddly sweet, but They did gave him a lot of Meats and veggies.  5/10.  My friend got the Lotus root salad , but even the nuoc mam was sugary. 6/10.  I've never seen this dish messed up.  Same thing with the peanut sauce for the goi cuon.  So I guess that was the running theme for the meal...which is funny, b/c viet food is not supposed to be sweet at all.  My aunties are always criticizing food based on how fatty or sweet it is.  Given that I never pay this much for viet food and how subpar the items I tried were, there's no need for me to return.",

My first test of every Vietnamese restaurant I visit is to order the pho tai noodle soup. I figure if they get that right, then I'll come back to try other things. So I ordered the soup and the fried egg rolls (cha gio). The egg rolls came first with a plate of fresh vegetables and pickled radish and carrots. Egg rolls were delicious, crisp and piping hot. Then came the soup. The pho tai was a large portion, with lots of sliced, tender beef and noodles in an amazingly flavorful broth.   Because of that first visit, I went back and tried the oxtail pho and my husband got the bun with grilled chicken and pork. It was also amazing. I will go there again and again. I highly recommend this place!",

We ordered the pho dac biet, vermicelli with egg roll and thit nuong, and wonton noodle soup. I thought the display of food was nicely organized, but overall I thought the taste was alright. The pho wasn't really exceptional and I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked. The vermicelli was okay too, the egg roll was very crispy and I thought nicely done. The thit nuong was more lemongrass flavored and not the same authentic taste that I'm used to having. The wonton soup was alright too. Overall the staff seemed friendly and food came out really quick.",

I feel like we waiting a bit long to receive our food almost 15 minutes. My girls pho tasted great but when it came to my soup my chicken tasted like it had been freezer burned and over cooked causing a very dry and unpleasing noodle soup.   Im sure this place has great food but I was unsatisfied with my experience.    The place looks clean and well kept.  I would probably give it another shot when im back In town at a later time.",

    "text": "Hot diggity damn! Vegas + Vietnamese food...who would ever thought it'd be possible to find such a pair matched in such an amazing matrimony? Viet Noodle Bar totally resets my expectation for what the culinary heaven in the Sin City is capable of. As  True Yelper, I listened to the past Yelp gurus who found this place and took a group of my fellow foodies there on our culinary pilgrimage in search of the food world beyond the strip. And I'm so glad we did. For appetizer, we ordered #56--a spring roll making kit with charbroiled pork (can't recall or pronounce the name, sorry)--as well as some spring rolls with beef on the side. And let me tell you. When they say charbroiled, they mean it. I loved every single bite of that charbroiled pork since it was flavored perfectly and carried such an awesome aroma of smoked goodness. The vegetables were also very fresh and good for fooling me into thinking my waistline won't be popping out after my trip. As for the main orders, I got a large bowl of pho with rib eye and my friends got the pho dac biet and pho with ox-tail. The meat portion that I got for my pho was really generous. In fact, it might've been the most meat I've ever gotten at a Vietnamese place overall. Since I always get my raw meat on the side to flash cook it right before I eat, it was pretty satisfying to see the pile of meat of that size. The broth didn't carry as much flavor as I had hoped, but I liked the bite that it came with. And let's not forget about the Vietnamese coffee. After a night with 4 hours of sleep, that cup of yumminess was the liquid fuel that helped to keep me awake. I loved thick blend of the sweet and bitter flavors that accompanied with each sip. Next time I get a craving for pho in Vegas, you can count on me to be there with my huge appetite.",

Served with the usuals: romaine lettuce, various fresh herbs, pickled daikon and carrots, and cucumbers. This dish also came with rice paper to make your own rolls. Plus, their fish and anchovy sauces. Amazingly delicious and a great interactive dish. You dip the rice paper in a bowl of hot water for just a bit to get it pliable and build whatever you want. I loved putting every component in it with a touch of Sriracha; perfection. The ground beef patty in betel leaf was so flavorful. I loved everything!  #59 Banh Xeo ($10.95): Vietnamese Crepe filled with shrimp, meats, and lots of vegetables including bean sprouts. I've had crepes very similar to this in Thailand, so definitely already a fan. It also comes with romaine lettuce, various fresh herbs, pickled daikon and carrots, and cucumbers. The crepe is more egg-like and very thin and crispy. I don't really care for the uncooked bean sprouts, but otherwise, great dish and low-carb!  #37 Com (Rice) comes with 1 item ($8.95), 2 items ($10.95), or 3 items ($12.95). We opted for three items: Suon Nuong (Pork Chop), Bo Nuong (Charbroiled Beef), and Tom Nuong (Charbroiled Shrimp). I absolutely love rice. Especially Jasmine rice. I'll eat it as much as I can get it. The meats were all very packed with flavor and so delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish and would eat it every day. The second time I ordered this dish, I got the Charbroiled Short Rib instead of the Beef (it tastes very similar to Korean Kalbi).  #62 Goi Ngo Sen Tom Thit (Sm, $7.95): Lotus Root Salad with shrimp and pork; dressed with fish sauce. The salad has a nice balance of textures with the same great vegetables and herbs available on most dishes.  There are still other Vietnamese specialties I'm eager to try and I've really enjoyed everything, so I'm definitely visiting again soon!",

I was feeling sleepy and this thing woke me up on first sip. They are also very generous with the condensed milk -pork shrimp spring roll and thit nuong were less than stellar. I would not recommend -pho however had a sweet broth taste and they were generous with the meat portions. I would recommend this not only for cost, portion but also how fast it comes out",

The menu is largely the same as the other vietnamese places in town: pho, com dishes, bun dishes, and a few hot pots.  I ordered the Bun Bo Hue, and the broth was very good, and they had pork blood, which was good, but the meet was not pig foot, so not too authentic there. That said, that is probably a plus for most people in las vegas.   If they added Bun cha Ha Noi, or Cha ca la vong, or some other northern dishes that I love, I would have given 4.5 to 5 stars.",

Bowls come with up to 3 choices of meat from a menu of about 8, plus beef balls if wanted(which I totally did). I think my bowl barely had any broth in it from all the meat orders, but certainly worth it. This place certainly didn't skimp out on the meat. Coming back when I'm craving for some Viet noodles!",

The soup was flavorful and just perfect, the meat was generous and fell right off the bone (wasn't too chewy like some others I've had), and the noodles were right. I hardly used any sauce (hoisin + Sriracha) because it was just so good on its own.  Also tried the \"hot pot\" aka DIY spring rolls with the beef. They bring out all the ingredients, a grill, and the meat and you grill the meat and assemble your own spring rolls. Everything was great and there was plenty of meat in that one order and they can refill the veggies or wraps if you run out for free. The only thing I felt like I was missing was the perfect spring roll sauce-wasn't too crazy about the ones they brought out with it.   Otherwise, great Vietnamese food, especially the pho, and nice experience without the long waits of other places in Vegas.",

I really like a simple bowl of pho ga to use it as a gauge to see if this is a legit pho restaurant.  This is a legit pho spot.  It's not the typical hole in the wall type restaurant, in fact, this is one of the cleaner Vietnamese restaurant I've been too.  The broth was flavorful and they serve the chicken meat skinless (how I want it served) and shredded.  The shrimp eggroll was also a simple and good dish enjoyed with a thai sweet/sour dipping sauce.    The restaurant is situated in a little strip mall and parking seemed small (we used Lyft to get here).  The wait staff was attentive and took our order promptly when we are ready.  We sat next to cash register where people pay and we heard the person handling the cash register asked how people enjoyed their meal and if they needed anything.  This person also came to filled up our water for us which was nice. All the wait staff was cool.  I would recommend checking this spot out for some pho!",

There was an abundance of beef and order the large if you're SUPER hungry! It's HUGE! Otherwise a small is the perfect sized bowl. We will definitely return!!",

I loved the way the menu was kinda like make your own. Whether you wanted rice or noodles they will make it exactly the way you want it. Had vermicelli with beef and egg rolls. Visually the food looked great and tasted just as good. The beef was thin enough and tender. The fish sauce was also quality not too sweet. The portions were great too. Enough to fill most people up. Would recommend this place to anyone! First Viet food in Las Vegas lived up to the good yelp reviews.",

I've tried their pho, bun rieu, bun bo hue, banh canh cua, bo kho and haven't been disappointed in any of them. This is one of the few late night places that I genuinely love and would recommend to anyone. Even most of the servers are nice and quick to respond. I did have one run in with a very rude server but it happens to everyone once in a while. Overall this is a great Vietnamese restaurant and in my top 10 in Vegas",

Loved the taste and the portion size. We couldn't finish either dish and we had to assure the waiter that the food was good, we just couldn't finish! The Vietnamese ice coffee was yummy too. I did order a che ba mau (three colored dessert) but they aren't fully stocked just yet and it wasn't available. The menu is pretty extensive and we didn't get to try a lot obviously.. But I'm excited to go back!  The decor is cool too. Very clean and modern. Felt like a contemporary clean restaurant with very authentic flavors. Glad I found this place!",

Chicken porridge: 5/5 I would highly recommend this if you wanted something that soothes a sickness or cures a hangover. Or if you just wanted something warm. Be sure to mix it up well so the juices from the chicken mixes with the rice and gives it more flavor. The garnishes on top also went well with the porridge.   Crispy egg noodle with beef and vegetable stir fry: 4/5 the noodles were light and crispy, but it felt very fattening to eat since the noodles were deep fried and not just pan fried til it was crispy. The sauce complemented the beef and vegetables well. The beef was thinly sliced like the kind of meat you find in pho tai",

They give you a huge portion of meat, nicely seasoned/marinated, for a very reasonable price. The pho is really good too. Again huge portions. The service is fast and efficient. The only reason I'm giving leas than 5 stars is because the place was pretty smoky from the meats being grilled at the tables. They need a better ventilation system. Overall, this place is great though, and I'll definitely be back.",

I've been to plenty of pho restaurants in Vegas and most prices for a large bowl of pho is between $8 or so. It was about $10 but it didn't really have lots of noodles or meat. Looks more like a medium than a large bowl. I might go back again if they actually fill the bowl with more noodles than broth. I mean this place is still really good because they have other food there that are good too.",

And who would have thought the Las Vegas version of Chinatown would have such a wonderful restaurant.  Hell, who would have though Vegas would have a Chinatown?    Very large restaurant in one of the many strip malls lining Spring Mt. Rd.  Mostly community seating with a few booths in the back.  And packed for a Wednesday night.  Two very good spring rolls with char-broiled beef - not too crispy no too dry and nice flavors.  Then on to the main course - The Phan Banh Hoi - huge plate with vermicelli, sliced shrimp with a bean curd crust and enough salad for a large family of rabbits.  Wonderfully thing rice paper sheets to roll your own wraps.  Great flavors from all the ingredients and a great way to roll the wraps for any individual taste (me - not a big fan of cucumber).  A wonderful alternative to the Pho.  And a few special mentions - very nice, friendly and efficient staff.  Especially when explaining how to put everything together (did I mention this was my first time eating this type of dish).  There I am sitting with really good stuff in front of me and absolutely no clue why there is a giant salad and big bowl of hot water.  Two waiters were extremely patient in curing me of my ignorance.  Almost a pro now.  And finally - Pleasant and hot jasmine tea; from a large urn, not a tea bag in site.",

Our server was attentive and answered my questions with a smile on her face.   The menu was probably my favorite part. You can get an XL pho or banh xeo or banh hoi... etc.!   My boyfriend loves pho but at other restaurants I am always left with just two choices - bun or com. But this place put the excitement back into Vietnamese cuisine for me. So many options! We are actually going back again today!   Just a note - my boyfriend judges good pho by the way the restaurant cuts their lime. They cut it perfectly and in the right direction, maximizing the lime juice.   Give it a try, you won't regret it :).",

I'm excited to see what type of desserts they will be serving along with their delicious food. Restaurant is very spacious and modern, a great place to grab a bite with friends and family. I found out that they will be opened from 9am-2am daily perfect for after a long day at work or a night out. For sure will be coming here very often.",

I was immediately tempted to dine in since my family and I were a little hungry. As we walked in, we were greeted by the working servers with warm smiles. The ambience was simplistic and modern. We felt welcomed right away so we seated ourselves to the nearest open table. As we were just getting settled into our seats, one of the servers quickly handed us menus. The menu descriptions were easy to read and understand.  I ordered shrimp egg rolls as our appetizer and spicy Bun Bo Hue soup as my entree. My husband had the charbroiled pork chop that was to die for.  It was perfectly cooked and marinated. I have to say I had more than a bite of his food. My son had the charbroiled chicken which was just as delicious. I definitely recommend all those dishes. I also tried their fresh coconut juice. It was very refreshing! Perfect for Vegas heat. We found our new favorite restaurant.",

We started with a calamari appetizer that was awful as well.  Tasted like it came out of a frozen bag.  I expected Thai style calamari.

But the service was a bit slow, maybe they were understaffed but it took awhile to put our order in ( food came out fast actually) but we ordered take-out also and after they brought us the bill (which was a wait also) we waited another 20mins for the take-out order. Which I think they forgot about because they came up to is after to check if we had gotten it yet:( so this is probably the best Pho in town so far that I've tried.  Oxtail pho is the best oxtail soup I've had up here in Vegas. Yea it's pho style so don't expect the usual toppings like peanuts, ginger & cilantro. But man, oh man, the meat just fell off the bone, the broth was perfect and the noodles were a bonus in this soup. So id say it's worth the wait.",

Service is fast and accommodating. This is our new Pho place when visiting Las Vegas. Use to go to Pho Kim Long all the time because that seemed to be the spot if you wanted Pho, but that place is mediocre at best and service is so slow there.  Try this place. You won't regret it. Just a little ways down the street from Chinatown.",

It took me quite a while to come back here and write my review because I wanted to try out other traditional viet restaurants and see which one I liked the best and this one is by far the finest. When it comes to service, they're always prompt and attentive. The prices are really affordable and reasonable. And when it comes to food, always super tasty! Interior is nice, cozy, and really inviting. Plus they also deliver which is convenient when you're craving the delicious food from this place but you're slumped at home. I love this place!",

My mom, who is an extremely picky eater, loves coming here every single time she visits me in Vegas.

I live in Fort Worth and we do not have any pho restaurants that make the broth this flavorful besides homemade pho.

It could have used a bit more vegetables and noodles in the bowl but overall it was very good. Add in some hot sauce to make it a hit as it's pretty mild on its own.   I also had the spring rolls which were a nice side dish. The peanut sauce was fresh and the rolls were good although they lacked in the protein. One roll was evenly packed with the meat while the other was just veggie. Still tasty but they need to evenly space the innards.   In total the meal cost about $15. That's a steal and I had leftovers for a full meal the next day. Great prices and open late. If you're in Chinatown looking for some fresh Vietnamese give this place a go.",

But this one time I came in with my family of 10 and we sat in the back and we ordered waters. As the QUEEN was proceeding to dispense our waters, my mom asked if my dad could get an unsweet tea to which he replied VERY RUDELY with a heavy accent \"WAT UNSWEET TEE\"? and rolled his eyes at us looking VERY angry. And I replied \"My dad wants an unsweet tea\" which he responded again very rudely \"WAT UNSWEET TEE? It wasn't like we were asking for anything complicated like VSOP Hennessy on the rocks. My family immediately became VERY uncomfortable and it wasn't a reason to leave but please management, train this QUEEN (blonde tips) to know what unsweet tea is and to be more kind and compassionate. Maybe he was rude bc we were also Vietnamese, who knows. This won't stop me from coming but I definitely will either ask for a different server or leave altogether and come back when he ain't there.",

There's nothing quite like a bowl of pho when you're feeling a little down, and the large bowl at Viet Noodle Bar is more than enough to satisfy most appetites.   Oxtail pho doesn't have a \"size,\" but it's got a LOT of meat - 3 pieces of oxtail - that it easily outweighs the large. I didn't know that, though, and I had already ordered a side of spring rolls. No regrets on taste, but maybe a little regret on ordering too much food.  Right after I gave the server my order, he commented, \"nice choice!\" on the oxtail pho. Why, thank you! I try to eat the best items at restaurants, and the oxtail pho is up there in the top pho I've had.",

There are plenty of pho places in Vegas and I am glad I tried out Viet Noodle Bar. It's pretty good, a little more flavorful on broth and they aren't stingy with the portion either. Pretty good pho for the value.  Service was very quick and did their job. Waters were quickly refilled except for near the end. There is a TV that was playing the game when I went there.",

    "text": "This place is pretty decent. The restaurant is nice and clean, lots of small 4-tops against the wall and bigger tables for larger parties in the middle. We were greeted and seated immediately, water was served immediately and the server was ready to take our order.   My dad wanted to try the broken rice (com tam) but they serve the dish with normal rice instead of the broken rice... which is really strange! Com tam is not com tam without com tam :) - I am not picky but I just cannot eat Com Tam with regular rice, it is just not the same.   My dad and brother both got Com Bo Luc Lac with fried rice (you can choose from: white rice, red rice (white rice and tomato sauce), or fried rice. They really liked it! Said the rice smelled and tasted really good, the beef is also nicely marinated and tasted good. We have been eating Com Bo Luc Lac at Pho Saigon 8 for years, we really like theirs but they put too much sauce on their beef which wets the rice and can be too salty. This place has a nice amount of sauce and even more beef too! Probably a new place we will go to for CBLL!  I got the Pho Ap Chao Combination! I really like the pho, it is very crispy, they cut it into pieces so it is very easy to eat. The combination has: beef, shredded chicken, shrimp, squid, broccoli, onions, celery, carrots and a few other veggies. I really like that they have lots of broccoli and shredded chicken! However, I find the gravy/sauce to be a little too sweet for my taste, too much sugar in the sauce, I would have liked it more if it was more savory than sweet. However, this place has much better Pho Ap Chao than other places so I will most likely come again.",

The Pho broth is one of the best I've had even compared to pho places in Chinatown in LA, which says a lot!  They have a lot of speciality pho here (rib eye and oxtail). The rib eye is good, but I always go with the classic rare pho tai.   MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR PHO OIL. They bring out a special blend of pho oil with green onion. If you put a spoonful or two in your pho, it boosts the umami flavor of the pho an extra notch. This is one of the main reasons I love this place.   Also, their Vietnamese crepe is DELICIOUS. The portion for the crepe is huge. My husband and I share this, but we've also shared it with a group of 4 and it's sufficient.",

The waiter brought the BBQ to the table, and there was so much oil in the reservoir on the top, and the waiter left the heat so high, that the oil popped up and hit my daughter (4 years old) in the face, even though she was sitting a few seats away from the grill. Now, I've eaten BBQ of this type many times, and I have never seen anything like this happen. After she was burned, she cried out and screamed for several minutes after this happened. Not once did a staff member come by to see if everything was okay, even after mentioning it to the waiter.   Further, we placed an order for one type of BBQ (beef/shrimp), and received (and were charged) with the beef, shrimp and squid due to an apparent language barrier between us and our waiter.   The food was just okay, and but I wasn't blown away with the service, quality, or price. It's definitely NOT kid friendly, and I would think twice about bringing my kid here again.",

It's very different from American beef stew, but I liked trying a different spin (with either fresh basil or cilantro) in the stew. I started with spring rolls, which are not fried and wrapped with rice paper. I liked it although the filling of shrimp and pork was a bit dry. I also got a side of grilled pork (you can get different types of grilled meats as a side dish). They were delicious and seasoned and grilled to perfection. I didn't try pho, though, it seems to be popular these days, just like ramen, but I'm not interested. I think I tried pho somewhere once and remember the broth being bland, unlike ramen. I also didn't care for the types of noodles. I'm just happy with the other types of Vietnamese food, though.",

If you're craving pho late night, they close at 2am which is wonderful. Other pho spots that are 24 hours or late night doesn't compare to the quality of food here.

    "text": "We came here for dinner earlier this evening and it was actually our second visit, overall. Last time we were here, we came around 11pm and stumbled here since Pho Kim Long was waaay too packed. Thanks Yelpers! Anywho, we loved it so much, that we decided to come back. I had been telling my sis about how yummy my hubby's rib eye pho and my oxtail pho were. This evening, my sis and I both ordered small bowls of tendon pho and added sides of ribeye. The small portion was perfect for me. My sis ended up taking some of hers to go. My husband got an order of ribeye pho and I want to say that was a large bowl? I'm not too sure, but the bowl was larger than the tendon ones. Broth is key to success with pho. Crappy broth= crappy pho. The flavor of the broth was on point, yet again. No need to pour heaping amounts of Hoisin sauce to make up for lack of flavor. The tendon was tender (say that 10 times over) and ribeye was yuuuum! My next visit, though, I'm gonna ask them to toss the ribeye slices in and not as a side. It was slightly a little more rare than I thought, even after it sat in the broth for a while. My hubby loved his, of course. We also ordered charbroiled pork spring rolls which came with a side of dipping sauce that was fish sauce based. It was a twist on the usual pork and shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce. I think we might pass on that next time, though. Nothing too special about it. Great service, even with how busy they were. PS, get the Thai tea!",

You just dip the wrapper into the water they provide and roll up the meat, lettuce, mint, and rice noodle. Dip it in the sauce and there you go...a little piece of heaven.

At least the floors were clean.  I startes with an order of Spring rolls with shrimp and pork, they were great, the fish sauce was a little on the strong side, could have uses some fresh lime and more water.  Next I ordered a large Pho rib eye noodle soup, good size bowl, chop sticks were individualy wrapes wooden disposable, they put a lot of rib eye in the soup, more than other places when you order extra meat.  The soup's broth seemed a little watered down, the server refilled my water as soon as it was low.   Service was good Food Quality was good a few minor changes would make it great.

    "text": "This establishment understands authentic Vietnamese dining while not sacrificing american dining traditions. Most Asian eateries will do it Asia style, I.e. puts down menus, but takes orders before you can even open the menu (let's be honest, Asian people know what they want when they eat out. No need for a menu) drops off food, never returns again...unless you raise your hand to let them know you need something. I understand this, and while also being an American born Asian, I've accepted the cultural difference! Not here. They're really good and also very sweet and prompt about checking back with you to make sure you're enjoying your food. I had to ask for a million different things last night and even I was annoyed with myself. Everyone there was more than happy to get me whatever I needed. Never once made me feel like I was asking for too much!!  As you can read, I'm already ecstatic! More importantly, dang the food was bomb!! I came for pho many times before. I finally decided to tap into my past and retry other Vietnamese cuisine that I have otherwise forgotten about. I tried, for the first time as an adult, Bo/tom nuong vi. My belly was giving me the hour long middle finger for not trying this sooner. For those of you reading this, it's a grill in front of you, self cooking of meat and shrimp, and then rolling yourself up some spring rolls! It's an experience and it's tasty! A lot of multitasking involved so bring someone who can do more than 1 thing at a time. I made this mistake and forcefully ended up with most of the responsibility. HAHA! We also tried the bun bo hue, a spicy noodle dish that I remember disliking as a child. I haven't had it in 19 years. They tossed meat in there like it was about to go out of style! Sooo much meat. I ain't mad about it! Twas tasty. I will say though, My heart still belongs to pho. That's the only Vietnamese noodle soup in my heart. Would I come back here?! Abso-PHO-king-lutely.",

    "text": "Second time here and normally the service is very hospitable and quick with requests; today not so much. We asked for a different waiter and the new guy was more attentive to our needs (party of 6). We ordered plenty of food and the original waiter complained saying you should have asked for a bigger table if you wanted to order a lot of food...what?? Of course we want a lot of food, there is 6 of us eat and share. Service began as a 2-3 but ended with a 3-4.   We were seated within about 5 minutes though it was a very busy during Sunday lunch. After dealing with the aforementioned waiter (oh and not receiving two dishes we ordered), the new guy brought everything we asked for. We ordered waters and a couple Viet-coffee's, these were tasty iced coffees that the family shared.  We started with some spring rolls which came served with fish sauce and a second type of sauce, darker and had a distinct smell. The spring rolls were fresh and delicious 5/5. Next we ordered a couple marinated beef platters with shrimp. They brought out the grills and we cooked to our liking. The meat had good flavor and didn't have any fat, the shrimp was also marinated and was fresh 5/5. They brought out the veggie platter / fixings for our hand rolls and two trays of crisp wraps with warm water. It was interesting building your own wrap, including bean sprouts, noodles, lettuce, herbs and sauce. We also ordered some woven noodle which I wrapped around the fresh cooked meat and dipped in the fish sauce 5/5. Lastly we ordered a couple small ramen beef bowls (after the rolls was big enough to share) typical broth flavoring but the beef was good 4/5. Spiced it up a little with some Sriracha and hoi sen sauce.   Overall the meal was very good and the family had a good time. Only reason they received 4/5 is because of the original service. Will be back again, and now we know who not to ask for. Enjoy the pics",

    "text": "\"I just want to begin by saying to Roosevelt E. Roosevelt, what it is, what it shall be, what it was...\" - Adrian Cronauer  Viet Noodle Bar is an all-around good choice for Vietnamese food in Vegas, but there are dishes here that I absolutely love!   The Banh Xeo (Vietnamese Crepe) was the first dish to catch my attention at VNB. The dish isn't overly complicated, but super tasty. The crepe is cooked with onions, shrimp, and pork and folded over in half. There is a jungle of veg accompanying the crepe that includes a stuffing of bean sprouts, a side of pickled carrot & radish, some lettuce leafs, Tia To (Perilla), La Qu (Thai Basil), and fresh sliced cucumber. You decide how much herbs and veggies to wrap-up with some of the crepe in a leaf of lettuce, then dip it into the sweet fish sauce and enjoy.  I've enjoyed all the Phos and soups that I've had at VNB, but I return to the Chicken Pho more than others. I like to limit the amount of red meat I eat so I'm not usually opting for traditional Pho, but it is excellent here as well, as is the Ox Tail Pho. Chicken is typically more hit and miss at Vietnamese spots though--often an afterthought lacking flavor or loaded with msg. While certainly not eliminating the msg, VNB does a great job of not relying on it for the main source of flavoring and are still able to develop a substantially flavorful broth in their Chicken Pho.  One of my least favorite things about Viet Noodle Bar is the popularity of the on-table BBQ grills. It seems to be a good value for the amount of meat you are supplied with...probably why they are popular...but the result is a restaurant that often reeks of grilled meat. This is not always the smell you want to be wearing for the remainder of your day...so dine with caution. I haven't even ordered any of the grilled entrees, but swear that at least half the time I've carried this smell with me until freed by a shower.   I shared an order of the Bo luc lc (Shaken Beef) with a large group one time and found it be quite good...but again, not something that I partake in all that often.",

Only complaint was our food took quite some time to come out. There was about 10 of us and 2 of us got food at a time. If you weren't the one to wait, everyone ate a different times. Restaurants tend to time their food so that everyone got it together.   Pho Ap Chao - This was what I got and it was pretty good. There was a lot of veggies and meat on top of the noodles. Noodles were incredibly crispy which I liked.   Banh Xeo - My husband got this and it was not bad. The flavor of the batter was solid. It was a bit soggy though and we prefer if these were crisp and fresh off the pan.   I would say this is a decent Vietnamese restaurant but nothing ever beats a home cooked Vietnamese meal from mom's. If we were in the area and nothing else was open, we could come back. Otherwise, not the first place we would seek out.",

Pho was good, even though they mixed up the order. The chicken wings had too much sauce on them. We also ordered shrimp fried rice and it was unimpressive. My second time attempting to give this place another try (because it had come highly recommended) was absolutely HORRIBLE! Just a party of two, when we arrived there were people already in the waiting area, obviously busier on a Sunday. I put my name down behind three other parties. The host comes and immediately seats a party that arrived AFTER us and the three other parties ahead of us WITHOUT even looking at the check-in sheet. Everyone waiting looked at each other and one couple just rolled their eyes and walked out. When the host returns and crosses out two names ahead of me, that were obviously still standing waiting. I try to explain that other people were here before the ones he just sat and he completely ignores me! Does not even look at me and just turns his back and says \"yea, yea, yea!\" We walked out obviously. Absolutely disgusting service. I would never go back, I don't care if they were giving food away for free.",

It reminds me of being back in the Bay Area and the food is delicious! So far, I've been here twice and I ordered Hu Tieu (Dry with seafood) and Pho. Omg, the Hu Tieu was amazing! Probably the best one I've tried so far in Vegas. The seafood one comes with soup on the side and I believe it's fish chunks in the broth. My hubby ordered a large with BBQ pork and the broth was just simply satisfying. They loaded their bowls with lots of meat! Very.. veeeerrry generous! Usually, some places give you 1-2 shrimps but I got like 4-5 pieces. The pho was perfect! I seriously didn't need to add any hoisin sauce or lime. It was just so good by itself. Instead of drenching my soup with Sriracha and all the other seasonings is they have on the table, I just dipped my meats with it in every bite. The workers are so nice too. They come by and check up on you. Love it! The shrimp egg rolls are great too by the way. I am definitely going here more often. So many good things on the menu to still try! This place is known for their oxtail pho. So everyone who lives here or visiting, that's what the #1 recommendation is. I'll update my post when I try something new! Cheers & happy eating!",

After they brought out our food, they never came back to check up on us. The pho was delicious, btw, which is why I came back with my husband and kids just this past weekend.   I was craving for pho & my husband wanted bun bo hue. The place was packed when we arrived, & it took them about ten minutes to seat us. Our daughter ordered the rice plate with chicken, I ordered the pho dac biet (combination pho), & hubsters ordered bun bo hue. We also ordered an order of the spring rolls which was delicious! The pho took about 10 minutes to get to our table, my daughter's food took about 15-20 minutes, & my husband's food took about 30-40 minutes to finally come out. He was pissed... But that didn't stop him from enjoying his bun bo hue. Everything was delicious which is why I decided to give this place 3/5 stars. Their service still sucked, & I was hoping that it wasn't a repeat of my first visit; however, they did end up refilling our waters more than once so I guess there's that.   Would I be coming back? Ummm... Probably, most likely. But it wouldn't be my first choice to cure my pho fix.",

The truth is I personally didn't order it, I tried the pho that my friend had and I honestly wanted to steal his whole bowl it was that good( He might have stopped me by giving the evil eye, but that's okay. I can't blame him. ) You know when you have pho and you know there are spices in it, but your not exactly sure what they are, because they just didn't put enough in? Well forget about that at this place. You will taste the spices,you'll probably wonder how much they put in and why other places don't do the same, but believe me when I say this: The pho is amazing.",

I recommend literally everyone that comes into my job asking for a good Vietnamese place to eat at and i convinced all my non-asian friends to come here as well.. let's just say that this place is the best you're going to find if you want authentic delicious Vietnamese cuisine! I'm a REALLY REALLY picky person when it comes to my culture food and this place hasn't let me down..   ***BUT the only complaint i have is that they changed their bowl sizes recently which completely SUCKS because all your broth overflows the bowl and makes a huge mess!! I can't even mix it comfortably without everything falling out which is super annoying!***  I'm not going to list everything i've tried because i'll be here for an hour typing but let's just start off with some of my favorites... Pho ap chao, Combination pho, all their broken rice dishes, and Banh Xeo! They pretty much have a big ranged menu that will probably satisfy any of your cravings..    This place gradually got more popular and busier but the service is still amazing, very attentive and caring workers who makes it feel like home! I love the environment here! Huge portion sizes and flavorful food.. ever since i moved out i hadn't been able to eat a lot of my mom vietnamese cooking so this place is where i go to get my fixings! :)",

I try to always get a different food item whenever I come back. I highly recommend the pho tai bo vien (rare steak and meatballs), bun rieu, or their BBQ specialty platter (Bo Nuong Vi). It feeds around 3-4 people and it's such an amazing social experience. Many of my friends do not know how to roll their own spring rolls whenever we get the BBQ so I spend a lot of my time rolling their springs rolls instead of eating...but man, the meat and all the veggies with it is superb.

The menu sounds great with a lot of traditional Vietnamese dishes but I was so disappointed in the meats that I regretted recommending this place to my friends (not the best impression).   We had the nem nuong (marinated pork sausage), bo la lot (beef wrapped in leaves) and banh xeo (crispy Vietnamese crepe). The Banh Xeo was good. It was crispy and had all the traditional ingredients, including mung bean that some places to don't always provide. We should've gotten two of these and concluded our dinner. Then came the meat. We were told that it takes them awhile to cook the meat. With that disclosure, I was excited. As it came out, it was cold and so dry that it crumbled to the cut. The lack of moisture disguised the flavor. The flavor was not as sweet or salty. In fact, it reminded me of cooking lean ground beef from the package and mistakenly left it too long. Tried to mask as much as we could with the fish sauce and pineapple shrimp sauce (no pineapple chunks, I guess they just utilize the juice?)  Genuinely wish this place would live up to the impression that the menu and Vegas gives. I suggest to skip this one and look at other options.",

The bowl may look small but the dept of the bowl can hold more then what I can eat. Portions were larger then your eyes.",

I ordered shrimp pho and calamari. The calamari were just the rings, but were tasty, although my preference are the ones that have tentacles mixed in too. But, I digress. The pho came out and it was piping hot. I knew it would be good because the broth was free of any oily film, which happens a lot with pho. The soup was AMAZING. Shrimp cooked perfectly, brother flavorful and light, noodles and all other parts of the soup delicious! I will definitely be back!",

So if you don't like left overs, don't waste food and order the smaller portion, which I'm sure you'll sip every last drop of. I particularly always do rare steak any time I do Pho, just not a fan of the other type of meat just in general.   Highly recommend the spring rolls & thai iced tea.",

We immediately call for a server, tell him about it and he takes it away immediately and says we'll replace it. We say no can we have the plate back so that would could get clearer photos and evidence of what it was. He said okay but never returns. We then ask for a manager and nothing. We then ask another server for the manager and he brings him  THIS IS WHEN WE GOT MAD   the manager then proceeds to rip apart the spring roll and say \"this is pork it has bones\" i then say ive had food and pork  with bones before. That is not a bone. He then asks me \"YOU KNOW WHAT A TOOTH TASTE LIKE??\" I say \"no but i know one when i see one he says \"I DONT KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU MY TEETH ARE RIGHT HERE\" the unprofessionalism of this manager is out of this world. No we did not want a replacement. We will never eat here again. But the way they handled it like it had happened before.   I dont know what kind of tooth that was. Maybe a baby pigs or idk but it was def a tooth.   DO NOT eat here again.",

Sadly when the bowl arrived it looked like it was a bowl from the night before. My bowl of bun bo hue was scrapped from the bottom of last nights pot, it had no meat in it only tendon, blood, and Cha. The noodles were all broken and the broth had absolutely no spice, it was actually sweet which is not what I am used to, for me bun bo hue is supposed to be spicy. I have eaten here before but ordered pho the first time which was not bad but today when I got the bun bo hue it was such a disappointment that it makes me never want to come back to this restaurant.",

We were seated as soon as someone was available to attend to us.  The menu is pretty big and offers a lot of different choices.  I really wanted to have the banh hoi as that's what I was looking for, and yelped this restaurant, and looked up reviews and saw that they served it!  You only get to pick one type of meat (i'm used to being able to select 3 meats), but that was fine.   The platter came and it was huge!  3-4 pieces of lettuce, 10-12 pieces of woven vermicelli, a pile of cucumbers and pickled radish/carrots, a pile of mint, and stack of about 15-16 pieces of rice paper and hot water to create our masterpiece.  Their fish sauce is SOOOOOOO good!! dipping the vermicelli in the fish sauce, then topping with some veggies and meat.  A squeeze of hoisin sauce, mint and lime juice.  Made for some good bites!!  Salivating just thinking about it! Definitely was good to feed 2 with the amount of food that was given.  My family also got the tomato paste crab noodle soup. I had some of the soup base, and it was so yummy!! full of crab flavour, and the crab meatballs were huge and plentiful.  Definitely will come here again when I come to vegas!  If you want good Vietnamese food, come here!  The service was also superb.  They were quick to come out with food, and get utensils or whatever was asked of them.",

    "text": "If you ever develop a late-night pho craving, Viet Noodle Bar is the place to go. Monday thru Sunday, their hours are 9 AM - 6 AM. And their location on Spring Mountain makes for a very convenient spot as it's not too far away from the strip.   Restaurant is pretty big. There are a lot of booths around the restaurant while the middle section is filled with tables. Since tables can be pulled together for larger parties, Viet Noodle Bar can accommodate huge crowds if needed.   My friend and I stopped by for dinner and were quickly seated and given menus. Besides pho, they also serve specialty dishes, vegetarian dishes, rice, porridge, vermicelli, etc. We stuck with the pho and we both ordered a small \"make your own\" pho bowl combination. There are six different meat choices and you can order just one or all of them if you prefer. I ended up choosing rare steak, flank and tendon. At $8.75 for the small ($9.75 for large), the portion size was pretty good. Right when the bowls were served, I noticed that there was a huge amount of meat - I couldn't see the pho noodles at all. Once I began eating, I felt like the noodles didn't end! I had a hard time finishing that small bowl - and all the meat inside! They also provided the standard mint leaves, beansprouts, and lime. Meat was pretty tender. Nothing too special about it; noodles were also very good. I would say the broth tasted quite good. It wasn't too salty nor did it lack flavor. I also liked the fact that they had a good amount of cilantro inside that bowl.   tl;dr - Viet Noodle Bar serves up dishes that hit the spot. While I only ordered pho, I felt like the other dishes that customers ordered looked quite tasty. I enjoyed my bowl of pho. Price point was pretty good, and since the restaurant is almost always open, the workers don't hassle you to leave once you're finished eating.",

The inside looks very modern with all the new looking furniture. And the booth cushions weren't too firm. The service was great, the waiter even helped us make up our minds and had some good recommendations.  On to the food, I got the rare steak pho and I was hungry but I didn't think a large bowl would be the best option because my dinner plans weren't letting me go crazy for lunch. Once the pho got there I made it my own and I digged in! The broth was very tasteful and the noodles were really good. Once I got half way I realized that I was getting full already. So that let me know that it was still a good serving size for what you are paying for. I was very satisfied at the end of my meal so I will definitely return and recommend this place!",

After about ten minutes we got to order. The soup was okay. It taste a lot like the instant pho broth. Didnt really taste like they had the bone broth simmering for hours before serving. When i asked for napkins, the waiter looked irritated, but i only asked because my dad's beer started foaming up and spilled everywhere. Gratuity was already included for a part of six.

    "text": "Ive frequented this place many times and enjoy my experiences there. The food is amazing viet food ...fresh and the service has been alright too!  The location is in china town.. its a huge restaurant so theres many seatings.. theres not much of a long wait at all.. so getting seated quick is awesome.   So the ambiance here.. since theres table side cooking here theres is a nice smell of food as soon as you walk in. I ordered the table side cooking a few times and the meats and seafood is fresh and quite yummy. You can cook the meats and make your own spring roll here. The only thing I wish they carried is the Ca Nuong here... the baked catfish! they do not have it.. I love rolling my spring roll with fish. Maybe one day they will carry it. Anyways the last time I was here I believe I ordered a rice dish with korean spare ribs with a fried egg on the side.. very yum!! I also ordered the fish porridge too.. quite tasty! for dessert I always order the FLAN !!! omg its the best flan ever! it has a nice coffee taste to it. I order it every time if they don't sell out. I normally don't order much of the drinks cause for some reason its overly sweet most of the time! just order water... lol   Overall i love this place. its open late! food is delicious! service isn't bad. Atmosphere is cool.. you can have a booth so its pretty private too when you sit at a booth.",

We didn't catch his name, but he was the only server with glasses, he was short, he had a bit of limp, medium length black hair. He only interacted with us once to take our order, got our order wrong, then when we went to pay, we took a little time to calculate the tip (we always tip bc we work in food and understand the struggle). He did NOT deserve the tip, he rolled his eyes at us not thinking we wouldn't see because we were taking a while to do the math and sign the check. I would not return again or recommend this place to others. Hope you all fix your service and maybe we'll give it another chance.",

Location-  The plaza is fairly on the smaller size, but when I went there, there was plenty of parking.   Food/Price-  The food was surprisingly good for the price that we paid. It was flavorful and it was filling enough to make everyone full. The portion sizes parallels with the price, making this experience more enjoyable.   Service-  The only reason why I didn't give this place a five star was because of this. There were many instances where other tables were seated, but they had to wait awhile to be given a menu. More so, it took a while( appx 10 min.) for them to take our orders and to give us the bill.   In general, I definitely will be back if my trip was not time sensitive.",

Broth is delicious and the combination has lots of meat to fill you up. Fish is added to the seafood pho and not imitation crab. Service is usually great here. The dudes are usually attentive. If not just raise your hand like how Asian fobs do it and get service right away. Find me here often past 3am. Usually alone and very well focused on my bowl. Price is the same at most pho places. Lots of parking during late hours but when it's busy good luck bleh or just at the next plaza and walk over. Huge plus with their TVs always paying Sportscenter and some nights the music is not bad either. All in all I love coming here!",

The staff is very friendly and the food is delicious. Must try their Udon and Wonton Noodle soups very flavorful. You can also customize dishes to what you want. Overall another better option than Pho Kim Long and Jenny Pho around the Spring Mountain Rd. corridor foodie scene.  Another cool option if your dinning with a group, is their BBQ combo meal, good for approximately 2-4ppl. It comes with a selection of meats, shrimp & squid. Assortment of vegetables (lettuce,cucumbers,carrots,daikon,bean sprouts & mint), Rice Noodles, Rice Paper and various dipping sauces. The rice paper allows you to customize your own spring rolls. A cool alternative from your Korean BBQ table top cooking.",

Around 10 min later, no one come and take order, no one approach and serving water,.... I call a server that we're ready to order...she response will be right back and just walked away doing her own staff... few minutes later, there's a male server realized we need to order and took our order... still no water... we kinda waiting water for 20 min... my party was angry and call a server for water... The server responded \"ok, sorry! I'm not the one who took your order...\" and walked away...   Really, food is good, service is horrible, I suppose leave 1star for the server's attitude... but the boy whom took our order deserve partial positive feedback...

I just got back from Vietnam where pho broth is incredibly light and refreshing so Im happy to find something similar at home.    I first came here a long time ago for the ox tail pho. I really enjoyed it,  they give a lot of ox tail and the portion is probably enough for two.   I've also ordered the bun bo hue here,  it honestly wasn't my favorite.  The broth was strangely sweet and didn't taste authentic.  This was a long time ago so maybe it's changed since then?  Yesterday I got a small pho with rare steak,  tendon and the beef balls for an extra $1.50. Omg the best part was the beef balls!  They're big with pieces of tendon and really flavorful.  I tried the beef balls at pho Kim long the other day and they were disgusting and flavorless compared to the ones here.  :) also try the fatty flank!  It adds a really good flavor.  The small portion was just enough.    I like how there's lots of seating here,  you'll rarely have to wait long to be seated.   I'll definitely be back often.",

I called and they immediately found the extra order in their system, apologized and said that I could either take it as a credit for my next visit or come in immediately to get a cash refund as they weren't able to refund my credit card for one specific item. I told them that I was about to leave Vegas and couldn't do either, so they offered to take down my address and mail me a check. Sure enough, the check arrived just a few days after I got home and I live all the way on the East Coast. Although I wish they mix up didn't happen in the first place, they were great about fixing it.",

Their Chicken Pho is loaded with bite sized pieces of shredded meat that keeps it moist.  Noodles in Pho is usually a personal preference and these are full length (which I enjoy) and can be messy.  For those who like the exotic, they have Oxtail Pho on the menu.  It is an acquired taste, with a prime rib type of flavor and they use the larger, fatty pieces.  Surprisingly, the people I was with REALLY liked the dish , after they got over the origin location of the meat.  I prefer the leaner smaller pieces, but those are far and few in the dish.  This place really a nice place to come in after a long day an a cool desert evening.  The staff is very helpful with the menu, for us who are not that familiar with Vietnamese food.  The establishment is modern in decor and they interestingly have advertisements from other businesses inside their menu.",

    "text": "I stopped by Viet Noodle Bar on a Thursday evening with my roommate and the place was pretty busy. The restaurant is large so there was still plenty of seating available. The menu is really diverse, they have all the main Viet dishes you may be looking for - Pho, Bun Bo Hue, Bun Rieu, Com Tam, Banh Xeo, etc.   I asked the waiter what the specialty dishes of the restaurant are- he mentioned Bun Bo Hue, Banh Xeo, and Pho Ap Chao. It was really windy and cold out so I opted for Bun Bo Hue. The broth was pretty good, noodles standard, it was served with huyet (pig blood), some kind of pork cha, beef shank, and oxtail. They don't serve BBH with the pork knuckle/pork leg here (which is fine with me because I usually opt out of it anyway).   Overall the BBH was okay, decent broth but I felt like it was missing the complexity of other BBH's I've had. I have high standards for BBH since half of my fam is from Hue and my auntie makes some bombbb homemade BBH. I'll have to come back to try their Pho which is what everyone seems to rave about on Yelp.",

I ordered a Combo Pho and a Vietnamese Coffee, and my friend ordered the Beef Pho. I was initially worried that a regular wouldn't be enough for me, but I was actually blown away by the generosity of the portion sizes. The previous reviews weren't kidding when they mentioned that they were generous with their toppings and meats. The flavor of the broth was also on point. I would rate the Pho 6/5 stars. The Vietnamese coffee, on the other hand, was a little lacking. It was very sweet and I couldn't really taste the coffee, so next time I think I would try out one of their Thai Teas instead.   Overall, I had a great experience! I'll definitely be back.",

The place is a more modern twist to what I'm use to but the hubby says it reminds him of home which is Cali.   Portions are decent. We started off with some spring rolls and summer rolls. Both were good but my summer rolls were the grilled pork kind. I wish they were hot and not cold. Spring rolls or egg rolls came with sides of veggies so you can do wraps. Pretty cool because I've never seen it served that way.   I had the classic bowl of beef rice noodle soup called PHO. That tells me if the restaurant is really good. If they mess up that, no point in trying anything else. The broth was on the slight greasy side than I like it but it was very good. The meats weren't old and the ingredients were all fresh.   Service was great. My drinks were never empty and food came out fast as it should. You can tell it's good when the locals come to eat. Look forward to coming here again when I visit.",

Try the bun bo hue, the broth is nice and flavorful, satay flavor mixed with scents of lemongrass.  Many places in town are too delicate with this broth of bun bo hue.  It is a test to legitimate a noodle place.  There are restaurants in southern california that only serves this noodle as its main dish.  The pho is consistently good, hot and soothing.  Don't underestimate the temperature of the pho.  Many places in town serves lukewarm broth and by the time you add in basil, culantro and bean sprouts, you might as well be eating gazpacho.  The grilled dishes are really good, same price points as many other places in town.  However, for the side dishes you get with the main, you will need help from 1-2 other friends to finish them all.  Here is where Viet Noodle Bar excels with its service, they don't charge extra to replenish the veggies, noodles or rice paper.",

This place was recommended to me by 2 of my coworkers so having driven by with my 2 sisters and cousin I had to stop in and see what this place was about. We decided before coming in that we would just get fresh spring rolls to-go, but the atmosphere captured us so we decided to stay. To my surprise the interior is very modern, they have a couple TVs and play music pop/hip hop music. None of which take away from the chill zen-ish vibe. Our waiter was great but he was also the only one to interact with us the whole time. Understandable since there didn't seem to be too much staff at this time. To my surprise tho he didn't mind at all that we decided on eating there instead of taking togo. All we had were the spring rolls which we decided on before coming in with the plan on taking togo. I really enjoyed them. Some people say fresh spring rolls are fresh spring rolls, but If you eat a lot of Vietnamese food you know that isn't True. Here they have a larger lettuce over noodle ratio and I sort of forgot my spring rolls had pork because It was sliced so thinly, but flavor was all there. Especially with the sauce ! Which I AM a big critic of. I like to drench my spring rolls in the sauce so I really appreciated the subtle flavor and perfect consistency. I'm giving 4 stars today because theres basically a whole menu I still need to try, but I couldn't have asked for a better 1st visit!",

I stole some of my moms pho and Wowwwww this pho (with beef) was deeeelicious!! Not too greasy, beef was tender, broth was amazing. Service is pretty good. I like that they're not so overwhelming. They were very prompt with any extra things we needed. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas and I now know to order the pho!!",

I did catch some wings going to another table so I'll definitely try does out next time.",

Service was quick and that is always a plus for me. i shall be back!",

I did not have any Pho here, but I had the charbroiled beef lettuce and rice noodle/paper wraps and added a side of nem nuong (pork meatballs). This dish was very good, the beef was marinated perfectly with garlic and scallions, the pork meatballs were perfectly seasoned. I could not get over how great they served the rice paper with the hot water so that you are able to make your own rolls. Usually the rice paper cracks or is not pliable enough, but they were able to serve it in a little holder with hot water to dip it in, and the paper turned out perfectly! I will come back again.",

The restaurant is a little hidden inside of a strip mall but is rather spacious inside and rather clean/modern inside compared to many other Vietnamese restaurants in town. The bathrooms were also well kept. We walked in and chose a booth by the window.   The only real complaint was that service was a little slow. While both the manager/owner and server were very friendly, it took quite a while to get our check and place our order once we were seated. The restaurant was pretty empty, so that isn't really acceptable to me, but the food and demeanor of the staff definitely made up for it.   We ordered the spring rolls and egg rolls, both of which were pretty solid (though in my opinion it is rather hard to mess up either of these things). The pho was VERY good. I think this place puts more meat in the bowl than any other restaurant in Vegas, so that's always a perk, and the broth pretty incredible.   I can't speak to any of the other items on the menu as we stuck with the pho, but we'd definitely come back and give the other dishes a try in the future.",

Their menu is extensive where you can choose a variety of options. I ordered the pho with the meat on the side. They give you a decent amount of meat in proportion to the noodle. I thought the small bowl of pho was large enough but if you are really hungry, I recommend upgrading to the large.   Prices are standard for pho. Come check out this place if you're in the area!",

It's a spicy beef noodle soup with just the right amount of sweet, salty, sour, and spicy to tickle your taste buds. Not feeling beefy? Get the bun rieu, a tomato broth soup that's topped with pillowy chunks of minced crab paste. So satisfying!   My favorite is the table top BBQ (bo nuong vi). You basically cook your meat on a grill, then wrap it in rice paper with noodles and veggies. It's filling yet refreshing at the same time. I get that it can be kind of intimidating if you're ordering it for the first time, but don't be shy and just ask for assistance. I'm sure the staff would be happy to teach you how to enjoy this dish. The Vietnamese crepe is also good but a bit skimpy on the filling. I'd request extra meat.   Overall, the food is pretty solid. The restaurant is clean, welcoming, and doesn't scare away my non-Asian friends. I'll be back.",

If I really wanted to be picky only minor complaint would be broth not steamy enough.   it when broth is freakin steamy hot while I dump the bean sprouts in    Also had the Thai tea and that was a bit too sweet but no biggie.

I had my food delivered through Postmates and I'm so impressed how it was still hot despite some traffic my Postmates driver went through.   The oxtail meat was perfection. So tender and fatty (honestly, my favorite part), it definitely hit the spot and my sore throat is nearly gone! I had my soup spicier than usual by putting in the sriracha sauce that's provided with the mint leaves and lime.",

    "text": "Las Vegas is certainly not the first city that comes to mind when you think of Vietnamese food. However, new restaurants like this one might start to change that mindset.  Well, relatively new anyway. Viet Noodle Bar has been open for several months now, but I've neglected to visit it until now despite hearing warm reviews. When my mom inexplicably expressed interest in Vietnamese food after flying in from San Jose (a True Viet food mecca), this place was at the top of my list. Thus, I navigated down Spring Mountain Road and into this narrow plaza between Decatur and Lindell.  We were seated promptly after we waved hello at an employee. It looks clean and inviting, down to the easy-to-read menus with both Vietnamese and English food names. The television sets were all on ESPN, which was broadcasting a game involving the NBA-leading Warriors. Service and food prep time were reasonable.  #44 Com Bo Luc Lac ($12.95): stir-fried filet mignon (more commonly known as \"shaking beef\") with rice. They dared to serve this without any sauce included, which meant a lot. The beef was tender and well-seasoned, and they were sufficiently complemented by delicious grilled onions, pickled carrot and daikon, and fresh lettuce and cucumber. The rice wasn't especially flavorful, but it did the job.  #59 Banh Xeo ($10.95): simply referred to as \"Vietnamese Crepe,\" this is a savory, entree-sized dish of crispy rice flour and turmeric folded and filled with bean sprouts, small shrimp, and pork. Pickled carrot and daikon, cucumber feature here too, as well as two fragrant herbs. It's intended to be eaten wrapped in lettuce, but I ended up lazily eating the lettuce on the side later on. The array of veggies represents Vietnamese cuisine well, but the \"crepe\" batter, as it were, is a little bit on the sweet side, and the protein portion is a little lacking.  #24 Mi Hai VI Kho ($9.95): egg noodle with seafood, served \"dry.\" I didn't taste much of this, but I got to try the broth on the side with fish. Lovely seasoned broth, moist and flaky fish. My mom did enjoy it overall.  I'll probably come back to Viet Noodle Bar soon to try other dishes. With a wide array of traditional Vietnamese dishes to sample on the menu - not just noodles, but pho, rice dishes, grilled meats, and even dessert - this restaurant has a lot of promise.",

The server kept the refills coming without interrupting our conversation. My vermicelli bowl was good, nothing mind-blowing but the meat was well-cooked, moist and flavorful.

Hence, we made ugly, sloppy rolls. The staff were so nice to help us out after figuring out we had problems. Lol. We also ordered their house special pho which was piping hot with a delicious broth.

Super delicious and juicy, a distinct taste that is unforgettable and will have you craving for more hours later. The short rib is the best I have ever eaten, seriously!! I always have the #1 and #2 for appetizers no matter what my main course is. Do not skip these appetizers, as you will be missing out. I will admit the service can be iffy and you might be hunting down a refill of water, which is the only negative here. The food is so fresh, yummy and clean that it gets very busy, which is why the service can at times be lacking. Just a heads up!!",

As times goes on, maybe I'll update the review in the event their food quality and taste become more memorable.  Located off the strip, the restaurant sits near Chinatown in Las Vegas and just recently opened.   I ordered the Dry Noodle Soup the first time I went and wasn't too impressed. It didn't really have much flavor and oh my god... It had a pretty crappy portion size. The waiter came back to ask for feedback and I gladly told them the same thing. Usually for my dry noodle pho, the portion sizes should be identical, if not the same as the soup version. The serving size was at best 1/2-2/3 my expectations.  I tried the egg rolls and they weren't too bad.  I decided to check out this place again and went the next day ordering Combination Pho (with soup this time). The portions were better, but the soup was bland. My friends  ordered the Oxtail Pho and it was really good and tender. I highly recommend ordering that one.   TL;DR: Very clean pho restaurant (which is a PLUS) with a good amount of options. I wouldn't mind going back! The servers left a great impression too.",

And that is not something available at most Vietnamese restaurants that I have been to.     I took it as a sign for course adjustment and took the hint - ordering their Bo Nuong VI dish. It came with a wide assortment of vegetables - lettuce, carrots, pickled daikon, bean sprouts, mint, basil, and rice roll wraps that you dip in hot water.  Also two sauces accompanied the order for dipping after assembling the rolls  Our waiter gave us a brief explanation and instructions on how to make the roll after grilling the beef.  Seeing that this was a generous portion, we opted to order this dish only and enjoyed the meal over an hour or so.  Marinated beef that were made to order tasted fresh and balanced with the vegetables all made up into a roll.",

And they give you alot of meat.

Fresh Coconut Juice definitely not only quenched my thirst, but it was very refreshing and cooling... and thank goodness they give you a spoon to scoop out the coconut, lol, other places just punch a hole for the straw, but with this you can enjoy the actual coconut meat, so good and good for you! it replenishishes vital electrolytes  Service: Excellent! very friendly, inviting, prompt and attentive! They really care about their customers  They paid attention to every detail of the restaurant, from the white clean modern-plates to the contemporary-decorated walls.

    "text": "I'm not sure why pho places generally close early. Luckily, Viet Noodle Bar is open until 2 am!   The large pho is LARGE. Even for me. Meatballs are delicious, and the rare beef was tender even though I forgot to order it on the side (if you don't specify, they put it in the soup for you). Spring rolls are actually summer rolls (rice paper) and were okay but not great.   Service was prompt and our waters were always filled. I also think it was interesting that they had the TVs on ESPN sports center rather than the Vietnamese channels that normally play in Vietnamese restaurants (not being racist! It's just an observation).  Good pho place if you want a late night fix.",

Sugar cane shrimp vermicelli was my choice I enjoyed the lightness of the proportions as I have to keep my figure.. Lol and the balance of all the flavors was perfect- very refreshing! I also tried the charbroiled pork over rice- absolutely amazing! The marinade they use is delicious!! Definitely must try the fried shrimp roll with sweet and sour sauce, and of course, the fresh spring roll with peanut sauce for starter... We will have to come back for their late night tapas style menu!! It's a hip and trendy spot so I'll definitely be coming back with my party friends to try their cocktails!!",
