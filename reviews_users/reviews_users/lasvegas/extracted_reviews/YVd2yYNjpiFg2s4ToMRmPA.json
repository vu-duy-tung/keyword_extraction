When we got there we weren't even greeted by the lady that was working there, she acted like she was so overwhelmed by helping the little amount of people that were there. Finally when she did help us she wasn't very helpful and didn't explain anything. After ordering it was over 20$ for 3 cinnamon rolls and it took her over 15 minutes to get out order out. They tasted great but I hate going into a new place and not feeling welcome.",

Well, of course I went for plain ol cream cheese frosting... and walnuts with a chunk of cookie dough on top not TOO crazy considering their many options, but next time I will definitely venture out. Love that it's vegan and still appeals to my often anti-vegan tastes. No gluten-free options (yet) but well worth my $5+ and more unique than getting a Cinnabon. Too close to my house and I will definitely be back",

Now for the taste part, I have literally never eaten something so amazingly delicious in my life.

Needless to say, I was apprehensive because how are you gonna make a cinnamon roll without butter??  I was so pleasantly surprised! I got an old skool with caramel frosting. It was amazing. Light and fluffy, the roll itself wasn't overly sweet. The frosting is a little grainy. Next time I would probably skip the frosting and opt for fruit topping. There will definitely be a next time though!",

I had the cinnamon bun with hazelnut vanilla cream frosting and strawberries and walnuts on top. It was absolutely to die for. The pricing wasn't bad at all either. I also brought home to go a regular cinnamon bun with original frosting and apple pie crumble on top... Is your mouth watering yet? This place is a go!",

Someone else came in, I was ready to order, and then someone else walked in and she attended them first and had their cinnamon rolls ready within 3 minutes. My sister and I waited 18 minutes for a simple cinnamon roll with no toppings just the old school cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll itself was good, but the frosting tasted artificial. I've had vegan cinnamon rolls before so the fact that they are vegan doesn't mean they should taste like that. But will not be going here again.",

It wasn't bad, I would just order a different flavor next time. My boyfriend ordered the raspberry frosting topped with raspberries and pie crumble. Let me tell you, it was fantastic!

I had the Groupon deal where you get 2 rolls, a cookie and a brownie.  We added on a couple more cookies and a few of the \"baked fresh yesterday\" rolls.  For the rolls we got cream cheese and cookie dough and peanut butter and Oreo.  Rolls were amazing.  Just as good as the OG Berkeley location.

Most places I've found either have really plain, gross, desserts, or are extremely expensive. I saw Cinnaholic on Yelp, and decided to give it a shot.  I was so impressed! I got a cinnamon roll with tiramisu frosting and cookie dough on top...omg....so good! I ended up sharing it with my fiance because I knew I could not handle eating all the sugar by myself. The roll was delicious, and I could not tell it was vegan. My roll cost me about $5.50, but I could see how it could easily get more expensive with the more toppings you add. But, since this roll fed two people, I thought it was well worth the money.  The girl working the front desk was super sweet and recommended me her favorites. I joined their rewards programming, because I am DEFINITELY going back - soon!",

    "text": "So Cinnaholic was the last stop on food tour night with my cousin. It was both of our first time. I always wanted check CInnaholic out since close to my house and heard about it getting boast on Shark Tank. The whole concept gourmet cinnamon rolls?? It peaks interest. The only cinnamon rolls pops in my mind is Cinnabon or the ones get in roll in grocery store in a tube then lay them on cookie sheet pan to cook. I was excited check out the hype.   They have few different ones that can choose from all in a really awesome display all done up finish product. You also have the option that can make your own masterpiece. You just start the base with the cinnamon roll and the rest is whatever your heart desires. The smores really caught my eye. That the one I went with and my cousin went with made his own up. I forget what he came up with something with lemon flavor. Maybe. It was no way as artistic or had as much components then my smores. It was good. It had all the things associate with smores marshmallow, granola cracker, and chocolate. The only thing that was weird for me. The alcohol or if they do in the sauce on top was strong. I was thinking man getting drunk on cinnamon roll. The portion size is huge. Neither one of us were able to finish our cinnamon roll. I would almost say sharing is good idea if not super hungry. They also offer gluten free ones.  It small place not many seats. I am fan of the checkerboard old school dinner vibe get from the inside. You place order and then pick it up at the end of the counter. It open area so can watch your masterpiece come together. All the cinnamon rolls served in basket lines with checkerboard paper. The floor has that same look. Not sure if recall seeing fountain machine. They have refrigerator up front with lot of different options comes to bottle drinks from healthy ones coconut water, smart water, and more. They do have a widescreen in one corner of the restaurant. It might be little hard to find in the shopping center cause right in the middle. It located right across from Chuck E Cheese in the shopping center.  I enjoyed my Cinnaholic. Nothing that blew me away with the whole gourmet cinnamon roll. If have urge for cinnamon roll. One that not just soaked in all frosting and sugar more sugar. Gourmet or something different no doubt Cinnaholic is way to go!",

    "text": "A Vegan Cinnamon Roll Bakery - so crazy! Walking in, the place has a good atmosphere with music, Halloween decor and a great seating area. The menu was easy to read it, the hardest part was deciding on what frosting and topping I wanted!   I was highly disappointed in our female cashier, tall brunette with her hair in a bun. She seemed very moody especially after my friend showed her the Groupon she bought the other day (one of the reasons we came here in the first place - she wanted a good deal and I'm vegan) She wasn't helpful at all she just recommended I add coconut after I decided on blueberry and was in such a hurry even though we were the only customers inside. She NEVER asked us if we were dining in or taking it to go she just marked it as to go.  The two gentlemen working were so nice especially the handsome guy with the glasses and Star Wars shirt  who might be the franchise owner because his customer service was on f'n point! The girl cashier walked away after my friend was done ordering and I actually wanted to buy one to go for my roommate but she wasn't texting me back but luckily the guy came over and I told him that she just said pumpkin spice and he then recommended 5 different toppings explaining why they balance well! I went with pie crumble and he even signed me up for the rewards program and explained how it worked!!   The other gentleman accidentally put on pecans instead of pie crumble by mistake and instead of just giving it to me they both asked if it was ok (never know if someone as nut allergies!!) and I explained it wasn't for me, that's why I picked pie crumble and they made a fresh one all over again, which is better than picking them all off lol  My blueberry with coconut roll was delicious! The coconut didn't balance as well as I thought it would but it still worked. My friend ordered a maple with graham crackers. She wished it was less chunks of crackers and more of a crumble. And we both enjoyed the chocolate chip cookie! But it's super disappointing they didn't have any brownies ready for us to try!   Overall I will totally be back! Would have gave them 5 stars had the female cashier been more friendly and outgoing. Especially over a Groupon...don't put out a Groupon if you don't want new customers, it's not just for cheap people it's to help people discover you!!! But maybe next time they'll earn it",

She said hello as if someone threatened her to speak. She walked away from us which was a sign she didn't want to help us. She didn't ask if we wanted anything or if we had any questions. So, I just walked out. In an empty restaurant, you should be warm and friendly when ANYONE walks in. I will spend my hard earned money someplace else.",

I'm not vegan guys, let's just get that straight, but cinnamon rolls are very important to my cravings :) and this place is closer to me than any Cinnabon location.   After LVAC I went straight to Cinnaholic (then went to get BBQ). It was some time after 2pm and we were the only ones in there, I was kind of expecting it to be crowded, maybe we just got lucky. The young employee was very helpful and she was nice. Gotta love great customer service right!   I ordered the Old School, which is a classic cinnamon roll. It was my first time there, I had to to find out how the Classic stacked up. It was SOO good!! I inhaled it. I have to say...I really don't like the cardboard container they put it in...it's too hard to lick the frosting out of it.   We also ordered a Carmel Apple, which tasted like those Carmel apple lollipops, yum! And we had the special of the day which was Sucker for Smuckers...I think, it was peanut butter with grape drizzle and gram crackers. I can't remember exactly what was in it, but it was really good!!   We bought a brownie too but, I'm saving that for tomorrow...I have a feeling I'll be very pleased :)",

    "text": "Myself and 4 friends were on vacation in Las Vegas, we live in Los Angeles, California, after having dinner in downtown on Friday night 3/17/2017, we were all super excited to try out your store (2 of my friends are vegan). We were finished with dinner at about 8:40pm and your store closed at 10:00pm, so before making the approximately 28 minute drive, one of my friends suggested we call to confirm you close at 10:00pm before we make the long drive, yelp is known to have incorrect store hours from time to time. I called and spoke with a female employee, I mentioned that we are driving from about 30 minutes out and wanted to confirm the store closed at 10:00pm and that it wouldn't be a problem that 5 of us would arrive by 9:15-9:20:pm, she replied \" Yes we close at 10:00pm and coming at that time would be fine as all our ingredients are made fresh so we have everything in stock, come on over we look forward to seeing you\", I replied Thank you and we were on our way. We arrived at the store at approximately 9:20pm, a car full of 5 of us, we walked into the store and the young man at the cashier said to us \"Just want to let you guys know we only have 1 roll left\", we were in complete shock and assumed he was joking with us but he went on to confirm that only one roll was left, I stated to him that we just called about 25 mins ago and your employee mentioned nothing about running out of rolls as even a possibility, he apologized and said there is nothing he can but offering for us to buy the single roll left. As you can expect after driving 30 minutes we were all pretty upset and disappointed especially after taking the initiative to call ahead of time to confirm, definitely affected the mood for the rest of the evening. The female employee who we spoke with on the phone, immediately went to the back room after she noticed we were complaining to the cashier and didn't even have the courtesy to come out and acknowledge her mistake and apologize to our group. I had to request the cashier to have her come out so I could question her why she would tell us one thing over the phone and then this happens, she apologized to me and then with an attitude stated \"Have a Goodnight\". This is by far one of the worst customer service experience I have dealt with, this is completely unacceptable, your management team needs to really do a better job of conveying to retail store location employees to alert customers who call in that due to a limited supply there is a possibility of rolls running out, I'm getting upset just having to take the time out of my busy day to write this letter to your company and live this disastrous night over again. I'm disappointed because was eager to try your Vegan Rolls but more disappointed for my 2 Vegan Friends who could not wait to try them as they were talking about visiting your location for the prior 2 days we in Las Vegas. I wrote a letter to the corporate office regarding our experience, the management team wrote back and stated they confirmed our story with the store location and employees, they stated they couldn't predict this would happen and only offered an apologize, an apology isn't sufficient here when your store dropped the ball BIG TIME. I gave them one more opportunity asking if they can make this situation right for me and my friends as an apology is just not acceptable in this case, the never responded again and here I am letting the yelp community know how this establishment treats and looks after its customer, don't waste your time driving here,  CAUTION STAY AWAY I would not recommend anyone come here and we definitely will NOT BE COMING BACK!",

Service is really nice and friendly and the place itself is very clean.  The only thing I didn't like were their frostings. And I honestly don't think I'd like any of their frostings besides vanilla, which is what originally comes on cinnamon buns. I got butterscotch but it was way too sweet. However, when I tried my friend's frostings, their's was also too sweet. They also drown your cinnamon bun in frosting like crazy. Make sure to sample before choosing your frosting!  Maybe one day I'll come back to this place if I'm craving some fresh cinnamon buns but will skip on frostings next time.",

Got cream cheese frosting and pecans. Warm and yummy, but didnt taste the cream cheese. Sister got hazelnut icing and pie crumble. Hers was ok it tasted like a fall scented candle lol. Staff is super friendly and fast. Great location, but dont think I would come again because the actual roll isnt soft and flaky like Cinnabon. Toppings are .50 each, so a bit pricey. I think they could benefit from doing different prices for 2 or 3 toppings and selling coffee. Wouldnt come back unless I was craving cinnamon rolls.",

There's a display case right as you walk in that has some cinnamon rolls that are already made with some admittedly delicious sounding combinations (e.g. the pumpkin spice latte cinnamon roll for my inner basic b*tch).   Cashier was pretty friendly and gave me some suggestions as to what some of her favorite combinations were, and I ended up getting a amaretto almond roll. They do give out samples of the frosting on a wooden popsicle stick, which is pretty helpful.   No complains about service or friendliness, but at almost $6 a bun, it just wasn't really worth it for me. The cinnamon bun dough itself was not bad, but nothing to gush about, and the frosting was just way too sickly sweet for me. Maybe go easy on how sweet you make the icing?   Another suggestion would be to get better coffee! Anything that's sitting in one of those coffee thermoses all day just cannot be good.",

    "text": "2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 71/100  If you love Cinnabon, you'll LOVE this place!   Been dying to try this place. I heard a lot of great things about it, and plus, they were on Shark Tank! I told my Hawai'i friends who were visiting about it. So glad they chose this place to get dessert after lunch.    All cinnamon rolls are made fresh daily. I wanted to try the baby buns, but they were still baking it when we got there.   Here, you get to choose your own frosting and toppings. They have a huge list and variety of frostings and toppings to choose from. They also have popular combos in their display case if you have a hard time deciding.   Even though I can't have much sugar and they didn't have the baby buns ready, I opted to get a regular roll with chai frosting and gingersnap cookies! Which is an onoliscious combination. I LOVED IT. The roll is huge! I only ate 1/4 of it. The roll was freshly made and soft. The frosting was seductively oozing down the roll. Yummmm.   I didn't feel a huge sugar spike, so based on my experience I'm assuming it's healthier and has less sugar compared to Cinnabon.    I also appreciated the way it's served if you dine in. A reusable plastic container and thick tissue paper (not sure what they're called) that can easily be packed in a to-go box if you can't finish it. No mess, no fuss. Easy clean up. I love how they use recyclable and compostable to-go boxes and not styrofoam.  My friends LOVED it and said they will come back to bring some home before they leave.   Service was great, helpful and friendly. They also had a big screen tv towards the back with Friends on.   There are only a few places I get cravings for and this is one of them. I will definitely be back! I'll have to pace myself with this one.",

Walking it, it was a little overwhelming trying to decide what to get but the lady on staff walked us through the menu. I opted the Twix cinnamon roll and my husband got a custom roll with Oreos on it. The staff is very friendly and the cinnamon rolls are so delicious.",

This place found a way.  Gourmet cinnamon rolls. Pick your flavor of frosting and toppings .. Viola!!! You have extra yummy goodness. Flavor of frostings include vanilla, chocolate, chai, peanut butter, caramel, pumpkin spice, etc. Toppings range from strawberries (fresh), blueberries, pretzels, coconut, chocolate chips, etc.   We ordered 6 so I figured it would take awhile but they were quick and the cinnamon rolls was fresh and hot. Super soft too! I had the chai frosting with strawberries. I will definitely go back!  They have baby rolls too for the little ones!",

    "text": "Move over Cinnabon.... Cinnaholic is the new Cinnamon Roll place in town. I decided to try this place out based on the reviews of other Yelpers.  Upon entering this delicious store, your greeted by a group of friendly and helpful employees. They explained the concept of customizing your own cinnamon roll with your choice of frosting and toppings. Pricing per roll depended how much you put on your roll. I was overwhelmed with selection that they offered. However one of their employee suggested that I try out one of their specialty that are displayed in the pastry case. At that moment, my mind told me to get All but I ended up with a Pumpkin Pecan flavored cinnamon roll. Judging by the ones that were displayed it was more than enough for one person to consume but it depends how big of a sweet tooth you have. I initially wanted mine to go but with all the sweet aromatic scent in the store I decide to eat mine like a Heffer!  Actually, I grab a seat toward the back counter where you pick up your delicious roll and got a few essentials like a fork and napkins to savor my cinnamon roll. From the very first bite to the last bite was simply delicious and couldn't believe that I was enjoying a Vegan gourmet style cinnamon roll. The roll was soft throughout and wasn't dry with a hint of crispy texture that was perfectly balanced with the sweet frosting. FYI-If your not much of a frosting person you can adjust the amount you would like. I definitely will be back to try so more out and create my own!",

I love the variety of frosting and toppings and I can wait to go back and try more combinations! Nothing was too sweet and flavors did not clash.  The texture of the cinnamon roll was soft and pretty good for it being a vegan dessert!    There is a rewards program that is monitored through your phone number.

The cinnamon rolls were way better than their famous shopping mall sister shop. They were fresh and could be customized to your liking.  The hazelnut spread was good, but way too thick as well as the other frosted rolls we got. If you're looking for something a little less sweet/heavy ask for light frosting. They have premade flavors as well as build your own. The shop was on Shark Tank! Never did I think, this is good.... for being Vegan. Cinnaholic was good for Vegan, it was good compared to non-Vegan.",

I bought two rolls on my first visit: bananas foster with pecans and I  created the second roll had cream cheese, chocolate, caramel and pecans. Both were beyond delicious. My daughter also created her own with vanilla frosting and Oreos.  We were in Las Vegas for 4 days and I had to return before we left for more cinnamon rolls goodness. I joined the loyalty club on my first visit even though there isn't a store in my State. I'm glad I did because I earned a free roll on my visit.

There are so many combos of frostings and toppings that I was a little overwhelmed, but the employee was patient to answer my questions and give some suggestions.  Expect to wait a while for your order, especially if there is a crowd. I took mine to go because I knew that I would need to share my rolls and I am glad I did. At 650 calories not including toppings, I can't imagine having these rolls more than a few times a year. I would equate them to Pink Box donuts. Your mouth loves the taste, but you heart can't handle the ingredients. I would suggest less frosting to better appreciate the flavor of the toppings and roll. It was very messy so use a fork. I cut my 4 rolls in fourths and family members were able to try a sample. The brownie was very gooey- too much for my liking. The cookie was perfect-like something from my childhood. The store was clean and the employees were friendly. Parking can get crowded with all the other stores nearby so careful. Thankfully for my waistline I am only in this area for yoga class so that should keep my visits to Cinnaholic to a minimum but I would definitely bring out of town people here for the treats. Check their social media to see their seasonal flavors.",

    "text": "I like a good old fashioned cinnamon roll, I had to try these but kept thinking are they using all these different toppings to hide a crappy pastry? So I went with something pretty simple, Carmel frosting with walnuts, the cinnamon roll was soft and fresh, I like to \"unwrap\" my cinnamon roll and eat from the outside in, it was just as delicious on the outside as it was on the inside. I liked the carmel frosting, not overly sweet.  It was a nice size too. My only complaint was that the walnuts were too \"whole\", they needed to be crushed up a bit more. I'm not sure of the one my husband got but it was a messy one! Had pieces of brownie on top and chocolate sauce, he loved it though, said he'd get it again. Our big disappointment was with customer service, I read all these great reviews about how friendly they were but the girl that waited on us was not great. It felt like we were bothering her, it was an effort to answer our questions. My husband ended up adding on a cup of coffee, which both carafes were empty when he tried them. Finally a guy from the back helped him out and filled them but the coffee was bad and had coffee ground floating in it. I would definitely go back for the cinnamon rolls, its what they are known for. Their name isn't Coffeeholic or Happyholic!",

Anyways, the cashier was friendly and let my sister and I try any flavor we wanted. I had amaretto and blueberries while she had blueberry pie or something like that. They were both okay.   I had bought a coffee along with my dessert and really disliked it after my first sip. I hesitated to ask for a refund for it, but it was just so distasteful. I kindly asked another man.. I think supervisor maybe? For a refund. He seemed annoyed that I would ask for such a thing, and actually LIED to me saying that he processed the refund. My sister is a little less shy than I am and asked why her e-receipt had not changed. He said \"oh let me check\" and all of a sudden she got a notification for a refund. What a JERK.  I will never be back, nor will I recommend this place to ANYONE.",

Cinnaholic was always on my list of new places to try, but I never got around to it because I kept correlating cinnamon rolls with Cinnabon, which is not the most exciting cinnamon roll. I finally decided to give it a try and boy, was I surprised! I ordered the Old School roll to test the waters and I was immediately hooked. The cinnamon roll was big, light, and well balanced in terms of flavor. After I tried the original roll with vanilla frosting, I became more adventurous with their flavors. Every time I went in, I tried a different flavor combo. From seasonal flavors to fruity ones like Triple Berry, I ended up finding my favorite - a cinnamon roll with banana cream frosting. No matter how simple or how crazy your tastebuds may be, you CAN'T go wrong here. Everything is customizable and made to suit anyone's flavor profile. Cinnaholic is a guilt-free way to indulge because you know that no animals were harmed to provide us with such delectable treats! All in all, I'm a big, BIG fan and I'll definitely be back for more!",

Like, I had to take two sips of water for every bite I took just to wash it down.   The concept is great - it's like the Coldstone of cinnamon buns. I also love that everything is vegan and fresh. They provided phone chargers at every table, which is a nice touch. It's a cute little place with retro decor.   It's worth checking out if you're a fan of super sweet things.

I always just get the regular glaze and I can never eat it all. Their cookie dough add on is really good just on it's own.

It was our first time trying this place - I understand it was late and don't expect a super upbeat person but just a  tip- wished our experience was better as in the customer service aspect... the teenage kid seemed he hated life and his job. Wasn't very helpful with recommendations or what was popular. Overall I give Four stars for the actual Cinnaholic Cinnabon was delicious!",

First, I just want to say I'm someone who hates driving and cinnaholic is just about on the opposite end of my part of town- but yet, I still make the trip for these amazing cinnamon rolls!   Cinnaholic offers a ready to pick menu or build your own options. If you choose to build your own you start with your option of roll and work up to all your toppings. The roll itself is $4.75, frosting is 25 cents, and each topping is 50 cents. They offer such a variety of frosting from your typical Vanilla to Amaretto and banana cream!   We had a Twix roll- off the set menu, and a build your own topped with cookie dough, brownie, and chocolate drizzle. Both were equally as delicious!   I cannot wait for the new location to open in Henderson, definitely will be a regular!",

I wanted to try it out since I've always loved cinnamon pecan roll from Cinnabon, but unfortunately it was nothing like it.   It tasted okay, but expected the pecans to be candied and bigger in size, not chopped up in tiny pieces. The sweetness was a little much, but make sure you drink a lot of water with it otherwise you'll get cottonmouth.   Overall they had a great playlist playing and brought back old school memories!",

It was yummy but honestly very VERY sweet. I tried the a beautiful Amaretto roll with almonds, raspberries, and chocolate chips. The Amaretto gave the creation a very nice flavor but it was a sugar overload. I also tried a friend's chocolate cheesecake (I considered getting that as well) and did not care for it... The rolls did not taste too fresh either, that may have contributed to my disintrest in returning. In all fairness, we were there about 6-7pm. May be th4e rolls are made in the morning for the day? Staff was super helpful and patient with two indecisive patrons and did not mind chatting. Tons of various flavors and toppings. I really want to give Cinnaholic benefit of the doubt but they are not for me.",

And I mean reeeaally sweet. Even though all orders are customizable, and you could ask for light frosting like I did, it's still crazy sweet! I would not recommend coming here if you're looking for a more light dessert, unless you'll be sharing with a group of people.  My fam and I ordered 3 different kinds. All with light frosting. They were made to order and all came out fresh, warm, and gooey. Reminds me of everyone's favorite mall eatery, Cinnabon. :] The interior space and seating is pretty limited, so coming here with a big group may not be accommodating.  All in all, this is the one-stop shop you should go to if you're craving for that soft, sugary, extra sweet, and melted frosting cinnamon roll of a dessert! Did I get your senses working? LOL",

If only vegan meant calorie free....This was one of the stops on a sugar crawl with friends. I'm not typically in this part of town so the crawl gave me the push to venture over this way and I'm so glad that I did.  The options for these tasty rolls are impressive. There are about 20 frosting options and 20 topping options. Several ideas for creations designed by Cinnaholic are displayed next to the register. So helpful for those that can be overwhelmed by so many options.  We shared the Bananas Foster. Wow! The roll was good and the frosting on top was really delicious. I absolutely loved the flavor of the frosting. The bananas foster part was really tasty too. The roll was not tiny, it would be a large dessert for one and would probably be best split between two.   It'd be cool if they had a mini roll option as well. I would love a way to try multiple flavors without eating more than the equivalent of one roll. Mini rolls would be a good way to do that or even a mini roll sampler.  I'm already looking for reasons that I can return to this area to have my next delicious roll!",

My roll was covered in a generous layer of vanilla frosting Toppings included a handful of blueberries with a layer of sugar/cinnamon and oat crumble The roll was large, filling, soft, and super sweet.  Yum, yum, and more yum. These delicious buns will be swimming circles around your cinnaholic heart.   Overall: I enjoyed my cinnaholic bun and will definitely be back to sample other flavors.

I had the caramel frosting with apples and it was SO good! Not too sweet, apples were nice and fresh and it tasted great. Can't wait to go back for the other million combos!",

As a first timer, the menu can be overwhelming. There are just so many options. And while you can just go with a classic cinnamon roll, that seems to defeat the purpose. Regardless of what you order, though, it's going to be awesome.  These are absolutely decadent and delicious. I had the Twix cinnamon roll, and my husband ordered one with vanilla frosting, pecans, and caramel sauce. I'm glad it's a bit of a drive for me to get here, otherwise I would come a lot more. They are reasonably priced, so I wouldn't feel bad about it either!   I thought it was interesting that they don't seem to advertise that these are vegan. You don't really see it anywhere on the menu. I wouldn't have known unless I had read the Yelp reviews. As a nonvegan, I appreciated that they weren't all in your face about it.  The space is very clean and service was extremely quick. We came around 3:30 pm on a Monday and it was pretty empty, so if you want to beat the crowds, I'd recommend coming around then.",

The staff is great and now there a rewards program that allows you to earn free cinnamon rolls. That's great news! Or bad if you consider all the cinnamon rolls I'll be buying lol... Its far from me but it's an easy drive there and back because it's right off the 215.  Go there today and try a cinnamon roll if you haven't had one yet. And then.... Take your friends.

I've tried coming twice late nights before they closed, and they have closed way before their closing time. Maybe it's just me, but if some place says they close at 8PM or 9PM, you stay open till those hours and clean after.  Today's visit started with me explaining to the cashier it was my first time. She was kind and said start with a frosting and topping or pick from the display case. I thought cool already made styles I'll do that. She rung me up and said it's $6.50. I thought holy sh!t! That's a lot for a cinnamon bun. And needless to say 10 minutes later not the worth. It was empty and not filling. And just overly sweet. The flavor I chose was caramel coffee cake. I tasted zero caramel, absolutely zero coffee, and I'm so weirded out it had granola on there. That's a really weird topping. I would expect more strudel clusters. Needless to say I don't cone back and urge to change your prices. $6.50 for a cinnamon bun.... ridiculous.  Oh and it would be nice too if the employees didn't rant about their personal lives, and be drinking water while making my food.",

    "text": "I had been hearing a lot about how amazing this place was so I was really excited to give it a try. Neither location is particularly close to me, so it was a must when I found myself on this side of town.  I am not Vegan, but I am always excited for that option, especially if it as just as good as the original.  I went with a friend and we each ordered a a cinnamon roll and then shared a tub of cookie dough. The cinnamon rolls are cooked to order so they are warm and gooey when you get them. I liked the concept of being able to choose frosting/toppings to customize you roll. I chose maple frosting with walnuts and my friend opted for cake batter frosting with cookie dough topping.  Mine was good, but far from spectacular. My maple frosting wasn't nearly maple-y enough and the walnuts on top were whole, not chopped, which made eating a little difficult. My friend felt that the roll was a bit doughy, but overall liked it. They are someone who normally wouldn't try anything that even says vegan...and they didn't know what they were eating was vegan...so the fact that they liked it says a lot. Neither of us like that their cookie dough topping was literally a raw cookie thrown on top.  The roll itself left me a little conflicted. As far as cinnamon rolls go, it was average. However, given that it was vegan, and knowing that vegan baked goods can be obviously not so good...I felt like that should get special consideration. If I judge against other cinnamon rolls I would give this a B-. If I judge against other vegan desserts I've had, I would bump it up to an A-.  The little tub of cookie dough was excellent and neither of us could detect any difference in taste from a grocery store tube or something you would make at home. Taste and texture were spot on.   I love that there are so many vegan/vegetarian options popping up all over town. Even without being vegan, I like having options. This is definitely a great option for a quick breakfast or dessert!  I like that they have multiple locations with evening hours. If you're a fan of cinnamon rolls you should definitely check them out.",

Can't wait until they expand to Toronto!!",

When we walked in there was a little girl ( her daughter) jumping up and down on the counter. We weren't greeted when we walked in but the woman was counting the money drawer, totally understandable. But when she finished, we still were not greeted.  Thats not okay.  After standing there, I asked what all was in one of the pre made rolls, I barely could hear her answer.  When I asked her to repeat, she had an attitude and continued to respond.  If they were busy that would be one thing, but we were the only people in there.  Very disappointed in the service.",

    "text": "Well I have to say this establishment is AS ADVERTISED. I am starting my Las Vegas area VEGAN Food Excursion and this was stop #1. I mean if someone would have told me that Vegas would have such AWESOME VEGAN Options I would have called them crazy. Last year when we became Timeshare Owners out here we found such GEMS as The Pizza Kitchen....Ronald's Donuts.....Violette's Vegan.....and C.R.E.A.M. to name just a few. So when we made our plans this year the wife and I decided to hit several more VEGAN hot spots here and first on that list would be Cinnaholic. I decided to start with something simple.....roll with Vegan Cream Cheese......and Vegan Caramel......the RESULT = DELICIOUS. The wife had a roll with Vegan Cream Cheese and Pecans.....and did I mention by the way.....EVERYTHING.....and I do mean EVERYTHING on the MENU is VEGAN. This location is within walking distance of my timeshare property which is a huge plus but considering it was a Saturday and the place was packed we didn't know what to expect. Well I am pleased to say the customer service was excellent and while there was a wait because they make these rolls \"MADE TO ORDER\" style.....it was definitely worth it.  Two things to remember as I conclude this review.....they don't print paper receipts so remember to have them email it or text it to you. Secondly they have these awesome chargers for all different devices at each table so for those of you who just have to have your social media fix.....your covered. They have a great rewards program that I signed up for.....it took about 5 seconds. Why only 5 seconds you ask? Well you just put in your phone number and BOOM your in. You will receive a text message confirming your registration and your receive points on every transaction you make.....and all you have to do is enter your number every time you come in......no cards to carry or apps to download......AWESOME Right?   One last thing.....I promise....LOL.....We also had an awesome COOKIE for 2 Bucks.....and they sell mini buns....cinnacakes.....and even cookie dough for your sweet tooth pleasure.  Well I could go on and on.....but just get there quick.....fast.....and in a hurry and you will see what I am talking about. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!!",

My bf & I have been going here for a while and what keeps us coming back is how delicious their \"Old Skool\" Roll is, which is just their basic cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting on top. We are huge Cinnabon lovers and this place definitely fills in the void and the fact that it's vegan is even more of a bonus! We have tried their other rolls like their Cookies & Cream and Banana Foster but were WAY too sweet for our liking, so we just stick with the straight up, no fuss Old Skool Roll.   I do love the concept of the place and how you can make your own custom cinnamon roll by selecting your frosting (25 cents each) and your toppings (50 cents each) and they have a ton of choices! They also have other baked goods like cookies, brownies, etc. Also, they have a rewards system where you put in your phone number which is super convenient instead of having a stamp card. But I do warn that if you use their Yelp check in offer for 5% off your order and it's less than $5, your points don't count which is a bummer (I wish they told me beforehand).   I do agree with other reviews that this place is pretty pricey for just a cinnamon roll but definitely give it a try if you're looking for something new and sweet to eat!",

I'm not even on a vegan diet, I just love the quality of flavors and ingredients. I have been in when it's been busy and slow and got the same level of service each time, they're always polite and as quick as they can be.  The different combinations of flavors are awesome, and I am a sucker for their caramel frosting- OMG. Pictured here is their blueberry pie cinnamon roll, and then one I built with caramel frosting, bananas, and pecans. So good, any time of day!  The one thing I wish they had would be some sort of gluten free option- I know it's hard to make too much gluten free but to have maybe one type of roll/frosting GF would be a huge bonus. Other than that, no complaints! Yum yum.",

Went back at 10:30 and the line made a circle around the small inside lobby. Cute decor, large screen tv on back wall playing music videos. Only a few tables but the to-go business was booming. You choose your frosting flavor and then a topping if you like and all the rolls are baked and served while still warm. An amazing feat of timing. Rolls were soft, good flavor, and not a bad wait considering the line. My box was a mess, frosting all over it and it got on the seat in my car but I just licked it off. Lol $5.50 each with flavored frosting and 1 topping.",

The toppings were really gooey and sticky and delicious, u definitely need a fork to dig in! I love little shops like this cause everything is made with thought and care and it shows in the quality.

But wait, they are just off the freeway entrance ramp I take after going to the salon every week. DOABLE!  Swung by today. Spent more time looking for the store in the giant shopping center than actually being in the store! Once I found it (hint - 3rd store to the left of Tropical Smoothie Cafe), I went in and ordered:  -caramel frosting w/chocolate drizzle  -butterscotch frosting w/apples.  Extremely nice young male counterperson started telling me all about the vegan-ness. I told him I was extremely familiar with the concept and didn't need to convince me to try it!  The frosting is more like a thin glaze, not a thick frosting for cakes. More gooeyness! I scarfed those puppies down like there's no tomorrow.  While I was there, several groups of people came in. He went thru his \"vegan spiel\" with each group. Only 2 of the 7 or 8 made a face and left. Several were incredulous that you can actually bake without eggs, milk or butter. One bite was all it took to convince them.",

She argued with me & said they don't like doing that even though I explained to her my friend got rolls from them before like that. So I then asked if I could get them all with different frosting & toppings & she said yes that's the chef's choice. I said ok pick whatever combination you want just make sure they are ALL different. I get the box & she did the same frosting & topping in sets of 4. I told her that wasn't what I asked for & how can we fix this & she said we can't fix it & I should have been more specific. I then explained that I thought by saying I want everyone one of them different that was specific enough. She then told me that I agreed to chef's choice & that's how she choose to do them because it is easier for her to make more of the same kind. A little side bar...the place was dead inside so it wasn't that she had so much to do. Needless to say, I will never buy from them again!",

We were l able to try different flavors and they were all amazing. Our friends are still talking about them!!!

It's very quiet inside but for the back table as you can see the TV with cartoons on it for the kiddos.

Now open for a year in The Mall at Grand Canyon with additional outposts in Henderson and Centennial, a win on the television program \"Shark Tank\" apparently enough to take an idea for DIY-Cinnamon Rolls mainstream, it was just past two o'clock that the small store was found to be empty, a smell of Cinnamon in the air and two young women quickly offering greetings with smiles on their faces.  In reality a simple concept not dissimilar to Fro-yo or Shaved Ice, fresh Baked Cinnabuns ready to be crowned with Frosting plus a vast array of toppings, guests at Cinnaholic are welcome to choose from over forty suggested varieties or build their own piece-by-piece, the former seemingly best to see how their ideas fare and one Bun selected to personal preference while the other was deferred to the servers.  Not a spot where one should expect to wait long, the \"Straight from the Oven\" slogan on a back wall sort of misleading as previously baked Rolls behind the counter are visibly extracted from a warmer, it was with The Rugrats playing on a television that two non-Cinnamon Roll options were tasted while waiting just five minutes, the Chocolate Chip Cookie lacking any crispiness much like Chewy Chips Ahoy while Cinnaholic's Brownie fares far better, the dense fudgey square one of Sin City's best and a deal at just $2.50.  Setting aside more than half of the Cookie and Brownie as Cinnamon Rolls were passed across the counter, one for now and another for later, it was with mild amusement that claims from others about the Dough appearing 'raw' were confirmed upon cutting into the \"Nutty Professor,\" a topping of what tasted more like Salty Caramel than \"Butterscotch\" pleasantly mellowed by toasted Nuts but the texture and color beneath not dissimilar from Wonderbread and thus off-putting, an identical situation found in the \"Crunchy PB & J\" which, although edible, does not justify the price compared to Cinnabon let alone better Cinnamon Rolls found elsewhere.  **Generally put off by eateries that hide behind claims of \"Vegan\" as though it means healthy, the fact that *most* should realize a Cinnamon Roll is never anything but an indulgence, it is more Cinnaholic's base that makes their product unappealing and in a city with the likes of CRAFTkitchen, Mothership, Joe Maxx and others making great Vegan Baked Goods there is really no reason to go here save for perhaps a Brownie or desire to watch Rugrats.",

You can customize the roll however you want it and they have like a bazillion topping options. The guy behind the counter was super helpful. It was crazy sweet tho so next time I will be sharing it with someone because wow! Also it's a little pricey but worth the amount we got 2 rolls for $14 which is the same or less than cinnabon.",

Rahiem was awesome taking my order over the phone, friendly, gathering the correct information and giving me an estimated time when it's ready, 2:30. He even allowed me to use three coupons; $3 off, free cookie and free old school.   When I arrived at 2:30 nothing was ready. Alicia said the dough for the baby buns was still proofing, which I understand it takes time to cook, but don't give me an estimate time when it ready and it's completely off. It would be another 17 minutes. I told them how I'm traveling with these prior, I have enough time, but now I'm going to be running late to the airport.   I ended up re-ordering regular buns which they had a few ready already, not the baby buns, and Alicia would not honor Rahiem using the 3 coupons. She wouldn't even give me anything to compensate for messing up my order and wasting my time, until I made a big deal and she settled with giving a free cookie.   Horrible service, give your customers a correct time estimate, have your products ready and accept responsibility for being at fault.",

There is a ton to select from in each category so there are so many ways to make your cinnamon roll.   There is also a build menu that they have created so you can order off that as well.  We tried the sticky bun creation and it wasn't very good. I had a bite and that was it. The roll itself wasn't soft, has probably been baked for quite some time.   There was so much they added on top which made it sooo sweet, yes I know I got a sticky bun cinnamon roll which will be sweet I'm aware, but too sweet is not good.   I would prefer a Cinnabon over this the next time I'm craving a cinnamon roll.",

I assumed they had some vegan options but was told all their desserts are vegan. I'm really excited about that! I can't wait to try a different combo since there's so many. You can choose your sauces in your toppings etc. take a look at the pictures and go in and figure out what you want and try different things every time you go. That's what makes this place fun!  Update - I went to this place again with my cousin. I told her how amazing this place was. Unfortunately, this time our experience was not the greatest. It was November 28, 2018 near closing. I would say around 9:30 PM. My cousin and I went in and they were already putting the chairs up on the tables. I knew they wanted to go home as soon as 10 o'clock came so we tried to make a decision quickly. My cousin asked what was popular to the cashier girl and she basically gave us an I don't know with a bad attitude. My cousin and I looked at each other because we were kind of shocked at her response. I mentioned that my cousin liked strawberries. I then asked the cashier if she had something like a strawberries and cream. She again replied with a bad attitude I don't know. She obviously didn't want to help us. I then went on yelp and showed her a photo of what I was thinking was a strawberries and cream. She just looked at me and said nothing. So I then proceeded to figure it out myself. I asked her if she could put cream cheese, strawberries and chocolate carob chips on the cinnamon bun for both of us. Which she did. I was disappointed in the customer service that we received that night. I was also a little embarrassed that my cousin had that experience with me. My first experience here was a different story but I think it was because the owner or manager was there. I have a feeling that when the owner/manager is not there, their customer service goes out the window.",

Once inside, we noticed that it was very cute and quaint. We were immediately greeted and I told the guy that it was our first time there. He informed us that they make gourmet cinnamon rolls and that you can have any type of frosting or topping that you like. For those who like a basic cinnamon roll, they have those, too. I ended up ordering the Old Skool Cinnamon Roll (the basic choice), but I had them drizzle half vanilla icing and half almond icing and add a light sprinkling of pecans and a light drizzle of chocolate. My friend also ordered an Old Skool, but with cream cheese frosting. Those damn things are amazing! It was warm, the frostings really brought it together, especially that almond frosting! I have to definitely get that, again!  Their frosting flavors range from amaretto, lemon, maple, and cake batter to banana cream, caramel, chai, and marshmallow. Toppings include everything from graham crackers, coconut, cookie dough, and pie crumble to pretzels, rainbow sprinkles, brownie bites, and strawberry or raspberry jam!  They also do party packs, but you have to make sure to order ahead. How cool is that to serve gourmet cinnamon rolls at a party, instead of the traditional cake?!",

The gimmick of a customized cinnamon roll is unusual to me, but I was willing to give it a shot. I had one with Nutella, and chocolate with Graham crackers and other goodies.   The end result is naturally a mess and leaves a lot to be desired. The cinnamon roll itself has very little flavor, and by itself I would imagine it being bland. Perhaps it's because the add these toppings they down play the cinnamon roll flavor?   I'm not sure, but for me, this was a big miss.",

    "text": "Cinnamon is one of my favorite flavors. We were over on the west side on Monday and we noticed a business called Cinnaholic which made \"Gourmet Cinnamon Rolls\" so we just had to stop in and check it out. I got a basic cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting and my GF got one with cream cheese frosting and pecans. We paid about $11.00 for the two rolls.  When I began eating my cinnamon roll I noticed a few things: the frosting tasted off and weird, with a chemical flavor that reminded me of dish soap. The texture of the frosting was not smooth, it was grainy in a way I'd never seen before. The roll itself had virtually no cinnamon taste; it just tasted like a lump of baked dough even though I could see brown streaks in it.  Also, it was impossible for us to tell the difference between the vanilla and the cream cheese frosting; both appeared and tasted exactly the same. I didn't finish my roll because it just didn't taste like a cinnamon roll should, and I wondered how a business that did nothing but make cinnamon rolls could mess this up.  Curious, I went to the company's website and I found the answer: these were vegan cinnamon rolls. There was no notification about this anywhere on the outside or inside the store and the worker who sold us the rolls never mentioned it. It seems they don't want to let their customers know that they're not getting regular cinnamon rolls. This to me is deceptive, bordering on being fraudulent, much like a bar that will sell you a beer and then when you ask why the taste is different after you've paid for it they tell you their beer doesn't contain alcohol.  I have nothing against vegans or veganism. I'm sure people who practice veganism have good reasons for removing animal products from their diets and I respect that. But I am not a vegan, and if a business that sells me a food item that usually contains animal products has removed all animal products from that item I want to know about it before I make a purchase decision. To conceal this knowledge from me is in my view simply a flat-out bait-and-switch and an extremely bad business practice.   In the company website's FAQ one of the questions is \"Why don't you advertise your products as vegan in your store?\" Their answer is \"...To us, living a vegan lifestyle and consuming vegan products is normal! Why treat it like it's not?\"    Well, let's put the shoe on the other foot: If I am a vegan I will want to know if animal products are used in the food I buy, right?  And if I am a vegan am I going to be satisfied with a food vendor telling me \"To us, living a non-vegan lifestyle and consuming animal products is normal! Why treat it like it's not?\"  We all know the answer.",

It had been at least 10 years that I had had a cinnamon roll, And was excited to try this place on the recommendation of a good friend in Las Vegas. Good thing the closest one to me is about 1.5 hrs away!  I would eat a cinnamon roll for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and all snacks. Lol. I ordered the cookies and cream, and ate the whole thing in one sitting. Delicious! My husband ordered the coconut cream pie. To take home, I created my own- caramel frosting, with blueberries, almonds,  pretzel sticks, and coconut. Sounds weird but it was delicious! I ate it 3 days later, and, warmed up, it tasted as fresh as the one I had in the store.  The two young guys who are working in the store were extremely friendly and patient in helping the four of us decide what to order.  I'm not a Las Vegas person, but aside from visiting my two closest friends there, this is one of the food places that I will have to visit the next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "After seeing all of the great reviews on yelp for this place I was eager to give them a try. I noticed they had a Groupon, so I purchased one. The Groupon was good for 2 cinnamon rolls, 1 cookie and 1 brownie, which I liked because it meant I could get a taste of more than one item offered here at Cinnaholic. Employees were friendly and helpful with questions.   There are a couple of things about Cinnaholic that I was not aware of until after visiting this location:   The first... is that this place is 100% vegan. I don't have a whole lot of experience with eating vegan food, but if this is it when it comes to cinnamon rolls, just give me a damn Cinnabon from the mall instead. I understand some people eat vegan and I am glad there are options out there for all of our preferences. The baking sugars are derived from beets, their marshmallows are free of gelatin and other ingredients are all flavored with fruit, spices and plant derived oils according to Cinnaholic.   The second... is that they were on ABC's Shark Tank. They accepted a deal to ship their rolls nationwide, but then decided to decline the deal and focus on opening more storefronts.   So the cinnamon roll is $4.75 and if you add flavored frosting it's an additional $0.25 cents and an additional $0.50 for each topping. Ouch! That's about the same price (or more depending on how many toppings) as one Cinnabon at the mall or 2 Cinnabon inside Maverick. Yes, I know one is made vegan and the other isn't, but I'm wanting a tasty roll and not caring about beet sugars or cane sugars, just texture and taste matter to me. The cinnamon rolls I tried here had lemon frosting with fresh blueberries and chocolate frosting with Oreo cookies. The lemon frosting was really disappointing because the lemon flavor was very faint. I really loved the amount of blueberries they added and they tasted great. The chocolate with cookies was surprisingly good (hubby picked this one) however the rolls themselves were not great. They bake them in a toaster like oven and they come out fresh every 20 minutes, but after that long of a wait I expected a far better tasting cinnamon roll. I didn't care for the outer part of the roll it was kind of crispy and it was missing that super soft center most people crave from a cinnamon roll.   Brownie ($2.50) - The brownie didn't seem baked all the way, it was gooey and not in a good way. It was very oily.   Chocolate Chip Cookie ($2) - At first I thought the cookie appeared over baked, but decided to give it a try anyway. Wow! I was pleasantly surprised with how delicious this cookie was. Plenty of chocolate chips in every bite and it was soft and chew, not over baked at all.   They are opening up a Cinnaholic location on my side of town, so I am up for giving them a try at some point. They currently do not offer any gluten free items.",

As soon as you walk in you can smell the deliciousness being made, they had a great options in their display and the peanut butter banana stood out to me so I ordered it. It didn't take more than a few minutes and my order was ready. The size of the cinnamon roll alone was well worth it, the toppings on mine which were fresh chopped bananas with peanut butter just mixed so well that it melted in my mouth. I have found my spot for light and tasty sweets",

I happened to get an email from Yelp about this 'hot and new' spot to check out. Sooo...I happened to be in the area and decided to check it out. Was a little nervous about the fact that all the items are Vegan, never has anything Vegan, but thought I'd still give it a shot. Walk in to some pretty sour faces. Two individuals who made it seem like a chore to even say hello or give a proper greeting. Ask a couple of questions about their menu as it's my first time there and I'm trying to decide what to get. Cold and blank wall responses is what I got. Whatever, I decided to just order a regular cinnamon roll with cream cheese frosting, going with the classic to be safe. Did get a scoop of cookie dough to try. Roll was warm, which I was worried about after reading some of the reviews on here. First bite was okay but seconds after, I was hit with the most awful after taste. I couldn't take another bite let alone stand the smell even. Made me nauseous! Cold staff + interesting food (to say the least) = SKIP for me!",

The mini buns weren't as sweet however they weren't as soft as the bigger ones.

The selection is excellent and it was a fun experience, but $21 for 3 average size cinnamon rolls is a bit outrageous to me. The idea of gourmet cinnamon rolls is excellent, but the execution of their ingredients was simply ok. The dough itself is lacking flavor and the toppings were a bit over-sweet (relatively speaking). We had: 1) the \"twix\" which had caramel, peanut butter topping, and Oreo cookie piece 2) cream cheese topping with fresh strawberries 3) pumpkin spice topping with marshmallow  I prefer Pink Box Donuts over this place, but it is nice to have another option.   The store was clean and has some seating. The staff was very friendly and I wish them success.",

I will continue to come back now because of the nice service and amazing \"create your own\" cinnamon roll. Completely amazing.  The strawberries weren't old and gross, and the vanilla cream cheese that I chose was probably the best choice I made. I don't even like the cream cheese texture normally, but this was spectacular. I even scooped up the extra.  Probably the only cinnamon roll worth taking a picture of comes from this place. I've eaten cinnamon rolls all over Vegas because they are my favorite breakfast, and this place has perfected it. I really enjoyed my time there, even if it wasn't long at all. Hopefully one day, they'll offer packs of cinnamon rolls to go.",

I apologized and offered to dumpster dive to retrieve it from the waste bin, to which the nice employee said \"don't worry about it, I'll get it.\" and 2) \"now that dinner is complete, it is time for dessert\" I realized that we do have to feed our weaknesses sometimes in order to realize that we are still human and, hey, deserve to treat ourselves before we kick the bucket.  I cannot even recall what I had since the temperature in Vegas was 113F. But it had mesmerizing caramel shiny drizzle with brown sugar on the whipped cream on the cinnamon that was bigger THAN AN INFANT'S HEAD.  Forget the Vegas show(s)(girls), just go here...but DO NOT eat before coming here or you will spoil your appetite.  The only real things in Vegas are: the money coming out of your wallet, the summer temperatures, the great Mexican food, and this cinnamon bun!",

    "text": "Being completely transparent with you guys- I don't like cinnamon rolls. I can't tell you why other than I just don't really see what the fuss is about. I don't hate them, but I don't love them you know? So on trip to Vegas, a friend of mine said we had to go and who am I to stop someone from doing what they want on vacation? So I sort of begrudgingly came to Cinnaholic's with her and was actually pretty pleased with the experience.  So if you don't know (I didn't prior to this), Cinnaholic was featured on the show, \"Shark Tank\". These cinnamon rolls come in a variety of flavors and toppings. What makes them so unique? They are 100 percent vegan. It's like my two least favorite things had a child and made something pretty delicious. All of their products are dairy & lactose free, egg-free, and free of cholesterol- but full of flavor.  Options, options, options. So many options. Even from size of cinnamon rolls, you have your pick. I got a mini because I was totally afraid I'd hate it. The mini is kind of the size of a cupcake, which was perfect. You can choose frosting flavors like almond, coffee, maple, marshmallow, orange, and chai. And why not top it off with some coconut, apples, pecans, or almonds? Or just get the frosting. Or get it plain. Whatever makes you happy.  The kid behind the counter was super helpful. Very friendly and you can tell loved working there which makes the experience even better.  Now, I gotta say, I don't know if I'm truly reformed and want to eat cinnamon rolls from now on, but if I'm back in Vegas, I might have to get in my rental car and drive over here for a bun or two.",

Since I like more chocolate and caramel on my cinnamon rolls over fruit I prefer the chocolate bomb or the turtle.  Both really good, look sweeter than they are but not not overwhelmingly sweet.  I don't know for others but I know for me, I don't usually wake up early enough to stop anywhere for breakfast, luckily they are open late!

Just entering envelops you in the addicting sweet smell and it's just so satisfying to say the least.  I also saw them on Shark Tank so I was anticipating the day they actually opened this shop.  The cinnamon rolls are huge and with the amount of frosting/toppings that they generously top it with, I can seriously share with another person. I can only eat half and save the rest for later.  I'm a sucker for their cream cheese frosting so I pick that with cookie dough, brownie bites, or blueberries on top.  I recently went to their free cinnamon roll event and the line was long! They ended up running out of cinnamon rolls. Just goes to show how great they are.   This location has plenty of seating and sometimes plays Bob's Burgers. I heard that they opened another location in Centennial and it sounds just as good as this one. I wish them more success in 2018 and I can't wait to come back!",

Not one person greeted us or said hello (And they were not busy, there was no line). No one asked if we had questions or if it was our first time there.  We went to order and literally, the only words that the guy said to us was if our order was for here or to go.  He didn't say hi or anything!  If that was my business that just barely opened, I would be greeting everyone warmly and kindly.  It was like they were pissed we showed up at 3 in the afternoon.  I would definitely go back for the cinnamon rolls but definitely not because anyone was nice or friendly.  Geez!  Desserts are supposed to make people happy!!!  We ordered the lemon frosting with raspberries and pie crust.",

Honestly, the Cinnabon was good, the brownies were amazing, but the frosting(vanilla)? The worst frosting I've had in my life. It was way too sweet and it tasted gross. To be honest the only reason I would go back would be for the brownie. This place was definitely not for me. It was just too sweet for my taste. The frosting was so overpowering that I was sitting there literally wiping off the frosting so I could at least have a few more bites. I'm sure others find it great... P.s. Maybe their other frostings are better.",

I wasn't disappointed in anything. The Cinnabon was cooked perfect not soggy not too hard it was perfect. The banana foster one came with an amaretto frosting and bananas on top and the flavors went amazing together, and I'm a s'mores lover and the other one had chocolate frosting marshmallows and graham crackers. It was not too sweet and everything complimented each other well. I will be back to try the other flavors. I give it a solid 8/10",

    "text": "My coworker brought me one of these one day as a surprise and what a wonderful surprise it was! About $5 for a roll. It's large but that's still an entire meal at a sandwich place and some fast food establishments.   I am not Vegan. I will never be Vegan. I respect people who are Vegan and I am happy there is some more versatility out there for you. I do not understand why it needs to be punctuated that this place is Vegan. Personally, if there was a giant stamp on the door that stated \"Vegan\" I would likely be deterred. I think this is an awesome conversation starter and not a big deal. Try it!  As far as the cinnamon roll is concerned, frosting aside, absolutely perfect and 5 stars in my opinion. I am pretty boring and order the Old School Roll because I like it simple. But I've tried a few of the flavors and tried their cookie dough which is quite tasty.   For the frosting though, I have to agree with a lot of other people on some of the issues. One is that it is very sweet. You can taste that the sugar isn't dissolved and it gives it a grainy texture. The second concern is their fruit frostings. I've personally tried the blueberry and I was very disappointed. I knew something was wrong because it wasn't blue. The frosting was still the same white color. This means they use a flavoring. Why not use real fruit? I don't understand that AT ALL and therefore will not order the fruit frostings. They taste like chemicals and fake flavoring and it ruins the entire experience.   I think if they could create a way to make the frosting less sweet and make them more natural in flavoring, I would give this a five star review for sure. All that said, it is still a great place to try, Vegan or not.",

I feel they should still honor it even though it's from their old rewards system. I didn't sign up for their new rewards program. Why would I do that? Needless to say, I'm in no hurry to go back. I will say their buns are excellent.  Update: I was contacted by Monica not long after my review. She asked for my name and address so she could give me my free bun. I told her I wasn't comfortable giving her my name and address. After that, I didn't hear back from her.

    "text": "Whoa. Here you have it folks; ultimate cheat day food.  I only ordered one bun to share, which was perfect.  There's such a great selection of frosting flavors, that I almost wish they offered a set of 3 mini buns to customize differently.  This option is doable, but might end up pricey.  As for my first and only cinnamon roll, I got the coffee icing with oreos and pie crumble.  Though it looks like the bun is drowning in the frosting (not usually my cup of tea), it is pretty darn good.  It's served to you hot - gosh I'm drooling thinking about it.    Unfortunately, the drink menu isn't as appealing as the frosting and toppings menu.  While this snack is a definite treat, it is a much earned one at its price point.  Also, I feel like the experience needs to be vamped up a bit.  We were greeted when we walked in, but there wasn't much more interaction after that considering there were about 4 employees behind the glass and 2 of us in the entire store.  I'm not sure what I'm looking for but at nearly $7 for a gourmet cinnamon roll, I'd expect a gourmet level experience.  To be honest, I didn't even know this place was vegan until I came over to Yelp to review it!  That should've been something to be proud of, and I wish I knew coming in.",

Except.. the icing tasted like pure butter!! I'm from the south--I like butter, but this was plain gross. I couldn't force myself to eat it. The roll itself was also a bit dry. The second time, I got lemon icing with fresh blueberries on top. This one was a bit better as it thankfully didn't taste like butter, but like last time, the roll was dry. The icing also wasn't impressive either. My sister has made cinnamon rolls from scratch and these unfortunately don't compare :(",

What I didn't know was that it was 100% vegan...what a shock since there was a menu full of different frosting and toppings to customize your cinnamon roll, along with their pre-made selections. Single cinnamon rolls range from $5-6 and have the circumference of a softball, but they have mini rolls that are cheaper. As expected, it is a very indulgent tasting treat, a bit on the sweet side for me but are nonetheless delicious (I got a tiramisu roll); I am certain you can get the frosting amount adjusted per your request. As others have stated in previous reviews, service wasn't spectacular not because I didn't get my food quickly, but because the person behind the register seemed a bit unhappy to be there in general. Other than that, I would love to take some friends of mine who are vegan here so they can enjoy a once in a blue moon treat.",

    "text": "It's a cool concept! You can have yourself a good old fashioned cinnamon roll or dress it up with their choices of frosting and toppings!  The best part is definitely that it is free of dairy and eggs--and they are very careful with nuts. Those with allergies or some type of intolerance to these products have less to worry about. The palm oil is sustainably sourced and the sugar is not filtered with bone char, making these scrumptious rolls vegan.  I have yet to verify if all of their toppings are vegan (for example: graham crackers regularly contain milk or honey, while marshmallows are made from gelatin), as I am aware that their frostings are. I'm not sure why they wouldn't be, seeing as how everything else is, but it's always good to confirm.  Being 100% vegan was not thoroughly advertised in the store. Though, I did see a sticker in the corner of the display case. To avoid holding up the line, I picked a fuss-free topping--walnuts. Unfortunately, those with soy and sensitivity to wheat will have to skip out.  I went on opening day; the process of ordering and picking up was self explanatory. There are plenty of options to choose from, and I have uploaded photos of what my family and I took home that evening. Overall, it's nice to have a dessert spot that accommodates my friends, family and myself. Everyone can choose what they want for themselves! And with it being so close to home, I will definitely be returning and trying out more flavors and combinations! Cinnaholic is truly a treat!",

Any other Cinnaholic locations throughout the valley I order these from with extra frosting they load it up as it should be especially if you're paying for it.

This is a dine in or to go dessert shop with some style and flair. A great amount of space for those waiting to order or collect, as well as seating for those already digging into their treats!  They are obviously most well known for their buns, which is all I have tried and what I can comment on, however I hear they also have cookie dough and cakes available for purchase too!  The menu behind the till is very clear and comprehensive. Either choose a 'classic roll' (plain with vanilla frosting) or a plain roll and then customise it with your choice of frostings and toppings. Want more than 1 frosting and like 8 toppings?! You've come to the right place! Pick a flavour theme or go crazy!  The service is amazing and friendly and rolls come out quickly!  The only reason I drop a star is that the roll I had could have been a little softer. The middle was covered in frosting which helped, but the outside was a little harder. Was delicious nonetheless though!  Will definitely return for a sweet fix soon!",

    "text": "After talking about cinnamon rolls at work, I decided to try Cinnaholic when I got off. I have been wanting to try to place out for a long time after seeing it at open at this location. Service was good. They greeted me when I got in and also explained the menu.   I decided on trying the Old school one, bananas foster, and maple pecan pie. I don't know why I always order too much when I crave sweets, but I definitely won't be able to finish three. They're fairly big cinnamon rolls and like 700+ calories so I'd suggest sharing one.   I tried the Old School one first because I was really craving a Cinnamon Roll. The dough was really fluffy and delightful. The frosting is really sweet, too sweet for my liking. For a normal cinnamon roll, it was okay at best. I love fresh baked breads and the dough they use would make perfect dinner rolls. The roll itself lacked cinnamon. I didn't feel like my cinnamon roll craving was fulfilled but I definitely won't eat anything sweet later.   The banana foster was okay. It smelled delicious but the flavor tasted very artificial. I haven't even tried the maple pie one and I'm not super excited to.   If you have a sweet tooth and like fluffy doughy bread drenched in frosting then this place is for you. For someone who's actually craving a good ol' cinnamon roll, I wouldn't suggest this place because I was disappointed with the lack of cinnamon. And it's like $6-$7 for one cinnamon roll. I think I paid $20+ after a 2 tip for three cinnamon rolls. Definitely wished there was a Cinnabon was close by.",

This business was definitely spacious and had a good amount of seats. I loved that they were playing the office on the TV at least when I visited. I got 2 cookie doughs and 2 cinnamon rolls. The total came out to $20 something, which isn't bad at all. The cinnamon rolls are very filling! I recommend adding pie crumbs to the rolls. The workers were great with assisting us on what to get.   I highly recommend as a nice treat and definitely come with somewhat an appetite. You'd think cinnamon rolls aren't very filling but these rolls prove otherwise.",

However today, I wanted to surprise my husband with something yummy.   Greeting: As soon as I walked into the story, I was greeted by a beautiful women with a warm welcome and a smile. This was my first time here so I had to look over the menu. I didn't have to ask for help becauseI had  yelp to thank, but the employee did offer great suggestions.  Order: My husband loves peanut butter so I ordered him the highly suggested peanut butter cup and I suck with the classic. Our cinnamon bun was soooooo good. I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie that I couldn't eat because I was stuffed.  Menu: The menu is a bit overwhelming because you can customize everything. Whatever you want they have it. They even have a menu of popular cinnamon buns to hell you out like SMORES, Apple Pie etc. They sell brownies, cookies, and even smaller buns.  Cinnaholic is Yum and I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "For the good: really great dessert place for vegans! The dough was really good and really tasty. I got the cinnamon roll with chocolate and oreo toppings. I was surprised that it wasnt overwhelmingly sweet. The dough and filling really balanced the sweetness of the chocolate pretty well. The menu also had a lot of freedom as far as what flavor profile you wanted so that was good.  For the bad: while the dough tasted really good, the roll was a bit stale. At first I thought it was because of the recipe or because it was over baked, but no, the outside of the dough was dry and stale like its been sitting for a full day (I went at around 2pm) while the inside of the roll was fluffy and soft. I wanted the Oreo topping to have the crunchy texture to contrast the soft dough, but the oreo bits were also stale and it just made the whole texture weird. Also, I had the server what she would recommend as the sauce and topping, since there was a lot of choices. All she said was \"up to you, they're all sweet anyways.\" Well, yes, it's a cinnamon roll so it would be sweet but that completely disregarded the question with a bit of snark. That was a bit off putting.  Verdict: it's hard to find good vegan dessert places in town, so I would come back again because of that and hopefully get a better batch of rolls. And I'll look through Yelp reviews for topping recommendations since the server didnt seem to have any.",

I have been going here since they opened and I went here enough for all of them to know my name and what I order. The cinnamon rolls here are better than any other place I've had cinnamon rolls. The toppings are great and I usually get cream cheese frosting and chocolate chips. The cookies and brownies are amazing too. If I ever am on that side of town, I would make sure I stop by their place and get something to eat. The problem I had was it was on the other side of town for me and driving there took some time, but worth it every trip. They have a rewards system and for every ten stars you get, you get a free Old Skool roll. I'm positive that I have gotten over 150 stars and probably spent the money just by cookies and cinnamon buns alone. I took my friends here to try it out and they all enjoyed it! They also have a place for you to charge your phone or laptop while you're there. Now that they opened a location right by my house, the Centennial Hills location, I will have to go to the new one for convenience. Although, I would like to visit this location since they all know me already.",

There is different flavors of icings and toppings to choose from. Since my boyfriend and I have never been there before, we played it save and got a traditional cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll came out in lightning speed. The cinnamon roll was covered in icing and was so buttery. The guy behind the counter gave us their most popular topping to try - chocolate chips. This place has some bomb cinnamon rolls - we will be back.",

They don't advertise being vegan anywhere and nonvegans have no reason to feel threatened here like we sometimes are at other vegan restaurants and bakeries.  They certainly aren't shoving veganism down your throat.  They are also VERY reasonably priced which is not always the case with vegan restaurants or any bakeries. We came late at night so it was pretty quiet and calm.  We were lucky enough to get fresh rolls which was great but did take a while (NO complaints here but the woman who had ordered just after us seemed to be getting a little impatient).  I got the seasonal apple cider frosting with apple slices, pecans, oats, and cinnamon/sugar on top.  It was amazing other than being a little sweet for my taste.  This is the only reason I gave four stars.  Next time, I think I will try one of their smaller rolls (Baby Buns) so it isn't so overwhelming.  As you can see from some of the pictures, their regular sized rolls are HUGE and could probably feed two people. They are in a great neighborhood with a very clean store and store front.  The staff was super friendly and patient when I wasn't sure how to order.  I will definitely be back and am excited to have a go-to in some other cities!",

Funny, our neighbors mentioned this place to my hubby the other day and he actually wanted to try it too. Rare for him since he likes to stick with the same old places. So off we went.  This is an easy ten minute drive from where we live and easy to find. This is another bookmark completed Yay! We walked in and this cute little doorbell chime went off. There are tables to sit at and the decor is simple yet chic. I explained we were newbies and the helpful clerk walked us through the process. You choose your flavor and then add as many toppings as you like. Everything is vegan which is a plus in my book. I chose the Old Skool roll with vanilla frosting and pecans. My hubby chose the caramel frosting. I wanted to stick with the basic roll to first test out how the actual roll tasted. I was very pleased. The roll is super fluffy and light with a very pure taste. The frosting was yummy and I loved the pecans on top! My hubby loved his roll too and the caramel frosting was True in its flavor. They also had some sample rolls out paired with the maple frosting for anyone to try. Wow! So good!   I noticed as part of the logo, there was a bird in flight. My curiosity got the best of me and I had to ask if the bird had a special meaning. I was told that this happens to be the favorite bird of the owner. The bird is a swallow. She wanted to make sure to differentiate her label from the other competition.   Hands down, this is my new favorite place to score some tasty buns. I can't wait to try the other frosting flavors and toppings! I may require rehab if I become a Cinnaholic.....",

It was my first time here and I was overwhelmed by how to order, but they have a display of some of their pre-made cinnamon rolls. There was another lady who had ordered plain rolls. She loves Cinnaholic so much that once she got her rolls, she gave me a bite so I knew how good it was. And it was!   I ordered the Almond Joy and built my own with hazelnut icing, almonds and pecans. Both were delicious and both were eaten in one day! I'm going to have to control myself from going everyday because even though the rolls are vegan, they are filled with sugary goodness. The rolls I ordered came out to a little more than $13 but depending on what you put on yours, it could cost more.   This place is definitely a keeper and my new go to for cinnamon rolls. They've outranked Cinnabon and I don't feel too guilty about eating two in a day. Bring your family here. Bring your friends here. Bring your first date, your dog, a stranger, EVERYONE! You can't go wrong with Cinnaholic!!",

As I walked inside, I could smell the aroma of the bubbling cinnamon, yeast, sugar, and butter. I just about lost my mind, everything looked exquisite, with an extensive topping combination list. My advice before you walk-in just know what your craving whether it's chocolate, fruity, nutty, or salty-sweet then work way up from there.  The rolls are 100% vegan, dairy & lactose free made with high quality ingredients. I was shocked from the flavor coming out of rolls. I eat everything, I don't have any restrictions flavor is my driving force, however I will recommend this place to my Vegan friends.  The service is awesome, Aliscia & Marco are one of the nicest people I've come across, I believe they have as much fun making the rolls, as we do eating them.   Wahoo!! I'm excited this place rocks.",

Vegas location is great!!!!!! It's super cheery inside and setup a tiny bit different and great.  Walk in, order straight in front of you, and move down the line to pick it up. They have a flat screen on the back wall playing cute music videos that were upbeat. Loves.   You pick your bun, like mini buns or original then pick your frosting (alllllll kinds of flavors) and then pick your toppings! Not sure on prices. (Two dressed huge buns and a huge brownie came to $16.)  My fav is the Smores and the homemade brownies. Or a flavor icing and brownies on top. I was SUPER tempted to get the spiced icing with the fresh peach........but I'll have to try that next time.  When I want cheat time I want cookie dough, brownies, and allllllll the chocolate possible lol.  Anyway I suggest cake batter icing with cookie dough and my usual of chocolate icing with brownie pieces.  They hold up for a ride home, even on a hot day today the eco boxes and paper sack protected them until we got home.  I think they have bottle water and coffee but that's not important.  !!!!!!!!!!!!Just give me some buns hun!!!!!!!!!!",

Came into the Cinnaholic not knowing you can customize your roll to your liking and interesting to know that the rolls are vegan! There are a lot of toppings and frosting flavors to create your own concoction=) I got the old skool roll topped with blueberries and I loved it! The dough was super soft, fluffy, and warm. It tasted fresh and the frosting wasn't too sweet. My son got the baby bun and he loved that, perfect for kids!   Service was fast and the employees greeted us when we walked in.   Will definitely come back for more!",

    "text": "Cinnaholic is a Cinnamon Bun done RIGHT.   I tried a Captain America and a cookie flavored, and they were both great. Soft, gooey, delicious, and most of all photogenic! Next time I think I will just try their original though. It's like when I go to boba, if it is a new place I always judge them based on their plain milk tea with boba. Do the original justice and then I'll know you are legit!! Along this line, if I had one suggestion for them I wish they had more funky combo suggestions. Although a plain cinnamon bun is good enough for this classy lady, both members of my party griped about the lack of options. \"Make-Your-Own\" is fun but the business itself knows the best possible combos. Instead of only offering a few, have a menu of twenty combos and mark your best selling. This would be a huge help to first-timers!  Moving away from the food, I did not like the smell of this shop. It was like a mixture of soap and raw dough. I might have been hyper-aware of it because I was so looking forward to cinnamon and icing smell goodness. Who knows, maybe it was a bad day or they just completed a clean up, but it was actually bad enough to give me a slight headache. I couldn't eat there, so I took my gourmet bun home. The girls working the day I went did not want to be there. They seemed angry and distant. They struggled to put on a happy face but made an effort to be cordial which was appreciated.   Will come back for the bun, hope for employees in a better mood, and cross my fingers for delicious fresh baking smells. Overall a good experience.",

But, as a first impression, we didn't get greeted at all walking in, and the lady who took our order was rude!   We didn't really know what to order or how to navigate the menu, so I told her it was our first time. She then told us to just take the steps listed and then order from there. She didn't guide us on it or give any suggestions.  Not a smile or a lick of care was given.   We still ordered something regardless of whatever happened to her attitude. I was too excited for dessert!!!  It all tasted great!  & I LOVE that's it's VEGAN!   If I had to bash them on something food related it'd be that the icing is many a bit much? Too sweet if you ate it with all that comes on top. Especially once it melts down, you realize how much just goes to waste.   But I also noticed that in this place it doesn't say ANYWHERE that it is Vegan? Maybe it might scare away non-Vegans.   But regardless, I'd go back again  (for the cinnamons buns, not the service). Just probably not on Sundays after 2",

If you can't decide, choose from one of their preconceived flavor combos. I opted for the chocolate chip cheesecake. While I think it's great that they use ingredients that are completely devoid of animal products, I can't say I was a big fan of the roll I tried. It clearly has a different taste than non-vegan rolls, but did have a similar chewy texture. And, they get points for not skimping on the toppings. It was a massive portion overflowing with chocolate chips, graham cracker bits and strawberry sauce I added to it. You'll probably want to share.",

I got a plain ol cinnamon roll w cream cheese frosting to try them out and will never return; no real cinnamon taste and the frosting didn't even taste like cream cheese.

Best dessert ever, I found out it's not that high in calories, dairy free, and vegan free. I'm definitely coming back very soon!",

Didn't think the frosting tasted like butter pecan or did the cinnamon roll taste like a cinnamon roll. The frosting actually had a overpowering flavor that taste of chemicals. Didn't watch  the shark tank episode when this company appeared on, so I didn't know it was all vegan til I looked it up. I'm not vegan so I'll stick with the eggs and milk they put in at Cinnabon",

We were greeted upon arrival with a friendly hello and an explanation of how everything worked.  Basically, you pick your flavored icing and topping for your cinnamon roll off a board they have on the wall. I went with the amaretto icing and raspberries as a topping. The gentleman making the rolls asked if we wanted to wait for fresh rolls, which we did! (6 minutes).  The rolls were warm and delicious. The amaretto icing was wonderful with the raspberries. I was incredibly satisfied. So much so that I brought in more family the next morning to try it out!  The staff is polite and the rolls are delicious. Keep in mind each roll is $5-$6. You can also buy cinnamon roll cakes! Fun place. Will be back!",

I got one with half macadamia/ half tiramisu.  No toppings.  This was not so good.  Had a distinct taste of alcohol (similar to the taste if vanilla extracts) I took a bite of each side and tossed the rest.    The rolls themselves were ok...nothing special. For some reason I expected them to be warm...(just the  frosting was warm, not the roll). The roll wasnt hard but it wasnt super soft either (i personally like super soft and fluffy rolls)  All in all, not worth the 30 min drive and $12 price tag.  If I was in the area and desperately craving a cinna roll I might stop by and try the plain cream cheese frosting with strawberries.    i Should've kept it simple. Oh well, live and learn.",

I came in around 7 pm; there were a few people inside. It's not ridiculously cold in there like you assume it would be. There's a display with some options you can choose from but in speaking with the cashier, there are also other options. Since the idea of putting together my own frosting with toppings was a bit overwhelming I asked for some of the cashiers favorites. She mentioned tiramisu and the decision was immediately made. It's not your standard Cinnabon by any means, I could taste the coconut in the frosting. It was very tasty and worth every bite. I'll be back.",

The dough is great for my Diabetic situation even if the sugar was not. The bun practically melted in our mouths. What can I say it was simple yummy.

Ambiance- The first thing you'll notice as you walk in is the amazing smell of cinnamon that reminds you of baking at home. It definitely was a huge change of setting, and brought me into the world of Cinnaholic  Food- I was feeling adventurous that day, and I decided to try the Vanilla Frosting with chocolate chips and edible cookie dough. WOW. I was not expecting it to be the size it was. Great portions, AMAZING Edible Cookie Dough, and a fabulous treat. I will say that I gave it 4 stars because the dessert was very rich, and I think I'll return to this place on special occasions, and with my family. I am a regular, but don't always go full out.

    "text": "I've never been the biggest fan of cinnamon rolls. They've always just seemed to be a bit overrated and as much as I like sugar/frosting it always just seemed a bit much. All that changed when I discovered Cinnaholic after a coworker brought some in and opened up my eyes.  I'll be honest with you, it's sweet. Very sweet if I'm being honest , but it's well glazed and not overly cinnamon-y. I also appreciate the fact that they have all sorts of flavors and you can customize them so it almost feels like you're at a customer bakery and not just for cinnamon rolls. I will say I also didn't believe they were vegan, which is mind blowing. I'm not personally Vegan, but I have enough Vegan friends that it's great to have another option.  The only downside is that it is across from LVAC, so it is flavored with the additional guilt of a wasted gym membership, which is probably why it's so well loved.",

You can create your very own cinnamon roll by adding your choice of frosting and toppings. They have  fruit, jam, cookie crumbles, and just about anything decadent you can imagine to put on your bun. Plus, it's all vegan so you can feel good about eating it. I love checking out their cinnamon bun of the day. They are also huge so plan on sharing or get two & share both with s friend. Check out their Instagram for different buns daily. I wish they had locations everywhere!",

After my first taste of their cinnamon rolls...I completely forgot that they were vegan. Simply AMAZING.

The lady working behind the counter was super helpful and quick.  We were the only people when we came in but within the 30 minutes or so we were there at least another 8 customers had come in.  For me there was just a lot of icing, might ask for a little lighter next time but I don't have a huge sweet tooth.  I got a mocha one, my dad made his own, and my daughter got the Cookie Monster.  Definitely recommend when you have the desire for a cinnamon roll.  Think they would benefit highly from having coffee or barista area as well!",

I was already familiar with this business from Shark Tank and I was waiting for the day I could finally sink my teeth into the amazing looking, vegan cinnamon rolls and my prayers have been answered. They opened up this location and I'm already hearing all the buzz about it. Currently  having my 1st roll and WOW is all I can say.  Being a new vegan, these rolls have made me a happy girl. I love cinnamon rolls and can consider myself a master in their taste and these are incredible. They offer various toppings but I'm a basic cinnamon rolls with icing type of gal so I stuck with my usual. Their display of rolls looks delicious, esp the Captain America with peanut butter, strawberries, blueberries and strawberry sauce.  Check out this place and if your gf is a vegan, surprise her with one and she'll love u even more",

I tried to find a frosting and toppings that weren't super sweet but of course it was. But a good thing. The portion size was a good size. I wasn't able to finish it and dessert & pastries are something that I always finish. Even sometimes before my main meal. Lol. I chose cream cheese frosting with almonds, bananas, and raspberry jam. I think I should of tried it with banana frosting & walnuts. That's my next pick. They also have almond milk to wash the cinnamon buns down. Thank goodness cuz dairy hates me.",

I personally like the original cinnamon roll without any toppings. My favorite thing here is the vegan cookie dough. It is made without eggs so you're able to eat it without the risk of getting salmonella poisoning! You're also able to get the cookie dough as a topping on the cinnamon roll or you can get a container to go! The container of cookie dough doesn't last longer than a day in my household. People who are scared of vegan food will not be scared of this place. Everything tastes amazing and you would never know it is vegan.  The service is great. Love everything about this place and definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for a sweet snack.",

However, one of the toppings I was really looking forward to, and the main reason why I ordered the Elvis 2.0 and didn't just do \"build your own\", was the peanut butter cups, which this was missing. The roll was $7.00 since it had 3 toppings and I only received the pretzels and bananas. That was a bit of a disappointment and reason for my 3 star. Other than the missing topping, I probably would have given this a 4 star due to the food quality and fast order preparation for delivery.",

Cinnaholic specializes in customizable cinnamon rolls- your choice of flavored icing and various toppings, on a huge classic roll or their miniature \"baby buns\". They also have cakes, brownies, and cookies (and raw dough), as well as fresh coffee available.  For my first visit, I went for a PBJ vibe with peanut butter frosting, fresh sliced strawberries, and chopped almonds- it was bomb. Staff aren't stingy with the toppings, either! I was a little surprised at the total cost, which was just shy of $7 but the portion was enough for two. Roll itself is large, gooey and the consistency was spot on.   Each visit, staff are friendly and quick despite the line. I do wish they opened earlier- I suppose you can eat a cinnamon roll any time you like but they're more of a breakfast food and the 10AM opening is only feasible for most on weekends. At least they're located right by my gym!",

I also tried a bite of my friend's roll with a different flavor icing and I didn't care for it either.   The texture of the roll itself was fine and I would be interested in trying other flavors to see if I found them more appetizing, minus the icing.",

Food:  There are so many options on the display and you can customize It however you would like  Notes: There is no way that one person can finish a cinnamon roll, I would say 2-3 people are able to share one. It is very sweet so if you don't have a sweet tooth, you wouldn't like this plce",

Marco and the rest of staff are very friendly and offer suggestions on what to get if you are undecided. From their Old Skool rolls to Banana Foster rolls to any custom roll you make, you can't go wrong.   Service is generally really quick, but if it gets busy it can take awhile to make all those cinnamon rolls. Went on their one year anniversary celebration day and it was packed.

We were greeted promptly. the lady at the counter explained how to read the menu... (The menu is insane and I can't wait to go back and try everything). They have extensive frosting flavors... (Macadamia nut, coconut, lemon, gingerbread, chai, cream cheese... You get where I'm going with this)... And extensive toppings... (Oreos, raspberries, jam, strawberries, nuts, graham crackers, cookie dough.... Etc etc etc)... Pick the frosting and toppings and warm it up and you literally have perfection on a plate... Did I mention everything here is vegan?!? Yesssss!!! Everything!!!   We ordered the cream cheese cookie dough and the lemon with raspberry jam... Both were amazing... The lemon was superb! I had two bites of each and let my cousin take them home with her ( I would of finished them both that night). They offer coffee and have a cooler full of different drinks. They sell their 8oz cookie dough for only 5$!! And they have vegan chocolate chip cookies!!   I will definitely be returning to this wonderful gem... And when I do... Expect more photos and an updated review!",

Now I can get amazing vegan buns in just 4 hours from my current location! I drove up this weekend and made this my very first stop upon entering the city.   It's a bit hidden within a large strip mall development, but it was fairly easy to find.   They had about 27 base flavors and nearly 20 toppings for you to mix and match.  If you're not in a create-your-own mood, you can choose one of the specials showcased in their display case.  You can also get a plain cinnamon bun, if you're into that sort of thing.   Chocolate chip cookies, brownies, and cookie dough were also available for purchase.  I got a Cotton Candy bun and a Butter Pecan bun, and my DD got a strawberry one.  They came out warm, soft, and tasty.  These buttery buns rival and beat all other; yes, even the non-vegan ones!  Cinnaholic proves that deliciousness can be cruelty-free! I am very happy to have them so much closer to me, and cheers to continuous expansion!",

Nobody wants to make eye contact in a place like this. You're a grown adult eating a giant cinnamon roll. You've already made a weird choice that night to end up here. They are pricey but worth it. We got two for the night and then two more for the morning. We got the originals because there's a special place in Hell for people who put toppings on cinnamon rolls. The flavors are on point! I didn't eat all the icing but if you love icing, they oooozzzeee it on. It would have been perfect with coffee but when you're a shamed night cinnamon roll person, you don't get coffee.

So my husband started to look online and he found this place. I ordered an Old Skool roll and he got an Old Skool roll with strawberries. Needles to say, I ended up eating both of them LOL (mind you, I'm 35 weeks pregnant) I had a doctor's appointment today and on my way back, I had to stop by again.

Next time I'll probably get a baby bun because the regular size was almost too big to eat without falling into a sugar coma-not that that's a terrible thing. ;) There are SO many options and combos that it makes it difficult to settle on one, but that's why you gotta make plans to come again.  Customer service was awesome and the music playing inside was great!   We are thinking about getting one of the \"cakes\" for a family member or two for their birthdays later this year! Will be back when we are on that side of town again!",

It's vegan!  My personal fave is cake batter frosting with cookie dough topping. Their cookie dough is made there (and vegan as well) and absolutely to die for.",

I was actually surprised that the bun I ordered wasn't overwhelming sweet. So it was very delicious! All their buns are also Vegan, so everyone can come here. :D",

    "text": "Ah.. the pains of a small business. They were pretty busy Friday morning when I went in. Only had two associates working. And about 8 customers lol. The cashier was new and actually doing a great job, she just needed help. I kept it basic and got one roll with cookie dough and another with cream cheese so it was quicker than others. I took mine to go, but another customer who was dining in had to go to the back and stop the chef from working to ask for eating utensils... and napkins.   I ate mine on the way. Very tasty and glad they're fresh baked. The combinations of tastes and flavors you can do are amazing, but I feel like the best part of any cinnamon roll is the middle. So save the best for last right? No. Double no. The middle has like 3 tablespoons of hard sugar and cinnamon. Seriously. I had to spit it out. I shoulda remembered to take a picture but I was on the road. And these aren't cheap! I expected more from them. I personally liked Salted Malted's Cinnamon Rolls better.",

    "text": "Heard of Cinnaholic from someone's Twitter and checked to see if there was one in Vegas and happy to say there is! Came with my friends and immediately fell in love with the cinnamon smell! We went in around 815/830 PM and it wasn't too busy but there were a couple of people before us. The wait wasn't long though, and the cinnamon buns were ready within a couple of minutes. We tried several flavors and each one was sweet perfection! You can choose your own frosting for $0.25 and toppings for $0.45. Each bun before toppings/frosting are $4.75. The cinnamon buns were nice and warm and all of them were delicious! Definitely a new favorite place.",

    "text": "BAD EXPERIENCE. If I could give negative stars I would've! I ordered 2 dozens of the cinnamon bites for my friend's birthday. I called around 9:10am and they guy that answered was acting really annoyed with my questions. I certainly felt unwelcome and that I was inconveniencing him. I guess it's cause I called 10 minutes after they opened but that shouldn't be an excuse. I let that pass trying to make excuses for this person. I still went on with my order. After about 30 minutes, we came in and picked up the 2 dozens we ordered and I was so surprised on how shitty it looked like. The buns were sideways, the icing looked like it was just slabbed everywhere, the box was gross and dusty!!! I  was so embarrassed to give it to my friend who is celebrating his birthday. I am so disappointed with this place. I cannot believe how rudely I was treated and then I get a shitty product. There was no way to get a receipt other than give your email to them. So we gave our email (cause there was no other option) but still did not get a receipt. Total bs. Service sucks!",

They offer many options for topping your roll if you want something really sinful.  Coffee was fresh and excellent. Cups and dishes are biodegradable which I appreciate. Nice place to take your plant based friends. I will go back",

I was expecting to have only one vegan option, but to my surprise, the entire place is vegan!!!! I got a fresh one right out of the oven and went with the bananas foster route. Delicious!!!! I bought two vegan brownies to go as well as they look so good and are very soft. I will definitely be back to this place.",
