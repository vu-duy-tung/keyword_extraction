    "text": "Rex believes in loyalty, Rex believes in honor. Rex believes in good service, and servicing good when his neck isn't cramped. Rex has been in Vegas a bunch recently (it's dumpster diving season and Sexy Rexy has a new wet suit. well, not wet suit but a suit that was found wet behind Mike Tyson's house.)  Anyway, to be loyal Rex went to Carson's. First time it was very crowded. The greeter wasn't nice, but Rex understands. Trying times can make the weak go dumb. The second time 4 of us were seated. Slightly crowded but not too bad. They had seated two people in a bad location so it forced us to sit all on one side of a table. If they had sat the 2 people correctly or asked them to slide down we could have sat on the L and been able to talk. Less than ideal but we could handle it. Instead she made NO attempt to help us, and the 4 of us were like bums on a stoop. We couldn't talk to each other. It was embarrassing. They were more worried about the \"owner's table\".  Well, hey owner...we are paying customers, returning customers, and we go there regularly. About 24-30 times a year between both couples. That's pretty good if you ask Rex. Instead you were treated like a human being and you weren't even there. We were just shoved into a table and had menus thrown at us while they ran around waiting for you. How about teaching your staff to take care of the regulars? How about making some sort of effort?    The real problem is that this isn't the upstart spot that needed locals to come down, they are always busy and now they don't care. It was very clear. Rex is never going back. Rex's friends aren't going back. Rex is going to stop telling people he knows about the place. Rex is going to go somewhere 150 bucks for dinner and drinks for 2 people multiple times a month gets you treated with a little respect.",

    "text": "Tucked away in a little corner downtown on 6th and Carson (hence the name), chef Simon Kerry and his team offer unique twists on American classics.   There's only a few tables and bar-top seating. It was only my wife and I, so they sat us at the bar...right in front of the kitchen. Very cool. We chatted it up with the chef and enjoyed the casual, friendly atmosphere.  Now onto the food:  Bacon Jam with Brie: I liked this dish, but didn't love it. It had a \"baked beans\" flavor to it and it was just hard to get over how cloyingly sweet it was. But as sweet as it was, it wasn't very...well...jammy. I expected to be able to spread it on the toast points it came with, but it wasn't really like that. It also had one tiny strip of Brie down the middle. It could've used a little more.  Veal meatballs: decadent, rich and spicy. This is stick-to-your-ribs food done well. The foie gras sauce was velvety and luxurious and the dish was seasoned perfectly. It just wasn't very balanced. Rich on top of rich on top of rich. It came garnished with English peas, so it'd been nice if they'd topped it off with a pea shoot salad with a sharp vinaigrette for some freshness.   Gyro tacos: exactly like it sounds. But instead of slices of an emulsified slow roasted meat loaf, they used ground lamb. All the flavors were there. This was a solid dish and easily the lightest of the offerings we were served.  Crispy chicken skins with smoked honey: it may sound heavy and greasy, but if you come to this place, you can't leave without trying them. They are light and crisp, succulent and savory. Like the best part about fried chicken without the grease and the stomach ache. Easily the best thing we ordered.  Deviled eggs: you put caviar and pancetta on anything and I'll eat it. These were no exception. Simple. Elegant. Phenomenal.  Wild mushroom pizza: nothing out of the ordinary. The crust was nice and crispy and the mushrooms themselves had a hint if thyme which works so well. The bleu cheese felt a little overpowering.  Bread pudding: made from day old donuts from the shop next door, you'd think this would have been over the top sweet and rich. But it wasn't. Very light and airy. It had an almost savory quality to it probably due to the yeastyness of the donuts. Enjoyable.  I'd like to come back here during the cold months. The food was great overall, but a bit rich and slightly unbalanced. A solid effort.",

    "text": "I was in down town so I decided to try Carson kitchen, the new place in the area and based on the great reviews from yelp I decided to try the chicken fried skins but they were out at that time so I eded up getting the Wellington empanadas, the gyro tacos, and the veal meat balls.  It was about 110 degrees that day so the first thing I ordered as soon as I walked in was a diet coke, when I got a 8oz bottle for 4.00 I knew that wasn't going to work for me so I ordered beer instead. The bartender recommended me 1664 blanc a wheat beer with a hint of citrus and fruit which was very tasty and refreshing. The beef Wellington empanadas were my favorite of the items I tried, but at 10 dollars per order it seemed a little to much for them two tiny little pockets until I took a bite and realized that they're worth every penny. The gyro tacos were also good and the name says it all, tacos that taste like gyros, nothing new, nothing extraordinary but good. The meat balls were the the least impressive of the items I ordered, the name itself veal meatballs with sherry foie gras was too promising but there was nothing memorable about them except that they were a little too dry for my taste, the green peas don't help either, I think their sole purpose is to make the meatballs look huge.  Ambience is great. The place is very small and you'll definitely be sharing some personal space with strangers, there's also an outdoor patio and a roof top bar that should be a great place to hang with friends when the weather cooperates but for now unless you want to match your fried chicken skins, the inside area is the only place to be.  I will definitely be back for more.",

Big thanks to all the Yelp reviewers who steered me right. Bacon jam and the oxtail risotto were great.   The main thing to know about this place is the food is family style. The concept is you order the sides like oxtail risotto, mac n cheese, or the sprouts and suds hash and share with the table. Then you order your protein individually, but you could really share that too.   Good food, I definitely enjoyed the experience and will go back!",

They had a nice selection of craft beer and I had a bottle of little sumpin sumpin.   I had the short rib sliders with root beer glaze. I thought they were great. The meat was juicy and flavorful. The tater tots that they came with were good.   My wife had the broccoli dish. It was fresh and very balanced combination of sweet and flavorful. It tasted healthy and totally hit the spot.

To be fair, they're fine, but I wanted something a little different and more personal for the chef creating the food.   So to Carson Kitchen I went, and I wasn't disappointed. Parallel parking out front and immediately seated at about 6p at the bar. Because it was only me, I ordered gyro tacos and seared scallops with mango habanero salsa. These two were powerful and delicate, respectfully. Fresh taco shells/pita and amazing flavor combinations in the tacos. Careful selections of flavors with the scallops as to compliment and not overpower. (Pair the scallops with a Kronenbourg Blonde-they're a perfect marriage.) For dessert I had the glazed doughnut bread pudding. I couldn't fit anything else.   Best was that everything is made from fresh and service was fast and courteous, to say the least. I had plate envy from those around me that I couldn't indulge for lack of stomach space.   I'll definitely be back next time in Vegas.",

Roughly a 10 minute walk from Fremont street, staff were super friendly and although there was a short wait, we enjoyed really good drinks in a comfortable outdoor waiting area. We scored seats on the upstairs outdoor balcony and proceeded to completely overeat. The deviled eggs w/caviar: INCREDIBLE, get them. Bacon jam with Brie: DELICIOUS, get it. Barbecue burnt ends: OMG how could it keep getting better?! Our mistake: the mac and cheese. If you've never had good mac and cheese, go for it. If you have, skip it. It's very rich and frankly doesn't live up to the tremendous hype (but considering all we ordered, we should have opted for something lighter like the cous cous or cauliflower). That said, between the staff, charming location and amazing spread, we couldn't have been happier. Plan on sharing whatever is ordered and go!",

Order the mushroom flatbread that is 12 dollars. It was just ok. It did have a lot of ingredients on it. So at least they weren't skipping out. I felt the crust was too soggy in the middle and when you tried pick it up & eat it it would fall apart. And the crust around the outside was super chewy and just did not taste good. One of my other diners got the scallops and it was three tiny scallops for $17. She was a little bit irritated. If it's only going to be 3 scallops then it should at least be the large sea scallops. There are plenty of other places to eat downtown if that's what the price of the scallops are. Overall I would go back once more since there were a couple of other items on the menu I would like to try.",

My first experience was by chance as I showing some out of town friends around downtown.   Glad we decided to stop in.    The first thing we ordered was the bacon jam and it was amazing! Really smokey and good bacon flavor.  The whole thing reminded me of eating smoked ribs at a good barbecue place.   We then had the Mac and cheese and all the reviews where right. This is a must try.  When then finished up sharing the meatloaf sliders which were great.   The service was also fast and friendly. One of the mangers came over to chat with us and talked about his favorite item.  Next thing we know he stopped by with a plate of the rainbow cauliflower for us to try.   It was really good. Had a good garlic flavor to them and was dressed very simply with oil and I think a bit of lemon.   On my most recent visit they were pretty busy so we grabbed some cocktails and waited in the area outback. The area was very cool with a unique fire pit.  The drinks we ordered we also fantastic.  The I had the brewers fest and really enjoyed it.  It reminded me of a citrus type beer even though there was no beer in it.  I would definitely order it again.  Not to mention the bartender was great in answering all my questions and talking with us.   The only thing I didn't care for in my times there was the deviled eggs.  They were pretty basic in nature and not on par with the other items I had tried.   Next time you are downtown check this place out but expect a wait.  A wait worth it though.",

The location is an easy walk down Carson ace and they are located next to the best donut shop in Vegas (more on that in next review). Their menu is enticing and allows a non-foodie to experience some savory gastronomy.  On this occasion I went with the veal meatballs (in a foie gras sauce) and the gyro tacos.  The meatball was nice and crispy on the outside and tender inside. The sauce should be made into toothpaste so you can savor the flavor!  The gyro tacos had the right amount of sauce and good portion of meat (3 bites) however the flour tortilla shell was grossly empty and too large. (Ingredients in middle - nothing on outside). If I take a bite of just flour tortilla, someone messed up.  Overall good meal and lots of items to try and the service was incredibly friendly however the kitchen is always backed up and lunch should not take an hour to get tacos. The pass seemed to be just waiting on the food at all times.  Regardless I'll be back.",

I highly recommend the bacon jam and also the turkey burger.  Even the beer selection is great.  As for decor, it reminds me of a place you would find in the East Village in Manhattan and has kind of an industrial feel. Very cool.  I think this would be a great spot for a group or a date.",

We had the tahini carrots which were flavorful and delicious, not over cooked.  The tempura green beans were crunchy and hot, a heaping portion.  The desserts looked amazing and popular at other tables but we skipped dessert.  The outside fire pit and upstairs patio were nice but we were seated inside.  Have to mention the chairs were mostly stools and quite uncomfortable.",

I didn't know bacon tasted that good when mixed with jam, just the perfect mix of sweet and salty.  The crispy chicken skin was just heavenly when dipped in honey.  We also ordered pig and fig flatbread which was not quite as life altering as the other two.  It wasn't bad, but after the tasting the appetizers, I was expecting more and this was a tad disappointing.  I can't wait to come back and try the other items on the menu.",

This restaurant/bar has good drinks and small plates for sharing. I have been here about 2-3 times and each time we waited around one hour to be seated (each time was either a Friday or Saturday night). They do not take reservations. They have a nice campfire with lawn seating outside and a bar inside (I don't know if it's open seating) and a bar outside (there are seats but it is not open seating) to grab a drink while you wait. This is a pretty trendy restaurant. Environment is very intimate with very dim lightening. Service is excellent. So I tried the crispy chicken skins my favorite), BBQ burnt ends, bacon jam, baked mac and cheese, and the cocoa espresso NY strip. My whole party enjoyed the food here. Overall, it's a nice restaurant to try, especially for a small party (3-4 people), it's a trendy spot and the food is good, just expect to wait to be seated.",

The bacon jam is one of my favorite things on the planet and is covered with one of my other favorite things on the planet, Brie. The mushroom flatbread was just as good with a nice balance of mild and vinegary mushrooms. Definitely a good choice if you're a foodie or open to interesting menu items.",

Out wait was less than 30 minutes and got seated at the bar, which is my fave! For a Sunday it was buuuuuuusy! My date is kinda small town and found it so funny to see deviled eggs on the menu! Of course we ordered them and he was just laughing! He loved them! Also had the bacon Brie app and the watermelon salad. All were enjoyed by us both!  All in all this place Never disappoints. It is great food and a fun vibe. I'm so happy that CK has shown us their here to stay!",

    "text": "We decided to give Old Town Vegas a shot and check out all the renovations. I found Carson Kitchen on Yelp for dinner. The food sounded promising and it wasn't a too fancy restaurant.  There was plenty of street parking around. The restaurant was a bit hard to find in the dark. A homeless man actually helped us find the door. Not to worry too much, I think the area is relatively safe, just kind of unpopular. The inside of Carson Kitchen would tell you otherwise. It is packed in there and if you arrive during peak times you could be faced with a wait.  We agreed to sit in the bar area which turned out to be a bad idea. Minutes after, another couple arrived and they were seated immediately at a table that just became available. We hadn't even been seated yet. The bar table we were given was extremely uncomfortable and was under a light fixture that had a dead lightbulb. It was so dark that we couldn't read the menu without shining our cell phone lights on it. This shaky beginning was enough to make it just a three star experience but our waiter was so cool and the food turned out pretty good, I'm giving it a four. There is great potential at Carson Kitchen. BTW, we ended up moving over to under a light fixture that was working. Hooray we would be able to see our food and each other's faces. The couple next to us? Not so much.  Depending on how hungry you are, it can work out in your favor. The dishes are meant to be shared and there are entrees that are a bit more substantial. For dinner we ordered the staples and a sandwich.  Crispy Chicken Skins with smoked honey Bacon Jam with baked brie and baguette Veal Meatballs with sherry foie gras cream Wild Boar Sloppy Joe  The crispy chicken skins and bacon jam are what dreams are made of. Forget the fat and cholesterol content. These appetizers were amazing. The veal meatballs and sloppy joe just added bulk. Honestly, I could actually do without those and just pick more snack type foods but it was dinner and we tried to make it a well rounded meal. I'd come back again if I were in the area. I'd just be sure to request a proper table next time.",

I suspect every possible nice thing that could've ever been said about this place has already been said. But I'll give it a shot anyway.  For starters the staff is incredibly friendly. You have to remember that Las Vegas churns a place like this.  People come in with very high expectations, and if the place doesn't deliver they get torn to shreds in the press and on Yelp and are shut down in a matter of months.  Carson kitchen has stood up to this kind of expectation for a while, and they've kept on delivering.  As for my meal, I went with the veal meatballs, Gyro tacos, and the beat salad.  All were every bit as magnificent as others have said they would be.  Keep up the good work Carson kitchen, I sure hope I get to visit you again someday.",

    "text": "Quite a new find in Las Vegas with Carson Kitchen.  It's hidden on Carson Street and the taxi drove right by it as minimal signage.  You will like this place if you enjoy ordering many appetizers as all are made for sharing.  We hit on many of the favorites, gyro tacos, deviled eggs with caviar, fried chicken skins and Mac and cheese with a ting of truffle.  We filled up or the next would have been the bacon jam as everyone said it was the top seller.    Let me start by saying the food can come quite quickly so you should do \"serial ordering\" and order one plate at a time.  We started with the deviled eggs and they just melted in my mouth.  You only get 4 of them and let me say I'm not sure you should share these as I wanted to eat them all.  The next course was the gyro tacos and they were tasty but a bit greasy and heavy following the deviled eggs.  We should have got the bacon jam as the second course.  Next we had to try the fried chicken skins and they were great, almost like eating pork rinds.  Lastly the mac and cheese was some of the best I've ever eaten... now I was full.  We followed with a margarita straight up in a martini glass and it was one of the best I've ever had, and I've had quite a few of them.  The mixologist was great guy and we enjoyed the atmosphere and ambiance of sitting at the bar.  You can easily sit here and eat and drink for a couple of hours; as we did.  This is quite small place and coming in from the bright sun and heat this is a relaxing place to hang out before sundown before going over to Fremont Experience a block away.  This place is now on my must go list when coming to Las Vegas.",

It was well worth the walk in the heat of June. The classic, relaxed atmosphere is just as appealing to the eyes as each dish they serve. There are two areas of tables and two wooden angled bars with seating, one fitted along the bar, and one that wraps around the open kitchen. The staff made us feel right at home too, which made this an easy 5 star dining experience. I honestly wish I could give them more than 5 stars.  We ordered the Mini Lamb Tacos, Macaroni & Cheese, Wild Mushroom Flatbread and the Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich, each of which were devoured with pleasure. The menu is served Tapas Style and each dish is meant to be shared. Wether you're dining with friends/family or alone, you won't be disappointed.",

The atmosphere was annoying to say the least. The food was not as described. On every level this place was not worth going to.  The owner contacted me several times trying to bully me into changing my review. He finally contacted yelp whom removed my review.  My fish was burned. My mother's dish was completely flavorless. The hoops to jump through just to get a table made us all feel unsafe.  Carson Kitchen didn't come anywhere close to a worth it experience",

We started with the crispy chicken skins my first time ever having these and in my opinion every restaurant should offer these they were so yummy and seasoned so well! Next up where the caviar deviled eggs and they were amazing I should have gotten two orders! Lastly was the chicken sandwich and it did not disappoint the only disappointing thing was I shared it with my boyfriend! Never again I need a whole one! It was so good couldn't get a pic before we scarfed it down!!!! We will be going back on the next trip",

The first time I actually went here, I was a bit lost since I'm kind of blind even with my hipster glasses on. It's right next door to O Face Doughnuts. I've also been here for my post-workout birthday lunch and a few other times...all because of a bowl of vegetables!  Chicken: Chicken thigh that's simple but tasty. The skin is crisp but not overcooked. It's quite juicy. I paired this with their broccoli which was a bit spicy 4.5/5  Rainbow Cauliflower: This is my favorite item on the menu. I never thought I'd say that the best dish I've had was a bowl of veggies let alone cauliflower! What crazy friggin ish is that? As a matter of fact, I crave a bowl all the time now. Garlicky, a bit of spice and a bit citrusy. I could eat this all day. A glowing 5/5  Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak: Tender slices of beef with pink on the middle. Earthy and nutty because of the cocoa espresso but without being bitter. 4/5  Swordfish:  Flaky white fish with lemon, mint and basil. Refreshing, light and delicious 5/5  Young Beets: I don't normally get too crazy over beets. The texture is mushy and tastes like dirt - CK was able to make me like beets. 4/5  Gyro Tacos: Greek tacos with tender meat, feta and onions. Nothing complicated here. 4/5  Chicken Skin: Comes with honey to dip the crunchy salty goodness that is chicken skin. Forget your healthy eating habits for a moment and indulge in this basket of magnificence. *crunch crunch crunch crack crack crack* was all I heard when this was brought to our table. 5/5  Tomato Stack: Caprese salad, basically. 4/5  Mac n Cheese: I don't know how they made such a simple comfort food to be better than most places. The crispy top, the creamy cheese sauce...yuuuummm!!! 5/5  Devil's Eggs: Deviled eggs with caviar and pancetta. Absolutely delicious. With the caviar and pancetta, I thought this would be salty but I was wrong. Different textures in my mouth. 4.5/5  They have a few tables by the window, a few stools by the kitchen and by the bar, and a community table. They also have outdoor seating. This is one of my favorite spots in Downtown Las Vegas.",

My husband and I came here for dinner while on a business trip. We called ahead to see if we needed reservations and we were told to just walk-in. So we walk-in and put our names on the waiting list. After 25 mins we were called and told our table was ready. Totally normal wait until we had to wait 40 more minutes as our table was \"being prepped\". We were really excited to try this place and by the time we were seated we were over it. We just wanted a good meal.   Once we were seated our experience was wonderful! The servers were so friendly and my husband LOVED his NY Strip. I got the fish filet sandwich with tots and it had a lot of flavor (and salt).  If you just want dinner, this place is a 3. Great food but poor wait. If you're coming with friends, having some drinks, the wait is no big deal and this place is a total 5.  **UPDATED. Owner genuinely cares about his restaurant and his customers' experiences. He took time to respond to my review and I believe that truly shows the quality of a True establishment.**",

The place itself reminds of the other restaurant downtown, EAT. only because of the small space and the cool decors.  Came here for quick Thursday lunch with the coworkers and this place was pretty loud, busy and packed!  Item chosed was the Black Rice with Oxtail Risotto - very rich, heavy, and tasty! Don't let the small looks fool you.. I was very full half-way through. I also liked how every bite had a good chunk of oxtail meat.

I have a 1 year old son and I had to hold him the whole time while being there and did I mention I'm 7 months pregnant, thank God I had help. The second complaint I have ..I had made a reservation due to having a party of 7 and then needed to add one more to my party. I don't recall the name of the man who answered the phone but I was nice and just asked to add one more to my party. Well he made a smart remark over the phone saying, \"well as long as it's not more than 10 ..\" after I had just said to him, \"I have a reservation for 7 and I just need to add one more.\" Otherwise, the food was delicious, I enjoyed that it was a la cart style so all of us felt like we got to try a little of everything that was ordered, not a lot of food went to waste either. Definitely worth trying but if you have kids, unless they're old enough to sit on tall stools or capable of feeding themselves and I'm talking like 8 and older then it should be fine.",

Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by Michael Martinez and that is the moment our afternoon took a turn for the best.  We were promptly seated upstairs and given an amazing background on the restaurant and all of the must order items. I could tell he was a guy who knew what he was talking about so we handed back the menus and had him bring whatever he recommended we try. It made for an awesome late lunch and is the reason why they deserve a five star.   Best service we received while in town.

It's not that easy to look for a parking.  -location: it's just right next to Donut bar, which is a very famous donut shop in Vegas.  -environment: it's an open kitchen one with some high chairs tables which you might have to share with others. The only thing was not that pleasant was the temperature of the night. It's was freezing cold when outside temperature was so nice. We couldn't enjoy much due to that.  -service: our server was very nice and easy to talk with. She gave us some suggestions on the menu and came to update with us on the food serving.  -meat balls: their meat balls were awesome, the meat was so tender and it's juicy with the top gravy. It's a good amount of portion too. -fried chicken skin dipped with honey. Pretty creative. It's so crunchy that you cannot stop eating.  -black rice risotto with short ribs was so good. The truffle oil enhances they whole dish. We enjoyed it a lot. -taco: it was the pita bread style taco. I like this style more that the other. It's just perfectly made the taco easy to eat. The meat had a lot of flavors.  -wile mushroom pita pizza: I like this a lot. It's the the topping, a lot of different ingredients, they were generous on the cheese and the wild mushroom, the crispy pita bread were matched them perfectly.  -bread pudding was a must: it's so good. Hmmm, we enjoyed it. Bread and pudding were equally put together.  Good food with good service. Hope the AC won't be that strong next time.",

    "text": "I haven't really explored Downtown Las Vegas, but this place seemed like a rock star with the current 4.5 Yelp average and the recent glowing review by the New York Times critic. Even though I don't typically go out for American cuisine, and I haven't actually tried any of Kerry Simon's establishments, I resolved to take advantage of Michael U.'s invitation (and the pleasant company of Clint B.) to give Carson Kitchen a try.  The entrance is actually on Carson, not 6th. It's in the southwest corner of the former Carson Hotel. Parking was readily available, and it's currently $1/hr (max 2 hrs) on the street.  Carson Kitchen itself is one of those places with intentionally exposed pipes and lumber in the ceiling, wooden tables, dark but not muted colors, simple music like Sting or Aerosmith, and a not too loud volume of chatter, at least not during our lunch. Casual attire seemed to be the norm. I liked it since nothing in the atmosphere or decor really distracts you from whatever food (or liquor) you're partaking in.  As is the case whenever you're attacking a menu with Michael, our order was enormous. We were able to split things from the Social Plates section of the menu easily, but we did need a serving spoon or fork for a couple of other items. And now, the blow-by-blow commentary:  Devil's Eggs ($8): surprisingly light take on a classic. Pancetta stood out the most, couldn't taste the caviar too much, and it probably could've benefited from a little salt (to be fair, hard to judge when you only grab one of four bite-size pieces).  Crispy Chicken Skins ($6): couldn't stop eating this. Savory, chip-like crunchy skin with more than enough (smoked, apparently) honey to dip it in. I could have ordered another had our meal not run so deep.  Bacon Jam ($12): almost couldn't stop eating this one either. It's a sweet but still savory concoction with a classic complement in the form of melted brie. Michael is going to ream them for the extra bread that they gave us without asking and without mentioning that it would be any sort of extra charge. In the grand scheme, the $1.50 isn't too bad, but it makes you wonder what other stuff they might try to pull.  Gyro Tacos ($10): the ground marinated lamb is actually a little bit higher quality than what I typically get at a gyro shop, but otherwise it just feels like a tapas-ized take on the classic gyro, with tzatziki, feta, cucumber, and tomato. It's worth a try if you're a lamb and/or gyro fan, but I personally would shy away next time.  Rabbit Ragu ($12); I think this is actually my first time eating rabbit, and Elmer Fudd does now have more of my sympathy. Tasty meat, not gamy. Came with a fairly crunchy (fruit-crunchy, not chips-crunchy) spaghetti squash and grated parmesan. Was a little spicy, but even my wimpy palate tolerated it.  Wellington Empanada ($10): ground beef tenderloin, with something that I had to Google called duxelles (buttery minced mushrooms, onions, herbs). Great crunchy empanada shell, really flavorful filling, good complement of a vinegar sauce of some sort on the plate.  Sprouts & Spuds Hash ($10): probably the 3rd or 4th item I would re-order if I were to come back here. Properly cooked potatoes that have that bit of a crust but are so soft inside, with no trace of that raw potato flavor. Did not mind what I assume are baby brussels sprouts.  Wild Mushroom Flatbread ($10): mushroom was good, caramelized onions were good, mozzarella was good. The cabrales bleu cheese was nice and creamy, and not quite as sharp as other bleu varieties. Unfortunately, I couldn't really taste the cabrales in a whole bite of flatbread and had to rely on eating it separately to enjoy it.  [DESSERTS]  Not Your Father's Twinkies ($8): flavor-wise, this somehow reminds me of the sweet dumpling dessert that I had last week at an Indian place. It does not resemble Twinkies at all, by the way. The mandarin orange coulis brightens the dessert.  I was the only one at the table who liked it though.  Bourbon Fudge Brownie ($8): so heavy, so chocolatey, so yummy. The bourbon isn't too pronounced, and the bacon is something I always welcome in dessert. Eat the brown butter ice cream fast or it will melt on you. The kind of utter indulgence you expect from something called Bourbon Fudge Brownie.  Glazed Donut Bread Pudding ($8): soft bread pudding with very restrained sweetness, lovely caramel and creme anglaise. I like all the desserts, but this one might be the one with the widest appeal since it's relatively safe.  Overall, Carson Kitchen is a somewhat upscale take on American food, with commensurate increase in both quality and price. I wasn't too concerned with the bill since I figured it would be up there with how much we ordered, but a ~$45 w/ tip split was a little surprising. Then again, it's solid value for the sheer volume of menu items that we experienced. Given my usual budget, I'll have to hide for the rest of the week to absorb the hit, but it was worth it.",

    "text": "Expect a long wait on a weekend night. Unfortunately, you gotta stay in the nearby area because they won't call/text you if your table is ready. For an upscale restaurant that's sort-of hipster, I was impressed they didn't have a call system. We tried to make a reservation a week before, but was told a party of 4 didn't qualify. Bummer.  Atmosphere? Some folks are dressed super fancy while others are not. It's definitely a mix.  After waiting an hour and longer, we finally got seated upstairs in the patio. It was a nice area! I loved the decor and the chill atmosphere.   A lot of the entrees and dishes are meant to be shared like tapas, so we ordered a crap load to share. For appetizers, we got the: - Gyro Tacos (YUM!) - Deviled Eggs (Can't ever go wrong with these!) - Fried Chicken Skins (DELICIOUS! It tastes like chicharrones) - Bacon Jam (Skippable, but that's just me! The rest of my table liked it, but I wasn't a fan of it. We ran out of bread and they charged us another $1 for an additional plate of 4 tiny pieces)  As for entrees, we got the the steak and the lamp chops. The steak was delicious and I'd definitely recommend getting it! It was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The lamp chops were good too.  Overall, this place was delicious! I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to find a nice upscale restaurant to dine in at Downtown Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Carson Kitchen has been on my radar from the moment they opened and I was excited to give them a try for my good friend's birthday dinner. We arrived around 5:30, and they were just on the cusp of getting busy, so it was great timing.   The entrance is a little obscure and there are two doors right next to each other, so it's a little difficult to figure out which one is the one you can enter through. We approached and tried the door and when it didn't open we walked around to the other side of the building and then had to walk back and realized there was another door right next to the one I had just tried. When we walked in, the hostess mentioned seeing us miss the door and walk around and I kind of wondered why didn't she didn't come out to let us know instead of just watching us wander around the building. I saw this same thing happen to a number of other customers as well, so they might need a sign or something.   Once seated, our server was very attentive and friendly. We quickly ordered some cocktails and sodas and he let us peruse the menu for a while. There aren't a huge number of menu items to choose from, but almost all of them caught my eye, so we decided to share a number of items amongst the group.   Items selected:  -Cocoa espresso NY strip steak  -Devil's eggs with caviar and crispy pancetta -Crispy chicken skins with a smoked honey dipping sauce -Beef Wellington empanadas -Butter burger spicy tater tots   Everything we tried was great. The strip steak was perfectly cooked and had a nice rich flavor. The deviled eggs were a highlight of the meal. They were rich and a great twist on the typical deviled egg. The chicken skins were very rich and I'd recommend sharing these with a larger group to save you a stomachache. The Beef Wellington empanadas were very tasty, although I did feel a little more sauce would have enhanced the dish quite a bit. The butter burger was very basic, so I probably wouldn't order this dish again.   Service was attentive and their cocktails were solid. I look forward to trying out the rest of their menu soon.",

    "text": "I. Love. This. Place.   It's like a hidden gem. Let me tell you. My friend and I were looking for Carson's Kitchen. Siri was telling us we were there, but we weren't. Just as we were about to turn around, a kind lady pointed us in the right direction. Luckily for her or we would have missed out! We get there and their not open yet! It was past the time plastered online. We waited a little and someone came to open the door.   We walk in and the place isn't that big. Nice, trendy atmosphere. Love the tables as they look like they were recycled and reused. Not sire from what. I guess I could have asked. We sat at the middle section, right next to the lemons and such. Haha! They even have hooks for your bag, so it doesn't have to go on the floor. Which is bad luck! All your money will fly out! Anywho, I ordered the baked mac and cheese and my friend ordered a butter burger that came with tots. They do inform you when you sit down that food comes out as it's done. So one may get theirs before the other. Which happened to us. I got my mac and cheese first. I like to wait to eat until everyone gets their food. I only took one bite. I couldn't resist. It looked so good. The melted cheese, and those toasted breadcrumbs were just screaming my name! Not too long after her food comes out and we dig in. Omg! That mac and cheese is up there with some of the best. Then I had a glob of cheese and I was singing! My friend took a bite of hers and she loved it! I had a tot and they were made to perfection! The right amount of crunch! Not soggy or falling apart.   The ladies working there were awesome! Shout out to Tara and Felicia! They were hilarious and down to earth. Real people. When you get your bill, it's in a book, which you can write a little note in. Of course I wrote something in Lucky number, or chapter, 7.   I asked how long they had been there and I believe she said around 2 years. And I had no idea! I'll be back though!",

We started with the Bacon Jam and Tempura Green Beans both were absolutely delicious. Then we each ordered a variety of sandwiches and entrees that we're equally as good. I had the sea bass which was prepared perfectly with a side of cauliflower. I was in food heaven. We were enjoying cocktails and our dinner then we decided to share a dessert. Our waiter, Manny, had made wonderful suggestions all night long so we took his suggestion once more and ordered the Glazed Donut Bread pudding. We all shared one because we were pretty full but ended up wanting to lick the bowl....as an added treat the manager brought over a seasonal dessert. A Bartlett Pear tart, sweet and refreshing, s perfect ending! Our entire experience was amazing, our waiter was excellent, the service was great and the food was sublime! I can't wait to visit Las Vegas again and come back to Carson's. We loved it!! Thank you for a great evening and a memorable dinner,  Torii Beatty",

I would recommend coming here if you're with a group of friends and are ready to have some food and drinks and shoot the shit.    So, we ordered the chicken skins, deviled eggs, and bacon jam to start off with and all were destroyed in seconds. After that they ordered burgers and I ordered the wild boar Sloppy Joe, which I thought was decent even after having those small plates which were full of flavor.  If we weren't leaving that day we would have ordered more and would be drinking, but since we weren't I felt like we didn't get the full experience of this place.  I'll make sure to comeback and not be as hungover and tired. Based on the food I give it 4 stars.",

This joint is a tad off the beaten path and can be a little difficult to locate via GPS, but hey isn't that half the fun? Not really. If you do happen to find it, it's worth a stop in. Please tell me how the rather delicious looking food is. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!",

Loved the tempura green beans and Mac and Cheese.  We got great service...even though we didn't have a reservation.  I would recommend one...as it appears hugely popular there.  Just a block or two from Fremont Experience...and well worth hunting down.",

Service is awesome, atmosphere is poppin, inclusive, young, fun and inviting.  I highly recommend the fried chicken sandwich. You can also get the turkey burger without the bun (on a crisp bed of lettuce). The cook was very personable and recommended other places to go later. Check it out!",

And that's not necessarily a bad thing, particularly if you like your deviled eggs topped with caviar, and your pressure treated ceiling joists left unpainted. It's a pretty damned cool spot with design influences galore.  The food is what you would expect from young, heavily-tattooed, hipster Food Network chefs: Tater Tots with spice, meat with coffee stuff rubbed all over it, shitloads of bacon. But hey, it tastes good, it's nicely presented, the prices are reasonable, and the environment--in the right company--feels artsy and hip and cool. So put on your Joy Division t-shirt, drop your parents off at the Wynn, pick up your weird cousin and enjoy. The burger alone is worth a visit.  Drinks alert!!! Mixed drinks are strong and interesting. Wine list is uninspired, overpriced, served in water glasses, and meager.",

Great cocktails and service in the bar, and the food was amazing! We ordered the deviled eggs, crispy chicken skin, beet salad, and pork belly to share.  Everything was delicious! We all ordered individual entrees also, and every single person raved about their meal.  I had the meatloaf patty melt and it was great - homemade tots were fantastic too.  Unfortunately when we left last night, my fiancee grabbed both credit card slips and so we inadvertently cheated our server out of a tip! We called the restaurant and there was nothing we could do, so we promise to come back next year and make it up to him!! All in all - Fabulous meal and a really cool place that doesn't feel \"Vegassy\"!",

I went with a group with three other people and it was really convenient that all of their dishes come out family style, meaning that it came in smaller portions and very easy to share. We ordered a lot of food which included Gyro Tacos, Spring Asparagus, Rainbow Cauliflower, Baked Mac & Cheese, Pork Chops, NY Strip, and the Salmon and everything tasted amazing! My personal favorites were the tacos, cauliflower, mac & cheese, and pork chop. For dessert, we had the Bourbon Fudge Brownie and Glazed Donut Bread Pudding and both were some of the best desserts I've had in Vegas. The food is a little pricey but well worth it.  Our server was also very friendly and recommended many of the dishes that we ordered. She came by often to check up on us and refill our drinks.   The atmosphere was very modern and since we came at night, very intimate. A great place to catch up and talk to the people you're with.   I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant for the great food, atmosphere, and service!!",

No worries, we were able to grab drinks at the bar and wait out back in the courtyard. The hostess said she would find us when our table was ready and that she did.   The drinks to start were very good and the drink menu had some unique options. The food menu offers small plates as well as entrees. We opted to order a variety of food items and share. The waiter let us know that food comes out as it is prepared so sharing is really the best way to go.  The Gyro Tacos were very good. We almost asked for a second order of these. The meat was well seasoned and the pita was both soft and crispy perfection. The Devil's Eggs were delicious. The Baked Mac & Cheese was cheesy and had a nice truffle flavor without being overwhelming to the dish. The serving looked like it was on the smaller side, but was oddly filling. The Jerk Turkey Burger was another great item. The jerk flavor was nice and the mango slaw paired nicely with the spice in the seasoning. I enjoyed the tots on the side, but they weren't spicy as described on the menu.  Service was on point. We were greeted as soon as we sat down, waters were refilled, and the waiter took care to explain menu items so there weren't any surprises. The employees worked as a team to get food to the table and empty plates cleared.",

    "text": "Excellent spot in downtown Vegas located parallel and south of Fremont. I recommend getting there early and would not plan to have a large dinner party on a weekend. We arrived about 9pm on a Friday night and it was a 20-minute wait. We headed over to the small bar area. They have a great variety of beers foreign, domestic, craft, as well as a cocktail list. Cocktails range in the $11-$15 range. Bar area is quite small. Cool looking but not a place to meet up with a group of friends. Good place to meet up with a friend for a drink. If you are looking for more than that you would need a table.   Luckily, when it was time for us to be seated we were given a front row seat to all of the entertainment. We were seated at the bar. We went from sitting at the bar to dining at a bar next to the kitchen. At first, I thought it was lame but then got a feel for what was going on. If you are foodie (of course you are because you Yelp) then this is the place to dine. It was like a bonus or getting upgraded concert tickets. It was a different experience to watch all the chefs/cooks/scientists in action.   The food was amazing. There are not too many things on the menu and tapas style or sharing is encouraged. Our server recommended 4 dishes is usually good for 2 people, but I pushed it to 5. I like to push boundaries. I appreciated the menu because you can get a little bit of everything at a reasonable price. The plates started at about $8 and slowly crawled their way up.   We had the gyro tacos which were an excellent choice. Paired that with some rainbow cauliflower (had a little bit of a spicy kick to it), grilled and flavored with garlic and lemon juice. The beet and goat cheese salad was a good selection as well. I tasted the shrimp and antebellum grits that my wife ordered. The shrimp had a really good flavor and was a little spicy.   If you are a huge fan of their food, there is a large swear jar at the bar for you to tip. Just yell out any expletive to share your joy in the excitement of the food. The money is then split between all the cooks and they have a large party to celebrate their success.   Overall, great place to do something different in Vegas if you are a visitor like me. I try to stay away from buffets and commercialized spots on the strip. Come out and support this great small business. I forgot to mention the playlist inside was great. Friendly people and excellent customer service.",

    "text": "Delicious food at not crazy prices. Shared the Sunday chicken sandwich and the short rib grilled cheese with a side of cauliflower. I think the winner overall was the chicken sandwich - fresh and moist white meat fried chicken in a pretty amazing bun with something akin to a secret sauce that was a perfect match. The spicy tots that came with it were also great, maybe the best tots I have had in a LOOOOOONG time. The cauliflower was good, but some pieces were cold in the middle, not really a game changer because at least they weren't mushy but a little, I don't know, weird? Super garlicky for sure, so prepare yourself for that. The short rib grilled cheese was good but I almost feel like I would have rather just hunkered down with the chicken sandwich. I am probably going to have dreams about that sandwich now... mmm... chicken....  Nice spot, my only compliant really is that all the seats at the regular tables are stools without seat backs. We sat at a counter height communal table so we could get seats with backs, which, I guess, for us old fogeys is the way we have to do it. Lumbar support people!!",

The menu is a sharing menu so portions are more than adequate. The place can be a little tricky to find as there is no large, obvious signage outside. They just added a nice patio area outside and on the second floor that can be rented out or used as over flow for busy nights. I can't say enough good things about this place! A must go to...The business will be changing out portions of their menu at the end of month and rolling out new offerings next month.",

We started off with a few social plates the crab cheddar fondue and bacon jam. talk about taste explosions they were decadent and just exquisite. We also tried the mac n cheese which was also very delicious. The last thing I ordered was the chicken thighs. Let's just say I never knew how good thighs could be until this experience. I can't wait to go back and try other items and one thing that was great was our server and possibly the floor manager or owner were there to give us some pointers on what was what and even mixing some of the items we ordered for even more tasteful experiences.

On the way from the Strip, our taxi driver started talking about food and couldn't say enough good things about Carson Kitchen. So glad we took him up on his advice!  We were able to sit at the counter overlooking the kitchen right where the food comes out. Every single dish that came out of the kitchen was beautifully presented. Watching the kitchen and dining room staff at work was like watching a fabulous performance--who needs to go to a Vegas show when you've got this!  All the dishes are made for sharing. We shared Black Rice Risotto and Veal Meatballs. Our server very correctly recommended that since those dishes were both rich that we include something with a little acidity. So they brought us the Pear and Blue cheese Salad which was the perfect addition.  Foodies seek out this restaurant as a destination. We were fortunate enough to be guided there by a last minute suggestion by a well-informed cab driver.",

    "text": "A nice spot to have dinner downtown.  Environment: The restaurant itself is in downtown Las Vegas and is small inside. However, it looks as if they have done some renovations in recent months as they now have a separate bar area which is great if you do not want to have to wait for a table (which they usually have a wait). Additionally, they do have an outdoor patio area in the back which tends to fill up fast as well.  Food: The food here is southern inspired and so far, everything that I have had here has been good. On my most recent visit, I tried the pork chop as well as the gyro tacos. The pork chop was cooked very well, and it was paired with a very nice sauce. Additionally, the fried chicken skins are a great appetizer. The only thing I will say is that the cocktails are below average. They taste too weak and even when I ordered a long island just tasted like lemonade. I typically stick to old-fashioned when ordering drinks here.  Service: Service has always been adequate and I have never felt like I was left waiting for someone to check up on me, and sitting at the bar, the bartender was sure to check up on us and refill our waters when necessary.  Overall, Carson's Kitchen is a nice, fun spot to grab dinner downtown, and while I wouldn't say it's my favorite spot it is somewhere I could see myself coming every couple month.",

Chicken skins as an appetizer was unique served with honey, and my thick chicken sandwich was pretty good. Prices are a little on the expensive side in my opinion. $14 for tatertots and sandwich or hamburger was too high. Same for the appetizer prices for the amount of food received.  Was told dishes are shared, or can be shared but i don't see how as they're standard sized. If i shared a burger or my sandwich I'd still be hungry.

I can say from others reviews that it's a tricky place to get a table. When we arrived ( a party of 5 ) we were lucky to get the last table available! Mind you, this was on a Tuesday at 12 pm. So I can imagine the weekends and nights.   Luckily since we were a bigger group (compared to me and either a food loving friend or my boyfriend) we were able to try a lot of what they serve.   Their appetizer section is like tapas, and everything on the menu is served as it's made (I love that since you know it'll be fresh and hot). So what did we get?  Lamb Gyros - AMAZING. We ended up having them twice. They come with three and the flavor is just perfect.  Burnt Ends - The flavor was great. I ate all the pickles and the dipping sauce was excellent. My only thing was they weren't as crispy as something that's burnt would be.  Bacon Jam - Eh. I couldn't taste bacon and the Brie they give is like a sliver compared to whole dish it comes served in. I wouldn't order this again.  Chicken Skins - The concept is cool, like chicarrones, but chicken. The honey dipping sauce made the dish, but idk if I'd order it again. My dad loved them because he's a fan of pork grinds, so it just depends on if you love fried skin lol Chicken Sandwich - I loved it. It's a great size chicken breast and the sauce is so yummy. It comes with a side of Cajun tots and none of them were left over.  NY Steak and Mac and Cheese - Both were excellent! Definitely worth ordering.  Fig Flatbread - my sister and mom ordered it and they finished it so I guess it's another good dish.",

This place was inconspicuously located a couple of blocks from the Freemont experience in downtown Vegas. This place is hip and they have 2 floors (inside and upstairs patio) so on a Wednesday night, we did not wait to be seated. Our server who was the bartender was super excited and energetic. She was helpful in letting us know her faves and customer favorites popular dishes. The food came out as it was made without regards to the order ( apps, main dish, sides, etc). They make and serve the food super fast! The price is fair per dish.   Bacon jam $13: MUST HAVE on everything. Put it on the baguette, Mac and cheese, meats, drinks, desserts, I said EVERYTHING! So deliciously sweet and salty and rich!  Gyro taco $12: it comes with 3 tacos filled with lamb taco meat. Delish!  Devil's eggs: it came with 4 eggs with caviar and bacon on top. The bacon was such a great addition as it was super crispy with the perfect amount of salt. Another great dish.   Lamb chop: great flavor and tender wrapped in Parmesan crust. It came with 2 chops. Definitely perfect for sharing.   Cocoa espresso NY steak: wow! Marinated and tender to perfection! It's so flavorful that even though I was full to my eyeballs, I still managed to scarf this one down.   Mac N cheese: the best I've ever had. The cheese was creamy and blended well with the Mac. Add the bacon jam to this dish. You won't regret it.   Dessert: lame, we didn't get any. My belly was down to the floor so I had to skip.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "During a recent trip to Las Vegas, we visited this place on recommendation of one of the foodies in our group, and it really delivered! The place isn't much to look at from the outside, but it's warm and comfortable inside. Although they have a nice beverage program, our group of about eight focused primarily on food during this visit. We primarily focused on sharing small plates, so the Social Plates section of the menu was drawn upon heavily. Here's what we had:  Crispy chicken skins - Crispy and delicious, they had a nice flavor and texture without being overly greasy. Accompanying smoked honey was an absolute knockout, and lent a bit of a \"chicken and waffles\" flavor to the dish.   BBQ burnt ends - Tender bits of beef with a nice, slightly spicy and sweet sauce, these were a hit across the board. The side of pickles were a bit too raw (i.e. too close to cucumber) for me, but other diners loved them.   Onion rings - An off menu delight, these substantial rounds of fresh onion were perfectly breaded and fried, nicely seasoned and served simply with ketchup. We ended up knocking off two, maybe three orders of these.   Gyro Tacos - These were presented very close to the classic Mexico City street taco style, and the lamb was mild, making for a very nice fusion dish. Feta was properly crumbly and not overpowering, and tzaziki had a nice cucumber crunch.   Pig in a duvet - Kind of a fancy pig in blanket, this featured an upscale and spicy chorizo on the inside, and a very nice breading wrapped around it. Spicy mustard made a great presentation as well as a good flavor contrast.   Tempura green beans - A perfectly light, crispy tempura over fresh green beans, these were made fantastic with pepper jelly cream cheese, something I wouldn't have thought would have worked, but it did.   Hobo stew - This was like a thick gumbo, and while it had most of the right ingredients, including shrimp and a nice andouille sausage, it fell a little flat in terms of overall flavor and experience.   Rainbow cauliflower - Finished fairly simply with garlic and lemon juice, this dish was tasty, but could have been better with more browning on the florets. The texture was a little mushy for my taste, but flavorwise, it was very nice.   Finally, we decided that something sweet was in order, and since we had a good sized party, we just went with one of each of the three offerings:  Bourbon fudge brownie - Deep, rich chocolate flavor with a definite bourbon note, combined with a tender, almost creamy texture made this one very popular at the table, but the brownie wasn't even the best part. The stunning brown butter bacon ice cream might have been one of the best ice creams I've ever tasted, anywhere. Simply fantastic.   Honey cheesecake - Served with a strawberry liqueur coulis as well as slices of dried strawberry, this was an above average cheesecake with a nice shortbread crust. It was also pretty sizable, so be prepared to share if you get this one.    Glazed donut bread pudding - Saving the best for last, the bread pudding lovers among us (myself included) simply could not get enough of this absolutely amazing dish. The rum caramel sauce and vanilla creme anglaise were delicious but potent, and worked better when applied sparingly, but the pudding itself was soft, just the right amount of sweet, and perfectly warm, with nice browning on the outside and a creamy inside. If you only get one dessert, this is probably the one to get. Well, then there's that ice cream from the other one...  Bottom line: This place was absolutely awesome, and is a very fitting venue to be reviewed for this, my 1,000th review on Yelp. Yes, it's way off the beaten path, but if you love good food, this should be a planned destination if you're in Vegas. Incredibly, even the price was right, with all of the above coming out to only a bit over $30 per person. Just, come here and try it!",

We also got to interact with the staff managing orders at the counter, which was also very interesting.   We ate the deviled eggs and gyro tacos as appetizers, and both were amazing. The eggs had just the right amount of pancetta and caviar, and were full of creamy deliciousness. The tacos were just incredible and the lamb was spiced to perfection. For salads we chose the strawberry and cucumber, and the pear and Gorgonzola. The strawberry and cucumber salad was excellent, but the pear and Gorgonzola was definitely our favorite. We shared both, and both had good portion sizes.   For main courses we chose the chicken thighs and the salmon. The salmon was buttery, and perfectly cooked medium rare. Go with what the chef recommends. I'm not a fan of chicken thighs, but my husband gave me a taste and they were very good. All in all, we tremendously enjoyed our experience. Also, there was a party going on upstairs, and the efficiency with which the staff managed sending the food up was incredible to watch. Locals, book your party here too.",

We arrived and were told there was a wait which was no problem because we were told we could grab a drink upstairs.  We went upstairs and experienced terrible service.  There were open places to sit but we were told we were not allowed to sit because a large party was just sat and no people were able to be served upstairs.  We asked if since the table would not be sat if we could hang out there and were told we must go back downstairs.  We ended up leaving because we were not allowed to get a drink or stay outside.  It would be nice to be treated better as a local who brought friends from out of town.  Might want to work on your customer service.",

The service was nothing special, but it got the job done.  The food really came in to play here.  My friend and I started off with the gyro tacos. My friend, never having gyro before, trusted me with this decision. They were decadent! The lamb was so moist, and just enough of a portion to not fill you up. This actually ended up being my friends favorite dish by far! Definitely out of this world tacos' for a little restaurant.  For the main courses we got one of their burgers and the mac and cheese. Easily some of the best mac and cheese I have ever had. So sad the potion was small, I could have easily eaten maybe 3 of them for how good it tasted.  I'm really picky with my burgers, and it didn't really do it for me. Definitely a good burger, but I would recommend other things on the menu too, I got it medium rare, something I'm not use to.  All in all excellent food, presented well, in a comfortable environment.",

I had the Butter Burger which was aaamazing! Didn't care too much for the cheese though. Tater tots were delicious! Definitely going back to try the NY Strip and Chicken Skins. It says it's located on 6th street, but the entrance is actually on Carson, so a little hidden. Walked back and forth trying to find the place but definitely worth it!",

    "text": "This quaint little restaurant is off the beaten path from old downtown Fremont Street. Finding it isn't hard IF you're looking; it's named for the street it's on. But there's not much around to use for landmarks. It's across the street from an empty lot. And while there's not much around to look at, there is a simple charm to the rooftop dining area on a cool winter night in Las Vegas.  The staff is friendly and identified by the band tee shirts they're required to wear. Our waitress was honest about food selections and steered us away from the root beer glazed short rib. She did make a mistake with regard to our drink order, but we ended up with a free beer, so I cannot complain.  The food is rustic small plate style and meant to be shared. There were three of us so we sampled a few items.  The bacon jam we agreed was by far the star attraction. It's rich and flavorful and even though you feel guilty, you'll have trouble sharing. The Devil's eggs were also quite good, but gone in a flash. As far as the larger items, the butter burger was actually quite good. It comes with tater tots, which were decent, but it's hard to mess up tater tots. The Mac and Cheese was rich and creamy but neither mind blowing or disappointing. The mushroom flatbread was, however disappointing, and so was the risotto. The flatbread uninspired, small, and distinctly missing any rich flavors. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the oxtail risotto was so overpowered with parmesan cheese there wasn't room for any other flavors.   We drank our desert. The beer selection is actually fairly good and non-traditional. I tried two of the mixed drinks and each was well prepared.  A nice touch at the end of the meal is how the check arrives; in a book which invites you to leave an autograph and a message.   Taking all into account, I think I'll try this kitchen again at least once more for the bacon jam. I did take some points away for location as well as for taste. However three stars as a rating comes because, as one of my friends said, \"I think the owner's believe their food is out of the park when some of it needs improvement.\"",

We got the secret Sunday chicken and the short rib grilled cheese with tator tots. The secret Sunday chicken was amazing, flavorful and I would definitely recommend. The short rib grilled cheese was disappointing. Barely any short rib in it at all. A few chunks of meat here and there throughout the sandwich. The service was great and our waitress was awesome.

Unless you're Don Draper, then you just end up on Fremont Street around 4 am after a few too many old fashioneds.   Conclusion: This is going to sound ridiculous...it's the best restaurant in vegas, stay with me. They don't treat you like 'just another drunk', they're not pretentious, their menu changes with the season, food, drinks, outdoor seating, nice people, really nice people.

We started with the tempura green beans which were really good. The pepper jelly-cream cheese reminded me of a familiar childhood taste. Next we had the fried chicken skins which along with the mac n cheese were my favorites. Both were exceptionally flavorful and a must-have when I return. The calamari and mushroom flatbread were both good, but not as big of a standout compared to the other food.   For dessert we got the twinkles and  the bread pudding. The twinkles were not my favorite, but I could see somebody that likes the soggy-cake taste really digging them.

The hostess stated the wait might be up to an hour, but offered for us to get drinks at the bar and sit in the courtyard.  We chose to wait and sit in the courtyard.  I had a sangria and he had a beer.  We sat for maybe 20 minutes before we were seated at the counter.  We were able to watch the inner workings of the kitchen, which was fun.  We ordered tempura green beans, chicken skins, and bacon jam from the social plates section.  We ordered the cocoa-espresso ribeye and rabbit ragu as well.  We had the bourbon brownie dessert.  Everything was fabulous and really quite reasonably priced.  A great dining experience.",

The menu is incredible, the food is inventive, whimsical and of the highest creativity and quality. They make me lust for cauliflower. I don't even like cauliflower, but the way Carson Kitchen does it is unlike anything that I've had from this flower of cauli. Bacon Jam. Fried Chicken skin. Butter Burger. Steelhead Trout. Devils eggs with pancetta and caviar. This is not any bit of hyperbole. This is an actual list of some of the offerings found in this tiny piece of Las Vegas foodie heaven. Want to impress someone, or bring them for their last meal on earth? Bring them to Carson Kitchen. Make reservations. Sit at the pass. World= rocked.",

    "text": "BEST craft cocktails EVER.  Seriously. Lots of people design creative craft cocktails, but then other people make them and they're way off balance. Or something else is wrong. We had six, and all were in the range of stellar to magnificent.  5++++ stars for those amazing cocktails. Great variety too. Some more boozy, some less, great variety of spirits and house-made elixirs.  Great service.  Food? Left a lot to be desired for me but my partner was more easily pleased.  We shared mac n cheese (my personal favorite and one of the better macs around), broccoli crunch, and roasted cauliflower. The cauliflower was a garlic cop-out. Like young people who don't understand flavor and cook only with garlic and salt. Only in this case it's garlic and lemon. Not interesting, not creative. The broccoli crunch had raisins (not on menu list) and lacked pepitas (on menu list). If it's going to flip from what's advertised they should tell you.  Surprise raisins are just not cool. Partner liked both of those dishes, but I'm the chef in the family, and I found them lacking. I think he liked the mac less because of the pasta but I thought the pasta was excellent--smaller elbows that didn't taste like boiled bread like some of the larger pastas can. Had a nice tang.  Overall this place warrants a visit, especially from those who eat meat. The heavy-on-meat menu had a lot of creative options. They really should add a vegetarian sandwich/slider option to the all-meat sandwich list.   My other complaint was being seated by a rear door that apparently leads to a patio (unused because freeeeeezing) and the offices, but employees constantly went out to the \"office\" for apparently no good reason and froze us out every single time they opened the door (about 30 times in 3 hours).",

If I had to choose, I would say that the Bacon Jam and the Donut pudding were the real dinner MVPs.  The rooftop was a great place to unwind from a long day and enjoy cocktails. I don't normally buy cocktails in Vegas, since I'm usually drowning in comped drink tickets. But these cocktails are worth the cash and the stroll off Fremont.",

She had no problem explaining the drinks to us and giving us recommendations. We had a few cocktails , that were great we had a Flatbread the jalapeno poppers and dessert.

The old hotel has some great little nooks and crannies, worthy of becoming a go-to late-night hangout.    From greeting through to bill payment, service was friendly and attentive. Our server (Vicky I think?) offered just the right mix of good cheer without being cloying. The only little hiccup was a lengthy wait for our last dish, maybe ten or so minutes, but we didn't feel neglected and weren't in a rush so no harm done. In general, the atmosphere was festive and inviting. Great energy.   Our dishes were 1. Spuds/Sprouts Hash; 2. Veal Meatballs; 3. Wellington Empanadas; and 4. Chicken Thighs with Chimichurri. The first dish was far and away the least successful of the group, and was actually quite disappointing. In flavor, texture and even color everything was monochromatic. The \"spuds\" weren't fully cooked. The dish was heavy, brown, and muddled. The meatballs came next, and were a revelation. They were tender and moist with a rich, dark outer crust, and the foie/sherry cream sauce was divine; especially the bright notes of sherry, which cuts through and elevates the otherwise heavy combination. Not sure how necessary the 9 stray peas are though. Third came the empanadas, with a gorgeous buttery/flakey crust and moist and tender filling. The accompanying \"gravy\" seemed to be made from a demi-glace, as it was layered with all kinds of delightful \"colors\"; problem was it was face-scrunchingly salty. Rarely is over-salting an issue in restaurants, but this was put-down-your fork salty. Finally came the chicken thighs, which I was overjoyed to see on the menu. Thighs are the best and most tragically ignored part of the bird, and CK knows this and gets it right. Boneless and slightly flattened, they are the perfect combination of moist and juicy meat with cracklingly crunchy skin. Just like God intended. The Chimichurri is a brilliant accompaniment, full of brightness and acidity, but once again it was over-salted. The sauce man needs to take it down a few notches. The chimi wasn't as excessive as the \"gravy\" but it was still distracting. Nevertheless, I loved the thighs. The juicy-crispy combo reminded me of my favorite dish at Raku, \"juicy deep fried chicken\"--so bravo and thanks, CK!   I live down the street and am thrilled to have CK in the neighborhood. I'll be back soon to further explore the menu and enjoy the historic space.",

You'll have to get used to the fact that they don't have many small personal tables and it's more large high tops seating with other guests but it's a fun way to talk to your neighbors and see what everyone else is eating.   We started with a few gin cocktails called The Margarian. Refreshing and slightly sweet, the gin is hard to taste and the cucumber soda helps balance the sweet. Easy to drink!   The menu changes with the seasons so it's nice to know there is always something new to try. I ordered the trout and blood orange and root salad. The trout tasted more like salmon and was so good! The skin was crispy, the fish was moist and it was seasoned well. It came with creamed kale and that was also flavorful and perfectly seasoned. The salad was also great. Different textures and tastes of sweet orange, rooted vegetables, olive oil, and celery leaves. Perfectly balanced and a great pairing for the fish.   We finished our meal with what was recommend by not only our server but everyone else on yelp, the bread pudding! I'm not usually of fan of bread pudding but it's made with donuts, it sounded impossible to dislike. And it was. Holy donut deliciousness! It was so tasty! The caramel sauce it's served with was drinkable. Yum!   Or server Courtney took great care of us. We appreciated her recommendations, friendly personality and continuous good service.   Carson Kitchen is a fun spot and I look forward to going back.",

Carson Kitchen is next door to the what-used-to-be, O face doughnuts . We started off with cocktails then went ahead and ordered the following:  Bacon Jam with Brie &Crostini  Black Rice Oxtail Risotto  Edamame  Glazed Doughnut Bread Pudding   Bacon Jam with Brie- was everything and more. Sweet, fatty, creamy, the Brie cheese complemented the bacon very well. I would come back just for this alone. 5/5  Black Rice Oxtail Risotto- the oxtail wasn't very pronounced in this dish, it was bland. Appealing to the eye but bland . 3/5   Edamame- citrusy, spicy and salty. It was good but not a wow factor for me . 3/5  Glazed doughnut Bread Pudding- when I think back on my experience here, I think of this beautiful and delicious dessert. The bread pudding was made from the glazed doughnuts at O-face. Sweet, creamy, and glazed doughnut deliciousness . 5/5  Can't wait to see what else Carson's has in store for the following years .",

We bartenders was not very knowledgeable about the cocktails, overall the service at the bar was good.  When we received our seats, we had a great view of the kitchen and got to see first hand how well the restaurant was expedited. We we're excited to eat.  The devilled eggs were very good. The chicken skins also good (very large).  There was an issue and we didn't get our steak or cauliflower for about 45 mins+. The steak finally came and was really lacking flavour (leanest striploin I've seen) and was a huge disappointment. The cauliflower was okay, super standard.   Overall, the service was not good.  A server started to clean the glass on the window near the door right by us and sprayed myself and partner with some cleaning product as we ate. The manager did offer us a free dessert, however we were full at this point and they didn't not take anything else off the bill (with two cocktails and two wines).  Better restaurants in Vegas to check out. Would not return.",

Our table had quite a few things that were shared and I loved every bite I took.   Best watermelon salad ever, get it TRUST ME! The fried green beans were delicious too! I got a sample of the fig/pork belly dish and loved it too. Pretty much all the food was phenomenal.  Sneak out to the back patio, what a space and beautiful murals too. We had fun sitting out in the evening.    only downside was that one of the staff didnt know how to take when someone made an observation they didnt like to hear. It's a lil crappy to be told I didnt know what I was talking about when I said my chicken was under cooked on one area close to the non-grilled side. He actually said it very cocky \"we know how to cook chicken\". So do I, but the customer is always right!!! especially, since I have taken multiple cooking classes and food safety and cook chicken to temp all the time. There was a gooey corner with a pink shiny dot, I was sure. You dont have to be a chef to see a textural difference and a different color on the lower 3 slices and not on the others. The lighting was dark, but I could see the inconstancy a mile away and used my phone light to verify, 3 food bloggers at our table, we all checked it before I commented quietly and discreetly to the server. I still give a 5 star because the flavor was through the roof amazing. It was safe to eat, but I wanted them to know, incase it was a missed at the pass. The staff was fun and friendly and I didnt want to lessen my rating based on one guy or let him ruin my night. ****updated restaurant reached out to let me know the staff will be spoken to about this. ***   This restaurant is too good to pass up. If you are visiting swing by when you are by Fremont.",

    "text": "I absolutely adore being introduced to new places that were not previously on my radar, and Carson Kitchen is my latest obsession! I have put off writing this review for far too long... Carson Kitchen is where it's at! And for the last few months, it seems that's where I've been at, because of that fact - I.can't.stop.coming.back!!  If you haven't visited CK you're in for a real treat - in more ways than one! It's a tiny little restaurant on Carson Ave in Downtown LV. It's small and intimate, and that's one of the things I adore about the place; every time I've dropped in the place has been packed! The decor is somewhat industrial/hipster - the main dining area is filled with several small tables, a few counter height, and of course a bar area. When the weather is nice they open up the patio on the roof, which hosts an additional bar, a lot more seating, and some decent views of the area.  There are several options on the menu and everything is served ala carte. I've tried quite a few different things and feel like ALL of them are my favorite, they even just redid their menu this week and have added a couple more items to my ongoing favorites list. A couple MUST TRY items are: The Bacon Jam - it is dangerously addictive and the Mac & Cheese - it is my new guilty pleasure! It's the variety in menu offerings that differ from the norm (like fried chicken skins with honey) that really make my mouth water! I tend to always order just a few of the appetizers or sides and share them, but I always end up leaving satisfied and full. To top it off their prices are very reasonable.  Service here has never been a problem for me, the staff is wonderful and super friendly; my last few visits I've received hugs hello and goodbye from several of them. It seems everyone there enjoys their job, and it's a real family feeling among them!  If you are in the downtown area, or you're looking for a great place to try something delicious and new, you won't be disappointed with Carson Kitchen!  Side note: they'll bring you your check inside an old book - feel free to sign it, add a note, quote or drawing - leave your mark or make a future guest smile!",

    "text": "So, as a Las Vegas local, my friend and i decided to go to Downtown Las Vegas to support local business and to try something new. Per Yelp recommendations and the recognition of the name \"Carson Kitchen\" by previous friend posts on social media we decided to try it out. We walk into the establishment's front door and no one was there to greet us at all. About 3-4 minutes of standing by the door, the male employee with the mustache who, as it seemed, was controlling all the order tickets, turned around and recognized my friend and i and said \"be right with you guys\" and we acknowledged with an \"ok.\" A few minutes later, a couple walks in and stands just off to our right in which a caucasian make employee with a beard, wedding ring, and a pink jelly bracelet on his right wrist acknowledges them right away and recommends that they go to the bar and wait and he'll call them in about 20 minutes or so. Doesn't even look at my friend and i and offer the same accommodations and walks away, the 2 of us still standing by the front door with menus in hand so that we can order as soon as we get sat as the place closes in about 40 minutes. A female employee then approached us and asks if she can put us on the waitlist. Didn't even know there was one. I say ok and mention about how the guy with the beard totally ignored us. She apologized and offered us to wait at the bar... well guess what?! the couple who came in after us and WASNT ignored got the last two seats. Lucky us right? So then the guy with the beard takes over and puts our name on the waitlist. Again offers the bar or the back courtyard to wait. Well, can't do the bar so we walked to the back courtyard where i quickly jumped on Yelp! to find an alternative establishment in which to support local. Found Park on Fremont and the girls at the front were super friendly, accommodating and we were quickly sat and shortly there after, the server was at the table to take drink and food orders and made awesome recommendations.   You only have one time to make a first impression and sadly, Carson Kitchen just didn't understand that. Again, as a Las Vegas local, i get asked by friend, family, and colleagues for recommendations for food and drink locales as i live here. Carson Kitchen wouldn't not be my first, second, third, fourth or even 50th choice just because of the way my friend and i were treated. Again, you have one time to make a first impression, and to say the least, i felt as if my friend and i didn't exist as opposed to the other 2 who walked in after us.   Don't waste your time with this place because i certainly will never revisit this establishment and will voice my opinion to other social media outlets such as TripAdvisor, Eater, and other online sources that recommend restaurants.",

We had the crispy fried chicken skins....yummy.   The veal meatball were delish.   My only complaint is I wish I could taste the Foi Gras, but I still would order them again.   The gyro tacos were tasty but the oxtail risotto stole the show.  Just delicious.   My date ordered a cocktail that was so tasty.    It had tequila and cayenne pepper in it...not sure what else was in it, but who cares.  You had me at tequila and cayenne pepper.  The service was wonderful to spite the fact that they were packed to the gills. Everything arrived promptly, hot and perfectly seasoned.   I'm already looking forward to going back!",

The shrimp were also damn tasty. I think they lost a point on the shepherds 3.14 dish. The gnocchi were soft pillows that melted in your mouth among the shredded pieces of lamb but the sausage had a distinct taste that I didn't care for and the au jus lacked flavor. The edamame was a nice twist of the original but didn't increase the flavor of the dish. Everything else was 5 star worthy!",

    "text": "Went during lunch hour with a friend, I love Simon at the Palms Place. I was hoping for a similar experience. When we walked in it wasn't too busy. I had read the menu online before coming in but unfortunately not only was 50% of the menu different or it had been changed, but they had already ran out of two items an hour into opening. We interacted with 3 out of the staff of probably 12. The hostess looked like she didn't want to be there and that she was annoyed by seating us. The server seemed pissed off when I was asking questions about the menu (about what was pregnancy safe... Which turns out a lot wasn't!) and he also forgot my friend's drink. The man bringing out our food which we assumed was a manager of sorts at first came off like there was a chip on his shoulder as well but then later on he seemed to warm up to us. We ordered the bacon jam, chicken skins, edamame, and the butter burger. The party on the burger was a little small and the edamame was not worth the $8 but everything was pretty good and came out nice and hot. Would definitely want to try it again maybe if the menu changes up again. But not if the staff is still so miserable, unwelcoming and awkward..",

Meant to be a sharing menu with somewhat smaller size portions, but the large meat entrees certainly enough to share.  Sea bass was deliciously grilled, tender, presented with tarragon, Italian parsley, a mint leaf, and a roasted slice of lemon.  A ribeye steak medium well was a bit salty but otherwise tasty and tender.  Side of spaghetti squash with rabbit (yes, hop hop) was tasty, as were colorful golden and red beets.  The margarita with cayenne salt was punchy and delicious.  Fantastic cozy atmosphere with varied seating arrangements, great for a date.  At about 6p on a Sunday didn't have a wait.",

    "text": "My hopes were really high based on Yelp reviews.  We had about a 30 minute wait so got a cocktail upstairs at the bar and took it downstairs to the courtyard.  Very relaxing and comfortable wait.  We (4of us)were seated at the eating bar downstairs.  Good seating since it was facing the kitchen so was fun watching the chefs at work.  The staff was great and our server was attentive.  He recommended eating  tapas style; the four of us sharing plates.  Sitting at the bar made that pretty difficult.  We first ordered burnt ends, fried chicken skin and tempura green beans. Unfortunately none lived up to expectation.  The burnt ends were 90% fried fat.  None of us got much meat to speak of.  I'm from barbecue country and know what burnt ends are.  These weren't it.  The chicken  skin was cooked exactly as I expected but way too salty.   The tempura green beans had no tempura batter on them. Some of the beans had a thin layer of batter on them.  They were also a bit greasy.  It was as if the grease was not hot enough when they were cooked.  That being said, the overall texture of the beans was quite good.  Not too under done, not too over done.  To end the meal, we got watermelon salad, mac and cheese, asparagus salad and cauliflower.  All were good.  The two salads were fantastic.  Be prepared to say \"what did you say\" a lot.  Very noisy.   I think sitting on the deck upstairs to eat would probably have made the dinner more enjoyable.  All in all, it was a fair experience and wouldn't go back, which pains me to say.",

My wife had the osso Bucco I had the black Rice Risotto and both tasted excellent the osso Bucco was soft and was still on the bone. It was cooked perfectly. Black Risotto with oxtail tasted amazing, me and my wife shared both our entree's protein via the osso Bucco and Black Risotto a great combo. My daughter had the taters, hey its taters screwing the taters would definitely be bad for ANY restaurants.   Ambiance: Good vibe, not great for family dining though, it was small, it would be noisy if we didnt go there on Saturday at 2:00 PM. A great place to hang out and dine.  A meeting place for Yuppies of some sort kind of Vibe.  Restroom: Very small, should have been maintained better though.   Location: This place is the definition for Hole in the Wall dining, the location is in downtown las vegas, Downtown las vegas has been revitalized to a degree, but still has some bad neighborhood vibe to it but changed a bit a result from Downtown project by tony Hsieh Zappos Founder. Hopefully with more time and effort downtown las vegas can be compared to DownTown Chicago, or Downtown Frisco as of now I dont see it yet.",

Deviled eggs, better than your grandmas ancient recipe.  Tacos, hell yeah I'll have another... Flat breads are really good, good enough that I high jacked my friends left overs. If you like spicy, the boneless chicken oysters are the bomb. Anyhow, whatever you get, you won't be disappoint. I suggest getting everything family style... More choices to pass around.   Service, bar none!  Enough said.... Just be careful that the bartenders don't see you chair dancing as they will call your ass out for a dance off. I didn't have the heart to show my sweet moves and one up the bartender, but if I had guzzled another Jack and Coke, she would have been in trouble, haha!

Be warned that you are not allowed to park in the street directly across from the entrance!  The interior is set up for table sharing type eating.  The three of us ate on one of the big butcher blocks next to the bar on the left upon entering and shared the table with about 5 others. It looks like they don't offer your own table unless you eat on the deck upstairs or have a big enough group to take up one of the big tables downstairs.   The decor inside is awesome, they did a great job.  It offers that hipster/raw/industrial feel but still feels classy.  The bartender at the upstairs bar was very chill and quick.  He whipped up three of their signature cocktails very quickly.  The server downstairs was very friendly and knowledgable of the food on the menu.  My only con about this place was that the food took FOREVER to come out, roughly 25-30 min, and we didn't order anything fancy.  The food was very good though!  I'll let them make up for it there.  Overall though this place is awesome, the ambiance is there, the service was great, drinks were tasty, and the food was delicious.  Will definitely be back!",

It's a small charming place where everything is ala carte and comes out in multiple stages. Which I was sure of at first, but it works and well!  From the unique drinks at the bar to the excellent food; Carson's is a can't miss in your Vegas trip!  The flat breads, vegetable dish, steaks and the worlds best butter burger will have your taste buds not knowing what just hit them... EXCELLENT!!!  From the ambiance inside, charming patio hidden out back, the delicious food and the great friendly attitudes from everyone... it's a nice break from the Vegas hustle and well worth the drive to the old strip!  I'll definitely be back!!!",

    "text": "Carson Kitchen is indeed,  as good as it gets!  My husband and I were in town for a conference from Chicago (home to some of the best restaurants in the country) and were actually planning to eat at a buffet on the strip the night we ended up at Carson Kitchen.  We were too late to get a table at the buffet (thank goodness) and ended up snagging a couple seats at the kitchen bar of Carson Kitchen - the best place to eat.  We loved watching Chef Harwell and his staff prepare all the tasty dishes and send them out to the dining room.    We ordered the bacon jam, the baked mac and cheese, the wild mushroom flatbread, the rainbow cauliflower and the glazed donut bread pudding.  Oh my word!  My mouth is starting to water just thinking about how good every single thing was, especially that mac and cheese.    We had a lovely chat with Ethan, the director of operations, about Chicago and the restaurant industry and even discovered a shared acquaintance!   He recommended we try the bacon jam on a piece of baguette with the mac and cheese on top...  Absolute HEAVEN!!!  That was the best decision I made the entire time we were in Vegas, hands down!    The food was to die for, Stacey, our server was such a doll and Ethan was a joy to talk with.  Excellent food and even better service (if that's even possible)!    Please do yourself a favor and leave the strip if you are in town visiting - there is so much more to Las Vegas.  Carson Kitchen is proof of this fact!  P.S. The next night, we went back to the buffet (because my husband really likes to eat large quantities of food) and all I could think about was how sad I was we weren't eating at Carson Kitchen again!  : )",

It was extremely loud where we couldn't even talk to each other, the service was ok with long waits in between and to top it all off they added at 1 next to our tip making the tip 62%.  This is theft and very bad business. -----Update the owner contacted me the same day and resolved my issue.  As it turns out it was a mix up with checks and we have all been issued a refund.  Changing my rating to 5 stars due to this quick resolution.  Also as I understand part of the restaurant was closed which explains the increased noise level.  I will definitely visit again as the food was amazing my issue was only around the incorrect charge.  Thanks Cory for resolving our issue.",

Turns out there's a reason why fried chicken skin isn't as popular as fried pork skin: It's just not very good.  Sadly, I also was not impressed by the other items I tried. The deviled eggs were pretty plain (nowhere near as good as those at Yardbird), and the bacon jam was more sweet than savory (nowhere near as good as that at The Bronze Cafe).   Maybe I shouldn't be comparing Carson Kitchen to other restaurants. But that's what people do--especially in a city with scores of great dining options.  I will say that my drink (The Magarian) was pretty tasty. And my husband loved the pork belly (aka \"pork wings\"), although I wasn't a fan. But we both wish the restaurant took reservations for small parties, because we had to wait 40 minutes for a table. Luckily, we scored a two-top, because most of the other seats were at \"community tables\" and I wasn't in the mood for small talk with a stranger.  I guess I don't get the concept, and maybe I ordered the wrong items, but Carson Kitchen just isn't the place for me.",

Located on the eastern side of Fremont Street, this restaurant, this area, is a welcome respite from the very loud Vegas so many of us are used to. Great food selections. As part of the tour we had fried chicken skin w/honey - sounds bizarre, but this was a welcome \"street food\" selection. Think gourmet pork rinds, with chicken. We sampled a savory veal meatball course that was simply delicious - an \"elevated\" meatball. Finally, a beet salad with pistachio crusted goat cheese. For the record, I do not like beets. This course? DELICIOUS. Very kind and attentive wait staff. Just an unexpectedly wonderful experience!",

It is wise to make a reservation but if you don't mind waiting order a refreshing cocktail.   Let's see so I been with a couple groups that didn't mind sharing everything (recommended) and one group where we ordered separately.  I love, love the Brussels sprouts Caesar -recommend to start.  Also the crispy chicken skins - so good and hot and salty and chewy. The bacon jam is also very flavorful and delicious.   I've had the NY strip with cocoa-espresso sauce - sounds interesting but it really does taste amazing. Also thought the meat was cooked perfectly medium rare.   The black rice and oxtail risotto is very good, love the chunks of oxtail. It is pretty salty but highly recommended to share with group. The Baked Mac and cheese is probably one of my favorites at a place, they do it right with the crunchy top but gooey cheese sauce, not chunky/clumpy at all. I don't recall which flatbread we ordered but I remember my friend obsessing over it.   Desserts....all amazing but that glazed donut bread pudding, in my mind, is worth eating here.   Service and ambiance- all great the times I've been.",

Sitting at the bar is cool too because you can watch the kitchen and staff prepare everything. It made me really want to order a flatbread.   We tried the smoked trout appetizer which is good if you like mustard seeds. Young beets was refreshing. We ordered the NY strip but the server forgot to put it in and we had to run before she could correct it. The server was super apologetic and it wasn't a big deal because we were pretty full anyway. The service has always been great and super friendly every time I'm here. I'm def coming back for some flatbread!",

We asked the best and most convenient way to order bar drinks since our meal did not include beverages - he wasn't happy about accommodating - I mean the higher the tab the bigger the tip...right?  I didn't understand the annoyance.   So about the food. AMAZING... Desserts...Ohhh holy hell yum! The treatment by staff....just a little too unprofessional I feel.  The food came out timed by them, not us in several courses.  It was imed well for the most part... but we were informed at 5:30 ish that our time was almost up (we were waiting for desserts)  and there was another party at 6.  #1... $1700 + drink tab for dinner we spent...#2 YOU timed the food... #3 NEVER say that to a customer.

They do serve mains, but I think the plates are the stars standout for us were the Tempura green Beans, I think these were lifted from Marlowe in San Fran, they've been a staple there for over 10 years. Only problem was this sweet cream cheese dip along with them . Did not work for me.    Veal meatballs good, with  distinct  veal taste. Tahini carrots and mac and cheese. We are not really Mac & C types , theirs  was very cheddary and really filling. Tahini carrots had a fair amount of charring, but were still very much crunchy ( I think they should have been tender)  and could have used more of the tahini. Decent beer  and wine selection along with many more plates  burgers  and flat breads. Trying to steer clear of massive carb intakes is tough at a small place like this. Our server  was really super nice and helpful , but the bar was rather slow. We liked everything but overall, given what is going on in the food world, I felt this place sounded and looked better than it tasted. Just not really satisfying. I think with a group , when you are not focused on the food, it would be a better experience.",

    "text": "Dang, what a great dinner. Came on a Friday night around 8:30, there was a small wait and we had just enough time to order drinks before we got seated at the kitchen counter. In a blink of an eye, food was already in front of us. Everything came out as the kitchen was ready, and man the kitchen works fast! Here's the dish:  -Gyro tacos: If you love gyros, you'll love this. It looks like a taco, tastes like a gyro. What's not to love. -Mac & cheese: I'm normally very picky about my mac and cheese because a lot of places bake it and then it dries out. This is dreamy, creamy, cheesy, deliciousness. -Sugar snap peas: With a harrisa cream and paprika butter, this was a little too greasy for me...like swimming in pools of grease. I liked the crunch of the snap peas, but probably my least favorite dish of the night. -Cocoa espresso strip steak: I almost never order steak unless it's a bone-in rib eye steak at a steakhouse...but we went for it and didn't regret it at all. The rub was really good and the meat was cooked to perfection. -Crispy chicken skins: So sinful, so addictingly good. The guy expediting food was really awesome and gave us a small sample of this on the side. It's very similar to chicharrones (pork rinds), with a side of honey to dip it in. It was the perfect combo of fatty + crunchy + salty + sweet.  Our cocktails were nice, I enjoyed the The Magarian. After we finished eating, we went out to the patio and enjoyed food coma-ing by the fire while finishing our last drink. Perfect on a cold desert night.",

That area is very nicely set up with lots of seating. Bummer the upstairs bar was closed so we were waiting without any drinks. We decided to explore the menu (too bad lots of things I saw in Yelp were no longer available - they change their menu a lot which is great for returning customers of course!). After about 30min we were seated by the bar. The one bartender was overwhelmed with work. She apologized and we were totally understanding, she was very friendly when she served us. We ordered drinks and 4 plates. I had the pink smoking jacket with a real smokey flavor to it. Good! And my partner had the Daaammmmn Daniel but on the rocks, which was fresh and tasted like a lemonade!  Tempura green beans: Delicious but totally different when combined with the sweet pepper cream cheese. I prefer without but both work. Serious portion!   Filet ohhh fish: Very good! Comes with hush puppies and ketchup, yummie!  Rainbow cauliflower: Good but after a while you are over it. Has a spicy aftertaste and I don't like spicy food but this didn't bother me. It was good but would be great with less salt.  Wild mushroom flatbread: Yasssss  so good!!!!!! My favorite yummy    We ordered several dishes because were thinking it's tapas style but nope these are large portions and we had to take home half of it. We were full with 2 for the 2 of us.",

Finding a restaurant on the strip for 20, for under $200pp was near impossible so we took our search downtown and ended up at Carson Kitchen and it was honestly one of the best meals I've had in Las Vegas, ever.  Our menu included several dishes, each one better than the last. The shrimp and flatbread were both outstanding. The oxtail risotto and salmon were fantastic. The crispy skin on the salmon makes me salivate just thinking about it. Dessert was donut bread pudding and bacon bourbon ice cream with a brownie. Both were delicious! The service was excellent and we happened to get a cooler summer night with made sitting on the private upstairs patio very pleasant. All in all a great meal with great people!",

Very tasty, rich and I could have stopped here.  BUT no, we then continued with some burnt ends, which were very tasty, great sauce, not quite smokey like I prefer,  but very good.  We got the cod, which is well caramelized with a sweet citrus flavor and a bit of heat.  Sauce was a but thicker and sweeter than I typically prefer, but as I said binge night and it was great.    I would definitely come back for the jerk, Turkey burger with tater tots. Big, juicy burger (made with applesauce) with some powerful, complex,  tasty spices.    Oh, yes, very nice salad, BLTA.  Pretty savory here with big thick chunks of bacon, avocado and romaine.    Great smaller place.  Great service.  Small plates fun for sharing.    In Old Town if you feel the need for a fun place, great atmosphere, fun and decadent food.  Get off the strip and explore Vegas.  I did roll out of there, a bit overstuffed but very happy.  I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "If you enjoy looking out large windows and observing the plight of some of Las Vegas's poorest while dining on 2 ounces of pork belly which you just paid $14 for, then this place is for you.  This place tries so hard to defy stereotypes and be completely different that it has legitimately become a stereotype.  From its \"come as you are\" dressed wait staff to the Edison bulbs and non-gender conforming bathroom sign, this place is as typical a hipster-foodie joint that you will ever find. I was surprised there wasn't live music performed by a local kazoo orchestra.  From, the moment we were seated our experience was on a downhill trajectory.  You see, everyone here must sit on stools and not the comfortable bar stools you might expect with a cushion, backrest or other body-conforming surface, oh no, these are small, hard, flat stools, typical of what you might find in a prison only not bolted to the floor.  The place is small, so I guess I can understand that these are space saving but I think the real purpose is to make people uncomfortable enough that they do not stay long and clear out to make room for the next party.  Larger customers, and folks with back problems beware.  Our plain-clothes waiter told us the menu items were designed for sharing so we ordered accordingly, my selection was two orders of the gyro tacos (so all six of us could try one) and an order of the pork belly.  The rest of the party ordered the mac & cheese, pork tenderloin, spicy shrimp, crab fondue, goat goulash and the Thai eggplant.  It seems like a lot of plates on the table, but the food comes out as its prepared which is great so its always piping hot and doesn't clutter the table and the staff was great about clearing empty plates.  Once the food arrived it became clear that I would be leaving hungry.  The tapas style works best when everyone at the table has similar food tastes but that wasn't really the case with our group.  Personally, I do not like seafood, so I avoided the crab and shrimp.  Another is not big on Thai or Asian flavors in general so no eggplant.  Still others were not keen on eating goat meat, and so you can kind of see how this might work better for the more open minded and non-picky eaters.  Not the fault of the restaurant but something to be aware of when coming here, but I digress.  I am just going to say it: the portions here are tiny.  Some might call this \"shareable\" portions or \"light eating\" but these are just euphemisms for tiny.  The gyro tacos I ordered were each about two bites worth of food.  I would consider a \"street taco\" size small for a taco and these were maybe half the size of one of those.  The mini flat-bread contained only a small amount of ground lamb so the mound of feta cheese was pretty much the dominant taste.  After finishing my two bites I decided I would have rather had either an actual gyro or taco.  When my wife and I arrived, we parked in a pay-to-park lot.  As far as I know there is no parking around that you do not have to pay for, so we paid $4 for two hours in a spot and walked half a block to the restaurant.  Despite the many improvements made to downtown it was impossible not to pass some of the homeless trying to sleep on the streets on this cold night.  Once in the restaurant we were seated by the front wall of window which meant we could see these folks occasionally shuffling by as we dined.  I am explaining this, so you understand how I felt when the pork belly arrived at the table containing four squares of meat, each about the size of a postage stamp.  The guilt of eating this expensive and pretentious meal was beginning to weigh heavier in my stomach than the food.  I understand spending extra money for a special occasion and high-quality food, but just because the food is high quality doesn't mean it's delicious and just because a restaurant can provide a dining experience doesn't mean that it's a good one.  The food at Carson Kitchen is high quality and a few things were delicious but ultimately, we left a lot of food on the plates (which is saying a lot considering the portions size). The bottom line is this, there are lots of places here in town where you can try interesting and delicious food that doesn't come with the guilt of paying a $200 bill and still leaving hungry.  Carson Kitchen tries hard to do what it does, but it just feels so ridiculous that I cannot take it seriously. When the bill arrived, it did not come in a typical bill holder but was instead bookmarked into an old library book with handwritten notes of past customers all over the pages.  I imagined the walls of the bathroom stalls probably looked something similar.  Hipster level 9 for sure. Two stars because the pork tenderloin was fantastic.",

I really liked the tacos but the Butter Burger stole the show. The meat was so tender and juicy but still tasted very lean and so fresh. The menu is really random but I dig it. I feel like they don't want to describe anything in detail and I couldn't even tell if there was a salad on the menu. Overall, the food and service was great and it's an awesome spot for hangover food. I especially like the open kitchen concept and even though it wasn't my first choice of seating it was refreshing to sit at the counter. The ambiance is dim and chill and it was pretty slow for a Sunday lunch. We are a couple of locals who had heard about this place since it had opened and we are so grateful we thought about going here for lunch. That's a lie, we wanted to go to Donut Bar but it was closed and I think everything happens for a reason so we stumbled in here and it was delightful and delicious.",

Coolest thing about the restaurant is the resto itself and the location its in. Great bar!  The neighborhood is in a revamped area of old town Vegas and the building itself is a renovated hotel where other businesses share office space. They string up lights outside in the patio with a nice little fire pit.   BUTTER BURGER - $14 (2.4/5) - The handful of tater tots were good. Ordered the burger medium rare and it came out tough, chewy, more like a well kneaded meatloaf burger. Not really buttery or juicy, on the smaller side. Should rename it the MEH-tloaf burger. Didn't think there was alot of value or anything special about it.

It was probably the best meal and the best service we received all weekend. The fried chicken sandwich made all my fried chicken dreams come True. My brother had the burger and he said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had.  The vibe of this place is really cool and fun. We were a little worried that walking in without a reservation with a party of 9 that there was no way we'd be seated, but they had a table for us and we were able to be sat right away.   We will definitely be back!",

The devilled eggs with caviar and bacon were wonderful, the black rice and oxtail risotto was full of flavor and pefectly cooked, and the jerk turkey burger with mango slaw also excellent.    The artichoke appetizer was a disappointment.  It was grilled, and yet oily, with very little meat in the leaves and a tiny heart.    Finally, step up your beer game and add a Belgian ale or two for a 5 star win.   The prices are actually amazingly low considering its in Vegas although on an outing the way street near Fremont st.",

With that said...the food is excellent. Tastes very fresh and it's different. We had the Mmm Ribs (which is a sandwich), jerk turkey, NY strip, & Black Rice Oxtail Risotto. My kids loves the rib sandwich and my husband and I loved the turkey burger and risotto.   But that's not the highlight. The dessert is with making the trip!!! The bourbon brownie is AMAZING. I can eat the ice cream all by itself. I do NOT like bread pudding but I tasted my husband's donut bread pudding and I can say that is the ONLY bread pudding I'd willingly eat.   The service is excellent from the hostess to the server. Roman, our server, was excellent. He explained everything without prompting and constantly made sure we were taken care of. We'd definitely come back we're in the area again.",

    "text": "Hopefully this restaurant never changes, because we love it just the way it is!  The deviled eggs have been on point every time we've ordered them (6-7 times now). That's perfect repetitive culinary execution.  The beet salad is simple yet awesome. A little beets, a little mandarin, a little pistachio goat cheese, some honey, makes me think dirty thoughts with my woman. Yes the food is that good that I get in a zone of food turns sex.  The salmon is surprisingly delicious as well. The spinach pesto spread is on point served with the salmon. The charred lemon squeezed over the salmon takes it over the top, and the spices on the salmon skin is on point yet again. Terrific. Good tasting seafood in Vegas is hard to come by but not at Carson.  I've had a few other items on the menu. But it's so hard to deviate away from the Deviled Eggs, Beet Salad, and Salmon every time I go to Carson Kitchen.  The only suggestion I'd like to make, is perhaps adding signature/special/seasonal/secret menu items each month/few weeks for your repeat customers who may want to trust your culinary imagination and ideas and have something new to look forward to or be surprised with. And that's just a suggestion. You are all awesome. Love the open kitchen.  Keep it up Carson Kitchen! It's not easy getting a 5 star review from me. But you deserve 5 stars so far! Just Don't get lazy, don't let it go to your head, and we will keep coming in every 2-3 weeks like clockwork!   Stay different stay delicious!",

Your asked if you did any sight seeing? What do you tell people about the food you had.  It's not everyday you can say you had Turducken Pot Pie, or a Wild Boar Sloppy Joe.  Carson Kitchen, a place I have seen many times on lists that name the best places to eat in Las Vegas. Therefore it was on my person top ten lists of places to try here in Las Vegas.  Service was awesome. We arrived 5-10 prior to opening at 11:30 on a Thursday morning. We were invited to sit in the patio area on the other side of the restaraunt. The atmosphere there was delightful!  Once seated, we were handed menus, and out waitress was awesome about going over the menu.I must say, of all places in Vegas that I have eaten, this one has the most intriguing menu.   My wife opted for the Wild Boar Sloppy Joe served with tator tots. That was my original choice, but since the wife picked it I went with the Turducken Pot Pie. We also decided to share an order of the Bacon Jam.  We took bites from each others meals, which is something we never do. But then again when is the last time we had either Wild Boar Sloppy Joes or Turducken Pot Pies? N-E-V-E-R!   Bottom line everything was delicious. As we left, I asked my wife how she liked everything? She replied \"It was great, but how do you find these places??\"  My reply was simply... \"Yelp.\"",

I recommend trying to make reservations, but they often don't take them. They will take your name down, but there are no guarantees over the phone. The place is also not the big so there is limited seating. You may have to sit at the bar if there are not any tables open. During the summers, you can enjoy the food and a drinks outside.   Service: Although the restaurant is busy, the service is still great. They try their hardest to be attentive to everyone.   Ambiance: Great place for you to hangout with friends and family! Come in to grab a quick bite to eat and then walk out to explore Downtown. You are pretty close to the nightclubs and bars. It is a bit loud, so be prepared to yell a bit as you talk to your peers.   Food: We can here mainly to grab a drink, but we did get two appetizers: The Crispy Chicken Skins w/ Smoked Honey and the \"Devil's Eggs\". Both were great. The Chicken skins is probably the best I have ever had and goes well with the honey. It is agreat sweet/salty combination. The Devil's eggs were also delicious as well.   Drinks: I got the moscow mule. It was made perfectly and served in the ideal copper cups. It was mixed well so it was very tasty. I would recommend getting the mule here.   Price: I would say it is decently priced with many of the menu items are tapas size. I would bring at least $40 bucks to cover food/drinks.   Have fun and enjoy yourself at Carson Kitchen's this weekend. :-D",

I appreciate the good customer service. You can have the best food, but if you have bad customer service your done for. In addition to customer service, servers will address that the dishes are small and are best eaten family style. Beware, the restaurant is packed sometimes. The food is definitely worth the wait. Though the food portion looks small, it will appease your stomach.",

I was hoping it'd appear in front of me.  On our last visit, we had the opportunity to sit at the seats right in front of the kitchen. I was initially a bit apprehensive about being next to the hustle and bustle, but wow. It was a totally unique experience, chatting with the staff about the dishes and watching the synchronicity of a well-managed kitchen. On top of the bacon jam, we had the cauliflower appetizer as well, both of which were delicious (but if you have to choose between these two, get the bacon jam, seriously). For my main course I got the fried chicken sandwich, which was prepared just right. Plus, the tots - delicious!   We'll definitely be back for a fourth visit.",

Once inside you will find a pretty small restaurant  (seating 40-50) with bar seating where you can watch the chefs and cooks do their thing.  We ordered a salad at $13 And a flatbread at  $13. Both were excellent. For the salad however there were no exotic ingredients (pear, goat cheese) but at several bites each I have to question the value. The flatbread on the other hand was a good value.",

Excellent marinade !), portobello flat bread (fabulous) and Ox tail risotto (sooo rich), brownie fudge butter bacon ice cream. If only they've had an espresso...

I got the gyro tacos and the black rice & oxtail risotto. The gyro tacos were delicious and I'd definitely get again. The oxtail risotto I was really excited for, but was a little disappointed with it because it was a little bland for me.  The restaurant looks really nice inside and the employees all seem friendly and nice. I'd definitely go again and dine in. I was just disappointed by the small portion and the oxtail risotto ):",

The burnt tips were really good the first time I went. But can't say the same the 2nd time. The 2nd time was actually burnt burnt. Way too hard.   The steak was good - couldn't taste any espresso flavor. But it was definitely too salty.   The beet and goat cheese dish was subpar. Not enough balsamic.  The turkey burger was huge! but the chutney was pretty tasty. Didn't taste any jerk flavor though.   The tacos were so good the first time! gyro meat cooked perfectly. The shell was warm and soft. 2nd time around - the shell was STALE AND NASTY and not enough sauce.   The risotto was good but WAY TOOOOOO SALTY.    Overall, based on my 1st experience I rate it a 5 star. And based on my 2nd experience - I give it 2 star. So about aver is 3.5 stars.",

Space is at a premium in their close-packed space, so expect communal seating to be a more likely fate than a private table.  The dish portions and pricing seem to indicate they're more the \"we're not here to engorge you, we're here to delight you with good tasting food\" kind of place.   We ordered the \"Devil's\" Eggs, Roasted Young Beets, Rabbit Ragu and Duck Confit Flatbread. The \"Devil's\" Eggs were ridiculously delicious. The Roasted Young Beets with goat cheese and orange slices was interesting and good. The Rabbit Ragu wasn't so great. Although alright, I couldn't taste any rabbit flavor over the spiciness of the sauce. And the duck in the Duck Confit Flatbread was tasty.  The service is top-notch, but also a bit pandering with their, \"You've made some excellent choices.\" I'd like to think that if I ordered ANYTHING from their menu it would be an excellent choice. But I really appreciated the effort.  If you're looking for a bit of a culinary adventure in a very social eating space, then you'll likely enjoy an experience at Carson Kitchen.",

    "text": "This place has such a great vibe and  decorated beautifully. There's communal style dining and separate tables with and open kitchen. I love the touch of a \"Swear Jar\" on the kitchen counter. I've also heard that the rooftop patio is open but didn't go up there because it was 100 degrees outside.   Tara was our server and she was attentive and funny. She even made the cocktails we ordered behind the bar, talk about a girl that can multitask!   Crispy Chicken skins - this dish is amazing for people that love fried food. It's not greasy or oily and is seasoned perfectly. It comes with a side of honey to dip it in.  Perfect mix of salty and sweet.   Black rice and Oxtail risotto - my favorite risotto I've eaten. The first bite made my jaw drop because I enjoyed it so much, especially the parmesan cream it was in. I can't explain all the flavors in it but it's a dish I would get every visit here.   Veal Meatballs - sherry Foie Gras cream and peas. The sauce was very light and added the perfect touch to the meatballs.   Chicken thighs - the citrus chimichurri sauce made so savory with the juicy chicken.   As for cocktails, we tried Drink With The Ms. (pig's nose whiskey, amaro del sole, grapefruit juice, fresh lime, maple syrup, crabbie's ginger beer) and The Margarian (aviation gin, thyme & honey syrup, fresh lemon, mr. q cumber soda). Both were extremely refreshing on a scorching summer day in Vegas.   I'm already looking at the menu to decide what to eat in my next visit. Can't wait! And yes, this place is that good!!!  FYI: the restaurant is located in the newly refurbished John E. Carson Hotel. We had a tough time finding it at first because we entered through the Bikram Yoga door. It fastest to just walk around the building on the outside and stay on Carson.",

I usually go for the beet salad and then any meet entree.  Gyro pitas are always great, and they make an exceptionally good chicken sandwich.  Drinks are good too.

Located right in heart of the revamped DTLV, behind the eclectic famous \"Fremont street\", Carson Kitchen is hidden with no large sign, the food speaks for itself.    As we walked in we were greeted quickly by the hostess. Very nice, sleek, tiny restaurant with a cute small bar, open concept with views to the kitchen.  The food: small menu, small portions tapa style maybe?  We got the... Tempura Green Beans: good flavor not overly battered comes with a pepper cream cheese dip. This was good.   Beef Wellington Empanadas: 2 in a order, not bad flaky crust comes with a sherry sauce? Idk but this was nice.   Crispy Chicken Skins: comes with honey dipping sauce. Think of fried pork skins.. Super crispy, this would go excellent with a nice cold beer. Good flavor, a bit on the salty side. I feel like this didn't need the seasoning really.   Caribbean Jerk Turkey Burger: eh I didn't like this. Maybe the fact that I don't really care for cole slaw, which by the way was the only thing in it. Burger became soggy. It had a pumpkin spice kinda flavor and it was kinda sweet ehh..    I liked when each item came to our table the server described what it came with. The food came out in good timing. We were there for probably just 45 mins.  The service was good she checked on us a few times. This place would be great after a night of drinking and you want something good, and savory! But they close early in Vegas standards at 11pm.   I will return!",

I arrived at 5:45 and there was a 30 min wait for a table so we decided to have dinner at the bar. We were greeted by an Irish bartender with a large personality. I ordered the Mac & cheese, jerk turkey burger, and glazed donut bread pudding. The Mac & cheese was the best macaroni I have had in a very long time. The noodles were still al dente even though they were sitting in a creamy sauce and baked in the oven. Flavor was bold and I enjoyed the bread crumbs on the top, however they were only on half of the dish. When I tasted the burger all I could taste was the potent star anise spice. Burger had potential but the spice ratios need to be toned down. I barely touched the side of tater tots because they were too greasy. I thought the dessert was decadent and very moist for a bread pudding.",

The Butter Burger was so good, along w the Mac n Cheese, which was more creamy than gooey cheese. I personally like more gooey/melty cheese. And the Fried Chicken Skins were awesome. I know it may sound like a turn off to most but they are crunchy and flavorful. Give them a try you won't be disappointed. The outside of the restaurant has windows that are grayed out so we almost thought it was closed down for a second.

It was also a big enough burger to split between two people. The flat bread while looking kind of skimpy on the toppings was also full of flavor. It was cheesy, gooey, and had a slight crunch. Since we were seated at the bar, the bartender explained the menu to us and told us most of their menu items are smaller sizes but I truly felt like the portions were standard.

Yelpers recommend the Crispy Chicken Skins, the Bacon Jam Baked Brie Baguette and the Wild Mushroom Flatbread .....what should I order...... not able to decide made me order them ALL.... I was not disappointed.  They were delicious with amazing taste.  A great little place you have to visit while in Vegas.",

The Bacon jam was just perfect to start, fried green beans and crispy chicken skins were another great choice for the group to share. I ordered the fried green tomato burger, enjoyed it not too sure about the tartar sauce, however, I enjoyed it.  The desert, bread pudding and icream (with bacon) was heavenly. Am really impressed with this place.  Loving how downtown Las Vegas is getting great eatery places. Look forward to my next visit.",

They were pretty delicious, especially the cream cheese it comes with. The veal meatballs were also very good. The bacon jam...unbelievable. I'll just leave it at that. Bourbon fudge brownie was a nice finish to a wonderful meal.  Service: Our waitress was very very attentive. Almost to the point were she seemed like she was rushing us...She still did an excellent job, however. My only problem with the service was actually at the very beginning of the meal. The hostess seemed visibly annoyed when I asked simply if they had a high chair for my son. which they did not.  Decor: The place is very stylish, with twisted metal and views of the street. The place was clean and orderly, although a bit small.",

We took in a late lunch/early dinner or as Janeane Garofalo said it best, \"Lupper or Linner\"  At 3pm the restaurant was completely vacant on a Thursday  We had the opportunity to meet the staff and crew on a more intimate level.  They had just come off of introducing new items to their menu and Brandon and Lina were very gracious   Our picks to share for two included: the deviled eggs, veal meatballs, BLTA salad, black rice risotto with oxtail, wild mushroom flatbread, tomato bisque and the donut bread pudding for dessert  Great attention to details in each dish for flavors and presentation  It was a joy to have the staff's attention as we can imagine the chaos the line endures at peak times  Highly recommend Carson to everyone who wants honest food lacking any pretense",

We were gluttons and ordered way too much food (4 dishes for 2 people) and didn't finish everything, but the prices were reasonable and we couldn't narrow it down! We had seats at a bar overlooking the kitchen and really enjoyed watching all the food being made.   The awesome - bacon jam and veal meatballs. OMG. Get them both, please! The meatballs weren't attractive, but they tasted really great and were in the  most delicious foie gras sherry sauce.. I really wanted to lick the plate!   Eh - Chicken skins were too spicy for us to really enjoy and honestly ate like pork rinds. I was expecting more and wasn't overly impressed. Basically think pork rinds in a basic spicy salt blend. Meh. The chili cheese dog flat bread was just OK as well. Not enough sour cream, chili was overly spicy and hot dogs weren't special. I like the idea of a chili cheese dog pizza but it wasn't as yummy as I was hoping.   WTF - $3.50 coke served in an 8 ounce glass bottle. The same ones used at the high end restaurants on the strip. Who the hell wants 8 ounces of soda? I'm not surprised high end restaurants on the strip pull this but I was annoyed by this crap at an off the strip joint. I expected at least a 12 ounce glass bottle for that price.   Overall really great and worth checking out! This is the best Kerry Simon restaurant I've tried!",

On my initial bite, I honestly didn't know what to make of it. However, the more I ate and (as a fellow patron encouraged) mixed the gremolata with the rice I really enjoyed it! It's not quite as creamy as a typical risotto as black rice does not cook as glutinous as other rice varieties. It is very flavorful and rich and the gremolata really cuts into the dish and adds another dimension in flavor. The reason I'm docking a star is because my plate did not have very much oxtail. This is a pet peeve of mine and it's happened twice with oxtail being mentioned as a main ingredient to a dish. If it's part of the description, it should be showcased generously. I would definitely come again for this dish and it's one that I will be thinking about for awhile.  Service was friendly and large communal seating around the bar was interesting. Decor was very tasteful and thoughtful considering the tight space.",

The food is tapas style and the decor is kitch contemporary.  It reminded me of a little place in Ballard Seattle called Bastille. I give one star for service, which was very friendly and expedient. One star for food and presentation.  The dishes were very unique in style and great for sharing. One star for pricing, as the food was adequate in amount for the quality you are receiving. I give the last star for atmosphere. I would have loved to try the outdoor seating but you have to be 21 for that. It was still lovely indoors as well. It was just chilly and a little loud inside for conversation. All in all, I would come back here again. It's a memorable place.",

Plan on arriving early (5:45/6) to be able to quickly grab a table, or wait 30-45 minutes depending on the night.    If you can, try and grab a seat at the bar overlooking their kitchen. Also try the fried chicken skin with smoked honey, the veal meatballs, or their chicken sandwich.  A good selection of small bites and appetizers allows you to really experience what Carson Kitchen has to offer.",

Nothing in the menu shows jalapeno etc. Same thing with Hawaiian flat bread and veal meatballs were fiery hot. The Devils eggs were great and cooled things down a bit.  Just be clear in the menu when things are spicy.",

And after going back for a second visit for dinner after an Elite event downtown, Carson Kitchen has skyrocketed to the top of my list spots to dine downtown.   I have been lucky on each of my visits to be seated at the chef's 'table' (really more of a counter), where I have had a full view of the kitchen and been able to interact with the fun and entertaining staff.   Service here has always been on point for me... I can't recall the name of the adorable, rockabilly-ish blonde that has been my waitress on every visit, but I adore her. She fits right in with the \"rock and roll hipster\" vibe Carson Kitchen has going on.  Literally EVERY item I have had here I would order again... but I do have some favorites:  Bacon Jam: Everything I could have wanted and then some. Salty, sweet, creamy AND crunchy... A culinary grand slam. Tempura Green Beans: I have been craving the pepper jelly cream cheese served with the tempura green beans for weeks now. It is the perfect compliment to the addictive green beans. The Secret Sunday Chicken Sandwich: Simple yet perfectly done... Juicy chicken, aioli with just a slight kick, delicious bun.  Prices are very fair for the caliber of the food being served up. Carson Kitchen is a must when dining downtown in my opinion.",

Being from San Francisco I can see how this type of restaurant is fresh to folks in Las Vegas but to be honestly we were not too impressed by the offering. Cocktails are really light and we asked to make it heavier our server didn't gives us heads up that they will charge extra ( for the record, we saw the bartender, Chris, pour extra and he did few drops while giving us this look. ) amd we ended up being charged extra 7$ for the extra drops. The server even told my friend that \" you know good drink doesn't mean it has to have a lot of alcohol\" she even asked me how much tip I want to leave after I complained about the situation. I would really skip this place, you can do a lot better in Vegas.",

Thankfully none of the lettuce spilled out but the lid landed on the floor with the inside flooring facing. He picked it up off the floor and placed the lid on the full tub of lettuce. Not thank you, I refuse to pay $10 for a salad that has sat all day rubbing up against something that fell on the dirty ass floor. I will never return here and need to tell everyone I know to do the same.  UPDATE: they've made certain to threaten me through personal message. I'm supposed to let you all know after he put it back in the fridge, some time later the lettuce was taken to the back and water was run over it. So no worries. It was only exposed to the floor for a bit and I don't know what I'm talking about. There, is that right? Did I say what I was supposed to, will you not threaten me again? Thanks.  gotta LOVE this customer service (below)",

Located near downtown, this restaurant offers scrumptious dishes and an upbeat/modern atmosphere with a super friendly staff.  We visited this restaurant for date night, and wished we had discovered it sooner! We brought our own bottle of wine ($20 corkage fee), and enjoyed some of their signature dishes:  * Fried chicken skins- A MUST try. Seasoned and fried to golden perfection, these are the perfect opener for any meal.  * Bacon and brie jam- Sweet, tangy and a bit spicy. The mixture of flavors in this dish are just awesome and will surely have you coming for more.  * Turkey burger- Yes, I know it sounds plain. The truth is, this sandwich is anything BUT plain. With tropical and jerk seasoning flavors, this is the BEST burger I have had. In fact, you will leave that place in love with the explosion of flavors in the dish.  * Last but not least, we had the doughnut bread pudding which was the perfect desert for the night. Fluffy, sweet and heavenly, this is the best bread pudding in town!  I thank you for reading my review now, as I know you will thank me for writing it once you experience this place.",

I understand mistakes happen, but the restaurant handled it very poorly. Even after the first manager, the only offer was to comp the meal never received and then for a free dessert. Thanks for not making me pay for food I never got! And not really interested in dessert when I never got dinner. For what seems like a cool restaurant, I would have expected a mistake like this to be handled better. Was really looking forward to this dinner but now wouldn't recommend the restaurant.  Update: I appreciated a quick response by restaurant owner to learn more about the situation and try to make it right. Still frustrated over my experience since it seemed like there was little priority that night to fix a problem. A meal was missed and the rest of my party was long done with their plates cleared and still no missing meal. However, I realize mistakes do happen and I appreciate the owners follow up. Everyone else's food looked great - hopefully processes change.",

Matthew is simply the best and he flexed when our reservation for 8 turned into 4 with a surprise 5th showing up at the last minute.  The veal meatballs were perfect if you like the Swedish style meatball vibe.  The fried chicken skin served with honey is excellent but the star of the show is always the baked bacon jam with brie.  Extra points to anyone who uses the chicken skin as a bacon jam delivery vehicle.  The devils' eggs are just a perfect balance of a little sweet, a little salty and a whole lot of great egg flavor.  The pork belly was a table favorite and, after a few minutes to cool down to a mouth friendly temperature, was a salty, sweet little bit of crunch and happy pork fat bite of ridiculous flavor.  The macaroni and cheese is just a wonderful blend of cheeses and elbow macaroni.  The bar made every cocktail to perfection.  The deserts we had (bread pudding and the chocolate cake with ice cream) shut down the table as we were just in a food happiness coma.  Seriously, if you haven't been here yet I'd give it a try and you will not be disappointed.  Carson Kitchen keeps bringing it strong and is a reliable five star all star.  Thank you again to the staff for another wonderful experience!",

It's one of those locally known, must-hit spots in downtown Las Vegas.  Just know that you might miss it when walking by.  There's not much advertising and it's down a pretty empty road off to the side of Fremont.  But you walk in and they have an upstairs, outdoor area for eating, a downstairs patio, lounge area, and then your typical restaurant, inside, as well.  The ambiance is great for a nice evening out.  The menu is a little limited but all very unique and delicious.  Sizes vary, but 3 orders for a group of 2 people is probably fine for most of the dishes.  The prices are very fair and coming to Carson Kitchen won't put you back too much like other finer dining venues in town.  The quality of the food is right on par with those higher end venues, but this place is cheaper and gives you that local feel.  The staff is great, the food is great, and the venue is great.  Have a nice night out and go to Carson Kitchen.  You won't regret it.",

I ordered the chicken skins. This item is what brought me here in the first place. The spicy honey sauce was great, I just felt like the skins were a little overcooked. 3 stars. I also ordered the *Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto* which was fabulous. 5 stars. The black rice had an interesting texture and the oxtail was tender and rich. I would return for this dish, for sure. I'd also return for the dessert. The *Glazed Donut Bread Pudding* was SO good. 5 stars, again. My husband's chicken sandwich was ok. Not bad but not great. 3 stars. Not quite worth the price of admission. The BBQ Burnt Ends were just that. Burnt and dry. I thought it was a clever idea, but it just didn't hit the mark for me. 2 stars. Considering the price of the bill and how satisfied I was with everything, I would probably lean toward 3 stars but I'm hoping that I maybe I caught them on an off day or maybe there are other items on the menu that are fantastic.",

We were seated right away (and totally comfy in our pool party attire) at the counter next to the kitchen. We shared the strawberry & cucumber salad, charred octupus, mac & cheese, and pork chop. Everything was cooked to perfection! We were stuffed and the server asked if wanted dessert and of course we said \"naaaah...\" but the chef said we should really try the brownie. My goodness!! Brown butter ice cream with bacon served over a brownie! I'm SO glad we tried it.   It was such a nice experience from beginning to end.

    "text": "If you're visiting town and tire quickly of the Strip, the downtown area is a short Deuce or taxi/Lyft ride away. It's increasingly buzzing with foodie-friendly places like Carson Kitchen, which serves scrumptious fare that's reasonably priced given the quality and portions that you get.  I tried a fried chicken sandwich which turned out to be positively gigantic. It came with a yummy \"secret\" aioli and also came served with a nice helping of tater tots. It all washed down well with a couple of glasses of beer and cider - here, it's worth noting that they have quite the good boozy selection. There were many other tasty-looking items on the menu like jerk turkey burgers, beet salads, strip steaks, and flatbreads that I didn't get to try, but if you're stopping by, it'll be worth coming with a small group, getting a bunch of different things, and having everyone share or at least mooch a bite off each other's plates.   The space itself feels a bit compact in the way people are spaced from each other, with the advantage to this being that things feel a bit more open and social than it would, say, at a Strip resort bar or restaurant where you'd have lots of space for your party to lounge and stretch out. Service was fast and professional, and the venue is just a short walk away from the nearest Deuce stop.",

    "text": "Why, why, WHY have I not been here before???  I can't believe my hotel concierge took this long (I'm talking years) to recommend Carson Kitchen. I had some friends from Boston visiting for our annual New Year's celebration, and the day after the nutso celebrations, we were looking for what breakfast/brunch places were open. The only qualification? It had to be amazeballs.  Carson Kitchen is located next to the Donut Bar, and has one of the most nondescript front entrances I have ever (or never) seen. Our limos had driven by at least twice, looking for something resembling a eatery or gastro pub of some sort. It wasn't until I pulled up WAZE and stepped out onto the curb that I realized I was standing right in front of it. It was hidden right in plain site, and I LOVED it.  One of the first things you'll immediately notice is the amazing service. It honestly had a small town friendly vibe to it, which I never expected to find in downtown Vegas..... or Vegas in general, where everything is so commercially corporate, and friendly but superficial. Carson Kitchen was warm, like Biddeford, Maine, or Snyder, Texas.  We were table of 9, including five kids and teens, so probably the most fickle bunch of eaters this side of the Mississippi. But we had this amazing communal table, and just went to town. I ordered every one of the share dishes, and the kids had their mac n cheese and grilled cheese with short rib sandwiches. Here are my thoughts:  1) Grillled cheese with short ribs: GREAT! Wow. It tasted like something I'd expect after a night of debauchery in N'awlins. Perfect morning-after food.  2) bacon jam. This is a twist from what I'm used to, and the Bostonians weren't crazy about it, but I'm a bacon jam connoisseur, and this stuff was artisanal. It comes out sizzling with a strip of baked brie right down the middle. Truly next-level stuff!  3) Veal meatballs in sherry foie gras cream sauce. So I have to be honest. The meatballs were bit overcooked when we got them, so probably not as great as they should have been. But the combo with that sauce is simply amazing. My suggestion is request that the meatballs not be overcooked when you order them. But I'll say this much. These were REAL meatballs. Not the sausage-like chewy crap you'll find in frozenfood meatballs.  4) Fried chicken skins. Okay.... this one is for a chosen few. I spent some time growing up in Indonesia, so this is normal fare for me. I also have friends from Wisconsin and N'awlins, where this kind of stuff is normal. if you're turned off by the idea of chicken skins (lots of people are), then skip it. But if you like it, order it. I LOVED it, especially with their smoked honey dipping sauce. It tastes like pork rinds, but are an amazing comfort food for those that know what it is- crunchy comfort.  5) BBQ ends. I can't remember if I'm calling this right, but it's the end pieces of what I think are beef ribs, grilled to crunchy perfection. These cubes of succulence were exactly the kind of thing I wanted to round off the savory part of breakfast. I elect these the ultimate Superbowl snack of choice that goes perfectly with your coldest of brews.  6) The OMG. The Finale. The coup-de-gras..... is the glazed donut bread pudding. In all honesty, if we simply ordered 9 of these, we all would have been more than satisfied. This was the most amazing thing I've had in a long time. It was everything you think sex should be if it was a dessert. Soft, bouncy, moist, creamy, and just the right about of sweet. Truly impressive.  Obviously, I love this place. Highly recommend it, and will definitely be coming back on a regular basis.",

The bartender said there were going to expand in the coming months to take over the tattoo shop next door, where they will have a proper bar.  All the waitresses wear old rock and roll t-shirts, I asked about it and the gals said the owner used to cater for bands.  We ordered a bunch of things to split (apparently the menu changes quarterly):  -Gyro tacos -Crispy chicken skin - Never seen this on a menu, served with honey, we asked for hot sauce too, which they should just serve with it -Black risotto with oxtail - Loved it, want to try and find black rice to re-create it -Veal Meatballs with a sherry fois gras cream sauce - these were my favorite! -Bread doughnut pudding - the Yelp reviews said this were great, but I found it unremarkable  I kinda wish we had ordered the bacon jam with brie, everyone around us who ordered it loved it.",

    "text": "Many savory options on the menu that's great for a light bite!  --- Rum/Coke - 3/5 Stars - this was okay. It seemed like the bartender slipped in a little too much rum and ice in my glass. Baked Mac and cheese - 3.5/5 Stars - their Mac and cheese was incredibly creamy and savory and I loved it! But why the 3.5 you're asking? It's way too small to be paying $13 for it. The size is almost the same size as a side at a local fried chicken shop.  --- Service - 5/5 Stars - My friends and I came here at around 6-7PM and it wasn't incredibly busy! Our waitress Eugenia was incredibly kind to my group of 8 and was very patient with us. The lighting is a little bit dark but your eyes will adjust. So for those who have a hard time seeing in dim lighting ask to be seated at the bar or directly under a lightbulb. Overall - 4/5 Stars - You're kind of forced to buy yourself an appetizer to get you fully satisfied at the end of your meal. But on the plus side, their food is amazing! If they could match the serving size with their price I would definitely be giving 5/5 stars. I'll definitely be back to try more of what's on their menu but I'll come back with a heavier wallet or a half full stomach haha.",

I wanted some good substantial food before the Vegas to Bakersfield drive.    We had ordered the pork belly, caviar devil eggs, and the crab cheese fondue. We shared between three people and it was perfect. Pork belly had a buffalo sauce on top, tricked you into thinking chicken wings. Deviled eggs were tasty and had a very nice presentation. The cheese!!! was so good. It was served hot on a cast iron dish with sliced bread. Everything was spot on, no complaints.  Dessert we all shared the glazed donut bread pudding. YUM  If you are in the area and like to try something new, I would recommend.",

I was really excited to eat here, as I had only read rave reviews and heard great things but my experience was excessively average, which is disappointing for a restaurant so hyped. I ordered the broccoli, which came raw with seeds and cranberries and in a green goddess sauce. The sauce was good but it didn't pack a ton of flavor. Plus, the broccoli was raw! It would have been better grilled, broiled, anything. I then had the Sunday chicken burger. The chicken was perfectly crispy but again it didn't have an innovative or inventive flavor. The side of tater tots was good. However, for raw broccoli and fried chicken I want to be wowed and impressed, which did not happen today.",

We were greeted quickly and sat at the counter looking into the kitchen. Since it was our first time I wanted to try a little of everything so we ordered the crispy chicken skin($9) and the devils eggs($8). The skins were out of this world. It's a basket full of deep fried chicken skin with a spicy smoked honey sauce that was out of this world. The eggs were piled high and had a dollop of caviar on top. Pancetta was sprinkled on top as well. Very well done and super tasty. we ordered the Gyro tacos (3 for $12) and they were yummy. It was like an open face gyro with lamb and tzatziki in a street taco size. For our next course we had the black rice oxtail risotto ($14) and the sea bass ($22). The risotto was cooked perfectly and super tasty. The sea bass was grilled and came with crispy skin (I guess I like skin) and a cauliflower tabbouleh over the top. A squiggly chili oil sauce was on the plate for dragging the fish through and it was so yummy together. We ate everything we were given and enjoyed each course. My wife liked the fish best, I picked the risotto as my favorite. We could see what was going out of the kitchen and the beet salad, Brussels sprouts Caesar salad and Mac and cheese seemed to be very popular so we'll try those next time for sure. Service was excellent and efficient. Great time, can't wait to go back",

    "text": "Carson Kitchen is my favorite DTLV restaurant. It is one of the few restaurants that never, ever disappoints whether I'm having my usual go-tos such as The Devils Eggs, or the Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip. The consistency is always on point.   Not only are the \"resident\" dishes all amazing, but their seasonal features are always memorable and leaves me wanting to come back as much as I can, knowing that these particular dishes may not be around forever. One example was a watermelon salad from last year, it was hands-down the best I've ever had and I was so bummed I never made it back there in time to have it once more before it was gone for the season.   Another great dish that rolled out with the new winter menu is the phenomenal Chicken Thighs served with mushroom marsuvio. I am not one to ever order chicken at restaurants but I've had this dish twice in one week because I couldn't stop thinking about it the first time. I really hope this one stays around for good.  Service is always warm, friendly and personable. I love sitting at the chef's counter when it's just me or another person. Drinks are great, my particular favorite is a paloma type drink called the Get Shorty which comes with a Tajin rim. To round out my delicious meal, I always go with the Donut Bread Pudding which is made with the neighboring Donut Bar's famous donuts.",

Service was good, food was delicious and generous portions for tapas style dishes and we walked out with a food coma for the ride home.   We ordered (in order of deliciousness): Tempura string beans- super crunchy with a surprisingly good cream cheese dip Sunday fried chicken sandwich- perfectly salt-brined fried white meat Gyro tacos- tender and balanced with cool yogurt cucumber sauce  Oxtail risotto- great texture of purple rice and flavor  Brussels sprouts Caesar- great tangy dressing  Mushroom flatbread- familiar with a twist of Indian spices  Cocoa espresso strip steak- different.. wasn't a huge fan of the bitterness of the rub and the fennel seed used   The dessert to end the meal: GLAZED DONUT BREAD PUDDING!! my fiance is a huge fan of bread puddings and I got to say, this one was the best we've ever had. I just wish it came with a scoop of ice cream :)   Definitely a refreshing take of farm to table, American (new) category in the Las Vegas food scene!",

    "text": "My boyfriend came here with some friends without me and he couldn't stop raving about it being his favorite place he's eaten so far in Vegas. On this trip, he brought me and two friends back to try it out. The menu is great for sharing (all portions, including the main courses, are tiny portions) and the prices are really reasonable - almost everything is under $20.   We got the cocoa-espresso steak (my personal fav, cooked perfectly), the tempura green beans (the cream cheese was amazing), the mac and cheese, the pork belly, the gyro tacos, the killer shrimp, and the oxtail risotto (the dish I couldn't wait to try, but was my least favorite - it was a bit too al dente and had such a unique taste to all of us that I just couldn't make myself love it - I even got the rest to go and, despite being hungover and starving the next day, I still couldn't force myself to eat it).   I have to say, I was so beyond full before we even got here that I could barely have more than a bite or two of each dish, so I feel like my review is more focused on the group's thoughts, but everyone loved the dishes so much and were so glad we came here that I wouldn't hesitate to go back.",

Ordered 2 cocktails (delicious) and the Chicken Skins and Deviled Eggs, which were both incredible.  I can't wait to go back for a full meal!!   The only thing that is keeping me from giving 5 stars is how hot it was in the restaurant.

We ordered the gyro tacos, butter bread burger and the glazed donut bread pudding. The portions are a little larger than tapas but definitely satisfying. It allows for you to finish with the most amazing dessert! This restaurant is a short distance from the main area of Fremont Street.

The prices weren't bad considering the fact that the food is so good. Service was great as well. The Killer Shrimp was soooo goood!

They sat us at the communal table, I was fine with it and had some interesting conversations. However, I could see how if someone was shy or didn't enjoy talking to strangers how they might not enjoy sitting there. The decor was industrial modern.   We split the chicken skins with smoked honey - which was awesome! The skins were crispy and the honey gave it the perfect sweet to contrast the salt. Also, it was one of the more reasonable items on the menu at $6.   Wellington Empanadas - they were good but I wouldn't order them again. They were really salty, and to me part of the beauty of the wellington is how well they are cooked -while the phyllo dough likened itself to a wellington the filling was chopped beef and other vegetbales. Thus at $10 not my favorite item.   The short rib sliders with spicy tator tots - three sliders for $14. A little over priced. The sliders had a sweet flavor to them and a crunch from french fried onion the bun. There was not much sauce on them either. My friend likened them to a marshmallow flavor of a rice krispy treat, while I don't completely agree with her I found it amusing. Again, good but not phenomenal and I think I would try something else.   Duch Confit Flatbread - very good, again sweet like the flatbread was brushed with honey - however, very very small portion. Possibly six inches in length by four inches or so across. Also, the flatbread was not crisp on the bottom, however the flavor was good. $10.   Glad I tried it, loved the chicken skins, but a little pricey for what you receive for my taste but it is a Kerry Simon restaurant. If you go for lunch go early - they fill up fast with the downtown work crowd. If there are only two of you expect to be seated at the communal area.",

Deviled Eggs - covered in bacon??  Yes, please!  Tater Tots - never fails.  Crispy, yummy, fried tots of joy.  Chilli Cheese Dog Flatbread - looked amazing when it came out but tasted like what it sounds like, and I'm not a fan of chili dogs so I'm biased.  Pork Belly Carbonara - BLEW MY MIND!  So good!  Definitely the best dish.  Came with a fried egg yolk, which was like a soft-boiled egg but no whites and covered in bread crumbs and Parmesan.  Soooo good!

My girlfriend loves the tempura green beans and today we also tried the wild mushroom flatbread and I will be dreaming about the pickled tomatoes that top it until I eat it again. Seriously some of the best food in Vegas high quality and super fresh! We can't wait to try the cocoa-espresso NY strip and the baked Mac and cheese! We will come as often as we can!",

Kinda hipstery, but still pretty casual... And one more time so it sticks in your head... Bacon Jam.",

    "text": "Shrimp dunderi - basically heavenly little pillows of ricotta with two perfectly flavorful shrimp on top. The limoncello sauce - I almost tried to lick every ounce from the bowl!   The crispy chicken skins. Had to send them back. I guess I'm not a fan of eating something that reminds me of the crispy bits at the bottom of the seafood basket from Long John Silver's. Smothering it in honey didn't help much. I'm sure other people would love this. Just too much fried goodness for me.  If you order the veal meatballs - prepare for a very rich dish. The use of peas was a nice bit of sweetness to compliment the savory foie gras cream.   Dessert - well I had to have it. All four options sounded so unique. They had me at 'macaron' with the rhubarb sammie. More like GIANT macaron. I've never seen one so big. It's what made up the sandwich part of the 'sammie'. I loved how it wasn't overly sweet.  Another fantastic option away from the craziness of the strip. You get waaaay better food for a better price when you travel downtown. Will be back to Carson Kitchen!",

BBQ burnt end was really well designed -- sweet-spicy brisket, not salty but savory pickles, ranch sauce with fresh dill, and Texas toast. This combination made an amazing ensemble of a completed dish. Our server, Brook, was professional and did the best to help us enjoy the brunch.",

We had the gyro tacos, bacon jam and cheese, the steak, mac and cheese, charred octopus salad, and the ox tail risotto. All were fantastic! To finish that all off we had the bread pudding. My wife does not like bread pudding, but she couldn't keep her fork out of it! They have an  outside area on the second floor. The kitchen is open to the seating area so you can watch your food being prepared! Great industrial modern look! We will definitely be back again!",

We had the delicious Wellington Empenada, the AMAZING Mac-n-cheese, the crunchy broccoli, the buttery burger and tasty tots, and lastly the beautiful rainbow cauliflower. (These are my adjectives, not theirs)   With an open kitchen, a big bar, a back patio and a rooftop, they created a cool, hip vibe! The hostess was super friendly and welcoming. The server seemed happy to be at work and proud of the food he was serving us. Then the bill comes out in a vintage book that previous guests have signed. So from first impressions to last impressions, it was consistently a pleasant surprise. The next time I take a visitor downtown, this is where we're going! I can't wait to experience their night time ambiance. I bet it's rad.",

Very helpful with the menu and giving us great detail about each item.    We ended up ordering Chicken Skins, ok but I'm not a big fan. Although they were better with the Bacon Jam, which was also good.    We also tried the Shrimp Dunderi, Gnocchi made from Ricotta cheese instead of potatoes, it was also very tasty and the Shrimp were huge but you get two...keep that in mind if you are splitting.     All in all I thought it was just 'ok' nothing to brag about or write home about, it was pretty pricy in my opinion but I may not have felt that way if I really, really thought the food was to die for.  That being said, they change the menu about every three months so maybe I'll try again, but maybe I'll just go to the Donut Bar next door!!",

Maybe after 15 min wait we were seated on the center large high counter table. I checked yelp reviews and ordered four tapas size plates (although they recommend only three. We were hungry!);  1. Bacon jam with baked Brie and baguette. OMG!!! This is just amazing and I can see myself going back for this. Definitely my fav...pretty addictive..  2. Devils eggs- very good   3. Hawaiian Spam sliders - gotta get anything with spam!  Very good!!  4. Mac 'n cheese - this is very good also.

I didn't give 4 stars because of the portion size but also because of the volume of the music.  Ok, I get it, I might be a bit older than their normal clientele, but it felt like I was in a club, not a restaurant.  I brought my book to read while I ate but that was not possible.  I even think conversation wouldn't be comfortable.  Maybe it's just me but loud rock and roll (even good rock music) during dinner doesn't increase my appetite. It's just annoying.  Staff was very friendly and polite.  I might try again but next time I'll not be too hungry and bring ear plugs:-)",

Members in attendance: Angela d., Sumana S., Trevor Y., Wayne T. , and Dennis K.  I. Ordering Between the 5 of us, we ordered 2 Butter Burgers - boursin, cheddar, lettuce, tomato ($14). We ordered it medium rare and it comes with spicy tater tots. We also ordered some of their cocktails.   II. The burgers The burger had too much cheese! It comes with boursin and 2 slices of cheddar, which wasn't melty (sad). It was overpowering. Trevor and I both took out one of the slices of cheddar. The patties were cooked perfectly and were nice, thick, and juicy. They had a great sear and were seasoned well. The bun was nice and gooey, but were a little too big for the burger patty. The burgers also had a crazy thick slice of tomato. The lettuce was on the bottom of the burger, which did a good job of catching the juice from the patty and keeping it in the burger = very good burger construction. What struck us most was how well balanced this burger was. All the flavors really worked well together.  III. The tots The tots were good. They were well fried and had a nice spice to them. They had lots of herbs!  IV. Miscellaneous This place is in downtown Las Vegas so parking can be a bit tricky. It's really cute inside and has a great vibe. We had to wait for a table, but they have this cool courtyard out back that has a firepit and lots of seating to make waiting comfortable. The drinks were really good. My daaaaaaaaaammmmn, Daniel! was particularly refreshing! Caleigh, our waitress was really great. She was funny, attentive, and just wonderful. She explained to us that they encourage sharing here and that all food comes out when it's ready.   V. Value The value is pretty average for this type of burger. It's more of a gourmet burger and the price matches the taste and quality of ingredients.  VI. The verdict We really enjoyed this burger despite being incredible full (some of us had a buffet earlier and we all ate at Heart Attack Grill only 15 minutes before). That really says something about the quality of this burger. The ratings: 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4.  Next burger crew meeting: May 21, 2016 @ 10:30am at Mon Ami Gabi. Vegas, baby!",

You may find a seat at the bar but don't count on it.  The patio out back is lovely but the summer heat doesn't make it so appealing, but the most recent time I was there...I didn't mind the heat because the set up is so \"clean\" that it didn't away from the feel of the place.   The servers wear rock band tshirts but all Pop bands from the 60s onward....I think I remember Beastie Boys, but that's an interesting twist.    The bill comes in some beatnik style book that people sign like its a bead and breakfast \"been here\" book.   The food is so good but it's heart attack food.  Bacon jam and bacon ice cream which is amazing is obviously not what the healthy Vegans are ordering and it's got a Tapas style serving feel which is may in fact be a Tapas restaurant and I just don't know.    Downtown is coming back.....if it was hip...and Carson Kitchen is the best restaurant down there as far as amazing food and ambiance.  Health wise...no way, but that's why you eat out.  Enjoy!!",

But I will be fair.  I have plenty of friends whom I know will enjoy this type of place.  I know this is just due to personal preference.  So 4 stars, is that fair?",

    "text": "I ordered the Wellington Empanada and found it to be quite interesting.  It had a light and flaky crust that did not disappoint.  I thought that the beef inside was a little bit bland but that was remedied with the sauce that they pour on it.  I also got the short-rib sliders, which were decent, but the tater tots were very yummy.    The only drawback seems to be the super awkward seating arrangement inside, but one could say it is good because you can stir up more conversations by accidentally bumping into people and chairs.  Next time, I would definitely try to get a seat at the table that looks into the kitchen - but only on a day that is not sweltering.",

(not ON 6th street as the address might suggest)  ALLERGY FRIENDLY I have very severe allergies and we rarely eat out, but we were invited to Carson Kitchen with a group of 16 and it was important that I attend... so I emailed them in advance (as anyone with serious allergies should) and asked if accommodating my very abnormal allergies was possible. I offered to bring my own food or eat prior to the visit if it was an issue. They assured me that they could accommodate my allergies and prevent from calling attention to the issues during the meal. Emails back and forth followed and they worked closely with me in making sure all ingredients were safe for me. When I arrived early to the restaurant I introduced myself and the staff reassured me that all was set. Everything went perfectly and they were discrete and amazing. THANKS!!!",

In the mood for a burger, I had the butter burger, which is a very simple and pretty-looking burger with a thick slice of tomato, slices of unmelted cheese, and one lettuce leaf. The buns are nicely toasted. It's a very instagram-friendly meal. The tater tots were topped with some kind of seasoning and were really good. Rather pricey for a burger though - $14.",

    "text": "Carson Kitchen is a welcome addition to downtown Las Vegas.   (Rating = 3.5 ) First the food - I came for lunch and due to the price point and the fact that my stomach is often smaller than my brain thinks it is, I decided to try the two most commonly mentioned appetizers instead of entrees.  I ordered the bacon jam/brie with toast and the crispy chicken skins.  The bacon jam/brie is good.  It didn't knock my socks off but I admit there was something addictive about it and I couldn't stop eating it either. I wish there was more brie (just a small puddle in the middle of the jam was all I could see) and I wish the jam was just a bit less sweet and more smokey more brie would definitely improve this dish.  I would rate it a 4 out of 5 except the toast too dry and toasted for my preference creating too crunchy of a surface that didn't absorb any of the jam. so 3.5 Price 14.00  The Crispy Chicken Skins is a decadent fried treat accompanied by a honey dipping sauce.  The skins themselves are delicately fried so that the coating doesn't overpower the taste of the skin.  Dipped in the honey they were very good.  Dipped in the bacon jam made them even better as the taste of the skin Noneified some of the sweetness of the jam and the bacon flavor went very well with the light saltiness of the skin.  4 out of 5. Price 5.00    Price point - The meal above plus an iced tea cost me $22.00 for lunch and to be honest with you the value simply wasn't there.   Even for downtown and especially for the location.  I don't feel like I received $19.00 in food quantity combined with quality.   The bacon jam was the culprit costing more than most of the sandwiches. I felt the price of the chicken skins was reasonable. 3 stars  Note: The below is for info only and did not change my score.  The ambiance is that of a busy bar. The dining area is small with several community sized tables and the setup is clearly intended to foster socializing with tablemates/bar mates. There appears to be 2 bars with seating and a handful of tables.  There is an upstairs that is open on the roof however it won't open for lunch until September or October when it is cooler.  The tables are very close together and it is difficult to move about without bumping a chair or a server scurrying to keep up with the crowd.  The location is in the recently reclaimed hotel on Carson/6th right behind the post office.  There is zero signage on Carson street to let you know they are a restaurant or even open and the windows are tinted so you can't see until you get very close.  The service at the bar was great and the bartender very friendly and informative.  The check comes in a book which has signatures and notes from other patrons written in the book, an interesting touch.    I didn't get a direct interaction with the waitstaff but observing them they all seemed very attentive to their tables and seemed to be processing food and orders quickly.    There were a few other menu items that look good and I will be back, hopefully able to move the score up a bit.  The bread pudding looked delicious.",

Their urban vibe, fantastic servers (thank you Bianca) and fantastic management make this place one of my top picks in Vegas.  We come to Vegas at least twice a year and have eaten at MANY of the high end restaurants on the strip and there are few that compare to the creative dining genius of Carson Kitchen!!!    The fried chicken skins are a must along with the bacon jam.  I will be dreaming of both of these for months to come.  We also had the Cheesesteak pierogis and they were to die for.  My husband had the lamb chops and he was in heaven.  This was a fantastic experience and I recommend everyone check out this gem!!!",

Followed it up with the bacon jam, spicy boiling goodness spread on soft buttered slices of baguette.

If we pass through Vegas again will for sure make another stop at this place! A winner for sure!!",

The smoked honey for dipping the skins in is perfect.   The lamb tacos were just ok. The flour tortilla tastes raw and dry. They could use some sort of treatment. The ground lamb was also kinda dry. Together, I would pass on the tacos. Highly recommend sitting at the open kitchen bar and watch the masters at work. Superb service through the whole meal. What a gem.",

The dishes our group got were: fried green beans, burnt ends, fried chicken skins, bacon jam (which we didn't actually order but ate and paid for anyway because we didn't want to make too much of a stink), sea bass, shrimp and grits, and oxtail risotto. Almost every single dish was a salt overload and the bacon jam had a really weird texture and odd taste. They ran out of water glasses, so the guys at our table went almost a half hour without water. Burnt ends were more fatty and not very crispy, but the sauce was yummy. The fish was the best thing and was delicious. I only ate about 5 bites of the risotto because it was so salty, my boyfriend said it was a struggle to get through the shrimp and grits for the same reason. Trendy and cute place, but our group expected more given the reviews.",

I can't wait to return and try more of the menu, especially the desserts! What a great addition this is to downtown!",

Normally rabbit is very fatty, but shredding it makes it very balanced.  Oxtail was unusual and extremely good.  Again oxtail is very flavorful but on the fatty side, so shredding makes it balance and complements the risotto that goes with it.",

The watermelon feta salad was delicious as were the black rice/oxtail risotto and chicken thighs/citrus chimichurri. We finished it all off with glazed donut bread pudding. We were thoroughly satiated and very impressed by the great service from the staff all around. Highly recommend you try this place if you visit downtown Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Carson Kitchen is a good night out. It had a great menu of interesting and flavorful new American foods so it was a lot more exciting than eating at your regular old vegas buffet. We came in around 7pm and the wait was 30 minutes and they offered to put us up in the shared patio to wait but since it's just a block off of Fremont st and Container Park, it was a nice opportunity to walk around. We came back with time to spare so checked out the patio and it was okay. Glad we got a seat inside because it was 100 degrees. We ordered the crispy chicken skin and rainbow cauliflower to start, turkey burger and trout for our entrees, and the banoffee pie for dessert. The things I would recommend were the caulliflower, turkey burger (it comes with tater tots that are pretty good), and banoffee pie (it comes in a little jar). The chicken skin was a little overdone, though it was a nice crunch to add to the fish. The fish portion was just too small, though well cooked. I really like the turkey burger, which was well-seasoned, and the banoffee had so much delicious graham cracker crust it was the best thing we ate there. The waitress was okay. She was the type of waitress that would say a dish was her favorite thing in the world simply because you pointed it out. Then we saw her say something similar about another dish to a nearby customer. She made the mistake of giving us one glass of water and saying that there were no clean water glasses, which didn't make any sense since we could see several behind the bar. We were parched, it was 100 degrees outside, and asked another waiter for a glass. He obliged our basic human needs. Bill was about $45.00 for two.",

It is in the Carson hotel, which has many outlets around it's edge. It is the last place, 100 is on the door. It is a pretty low key place, every one is friendly l, Stacy served us, she was great. We had Deviled Eggs which were very good. With caviar and Italian ham on top. Very tasty! It was followed by Bacon Jam, Which is now one of my favorite bread spreads! Pile it on, you will run out of bread before you run out of spread. It was out of this world good. Next came the mushroom flat bread. It was very nice. You could taste the mushrooms earthy-ness as well as the tart cheese. Then we had the bread pudding it was also way over the top. I can't say enough about this place.

    "text": "THE PROS: Gyro Tacos. Wow! Really good cheese burger. Tasty lemonade.   THE CONS: No on the Mac & Cheese. Ouch...major lactose tummy ache after eating that.   No on the meatballs (IKEA meatballs taste better)  No on the Bacon Jam (too spicy) and the bacon was too hard. Not melt in your mouth bacon but rather the kind you have to spit out because it's over cooked.   Restaurant is located towards the area of town I consider a bit seedy. Meter parking only, which can be a pain.  Staff here is stoic (no warmth or friendliness here).   Summary: I'm glad we finally tried the place so I could see what all the hoopla was about...but would I go back? Nah. $70 for a half good / half blah lunch doesn't seem to be a good value. My friends and I give Carson Kichen (with this price point to value ratio) 3.75 stars.",

Was looking to grab some lunch and remembered seeing this place the day before while having a doughnut next door (I'm talking to you O Face) so thought I'd give it a try. Sat at the bar and had a microbrew root beer while looking over the menu (too early for me to start on the \"non-root\"  beer!) The staff was friendly and when I asked for a recommendation that I could sink my teeth into they offered up the NY Strip Steak. I was looking for some comfort food as as a \"side-dish\" so I also ordered the Baked Mac & Cheese.  You ever have a meal that after the first bite you get sad because it's so good and you realize that at some point it's going to be all gone? This was one of those meals! I enjoyed and savored every bite because I knew at some point my food would be all gone and and I'd have to come back down to reality!  The only downside was it would be nice if the steak came with a side. I was by myself so it cost more than I was planning to spend on lunch. Recommend going with a few people so that you can order and split a few entrees and social dishes.",

    "text": "This past Sunday evening my husband and I decided to take his parents here after we had a great experience a few months ago; that was an HUGE mistake and embarrassment.  We called to make a reservation around 6:30 and were told they don't take them for less than 6 people but, if we were headed there soon it wouldn't be a problem as they weren't busy. The lady told us to just call when we got close and they'd make sure there was a table available. We immediately hopped in the car and called as instructed only to be told there was now an hour wait. What??? She indicated to still come and it shouldn't really be that long.  We arrived, gave our name and waited in their back yard. As we waited and waited, we witnessed a hostess seat a party of 4 that did not have all of their diners with them but, she told them that was fine. What?? Since we had our entire very hungry party ready, my husband went to ask the hostess what was up with that. She did agree that all members of the party need to be present before seated but, did not ask the 2 men to wait back outside until everyone arrived. Instead she told us it shouldn't be much longer. Frustrated, we waited some more (about a total of an hour) until finally being seated on their wobbly little stools.  The food was good, the waitress was nice but, the real kicker was when the bill came. I normally quickly look at a bill and pay it but, this time I noticed my husband's soda water was $12 (we were charged every time she refilled it), 2 orders of tiny tacos were over $30 and even more insulting a charge for more tiny pieces of toast (more=maybe 4 slices).   I called over the waitress to ask about primarily the ridiculous amount for soda water and she at that time told us it's because it's from a bottle. What? We weren't told it was a bottle when we ordered it nor did a bottle come to the table like my father-in-law's coke. She said she'd ask her manager about adjusting it. A male manager came over that was strangely confrontational and beyond rude for such a situation, explained the whole bottle thing and would be able to take 2 of the charges off (there were 4 total). I told him that was unacceptable as we were never told we were ordering a bottle to begin with much less each time the waitress automatically refilled it. I also informed him that our experience had started off horrible, that we are locals entertaining our parents. **This is also the time I signaled our parents to leave** He seemed to be deaf to our concerns as his demeanor never changed and no apologies were given. He told us \"fine but, you'll still have to pay for one\".   Now Folks, you may be asking \"B**ching about soda water? Really?\" Yes, because I have ZERO tolerance for liars and scammers (even here in Vegas)!  Due to his lack of customer service as a manager, he could care less about us nor our horrible experience. He adjusted the bill and came back silent. NEVER EVER apologizing. However, I did hear him ask the table behind us if everything was ok and if they needed anything.  This place is a complete joke. It belongs on The Strip where they can get away with overcharging and nickeling and diming guests or at the very least rethink their business practice that currently has a total lack of customer care.",

I was able to experience this restaurant with some of my gf's on First Friday. First of all, it's a cute and chic place located downtown on 6th and Carson. They only take reservations if you have a large party. When we got there at 8PM, they said it would be a 2 hour wait for a party of 3. They don't have those little gadgets that buzz when your table is ready, but they take your phone # and call you when the table is ready.  Ok, time to get to the good stuff. The food here is DELICIOUS and amazing! It's definitely set up so you can share the plates (tapas like) with your party. This evening we ordered:  * Bacon Jam o Bacon + Jam + Brie + Bread o This is a must and also works as a dessert  * Baked Mac & Cheese o top 3 Mac & Cheese's I've had in LV * Rainbow Cauliflower o Has lime juice and garlic on it, the top is delicious but the bottom got really soggy and was too acidic (lime juice)  * Young Beets Salad o Personally not one of my favorites, (the beets tasted like they were canned) but one of my friends favs  * and a shrimp appetizer o AMAZING! they were prepared with tempura and had a hint of spice As far as cocktails, my gf's had the \"get shorty!\" and enjoyed it, I had a glass of the Grenache but wouldn't really recommend their wine.   Service was your average from the hostess to the server, the manager or supervisor was the one that was bringing out our food as soon as it was out.   So for food 5 Stars but Service I would say 4 Stars!  I'm looking forward to going back and maybe celebrating some small milestones there!  Hope this helps!!",

Good eats that are family style, a small bar with great options and a full view of the kitchen. The prices were reasonable and the service was good. It's a great place to take a date or to take a small group of friends. Lighting is darker, it's located near Fremont so you can always find something entertaining to do after. Try the cauliflower dish (not my normal go to dish but it was damn good).",

Honestly... you only have to try one thing here and it will just keep you coming back for more... and that's bacon jam. The flavor will linger on your taste buds no matter how long it has been, and it will have you yearning for your next visit to this place. It's like crack in a cast iron.   I stick to my usuals because they never let me down -macaroni and cheese -bacon jam -rainbow cauliflower  -chicken skins -ny cocoa steak -strawberry cheesecake (insanely good)  I've probably tried one of everything on the menu and it's all good!

I think maybe others really like the new combination of flavors, but I just want good food, prepared right. I think making great french fries is a mark of a great restaurant. They're not easy to make. They weren't great here.  Butter burger wasn't fabulous. It's was just a burger. I thought the salads were a bit small. Definitely wasn't a fan of the lamb gyros.

I do have to stress the word little, as there is not a ton of seating inside the restaurant, but they also have a very hip outdoor area where you can enjoy a cocktail or two.  The entire place is open so you can watch the kitchen operate from just about any seat in the restaurant.    The cocktail list is fun and interesting.  The purple haze and town's end were both terrific cocktails.  The food really shined here and the small plate approach makes trying lots of dishes possible.  I would say a group of 3 or 4 would be perfect here. We had the deviled eggs, fried green beans and bacon jam as our appetizers.  The deviled eggs and fried beans were spot on. The bacon jam tasted a little burnt but was still highly edible.  We then moved on to the rabbit ragu and oxtail risotto, both of which are worth going back for.  We were really too full for dessert but decided to try the day old donut bread pudding anyways.  Yeah, we ate the whole thing!!!  Save room for that.  All in all, great food, great drink and top it off with great, fast service...  Winner in my book.  I will be back.",

The donut bread pudding was slightly disappointing and the fried chicken sandwich and burger we're both pretty good (but not phenomenal.)  The reason why I'm taking off two stars is because the manager was rude. We called ahead to see the wait time and they said they could put our name on the wait list for a table and I told them we'd be there in an hour. There was a terrible accident blocking streets around the restaurant so I called to tell them we would be 10 mins late. They said that was perfectly fine.   When we arrived the manager chastised me and told me I can only call 15 mins ahead. I apologized and he continued on about how rude that was literally rolling his eyes as we talked. Then he dismissed us and said he we would have to wait 30 minutes. There were open tables sitting there and they wouldn't seat us. Finally I asked the waitress (who was very sweet) if we could be seated (after waiting for 30 mins) and the manager came over, acted like he was doing a us a favor and said he'd make an exception and seat us. What a power tripping rude manager.",

We had  some really good dishes - my favorite was the crispy chicken skin (I'd literally return for this alone) along with the tempura green beans. The brussel sprout caesar salad was pretty good as well. The pork belly was just ok - a bit fattier and not as flavorful as I would have liked. The devil egg was fine (I'm not a fan of deviled eggs in general, so I can admit bias w this one) - my wife really likes deviled eggs, and thought this was a winner. The black rice oxtail risotto was too salty - likely the result of too much parmesan cheese (my wife had been here previously and loved the dish on that occasion, but did not this time. we spoke w the waiter and manager who suggested the oversalt was from parmesan). The brownie was a winner, and I love the bacon ice cream that accompanied it. Overall, we had a really good meal, the black rice oxtail risotto was taken off the bill. So they made it right, immediately. We will definitely be back.",

They have a neat courtyard in back of the restaurant that's nice to sit in while waiting.  We were really lucky being seated at the 2 corner seats at the counter because we really got to see how a well run restaurant functions.  We watched as the manager called orders to the kitchen and as he expedited all the food that was coming out.  He set up all the plates with whatever accompaniments were needed for the each dish and the second the food was ready, it was put on the plates and he quickly had a server deliver them to the tables.  If there was no server available right then, he'd deliver them himself.  ALL the food hit the tables piping hot, just how it should be.  With this being said, my favorite things we ordered were the Tempura green beans with chili-pepper jelly cream cheese, and the Crispy fried chicken skins with smoked honey.  The time elapsed between the time they left the fryer to the time they were in front of our drooling lips was at the most 30 seconds.  They both were piping hot, crispy, perfectly seasoned, and delicious as hell.  The other 2 dishes we ordered were the Pecan crusted lamb chops with a mint chimichurri and the Veal meatballs with sherry foie cream.  These were also good with the lamb being better...a perfect mid-rare and the minty chimichurri gave a nice hit to it. The meatballs were tasty as well but pretty standard as far as a good meatball goes so that was our least favorite of the 4 dishes.  Really good food, a lively hipsterish atmosphere, and efficient and friendly staff, this is definitely a place that I want to come back to.",

    "text": "Carson Kitchen gave me excellent food and service.  I found Carson Kitchen highly rated on Yelp and was staying a short walk away from the D hotel.  It was quite busy on a weeknight and I think I would not have gotten in if I weren't alone and willing to sit at the bar.  That turned out to be the best place to be, as the service and hospitality were outstanding.  After I insisted, the bartender selected and made me one of their menu cocktails, which was quite good and not something I was used to.  We got to talking, along with another patron and Carson Kitchen regular.  Expressing skepticism that their turkey burger could be edible, as it was, a turkey burger, a heated exchange ensued and a challenge was issued.  They got me to agree to order a Turkey burger, claiming it has won competitions with serious beef burgers around town.  First came the deviled eggs which, with caviar and bacon, were very good and went quickly.  At this point we were all friends at the bar and the eggs were shared - it was that kind of vibe.  The Turkey Burger:  Firstly, the tots.  Mmmmmm....  Oh how good - perfect tater tots with ketchup.  Nice color and crunch.  10/10  The burger was very good and I'm glad I ordered it.  It was not a good alternative to a beef burger (sorry) but can stand on its own a separate type of food entirely.  If you strongly desire a great beef burger - stay away!  If you just want something delicious, then seriously consider it.  The complexity of flavors was very well done and the overall result had me clean my plate.  What a pleasure to sit at the bar with Felicia and her loyal patrons for a delicious meal.  Also thanks for the samples, barman with nice hair.  Be warned they close early for Vegas and they will run out of popular dishes, so go early.",

It's a must try if you are in the old Vegas area!   From the outside, it's extremely lowkey. You have to know it's there to happen upon it. Luckily, we knew exactly where we wanted to go. The inside is incredible. The tables, chairs, lights, etc are beautiful. It looks like it is straight out of an interior design magazine. I was absolutely blown away by it. It's also entirely open from the bar to the dining room to the kitchen. It's very small, yet quaint and cozy.   The staff is spot on. The hostess was extremely nice to us and worked us in where she could since it was pretty much totally booked. Our waiter was also great. He went over the menu and gave great recommendations. I loved the entirety of the staff. It seemed like they were all best friends, and I would love to hang out with them.   The food was AMAZING. It's all tapas serving style, so get several plates and share it all! We got a ton of different dishes, and I will give a brief report on each of them.   The young beets has beets (two kinds), grapes, and goat cheese. I love the goat cheese, and the beets were really tasty!  The veal meatballs were also very good. They were spicy, but also had a sweet taste. They were perfectly cooked, not too dry.  The crispy chicken skin was a great way to start. They taste like really light fried chicken and they come with a honey dipping sauce.   The pig and fig flat bread was not what I expected. It's like a pizza with fig paste sauce, pork two ways, and arugula. It was both sweet and savory, perfectly balanced!   The baked Mac and cheese was INCREDIBLE. It was extra cheesy and creamy. I have no doubt it was the best Mac and cheese I have ever had. Wow.   The real star of the show was the glazed donut bread pudding. This is by far the best dessert I've ever had in my life. It was so sweet, milky, and caramelized. It literally melted in your mouth and left you wanting more and more. I may have shed a few tears eating it.   Everything was presented in a very cool way. The unique bowls and boards were such a nice touch. Our check even came stuck into the pages of a book. I loved everything about my experience here.",

Most chairs don't have backs and got uncomfortable really quickly! 7 of us went yesterday afternoon and were sat at a table that was barely large enough for 6. We got there about 4pm (between lunch and dinner) so it was pretty empty.  We asked to combine a 2 person table with ours and hostess said no. We said we may consider eating elsewhere if we couldn't and she said, \"ok, let me know if you decide to stay\". A friend really wanted to eat there, so we stayed. Waiter actually told us we look like we 'got in trouble and all had to sit at this tiny table' and moved us to a much larger high top (where we shared with another group... but that was ok with us). Hostess was rude and didn't care about our comfort-or whether we stayed or not. Horrific greeting and start.",

Plenty of room along the curbside.   The Bar was also nice.  The feeling in there was a little lonely.. The lights were dim, and the bar was rather quiet.   I ordered the Chicken Skins and a Cuban Sandwich. Initially I wanted to order a Burger, and the Famous Chicken Skins.  When my food came I was disappointed with the Cuban Sandwich. But the Chicken Skins and Drinks made up for it all.     Great Customer Service.. And if I was Hungry I wouldn't mind going again.. Only this time I'd order a Burger AND my Chicken Skins.",

    "text": "This was our second trip to Carson Kitchen in the desert.  We enjoyed it so much the first time, we came back with friends.   Located in an odd location in the Fremont area, don't blink, you will probably drive right passed.  Street parking near by is metered, so be sure to pay enough time so you're not interrupted meter feeding half way thru your meal.    Restaurant was remodeled and expanded since our last visit.  Looks like they blew out the wall to extend the bar.  Funky modern vibe, lots of plaid and \"a lot more ink, a little less sleeve\" atmosphere.   The kitchen is open so you can see the chefs working their magic first hand.  As in any good chef's kitchen, noise was minimal.  No pots and pans banging about.  We felt the best way to experience Carson was to order a lot of appetizer bites for the entire table to share.   We ordered the bacon jam that's absolutely to die for yummy!  The Devil's eggs were good, but honesty....every picnic I've ever been to has their own rendition.  Theirs happened to be topped with caviar.   The veal meatballs with peas were outstanding!  Hard to have just one!  Melt in your mouth delicious.   Portions were good sized and enough for a table of 4 to share.    One of us ordered the Secret Sunday Chicken sandwich.  Tender juicy chicken on an aioli smeared brioche bun.  Another at the table - dear Lord was on a diet in Vegas - ordered a Green Goddess Caesar salad.    We all waited and salivated for dessert.   The Glazed Donut Bread pudding sounds heavy....but it's really a light treat. Caramel and rum covers a light fluffy donut.  Just enough to share with the table and get a few bites to satisfy you.  We liked it so much we nearly licked the bowl clean!  The Bourbon Fudge Brownie was outstanding!  Super rich dense chocolate flavor topped with ice cream and bacon bits.  Out of this world.   The desserts were by far the stars of our dining experience.    The check arrived along with an \"autograph book\" of reviews.  Sign your name and share your comments of your favorite meal.  A nice inclusive touch to an exceptional and well presented meal.  Service was good and staff friendly.  We enjoyed Carson Kitchen once again, as did our friends.",

Every cocktail is super balanced and because I went at lunch, the bartender could talk to me and gave me several recommendations to go to during my stay.   The food is also great. I just got a flatbread with lox and onions and flavored cream cheese. They change their menu four times a year, probably because they offer a lot of farm to table options. Definitely come for the cocktails and come at lunch to sit at the bar so you get attention! It's crowded in the dining space because it's so good.",

A good variety to suit any mood but not large so you're not standing there and reading a menu for 10 minutes debating the merits between drinks that all sound more or less the same anyway.  We were seated right in the ballpark estimated time at the counter in front of the kitchen.  Now, being a chef myself, I love this location but I will say that the seats were ever so slightly uncomfortable.  I don't think there was enough leg clearance for those of us with longer legs and I found myself with my feet all over my friends purse.    The food.  Yes, it's good.  Like, really really good.  They pace the items so that whatever is ready first will come first.  I like this but I was also kind of disappointed.  We ordered the chicken thighs which take 20-30 min.  This made us think that we'd get this dish last but we got some other things afterwards.  It made us think that maybe they forgot or maybe it wasn't put through.  The food is absolutely delicious though.  Everything we got was very tasty and full of flavor.  The black rice risotto with oxtail is my dream dish.  AMAZING!  This is definitely going to become a \"GO-TO\" place for me.",

    "text": "Came for dinner with friends based on great online reviews and the recommendation from a friend. Group dining is the way to go here, since the plates are perfect for sharing. Our server was amazing- made helpful recommendations about dishes to try, how much to order, cleared plates in a way that was efficient, but didn't make us feel like we were being rushed out the door. Definitely 5 star staff. The food was OK, but the menu didn't offer many vegetarian options, so probably not a place I would come back to, but everyone else seemed to like it.  We ordered a ton, probably a bit too much for a group of 7... - Deviled eggs- Four halves = $11. These were nice a creamy with a bit of space and some type of meat on top - Roasted beets- ($11) YUM! - Caesar salad- ($12) fine with a good dressing, but on the small side - Lamb tacos 3 small street-style size = $12, add one more for $4- I thought just OK, but you shouldn't take my word for it since I'm not a big lamb eater and definitely don't prefer ground meat - Baked mac and cheese ($12)- didn't really love this. It was nice and creamy, but wasn't very hot and had truffle oil that seemed too strong - Rainbow cauliflower- ($9)- I love cauliflower and am sad to say this is the first cauliflower dish I think I've ever ordered out and not enjoyed. I didn't care for the strong vinegar flavor - Wild mushroom flatbread ($14)- meh. The pickled onions were nice, but I didn't care for the tuffle oil  Other things that we ordered, I didn't try, but they seemed to be crowd pleasers with my dinner companions: - Bacon jam with brie ($13). Pro tip, save some to eat with the mac and cheese - Veal meatballs- ($14) - Pig & Fig flatbread- ($13) - Black Mussels- ($14) - Short rib grilled cheese with tater tots ($14) - NY strip($20)  Overall, would say service is great. Menu just not my style of food.",

    "text": "Another great trip to Carson Kitchen. The beet plate, oxtail risotto, and donut bread pudding continue to be the amazing classics that they have been since opening. Today I tried for the first time their Mac, shrimp app, and pecorino plum salad. The Mac is amazing, worth it (kind of wish I ordered the bbq thighs to pair it with). The shrimp app will be my new go-to here, it's a cross between Chinese take out honey walnut shrimp and nachos in the best way possible, amazing. The salad, though something that did not expect - I was hoping for something presented like the beet plate - was very fresh and flavorful (amazing date vin) but in my opinion portioned poorly for the 13 dollar price.    Past experiences: I've been coming here on and off for over two years and I've tried a lot of dishes some of which have stuck to the menu. Most importantly of which is the coffee rubbed strip, which is one of best pieces of steak in town, especially considering the price. If you're really hungry and don't mind something super rich I also recommend the bacon jam, it's unusual compared to other iterations I've had - note that it's huge, too much for two people in my opinion.   Also something that I've tried a lot of are all of the cocktails here, all of which are great. This is one of the best cocktail programs in town for sure.   I wholeheartedly suggest visiting here. Good food and great vibes, it's made to become your regular place for get togethers or just grabbing a drink and a bite.",

    "text": "Food and ambience are on point here.  When I arrived on a weeknight for dinner with three other people there was a thirty minute wait.  They told us we can grab a drink at the bar or can go wait in their backdoor patio.  We decided to grab a drink at the bar to go to their patio area.  The girl behind the bar originally ignored us for the longest time.  She was just wiping down glasses while we wait for her to acknowledge us.  Finally when I made it obvious she finally took our drink orders.  It was annoying.  Annoying to the point where I almost ask everything to leave.  Once we got our drinks, we chilled at their spectacular patio with a bon fire going.  It was nice.  Once we were called and seated, we asked for their short rib grilled cheese and bacon jam but both were sold out.  Boooooooo.  We wish the waitress told us prior to us ordering what they were out of.  So we went with the following and its description:  Veal Meatballs ($12)- These tender and flavorful small meatballs were divine.  They came out in a bowl with some sauce and peas all over them.  They were really good and perfect if you love veal.    Secret Sunday Chicken Burger ($13)- We got this as a replacement to the short rib grilled cheese sandwich which was out.  It was good but nothing crazy.  It was served with some fries.    Baked Mac & Cheese ($12)- This was the best thing we had there.  It was so good that we got two orders between the four of us.  It had a truffle taste and was super cheesy.  We all loved it and recommend it.   Braised Short Rib ($14)- This was suggested by our waitress since the bacon jam starter was out.  The short ribs were pretty magically, tender, and had lots of flavors.  It was a good starting dish.  It was served with two crust-less piece of white bread.   Rainbow Cauliflower ($9)- This was our least favorite here but still a goodie.  The cauliflower had lots of lemon but I enjoyed it.  They were cooked perfectly.    Galzed Donut Bread Pudding ($8)- OMG!  Now I know why the hype.  I don't know another place that has bread pudding as amazing as this place.  It was one bread pudding served in a bowl with the best sauce poured on top.  It was the perfect ending to our dinner.   All dishes are about $10-$20.  It's kinda tapas style and everything is shareable.  The service in the dining area was excellent.  The service at the bar sucked.  The inside is smaller so there is normally a wait.  I love the romantic ambience.  It is perfect for a date night or to hang with a small group of friends.",

    "text": "I have two words: BACON. JAM.  If you get nothing else on the menu, get the BACON JAM. Baked Brie, a toasted Baguette...truly, what more could you ask for? More Brie, actually, definitely more warm brie. They will gladly give you more toast slices, but they will charge you for them (they don't tell you this up front, but it's so good it's hard to care!)   I ordered the Coco-Espresso NY Strip as my main course. It was perfectly cooked and beautifully plated, but it doesn't come with anything else, and I did find that the price point was a little steep for a meat-only dish. However, after the Bacon Jam and Brie appetizer, I certainly didn't leave the restaurant \"hungry.\"  The atmosphere inside is really, pretty cool. Lower ceilings with a more \"Industrial\" feel. We ate dinner here before seeing the tour of \"Hamilton\" and it was the perfect combination of trendy and casual!   If you just want to try one of their awesome crafted cocktails, there's a little bar to the right of the entrance and even a patio outside and upstairs!   I definitely recommend getting a reservation (especially if you're aiming to be seated between 7pm-8pm) as the place is not that big and does fill up. There is also no real \"signage\" outside and even I struggled to find it! The restaurant faces Carson St (go figure) but is right next to the Donut Bar. I also love how, although this spot is just one block away from the Fremont craziness, sitting inside, you'd never know it!",

We have been back many times since and it never disappoints. My goal has been to try everything on the menu, little did I know the menu changes from time to time and I'm left in an endless quest to try everything this awesome little restaurant can make.  Staff is very friendly and attentive, food is always on point, can get pricey but totally worth it. Expect wait times, but also worth it.  Here's a list of things you must try:  1. Baked Mac & Cheese - it's ridiculous how good it is, not enough to share so order two 2. Watermelon Feta salad 3. Chicken Skins - best shared with the table 4. Secret Sunday Chicken - one of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had 5. Butter Burger 6. Tempura Green Bean - also a must every visit 7. Cocoa Espresso steak  8. Glazed Donut bread pudding  The Get Shorty is also a good drink to wash all this down with if you like tequila and your drinks to have a bit of spice.  There's so much more. Don't be afraid to get out of your comfort zone and Carson Kitchen will reward you.",

All of the dishes were very good, which is why we keep coming back for our favorites, like the Chicken Skins and the Devils Eggs (with lardons and caviar!). But I always check out the newest menu and find a few new favorites.  I was happy to see that the Brussel Sprouts Caesar Salad is still on the menu - I love this crunchy version of a Caesar.

Pig & Fig flatbread (I only wish there was more goat cheese on top!), and Sunday Chicken Sandwich (biggest, juiciest chunk of chicken breast I ever did eat!).

There were so many options on the menu, but being that we were only 2 people had to settle to sample only 4.    They will bring them out as they are ready and we started with the fried chicken skin, which lets's be honest, the reason why we eat fried chicken!  Next up the \"devil's\" eggs which were the creamiest mixed with pancetta and topped with caviar.  Next up the gyro tacos - which is served as three, but they asked if we'd like an extra so we got 2 each. Ground lamb is so delicious and this really is an great spin on a gyro and a taco.  Last, we ended with the bacon jam with a melted brie and a pile of bread.     Restaurant was not busy and service was good.  The hostess was very friendly and was helping get the food to the table and chatting with the customers.   Very happy with everything we ordered and will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu on the next vegas trip.",

    "text": "So I had to try this place out for myself since I had read many of the Yelp reviews. I decided to go for lunch and was pleasantly pleased that the location was right next to the Donut Bar, so I could try out both places. Score!  We were lucky to land a parking spot right in front of the these businesses. Parking is sparse in this area and if you aren't paying attention, you can drive right by.  We walked in and were promptly seated at the bar. I also noticed that there is bar that you can sit at and watch the chefs making your food. For lunch time the place was not busy at all. There were just a few folks gathered around the chefs bar and a few tables were filled. The space is pretty small and intimate. There is also a second level, so perhaps more people were seated upstairs. Our bartender Chris was really helpful and basically explained that their menu changes with each season. The current menu is for spring. He told us that it is better to choose a couple of different items on the menu since the idea is to share the food. We viewed the menu and started with chicken skins, bacon jam and shrimp dunderi. We anxiously awaited the arrival of our food. Well, let me say I made I huge mistake in ordering the chicken skins (I thought I read chicken wings). They were accompanied with a honey sauce which was tasty but the whole skin thing (Yikes) I was not into. Thank goodness the bacon jam made up for it. This dish had carmelized bacon with melted brie and most Yelpers had raved about it.  We spread this delicious combination on the small baguette's they provided and experienced melt in your mouth goodness!  Next came the shrimp dunderi which came with only with two prawns and a ricotta style pasta. This was flavored with limoncello and was delicious. I think they could have spared at least six prawns since the dish ran $14!! This brings my review down to three stars.  Since we were at work we could not imbibe any alcohol although Manny the other bartender did try to tempt us. We received great, personal service which was appreciated by two first time customers.  Unfortunately, time was ticking and we had to get back to work so we were not able to try anything else although there were some other items that looked interesting. I would like to go back and sit at the chef bar as I think it might make the experience more enjoyable.",

The dining is different than other restaurants because the menu is not large, and everything is a la cart, so it is meant for sharing among the people you eat with.  We ordered the rainbow cauliflower, and it was simple, yet really good. I specifically came for their mac and cheese, I saw on other yelp reviews on how good it is, and YES, this is by far the best mac and cheese I have ever tasted. I still dream about it everyday. But if you do not like truffle oil, then it's not for you. It's rich and flavorful, and it's one of their dishes that they are known for.   10/10 - will definitely be back and will try other items. If you are fond of different flavors together you will love this restaurant. Also, they put a twist on a lot of classic dishes.",

    "text": "You should come here if you have 2 of 2 things while you're in Vegas (you will need both):  1) Mobility- take a car and drive yourself here. My friend and I spent $30 on cab fare trying to get to downtown Las Vegas with the possibility of not catching a cab ride back because cabs are not plentiful in downtown.  2) Intestinal fortitude- downtown Las Vegas is not for the faint of heart. The crowd is...eclectic which is a rather nice adjective to use. There are a lot of drunk, aggressive people in the downtown area if you happen to take a peep into the downtown strip after dining at Carson Kitchen, beware. I'm usually alright, but I was slightly uncomfortable because it was out of my element.   With that said, Carson Kitchen was great. I had a great meal here. I hope it garners more press and popularity because what the staff is putting out is nothing short but amazing.  My friend and I ordered the following:  -crispy chicken skin with smoked honey: deep fried pieces of chicken skin, lightly sprinkled with a powdery chili and dipped into a smoked honey. This was a winning combination. The texture of the chicken skin was spot on- not too hard with the right amount of crisp. I really enjoyed this dish. I do wish that the skin pieces were slightly smaller, but overall, this was excellent.  -\"devil's eggs\": deviled eggs topped with pancetta and caviar. The addition of fried bits of pancetta was excellent. It really balanced the soft texture of the deviled egg by giving it an extra crunch. There were also generous heaps of caviar on each egg. Wonderful.  -cocoa expresso New York strip steak: medium rare steak topped with a red wine demi. The steak was flavorful, had the right amount of chew, and perfect to the palette. This was surprisingly so good. I do wish that they were more sparing with the red wine demi because the sauce really added another dimension to the steak. Great overall main dish.  We also ordered a side of the fingerling potatoes to pair with our steak. This was a great addition because the potatoes came generously heaped with garlic. It was a winning steak and potato combination.  It's only been recent that I have ventured outside of the strip in search of food, and if you have the willingness to do so, you can find find gems like Carson Kitchen hidden in Vegas. Do yourself a favor- if you are searching for one really great meal in Vegas, make your way off the strip and into Carson Kitchen. It's a good bang for your buck ($27 per person including all of the dishes), and it helps keep the food scene in Vegas alive.",

    "text": "Carson Kitchen was quite the experience. 4 of us were in town for March Madness and we went to Yelp of course to help us find a place to eat. Carson Kitchen looked like it would hit the spot. Even with a picky eater on our hands. I was a bit curious about this place as we rounded a rural street corner. Nothing very cute about this street. But to our surprise there it was. A Cute little restaurant window with the glowing ambiance inside, welcoming us to come in. As we walked through the door it was very small. I was worried. They said \"A 40 minute wait.\" As I thought to myself \"Where would we wait, and where are the other people waiting....?\" The hostess that seemed to read my mind said \"There is a Patio right outside this door and a roof top bar above us, you are more than welcome to grab a drink and a seat there if you would like.\" Did she say \"roof-top bar?\" That alone made this place even more exciting. We walked upstairs where we found lots of seating (unfortunately all full,) a long bar and bar top, and a list of craft cocktails, wines, and beers. The Bartender was very helpful. 2 of our friends got some very interesting cocktails, one which included egg-whites. I stuck to a trusty Pinot Grigio that the bartender recommended. We went down to the seating area, founds a couple of cute chairs, sat, drank, and chit chatted. And before we knew it our names were being called.   We sat at a cute little table next to the window looking out to the street. Our waitress explained that this was a family affair. Items are meant to be shared. So we did just that. We started off with the Bacon Jam with Toasted Baguettes (PRO TIP: Get the extra Baguettes for a dollar a head of time. You will need them) The Jam came out sizzling, sweet and tangy, gooey and so good. The Baguettes were not too crunchy, as to tear your mouth apart, and were warm. We also started with the Crispy Chicken Skin with a Smoked Honey dipping sauce. Skins were large, crispy, and also don't tear up your mouth. But the Smoked Honey.... I could put that sh*t on anything. I even kept the left over sauce, just in case.   For the Entree's we got the Co-co Espresso New York Strip, cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  The Beef Belly Sliders, Juicy and tender. I had never had Beef Belly, only Pork, but this was just as delicious. It came with 3 sliders. It was plenty to share. Along with Spicy Sweet Potato Tatar Totes. Not really very spicy but very yummy. Our picky eater got the Gyro Tacos. She had them to herself but said she loved every bit.   We then finished our meal with 2 desserts. The Bourbon Fudge Brownies with Brown Butter Bacon Ice Cream. I didn't eat too much of this, as it was very rich for my taste. The rest of the group found this to be very tasty but we all agreed we could not taste much bacon. And Lastly the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding with 3 Rum Carmel, Vanilla Ice Cream. This had the consistency of bread pudding with the exact taste of a glazed donut. It was so interesting. Not one bit of it was left. We almost licked the bowl.   This restaurants was one of the highlights of our 3 day trip. We really enjoyed our experience. The staff was really great. You could see them all working their tail off. The interior was rustic, yet modern. Very small, but we all enjoyed that fact. You get more attention from the staff and the kitchen has time to get every detail right. We look forward to our next trip to Vegas and coming back for more delicious creations by Carson Kitchen.",

The atmosphere is fantastic, the seats are comfortable, the customer service is top notch... and the food literally brought tears to my eyes. We ate until we could eat no more, and both of us had multiple drinks. We walked out for about $65-80 with tip. I fully expected the check to be over $100 and wouldn't have complained it is was.   My husband and I travel a lot and we don't tend to go to the same place more than once on a trip... but after our first experience here we just had to come back! The 2nd night was just as good as the first. The waitress remembered us and made us feel like regulars - which is rare when you are from out of town. The food and drinks were just as good as the night before, and the owner even came and chatted it up with us for about 10 minutes just because he liked us.   I have never felt so sad to leave a restaurant. It felt like we were leaving an old friend. I wish I could pick this place up and move it to Seattle.

    "text": "Let me first start off saying this place was AH-MAZING!!!!!! Came here two weeks ago for vacation!  The vibe in this place I would say is pretty hipster. Before I get into the nitty gritty of this place I would like to say that the hostess was rude. My boyfriend and I only thought she was rude to us but finding out later that she was pretty much rude to everyone that had entered the restaurant. Just for future reference don't just toss menus on the table and walk away if customers don't know where their going and you continue to ignore and talk to your co-workers.  Alright now down to the menu! Let me just say that you HAVE to get the fried chicken crisps! They're so crunchy and especially dipped in honey!!!  Next on the menu we got the bacon jam this was something that I thought was good but not amazing because the bacon jam has some spice to it and as you keep eating it feels as if the spice builds up!  Gyro Tacos were so good this helped even out the two heavy appetizers that we first got so it's a good touch to your meal!  Last but not least the Ox tail Risotto, the ox tail was tender and went so well with the risotto. But this was a bit too salty. If it was less salty this dish would've been perfect!   As for our attentive and sweet waiter Dakota, you were the biggest sweetheart to us and literally made sure we were doing great during our meal here. Literally please ask for him if you do come here to be your server! He's awesome!",

They don't take reservations for a party of 4 , apparently that's too small for them.  Perhaps if it was delivered differently I would have a different opinion.  Regardless, I still went because we planned to try with friends who have also never been. I also live in downtown so I am always curious of the culinary scene.   They take your name down, how many in your party, tell you the wait time, and then to come back. They don't take your number they don't call or they don't text. I found this frustrating. Something needs to be done about this.  After having to wander around down town and make many laps in this blazing heat, we finally were seated. I have to say 5 stars for the service from our waitress. Wish I could remember her name she was so nice and pleasant and very suggestive. We ordered many things as our appetites grew.  The deviled eggs with caviar is great, the gyro tacos ok. The fried chicken skin good , didn't care for the jam butter with bread. The turkey mango burger was sweet. The tarter tots were delicious. I would come back again when it's slow or if I have a large party enough for this restaurant to take my reservation.   Again, my only complaint I have is my experience about the whole reservation thing and no text or call back not even a buzzer.",

I can't wait to eat here again!!!",

He had absolutely zero complaints & that is UNHEARD of coming from him (he's a chef) LOL Any way - he wanted to leave because I didn't see too many vegan options for myself, but I insisted we stayed cause I thought this would be perfect for him, & I was certainly right! As for me, I got the rainbow cauliflower & tater tots cause I was really worried about disliking the other options (not that they have very many cause most of their dishes have dairy.) So this place is GREAT for vegetarians & carnivores but not so exciting for vegans. I'm just glad my bf finally left a restaurant happy for once!",

OMG we could not have had better seats.  It was amazing to watch the kitchen line work and see all the plates coming out.  The girl working the expo line was super friendly and told us about all the dishes.  The manager was very enthusiastic and asked us how everything was several times.  Our server was awesome.  The food was delicious.  The deviled eggs are a necessary order item.  We also had the meatballs, fried green beans, bacon jam, and it was all fantastic.  We ended with the bread pudding.  I am not a dessert person and I inhaled it.  Just an exceptional experience all around.  BTW the ambiance is so wonderful because you can tell it is a locals place.  Not touristy at all, which was refreshing.  150% recommend.",

    "text": "I've had Carson Kitchen on my bookmark page for the last couple years and I'm so so so happy I finally was able to experience it.  Located right next to Downtown Fremont, this is a must stop from now on if I'm coming downtown.    1.  Everything on the menu is under $20, including the NY Strip which was cooked perfectly.  2.  Ambience level 1000.  The dining area is small, but with chairs lined around the kitchen and bar it works really well.   Small open room where you can see everything going on.  Very hipster atmosphere, I loved sipping on my Towns End near fire pit out back while we waited for our table.  3.  All of the food we sampled was amazing.  The restaurant encourages family style dining, so we ordered several things off the menu and let the entire table sample a little of everything.  Definitely the way to go here.    4.  Extremely well mixed and delicious cocktail creations.  The cocktails are a bit pricey at $10-$13 but worth it.  Everything I tried was really refreshing and tasted amazing, really can't wait to come back and try everything I didn't have on my first visit.   A couple of the highlights for me were the Fried Chicken Skins and Honey, the perfect balance of sweet and salty.  I was really impressed by the Fish Fillet sandwich also, so goooood!!   If you're looking for something delicious with a really cool atmosphere that will not break the bank, you should definitely come check out Carson Kitchen I can't wait to come back.",

I didn't want anything because of it, but mentioned it to the manager AND the waiter, as they both were at the table asking about our experience when it happened.  Neither responded, except for asking if I was done with the plate.  Plus, we waited 45 minutes for a table , while there was two 'reserved' tables. Neither was occupied when we left 1 1/2 hours later. It is a small, cozy place, but they kept saying we couldn't sit at the tables for 4 when we only had three people in our party. The ironic thing was we were seated eventually seated on a table for 6.   I'll probably return, but I'll not go on weekends or holidays. Maybe it's the extra pressure, or something, but I might go back again weekdays.",

He even took some time to chat with us. Watching the three chefs work together was enough to keep me in my seat all night. Talk about a well-oiled machine!   Our food was pretty good, but the theme was that it was all a little spicy (which is usually not an issue for me). Since we got to watch them make things up close and personal, we noticed either paprika or cayenne as a frequent addition, and we tasted it, too. The best thing we ate was the short rib grilled cheese, which was absolutely delicious and buttery. We also split the bacon jam (the spicy element here was in the liquid base), which came with lots of bread for dipping, but probably less brie than I was expecting. We also got the rainbow cauliflower.  They have a lovely back patio that was nice to relax on while we were waiting for a table. The staff was super pleasant, and the prices were perfectly reasonable. The food came out tapas style (and quickly). I'm glad we came here if for no other reason than our awesome view!",

    "text": "A good place to come eat and chat with friends. We came with empty stomachs on a Monday afternoon around 4-5 on Labor Day to try the place we have seen so many reviews about. We were seated right away and were attended to promptly. Service was good but the portions were very small compared to the price we paid and some of the stuff was a bit salty but the flavor was good.   We ordered:  Tempura Green Beans: This was the absolute surprise of the day. Tempura green beans are exactly how they sound but the pepper jelly cream cheese they served it with was so good!. The creaminess of the cheese with the sweetness of the pepper jelly complimented the mild flavor of the green beans. Although a bit oily for me, it was nevertheless, my favorite dish. Good portion  Cocoa- Expresso crusted Steak- It was very salty in my opinion. The crust itself was very salty on the end pieces but for the middle slices, it worked well. The meat was good. I would have preferred it a bit more rare but it was good the way they served it.   Rabbit Ragu- This was very good. The rabbit was cooked well with crunchy pieces of pancetta? or was it rabbit? Either way, the sauce worked well with the meat and complimented the spaghetti squash. Portion was super small in my opinion for the $12? $14 dollars I paid. If i really crave it, i would order it again but I think I'll opt for something else next time.   Hawaiian Flat Bread- Flatbread served with spiced rum pineapple and ham, sprinkled with chives. It was alright. The pineapple was delicious. It was a very bold and sweet flavor. The ham however, was salty and overpowered the pineapple which was a shame. Also a bit pricey but it's Vegas so I can't say anything there.   Overall it was a good experience. Good food although a bit salty and great customer service. Will be back to try other food on the menu!",

Last time were here meeting friends a month ago it was like a 45 minute wait time.  So wasn't too happy and expecting the same...We were having a way early dinner so no long wait time (530pm)...yeeessss! 10minutes tops wait in back patio. Upstairs wasn't open yet.   The steak was pretty bomb.  I thought it was gonna be a little thin cheap cut of meat.  It was rather delicious, medium rare to perfection and comes precut for sharing ( as all the dishes do )  The green bean dish was also pretty tasty and a different spin than the norm with light thin breading that flakes off.  Comes with a side of bell pepperish cheese thing for dipping.  The mushroom and spinach pizza was awesome...even threw a few pieces of the steak on top...yummmm...carnivore style! If my girl who is usually a 2 bites and box it for home girl...actually finished it and no leftovers...well then it's pretty darn good.   THE BAD. Wait times can be ridiculous... seriously finding parking then having to do alternative plans when you get their with friends is a downer.   The beet salad was tasty but it was wee size.  I think maybe the portion size should be rethought by the kitchen.  Loved that delicious little nugget of cheese deliciousness that it comes with.    P.s.  All in all a great early dinner and ambiance..  I think their was about 36 people in the 40 room dining space.  So pretty packed for that time but no serious wait times from the kitchen bringing food out.  Great job to the Carson Cocina! =)",

    "text": "My wife and I just tried this spot on a rare rainy Friday night here in Vegas. Because of the rain we had to sit inside, which is fairly small but well laid out. It's also mostly communal seating, which I'm not a fan of, but the tables are wide enough that you aren't shoved up in someone else's face. Unfortunately, the tables only have about 6\" of overhang and are completely solid underneath, which is a bit uncomfortable when you're over 6' tall.  The food is great and the prices are reasonable for what you get. We started with the crispy chicken skins, which were expectedly amazing. I mean, come on! All our lives we're told not to eat the skin (which we all know is the best part) because it's \"not healthy\".  Well here, they give you a whole bowl of just that with a side of smoked honey. It's fantastic.   Then we got the Bacon Jam, which is arguably what made us want to eat here in the first place. My wife absolutely loved it, but shockingly, I wasn't overwhelmed by it for some reason. It's a sizzling cast iron plate of bacon and brie cheese, how could I not love that?!? Oh well, that's a mystery for another time.  Next we shared the Jerk Turkey Burger, which was back to amazing, for both of us this time. It's flavorful, juicy, tender and just spicy enough. The burger came with a side of spicy tater tots which were delicious also.   Finally we shared the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding. This was decidedly mediocre for both of us. Just a big, doughy, plop of undercooked cake soaked in butter and caramel. Sounds like it would be great but it had next to no flavor.   For drinks we both had \"Drinks With the Mrs\" which were excellent. Refreshing but just strong enough.   Overall, it's a solid 4 stars and we'd definitely come again to try some more of the menu.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about this place, but the good outweigh the bad, so I definitely recommend anyone to try it.  The first time I went here was for dinner.  I got the rabbit ragu and my husband got the oxtail risotto.  Both were absolutely delicious, but very small portions.  Now, the prices were $12 and $14, respectively, which I thought were a little steep for the amount of food that came with it.  A friend of ours got the beet salad ($8) and I was again shocked at the small portion size.  We also had a few cocktails ($12 each) which were good, but again a small pour for the price.  I also remember it being extremely LOUD in there because of the design/layout/building materials.  Our waiter had to lean in and ask us multiple times what we had said and I felt like I was shouting at him.  So my first impression was: very good food, but kinda expensive for what you get.  Second time we came for lunch.  I got the fried green tomato sandwich which comes with tater tots.  My husband got the gyro tacos.  Then we shared the bread pudding for dessert.  The sandwiches and sharing plate prices are much more on point with serving size.  The fried green tomato sandwich was really quite scrumptious and had this nice crab ravigote on it.  The sandwich plus tots was $10.  Cheaper than the entrees, with more substance!  The gyro tacos came with three to the order,  and were also $10.  The tacos were mucho spicy, beware!  Also, my husband got a craft beer in a bottle for only like $5.  In conclusion, I like this place for lunch type food and beer.  Dinner food and the cocktails are just a little too expensive for me.  Whatever you get will be delicious.  AND I also just found out they have a rooftop patio which will be delightful!",

The set up is cool... small 2 and 4 tops around the perimeter and larger snaking tables that move into the bar hat are more \"family style\" which was cool, all 4 of us (me and the hubs + the two other people) were at the family style table and struck up some convo.   on to the food We had the crispy chicken skin, the italian sausage flatbread and the risotto.   Now the hubs mistakenly ordered the skins thinking it would be a chicken finger-esque type thing.  They were spiced, not too salty and served with a dish of honey.  After eating the first i wasn't too sure, but they grew on me... sweet and savory, I would get it again.   I had the flatbread, yummy, decent size... I recall it being called \"spicy Italian sausage flatbread\" without mention of the broccoli that was on it.  Very... Different... I tied it.. and ended up picking any of the larger pieces off.   Hubbs had the risotto... Ox tail risotto.  Now being italian to me risotto is strictly made with arborio rice.  The end.  This was made with like a black wild rice... It had a bit more of  a bite than I would like, and that wild rice flavor... but was decent.  I would not get that again, but I know I'm very  picky when it comes to italian foods.    Being monday afternoon I wasn't trying to get hammered, but did have the only apple hard cider they had, Ace i believe? It was the best cider I've ever had.    and whatever you do, don't park in the lot across the street! insta-tow will get your car before you've crossed the street",

Service had a little room for improvement - 20 minutes to bring me the wine I ordered; hostess was a little short with me when I asked if I could sit at the bar (four open seats) and snottingly told me that all seats had at least a 20 minute wait.  Vegas restaurants  seem to have an attitude that you're lucky to be there these days.  That's True to a lesser degree in Chicago, but Vegas is more extreme in this way.  But, as my skin gets a bit thicker, it's not worth docking a star for.  Just be aware that they have a bit of a smug arrogance to their approach to dealing with customers.  Overall, it was a pleasant-ish experience and I would give it one more try.",

I got the fried green tomato (crab) sandwich.  It was pretty good, 3.5/5.  The crab was seasoned with an odd herb combo which I thought may have been rosemary?  It was still good, just different to my pallet.  The others in my party ordered the bacon jam, the sliders, and gyro tacos, and they even comped us a free Mac n Cheese because they brought a plate out late.  Everything was pretty enjoyable overall.  My one complaint would be the tater tots.  They are seasoned very heavily, almost overkill.  The beer menu was a little different as well, probably could be expanded upon to better match and compliment the food flavors.  Venue has a industrial loft inspiration with interesting lighting and exposed brick, and the upstairs patio was raved about.  Very downtown Vegas vibe for sure.  The staff was great and super welcoming, friendly and willing to accommodate.",

When it first opened, service was super slow, but we've gone a few times since and it's definitely gotten better.   Used to not be a fan of \"small/social\" plates but I think Carson's is what made me turn the corner. Perhaps the best thing on the menu/best thing I've probably eaten in a verrry long time is the Bacon Jam. Sorry arteries. Served with some toasted brioche toast, it is just amazing.

Not sure who speaks like that, but...well he was just awesome and so was Michelle and the line cook who makes the cold dishes and desserts.  Everything was perfect!! And I definitely dont say that about a lot. I don't usually like beets and their best salad was to die for. So much so I actually had to order another. A stinking beet salad!!!  I was also obsessed with the red snapper and that sauce. Oh my gosh that freaking sauce!!! And to top it off the donut for dessert was superb. The atmosphere was quaint but super hipster almost felt like I didn't belong, big everyone was sooooo cool and kind! We had a great time and will definitely be back.

When reiterating that rooftop was preferred, again I felt like she wanted to dissuade us by saying it would be an additional 20 mins to the 30 we already waited. We were willing to wait, then miraculously there was seating available right at that moment... Seating at 4 tables actually. Then when we left, she didn't make eye contact, but the hostess next to her spoke and gave a happy smile. So I acknowledged how I appreciated her for actually speaking.

Fortunately, things got better very quickly after. Roman (our waiter) was really outstanding. He was fast, courteous, and extremely helpful. We ordered 6 plates for two people to eat (this was way too much for, and Roman did warn us it was a lot). But the tastes were great. The steak was absolutely the best!!! At first, we thought the seating was odd, but we struck up conversations with other folks there, and it was quickly very comfortable and even fun. The journal books at the end are a nice touch too.

We tried as much as we could -- the watermelon salad, the rainbow cauliflower, baked mac & cheese, turkey burger, stroganoff, and the short rib sliders. I washed it down with a nice cold, floral wheat lager (which I'm so bummed I forgot the name Geronimo set me up with ). Let me tell you-- you are missing out if you don't go HAM and try a little of everything. All of the above were great. Watermelon salad -- light, fresh, zesty and with the perfect amount of feta cheese. Rainbow cauliflower -- buttery, crunchy, zesty and visually appealing. Baked mac and cheese -- creamy, tasted like white cheddar Mac and cheese baked with crunchies on it. Stroganoff -- beefy, melt-in-your-mouth type of sensation *just get it*. Short rib sliders -- bite size, meaty, sweet caramelized oniony goodness. I would like to emphasize on the amaaaazing tater tots they serve with the sliders! Have you had hot fries when you were a kid? NOSTALGIA once you pop one of these in your mouth (yeah that's what she said). But no really the seasoning is on point. I have to admit these are THE BEST tater tots I've ever had.",

I doubt humans have before or will ever again invent a better reason for existing on this earth.  The atmosphere near sundown on the rooftop is definitely something to appreciate. It left an intimate setting for my group and I and made the whole experience something to look forward to repeating on our next trip to Vegas.  P.S. Thanks to Matt the manager for coming to our table and making sure all was well. Great staff.",

My only criticism was that they were in the process of changing over menus and so a number of food and alcohol items that I wanted from the menu were actually not available.

Carson Kitchen has a really sweet and genuine staff with great knowledge of the menu (how its prepared, the ingredients that go into it, etc.) The food is strangely unique and everything is super tasty. I feel like the menu changes semi frequently, so I'll refrain from commenting on each individual dish.  My complaints:   1. The setup - Come in the winter on a windy day and when the door opens, all your stuff gets blown over and you turn into a popcicle. Come in on a summer day and when the door opens, your stuff gets blown over and you melt into a pile of sweat. 2. Their prices - Carson Kitchen costs more than some places on the Strip!

    "text": "Excellent place to eat. Choose the bar against the kitchen to watch the chefs prepare the food. One thing that caught my eye was the fun they had doing their jobs. They clearly enjoy preparing food and they get along with each other. It was a bit relieving to see that the folks making my food didn't have a bad attitude about it.   This shows clearly in the preparation as well, our plates looked great. I watched as the waiters and other staff helped to make each order look it's best before it was taken out to a customer.   The portions are perfect. Not too much. Just enough to enjoy the flavors and fill you up, but not so much that you don't want to do anything after you're done.    Don't hesitate to give this place your business.",

    "text": "First of all, compliments to the great staff of Carson Kitchen. From the wait staff, management, kitchen staff and, of course, Chef Brandon.  From the start, we are greeted cheerfully by the hostess, and quickly sat at the bar with a kitchen view. I don't know about you, but I love to cook and watching them prep is relaxing to me. Our wait staff took our drink orders promptly, and served our drinks quickly as well.   Our first item was called Crispy Chicken skins with smoked honey. One word for this dish: phenomenal. My friend and I were gobbling up this dish when our second food arrived. It's called Barbecue Burnt End Tri tips. I was still on the skins when my best friend Will told me I have to try the second dish. So I did. I thought the skins were great, but compared to the tri tips, it paled in comparison. The tri tips were just excellent. The second dish were getting murdered like there was no tomorrow. That's when our third dish came, and it was called Bacon Jam with Brie. Now, I've tried other bacon jams, and the mix was either too much bacon (even though there's no such thing as too much bacon), or too much jam. The Bacon Jam at Carson Kitchen are in perfect harmony. The split between the two are perfect. Matched with baked brie elevates the flavor even more.  Now, the food were excellent but it wasn't just about the food. The staff were on top of their game as well. The wait staff and management were checking in on us, but not in an annoying kinda way. They checked on us in opportune time, not when we are midbite on our food. Hahaha!   The greatest kudos goes to the Wait staff especially Chef Brandon. Here's the thing, most kitchen staff are busy with prep work and cooking. Even though the kitchen was busy, they still took time out to interact with us, and that really made the experience great.  Chef Brandon, you can tell he's busy but he still takes time to talk to us. Now, even though he's busy and talking to us, his priority was still cooking the entrees so all the other customers weren't waiting long times for their orders. Now, that's service.   The only regret that I have is that we were only there for a small amount of time and only got to experience the appetizers. If the appetizers were that great, I can NOT wait to try the entrees.   I would DEFINITELY come back for the appetizers, and would DEFINITELY take my time and experience their entrees. I definitely recommend Carson Kitchen to everyone. That includes family, friends, and people I don't know. It is THAT great.",

    "text": "Carson Kitchen has become a go-to favorite of mine in Downtown Las Vegas.  My most recent visit was truly exceptional.  The restaurant recently upgraded and expanded their dining area and the whole vibe has really improved.  The new tables and seating allow for more space between parties and really give a good amount of space to fill with the delicious shareable plates Carson has become known for.  My favorite items on the menu are the Burnt Ends (the pickles are INCREDIBLE!) and the Jerk Turkey Burger with mango chutney.  The flavoring is out of this world good.  I could easily eat either one on a VERY regular basis!  The bar, too, has improved and although I'm not one to drink a great deal with my meal, I know I can always find a delicious cocktail, beer or wine to pair with whatever I choose.    The constant through all of the changes?  The service.  Dakota is definitely a fan-favorite of this reviewer and if you get a chance to stop by CK, ask for him and you'll see why.  Just the right amount of attention, great suggestions for both food AND drinks and a warm personality make for a fantastic service experience.  I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit to Carson Kitchen...there's always something new to try!",

The directions from YELP put us in the wrong place on 6th street but after a quick phone call to the establishment they got us headed in the right direction. Find the white building with blue trim on Carson!  Thank you to Philip T for the awesome list of local favorites. We're so glad you told us about this place!  There are different seating areas, one is a community table near the bar, one is a bar near the kitchen with the remaining seating being tables for 2-4 persons.  Because I was in a hipster locale I had to get a hipster drink so I got my new favorite beverage, the Moscow Mule. It was delicious!  We started with the Devils Eggs and they were so tasty!  Next we enjoyed the Gyro Tacos, and the Black Bean Oxtail Risotto. I have a total sweet tooth and the Donut bread pudding did not disappoint!  The service was outstanding and the food came out from the kitchen quickly so that it was perfectly hot when it was served.  This place is a foodies dream and we'll definitely be back again!  In the meantime, Carson Kitchen, how about opening up a location in Orange County, CA?  Please?",

    "text": "So this review was actually super difficult for me to write. I loved the food but was less than satisfied with the service.   As other Yelpers have mentioned, it is extremely difficult to find. It is a great place to visit off strip but just know it will be a bit of a hike if you don't have a car. In addition, be ready to pay for parking. Meters and street parking can be extremely hard to come by so you may need to pay for a spot in a lot. Good news about this though, if you choose to walk around Fremont after dinner you won't have to feed the meter.  The food - so delish! Be ready to split a lot of things with your family and/or friends. Sharing is definitely the best way to go when eating at Carson Kitchen. As unhealthy as they probably are, the crispy chicken skins are to die for - so delish! I also am a sucker for good green beans - they were definitely fabulous! In addition, I loved the scallops. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu - the only item we tried that we weren't huge fans of was the crab fondue - it just wasn't really our style.   The bar service was what killed my group. The running joke was we had to order our next drink when our drink arrived as it took that long for us to get fresh ones. This could have just been a busy night or something; however it was disappointing to my group that they would have to wait a while for their next drink.   Definitely would come back to this place - it seems like their menu changes up quite a bit so I would be extremely interested to see what they come up with next!",

Friends were in town on the strip so I finally had an excuse to come here and so glad we did. We spent at least 2 hours here and started out with 3 of their best apps:  Fried Chicken Skins (something my mom makes all the time) - they serve this with honey but I prefer hot sauce so asked for sriracha sauce  Tempura Green Beans  BBQ Burnt Ends   I ended up ordering the Fried Chicken Sandwich (Secret Sunday Chicken) and immediately regretted it since the apps were so good and filling already.   They have a really good drink menu, try the Towns End, if you're into whiskey . This a great spot when you are really hungry.",

    "text": "I finally was able to try this place. It's in downtown Las Vegas and I had been wanting to go here forever.  It took a while to find because it is inside an old motel that I thought was still abandoned. I feel like this is part of specialness of this place. You feel accomplished once you find it and feel like you are in on the secret of where it is located.  Their menu is a bunch of small plates that are meant to share with a large party. They also have a few items, such as their burger, that weren't mean to for sharing.  You have to have an open mind and not be a picky eater to eat here. They have a lot of different yet delicious pairings.  It is a bit on the pricy side but if you go with a large group of people I feel like the cost will even itself out. Since it was only my uncle and I it felt a bit pricy and I felt a bit cheated with going with only two people because I couldn't try as much. Next time I come I would like to come with a larger party.  I would have to say the best item I tried was the bacon jam. I'm not even a big bacon fan (yes, I know, I'm weird) but I really loved this dish. It had brie cheese on top and you were able to spread the jam on bread that accompanied the dish. It kind of tasted like smoked meat and was delicious. I would definitely get this again.  I also ordered the mac and cheese. It was good but very heavy. I feel like I would have been fine with just a scoop because of how heavy it was. I feel like this would be a good dish to get with a larger group of people.  We also ordered the devil eggs which were just meh. I have had better and would recommend trying something else.  Overall I had a great experience. A tad on the pricy side but then again it is downtown. I would try this place again once I've gone to a few other DT restaurants.",

We came here during Life if Beautful weekend for lunch. We sat on the upstairs open air patio which is nice to do in Vegas when weather permits.  We had the truffled deviled eggs (delish and good portion) to share. My wife got the beet salad which was well made and just enough to hold her over for dinner. I got the lamb tacos, which were also delicious, however the amount of meat was not nearly enough to satiate me.... I was a little hungry when we walked away. That is my only complaint.  They had some create cocktails and a decent beer/wine list. I had the malbec ($9) and it was decent. If you are looking for something unique and tasty, I recommend giving this place a shot.",

So, I believe that some of the menu items that we tried at the time are no longer available now.  I don't believe that we made reservations,  but we got there right when they were opening for dinner.  Got a parking spot right in front of the restaurant,  and we were seated right away.  Location is in downtown close to Fremont St.  Charming restaurant with good food and service.  Here is a rundown of the above average fare we shared that evening.  Crispy Chicken Skins were delicious!  I'd order that item of crispy goodness again!  (4.5 stars)  Tempura Green Beans were good.  I don't think you would be disappointed with this either.  (3.5 stars)  Rainbow Cauliflower was something that I enjoyed more than the Tempura Green Beans.  (4 stars)  Pork Belly Carbonara was okay, but not as good as I thought it would taste.  (3 stars)  Butter Burger with Tater Tots was delicious!  Try it for yourself!  (4.5 stars)  Pork Osso Buco was okay.  Again, I was expecting more out of this choice.  Was good though.  (3.5 stars)  Carson Kitchen in Las Vegas is a fine dining option.  I recommend you check them out too.",

We could not wait as we have a show at 9 pm. No help whatsoever, leaving me embarrassed and finding another restaurant at 7pm on a Sunday. Not how you treat your locals, guys.  UPDATE: I was contacted by the owner immediately after posting the review above. He invited me back in to try it again and I must tell you that everything was amazing from food to service. Evidently my original res slipped through the cracks; mistakes will happen but what's most important is what happens next and Cory and his staff more than exceeded my expectations.  Tonight we had the tempura green beans, new beets and goat cheese, baked mac & cheese and the espresso rubbed NY-each dish stood on its own individually and all were outstanding. Our server Roman and the MOD were pleasant and attentive. We sat next to a couple from North Carolina whose Uber driver had recommended the restaurant and for good reason.

The vibe and feel of the place is terrific and the food is to die for!!! This place truly embodies all the great characteristics of the \"New Downtown Experience.\" My Food recommendations are as follows:  Appetizers  Chicken Skins - a little spice with honey to offset Bacon Jam - self explanatory   Food Secret Sunday Chicken or Butter Burger Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto Seared Scallops  Drinks Ask your waitress. They have a large selection of wines, beers, ciders, and specialty drinks",

    "text": "First time I visited Carson Kitchen it was the new guy on the Downtown block. The restaurant, since its incarnation has seen great praise, on Yelp, in local Las Vegas scenes, and has even gone national.  There is no doubt the food here is good, inspired, and not your typical grub. Carson Kitchen is for a day when you feel like splurging on veal meatballs topped with foie gras cream, which I did and they were absolutely delightful. This dish is pleasant and warming, like Swedish meatballs, a dish you might imagine your Grammy serving you on a cold winter night. But the foie cream is what gives it that Carson Kitchen difference.  Crispy chicken skins and honey dipping sauce. Pretty much one of the last meals you need to eat before you die and leave this Earth. Good eats and simple eats. The portion is also good for the price.  Bison sliders offer up a meaty variation on your old beef burger sliders. These should not be missed as they have a tangy BBQ sauce that melds oh so happily with the lean bison burger. Paired up with some crispy tater tots, and you have yourself a winner.  Service was decent, some hit or miss spots here and there. But at least they were willing to split the bill between myself and my friend this time.   Lunch time is best in my opinion, but get there early or you'll be waiting, or you may not even get to eat, depending on how long your lunch break is.  Solid Downtown eatery. I will be back.",

We asked for a table and she denied one stating that tables were for parties of 6 even though the tables were empty. We asked her to move us to another section in the bar, and she said it was too difficult, after me getting serious and asking why, she moved us with the worst attitude ever, and the came and literally threw the ice water not even placing it properly.  Then we were waited by a nice waiter and had a just OK dinner. The BBQ tips were too sweet and did not taste like nice home-made bbq sauce, bread was not fresh. Veal Meatballs were just OK, nothing special. Macn Cheese was quite nice. And the grilled cheese sandwich was just OK.  Tables remained empty during the whole stay of our dinner, almost two hours.  Sorry to know that a place that has a nice decor and could offer a nice hipster ambiance experience is ruined by the hostess who works there.",

Let me just preface this by saying I love Boursin cheese, all my friends make fun of me for how much I love it, and I've never seen it on a menu before.  First, the ambiance was pretty good. They had an open kitchen and we sat at the bar, so we could actually watch the chefs as they cooked the food. The chefs were also friendly, so all around a cool experience  Next, the food was pretty good! I wished it was better given that it had Boursin, but it didn't blow my mind. The crispy chicken skins were good, but be warned they felt like a heart attack waiting to happen. The butter burger was the one with Boursin in it. It came with tater tots which were just normal, and the burger was alright. The best thing we got was probably the Mac and cheese! That too had Boursin in it (told you I'm obsessed), and that was truly delicious.",

We sat on the rooftop deck and although it was cold outside the heat lamps kept us warm.  We got our drinks right away and the waitress told us about how the food is group food and meant to be shared.  We loved this.  We got the Jalapeno poppers, potatoes and the steak.  Every Bit was incredible, and the portions were perfect for the price and for sharing.  I've been into Ciders a lot this year and tried the berry Cider they had which was very good but I think she liked it a lot more.

What we got:  Chicken skins- I wish this was a way smaller portion because the first couple pieces were good then it was just oily and not that great. If you have a huge group I'd get one order so you can try it because it's so different. Asparagus- SO YUM! Butter Burger- I personally didn't love but others did Jamaican Turkey Burger- I LOVED!

    "text": "I post this review with mix emotions, I love eating here ever since I found it on a weekend getaway. We have come back many times with fam/friends. I also refer others (blogging, IG, FB), (Love Bacon Jam). With that said I feel a little gouged. Let me explain; I thought it would be a perfect place to host a bachelor party dinner (patio). So I went ahead to set up for a dinner at 8 pm. But as u know it's hard to wrangle up 12 guys from drinking, napping, and gambling. So I called to say I was running late, they said that was fine. So we had a good dinner. Then we got the catering bill, and then I noticed an additional charge of $300. I was like shocked. The manager said your party was charged $150 for \"every 30 mins\" past the reservation which was noted in the catering contract. Totally my fault for not getting the group there on time (and for not reading the details of the contract). But then I reviewed the bill, and I noticed the bill had a time stamp of 10:39 pm, Our reservation was to be from 8-10pm. So I was puzzled when I was charged 2 increments. Come Monday when I had a chance to recover from Vegas (getting too old for this stuff), looking back on the event, I was left to wonder if those additional 9 mins were totally attributed to us and only us? I recalled several possible factors that could have contributed to those extra 9 mins. Here are some that stuck out in my mind. 1) Even thou the waiter was nice, he did go on some long stories about his life in Las Vegas, fine...nice guy but let's get the food out. 2) Waiter decides to hold some food from the table until we finish other appetizers, which we had plenty of room for the food for the table plus with that many guys we would go through everything quickly, no need to wait, but to go back and forth from the stairs takes time. 3) The waiter was nice of enough to bring us extra desserts for us to consume even thou we were already done with dessert,(added time to our event). 4) When fixing the bill, he rang up the alcohol on the catering bill we had said to leave it on a separate check, so the waiter had to go back and adjust the bill. then I get the bill at 10:39. So what I am trying to say is those extra 9 mins could have been caused by many factors that we were not in our control/fault. I called the Carson kitchen later that week. Again everyone was courteous and professional. The GM heard me out, and I explained to him the situation like I stated above. He said he would take this back to the owner (Cory H) because he would ultimately have the final word. I mention again that I'm not looking for a full refund just a partial refund or maybe even a credit for next time. But from the some of the conversation with the managers at the restaurant and over the phone it seemed that the reason they were charging me was because they have been \"burn\" before. It seemed to me, Carson Kitchen wanted to punish us for being \"late\" and for staying over our time. So which is it then, are you charging us for being late or having the party go past the time or both? Because the contract makes it seem, I should have only been charged for each 30 minutes past my time and not for showing up late (which you guys made it seem, for both). It almost seems that it was out of anger or resentment for past situations with other customers, and I was told any chance of a refund would mean that they would be taking a loss. Which I totally understand why I was charged for the 1st 30 mins (would I have been charged at 10:01pm if I came at 8pm?)...and far as a \"lost\"...I mean it's not like I consumed $150 worth of food and then I asking for a refund for that...this is 9 mins we are talking about that could have been caused by Carson kitchen staff or us. In the end, $150 would not have bankrupted Carson kitchen or myself or created anarchy among other patrons. I think the compromise or gesture from Carson Kitchen would have been nice, it would have garnered so much more effort from me to post on yelp about the situation in a more positive manner than I am now. This situation has left a bad taste in my mouth, and I found myself hard to recommend this place without letting them know about this incident (I really did like this place). I truly believe in the power of 5, 1 person will tell 5 other people and those other 5 people will tell 5 other people, but in today's age with media, it's more like 1 person tells thousand other people and so on. I appreciate Matt's effort to speak to the owner and even offer me a drink to bury the hatchet the next time I'm in town. But what I really want to ask Cory H was that $150 charge for 9min worth alienating a frequent customer? Again thank you, Matt and Julie, for being understanding and handling our business. I give the food 4 stars, standard service 3 stars but catering operation 1 stars. Total 8 stars divided by 3 categories = 2.6 avg stars (just in case you wondered how I came up with that rating.

Went upstairs, sat at a table and we were told we could not sit there because the tables were \"for reservations.\" The tables had seating for four, not six. Why they were for reservations were did not undersstand because the hostest said, \"reservations were for parties of 6 or more.\" The whole expierence was confusing, made no sense and we left. On our way out we asked about all the empty tables and the hostest said, \"they were for reservations.\"",

However the absolute best part of our visit here was our server, Bianca. This says nothing about the quality of our food (DELICIOUS) but everything about how well we were taken care of. She was very attuned to our unspoken needs and comfort. Ultimately, she made us feel special even on a very busy night. Thanks, Bianca!",

For all of my trips back to Vegas, I make sure Carson Kitchen is on my list of places to eat! You can't believe how good a crispy chicken skin dipped into a bacon jam really is!!",

Our server was very quirky to say the least. We were waiting to ask Fr our check for over 20 minutes.

The dining room was a hour wait on a Thursday evening so my coworker and I ended up going to the bar which was free.  Note that the bar has about 8 - 10 seats in a line and no TV so you better like who your dinner company is that evening because there won't be anything else to entertain you other then the bartender!  Speaking of which, the bartender was nice friendly and funny.  The FOOD...well what can I say, the butter burger I had was exceptional.  The meat was juicy and flavorful and you could taste the strong butter flavor in the bun.  You can tell the ingredients are exceptionally high quality, particularly at the price point.  My coworker had the mac and cheese as well as the gyro tacos.  Both items looked delicious but maybe it was just me but they seemed on the smaller side?  He mentioned how two of the dishes were needed before he was full.  The decor is very contemporary and the restaurant itself was very clean. It was very busy when we went but only had to wait a couple of minutes for a table to be cleared.   I love the little quirks of getting your check in an old hardback book.  Carson Kitchen is well worth another visit, but I'd like to try the dining room next time.",

The servers are always so friendly and knowledgeable, they are definitely up-to-date on how dishes are prepared and will build a menu around your taste preferences.   On my last visit, I sent my drink back because I simply didn't like it, and feeling awful I apologized over and over. The sever told me it wasn't a problem at all, and got me a negroni instead. The Caesar with bacon is to die for, and the deviled eggs are the app I always order. I'd probably have a mini heart attack if they took those eggs off the menu.   The star of the show however is their secret Sunday chicken sandwich. Served with tots, I usually feel full for anywhere upwards of 8 hours after eating there, but Carson Kitchen is definitely worth spending your calories for the day here.",

    "text": "Located off the strip in Downtown Las Vegas, the crowd and vibes are way more relaxed.  This spot was a little tricky to find but when we finally did, we were so glad we didn't give up!  One of the employees met us outside and recognized our look of confusion and showed us the way.  We were seated indoors right away at a communal high top table because we desperately needed AC. But if you love the sun, you can eat on the outdoor rooftop patio and bar.   The first thing I noticed were the actual menus which were so unique. I immediately knew that the food would be amazing because if someone puts that much thought into a menu, then they've definitely put a lot of thought and care into crafting delicious cocktails and dishes.  We ordered the Machu Peach-U cocktail. It was a peachy take on a Peruvian Pisco sour, with Smith & Cross Jamaica rum, Giffard creme de peche, Barso pisco, fresh lemon & lime, bar keep saffron bitters, and finished with a fluffy egg white on top. I loved it!  Our first appetizer was the KILLER SHRIMP with rocoto & aji amarillo pepper cream. It looked and tasted similarly to Walnut Shrimp from a Chinese restaurant, minus the walnuts, and had a spicy kick at the end.    Our second app were the PORK WINGS with buffalo bleu beurre blanc. They were the most succulent juicy pork belly bites dipped in a little buffalo sauce. They were finger licking good!!  Next we ordered the baked mac n cheese. I'm not sure what cheeses were used but it was creamy, dreamy, delicious.   Our entree was the COCOA-ESPRESSO NY STRIP with red wine demi. It was perfection! I couldn't distinguish the cocoa or espresso flavors, but they must've worked well together because I took pleasure in each juicy bite.   Dessert... Oh, my... I love donuts. I love bread pudding. And yes,  they actually made a GLAZED DONUT BREAD PUDDING!!!! It was almost shaped like a mushroom- the top was donut and it became softer at the base, almost like flan. I had the biggest smile of sheer bliss on my face and I closed my eyes to make the flavors and that feeling last as long as possible.   three rum caramel, vanilla creme anglaise",

(be sure to make a reservation since this place fills up quickly and it's not that big inside with maybe less than 10 tables.   Roman was our server and he recommended that we do family style dining, where you order numerous dishes and basically everyone in the table gets a little bit of everything. This concept is financially feasible especially when you have a larger group, plus everyone gets to experience the same dining experience!   We basically ordered one of everything on the appetizers page. To make it even, Roman just added extra here and their so everyone got one of everything.   My favorite items from the appetizers list are:  *Fried Chicken Skins with honey dipping sauce  *Rocket Fire Shrimp: These are crunchy pieces of shrimp tossed in a creamy kick sauce!  *Bacon Jam (yep, bacon Jam!) *Mac n' Cheese: you just taste the truffle, which I'm totally okay with! *Veal meat balls  My favorite alchie bevie is called \"Get Shorty.\"",

It certainly was good but not the best meal I have ever had.  To be fair, there's a lot of competition in LV and we are well traveled so the bar is high.  All that stated, the crispy chicken skins with smoked honey are worth returning for and definitely a dish we will rave about to others when making recommendations of where to grab a bite in LV.  Food was served quickly and service was on point.   The pork belly buffalo bites were ok. I think I got two dry bites cuz they were hard...my bf's pieces looked juicy.    Veal meatballs were full of flavor but needed more texture.   We want to return and try the steak and chicken thighs...and have more of those f'ing amazing chicken skins.",

    "text": "One of the best restaurants we ate at in Vegas. We opted for Tapas-style ordering, since it looks like shared plates are their speciality. We ordered:  + Tahini Carrots + Kale and Beet Caesar Salad + Oxtail and black rice risotto + Pork Belly  All of these were awesome, especially the Tahini carrots. However, I probably would not order the risotto again---I couldn't really taste the oxtail, and I thought that the parmesan cream overpowered the rest of the dish. Instead, I wish I had tried their chicken skins dish.  Drinks: + Town's End: This was good, but the drink itself is a standard citrus + whisky preparation, which a lot of craft cocktail places have some version of. + Margarian: This has very strong cucumber taste, and I thought it was a more unique drink than Town's End  My biggest complaint is that the decor and general menu are a bit too generic to \"hipster\" restaurants. The decor and menu are a standard, \"New American\" style, with metal stools, dark lighting, and pork belly. I felt like this restaurant could just as easily be located in Austin or Berkeley or Boulder. I think a little more local flair could make this place a real destination in Vegas.",

After we sat down, the waiter immediately gave his spiel about the dining style of the restaurant. He was a little impatient when getting our attention, and there were 15 of us sitting at an L shaped table.. also, when we walked in and mentioned table for 15, the host and another waiter made a face, like \"oh no, seriously?\" I get it were a big party but no need for the attitude :(  The waiter took all of our drink orders, and when they came out, it was perfect! No one got their drinks mixed up or anything.   Their menu selection is pretty wide. They're all meant to be shared, that means you can order a few plates and eat it family style. Perfect if you wanna try many things on the menu. My boyfriend and I shared the steak, oxtail risotto and veal meatballs. The meatballs were 11/10 while the other two dishes were just okay. Some of my friends got the butter burger, it was pretty good. The tater tots that came with them complemented the dish really well.   My drink was pretty good but a little light on the alcohol (tbh almost non-existent), but it tastes refreshing. I got the Magarian.   Overall the service was good (except the part where the waiter got impatient), food is great and if I'm ever in the area again I'd definitely come back.",

It had been a while since I had visited when I wrote my last review, as pointed out to me by the manager, and I thought it would be only right to come back.  So I did. This time I brought a colleague in tow (it was my treat).  We ordered the lamb tacos, and some spicy shrimp diablo, that was really delicious.  The lamb was flavorful, but just a tiny bit stringy.  The fried chicken skins were a little gummy, but the sauce was excellent.  The beet salad was absolutely 100% perfect. I liked the chocolate dessert, but it was bit too dense and cloying.  The other one (which I'm not remembering right now), was a bit better.  The seating is mostly at high tops, which I'm not a fan of, and music was way too loud to enjoy a proper \"power\" lunch with business chums.  Service was a bit affected.  It was fine.  It was fun.  I think the food more properly is 4 stars, on more reflection.  But I still give the overall experience a 3.  It's not an \"average\" experience to be sure, but for me, personally, I am not a super fan.  I do appreciate the concept, and I have more respect for the serious investment of commitment and artistry in making food like this, and in operating a restaurant like this.  But I am probably not the target audience. You might be, and you should check it out!",

Since we have friends in town from Hawaii, my boyfriend and I decided to take them here for brunch yesterday. I definitely have to say that no matter how many times we come here, this place still impresses us with their excellent service and food.   The second we walked through the door, we were immediately greeted by the nice hostess who seated us. The menu has changed quite a bit since the last time we were here; so our server, Manny, was very nice to answer any questions we had and gave us his suggestions. Although the menu is made for sharing, there are a few dishes you can order if you don't want to share. For a group of 5, we ordered the bacon jam with brie, chicken skins with honey, and mac and cheese (which have always been our favorite items on the menu). In addition, we ordered the deviled eggs, pork wings, cocoa espresso rubbed steak, and the oxtail risotto with black rice. Everything came out hot and delicious! Our friends particularly enjoyed the chicken skins and bacon jam.   Overall, the service and food here was fantastic. Manny was super friendly and attentive in refilling our drinks and making sure everything was made to our liking. We will continue to keep coming back again and again. I highly recommend this place!",

First, the crispy chicken skins. Think pork rinds. That's basically what you are eating but doused in a season salt that is so heavy and salty you can't even taste the chicken. We sat at the bar where you can see everything being made and the chef shakes on about half a pound of salt.   The bacon jam had great flavor but was super sweet with just a tiny slice of cheese. You could have tippled the cheese and there still would have been way more of the sweet jam.   Roasted cauliflower smelled delicious when it was brought over but it had such a heavy lemon flavor it was almost not edible.   We really enjoyed the kale Cesar and loved watching the flat breads being made but didn't try those.   Prices were very fair and like I said earlier, service was great. We both left with dry mouth from all the salt. That was our biggest takeaway.",

With all the overwhelming positive reviews, we were excited to try it!  Our server Felicia was amazing! We asked for recommendations and she gave us quite a few. We decided to go with the bacon jam, devil's eggs, and jerk turkey burger. The bacon jam is perfect blend of sweet and savory, and is served with toastinis. The devil's eggs was creamy and delicious. The turkey burger had nicely toasted buns, topped with cole slaw. It also comes with a side of spicy tater tots.  Unfortunately I have little to no tolerance for spicy items (my friend loves spicy though!) and I found the bacon jam and jerk turkey burger to be very spicy. Luckily, Felicia kept refilling my water as I was chugging the cup after every bite of the food. Everything was very delicious! Despite the spiciness, my favorite dish from that day is actually the bacon jam!",

When we first entered a man held open the door for us and was super friendly. We sat at the top level at the bar and all the staff were very nice.  The food was delicious. I didn't realize it was tapas style so my boyfriend and I got a few dishes to share. We ordered the killer shrimp which had a spicy kick, the chicken sandwich with spicy tots which was really juicy, the gyro tacos which were hearty and amazing, and the Mac n cheese which was rich, cheesy, and everything you'd want in a Mac and cheese.  Definitely a little pricey but it was worth it.",

In all fairness the staff tried to make amends but then came the meal.  We were told dishes come when they are ready but three of us were finished with our meal when the flatbread came out for one in our party. We were told the chicken would come the latest but after a long wait anyway the flatbread arrived 15 minutes after the first dish of mains is served after stating clearly we were not sharing. That's simply not acceptable.  I will not return to this restaurant despite having friends in the area.",

Parking is convenient just across the street (paid parking $1.00 every half hour). We arrived an hour and a half before closing and we had to wait for 15 minutes so we grabbed a drink at the bar Molbec red wine for me and the bartender recommended  Bad Beat Hoppy Times IPA for my sister -- which she loved. Prices are reasonable for the drinks. (Total was $16 and change)  There are comfortable bench seats arranged around a fire pit in the back patio which my sister and I occupied as we waited, and we loved and took a lot of pics around :) haha  Our server was friendly enough. He explained the servings a bit and wasn't too pushy when urging us to order a bit more than we did and giving us the option to order more as we go. Sis and I weren't too hungry so we decided to split the Mac n Cheese and the Butter burger.  The Mac n Cheese was so tasty! I told my sis I shoulda ordered another one to go haha it was the perfect amount of cheesy and the bread crumbs on top gave it a light crunch/more flavor! The butter burger was alright, we both agreed, nothing too special. Spicy tater tots were good though! Really wanted to try the bread pudding but we were both stuffed, as we werent too hungry to begin with. The bill came out to be $26.  I really liked the ambiance, and it was intimate. It seemed like the clientele enjoyed the setting as well. I would definitely come back again!",

What they had was still pretty good.  Went with a bottle of average Pinot Noir with dinner.    We had 4 of us in our party and we ordered from a fairly large tapas type menu. We probably ordered 10 items and they were all great.  The loaded deviled eggs were excellent. The order comes with 4 with a topping of caviar on each. Pretty damn good!  Pretty reasonably priced and definitely a place I'd go to again when I go to Vegas.",

We were seated right away which was a nice surprise, given that it was Memorial Day weekend. We sat at the bar and had the pleasure of having Felicia as our bartender. She served us some fantastic cocktails and recommend a few dishes for our meal:   * Bacon Jam: tons of bacon, reduced in jam, and topped with Brie, served with toasted buttered baguettes. 4/5 *  Young Beets: a tasty beet salad with red/green grapes & goat cheese. Loved this 5/5 * Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip: reduced in a red wine sauce. We ordered medium rare but it was a little over cooked; the flavor was really good though. 3/5  * Turkey Jerk Burger: A very unique burger... we were pleasantly surprised. It had a mango chutney slaw that took it to another level. 4/5 * Glazed Donut Bread Pudding: I'm usually not a fan of bread pudding but man, this was SO good. A must try. 5/5  We also ordered the Crispy Chicken Skins with the smoked honey sauce but weren't really a big fan of it. We found that the batter overwhelmed the chicken skin. But Felecia graciously took it back for us and we appreciated that very much; we opted for the Turkey Jerk Burger instead.  Honestly speaking, the food was good but the drinks were even better. We got two rounds of the Mezcal Negroni, a Towns End, and an herbaceous gin cocktail with lime that our bartender made, and it was on point. Just what I wanted.   So if you want a break from The Strip, you're definitely going to want to check out Carson Kitchen. It's cool spot with outstanding service.",

Great fruit dish that shines alongside Kerry Simon's excellent veggie dishes. TEMPURA GREEN BEANS: This dish is addictive! Every table around us had an order, and after ours arrived we understood why. It's crunchy, it's savory, it's sweet with a bit of spice. The red pepper cream cheese is sinful. Just get it. BLACK RICE & OXTAIL RISOTTO: Didn't quite have the usual risotto texture or consistency, but the dish itself was so savory and indulgent. Rich and flavorful, meatier than expected.  GYRO TACOS: This was a bit of a letdown. Cool concept but poor execution. The pita taco shells are super dry and floury, and the taco filling was overly seasoned to the point that it didn't even resemble lamb. BISON MEATLOAF SLIDERS: Awesome upgrade from the original Dr. Pepper sliders. The bison was moist and flavorful, complemented nicely by the crispy onions. Side of spicy tots was nicely seasoned and crunchy. If you aren't sharing as a group, this would be an adequate lunch portion. THAI CHICKEN FLATBREAD: This was a fail for us. The cheese just didn't work with the other ingredients. The curry sauce was lackluster. The crisp veggies and crisp flatbread did not harmonize at all.   As long as they keep turning out great dishes, I'll keep coming. But my original claim that their vegetable dishes are where they truly shine still stands. Service remains great, try the rooftop patio if you come by in the evening.",

We sat right at the counter and got to watch the kitchen team cook and create each delicious meal! Our faves were definitely the burnt ends, sunday chicken sandwich, mac and cheese, and black mussels -- all yum! Drinks were also very, very good and the female blond bartender at the roof bar upstairs was very friendly and down to earth. Also loved the firepit and outside \"chill area.\" Worth the uber ride if you're out of town like us and staying on strip!",

Daughter was told this was an adultish environment - and that intrigued her all the more.  No need to expand on everyone else's rave reviews of the food -- over-the-top good; but the prices reflected that MUCH more than the \"$$\" suggests: be prepared.  With that aside, the rest of your experience is OTT as well.  Staff is young, professional, and fun; the music played is fun as well; there are countless enclaves to personalize your experience; and the decor is totally unique - from the pseudo refrigerator door leading to the facilities and cooking area (which is totally open air if you want to sit and watch) to the floor and ceiling work.  In summary, fun to look at, fun to hang out at, fun to eat at.  Oh, fund to pay for too.  But what are Fridays for if not to spend what you earned in a memorable way.",

The bacon jam - delicious and I'm now ruined for life because this place is so far away and I can't have this every time I'm craving it. There is A LOT of bacon jam, so you will probably (definitely) need to ask for a little more bread, which they told us to just let them know if we needed more.   The pizza - oh my goodness the pizza - it was amazing. It was crispy and flavorful and perfect and I was craving more, but was too stuffed from a weekend of over-indulgence to get seconds.   Carson Kitchen will be a regular stop on any trip that I make to Vegas and will recommend it to any friends that I know heading that way.",

    "text": "Wonderful experience! So glad we returned and tried it again!  After my first review, the manager messaged me wanting to know more details about my visit and invited me to return and try it again. So right away, great customer service. And I really appreciate that.  We returned on a Saturday night and got to sit in front of the open kitchen. Dinner with a show! As food lovers, it was a real treat to watch the workings of the kitchen.  Our server, Dakota, was wonderful! He was very friendly and attentive. I asked him for recommendations and we ordered those. He was definitely not wrong!  We started off with the crispy chicken skins and tempura green beans. The chicken skins were definitely not something I would normally ever order. But they were seriously delicious! The seasoning and flavor was so tasty. And the smoked honey to dip them in went perfectly. And the portion was pretty big too. The green beans weren't exactly flavorful (but hey, they're green beans). But they were nice and long and perfectly coated and fried. And the pepper jelly cream cheese dipping stuff was seriously delicious and added a really nice flavor with subtle spiciness. And again, a pretty large portion.  For the next course, we went with the cocoa espresso NY strip and mac 'n' cheese. Yum, yum, yum! We were seriously impressed. We weren't sure between medium rare and medium, so our server put it in as medium rare plus.  Who knew that was even possible? It came out perfectly cooked - absolutely perfect. Fantastic crust on the outside and just right on the inside. The flavor was phenomenal! The red wine sauce on top went fabulously with it. It was seriously one of the better steaks we've had in town - and that's saying a lot. We're literally still talking about it. Get the NY strip! The mac 'n' cheese was also a real treat. It reminded me a bit of the mac 'n' cheese at Simon (also a Kerry Simon establishment), which I also loved. It was an excellent mix of cheeses, blended and melted very nicely. It had a good sharpness and tanginess. And just the right amount of crustiness. Loved it! And it was the perfect accompaniment to the steak. And both were pretty sizable portions too.  At this point, we were totally stuffed. So much food goodness! But how can you skip dessert? We got the special for the night - banoffee and the donut bread pudding. Both were quite tasty. James O. absolutely loved the banoffee. I particularly liked the biscotti and whipped cream. Very flavorful. The donut bread pudding was a great twist. The rum caramel sauce was a particular favorite aspect of mine.  Oh, and there were cocktails. Tasty and well-made cocktails. Again, going with server recommendations was definitely the way to go. I ordered some I normally probably wouldn't and was pleasantly surprised and pleased.  It was definitely really busy (duh, Saturday night) and the staff seemed to never stop for a second. But despite being so busy, we had wonderful service. And sitting in front of the kitchen made it all the better. We left completely stuffed and very pleased with our dining experience. Do we possibly have a new favorite downtown restaurant? Yes, we do. No doubt we will be back again (and again and again).",

Any of the meters downtown let you add to your specific spot-just don't forget to keep the receipt with lot/space number on it!   The restaurant is small and cozy with a full view of the kitchen. It was pretty packed on a Saturday morning- it's not a place you can go to sit and read for hours.  We ordered the thai chicken flat bread. Not spicy, perfect size for two, not heavy on the cheese. 4/5 The spicy shrimp was a 5/5 for me. Perfect combo of sweet and spicy.   I don't have an issue with this but.... A couple came in with two screaming kids and were given cold looks from other customers throughout their meal. \"Why would you bring your kids here,\" was said by the couple across from them multiple times and loud enough for them to hear.

I'll start off by saying this, it's a small place so having a group of 17 people for a sit down dinner can be a little stressful up in here, but it can happen and it can be amazingly good!  And it's just so beautiful and welcoming in there.  Certainly a place to sit and stay awhile while you sip cocktails, have great conversations and enjoy amazing food.   We made reservations for my man's birthday dinner @ Carson's on a Sunday night around 8:30.  The staff was very obliging with the fact that I didn't want to do a special prefix menu and drinks which was great since I didn't want to make people eat food or drink things they didn't want.    When we arrived (a bit early) the place was full and they weren't quite ready for our group yet.  They let us know there was an outdoor patio area where we could wait with our drinks until our table was ready.  The bartender was a good sport when he got pounded with drink orders - but he handled it professionally and whipped them out for us.  He was shaking and stirring so hard, he had to take off his over shirt to cool down, but he didn't miss a step and made each one deliberately delicious.  He even whipped out some off the menu orders for us.   I stuck with the classic 'Towns End' and it remained my sipping pleasure for the evening.  The outdoor space was really great too.  A little fire pit glowing to keep us warm while we sipped our cocktails and beer.  It's a great area to relax and mingle while you wait for a table.   Once we were finally seated we realized we had a few more people than seats, but the waitress and hostess (though a little frazzled) handled it well and we worked it all out.  Our waitress was the bomb and took control of the orders with gusto and charm!  I loved how organized and knowledgeable she was.  She helped my sister in law figure out what her allergic self could consume and didn't miss a beat when food started arriving about who it went to.   She was energetic and witty from start to finish!  Great job lady!!  I hate that in the chaos I didn't remember this feisty, petite, curly sand blonde headed gal's name.  But I'm sure the owners know they have a catch with her there!  The food - every bit was delish and we tried so many things!!  As a vegetarian, I can attest that there is PLENTY for you to eat here.   Just for starters the Tempura Green Beans, Young Beets and Rainbow Cauliflower were all scrumptious.  Many of my meat eaters loved all their dishes too.   But what topped my evening off was the Bonofee Pie.  Oh my my - this is like your grandmas banana pudding massively upgraded.  As full as I was I licked every last morsel of that off the bowl.  SO GOOD.  I would not hesitate a moment to go back here or recommend it to anyone!  So do yourself a treat and book a table... now!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were here in January and I'm just getting around to the review. First, the location was surprising, on a side street near Fremont. We had a number of dishes: the bacon jam, the beet salad, and the devils eggs were absolutely delicious.  The timing of the dishes was off for me... they brought them as they were prepared, which was one at a time. When we finished one, they would shortly bring another.  I guess that wasn't bad for the shared plates but we each ordered a main plate and they arrived 20 minutes apart.  My boyfriend was already done by the time I got mine and I didn't even have anything to pick at.  Also, the two dinners lacked flavor and originality.  They made what would have been an otherwise 5 star, only 4.  I want to give them another shot for my son's bday dinner, but I can't take the chance. Overall though, the small plates were the best part of the night and we still talk about them.",

Chicken skins were done just perfect nit at all greasy. My guest ordered watermelon salad and I got a bite which was remarkable. The blending of flavors was perfect. I ordered the jerk turkey burger and my husband I ordered the butter burger.  Both were very thick. Some might like that but I thought just too thick to be enjoyable one reason only 4 stars. Flavors were good presentation excellent however if you are not a fan of spicy watch the menu for less spicy dishes.",

    "text": "We came here for lunch after a recent hip Fremont district stay-cation.  Pretty much to kill 2 birds by trying it out and nursing a hangover.  It was pretty busy in there.  We got seated at the bar.  The bartender was a great server and had many good suggestions for our \"situation\".  The decor is completely minimal.  Bare structure is exposed, but in a good way.  Sometimes up dressing and decorating is not needed.  It is quite a tight spot but I believe they have an upper level now, which probably has a spectacular view.  I ordered the Tempura Green Beans.  The Pepper Jelly cream cheese was a nice whipped addition to the lightly crispy large green beans.  4/5 for green beans  I ordered the Wellington Empanadas for my girl.  She said the meat tasted somewhat like a stroganoff.  The sauce was very slight flavored.  I discontinued eating land meats so I cannot give you a rating on this, but, she said it was good.  I had the Broccoli Crunch for myself.  A very fresh and hearty salad.  It had sunflower and pumpkin seeds, grape tomatoes and preserved cranberries.  The green goddess sauce was underscored just enough to grease things up a bit.  The whole salad was executed greatly.  4/5  We shared the Roasted Young Beets.  This came out as the most impressive plate design.  It reminded me of a vegetarian \"Uni to Ukura\" (from Yonaka Modern Japanese)  The roasted beets were soft and mild.  Pair each mouthful with the crushed pistacios, orange slices, goat cheese and micro-greens in each bite.  The mixture is refined.  Nothing out shines the rest of the ingredients.  As a whole the flavors are a symphony that doesn't quite match the beauty of the plate itself.  Still a very notable flavor.  4/5  All of the entrees had a thoughtful execution and I would say the entire menu is meant for the discerning taste bud.  More for those who would prefer a Waldorf salad over Spicy-Nacho Doritos.  With that being said I would highly recommend Carson Kitchen.",

It's two blocks away from the Freemont Street Experience.   (Jason) The manager of the restaurant, Matt, sets the tone that the rest of the team follows. Friendly, inviting, and dedicated to making our dining experience completely different from the depersonalized norm on the strip. The food was outstanding. All the staff was friendly.

The restaurant is not well marked, so it helps to know this.   We went here on the strength of Yelp reviews and did love the food. My son now says forbidden black rice is THE thing for risotto. I had the Wellington empanadas. We shared bites and were impressed with both dishes. We wisely saved room to share the bourbon brownie with brown butter bacon ice cream; the flavors blended exquisitely.   A bit expensive for lunch, but well worth it.",

I would definitely come back to vegas just to eat this again!  *****  The next two plates came out and although the jalapeno poppers were good, major kudos to the rainbow cauliflower. A great mix of vinegar and spice; makes me think of pickled cauliflower with a kick, but grilled with a light char at the same time.  One of the best eating experiences I have had in the last year!

Would've been glad to pay more for larger portions, but maybe because the place felt more like a hipster hang out is why the menu was done this way.  Still a solid location and would recommend.",

The chicken skins are served with a honey to dip them in, and the salty sweet combo is just what I wanted. We also tried the bacon jam, which was a little to sweet for me (I was picturing more smoky/salty), but it was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone at our table. Our meal was DELISH, and the service was perfect. Make sure to try the Rainbow Cauliflower, and the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding.  I had the Bourbon Brownie and Browned Butter Bacon ice cream.  The brownie had the texture of a chocolate bar, rather than a brownie, and the bourbon was truly present - almost overwhelming, but the ice cream was great.   All of the drinks on their menu use really obscure liquors, which I guess makes them a little more pricey. They do have a full bar, though.   I would definitely recommend this place, and can't wait to go back.",

While the creativity and innovation gets high marks, not all variations hit the spot. The staff is very attentive and helpful and the service was fast.

On a Sunday night all of the menu items I was interested in were out. The Sea Bass, NY strip Steak, and Pork Chop. That is the entire Meat and Sea food section. I asked if I could get the pork belly flat bread without the Pickled Figs and the chef refused to do so. Not much of a problem if i was explained as to the reason. Instead the waiter told me that he begged the chefs to remove the pickled figs, but they were insulted and couldn't do it. Very disappointed. Also be aware of small portions and a hefty price tag for what they are delivering. The rest of my party enjoyed their meal, maybe i caught them on a bad night.  Either way, i will not return or suggest this restaurant. Thank you to our waiter who did try his best for us.",

    "text": "UPDATE TO PREVIOUS REVIEW:  First off, I went to this establishment but was unable to eat here.  I've spoken with the owner since my original review and there was a misunderstanding over the phone. We were expecting a table when we got there. Had we understood that that it would be such a long wait (45 min), we would have opted for a different restaurant.  I'm changing my review from 1 star to 2 because I did not have a good experience here as I was disappointed by the service / communication here as we waited in the restaurant. I've been to other restaurant that do those things better. Their phone service is very good.  As per my previous review, I probably caught them on an off night. If I dine here again when I return to Vegas, I'll update my review.    OLD REVIEW: I was really excited to try this place out last Tuesday. I called them up to see if a table was available for a party of 3. I spoke with Matt who said one would be available in around 20 minutes. He put our name on the list and he advised us not to park in the lot across the street so we parked in the Container Park lot and paid $10 to do so.   We made it to the restaurant 20 minutes later hungry and expecting a table. The girl at the front counter greeted us and informed us a table wasn't ready yet but would be soon as we were one of the next 2 in line. We understood and waited our turn.    We kept checking back in but she kept giving us the same story. It was very cramped inside as we waited so we spent a little time outside waiting where there were wind gusts up to 50mph.   After waiting 45 minutes, they gave our table to a larger party and she told us to continue to wait. I'm sure we caught them on an off night but the experience at the restaurant sucked and I cannot recommend them and don't think I'd ever come back, which is too bad because the food and atmosphere looked promising.",

We noticed how beautiful the restaurant was, friendly staff, and just a feel good ambience about the whole place. Today we ordered the Fried chicken skins (a little overcooked) but still was a good appetizer, the macaroni and cheese (definitely in my top five when it comes to mac & cheese) & we had the steak $19. Steak was great you could cut it with a butter knife, and I did. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the pictures are deceitful! The portions looked huge in the pictures, but are not. I seen someone eating a burger & that was huge. I wished I've gotten that instead, because everything I ordered I was still hungry when I left. Carson's is the kind of place you come to on a 1st date, and when you're not trying to have a heavy belly. Would I come again... Hell yea! I just know now that the things I ordered are not for sharing. Order your on damn Mac & cheese.",

We sat on the roof deck which is great during summer nights. (I know it's winter while I post this review so sorry) the view of Downtown was really nice. We tried the bacon jam (Yum!) and Gyro Tacos (also yum!) to start. The table next to us ordered the crispy chicken skins which looked amazing, so we have to try that. We also tried the Baked Mac & Cheese which was rich and super de-lish. For dessert, we ordered the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding, which was okay. I mean the flavor was there, but I am not too much of a fan of O-Face donuts. They are a little too dense for my liking. We also tried the Bourbon Fudge Brownie that was served along Brown Butter Bacon ice cream. That was delightful! So good.  Can't wait to try more next time.",

I recommend the bacon jam if you have a larger group of people than two or can take it to go. Since we were staying at a hotel room with no fridge, we sadly had to kiss our bacon jam goodbye. The turkey burger was great! I eat a lot of turkey burgers, and rarely are they that juicy and flavorful. My husband thought it was too fennel tasting, but I had absolutely no issue. It came with some crunchy tarot tots that were nice and dry, not oily at all.   Wait staff was good. decorations are fun. Communal tables are a bit different, but we made friends! I would definitely try this place again. If you are staying near Fremont street experience, do yourself a favor and venture a few blocks off the path. Good stuff!",

The fried chicken skins were good but not the best I've had, the skins were just a little denser than the ones they served at 595 craft.  The honey with the chicken skins definitely worked though.  The charred octopus was very tender, I just wish there was more octopus and less potatoes.  The aioli that paired with the octopus was a little too lemony for my taste.  We also got the new york strip which was impressive, the coffee flavors and the red wine made a great pairing.  We went to Gordon Ramsay steak the night before....and the NY strip was possibly better than the Wellington there in terms of tenderness of the meat and flavor.  We also got the mushroom flat bread which was executed well but maybe a touch under seasoned for me.  The black rice oxtail risotto and the mac and cheese were also excellent for carb options.  We tried two desserts the bourbon brownie and the bread pudding donut.  The bread pudding donut we couldn't stop eating.  We left behind half of the bourbon brownie, it was more like fudge, so super dense and heavy with bourbon flavor.  Overall, solid meal and I would definitely come back. FYI don't bring kids here that need a high chair, they don't have one.",

I added another star for the obvious (and it is obvious) effort the owner is putting into customer satisfaction.  Local old fart here - I found this place to be more \"hip-to-the-skip\" than a restaurant with substance. The food is overpriced for the uniqueness it's trying hard to achieve. Granted, I only ate here once during lunch...ordered the Pig & Fig, but I found the entire experience to be \"meh\". The balance of flavors was off in a potentially delicious fare - the sweetness of the fig overpowered the pork and goat cheese. Staff was friendly enough yet it felt superficial.

My party was going to be comprised of people who would find the stools very challenging and/or uncomfortable due to health reasons and having different physical needs.  I discussed this with the hostess and she was very clearly annoyed with me that I was being so specific in the type of seating we would need.  Once my party had arrived we tried to look at some other seating options but they would still be very challenging.  I was very frustrated because the seating at this restaurant felt discriminatory and the hostess was unwelcoming.  So unwelcoming I would describe the her as cold and hostile.  I finally asked for other restaurant recommendations and her boss gave us a suggestion - Eureka where the food was not nearly as good (I am guessing) but to be treated as if they actually wanted us in their restaurant or respected us as people was a huge relief after our terrible experience with Carson Kitchen.",

I wandered in here for a few bites before meeting up with some friends for a birthday party, sadly this was third time in Carson Kitchen, but my first time actually the eating food.   I went with the Gyro Tacos, the Wild Mushroom Flatbread and, \"A Drink With The Ms.\" to wash it all down. Carson Kitchen killed it on all fronts; the tacos were surprisingly light and very fresh, with the Mediterranean flavors really shining through and the Wild Mushroom Flatbread was a flavor bomb accented with a flaky crust that was to die for. These are both great options if you just plan on snacking at the bar before heading into Downtown Las Vegas.   \"A Drink With The Ms.\", isn't a quote from a \"Mad Men\" episode, but a solid Whiskey cocktail with a very sweet finish. The sweetness comes from the maple syrup and ginger beer that's mixed with a hefty pour of whiskey. This cocktail was on the verge of being too sweet, but the salty food I was eating kept everything at the perfect balance.   Carson Kitchen left my palate wanting more and like most people, nowadays my hunger controls my schedule. Carson Kitchen - 1, Nate - 0.",

First of all they serve Brooklyn Lager and Maui Bikini Blonde that's a point or two right there but if you think I came all the way from Brooklyn to have a Brooklyn Lager you might be.....wrong!  I was in town for business and had the monkeys with me they always find me when I'm on the West Coast dad had the short rib grilled cheese with gouda and mom monkey had the flatbread...me and mom share our food dad always seems to get the ribs he's figured out it's hard as hell to share that plate so he won't have our fingers all over his dinner!  We started with the tempura green bean's it comes served with a pepper jelly cream cheese you want to start with that dish! I ordered the jerk turkey with mango chutney slaw and it was delicious probably one of the best turkey burgers I've had!  Carson Kitchen is one of a few really good dining experiences populating the downtown freemont experience area they've got about four or five craft breweries and gastropubs there to slowly make it the place to dine and drink, grab your monkeys and go!",

The unique menu items made this one of the first stops on our list. We went on a Monday afternoon so we parked right in front of the restaurant, and we didn't have to wait for a table. We started out with crispy chicken skins and hot oysters. Both were great. They were actually the stars for me. For my entree, I had the butter burger and tater tots. Just average. I actually sent it back for them to melt the cheese. The cheese was very cold and hard and was not warming up even though it was on top of the meat. My friend had the black rice and oxtail risotto as an entree, and it was phenomenal. Definitely try this dish.",

My beer and the appetizers came out quick, but the waitress forgot my wife's drink.  However, they balanced it out by serving my wife's entree without my burger.  Wife ate, waitress claimed mine was coming in a few minutes.  After 20 minutes, I had counted 7 burgers had been served, but not mine.  Flagged the waitress, told her to cancel it and left hungry.   $50 and a wasted chunk of my evening with barely 2 schitz given by the staff.  It's also really loud and the chairs are all backless stools at normal height tables making sitting there waiting for nothing a ridiculously uncomfortable experience.",

I know plenty of restaurant managers on and off the strip but never have I been so offended by the manager that worked that evening.  It was slow evening when we arrived and were offered a table for 3 but our 3rd flaked out. Either way we're we're served well, except for the fact my lady noticed the manager continuously stare at us from afar. He finally came up to us and asked if our guest was going to arrive. As soon as we said no, he grabbed the napkins and place settings with such a bad attitude and walked away without a word.   We had our meals but we're still annoyed and Mike kept leering at us. Finally, we got our check and we're about to pay when he, grabbed the check out of our servers hands. He came back and stated, \"I took care of the appetizer, thanks for understanding and we needed you to get up quickly!\"   Wtf? Like really? You could of kindly asked us to sit at the bar or another small table, and we would have been good but the way the manager Mike, handled himself was completely unprofessional, offensive, and rude as fuck.   I will return, as long as he's not managing others with a bad attitude, giving patron rude leers and pushing them out the door.",

Went out for lunch with my co-workers and got the Short Rib Grilled Cheese served with Spicy Tater Tots and the Green Beans for an appetizer. Keep in mind that your food does not come out at the same time, it comes as it is prepared or at least that's what they told us. In our case, our Green Beans \"appetizer\" didn't come out until we were almost done with our entree. The Short Rib Grilled Cheese was probably one of the worst I had, the bread was burnt and over toasted and the short rib itself was dry and lacked flavor. The Tater Tots again were overdone, I mean it was more than extra crispy. Then comes the late \"appetizer\". It was nothing appetizing, came out full of grease and extra salty. I don't know if they were having an off day but for the price and quality of the food, I will not be back.",

A big group of us were exploring Fremont Street so we decided to stop by here based on Yelp reviews. I didn't realize it was such a small and intimate restaurant. We were escorted on their outside lawn which is filled with lawn chairs and some tables while the waiter asked the owner if there would be seating available for us. We were wondering if we could sit outside and eat but someone from Carson Kitchen came out and told us that he could split our party up and accommodate our large party as long as we finish by a certain time due to a reservation. We all agreed but then he said that they couldn't split checks. The could only split in groups of 3's. My friend asked why and the he simply stated \"because it's our policy.\" My friend was curious and asked again why is this the policy since they could obviously split checks but it could only be done in 3's, he replied again in a rude tone \"because it's our policy.\" I think we all would have agreed even with this interesting 'policy' but we were just wondering why. We were here for a conference so we needed our receipts to be itemized and separate. We did not need someone from the staff to be rude to prospective customers. I'm sure the food is great, but this man needed an attitude check if he thinks he's the reason for the success of this restaurant. We ended up leaving through the back, we didn't need someone to be so condescending to us. Sad I missed out on what seems to be an amazing food experience but we as a group felt like we were disrespected.  The owner contacted me after my review and was extremely apologetic about this situation. I hope this issue will be resolved so that others won't have the same experience we did. The owner also invited us back to actually enjoy the food. I'll be sure to come back with a smaller party the next time I'm in Vegas.",

Our hostess (I think her name was Danielle?) gave us the best seats in the house right in front of the grill so we could see all the food come out.  We ordered four plates and they were all amazing.  Dakota and Bridget were excellent and attentive servers, just the right amount of checking in without being overbearing.  Gyro tacos- perfectly cooked and the meat was delicious  Macaroni and cheese- you must order this.  Just trust me.  Burnt ends- we are from an area where BBQ is taken very seriously.  These were on par with a good BBQ restaurant back home.  Deviled eggs- reminds you of childhood.  Yum!  To make a long story short, this place is worth every penny and the wait!",

Which, we had to flag a server down, no one came to check on us.  It took another 15 for that to come out...they did comp our burger. However, the mediocre food didn't make up for the service.",

Always made sure we had full drinks, coursed out our food timely, and made great recommendations on what to order.  We had a variety of items.  Fried green beans were delicious.  Young beet salad, not my fancy, but tasty. I'm not a fan of beets, personal preference, but I still enjoyed it.  Oxtail risotto, something new for me, but delicious.  Bacon jam was a bit sweeter than I had expected, but good.  It could use a bit more baked brie in it than they currently use to prepare the dish.  All dishes are made to share, so if you aren't keen on that, might not be a good place to go for just the two of you.  Group dining is the best way to go.",

That definitely hit the spot being so hot outside having some cold orange cream soda. I will be back there again. Maybe expand my horizons a bit on the menu.",

    "text": "Experience:  I have been waiting and waiting to try this place. I kept missing the nights out when my friends were going. So, here I am with about a group of 7.   Facility:  the inside is very small, but it was a beautiful Vegas night, so we sat on the balcony.  Was quite a walk around for the elevator, but stairs are easy access. The balcony seems to have more room, but it might be because it's open air. Upstairs has some bench seating and chairs.   Service: when I first walked in, I asked how to get to the balcony and a very nice lady (Suzanne) walked me all the way around to the elevator and up to the top. Our waiter (Roman) was friendly, attentive and accommodating.   Food:  wow!  So, we ordered a bunch of dishes to share.  Seems like most portions are on the small side.  Here's what we had: Gyro tacos - 4/5 - very good. Crispy \"shell\" made from pita, very good tzatziki and good lamb. Crispy chicken skins - 5/5 - crispy, slightly spiced skins almost cooked like pork skins, and served with honey for dipping.  The perfect blend of salty/savory and sweet.  Bacon Jam - 5/5 - the bread was perfectly toasted and the jam was sweet and delicious with a hint of bacon. Brie was kinda unnecessary, because the jam overpowers it.  Devils eggs - 4/5 - good flavors of egg, caviar and pancetta.  Cheddar crab fondue - 3/5 - good flavor, but almost tasted like canned crab. But I still liked it.  Mac and cheese - 4/5 - good, cheesey, but a tad runny.  Glazed Donut bread pudding - 3/5 - if you like sweet donut flavor - yum! Good flavors, but waaaayyyy too sweet for me.  Bacon Ice Cream - 5/5 - the yummiest!  Ice cream with bits of bacon.   Overall - this is now my favorite restaurant downtown.  I loved it!  The atmosphere, the service, and, of course, the food. I'll be back!!!!",

Gyro tacos, flatbread, snapper, bacon jam, green beans... really could list more. Delicious. Cocktails and dessert yummy and different as well. Outstanding! Wish you guys were in Austin!",

The menu is meant for family style, so they encourage sharing which is great for trying a lot of different dishes. Waiters were very attentive and great with suggestions. Didn't have room for the Mac'n'Cheese and this is not normally my dish, but it looked great and we'll be coming back to try it  It was a little cold outside so we opted to sit inside, which was awesome as the environment is groovy. BUT, definitely going back when it's a little warmer to sit outside upstairs, a great, fun space.  If you're not sure - GO, you enjoy it.  Also, Apple Pay. Love it.",

So glad vegas is getting a nice set of solid places that cater more to locals who want a night out that isn't in a hotel or Summerlin.   Walking in the hostess was in a tye dye grateful dead shirt and the waiter in a Led Zeppelin shirt. For a trendy place like this we were very confused. Im assuming the waiter gets that look often as he quickly explained to us that when they bought their alcohol permit it states that the bar is to be a 'rock bar' where they are required to play 'rock music' and have 'rock attire' he even took the license off the wall to show us. Very funny.  The food was outstanding. I've never been a place where every single dish was mouth watering good. The place is tapas style so we got quite a few plates. Chicken skins with honey is quite possibly the best thing I have ever tasted. I was apprehensive about ordering as it sounds weird but do not skip over it you will regret it if you do. We also had the tempura green beans with aioli. cauliflower mix, steak, bang bang shrimp and truffle  mac and cheese. ALL dishes were worth writing home about. Perfect amount of food for the four of us. Already planning my next trip to vegas and making sure I make time to stop back in.  PRO TIP: Mac and cheese is hidden under the salad section in the menu ;)",

The food- amazing!!! Far exceeded my expectations. We started with the gyro tacos- so tasty, so delicious. Then we had the tomato stack, broccoli crunch, chicken thighs, short rib sliders, and the turkey burger. ALL EXCELLENT. Not one mediocre item. We shared the bread pudding for desert.. Again- delectable. I cannot wait to go back- and bring my family and friends who haven't been.. Downtown Vegas just keeps getting better- and Carson Kitchen is the perfect addition! A gem.",

I went with three other people and we ordered a bunch of things and shared.  We got the tempura green beans, jalapeno poppers, crispy chicken skins, baked mac n cheese, bacon jam, devil's eggs, and the chili cheese dog flatbread.  I think that covers it... everything was excellent and the standout for me was the tempura green beans.  Everyone in my group had a different favorite, though.  The crispy chicken skins were also awesome, but definitely needs to be shared between a few people.  I loved our server as well.  He was so nice and helpful.  The place seems very tiny for what I'm used to seeing in Vegas, maybe like 10 tables altogether plus seating at the bar?  We arrived at 3pm so it was kind of an off hour and we were seated right away.  I can imagine with how delicious the food is that there might be a bit of a wait at times during more normal dinner time hours.  The kitchen is open so you can see the chefs at work.  No secrets here!  The only bad thing I have to say is that one staff member who appeared to be a manager of sorts was kind of a dick.  We had requested some more bread for the bacon jam from our server and this manager guy was the one to bring it over.  He kind of flopped it on the table and said \"bread\" with a grimace and walked away.  I've had a couple friends who have also eaten here recently share about similar encounters.  Not sure what his problem is, but the rest of this place is redeeming enough that I would still come back and give it a 5 star review.",

Such a small place inside, last time we had to leave because of such a long wait for a tiny dinning room. But we came back and it was well worth it!!! I love the open kitchen concept, from where we sat we watched the whole operation run (pretty cool!!) So we started with the bacon jam app, it was so tasty and addicting. But the heat will catch up on you, but managable. The flavors in it are perfectly balanced, a must try!!! Then we shared the cocoa steak with Mac and cheese. Both were wonderful and the Mac and cheese I believe has truffle. And for dessert we got the bourbon brownie. I thought the plating was a little awkward but looked nice, just not exactly practical to dig into. The desert was sooo rich!! Good, but so sweet we couldn't finish it. The candied bacon was interesting and we enjoying the ice cream. We'll defiantly be back! :)",

We had a party of five and we were able to try about 3/4 of the small plates menu plus a couple of the sandwiches and 2 bottles of red wine. Got out of there for  $300 including tip. Best meal we have had this trip to Vegas. Highlights were the bacon jam, crispy chicken skin, gyro tacos, devils eggs....the mac and cheese was the best I have had anywhere, the strip steak was a revelation, short-rib stroganoff was amazing, the beet salad was also good with the beets not too mushy or too pickled. Every dish we had was perfectly seasoned and balanced. We had the donut bread pudding for dessert and i was wishing I had ordered one of my own so I wouldn't have to share. I wish I could transplant this place to spokane so we could go all the time. Service was friendly, fun and helpful. It seemed like our server likes his job and was happy to be there which is really nice.  We had a local with us that had never heard of the place, she will be taking her friends there to show off her new gem. We will go again when we are in town next.  Love, love, love!",

Our server Kirsten was attentive, very knowledgeable about their dishes, too.  She made us feel comfortable--never rushed, even took pix of us LOL.  The spicy rabbit ragu over spaghetti squash is great, especially if you're living primal and so were the lemony-kissed veal meatballs.  Had to try the beet and pistachio salad since we were up at the counter and could watch them being prepped.  The food presentation is gorgeous and the food was flavorful (and if you've seen my other reviews, you know I really appreciate \"pretty\" and scrumptious food)--a feast for the eyes and palate.  So what are you waiting for?  Check it out!  (If you can find it, no signage above the door, but it was part of the adventure.) Go early or at an \"off\" time because by the time we left, there were crowds at the door.",

We went back inside after an hour to see where in the list we were.  The \"list\" had been completely rewritten since our arrival so we couldn't verify this was happening, however, two groups said this and it seems suspicious that the wait list was rewritten.

My boyfriend got a couple beers and I tried on of the signature cocktails (which was delicious!). I should've written this review when it was still fresh in my head since I don't remember the name of the cocktail. We decided to order a bunch of dishes to share. We got the fingerling potatoes which were cooked and seasoned so perfectly. Then we got the gyro tacos which were filling and flavorful. I think the last thing we ordered was the short rib stroganof (however you spell it lol). All the food was delicious, the potatoes being both of our favorites. The bartender/waitress was really friendly and attentive and the overall ambiance of the place was very laidback and casual. I'm giving five stars for the quick friendly service, cool atmosphere, and the yummy food!",

I had a wonderful beet salad - which I will definitely have again - and \"Not Your Father's Twinkies\" for dessert. Kerry Simon is known for these twists on sweet American junk food so this play on Twinkies is in his wheel house. They are really moist and the mandarin oranges work well. But I felt it was lacking in cream and would be better if plated with a creme or pudding. Since the menu is new, I wanted to share my feedback and the maitre d' was really glad that I did. In fact, he agreed with me and encouraged us to come back  as they continue to perfect the menu. Solid experience overall.",

Was a little skeptical about how how it was going to be when seated at the bar near the kitchen, but quickly cooked down and was in for a treat watching the food prep by the staff. Our server was super sweet (yay for Bianca!) and she told my friend and I how most of the food is made for sharing since it all tends to come out at different times as it is ready. We went with the bacon jam for starters, and when it came out bubbling and looking like it would scald our mouths, we were glad to heed their advice am give it a minute to cool down if we wanted to taste any of the rest of our meal. Bacon jam was really good, but I would have been content with only a bite or two due to richness and salt factor. I got the FGT sliders, (fried green tomato) with crab salad on top and spicy tots. It was so delicious, but tots were way over seasoned so I only had a few of those. My friend got the Mac and cheese, which was cheesy goodness, but pools of oil were evident like a minute after it came out so she only ate half. This amount of food was waaay more than we could finish, and was sad to not have a fridge in our hotel room to enjoy later in our stay.  Would definitely return. Over all for 3 plates and a coke it was $50, so a bit pricey, but fun for the show of watching the dishes being made, and really liked our server Bianca!",

I have to tell you though we went today at lunch and I think we were exceedingly lucky that we walked in and were able to sit at a table. There was one table that was being saved for somebody with reservations and everything else was literally full it is a tiny little spot. But it is fantastic. We started with the Wellington empanadas which was fantastic.  We then ordered the fried green tomato sandwich with crab and the short rib sliders both came with spicy tater tots. The tater tots were not too spicy you could definitely detect some Paprika and they were quite good. The short rib sliders were quite sweet. The menu does say that they are root beer short rib sliders so take note of that because they are sweet. But the slider was fantastic the sweetness was offset by a crispy onion that was put on the slider. If I had one note it would be to put a little bit more crispy onion to offset that sweetness. The fried green tomato sandwich with crab was the star the tomato is very thickly cut and expertly breaded. The breading has a nice spice to it. Overall it was a fantastic meal it's a little pricey for lunch but I think you have to look at what you get and then you understand the $40 price tag for two people at lunch.  I would love to go back, I hope I get lucky again and get a table!!!",

A great way to meet and talk with fellow diners if you feel like being social, but still plenty of space if you're not feeling it. We had the Crispy Chicken Skins with roasted honey (a MUST have) to start. For our entrees we chose the Swordfish and NY Strip Steak. The steak was cooked PERFECTLY and the red wine demi sauce added to without overpowering the natural flavor of the meat. The swordfish with lemon, mint & basil was FANTASTIC!! We also had the baked mac & cheese (unsolicited compliments of the house due to the wait time for our entrees). I highly recommend Carson Kitchen and will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu. Bacon Jam, Chicken Thighs and Roasted Beets are on the list for our next visit.",

    "text": "This restaurant in downtown Vegas was a great find. It's in a small space - kitchen on one side and the bar on the other with counter seats around them plus 4 tables fronting big windows and a communal table for 6. Service was friendly and helpful. The red pale, Las Vegas lager, and milk stout were all good. Food was delicious. The social plates we tried: crispy chicken skins, tomato bisque, young beets, and Rainbow cauliflower were all yummy; the Bloody Caesar was the least impressive however. The poached pear pomegranate added sweetness and moisture to the pork chop. Our consensus was that the thick juicy and tasty butter burger was the best. Even the background music provided great listening.",

    "text": "This place was good. Everything we had was very tasty. Everyone working here is really nice. So why only a 3 stars A-OK experience?  It's a food running, kitchen execution issue. We were sitting at the bar where we could openly see everything that was happening in the kitchen. My friend ordered sliders with fries and I ordered Mac n Cheese.   Usually at a sit down restaurants where you're paying over $10 a plate, the food comes more or less at around the same time. The sliders came first. Waited 5 minutes, then the server came to ask how everything was. IThis was strange since they could see that I hadn't gotten my dish yet.  After a little while, Mac n Cheese materialized on the pass, but no one was around to run the food to the table. The Sous chef hit the bell to call for a runner, but no one came. It didn't seem like it was a big priority that no one was running the dish that they had just taken the time to create. There's nothing more frustrating to see your food prepared and ready to be served, but no one is around to bring it to you. And it wasn't that anyone was slacking, everyone was actually busy at tables.   I think the food sat there for a good 3-4 minutes before a Manager came by. The Manager ran the food to us, put the Mac and Cheese down on the other side of my friend from where I was sitting. Obviously the plate was for me but even so.. This problem can be avoided with a simple seat number system when the server takes the order.  Just some constructive criticism. I hope they rethink this side of the service and staff some runners or serving assistants and when I'm back again sometime, I hope to have an above and beyond experience.",

At some point you have to ask yourself: is there anything I ate that I would crave some random Wednesday night?  And we didn't feel that about anything we had.  For the record we ordered: crispy chicken skin, deviled egg with caviar and pancetta, grilled artichoke, beet salad, and oxtail risotto.    I try not to judge on service or ambiance too much, in the end if the food is amazing you'll go back.  But  I'm not a fan on shared seating (one long table with other people crowded around you); prefer some privacy for conversations and I hate the feeling of eavesdropping on the person sitting 1ft away from you.",

    "text": "I don't recommend this place if you are a vegetarian or health conscious.  (And neither does the restaurant represent itself as being vegetarian or health friendly.)  The bacon jam tasted good but visually was not appealing due to its blackish color (and even a little gross because it was marinating in its fat).  The lamb in the gyros were dried out, so much so that even the yogurt sauce didn't cover up the dryness. The pita bread was moist and tasty though, and I have to wonder whether this would do better as a vegetarian dish.  The two dishes I really enjoyed were the Cuban (although did it really need to be pork belly?) and the mac and cheese. Both were flavorful and moist.  However, I can't in good conscious give more than 3 stars since this was only half the dishes, and I can't imagine the calories cost to achieve those flavors.  I can't ignore that the mac and cheese probably was a very fattening dish (so much so that one of my fellow diners could not finish the small dish). I can't ignore that the Cuban had 2 very thick slices of cheese on 2 buttered slices of toast. Just because I choose to eat out doesn't mean I want to eat a more than 1000 calorie meal. If I wanted that, I'd have gone to Heart Attack down the street.  (Review edited for accuracy after being contacted by the business owner.)",

It is off the beaten path closer to downtown, but totally worth stumbling off the strip.   The decor is very chic but simple. It sort of feels like you're dining in the chefs private residence with family/bar style seating and the open concept kitchen. The details in the decor are very cool and inviting.   Now to the food - it was to die for! We had the mushroom flatbread which was so unique with arugula, feta and a butternut squash paste base. The flavors mixed so well on a crispy crust. Then the Mac and Cheese...so many places can screw it up by being just \"meh\" or bland, but this Mac was seriously legit. We finished it off with the bread pudding made from donuts - I would cut it with some salt or acidity, but it was still delish.  Go to this restaurant right now.",

I mean can it be any more salty and burnt?  The Hamburger (I was so looking forward to this).... is not really there (Bun and toppings) Must say the meat is tender. Its just missing a little more toasted on the entire Hamburger.   Overall its  good place in a really cool location. Looking forward to what will be around that isolated area.

    "text": "The food and service here is delicious and straight to the point! I can't rave enough on what an incredible dining experience we had here. Another yelper commented on how the restaurant and ambiance reminded them of being in San Francisco and I agree. I definitely didn't feel like I was in Vegas anymore. I loved the restaurant's quaint and modern design but I especially enjoyed the charming ambiance on their roof top dining area, the booths were very comfortable and there was just the right amount of lighting too.    Now, let's get to the good stuff: the food!    The crispy chicken skins arrived with a side of smoked honey for dipping = insane! Honey Boo Boo, this thing is real good! The skins were seasoned expertly and fried to crazy, crispy perfection; I couldn't get enough of that airy, crunchy skin - it wasn't even oily. Don't even get me started on the smoked honey -delectable- you can bet your sweet life they were meant to be eaten together. It's a must-order and for $6, the portion was perfect for two.   We also went all in on the bacon jam with baked brie and grilled baguette at $12, It's the most popular item on the menu and now I know why. It came out bubbling hot and was incredibly bacon-y, jam-y, brie-y, salty, sweet and, yes, it was pretty darn magical.   To offset the naughtiness that is crispy chicken skins and bacon jam, we also ordered roasted young beets with pistachio, mandarin orange slices and goat cheese at $8. The beets were roasted till perfect tenderness, naturally sweet, and the dish was simple but very tasty. It was the perfect option to complement the richness of the bacon jam.   We also grabbed an order of the black rice and oxtail risotto with Parmesan cream for $14, though, we thought it was way too cheesy (if that's even a problem?) Based on the menu description, we were expecting more of a smoother Parmesan cream-like consistency, but we ended up with more of a dense, stringy texture. Our waitress was wonderful and could tell that we weren't too thrilled with the consistency when she checked on us, so she generously offered to replace the dish with something else that we would be able to enjoy. We decided on the rabbit ragu with spaghetti squash and Parmesan at $12 - everything on this dish was seasoned very well; I also really enjoyed the light tomato cream sauce and the perfectly cooked spaghetti squash. Surprisingly, the overall dish wasn't too heavy. I personally wouldn't order it again, (rabbit is just not my thing) but my boyfriend went to town on it and really enjoyed it.    I'm completely satisfied with the level of service and care that we were offered here. They went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with everything we ordered, plus the simply tasty food is well worth a quick return! I can't wait to come back and order some more of those chicken skins all to myself!",

The pickled red onions really made the dish. Next, we shared the short rib grilled cheese. Meat was tender and flavorful. Cheese mixed well with the crusty sourdough bread. Side of spicy tots worked too. For dessert, we got the glazed donut bread pudding. Yes, you read that correctly. Glazed. Donut. Bread. Pudding. It was excellent.

    "text": "Good things first:  -Food was DELICIOUS! We loved everything we ate. Tempura green beans were super yum, I could have eaten another entire platter of them especially with that cream cheese pepper jam dipping sauce. I had the short rib sliders and they were delectable with a nice sweetness to the meat. My husband, a vegetarian, had the fried green tomato sandwich and loved it.  -Service was terrific! Our server was attentive, funny, and helpful. I was never without water. Great experience there.  -Prices were very reasonable for the quality of food. And our portion sizes were great. I left STUFFED.   Now a few bad, which is the only reason I've taken off one star: -The seating is terribly uncomfortable. We were seated at the communal table with high wooden chairs. The seats of the chairs just aren't quite long enough so they cut me off at mid-thigh, painfully. Also, there is a poured concrete \"step\" around the table. I'm thinking this was for you to rest your feet on, but it's not high enough for my legs to reach, so was pointless. I still had to rest my legs on my chair. I am 5'7\". Also, the concrete slab makes it impossible to pull your chair all the way in to the table, making me just a bit too far away to sit and eat without having to lean in. Awkward.  -I ordered a \"microbrew\" soda, they have a few on the menu, and I was excited to try Dr. Better. It was served to me with the bottle and a glass of ice. Great, except the bottle was warm. Not like only-recently-placed-in-the-refrigerator-to-chill warm. It was HOT like it was sitting in a non-air conditioned storeroom. My friend's soda was also served to him in a warm bottle. It was unfortunate because the flavor of the soda was diluted by pouring it warm over the ice. Why would they not serve it chilled? Do they not have a room for a soda refrigerator? It struck me as strange. And irritating.  -It was really loud in there. The music wasn't loud, but all those folks talking in such a small space made for a noisy noisy dining experience. It was hard to have a conversation between just me, my husband, and our friend. Oh well.   Overall though, we will definitely be back because the food and service was great and there are other things I want to try. I will however try to grin and bear it while sitting on their uncomfortable seats, not bother ordering a soda again, and will forgo conversation and just focus on eating!",

    "text": "\"Service Dogs\" in the dining room   Carson Kitchen was a pleasant surprise. After we walked around the block a couple times trying to find the entrance (it's a little confusing) we were promptly seated by the window for a party of 3. We were entertaining our friend from out of town and had just come from the Mob Museum (highly recommended). The place was packed, so we were delighted to be seated quickly.   Our server was very friendly and helpful. He suggested a few dishes and was spot on. The plates are small portions, like tapas. They are shareable. We ordered green beans and a wonderful, tender steak. It was amazing! The guys each had a domestic beer, but I ordered a cider based on the server's recommendation. I forget the name (I'll add the name later when I find it). It was an imported cider from Swizterland. Wonderful and refreshing! The atmosphere is a modern, trendy pub with unique artwork. Very hipster.   We loved Carson Kitchen, but unfortunately they lost tons of points with me after I saw dogs laying around in the dining room. Yes, DOGS! LIVE DOGS!!! This disgusted me and I couldn't help, but think there was dog hair in my food.    I've since have discussed this with the owner who tells me he only allows service dogs in. Although, there isn't a lot of regulations on how to determined whether a dog is a service dog or not. He has assured me he has trained his staff and looked into the legal requirements. It turns out the owners of the dogs do not have to provide any proof. Just about anyone can walk in with a dog and say it's a service dog. It most likely was service dogs we saw that night.   I can understand business owners delimma. If they question whether a dog is a service dog they run the risk of offending the owner. If they refuse to let them in the risk a lawsuit. When they do let them in other customers, such as myself, are turned off. I've also learned most service dogs are used for depression and anxiety, not physical disabilities. There seems to be a lot more \"service dogs\" around. I'm seeing dogs in hair and nail salons, restaurants, and I even saw one in a Target that had a grocery section!   If I do return to Carson Kitchen and there happens to be dogs in the dining room I will choose to go elsewhere.",

We also tried the mushroom flatbread, green beans, and gyro tacos, all which were wonderful! Dipping sauce for the green beans was great, big chunks of cream cheese mixed with some sort of chili sauce. Our server, Brittany, made excellent recommendations and was super personable!

How disgusting to take something back into your kitchen and put on your grill something that customers have touched. If they did that with us, what other unsanitary practices are the allowing.

The bacon jam was good as well but we wouldn't order it again with so many other options to choose from.

Not expensive but not low to medium priced as the reviews show.  Maybe it is more a case enjoying my time and continuing to eat!  I would call Carson Kitchen large tapas bistro style.  The caprese was very nice and tomatoes were good even though they were closer to commissary than the local farm.  The rabbit ragu with spaghetti squash was excellent!  The coffee crusted NY strip was very flavorful but in a town known for beef it would benefit from using aged beef.    Overall, I would definitely go back!",

I am a personal chef and I love dining out and getting new ideas to add to my menu's which I offer up to my clients. My favorite item we ordered was the bacon jam with brie. OMG. Cory, one of the owners was kind enough to share the recipe with our group. I am going to attempt to make this at my holiday party. HOLY COW. It was fantastic. I also loved the deviled eggs (the pancetta and the caviar were a wonderful touch), the veal meatballs with  cream sauce, and the chicken skins with a yummy honey dip. We had several other wonderufl dishes but these particular ones stood out. My martini was made to perfection. The atmosphere of this place reminded me of places where I used to hang out in Seattle. VERY cool vibe, and VERY busy. We had great service and overall had a really nice evening.  I can't wait to go back and bring my friends. Thank you Cory for a memorable evening at Carson Kitchen!",

Everything here is prepared with love.  I had the jalapeno poppers and they were perfect.   Crunchy on the outside and cheesy bacony on the inside.   I also had the daily special which was halibut wrapped in pancetta! They need to add it to their menu.  The halibut was perfectly cooked and so delicious!! My boyfriend had the bison sliders. Wow.  Those things were so moist and delicious!!! Our other friend had steak and let me try it.  Melted in my mouth!! We topped it all off with some bourbon chocolate cake with ice cream.   The ice cream appears to have bacon inside. That's a whole lotta good there.   Cocktails are great too and not too expensive if you just order a call drink like a cape cod instead of ordering off their fancy drink menu.    Wait time they quoted us 1 hour I was more like 20 minutes.   Ambiance is beautiful.   Will definitely come every time I am in Vegas.",

I ordered the Crispy Chicken Skins $9.00 with smoked honey, Killer Shrimp with rocoto pepper cream $11.00, Bacon Jam with baked brie, toasted baguette slices $12.00 and my son ordered Butter Burgerboursin, cheddar, lettuce, tomato with served with spicy tater tots $14.00.   The crispy chicken skins were okay to me but my son didn't like them.  The shrimp were breaded and lightly fried and then doused with this pepper cream, a little too spicy for me.  The bacon jam I didn't like but my son did.  I thought that the bacon jam was overpriced for what you got.  The one thing I did really like was the butter burger and then again the tater tots were a little on the too spicy side.  I also ordered a sangria which was average.  I think if you want to come here come here not hungry and order a drink and an appetizer and just enjoy the company and the ambiance.  It's a place where you come and bring a pre-date.  Plus the waiter was in a rush to get us out so someone else could sit down, I didn't care for that.  The round bowl dishes bothered me because when they brought food out in them the servers had their thumb in the bowl to hold it.  I would get different serving dishes instead of those bowls.",

Makes sense, it just wasn't my fav dish, but we ate it all. Feel like that dish needs some adjusting. There was a party of 3 behind me - they had a 45 min wait.. And there was a 17 year old with them so sitting at the bar was not an option. I told them to wait as it was well worth it, and there options on Fremont Street are not to be compared on all levels! Get here early to avoid a wait if you are hungry. The space is small - but functions, well. It was cold outside, so everyone was waiting inside, and I could feel the energy from the folks that wanted to get seated and eat. I could have stayed to enjoy another glass of wine, chat up with my friend, but felt bad for the hungry people, so we split.",

Carson Kitchen is a cozy, eclectic restaurant. My husband and I sat at the counter by the kitchen. It was fun watching all the activity. I'm big on atmosphere and this place scores five stars. Don't expect large portions. I ordered scallops, which were excellent, but the order only comes with three scallops for $17. Worth it, at least for me. I also had the strawberry salad. Very fresh like the scallops. Greens with strawberries, candied pecans, thinly sliced Parmesan cheese, and a strawberry vinaigrette. I asked for the dressing on the side because I wasn't sure I would like it, but it was good. Thick but tasty. My husband had the chicken thighs with spicy tater tots. He let me eat one tarot tot and it was delisch. He thought the chicken was ok. I had a little bit of his and thought it was juicy and good, but not spectacular. Then we had dessert - the banoffie pie. It was excellent. Graham cracker crust with Bailey's cream and bananas and a piece of chocolate biscotti. This is definitely a place for foodies. Oh, and I had two glasses is the Velvet Devil Merlot, which is one of my faves.",

Terrible curb appeal but once you get inside and see the open kitchen and well-designed interior, you'll instantly forget what it looks like from the outside.  I highly recommend the bacon jam and the rye/blueberry cocktail.   Chicken skins were really heavy (as expected) and the serving is really large. Barely got through 1/3 of the serving between 2 of us.   Would recommend this place to anyone visiting or living in Vegas.",

Once you're seated, they advise all the food comes out when it's ready individually. Different but cool! Don't let the small plates fool you, you'll definitely get full. We ordered the Mac n cheese, lamb tacos, veal meatballs and burnt ends. I'd have to say I enjoyed all the food but the burnt ends were my least favorite. The texture was a little too tough for my liking. We also ordered some cocktails. I ordered the Daaaaamn Daniel, and the Hubs ordered the Get Shorty. My drink was way too sour. I'm not sure if it was the cocktail itself or if it wasn't made right this one time? All the ingredients are things I like which sound like a win? Anyway I ended up sending the Daaaaamn Daniel back and switched to the Get Shorty which is spicy and salty which I loved! All in all we had a great night! My only complaints were the drinks took a long time to come out and the place is really loud. We'll definitely return!",

    "text": "The Skinny: okay - nothing special. Food was bland or very unbalanced(2), service: food came out quickly, only 2 servers in the whole joint made service slow(2), value: overpriced for so-so food and service(2 stars overall).  With the plethora of tapas joints out there, we were interested in trying out Kerry Simon's joint for some comfort/farm to table food.  Of note, they only had 2 servers manning the restaurant. Albeit the restaurant is small, they are able to squeeze quite a few customers on the bar stools (there are about 4 table seats in the restaurant with largely communal/bar seating). Given the number of customers/servers, this poor ratio resulted in slower than expected service.  We ordered the Broccoli Crunch ($8), the Wellington Empanadas ($10), Veal Meatballs in a Foie Gras Sherry Cream ($12) and the Sprouts and Spuds Hash($10). As per our server, she suggested about 2 dishes/person. Serving sizes are typical of a tapas type style restaurant - small.  The broccoli crunch was very bland. Slightly par-boiled to get the rawness out, the broccoli was dressed in a rather runny tasteless version of green goddess dressing. Even the addition of pumpkin/sunflower seeds could not save this dish. Sadly, this was the best dish of the night.  The Wellington Empanadas were again desperately underseasoned. The beef was tough and overcooked. The mushrooms were flavorless. The pastry itself was okay but that alone could not save this dish.  Veal meatballs were okay - nothing special. I would say there was a bit too much breadcrumb in the meatball itself. The selling point was the foie gras sherry cream which disappointed - did not taste the foie gras in the dish at all.  The Sprouts (Brussel) and Spuds (Potato) was overpowered by the rather large dose of balsamic vinegar to the dish. It was so strong that I started coughing due to the potency of the vinegar. It wasn't pleasant and I would definitely not recommend this dish.  After the lackluster dishes we were served, we skipped dessert here and went somewhere else. The level of the cuisine does not match the prices that they charge here.  Given the disappointing array of dishes and slow service makes this place a 2 starred joint.",

    "text": "Their address will tell you Carson Kitchen is located on 6th street, but you'll have to turn the corner onto Carson to find the entrance right next door to O Face Doughnuts. The lack of signage makes it difficult to find, but it's totally worth the search. I've tried two other Kerry Simon restaurants and wasn't wowed. This place, however, lives up to the hype.  The menu is full of small and large plates of  Simon's re-imagining of comfort food. Deviled eggs ($8) are refreshingly light on mayo, topped with crispy, meaty chunks of pancetta and caviar that adds a bit of salinity to the dish. The crispy chicken skins ($8) became more addictive with each bite and the bacon jam's ($12) smokey, sweet, and savory profile was hard to resist. A sizable portion for our party of three, we had to request more toasted baguettes to finish it up.  The rabbit ragu ($12) was a slight let down. The thin ragu had a slight kick to it, but the course texture of the squash had me wishing it was cooked longer. Another dish that failed to excite was the gyro tacos ($10). Familiar flavors weren't enough to make this dish stand out among all the others.   A slightly better dish, the Wellington empanada ($10) was filled with lightly seasoned beef tenderloin wrapped in a thick, flakey pastry shell. The sprouts and spuds hash ($10) was excellent and a great size for sharing. I was thrilled to see the sprouts and potatoes cooked to an almost burnt level with plenty of char and crispy edges. The last savory dish was the wild mushroom flatbread ($10). Showcasing a blistered crust topped with mushrooms, onions and cabrales bleu cheese, it was a solid dish with somewhat understated flavors complimenting each other.  With just enough room for dessert we started with the Not Your Father's Twinkies ($8). It was an underwhelming fried sponge cake with piped in filling and an orange coulis that added a little brightness and acidity, with a touch of basil that seemed like a mistake. The Glazed donut bread pudding ($8), on the other hand, was an excellent showcase in restrained sweetness. Ending the meal was the bourbon fudge brownie ($8) with brown butter bacon ice cream. Dense and rich, there's nothing fancy about this dish, just one that was well executed and sweet enough for any chocolate lover.  Heading back to his roots, chef Simon and team have created a restaurant that can already be considered one of the best Downtown and a spot that both tourists and locals should check out.",

Make sure to ask if there are any available seats on the second floor to enjoy being outside and a great ambiance!    Went here with a party of 8 and kind of did family style ordering off the \"Social Plates\" (meant to be shared, or as an appetizer) The Crispy Chicken Skins with Honey are unbelievably good! Our only complaint was that there were no other dipping sauces like ranch or blue cheese. I understand that the chef does not like altering the taste of his creations but a few people at our table could not eat the honey and it left them at a disadvantage. The waiter was very nice and helpful and explained that they do not carry ranch but offered a hot sauce similar to Frank's hot sauce that could be used as a dipping sauce so that those that could not eat the honey aren't left just chomping on the lonesome crispy chicken skin. I myself thought the chicken was flavorful enough to eat without any sauce! Haha. The Gyro tacos were also an amazing choice! The lamb was perfectly seasoned and juicy! The Taziki was superb and pita was not thick and perfectly crunchy, just how I liked it! They come in an order of three but as many can me added to an order. We also ordered the pierogies, meatballs and beets. They were good also but the chicken skins and tacos are a must try!  As of drinks, do not order the Moscow Mule! It was extremely bitter! However I saw someone order something really tasty and the waiter explained it to be a spicy margarita. It was amazing! I wish I remembered the name of the drink. It was a spicy margarita topped off with a spicy rim and a lime! (I'm going to think long and hard about the name and if it comes back to me I'll definitely update my review.   Since it is a small restaurant with a smaller kitchen, the waiter warned us that the food may take a while. He explained that dishes will be taken out as they are made because the size of the kitchen and the amount of people they are cooking for. I thought it was very nice that the waiter explained this to us.   I will definitely be back here to try more on the menu!",

I recommend starting with the bacon jam, followed by the chicken and Mac and cheese as entrees. Small plates but surprisingly filling. So delicious! Service was great too.",

It's clear that they work really hard to keep their menu fresh and creative, and I wish them continued success and expansion!",

    "text": "It's about time that I finally sat down and wrote a review for the Carson Kitchen... My girlfriend and I have been to this place approximately 8 times since moving to Las Vegas last year. There's a reason that we keep coming back, it's friggin fantastic!  Heres the skinny: Carson Kitchen is a small, hip, yet unassuming, spot in Downtown Las Vegas that caters to nouveau foodie crowd. The space is tight, the ambiance is lively, and the food is killer.  We've experienced three different menu changes since we've been coming here (CK alters their menu seasonally in order to incorporate new recipes which reflect the time of year) and we have yet to be disappointed. Most items on the menu are designed to be shared and the best strategy for a meal here is to come with people who are comfortable sharing and order a bunch of different dishes to taste.  Some of the dishes that we keep coming back to are: Bacon Jam ('nuff said, just get it), Tempura Green Beans (delicious pepper-cream cheese dipping sauce), The espresso-cocoa rubbed Strip Steak (better than steaks that i've had at 5-star dedicated steak restaurants), Crispy Chicken Skins (YOLO), the shockingly good Mac & Cheese (great as a side with entrees), and the Black Rice Oxtail Risotto (a rich and creamy, albeit slightly al dente version that always impresses).   Oh god I almost forgot the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding dessert... That is the goods right there. The things I would do for that Bread Pudding might get me blocked from Yelp if I were to go into detail...  The servers are all welcoming, friendly, informative, and above all on top of their game. Any issues are remedied before they can become a real problem, drinks are always filled, and they are more than happy to give recommendations and answer questions.   I've taken every Vegas visitor that we've had in town to the Carson Kitchen and each and every time it is a highlight of their trip and we hear about it their love for this place for weeks afterwards. My only fear is that this place will become too popular and the quality will slip; but so far CK has held up strongly over almost a year of repeat visits. Love this place, keep it up!",

I ordered a margarita, which was not overly sweet and the \"Secret Sunday Chicken\" sandwich.  The sandwich was packed with flavor and I would highly recommend it. The staff was friendly and unpretentious. You should check out this gem.",

We were absolutely stuffed and beyond satisfied for under a hundred dollars.

I asked for a table and she said they can only have party of 6 or more in tables even though the place was empty. The waiter was really nice and the food is amazing they just need to reconsider that girl in their Staff. Emily you are by far the worst hostess ever! If you don't like your work please do us a favor and quit. That ruined our experience at Carson kitchen.",

Starting with the devil's eggs. Wow! I licked the plate clean lol. Then the gyro tacos which were excellent, and being from Austin I like to see different twists on tacos. The piece de resistance was the jerky Turkey burger. It was something very heavenly with a crunchy jerky crust on the outside. Wow! Highly recommended and can't wait to go back to try other menu offerings next time im in Vegas. Bye Felicia!",

We travel to find new places based on good food, good service, with a great vibe. I stumbled on a review of this trendy hipster movement that seems to be happening in towns from coast to coast. We have found many. We now have another one to add to our favorites list. One block from Fremont street you will find carson kitchen. From the outside, you would never guess what they are doing indoors. We went there for lunch on a Thursday. It was busy, with about a 10 minute wait. The whole time we talked to the hostess who was so excited to be leaving NV and putting her food biology degree to use. We wish her well ! We were seated at a big table with 3 other customers. Some people might not like this, we love it. We're people - people. Never met a stranger ! We were greeted by \" Felicia \" our waitress. She went over the menu, got our drinks going, came back to figure out what we were going to try. This place has a great \" share \" options. A great way to try many items. We started with the fried chicken skins, ( don't judge us ) delicious!!! Had to order the lamb tacos, started talking with the other friends\" we were seated with, and before long we were sharing food. We ordered the bacon jam with brie, grilled artichoke! Our neighbors ordered green beans and mac and cheese, oh my !! I've had a lot of artichokes and this one was the best. Everything we had was amazing !! Our kids were flying into town in a few days. We were thinking where we were going to take them for dinner. With so many options in Vegas we have never gone back to the same place, yet alone the same place in the same trip. But that's what we did. We came back on Saturday night. Had a bit of a wait, even after we called. No reservations, but they will add your name 20-30 min out. If took a bit longer because we requested \" Felicia \" again. Our dinner order: chicken skins( don't judge us again ) lamb taco ( lettuce wrapped because of the GF daughter) still tasty, black rice risotto, devil eggs, two orders of artichokes, and ended with whiskey desert drinks and the best bread pudding ever tasted. I can't say enough about this place. Do a few things really really well and you will be successful on many levels. Add amazing wait staff, which they have and it gets even better. We can't wait to come back. I can't give more than 5 stars but I would.",

Every time I've been there the staff have gone above and beyond to make sure my experience is great.   The drinks and food are exceptional. There are very few restaurants that I would say everything is good. Everything is good here!   A few of my favorites would be the Bacon Jam, the shrimp, their Mac and Cheese is dang good. All their burgers are great and steak.   I can't wait for this place to extend in the Vegas area. They need more locations for sure.",

    "text": "We tried this on a recommendation.  It's not quite in the heart of the bustling Fremont crowd, which surprised me, but later, I was quite thankful for that.  You're close enough to walk to the Fremont craziness but about 1-2 blocks away, enough to make an easier arrival/escape.  We were escorted to a cute little courtyard waiting area, which was cool.  It looked like there were tables downstairs and upstairs (outdoor area upstairs?) although I never saw stairs inside.  The downstairs is all I saw.  It was small but had an energy about it.  1) Bacon Jam (baked brie w/ toasted baguette) = 5/5 (sweet and salty and spicy and sour all at the same time, very complex flavors made this very unique 2) Tempura Green Beans (pepper jelly cream cheese) = 5/5 (so glad my co-diner ordered this, the red pepper cream cheese was so tasty) 3) Baked Mac & Cheese = 4.5/5 (pretty darn good, solid mac n cheese) 4) Butter Burger = 5/5 (such a good burger, moist, unique flavors, seasoned well, melty cheese, yummy sauce)  I will say we each ordered a burger (which he told us was a full meal w/ spicy tots - also very good) and shared the bacon jam, tempura beans, and mac n cheese.  This was WAY too much food for four people!!  We loved our three shared items so much and think we should order 1 cheeseburger as a shared item as well instead of a whole burger for each of us.  Very high recommendation for this place.",

What I enjoy about Carson Kitchen is how many of the items on the menu are sharable, making this the perfect location to dine at with a small group. Emphasis on SMALL because this place does get packed around peak hours.   On to the food!  Crispy Chicken Skins: Eating these gave me a warm, comforting feeling..or were my arteries clogging up? Whatever. Fried chicken skins served without the chicken is a daydream come True. The smoked honey sauce goes great with skins, though the deep fried flavor is fine by itself.   Bison Meatloaf Sliders: I stalked Carson Kitchen's Instagram and spotted these sliders and had to have them. The petite patties are flavorful and moist and come with a side of tater tots.  Veal Meatballs: Essentially, fancy Swedish meatballs, but, you know, way better because of the sherry foie gras cream. *salivating*  Compared to my previous visit, the service was warmer, and I attribute this to having eaten at the bar. It just felt like we received more attention there as opposed to eating at a table. Before I forget, there are purse hooks beneath the bar counter, because who wants to cradle their baggage while eating?  I can't stress enough how dining here is a MUST if you're in the downtown area. The menu may sound unusual, but keep an open mind.",

The burrata and asparagus salad (which also had summer peas and something else...fennel?) was fresh and perfect for the heat. The oxtail and black rice risotto was tangy and sweet, fun texture. The gyro tacos were a fun \"appetizer\" of sorts. We would have ordered a few more dishes if we hadn't have dinner plans already. Come by if you're feeling off-strip for a casual, chill atmosphere and some fun dishes.  The 3 small plates plus a drink was something like $70, I think, but both tummies definitely had space on our way out. (Space for... giant donuts next door, actually.)",

My friend and I shared 4 social plates and they were all delicious.   Crispy chicken skins served with smoked honey sauce- Seriously, who doesn't love chicken skin?? These babies are deep fried and fattening as hell, but oh so yummy. I didnt particularly care for the side-o-honey it came with though. The portion was definitely enough for 2 or more people to share.   Tempura green beans with pepper jelly cream cheese- These were super yummy. I thought the beans could have taken a little longer of a tempura bath cause they weren't that crispy, but this is not a deal breaker. I really liked these and would order again.  Bacon jam- Hellloooo gorgeous. Bacon, brie, and served to your table bubbling what's not to love? To be honest I found the jam to be a little too sweet, and only had a little bit of this but I can see how this is a popular dish.   \"Devil's\" Eggs- Deviled eggs with panchetta and caviar- So good. There were 4 to each order and I wish we had ordered at least 10 because they were so yummy.   My dining companion ordered the secret Sunday chicken sandwich for her hubs to go, and she said it was really good. I decided to get one to go for my man. Luckily for me, he didnt end up eating it so I had it for dinner. The sandwich was pretty good. The chicken was tender and juicy even after I had reheated it in the microwave and the bun was soft. It comes with sauce on the sammy, but since I was getting it togo  I got a side of it which was spicy pickle aioli. It tasted just like a spicy pickle!! The sandwich also came with spicy tots which were yummy and even better dipped in the aioli.  I am already planning my next meal here. They are open late, and at nights you can sit upstairs on the patio which is awesome for prime people watching. I totally recommend this place and I can't wait to come back.",

Even though Carson Kitchen has a 6th street address, the door is actually located on Carson Street two doors down from O Face Donuts, in the Carson Building.  The smallish space has a lot of charm and warmth and seems to encourage a social dining experience.  There are only a few 4-top tables, but there's a huge butcher block topped bar with seating on both sides, as well as another that overlooks the open kitchen.  The brick walls and wood beams add to the sense of warmth in the space.  Today we tried the Tempura Green Beans with pepper jelly cream cheese and the Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip with a red wine demi glace.  The Tempura batter was fantastic.  Light and crispy, not greasy at all, and the seasoning was perfect.  The word \"jelly\" does not sound appealing to me when thinking about a Tempura Dip, but it was Awesome! and the consistency was more of a cream than a jelly.  The NY Strip was slices of Heaven!  Since we did family style I would definitely order a double batch of this next time.  The crust on the steak with the warm red center was perfect and the rich flavor was fantastic.  But the wine demi was a star.  I kept dipping my pieces in the ever dwindling pool until it was gone.  Seating was quick and the Service was good.  We will definitely be back.",

It was pretty easy for the Uber to find and not a hassle to get picked up or dropped off.   The venue is small, very intimate, and there is lots of table sharing. When I arrived there was a 20 minute wait but I was able to find 2 chairs at the bar for my friend and I. If you must wait for a table, there is a waiting area outside the restaurant in the back. The restaurant was really clean and quiet. The patrons were mostly dressed for dates.   I had the deviled eggs, chicken skins, tacos and a sangria. Each item was made to order and arrived at different times. They were all seasoned and prepared extremely well. The bartender was really really polite and offered great suggestions on both food and beverage items.   I loved this place and I would recommend it to anyone traveling to Vegas.",

It was pretty full since their upper patio area had some kind of business thing going on so I had to wait about 5 minutes for a seat at the bar.  The wait wasn't bad since there is a little courtyard right out the back door that has some nice seats to wait.  When I was sat at the bar the bartender asked if I was having any food tonight.  When I said yes she gave me a menu and a napkin with silverware.  I got a Margarian to drink and ordered the pork belly Cuban sandwich.  While I was waiting for my food the guy next to me got an order of the mac and cheese and it smelled awesome.  I almost want to change my order because of that.  The drink was light and refreshing and the sandwich was really good.  I really enjoyed the spicy tots that came with sandwich as well.  As much as I would have liked to have ordered dessert, my meter time was almost up on my car.  The bartender quickly got me my bill and I was back out in time to feed the meter.  Based on the service and deliciousness of the food I will definitely be back the next time I'm downtown.",

I always wondered why someone never put that on a menu because people eat pork rinds so why not give our poultry friends some love?  We went in here for a quick snack and were drawn here by the chicken skin appetizer.  It was a Saturday at 2pm and the place was packed so I can only imagine the crowds at dinner.  The fried chicken skins ($8) did not disappoint; however, it might have been too much of a good thing because it was too rich to finish them all.  I recommend going with a big group and sharing this appetizer with a few friends.   The menu was very impressive and the bacon jam looked like a winner. I watched other people get their burgers and they looked amazing as they came out....great presentation as well.   When I am back in Vegas I will definitely come back to try their other dishes.   Carson Kitchen reminds me of the Milwaukee restaurant the Social when it was still open.  It is an open kitchen with a very innovative menu at affordable prices.  If you are staying downtown, take a few block walk to this great restaurant.  Also, I would check if they take reservations because this place will probably be packed at dinner.",

We ended up getting the crispy chicken skins, bacon jam, deviled eggs, turkey burger, and bread pudding. ALL amazing!! ONLY thing I'd say is that the bacon jam could be a bit... baconier? And it could use more Brie! But still. DELICIOUS!! And Felicia the bartender MADE our experience! She's a foodie to the CORE just like me so I trusted all her suggestions!! She was spot on with everything. And the cocktail she made (margadian?) was perfectly balanced and delish. Anytime we come back to Vegas, we will come here!! I can't say enough good about it!",

Light crunch on the outside and super tender in the inside....the sauce is something your palette has ever tasted. Foi gras sauce with cherry vinegar, peas....just lovely!   I will be dreaming of them until next time!   The gyro tacos was brilliant! I don't like lamb , but the way they made is like ground beef and the small pita bread taco was genus. Tender and full of flavor  We also ordered the mushroom flatbread and all it needed was a little truffle oil and a touch of sea salt.  Definitely coming back - I have my eye on a couple more items....I'll be back!   I love the BAllS!!!!",

Other places were really crowded, but we only had to wait about 10 minutes here to get seated. We got to sit on their upstairs patio which was lovely. It was a great day to sit outside. We ordered the Secret Sunday Chicken sandwich, Bacon Jam with Baked Brie, and Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto.  My favorite was definitely the chicken sandwich!! The chicken was perfectly fried and tender, and the sauce/aioli they put was so good. Everything went so well together. I also really loved the tater tots they came with. The bacon jam was really good! It was my first time trying anything like that before and it did not disappoint. It really reminded me of cha siu bao (bbq pork buns at dimsum) because of the sweetness combined with the pork! I really liked the flavor of the risotto, but I felt that the texture was a bit hard for a risotto. I expected it to be more creamy and the rice to be softer. It's probably because they didn't use arborio which is the typical rice that is used in risotto, so I should've expected it. I did think that the water tasted kinda weird (maybe it's just LV water?) but it wasn't a huge deal. Our waitress was super sweet and overall a great server. Would definitely recommend this place!",

This was the perfect spot to get away from the craziness of the strip and to sit back and relax and enjoy some good food and company.    We ordered the gyro tacos, which were so savory and tasty.. These were probably my favorite items we ate. Get these if you come here! :)  Tempura green beans were a hearty portion and came with a great dipping sauce, but our favorite veggie dish was the rainbow cauliflower.  So good!   Catfish sandwich was filling without feeling heavy, which I liked... The bread was crispy and the fish was flaky, light and well seasoned and the spicy tater tots were delicious!!!  My least favorite dish was the pesto flatbread which was a little on the heavier/salty side for my taste, but all around, this was a great dining experience here and I would definitely recommend giving it a try!",

Not only was I contacted, I was contacted within 15 minutes of actually posting them which is really impressive... Cory I wish I had a better time at your Restaurant but well done in your response   Not impressed Don't believe the hype I had pineapple vodka which was barely any vodka whatsoever and that's OK if the food is good the mac & cheese is decent but nothing we ate was really worth raving about. The chicken skins were very tasty and it's a novel concept I've seen nowhere else, literally just chicken skins deep fried. We had the grilled cheese with short rib it was unremarkable .. the tots were good. The tacos were boring and the devil eggs were about on par with something you'd expect a friend to bring to a Christmas party when they're making them for the first time. I had huge hopes for this place and that could be tainting my review But their yelp rating was through the roof and I definitely did not enjoy it. The bill with tip came to about a buck 128 for four people and if I had any inkling that this was going to be the case there's no way in hell I would've gone. It was overpriced and we left unsatisfied and slightly hungry.  They do give a military discount",

Although there was a 10-ish minute wait at 1pm on a Saturday, we're so glad we stayed.   The host was courteous and caring. Our server was super helpful and cool. The restaurant is trendy and the menu is full of great choices.   Can't forget the back of the house team...simply dope!!! They push out so much, great quality, consistency, and they have fun!!!  Do yourself a solid and stop by Carson Kitchen while in Vegas. If you're a local, run there now!   We had the BBQ Burnt Ends (can be a bit fatty), Pig & Fig, Jerk Turkey Burger, Butter Burger, Purple Haze, and Bad Beat IPA. The tots are salty crunchy heaven.   If there was more time and space in our bellys, the Wild Mushroom flatbread  and Glazed Donut Bread Pudding looked amazing!!!",

Next up tempura green beans they were ok but the cream cheese was a weird combo maybe they would taste better with something else. Mac and cheese is ok but the truffle oil is a bit too much, last the butter burger lol avoid not worth it AT ALL. Overall this place feels like it's trying so hard to be hipster and cool it just falls flat the food isn't good enough to make me want to deal with pretentious staff. Never going back.",

They did run out of one item and the nice host did apologize for it. No issues. After we finished the appetizer, we ordered entrees and everything was nicely presented and pretty yummy. Our waitress seemed very absent and I had to ask a couple of times to refill our drinks. It was hard to flag her down, and the host was the one who brought us our food.

    "text": "The downtown revitalization of Las Vegas has dramatically changed the dining options available today compared to 15 years ago when I was visiting more regularly. Certainly if you are looking for a bottomless plate of Ribeye for $8.99, you can shuffle along for about a block and get just that. However if you want a modern, hipster foodie spot, with taste that backs up the attitude, then this is a must. They don't seem to care about making you wait, and even seem to like throwing out attitude if you expect something faster. The kitchen is small but quick. Due to limited tables reservations are not taken. If you have a large party or are impatient, get there early. The staff is \"cool\" with uniformly dissimilar artsy hair styles and no name tags, but look for Nirvana and Bowie tees to designate staff.   Now the most important part: The food is delicious! I especially enjoyed the gyro tacos, bacon jam, turkey burger, all way above expectations. If you like tapas style eating this place leans that way, with the waiters even encouraging sharing multiple plate. I was sceptical at first, and showed up borderline hangry, but left completely satisfied. The price was extremely reasonable, costing about the same as breakfast on the strip for two, as dinner did for 4 of us.  Walk it off with a stroll around container park or play frogger along the Fremont. Parking is super easy, with lots open around the block",

We ordered the fig and Brie, which I loved, he did not. I ordered the shrimp and grits which were amazing, I'm craving it now, and he had one of their pizzas, he wasn't impressed. Overall, the service was great, and we are planning to go back during another season when the menu changes. Hoping a different menu will change his mind about this place, because I will absolutely return!",

    "text": "Jesus Christ this place is delicious! I thought it went beyond just \"good, well executed dishes\". They really did a great job using a lot of cool flavors.  Mac n' Cheese: $12 - I loved it! They had little bits of garlic sprinkled on top which I've never seen before, but really livened it up. The pasta was cooked perfectly; a little al dente. The cheese was creamy and delicious. And they also had bits of shredded cheese sprinkled in that you'd get a taste of to provide some more variety.  Butter Burger: $14 - My girlfriend got this; really, we shared both. She ordered it medium well and it came out moderately pink on the inside. Reading some other reviews, it seems that this is a consistent pattern. She liked it though, and so did I, so it's all good. The burger was juicy and delicious. It was served hot off the grill. I loved the cheese too; not overwhelming; just the right amount to balance the meat. My girlfriend loved the spicy tater tots. To me, they were the one thing there that was average.  Bourbon Fudge Brownie: $8 - This desert was awesome. It had \"brown butter bacon ice cream\" and a really really rich brownie. I really liked the ice cream a lot. The brownie was good, but it was a bit too rich for me. I also like this sort of dish when the brownie is warm. I would have preferred if they have more ice cream and less brownie; I think what makes the dish is when you eat them together, and in this case the proportions were off. But that's nitpicking. It was great. Also, they weren't shy in about adding bacon! It was good, but it was also a little overwhelming to me. My girlfriend thought the bacon was just too much and picked it out.  Other than the dishes, I thought the atmosphere was pretty cool. It was extremely extremely hipster. We sat at the bar and they have an open kitchen. I really liked that. I enjoy watching them cook.  The service was good.  Overall, I was really happy and am excited to go back to try new dishes. I thought the flavors were awesome. Most dishes were in the $10-20 price range - I would pay $30+ to eat here.",

One of the best things I've eaten.  I've never had oxtail before. It looked kind of goopy and weird. Surprisingly amazing though. My only complaint would be the music.  It was really outdated and out of place in a trendy spot.",

The bourbon fudge brownie and the bread pudding were enough to make me go back a on another occasion just for dessert and drinks. Definitely a decadent a way to treat your self after a long day or long week of work and great to share with friends and family. The cocktails have been top notch from the times I've gone. Not only is the Simon Says Sangria refreshing but definitely one of my favorites on the menu that would complement any meal with citrus notes that mixes perfectly with the white wine. The communication breakdown cocktail was a lavender infused cocktail with italian liqueur and tequila that had a smoky yet fragrant quality. They have a wide assortment of cocktails that are handcrafted and unique only exclusive carsons kitchen. I I can't wait to go back and try another cocktail. Hands-down the best place in Vegas for a late night meal with friends or family or even if you're looking to just have a nice dinner by yourself with good drinks good food. Overall my favorite spot in Vegas.",

Staff are kind to us always and the food is just as amazing, except for one dish \"lamb spiedies.\" My only constructive criticism for the restaurant is that dish; it's a little too sour and the bread gets soggy once it's get too the table and the lamb is a little tough, but the everything else makes up for it. I still plan on going back because it's that good and also because the Donut Bread Pudding is the best thing ever invented in the world!",

It can get kinda busy in there so call ahead if you have a large party. It's tapas/family sharing style and the portions aren't very big so be prepared to order quite a bit. Can be pricey but well worth he money. Don't l ave without trying the chicken skins.",

    "text": "Started my weekend off right with my favorite couple, Christina W. and Arvin C. and my fiance' and I having a double date night!   We've been curious of the buzz and were heading to DCR so we looked through bookmarks for something nearby. It was busy, but we were able to have a table upstairs on the cute rooftop patio.  We just ate family style and shared all our items.   Wellington Empanada- the empanada serving comes with 2. This was crispy but the flavors were just A-OK for me.   Roasted young beets - I'm a sucker for the trifecta of beets, with a soft cheese (goat cheese in this case) and pistachios. The orange slices and microgreens were nice in this. Solid salad.   Rainbow Cauliflower - it's really simple, but it's done right. Nice roast and seasoning on it.   Chicken Skin - these were delish and naughty! The smoked honey reminds me of being a kid and dipping KFC chicken in those janky honey sauce packets that come with the biscuit.   The following is more meal portioned than appetizers as they are sandwiches plus spicy tater tots.   Fried Green Tomato Sandwich - this was lovely as it had a lump crab ravigote salad and greens that went perfectly with the crispy fried tomato and I enjoyed the bread quite a bit.   Short Rib Sliders- came with 3. The root beer glaze was sweet, but it worked for me. It reminds me of this braised pork dish that's cooked in root beer and spices.   The tater tots were standard, but good. Real crispy and dusted with seasoning spices.   Then for dessert we tried the glazed donut bread pudding. They use day old donuts from O Face next door. It was soft and moist and the sauce reminds me of a bananas foster. Real good.   Service was pretty good. They were doing training so we had the attention of a server and their trainee. Drinks were refilled in a timely manner and they were friendly and paced out our food pretty well too.  Overall, I enjoyed the food and didn't think it was outrageously priced, but can be the type of place to add up quick when you go small plates. Out of all the items we got, the Fried Green Tomato sandwich was the best deal, but it also was my favorite dish.With that said, I think $75 for four is not a bad price for what we received in flavor and quality. I will be back soon as I need more fried green tomato sandwiches in my life.",

Lots of great stuff on the menu, we opted for the butter burger and the turkey burger with jerk seasoning. Turkey burger was delicious, great flavor, loved the cole slaw on top. I was afraid it might be a bit dry, but it was just right. Bun was a little  sweet, which was odd, but still decent. My husband wanted his burger done medium and it was pretty rare-lots of blood on the plate. I guess he could've sent it back but we didn't want to deal, and it was still good. He thought the tater tots were not as good as fries would've been.  Great place to stop at, I love the restaurants in downtown Vegas, definitely more real, with real food.",

Loved our server, Manny and the General Manager stopped by as well.  They gave great detail about food so you could make an informed decision.  Sampled 6 different entrees since we all ordered different entrees and ALL were terrific!  If you want to go I would advise reservations because it is small so it's busy.  Love this restaurant and will definitely go back every chance I get.",

Its a Kerry Simon restaurant so you know the food is going to be good, and not outrageously priced. During the summer its really nice to sit upstairs and enjoy the music and the shade, but the vibe inside is just as good.",

My waitress was awesome and super friendly, and there was the most handsome boy I have ever seen was expediting, so until my friend showed up, I stared directly at his butt. So far, this is a terribly written review. Anyhoo- My friend was late, so I ordered the beet salad. So delicious and perfectly balanced with the addition of goat cheese and orange. All I could think of was the hot guys butt, NO I MEAN TEMPURA GREEN BEANS WITH PEPPER JELLY CREAM CHEESE DIPPING SAUCE.  I would dip anything into that, it's so good. Then I had the butter burger. I've been wanting to try one since I saw it on a tv food show about Wisconsin and I thought, I may be fat but I'm not flying to Wisconsin for a cheeseburger, even if coated with butter. (I realize that I COULD have made one at home, but space travel has also been invented and I'm not doing that either.). How was it you ask? Do you have to ask?  It was DELICIOUS. DUH. It comes with tater tots. I almost bypassed them because I did fill up on vegetables, but they were the best tater tots I've ever had. Soooooo crispy on the outside and fluffy potato-y goodness on the inside.  I WILL BE BACK.",

We couldn't make a reservation but called on the way over to put our names on. We ordered drinks at the bar, and suddenly our table was ready. I loved my \"Get Shorty\" -- sort of a spicy margarita. We sat outside on the patio upstairs. It was warm, welcoming and wonderful.   All of our food was delicious. Most memorable were the bacon jam (what?) and the veal meatballs. I'm Swedish, and I know a thing or two about meatballs. It was something in between Swedish meatballs and another Swedish dish called Wallenbergare. Pure delight.   I loved the cool atmosphere, and such a diverse crowd.  Thanks so much. If I get to Vegas again I will be back!",

I mean, Fried Chicken Skin?!?! So delicious.  My husband is a big fan of the burger. I had the veggie flatbread. And both were fresh and tasty.  Service is amazing. We sat at the bar to eat. I don't know his name but he is a True mixologist. Every drink is hand crafted to perfection.  The only bad thing is that is is small. And when it gets busy it feels kind of cramped. We didn't have to wait but I imagine the wait time on a busy night could be long.  Love DTLV and love Carson Kitchen!",

Plus a drink called Ms that I could of done without.  The  killer shrimp had a light almost like tempura batter with lime infused jalapenos. Mmm. The sauce on.them wasn't over powering and tasteful. The gyro tacos were lamb and goat cheese with an awesome sauce. Need I say more.  I should of gone for the good Rodney Strong chardonnay they had. The drink was ok but far to plain to be amazing.",

The raw garlic in the gremolata they top it with takes it over the top in the best possible way) 4) Sunday fried chicken sandwich (pretty great as far as fried chicken breast sandwiches go... The spicy tots they serve on the side are the real star) 5) Rainbow cauliflower. (GET IT. Especially since the main entrees don't come with sides) 6) Chicken thighs (Well-cooked, but literally it's just two chicken thighs on a plate with some chimichurri. Also WAY oversalted.) 7) Short rib stroganoff (This was the only misfire of our meal. Whatever spirit they used in the sauce completely overpowered the dish and gave it a horrible aftertaste. The meat was perfectly done though)  Service was awesome! Tiny space, so make reservations. We came in during the lunch hour and got a table, but it was packed by the time we left.",

Unlike a lot of new places downtown they don't assume you're going to just drink the koolaid. They were ernest in their desire to make sure we were comfortable and happy with our food. They seemed to have actually tasted most of the food and had good recommendations for us. Much like La Comida, I'd eat here again regardless of what I thought of the food because the staff made the experience worthwhile. Fyi, I don't care for the food at La Comida.   The food. Well. We split oxtail risotto which, honestly, was so rich as to be offputting. I ate maybe four spoonfuls as did my lunch date. There was plenty left to take home but we passed. We also had the bacon jam with brie. It was actually delish, but again, a little went a long way. A very long way. Again, we passed on taking the extra home. The empanadas were filled with nice chunky meat that was tender though it could've been a tad juicier. The mushroom flatbread was a great appetizer and the pizza cook was lots of fun without being overly familiar.  Here's my issue and it's something you can actually see in the accompanying picture. The risotto and jam seemed to be swimming in something. It wasn't grease. Maybe some oil like truffle? The lake of whatever it was did not inspire one to want to deal with that in a to go box or when it inevitably congealed. Again, offputting is the only word I can find to describe my feelings about it. It really wasn't greasy or slimy, but it looks that way. Combined with the fact that everything (except the empanadas) was just way too rich means I won't be pushing this as a place to go. Not yet.   I'm sure that Carson Kitchen will find it's feet very soon, and hope so. I like the vibe even if the decor looks like someone went to EAT and decided that's the new downtown Vegas hip eatery look. Seriously, it almost looks like a blatant rip off. They seemed to be working on an outside patio which in and of itself will get me back this summer. And, not to be petty, I give it points for being filled with adults, not a bunch of bearded wannabes.   The pricing seemed a tad ambitious. For small plates you can go from a quick bite to a $50 lunch in no time. Not outrageous but probably not in my, \"let's run by for a nosh\", price range.  I look forward to sampling more of Carson Kitchen soon but I'm hoping they bring the ooze down a notch. Go check it out for yourself, it's worth a try. Good luck Carson Kitchen, welcome downtown!",

    "text": "So I tried this restaurant for the first time last Thursday . So let's start with the basics. I like the decor, and our server was Bianca. She was real nice and have great service in spite of being real busy or short staffed. The hostess though had the fuck off face. Maybe she was having a bad day.  Now about the food. I tired the bacon jam. That shit is bomb! Only one problem. They barely give any bread with it. My table had to ask like 2 extra servings of bread.   The deviled eggs was good. But I think they can add a dollar more and give one more egg.   The pierogi tasted very bland. Thank goodness for the Cheese wiz with it.  My main issue was their risotto. The rice was so undercooked. The rice was hard. I wanted to send it back but I'm seen the movie \"waiting\" and I didn't want to be bothersome since my friends and I were having a good time. But really they got to work on the timing of cooking the risotto.   So my suggestion is don't order it unless you wanting the risotto coming out the way it came in. Hard. That's what she said! Lol",

The inside of the Carson kitchen matches that hip, semi-industrial vibe. Surprisingly, the clientele seems to trend away from hip and so-industrial! No big deal, but on a Friday evening, the average age was definitely over 40! I'm not one of these bacon-crazed people, but I saw that the bacon jam was the hot item, so we had to order it. Your reviews did not steer us wrong! It was awesome! Overall, we enjoyed all the food and the server delivered with excellent cocktail recommendations.  Service was friendly if a little slow.  Overall, Carson kitchen may be my top choice for downtown dinner right now!",

The menu had a limited selection, and 4 of the already limited items were unavailable the night we ate there.  My daughter enjoyed the butter burger.  We had no qualm with the quality of food or service, however we felt it was too expensive for the amount served, and we could not find free parking nearby.",

Would not get again.   Mac and Cheese: decent, enjoyed the crust, nothing exceptional.   rainbow cauliflower: very garlicky (in a good way) and spicy.  I'd say prob a 8/10. Good but again, not exceptional.   I was disappointed that the cocktails were not strong at all. If i'm paying 13$ for a cocktail I expect it to pack a punch, unfortunately they just tasted like juice.   I was also really annoyed that the waiter kept pushing me to either 1. buy a drink or 2. buy a more expensive drink. Nothing bugs me more than pushy service.",

I was expecting some really fantastic food, and this was, unfortunately, not it.   We sat at the bar, and the bartender was friendly, but service was incredibly slow. Our food took an extraordinary amount of time. We ordered the oxtail risotto and the burger. The burger was very poorly cooked and had to be sent back. Apparently, their method for cooking does not align with how we feel meat should be cooked. The oxtail risotto had a strange flavor to it that I would not like to really eat again.

The kitchen staff & waitstaff have a tightly run ship that runs smoothly. My partner & I were lucky to be seated by the kitchen & witness the beautifully efficient system they have in place, getting food to patrons in a timely manner. We were very impressed. Despite the place being packed & busy, the kitchen manager stayed on top of orders and made sure that everyone had food at their table within a reasonable amount of time and even managed to make friendly conversation with us in between orders. Our waitress was super friendly & helpful as well. She informed us ahead of time that food comes out as it's ready (not all at once) & dishes are intended to be shared. My kind of dining! Our food came to us at a steady pace.   We also asked our waitress for recommendations & she did not steer us wrong!   She suggested the Baked Mac & Cheese. Sounds like a pretty basic dish & I was reluctant but I'm sure glad we got it! It was soooo good. Not sure what kind of magical cheese they use, but it was delicious & it had truffle oil, which makes any simple food decadent. Great spin on a classic. And the baked bread crumbs sprinkled on top added a nice balance of crunch to the creamy gooey goodness.   The Roasted Young Beets with pistachios, orange, & goat cheese was an amazing combination of flavors. Very light & refreshing.   The Steelhead Trout with almond relish & creamed kale was also fantastic. The skin was crisp to perfection & the flesh was moist. No clue how they do that. I can't recall eating a more perfectly cooked fish.   Great to have had a positive experience during our stay in Vegas.",

    "text": "I've had the pleasure of having both lunch and dinner at Carson Kitchen. It's a rustic new addition to the downtown scene.   Both times I dined we started with the Crispy Chicken Skins and the Bacon Jam. I am not into the chicken skins, but almost everyone I went with both times loved them. They are salty and the honey is smokey and sweet. I get the allure, but I am not into the chicken flavor. The bacon jam however, is definitely my jam! You MUST start with this and then slather it onto whatever you order. It's packed full of flavor and unbelievably delicious. It comes out piping hot, so try not to dive right in.  On to the entrees! The Secret Sunday Chicken sandwich is an upscale take on a Chick-Fil-A favorite. The chicken is moist and fried to perfection with a delicate and light batter. The spicy pickle aioli is perfection, I would be in trouble if they bottled this and the jam. Speaking of the jam, don't be afraid to add it to your sandwich! I wasn't a fan of the spice used on the tater tots, so those fell short for me. I've also had the short rib stroganoff and it was just OK. The flavors weren't as rich and creamy as I had hoped and something tasted a little off. I did however spice it up with some bacon jam, I may have a problem. I would skip the stroganoff and try a burger next time.  Overall, there were some hits and misses, but the hits overshadowed the misses for me. I find the service to be a bit spotty, but the food is worth a try if you're downtown.",

I have had numerous experiences here and from food to service to ambiance and price, this place has stole a little piece of my foodie heart. Not that it surprises me that a Kerry Simon place would win me over. I mean, the staff has to wear rock & roll t-shirts. Would you expect anything less? My first experience was on a busy Friday night, and we sat upstairs at the patio bar. My second trip, I came right at the start of business, and was lucky enough to get a seat at the open kitchen aka Chef's table. If you know me, you know that is my favorite place to sit. I love watching the kitchen staff interact. I love watching the food be made right before your eyes. Also, in this particular kitchen, I really love the passion of the staff. It was clear they wanted everything perfect before leaving that kitchen.  So far I have indulged in: devil's eggs, corn succotash, baked mac and cheese, gyro tacos, watermelon salad, a butter burger, a sloppy joe, and some bread pudding. I would order every one of those items again. And let me point out, I never ordered the tacos to begin with. My daughter and I were dinging together one day, and they were sent out compliments of the Chef. Total score. We devoured them, and still ordered our entrees and appetizer. I plan on trying the chicken skins, bacon jam, and killer shrimp on my next visit.  I don't know why it took me so long to get to this place, but I am glad I finally checked it out. Perfect addition to downtown Vegas!",

Their chairs have no backs and are all \"bar stool\" style. My husband has back issues and for him when a place does not have booths or seating with some type of back support it can be a deal breaker. We were seated promptly and presented with a modest but quality cocktail list. We opted for beverages of the non adult kind, but they did seem to have some creative cocktails on the menu.  I chose their scallops with rainbow cauliflowers which were phenomenal. The scallop was cooked to perfection in their mango habanero sauce. I don't know what they do to the cauliflower, but it was delicious, crunchy and slightly charred for the added flavor. My husband had their Cuban sandwich with the fingerling potatoes. That was one of the better spins on a Cuban sandwich I have experienced in a very long time. The bread was fresh and crispy and the inside was an explosion of flavor. The fingerling potatoes were garnished with parmesan cheese and truly were nothing to write home about.  The server was accommodating and friendly. Our check arrived in a book which serves as some type of a guest book where you can write in feedback or random comments. The prices are not cheap, but the food is worth it. The scallops were $17 and the cauliflower side order $8. Keep in mind it comes with three small scallops that are bursting with flavor. Make sure to fill the meters for parking because you will get towed. Also, if you hate hipsters stay away.",

The menu is simplistic, but creatively hatched. There wasn't anything that we ordered that I didn't like. Many plates are perfect for sharing, which is encouraged.  Of the social plates, there is a trio of must-tries. If you like chicharrones, the crispy chicken skins are highly recommended. Dipped in smoked honey, these tasty snacks were wildly addictive. The gyro tacos (3) were well-balanced and liked by all. My personal favorite was the bacon jam. The jam was topped with baked brie and spread on a toasted baguette. The flavors were a punch in the mouth: sweet, salty, smoky, and creamy.   For mains, we shared the cocoa-espresso NY strip steak and the two flatbreads with a side of fingerling potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare with a tasty red wine demi glaze. It was better than a lot of the steakhouses in Vegas.   We were already satisfied, but got a dessert to share anyway. The glazed donut bread pudding is one of the best and most unique bread puddings I've tried in a while. Served with three rum caramel and vanilla creme anglaise, it was the perfect ending to a damn good meal. It was light on top and the bottom had a toasted crust that's reminiscent of a glazed donut. The service was awesome, and the ambiance was hip, something that you don't find very much of in this city.",

First service:  the guys and gals working the front of the restaurant were cheerful and seemed to be happy working at this establishment.  The food was the best I had during my celebration this includes eating at Hugo's Cellar (very good), Three Gorges Grill (good), Park on the Fremont (mediocre).  The Veal meatballs were the best meatballs I've ever had.  The Killer Shimp was the best shrimp dish I have ever had.  I will never miss the opportunity to visit Carson's Kitchen when I visit Las Vegas.  IF you are staying at the strip, I would highly recommend grabbing a rideshare and visiting the restaurant.",

Truly wish I could order an endless amount. I had it with a side of Rainbow Cauliflower which was a mistake on my end. That is the only thing wrong with this place. I enjoyed a drink of a special of theirs called Towns End. It's a twist on an old fashioned. It was good but nothing to brag about. But when it comes to bragging. They have something I feel they don't brag enough about. This one dessert called the Bourbon brownie. Simply just wow. That's all you can say. The brownie is just so rich and the hints of bourbon are balanced just well enough where they don't overpower the ice cream or the chocolate. It is a must get!",

Attempted to make a reservation but they only take reservations for large parties. No big deal.  So we walked in and was told there would be a 45 minute wait.  Place looked full and it's not particularly big.  There's a bar inside and one on the roof. Waiting area was outside in a courtyard/lounge type area.  So we headed to the roof, grabbed a drink, and proceeded to chill in the courtyard. A couple drinks later we were seated inside.  Placed our food order and another round of drinks. Started off with the chicken skins which were a crunchy delight of fried goodness. Wife ordered the green beans which were as tasty as a green bean could be. I ordered the Secret Sunday chicken sandwich, which was one darn good tasting sandwich. The accompanying tater tots were consumed by the wife so I'm assuming that they were just as delicious. My bro ordered the blackened Chilean sea bass and that thing was damn tasty. Perfectly cooked which the right amount of crispness on the blackened side.  We finished the night with the bread pudding which was on point as any dessert should be. The waitress was cool,  friendly, and attentive. Don't particularly remember her name but she was excellent.",

Not a full 5 stars for me because I thought their drink menu was more extensive than their food menu.  The menu is designed for sharing and that we did.. I'm not a fan of chicken skin, or animal skin of any kind but I took a little nibble just to say I tried it; flavors were great, almost bacon-like.  Mac and cheese was my absolute favorite, rich and delicious.  With a dual outdoor patios, one upstairs and down, it really rounds out the extension of the restaurant.   All in all, Carson's kitchen is worth a try and I definitely will be a repeat offender.",

The menu is varied and unique, lots of interesting food combinations, but executed well.  Cocktails were stiff and did the trick.

    "text": "I really loved the vibe of this place.  Really hard to find, but once you do, you forget where this place is located.  The waiting patio was awesome...not packed in like sardines...it turned a wait into a nice visit.  I had already pre-gamed this place before we ever got to Vegas, so I knew we were going to have the bacon jam, the chicken skins, and the glazed donut bread pudding.  All of those were great, but I think my mac & cheese and my hubby's butter burger with tots were headliners as well.  I will say I thought the chicken skins would have had more flavor...probably wouldn't get those again but I did enjoy them, and my hubby loved them.  You have got to go here, whether you're a local or a visitor like us.  Will have to try to fit it in on our next visit in March.",

The service was impeccable, but not sure if it just is, or because they gave us a table if we promised not to linger. We received attentive service with food, removing plates, refilling drinks. It was reserved for someone arriving in an hour. Either way we ate, and didn't linger, since they didn't make us wait an hour for a table.  Would eat here again!",

The mushroom flatbread was earthy and had a creamy bechamel sauce. Another little gem was their black rice oxtail risotto. It had the perfect bite and ended with a Parmesan taste.

The menu is diverse with a little bit of everything but my favs are easily the gyro tacos, mushroom flat break, and the butter burger. Each time ive come here the service has been spot on, as well as the quality of food. Sitting at the bar area in front of the kitchen is quite a spectacle if you are not in the food service industry. I am not, and it amazes me how well they coordinate getting everything out so well and in such a timely manner with little to no mistakes. Do visit Carson and appreciate the good food they are bring to us in the downtown area.... thanks guy ill be back.",

Sure, different menu items, but it felt like they had dialed things in a bit and the sliders and the deviled eggs that we had were really really good.   To top if off, the people working there are extremely friendly and on top of their game, overall I would say this is a really great addition to downtown fare and you should definitely check it out, especially if you're looking for a new lunch spot.",

Wonderful welcomes await you with friendly servers and front of the house staff. But first, this place is small, and I'm sure gets busy. It's worth every minute you would have to wait! So be patient and await with a drink! We ordered small plates and the Butter Burger. The Burnt Ends come with an out of this world ranch, homemade pickles and leaves you wanting three more orders, even though the portion is generous! So amazing! We enjoyed the Devil Eggs and a Beet Salad that came with delicious morsels of goat cheese....I cannot explain the perfection and explosion of flavors in every bite! My husbands Butter Burger was extraordinary, juicy perfection with homemade cheese.   I'm gushing, however this rad place deserves so much more! We will be stopping again on our way home! Bravo!!!",

We showed up on time and were seated about 20 minutes later. Not a big deal since they had a great outdoor fire lounging area for us.  Once we were seated, our server, I can't remember her name, but she could be Gwen Stefani's sister, seemed on her game and said she won't forget anything because we'll order then she'll repeat it back to us...which she did.  We were warned that food came out randomly about every 6 minutes and they encourage sharing plates. Fine. However, first, not all plates are shareable with 8 people. Sandwiches and burgers and certain salads are not shareable. That being expected is simply ridiculous. Second, Food came out 20,30 and 60 minutes apart. That's insane. The server suggested if we wanted protein in the much talked about Mac n cheese, to add the meatballs. Perfect. So meatballs came out promptly, then the Mac followed about 35-45 minutes later.  YEP. Great recommendation server! To top off the already late dishes, everyone ate except our friend with a chicken salad. First being told \"the chicken takes a long time to marinate\" This is almost an hour after originally ordering.  Finally The server said \"someone forgot\" and she would comp the salad because she \"didn't even care\"  Still, 30 plus minutes goes by without it and I can't help but wonder if it was because the cook was playing \"finger drums\" in the back. The salad arrived, we cheered and the hostess seemed annoyed and said \"frankly, it was because your server forgot to order it\". Nice team work! No one takes ownership, just blames or throws you under and made us feel like the jerks because WE should have expected that due to their expediting technique. The infamous salad was wonderful, so our friend said. We left with pleased palates but service was considerably less than our expectations.  If you want good food, go. Just leave all other expectations at the door.",

    "text": "Carson kitchen definitely put a lots of effort and attention into their food.   We shared the bacon jam and brie to start and it was delicious and different! The shrimps had a nice crisp and flavor also.  I ordered the chicken thighs with apricot and it was beautifully made and flavored. All my friends also had great food which were all beautifully decorated. The only dish I didn't like was the tahini carrots, the carrots weren't cooked all the way through I believe to keep some crunchiness and generally tasted like vinegar to me, but that might be just a personal preference.  The service was friendly and attentive, shame that they didn't let us split the bill. One of my friend ended paying the bill for all until we sort it out. Not the kind of headache you want to have when you enjoy lunch with some friends.",

I loved being able to see how everyone from the chef to the servers worked together to bring everyone their meal.   I didn't want anything heavy, so I settled on a yummy sounding bourbon fudge brownie. The saltiness of the bacon contrasts well with the chocolatey brownie and sweet ice cream. I practically inhaled this it was so good.",

I would definitely give this place five stars for the ambiance, the cool vibe and super friendly staff. Matt the co-owner greeted us personally and showed us the rooftop we reserved for the evening. There are five heaters up there and a private bar. The drinks were awesome.  In order to accomodate a large group we were asked to choose a pre-set menu and it would be served family style. My one and only complaint is the portion size. The plates are very small. The beet salad had half of one beet cut up with four tiny balls of cheese. We got one plate to share for every five to six people.... everything came out at a different time so you were perpetually hungry and your plate was always empty. The ox tail rissoto which is fantastic has enough in the plate for one tablespoon per person, you can get two small pieces of cauliflower and a tiny sliver of chicken.... The only course where the portion size was appropriate for the guest count was dessert.   Every single person commented that the food was delicious but they were still hungry. Many ended up going out to eat after dinner.  That's not what you want when you pay aprox $128 per person. There was one exception, the girl that is vegan. I think because they had to alter several dishes  she ended up with a satisfying amount of food.",

I have been trying to get into this place for years but every time I'm downtown, it is super busy and now I know why; this place is fantastic!  Be warned though that they do not take reservations so you either have to come on a slow day or during a slow time.    Here's a review of the items we got:  Killer Shrimp:  Delicious.  Imagine bang bang shrimp from Bonefish Grill but add a few pickled peppers.  The creaminess and the slight spiciness makes the bowl totally lickable. Crispy Chicken Skins:  Addictive!  The skins are fried really crispy and dusted with a special seasoning blend so good you could sell it on the corner downtown.  Dip these bad boys in honey and you've got yourself a real treat! Black Rice and Oxtail Risotto:  Not bad.  This was our least favorite dish.  The texture and the taste seemed just a bit off.  The dish almost didn't get finished, almost. Meatloaf patty melt and tater tots:  This was delectable/  So juicy, so crispy, so savory!  I needed this to be bigger but luckily it also came with the best tater tots I've ever had!  They too wee dusted with the same seasoning blend that was on the chicken skins. Jerky Turkey Burger and Secret Sunday Chicken sandwich:  I unfortunately did not get to try these but my buddies told me they were fantastic.  The turkey burger came with a sweet and spicy chutney and the chicken sandwich came was dusted with that amazing seasoning blend.  Both of course came with those heavenly tater tots.    I will definitely be going back and hopefully soon because I want to try literally everything else on their menu!",

The service is fine. Everyone is very nice. It is downtown with a convenient location with parking available. The problem for me is that it seems like the menus change depending on either the season or what is available. The last time that I was here, they had an amazing array of small plates/salads, including the most amazing watermelon feta salad. I specifically came here today hoping to get that salad again, as well as other small plates they had the last time. Sadly, it was not on the menu. I did order the beet salad with mandarin oranges and it was quite yummy although small. Due to not really liking what was available on the menu otherwise, I also ordered the sea bass ( I prefer vegetarian/vegan yet will also eat fish). It was a disappointment for me. It was very plain and I could make a way better one in my kitchen, at home, esp at $22.00 for the small plate. My friend ordered the flat bread with mushrooms and Tikka Masala. It was a little bit on the spicy side but I just wasn't blown away. I would never order this flat bread again. She also ordered the tater tot's and they were not only on the spicy side but way over seasoned. The bill came out to about $64 with tax, and that included one beer.  I am not sure I want to take another chance unless I preview the menu before going there to make sure that the items on the menu are those that I would like to eat. Otherwise, today was more of a thumbs down for me which is a real bummer, as I really liked this restaurant the first time I went there. This place went from being amazing to very average and easy to forget.",

We were led to this gem of a place just a short walk of where we were already so it was perfect. We ordered the Deviled Eggs, Young Beets, and the Gyro Tacos. My favorite was definitely the beets. We so wanted to return during our stay so we could try out the dinner options but unfortunately we couldn't find the time. It is definitely on our list for the next time we are in Vegas however!",

    "text": "Carson Kitchen has been on my list for a very long time. It pains me to miss it for the past 3 times I've been in town due to conflicting schedules...ok....so it's really because my friends and I are always so hungover and lazy to make the drive from Henderson to downtown. Don't judge, it's Vegas folks.  Fast forward to 2018 and my crying about losing too much money at the Golden Nugget. Wanting to drown my sorrows in good food and libations, I dragged my poor friend in 100+ degrees scorching weather to go on a walking mission to find Carson Kitchen. After about 30mins getting lost, endlessly dropping f-bombs and getting sunburned, we managed to find this kickass air-conditioned oasis in Downtown.   THE MAGARIAN ($13): Refreshing blend of Aviation Gin, fresh lemon juice, thyme and cucumber soda. There was a subtle sweetness to it, possibly honey. I likey. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2Deerg3&s=9ca5f5fbeb9b76b797b6c3b954e9732c48251c987940573afd5e27623fa623aa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2Deerg3</a>  SIMON SAYS SANGRIA ($10): White wine, pureed peach and sparkling wine. - Our server suggested this popular cocktail for me because I told her I wanted to try something different than my usual Vodka-Soda.  - It was way too sweet for me, not my cup of tea. I stuck with countless chilled vodka shots and vodka-soda for the rest of our meal, lol.   CRISPY CHICKEN SKIN w/smoked honey dip ($9):  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2EQ9pIk&s=cf724316124f6d30ed61d1ada4c8f31d98e893c6f813c6641bbbabf413d26f06\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2EQ9pIk</a> <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2PEb1sV&s=4dca0aaecaaf0768e13763939b2b3e32fa7ed64379721d7c607becef5784d68d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2PEb1sV</a> THIS was the sole reason why I bookmarked Carson Kitchen and it definitely did not disappoint! We loved it so much that we ordered 2! - Addictingly fried chicken skin chips that you just can't put down until the basket is completely empty. Oh yes, you bet yer ass I licked those crumbs. - The smoked honey laced with cayenne pairs so well with the saltiness of these fried delights.  - Did I mention that they were GLUTEN-FREE? You're welcome.   DEVIL'S EGGS ($8 for 2 eggs):  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2OeEzIE&s=abd86ded66f988c7ead134233434259aecacaa9edd23497c302a817cae5384fb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2OeEzIE</a> The best deviled eggs I've had yet.  So velvety-whipped and melts in your mouth.  The garnishing of crispy pancetta and black tobiko (flying fish roe dyed w/squid ink) takes it to a whole 'nother tasty level, in terms of savoriness and texture.   KILLER SHRIMP ($13): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2CSgKUU&s=2802e4d36e90bfe82ccb2ecf2677d1fbe1d314c6e8cf5956b38eab5d3fd396f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2CSgKUU</a> Menu listed it as being fried shrimp coated in a rocoto and aji amarillo cream sauce (orange and red chilies that resembles bell peppers). All I tasted was a sweet mayo-like sauce, reminds me a lot like the \"dynamite\"/kewpie mayo you'd find on your sauced up sushi rolls. Too rich and not a big hit for us.  LAMB SPIEDIES w/tater tots ($15): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2JwqNk4&s=fca0c46fa32f7443441524781565b1a100e6a47d36a0d100d1710bc1a973e4f4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2JwqNk4</a> Ground lamb sausage on a french roll. Overall, it was just ok. - The giardiniera (melange of pickled veggies) was crisp and tangy but it was a bit messy to eat. The garlic aioli could use more garlic.  RAINBOW CAULIFLOWER ($10): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2PwgQIC&s=e71c0f73686b7c7ad0838190fee873e338b8476f5c28dcb798caab0681687110\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2PwgQIC</a> Very pleasantly surprised by this simple yet delicious plate of veggieterribles. Cooked to perfection with just simple seasoning of garlic and lemon juice. I'd definitely order it again.  COCOA-ESPRESSO NY STEAK ($20): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2yFp5sg&s=b5bf659f347814cdde7eb9878225a61983ea360bc21b8efd8eb0a07634885a90\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2yFp5sg</a> Bras off to the chef because this was a pretty well-executed hunk of delectable beef! So tender and juicy, I couldn't stop eating it. Served on its own without any sides, but so worth the money!  - The cocoa-espresso crust on the steak was deliciously genius and not at all overwhelming. The rich buttery red wine demi-glace added a nice savory-sweetness to the overall dish.   Carson Kitchen, I lub you long time.   Hours:  Mon-Wed & Sun 11:30am-10pm; Thur-Sat 11:30am- 11pm  Parking:  - Street parking, if you're lucky. - There's a paid lot for $2/hr (free on holidays) across the street.",

And my lunch that Thursday afternoon made my trip.  What I had wasn't important, I watched them prepare everything as though they were preparing for someone they loved.  What more can be asked of a restaurant.   All I can say is go!  If you have to wait, then wait and enjoy.  You won't regret it!",

    "text": "This is my new favorite place in Las Vegas. It is located right off of Fremont Street and if you did not know it was there, you could not find it. There's not a sign outside and the street on which this sits is not busy. I almost missed it during my first trip there. Yet, the restaurant stays really busy. It's a great local favorite.   The menu is nice and has dishes intended to be shared in an American version of tapas. I always get the Espresso Crusted New York strip and the Oxtail Risotto. I have also tried several drinks and desserts and have never been disappointed. I think I would come back again and again just for the Oxtail Risotto. I don't share it anymore. If you want some, you have to get your own bowl, even though the serving is large.   The open kitchen is a nice touch. It allows guests to watch as the food is being prepared and let's you have some slight interaction with the chefs. Service is good and food delivery is prompt. My only recommendation is that you should not miss this place, so do yourself a favor and make a reservation ahead of time. Especially if you are only in town for a little while.",

    "text": "Long, some might venture to say too long, on my list of restaurants to visit, we finally arrived at its doorsteps on a recent Thursday night finding it quite busy and, might I say, noisy.  No reservations are accepted though our hostess found us an unoccupied table in a shade under 2 minutes.    We decided to get our motors runnin' while looking for adventure by starting the meal with an appetizer of bacon jam and brie accompanied by toasted baguette rounds.  The only problem was the wait, and wait you  must, for the bacon jam to cool so you will not ignite your palate.  Tic, toc, tic, toc, toc, tic. It is time to scoop out a sizeable portion, smear heavily on the baguette and savor.  Repeat again and again until every delicious morsel has been consumed.   Our Brussels sprouts Caesar salad was likely healthier though registering far lower on the flavor scale so it won't be receiving an invite to join us on next visit.  Lastly, both my wife and I each ordered the sea bass entree with chili oil and topped by an interesting cauliflower tabbouleh that proved to be quite enjoyable.",

Friendly and efficient service, excellent, tasty food, we can't wait to return. If you go, you must try the bacon jam dish.",

The deviled eggs were the highlight of the meal and I don't even like eggs, but everything else we got was either alright, or worse.   Short rib sliders- overly sweet and dry  Bacon jam - good, but only comes with enough bread to eat a third of it, either lower the portion and price, or more bread  Empanadas - something about the sauce I didn't agree with, also on the sweet side  I would also recommend going with 4 or more people, seems like that would work out better with the small plate aspect of the menu",

    "text": "We tried this on a recommendation.  It's not quite in the heart of the bustling Fremont crowd, which surprised me, but later, I was quite thankful for that.  You're close enough to walk to the Fremont craziness but about 1-2 blocks away, enough to make an easier arrival/escape.  We were escorted to a cute little courtyard waiting area, which was cool.  It looked like there were tables downstairs and upstairs (outdoor area upstairs?) although I never saw stairs inside.  The downstairs is all I saw.  It was small but had an energy about it.  1) Bacon Jam (baked brie w/ toasted baguette) = 5/5 (sweet and salty and spicy and sour all at the same time, very complex flavors made this very unique 2) Tempura Green Beans (pepper jelly cream cheese) = 5/5 (so glad my co-diner ordered this, the red pepper cream cheese was so tasty) 3) Baked Mac & Cheese = 4.5/5 (pretty darn good, solid mac n cheese) 4) Butter Burger = 5/5 (such a good burger, moist, unique flavors, seasoned well, melty cheese, yummy sauce)  I will say we each ordered a burger (which he told us was a full meal w/ spicy tots - also very good) and shared the bacon jam, tempura beans, and mac n cheese.  This was WAY too much food for four people!!  We loved our three shared items so much and think we should order 1 cheeseburger as a shared item as well instead of a whole burger for each of us.  Very high recommendation for this place.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place.  It's got such great Yelp reviews. Well unfortunately this Yelp lead me wrong and we are not impressed.    Walking in, the decor was nice. I liked the communal tables.  The host was a good looking guy but seems grumpy.  Didn't smile once while we were looking over the menu.    We usually like the bar so decided to sit there.  It was about 430 and relatively quiet.  You would they would have even more time to be attentive.  Wrong.  The guy behind the bar was busy the whole time stacking glasses and stocking beer.  Felt like we walked in too early and before they opened or something.  He was rushing to get everything done.  He did take our order and our food came out in reasonable time but serving us was more of an afterthought.   This would have been ok if the food lived up to 4 stars and it did not.  Everything was over salted.  We ordered the tempura green beans and oxtail risotto based on good review.  Green beans was ok, crispy but some were salty.  Felt like someone put salt at the end but didn't spread it even. First bite or the oxtail risotto was good.  A burst of flavor and richness.  Unfortunately more bites made us realized it was also over seasoned.   I asked for a slice of bread to eat with it. and he said he had to charge me.  That's okay.  Bread came with butter toasted and also some salt.  Why would you put salt on bread?  Needless to say, we were not impressed and walked away with a salty after taste.  It was a far cry from the Therapy dinner we had last night.  We will not be back.",

    "text": "Where to begin... My girlfriend and I walked through the door and immediately was looked up and down by the hostess and she simply said \"you guys can sit at the community table or, the bar\" we didn't get asked or given the option of a table. We chose the bar because sitting at a random table with other people was not too romantic, nor did I want to meet anyone new that day. At the bar we were never greeted or asked what we would like to drink. The bartender finally walked over 8 steps to us and handed us a menu and walked off, I had to ask someone else that worked there if we could at least get a water.   We were told by the female bartender that everything that is cooked/made to order and meant to share. She also said the food is brought out as it is ready and would not come out at the same time... NOT A PROBLEM! We ordered the Ox tail risotto and a burger. The risotto came out within 10 minutes of us ordering it. Not impressed with the taste and it seemed like it was cooked in a crock pot earlier that morning and NOT MADE TO ORDER. My burger however, is a whole other story. We were done with the risotto within 20+ minutes and still no burger! I asked the bartender if the burger was coming out soon and she said she would go check. She came back and said nothing to us about the burger eta. Then the cook came out and from 15 feet away and within earshot of the whole bar and said \"10 minutes on the burger\" and the bartender turned to us and said \"it will be right out\". Now I've cooked burgers over 1000+ times in my life and if I cooked a burger for 30+ minutes it would come out a hockey puck.   I had enough and stood up and walked out. My girlfriend and I never got an apology or asked if there was something they could do. Horrible service, food sucked (I unfortunately never got to take a bite outta the burger), we will NEVER recommend that horrible place!",

We ordered the burnt ends, bacon jam, and fried chicken skin - and that hit the spot for us two. Manny was our server, was super nice and had great recommendations regarding the menu items. First, the burnt ends were a perfect balance of crispy charred fat and meat, and the sauce wasn't too sweet. Perfect. Second, the bacon jam was a balanced blend of seasoned sweet and savory without a sugary overkill. And third, the fried chicken skin is probably the best you'll find in Las Vegas. We order this everywhere, and Carson Kitchen has everyone beat. This is a must-visit.",

First off, the customer service was phenomenal. My friend and I were wow'd by how all of the staff asked us if we needed help, offered suggestions, and overall super friendly. There was a 15 minute wait so they offered to show us to the patio in the back where we found a little oasis in the Fremont area of LV. A great fire bowl and chairs, not to mention a rooftop bar. We didn't mind the wait at all!   After were we called to our seats were were happy to see that we could see into the open kitchen and watch the busy staff prepare beautiful plates. The manager checked on us throughout the evening knowing it was our first time to dine with them. I was very impressed when he noticed a family trying to take a photo on the patio. He ran out to the patio and took the family photo for them then back inside to greet guest. Top notch.   The food did not disappoint at all. We decided to share a few plates so we could try out a few options. Our server suggested the chicken skins, devil's eggs, and baked brie with bacon jam. All three were spectacular.   If you want something local, yummy, and off the beaten path take a short walk to Carson Kitchen. You will not be disappointed.",

I've been here twice, and sadly, the first time was a definite 5 stars, but my second visit has brought it down to 4 stars. Hence, I'm having a hard time how to write this review.   Bacon jam with baguette- 5 stars on first try, but went down to a 3 for me. Second visit, the bacon jam was waaaaay sweeter, and it almost ruined it for me since I had been obsessing over it for months.   Crispy chicken skins- 3 stars. This stuff is good, but I've definitely had better.   Tempura green beans- 5 stars on first visit, but went down to 4 stars on second.   Rainbow Caultiflower- 5 stars all the way. This stuff is sooooo good, I wish I could eat it everyday. Unfortunately, they were out on my second visit.   Glazed donut bread pudding- 3 stars. I wasn't too fond of the flavors or the texture. It was good, but nothing special.   Wine berry shortcake- 4 stars. Loved the hint of lavender in the whip cream.   I love the style of this place. It's definitely \"hip.\" And the open kitchen layout on the first floor is really cool.  The chef was very friendly, and all waitstaff are always on top of their game.   I'll definitely be back for the rainbow cauliflower and I'll give the bacon jam one more shot.",

Veal Meatballs in Cream Sauce were savory and tasty.  But I wasn't that fond of Crispy Chicken Skins, which were like Pork Rind.  But they tasted better dipped in very silky Smoked Honey.  Baked Mac & Cheese with Parmesan splinters were good, and Fingerling Potatoes excellent.  Grilled Rainbow Cauliflower was colorful but tasted no different than regular white cauliflower.  Bacon Jam Brie was rich and unique.  Short Rib Stroganoff with Cognac, Button and Portabello Mushrooms, and spinach was very good.  And homemade Tater Tots were great.  The contemporary decor and tableware here are quite inventive.  Our server did not check on my party of four much, so we had to ultimately forego dessert and ask the manager for the checks to avoid missing a play at the Smith Center.    This place has fine food!  XXXX-1/2 stars overall!",

We sat at the chefs table and ordered beverages and had to order the bacon jam with brie upon the suggestion of other Yelpers and our server. The bacon jam was amazing and has my vote for best appetizer, the brie baked right in really makes the dish.   I chose the butter burger and it was very good, the only thing is the tomato didn't have salt or pepper so the tomato flavor really wasn't coming out, but that's a minor complaint.   Dessert was really good and one must check out the mirrors in the restrooms as they are so cute.   GO to Carson Kitchen!",

    "text": "High marks for flavor of the food however the staff needs to get an understanding of good hygiene while in the food service industry.   This was my second time having a late lunch here. This time around the bartender seemed to be the waiter at all the tables so he was needless to say \"very busy\" we were created and seated promptly by the hostess. As we sat the bartender is passing behind us and mudders to hisself f@$k, I'm guessing because he was so busy. The hostess got us some waters and said that the waiter would be with us. About 5 minutes pass and he comes by says hello and asked if we were ready.   I ordered an iced tea and the other person with me asked for raspberry iced tea he responded in an almost annoyed fashion I don't have raspberry iced tea, so we order lemonade. We order a starter and two other main dishes.   The shrimp platter came out first which was a main dish followed about 3 minutes later with the gyro tacos which was the starter and then about 5 minutes later the turkey burger which was the other main dish. Seems the waiter should ask and deliver instructions to the kitchen so guests get the food as they are expecting.   My main concern was the hygiene the hostess was trying to help out the waiter by delivering some food and helping with drinks however the almost to the crotch shorts seemed to be causing her a problem so she had to keep reaching to her inner thigh and pulling them down. The other was which seemed to be a manager figure wearing a button down shirt and sweatpants, he would play with his mustache and sole patch rub his eyes and face then grab a plate from the kitchen and deliver it to a table. The other lady at the kitchen counter did a good job as well as the kitchen staff. The other manager figure there delivered one of our plates to us and was very professional.   The food is a little over priced however great marks on flavor so great job to the kitchen staff.   The employees and managers should be a little more mindful of cleanliness.   Would like to come back but would need a very good reason as there are other establishments to spend my money.",

    "text": "Excellent service.  I won't be back for the food though.  Ordered the following:  Devil's Eggs: basically 6 deviled eggs with a sprinkling of black caviar and crunchy pancetta bits replacing the paprika.  I love deviled eggs and this version tasted okay, but I couldn't help thinking that real deviled eggs have more flavor, because of the spice from the paprika.  This version was just salty, and the egg filling was a little on the dry side as well.  The pancetta was the best part.  The caviar didn't have much of a flavor impact.  I think I would have been more impressed with the dish if they had replaced the black caviar with Japanese flying fish roe or salmon roe and added a drop of spicy sauce as well, because Japanese roe has that poppy texture that was missing with the black caviar.  Plus it's orange, so the presentation would be more exciting, more of a play on the traditional deviled eggs.   Roasted beet salad: the description sounded good but the flavors did not meld well for me.  Besides the beets, it had mandarin oranges, goat cheese, pistachios.  I think it would have tasted better if the beets were sliced thinner instead of in big chunks, and maybe if the pistachios were replaced with candied walnuts or pecans.    Rainbow Cauliflower: I prefer roasted cauliflower to whatever they did to this cauliflower.  Roasted cauliflower is more tender and the olive oil carmelizes, bringing out the natural sweetness of the cauliflower.  This version had no sweetness, only salt.  I didn't taste much or any garlic and lemon, which is what other reviewers have raved about.  And the cauliflower was still very crunchy.  It was another miss for me.  Hmm...looking at the photos other people have posted on Yelp, I see that I didn't get nearly as much caviar on my eggs as others did.  It really was just a sprinkling, whereas I saw in one photo that it was piled on.  I wonder if I caught the kitchen on an off night.",

When we arrived at the restaurant I was not sure I was at the right place at first. The front of the restaurant blends in with the block . As we walked in we noticed that the restaurant was full and busy at 7pm on a Friday night. I was with a group of 12 people. We had water at our table served to us right away and we were given wonderful, attentive service by the staff. Water is so important because it was about 114 degrees last night.The menu was explained as well as the \"cook to order style\" Our food was served quick and with a smile. Whatever you ordered you get as soon as its ready. The food is hot, fresh and seasonal. Each entree is made to share or not share if you choose. I ordered the rainbow cauliflower, it was excellent! I cant wait to try to duplicate this dish at home. I also ordered the Veal meatballs, excellent as well. I thought the cream sauce and the peas were a nice touch. I sampled other dishes like the fried chicken skins,very good for those that like chicken skin. I had a great dinning experience and I am looking forward to going back. A special shout out to our server who went above and beyond for our group last night, thanks again for your great service.",

    "text": "Came here with a group of friends, seven of us total, and had we not made a reservation, it might have been tough to fit, so if you've got a group, think ahead. Disclaimer: I'm vegetarian with an egg allergy, so my access to the menu was pretty limited, and that's all I've got to go on for the review.  The food was decent, but struck me as a bit vinegar-heavy. The dishes were ordered to be shared, and of what was ordered at the table I had the Mushroom Ceviche, the Roasted Young Beets salad, and the Rainbow Cauliflower. I would probably have loved the flatbread and the tempura green beans, but both have egg in them, alas. (And then had to deal with delicious-looking green beans being dangled in front of me because the table ordered not one, but TWO orders of it. It's apparently quite good.) Of what I ordered, the Roasted Young Beets was my favorite, but was similar to roasted beet salads I've had elsewhere. The mushroom ceviche was nice, but a smidge more vinegar-laden than I would have liked, but then again, maybe that's a ceviche thing--I haven't had any previous experience with ceviche, so I had no idea what to expect going into that dish. The Rainbow Cauliflower was oddly and inexplicably vinegar-y tasting when it should have been more lemony, so I'm wondering if maybe having the ceviche where I could smell it was affecting my ability to truly taste it. The cauliflower was ultimately abandoned by the rest of the table in lieu of other things, so it kind of fell flat for us (I finished it anyway, though; I usually love cauliflower).  From what I remember of what the non-vegetarians ordered, they had the Cocoa Espresso NY Strip, the Bone-In Pork Belly, the Tempura Green Beans, the Baked Mac & Cheese, the Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto, and I believe an order of The Devil's Eggs. Of these, a second green beans was ordered and the mac & cheese and the risotto disappeared fairly quickly. I seem to recall a lot of anticipation for the pork belly that didn't quite appear to deliver, but I do believe the ones that had the deviled egg liked it. Again, I am not sure. They also got a Bourbon Fudge Brownie to share for dessert, which didn't go over well with the ones that don't appreciate salt in their sweets and weirded out Mr. Piano a little with the bacon ice cream. I'm mostly just mentioning this in case it's helpful; it doesn't make sense to work any of the stuff I couldn't try into my rating.  The service, however, is top notch! Our waitress Felicia was really friendly, great with making recommendations (including recommendations for my dietary restrictions & allergy), and seemed to really enjoy working there, which can be a real breath of fresh air :) She also had some fun recommendations for things to do or see around town, which was nice of her. The setting of the restaurant itself is pretty tastefully done and I like the decor--it's a cute place.  Overall, really awesome service, but they need more (and perhaps better) options for vegetarians/vegans, or they need to make the options that sound like they'd be vegetarian/vegan actually be so. I had previewed the menu before we came, and thought there was more I could eat, like the flatbread. Also, a good traditional tempura batter can easily be vegan, so there's really no reason to have people making sad eyes at crispy, delicious green beans that they can't eat, guys :( I'd probably be okay eating here again if I found myself in Vegas again with friends who wanted to go, but I'd have to have a snack first. Or hit up O-Face Donuts next door immediately afterwards (vegan donuts).",

The food is what sets this restaurant apart.  I absolutely love the creative ways they approach their menu.  The gyro tacos, veal meatballs and the FGT sliders are a personal favorite! Their cocktails and beer list are great and I absolutely love their roof top space for hanging out.  Anytime I get to Vegas, I always try to stop in at Carson Kitchen for its fabulous food, great location and yummy cocktails!",

Wife had turkey burger which was a bit spicy but very good, I had the chicken sandwich and both came with excellent tater tots. We sat at bar looking into kitchen and was amazed how well the staff works together and quite efficient. Their personalities and communication was great. Great staff. And with the kitchen view we got to see many great dishes go out. So we went back following day for lunch we had the lamb tacos, mushroom flatbread pizza, and the tempura green beans with an awesome sauce, and again very satisfied with everything and awesome staff next day to. Great to find a place like this, and everything that leaves the kitchen looks very appetizing.",

The atmosphere and service...just everything was really good! The only complaint I have is most of the food is sold separately, which you can share the sides, but because of that the bill was pretty hefty...I'd say it's a bit overpriced.

I asked the waitress to repeat it and she laughed. Like its  a joke that you expect my 16 month old to stay seated at a booth. I was shocked at her overall lack of care about the situation- she walked back to the hostess stand to begin laughing with her coworkers again- we left- and they didnt mind- don't worry owners- you can have your empty restaurant and rude staff- I took my $250 dinner tab elsewhere",

We had the bacon jam with baguette slices, the gyro tacos, the turkey burger with mango chutney slaw, and the oxtail risotto. For dessert, we had the donut bread pudding. Seriously, the best of everything ever. If you're within 100 miles of this place you have to go. I split the bacon jam and gyro tacos with my fiance, and then had the turkey burger. I would say, if the staff is reading this, the only thing I would change is a different side dish on the turkey burger. The tater tots are \"okay\", but with everything else tasting so amazing there has to be something better. My suggestion would be sweet potato fries with honey to dip them in. Just my $.02 but otherwise sooo good!",

There were 7 of us and we were seated quickly upstairs on there rooftop patio. We ordered tons of things. Oxtail Risotto which was superb, blackened sea bass had lots of flavor and cooked perfect. Veal meatballs were delicious. They had a nice sauce and were served with peas. The tempura green beans were fabulous. The ribeye was interesting it was served with a cocoa sauce which went great with it. The falafel sliders was amazing! My favorite was the gyro tacos. They had so much flavor. Too bad you only get three of them. The service was great and prompt. The bring your check out in a book, which I thought was so cool. All in all wonderful experience! Highly recommend!",

Whatever questions we asked about the menu or any unusual requests we made (truffle ketchup), he delivered. In fact, everyone working here was great.

When you add in the price being better than you'd expect for this experience, let alone for a high-end place, this is perfection.  When you experience yourself, check in with Matt. He makes the experience enjoyable and will be sure you are well taking care of.  Thank you for making your Buffalo Burger's lettuce wraps for us, Matt!",

The food is delicious - they've got just the right mix of familiar comforts like Mac & cheese and deviled eggs, plus food with a twist like crispy chicken skins, black mussels and banoffee pie. We got there early on a Friday night to beat the crowd. Even when it got busy, our server, the staff and manager were great!",

From the chicken skin dipped in honey to the tater tots that came with the short rib sliders, I can't really say anything disappointed me. We sat at the bar and our bartender was attentive the whole time and gave us amazing recommendations. It was a hot day and I wanted something refreshing and The Margarian hit the spot (Gin-based with cucumber soda). I'm glad she convinced us to get the donut bread pudding, too. Loved the music they were playing in here and the overall vibe of the place. Reminds me of San Francisco... without the long wait and paying $4/hour for parking.",

It's one of my favorite spots in Vegas and where I take friends from out of town to get a taste of LV off the strip. I've sampled almost all of the small plates and a number of mains and sandwiches and I'm always pleased.  My favorites include the gyro tacos, chicken skins, veal meatballs, chicken sandwich, lamb chops and mac and cheese.   The drinks are on the pricey side and if we go alcohol free, we walk out feeling like it was a great deal. Otherwise, it does get more expensive, but still a good deal.  A group of six with drinks and it was in the mid $300s. Not bad for a great dining and sure to impress experience!",

It's a small setting with a \"hipster\" feel in a rough feeling area. While the food was great, the staff was, well.... we sat at a large counter near the kitchen. While it was interesting to see how the kitchen operated, the spiky-haired manager (I'm assuming, he seemed to think he ran things) kept getting into arguments with the female cook (who kept smiling and not telling him to go f himself). He dropped the f-bomb three times that I could hear. And being that we were sitting on the corner near their prep area, it was like he was standing at the counter with us the entire time we were there. Even apologized once and thanked for us putting up with him. That, coupled with the fact that one of the waitresses came over and reached for something in a storage compartment above my head, totally putting both her armpits in my face from six inches away, and the location make me give it 3 stars. Food is 5 star quality though.",

First-off, all beers here are bottled (if this matters to you read-on; if not, what is wrong with you? :) Coming from San Diego, gastro pubs serving locally-sourced brews on-tap alongside locally sourced eats are everywhere. Carson's menu is begging for locally-sourced brews to accompany the menu's eclectic fare. As for the menu, the Jam/Brie is spot-on; the Fried Chicken Skins satisfied at '2-bites and done' (it's deep fried chicken skin and nothing else!) and the Butter Burger was above average. Blown away post-eats? Hardly. Would I return? Absolutely, to further sample the menu. Plus, LV is seriously lacking at eateries on this level of hip, urbane, fun fare. Felicia behind the bar took good care of us, too. She's personable, professional and exudes good energy. One or two other staffers (dudes in dated 70's and 80's rock tees) not so much ;) Hip is one thing; douche another. Lighten-up, guys, and engage your guests. 4-stars.",

I'm docking a star for service.  The food was awesome.  Tried the broccoli salad, bacon jam, butter burger, steak, and the bread pudding.    Broccoli salad - wonderful mix of sweet, sour, crunchy, and creamy.  Refreshing.  Burger and steak were cooked perfectly - medium rare, just the way we like.  (Medium rare meaning red in the middle, you have no idea how hard it is for people to get medium rare right).  Bacon jam was so smokey and slightly sweet - just wish they weren't so chintzy about the brie and bread.  I mean, 5 pieces of bread for all the jam??  Come on, now.   The interior is very industrial-y, raw material-y feeling.  Very unique.  We were catching Book of Mormon after dinner and let our bartender know.  We sat at the bar as there was no other seating when we arrived.  We let her know when we first sat down and she promised she would get us out of there in time.  We ordered everything up front (including dessert) but ended up waiting and waiting for the bread pudding after the meal.  We told her to cancel it and it ended up showing up right as we were leaving.  At this point we were already late so we each scarfed down a bite and ran out the door.  It also seemed more important to her to flirt with her fellow bartender than see if we needed anything.  We all wanted another round of drinks but could not get her attention.  By the time she noticed, we were done with our meal and it was a little late for another round.  Is it customary for bartenders to take away your glass when you still have at least two drinks left?  I felt like I still had a good amount of beverage left when the bartender tried to take away my glass.  Maybe it was our fault for catching a show after dinner but we thought an hour and a half would be sufficient.  Guess not.",

Not only that- but the service was incredible. Was a bit disappointed that they ran out of the shrimp, but what we did have was amazing. I'm pescatarian  and had the trout, beet salad, green beans and blue cheese and pear flatbread and it was all amazing. The skin on the trout was so crispy and the center cooked perfectly. I am super picky about fish as well. My husband loved his mooing burger and the chicken skins. People with us ordered medium burgers and the first time they came out extremely rare. We sent them back and had 3 different staff members come up and apologize. When the burgers came out again - in my opinion they were cooked perfectly medium but they still thought they were rare and 1 went back. Again the staff came and apologized and took both burgers off the check and gave us 3 free desserts. The banoffee pie was delicious! They went above and beyond despite me thinking the girl with us should have ordered her burger med-well. It was not the restaurants fault. By far the best meal I have had in Vegas. The service was great without being over the top. Will definitely go back next time I am in town.",

The only reason Carson's doesn't get 5 stars from me is because ALL of our food came out at different times, including my friend's a la carte veggies she ordered with her fish.  The server told us that everything comes comes out when ready and we should plan to share as it does.  I thought this odd but by then we were committed. It was her cauliflower, her fish, her husband's sandwich and some time later my turkey burger. I watched them eat most of their food and then they got to watch me eat mine (we did share some, but we wanted what we wanted).  So, I don't know if this is the general practice there or we just look like a bunch of schmucks but Carson's, your kitchen really ought to figure out how to time it so food is ready together.  Every other restaurant and home kitchens can do it, so can you.  Seriously.",

I must applaud the effort cause downtown its come long long way!!! Especially Fremont street with the experience but more with all bars at one end and then all these small restaurant. To be clear Carson Kitchen not located on Fremont but Carson Street is literally minutes off it. Like anything downtown parking not the most ideal situation but have all the hotels that can park at or street parking. Carson Kitchen the best idea is the Fremont Experience parking garage literally right there or Downtown Grand just accross the street.   I was pretty psyched about checking out Carson Kitchen for the first time. The best part was my cousin visiting with her family from the 808. She an avid yelper so I knew it was ONNN came first timers. It was for all of us. Talk about the BENEFITS of party of six or more. The only time take reservation if you have party of six or more. I went with my brother family my two nieces, my cousin her family niece and nephew, and then there me. So talk about spread of food. We pretty much ordered every appetizer on the menu. Literally had the Bacon Jam, Devils Eggs, Crispy Chicken Skins, Gyro Tacos, Meatballs, Scallops, some kind of popcorn shrimp, and Thai BBQ Pizza.    Bacon Jam was my favorite appetizer! The bacon jam talk about divine spread that was not only fabulous on the grilled believe baguette sliced bread. The charcoal mark the crispy bread then nice spread of not only bacon (the nice part you could see pieces of bacon rather then I all grounded or cooked out puree), caramelized onions, and nice sweetness like any jam. Devine. Definitely you can taste the hint of bacon grease in the jam also! It perfect for the kids. Or on this night my nieces and nephews was enjoying the bread by itself.   The Crispy Chicken Skin was the second winnah for me. It tastes like fried pork grinds chips you see in bags. I know not PORK but the texture similar and something that think of if never had crispy chicken skin. I loved it by itself. They have almost like sweet and sour dipping sauce that comes with it. I like the whole tiny fry basket for presentation. Truthfully came to presentation you can clearly see the Kerry Simon style. High end food. They incorporate unique severing dishes. The devil eggs presented on wine bottle cut in half.   The other appetizers it had no WoW factor in any of them. The Devils Eggs like any other Devils Egg. It looks great but only thing that makes it stand out is the caviar on top. It such small amount nothing rave about. The Gyro that was pretty solid. I think you get only two per order but since we had big party ordered two orders. So had four on one plate. The grilled dough they use as shells are nice crispy and hot. The filling very generous, the lamb real tasty cooking spot on, the tzatziki, cucumber, and tomato. All together makes for hearty taco! Just warning so much stuff that it drips with every bite!!! The Meatball by itself was ordinary but the sherry foie gras cream sauce now that was amazing. I could see that sauce on pasta dish would die for. The two together for me just never worked. The Scallops was seared to perfection just between the sauce and the starch nothing exciting. So much going on forgot the components where just blah. The pizza was ok but so many other good things pizza last thing need to try at Carson. My opinion.   I ordered the Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto. I really enjoyed. It not very often you see Black Rice on any menu. The combination of Oxtail Risotto sounded too good not to pass up. It had interest contrast with different texture rices. Oxtail made it nice and hearty. I think my brother had perfect analogy almost like hearty jook. The rice is not going be al dente since two different types. No doubt perfect dish on cold Vegas day and pretty filling dish. My cousins dishes looked pretty good. I had no room after all the apps tried more food.   The service was spot on fabulous. The whole staff on on it from the minute we sat down. I found great is when you get the bill they give you book. I know right like \"What the Hell??\". Guess you can sign it if you want. All the kids signed it. I thought that was cool.   The interior is very modern with community tables and upstairs outdoor patio area.   No doubt Carson Kitchen place highly recommend if looking for place eat downtown.",

I recommend going with a small group and ordering family style. That way everyone can try a bit of everything. Since the restaurant is small, you may have to wait a little for a table, however, there is a nice patio out back. I recommend grabbing a cocktail from the bar and relaxing back there until your table is ready. If you are lucky and it's chilly outside you can sit by the fire pit and get toasty.",

We were sat overlooking the kitchen in hightop's that were very comfy and I immediately loved everything because watching the magic happen is always a good thing in my book. The chefs were hot so that helps too. Nothing like tatted men who know how to cook!   The food was really good. Started with the devil eggs that were creamy and salty from the caviar & pancetta. Next came the sizzling bacon jam with Brie which was so sweet that I had to keep drinking my water. The finale was the butter burger and anything with the word \"butter\" in it can't go wrong. This burger is very simple with traditional toppings but tasted amazing. On the side came spicy tots that were the perfect amount of hot. All in all the food was great and we wanted to try everything on the menu so with that said we can't wait to go back.   The atmosphere is very casual with a very cool vibe. The staff is very friendly and we loved all the interesting people around us who made the experience.   If you're not a downtown person you are missing out big time! You can't get moments like this on the strip. Can't wait to go back!",

I wish that there is more cheese and more bread. Crispy chicken skin - excellent.  Great with the honey dipping.   Devil's egg - average.  We order it because a lot of yelper recommended it but it's just like other devil's egg.  Maybe I was expecting too much. NY Strip - excellent.  Meat is soft.  Very juicy.  Very tasty. Ancient grain greek (salad) - Good. Black rice & ox tail Risotto - Good.  But the taste is very subtle.  I wish for a stronger taste. Mac-Cheese - Good, but it's too expensive for what it is. Pear & Bleu flatbread - love it.    If I visit Carson Kitchen again, I will get chicken skin, NY strip, flatbread and a different salad.",

After being bookmarked and finding myself downtown with my family, I suggested this place.  We arrived on a Friday at 5 PM and the place was relatively empty. The joint is small. Maybe 30-40 people can dine here at most. Several 4 tops and two large bar-ish tables. They're neat the bar, high top, and large parties or 3 pairs of dining couples are seated here.  On to the important stuff. The food!  Bacon Jam is the jam! A sweet, tangy, and mildly spicy BBQ bacon jam is delivered to your table, bubbling, and topped with Brie. It's served with crunchy garlicky grilled bread. If you order one thing here... MAKE IT THIS!  Jalapeno Poppers were meh. It is what it is. Not bad, not memorable.   Pork Osso Buco. Succulent, flavor-able, fall of the bone tender. We ate this dish is two seconds. It was mouth sex.  MUST ORDER!  Broccoli Crunch: a light, fresh, crunchy, slightly sweet dish. The craisins and sunflower seeds kick this up a notch. A great side dish.  Pork Belly Carbonara was pretty bland as well. My mother thought the fried egg on top was cheese and got yolk everywhere.  That's what is memorable about this dish.  Gyro Tacos were flavorful and complex. They were just a bit dry. Tasty, but needing wetness.  Donought Bread Pudding was amazing. The donuts come from their neighbor O Face Donuts! Love learning about these little slices of community happening in Vegas (cause it's RARE - like Violet Eyes).  Carson Kitchen delivers. It's hit or miss and the offerings seem to change. It's hard to find as there isn't a street sign so GPS!!! Parking is on the street or in one of the nearby garages. I can't wait to go back!",

We then ordered the buffalo chicken flat bread which we watched them make right in front of us since we sat at the bar. The chicken was soo good the flat bread was nice and crispy with a good crunch. My boyfriend ordered the Sunday Secret Chicken I think. It was a burger with a good hunk of crispy chicken. The spicy tater tots they serve with it was like amazing.  I was craving for some desert and ordered the Donut Bread Pudding, and my goodness was that heaven in your mouth. They get the donut from the donut place next door. PLEASE PLEASE get the donut bread pudding its soo good.   Only my 2nd visit to Carson Kitchen, I will always come back. They have really good food and the location is just in Downtown.

    "text": "I wanted to like this place based off of their menu but their seating arrangements and lack of hospitality was thoroughly disappointing.  Tonight a friend of mine suggested we eat here, I've never been.  We arrive and spoke with the hostess.  She tells us for a table of 3 it'll be a 30 minute wait so we went and grabbed a drink at the bar.  As we drank we reviewed the menu.  I hadn't eaten all day and was starving so I've already pre selected several dishes I wanted to try myself.  I had about two appetizers 2 entries and few sides that I wanted to try, plus wine (which I was already having a glass of)  just on my own accord not counting my friend and the rest of our party.  After about 30 minutes or so, the hostess comes back and asks us when the rest of our party would arrive, we said in a few minutes they're running late.  She says \"if your party isn't here we cannot seat you, because we have a full house.\"  Even though 1. That disclaimer was not mentioned during the initial waiting period, and 2. Our party was legitimately running late.  Mind you I suggested that since our party is running late.  I will order for 4 so we'd make it worth their time.  When clearly myself alone was already tentatively at over $150 dollar bill.  I understand turning tables quickly, I also understand milking a cash cow as is.  If Ive already suggested ordering for four which means we would've cleared a 200 dollar bill, and had my friend and I only had two in our party but ordered for 4 it's a win win.  They've gotten their money and we would've gotten our food, and as soon as the rest of my party arrived the bill would've doubled, because like myself my friends and I are food fanatics.  The hostess was completely unapologetic for her lack of the disclaimer which still annoys me.  Had she mentioned the fact that our entire party needed to be present obviously we would've coordinated better and had everybody present and not have wasted an entire 30-40 MINUTES, waiting for a BS excuse at the END of our wait time!  It was a bullshit move and I took my money somewhere else.  Despite what looked like an appetizing menu, I won't come back to a place that refuses to serve people because they can't get their seating figured out.",

Note: They serve \"family style\" so all the dishes are served as they are finished and designed to share. We started with the deviled eggs, which came topped with bacon and eggs (caviar). Super tasty. We also go the pear salad, it was fresh and well proportioned. The pork chop was the star. It had this amazing apple puree and plum chutney. It was cooked to perfection. Dessert was the show stopper. Like, the fat lady was singing, game over. A doughnut made into bread pudding. It was better than it sounds, and it sounds so good I'm drooling as I'm typing.  This joint is hip, trendy, and just a short walk from Fremont street. Go there.",

Interestingly they seated us at the other half of the table that another party of 3 was using. It was super chill. This place has a very laid back vibe, I'm assuming they always sit people at tables communally because there weren't a lot of tables but they are pretty long. It's kind of upscale and dress is very casual. The food is a bit pricey, but it's family style, so you can share everything. I didn't think the flatbread with bacon jam and cheese was that good. I would've preferred more cheese to be available. The beers are NOT ON TAP. You will receive a can and a glass, so expect some cool hip beers, but not poured from a tap. Still great vibe, I think they also have a patio. They had an indian fusion flatbread (looks like a pizza). The flavor was too light for my preference. The steak was GREAT! paid parking lot across the street and some limited street parking.",

I could use adjectives like 'wonderful' and 'amazing', but these do not describe how awesome the food is. I've tried several dishes that I would normally shy away from, but every single one has been fantastic.    My last visit (March 2018) we sat at the bar in front of the chefs and right next to the pickup area for the waiters. Everyone was attentive and truly concerned about the overall experience. They gave us recommendations on food and drinks, all of which were good. We spent the entire night talking with Ethan and learning the history behind the restaurant. Places like this and restauranteurs like Cory are why \"eating out\" is not just a meal but experiences and memories I cherish.   Can't wait for the expansion to Atlanta! A two hour flight from Miami means I can enjoy this more often.",

When I asked for a second helping of it (because it was so good), I confirmed that once again it was vegan.  Tipped her well, everything was fine. The next day I find out it wasn't vegan. I wrote a very normal, not even 1 star review stating that although this place is a downtown favorite, I was served non-vegan food when I asked if it was vegan.  Owner messaged me and went on a complete psychopathic tirade. All his servers did was mess up - I was a server downtown before and I understand people aren't perfect. He was fixated on that I knew one of the servers who happened to have a sister who shared the physical description of her - or something. I'm still not quite entirely sure. It sounds like his server said we all knew her and were \"out to get her\", to save her skin when she messed up.  He posted a comment below, saying we went on Saturday (we went on Friday), we didn't tip well (I have my receipt), and that we were being rude to the servers we don't know, and that we were lying. I told him to please feel free to look at security cameras.   He has now mentioned our names in public, threatened to sue me and reach out to my place of work, stalked my Yelp reviews for reviews I made with friends who had eaten dishes or when I was not previously vegan. In a long string of private messages, he has accused me or so many things. It's rather bizarre, and WTF-worthy. Dude, your servers just messed up. Should've apologized nicely, asked me to take it down. call it a day. Would've been very disappointing for someone with severe dairy allergies or someone who had been vegan for much longer than I have to have to go through with this.  I also know I'm not the only person who has received strange and terrible customer service here. :)",

We were seated at the bar in front of the appetizer prep station. Staff were all really friendly and attentive to our needs. The style of serving is more of a social, sharing type experience, which we loved but may not be for everyone.   Bacon Jam = life changer. Get it. You won't regret it. Steak was amazing as well.

    "text": "A friend and colleague brought me here for dinner when we were in Vegas fro NAB.  He preps me by telling me this is one of his favorite, chill places in the Fremont District...the food and drinks are great, but that we can expect to wait for a while.  As promised, we walk in and the super-friendly hostess tells us there's about an hour wait, and then invites us to grab a drink from the bar and chill in their outdoor patio.  We opt to walk down the street and grab a drink at another hip spot, so we put our name on the list.  When we get back, there's some lady going absolutely nuclear on the staff at the front door.  She's screaming so loud, she's just about frothing at the mouth and no one can really tell what she's pissed off about.  What was remarkable was that the manager and the hostess were so kind and patient with her...and even though they were trying to settle her down, she still stormed out yelling about how she'll never set foot in there again (Thank God! lol!).  The manager seats us at the counter in front of their huge, beautiful open kitchen (at our request), and apologize profusely for the scene.  He then calls out to the chef to serve us some tasters and small plates from the kitchen, on the house, by way of apology.  We explain that's not necessary...but he insists (super classy!!).    We then order a couple of first-rate drinks from the bar and spend the next two and a half hours on a delicious journey of culinary greatness!!  Seriously, one of the best, most fun meals I've had in a long time.  Once she realized how into the experience we are, the chef keeps dropping us tasty morsels to try...deep friend chicken skins that were perfectly crispy, salty, oily yumminess...cauliflower bites that were at the same time light and healthy & rich and sinful (how do you do that?!?  Seriously).  Plate after plate of mind blown, tongue tickling satisfaction!!  So yeah...Carson Kitchen gets one of my highest recommendations!!  When you come, expect three things...food that will amaze and surprise, perfect drinks, and a staff that will treat you like instant friends!!  Just know that there's going to be a wait.  And treat the staff kindly.  Don't be that lady...ever.  Just don't!!",

    "text": "Party of 2 adults and 1 child, came on a Friday afternoon. We were seated promptly. Only about half crowded downstairs and upstairs patio was closed.   If I could give 2.5 stars overall I would. Service was ok. Food was ok. Nothing new or interesting.   Server asked if we wanted all the food items to come out as they are ready or altogether. We requested the deviled eggs as an appetizer first and everything else to come together afterwards. We got the deviled eggs first and quickly, but then my husband got his sandwich and probably 12-15 min later I got my burger (was sharing with my toddler since there's no kids menu). He really had to dawdle to keep from eating his whole sandwich while me and my son waited for our burger.   Deviled eggs were good and I would order again.  Then burger came and cheese wasn't melted, not even a tiny bit. If I had known that cold cheese was going to come on it I wouldn't have ordered it. Burger was just ok. Nothing great, In-N-Out makes a more flavorful burger.  My husband liked his chicken sandwich. He just wishes he didn't have to dawdle while eating it. Since two hungry people sat staring across from him. Tater tots were good but nothing special. Mac n cheese was very good, smooth, perfect amount of bite. Portions were good.   I really don't get the \"mind blowing\" reviews. Maybe it's because we live in San Diego and this menu has been done long ago. The atmosphere is decent, nothing outstanding. Very clean. The bill coming in a book is nothing special it was a trend years ago in California. If you're hungry and in the area go ahead and eat here. But don't go out of your way to come here on a weekday. Save your time and dine elsewhere IMO.",

For mains, flatbread mushroom was highly recommended but it was ok compared to the butter burger or the pork sirloins. But these, inspite of being so good, fell flat infront of the Blackened catfish. The service was super quick as well. One of the best places I've been to!!!!",

    "text": "The menu sounded amazing. Lots of interesting American food that is trendy and very friendly service.  Lots of things are spicy on the menu and not all are labelled as such. I really like spicy but my mom is a wimp so that put a hitch in the bacon jam. It was yummy for sure and very rich with all that bacon but spicy so she couldn't eat it. The description had nothing about that.  The beet salad was really yummy! Goat cheese, pistachios, golden wand red beets. Yum!  We also got the friend green tomatoes with lump crab. It just didn't have a lot of flavour and had a ton of breading.  Our server, although very efficient and sweet wasn't the most helpful with the cocktail menu. I wanted something strong and not too sweet and Towns End with whiskey and a sweet liquor was really not what I was looking for. The honey bee one sounded amazing. I should have stuck with my first thought.  It's nice that it's away from all the traffic and healthy option exist but I wouldn't rush back",

(We loved the larger tables allowing conversation with people we didn't know; great vibe.)  Stacie waited on us and was AWESOME.  I requested an old fashioned with Bullit, which was FABULOUS; bartender NAILED it.    On to the food.  Deviled eggs with pancetta and caviar?  EXCELLENT.  Killer Shrimp?  SUPERB way to describe the sauce and crunch!  Veal meatballs with a sherry fois gras cream?  AMAZING!  suzanne asked us to try the bacon jam, and we regretted not ordering one!  This place ROCKS tapas!  We finished with a TOGO order of the glazed donut bread pudding, which was DECADENT and still warm when we got back to the Bellagio.  Overall bill?  Less than $100!!  In any other restaurant on the strip, this would have been 3 times that!!  We WILL plan to try one of the other restaurants they are opening.  Clearly the management and staff are part of a new \"food revolution\".  We're with you!  THANK YOU!!",

    "text": "The Strip has its big name restaurants, but I feel the REAL culinary talent and passion is on Downtown Las Vegas.  We dined at Carson Kitchen for lunch this past Saturday. It is in a great spot because it is about 3 blocks from the Golden Nugget where we were staying. Although, in 104 degree heat, 3 blocks feel like three miles. Also, there is a ridiculous amount of construction going on in the neighbored so it makes the hike to Carson Kitchen a little more interesting.   Carson Kitchen sits on a rather obscure corner on roughly 6th and Carson. Next door to Donut Bar. There is no sign on the side of the building. No flashing lights or showgirl pointing the way. Just large windows with smoked glass etched with Carson Kitchen on them. When you walk in, you first notice how small the place actually is. The dining room is attached to the open kitchen and the bar area sits off by itself on the other end of the dining room. The decor is very industrial with some communal tables and counter seating.  The menu at Carson Kitchen is very simple in my view. Jason, our server, helped us make some choices. We chose items from the Social Plates and Farm & Garden parts of the menu. We started out with the Devil's Eggs. They were deviled eggs topped with crispy pancetta and caviar. When you bite into them, you get the salty burst of flavor from the caviar and the crispy texture from the pancetta. Next we had the pork belly with buffalo bleu beurre blanc. The pork belly was perfectly cooked and the beurre blanc gave it a little kick. We then had the Fried Green Tomatoes topped with lump crab ravigote(almost like a Cole slaw, but with finely shredded crab meat.) We ended our meal with the veal meatballs topped with a sherry foie gras cream. Talk about rich! However, the best dish was the Fried Green Tomatoes.   Carson Kitchen also has a good craft cocktail menu. I opted to try the Pretty Rye for the Chi Guy. It is made up of George Dickel Rye, orgeat syrup, velvet falernum, fresh lime, mint. It was refreshing and very smooth drink. You could easily drink several of them and not feel anything until you tried to walk away.  Next time you are in Las Vegas, get off the strip and head downtown to where the real culinary passion is in Vegas. You won't be disappointed.",

But... when you find perfection, it's hard to switch it up.  MUST HAVE- Fried chicken skin. Oh my goodness these are heavenly. They come with a honey dipping sauce. The dish is frustrating, but keeps you from over saucing, if that's even a thing.  Deviled eggs... again, PERFECTION!!! Bacon jam is delicious with the brie cheese. Mmmm   And we get the Butter burger... oh my. Juicy, and PACKED with flavor with a side of tots. I recommend asking for the spicy pickle sauce to dip the tots.   The ONLY thing I dont like about this place is sitting at the bar, both my knees have bruises. There isnt any leg room and you're forced to smash your knees, which also sucked for my husband because he is an amputee.   Definitely recommend this place.",

    "text": "I have been to Carson Kitchen several times. Five of us gathered to share plates and taste the items on the new summer menu--a menu composed of the most ordered items at Carson Kitchen during its five years.  The restaurant recently marked its 5th year in business.  Items shared:  Crispy chicken skins and smoked honey Wok charred edamame with ginger salt, togarashi Fried green tomatoes with lump crab ravigote Watermelon and feta with cucumber, white balsamic Blackened catfish with spring pea slaw Green, eggs, & ham flatbread with pistou, smoked mozz, tasso Broccoli crunch with green goddess, sunflower & pumpkin seeds Young beets with pistachio, red & green grape, goat cheese Wild mushroom flatbread with caramelized onion, bleu cheese Wild boar sloppy Joe with crispy fennel, orange aioli Chicken thighs with Alabama white barbecue Pork tenderloin with jalapeno pesto Glazed doughnut bread pudding with three rum caramel, vanilla creme anglaise Bourbon fudge brownie with brown butter bacon ice cream and candied bacon Peach upside down cake with crafthaus zitrone, whipped mascarpone  There was not one item I would hesitate to get again.  Outstanding items for me were the catfish, beets, wild mushroom flatbread, chicken thighs, and the pork tenderloin.  Consider all the desserts to be your friend.  They are very, very good!  The fried catfish has a bit of zing on the breading.  The pork tenderloin with jalapeno pesto surprised some of our group--the pesto is hot and it is fantastic alone or with the pork loin.  If you're a fan of bleu cheese, get the wild mushroom flatbread.  The cheese is bleu cheese and it's rich and very tasteful!  While these dishes are not new to Carson Kitchen, several of them were new to me but I intend to go back and have some more pork loin with the jalapeno pesto.    Chef Harwell and his staff continue to do excellent dishes.  Thanks to him and Matt for explaining the dishes.  I'll be back and back.",

    "text": "There is no denying Downtown Las Vegas has developed tremendously over the past five years, from East Fremont to The Arts District, and although competition is now tougher than ever Carson Kitchen continues to pack the house from open to close as a result of good Food, delicious Drinks, great service and fair prices.  Nothing less than iconic entering its sixth year, a milestone reached by less than a quarter of Restaurants nationwide (and likely far less in Sin City,) it was impromptu that four guests stopped in at 7:30pm, greetings at the hostess podium yielding unclaimed seats near the window where a young man named Roman offered excellent recommendations as well as descriptions for guests who jokingly claimed to be first-timers.  Obviously far from the truth in terms of patronage, this visit actually number seventeen including every menu since Summer of 2015, it was after listening to stories of \"founders\" Cory Harwell and Kerry Simon that four Cocktails arrived, Matthew Harwell's creativity continuing to impress from Sangria to Tricky Vic and Get Shorty!, though much like day one The Magarian remains unsurpassed thanks to an herbaceous top-note lifted by restrained sweetness and effervescence.  Ordering a la carte from Carson Kitchen's current \"Greatest Hits\" menu, a celebration of the Restaurant's past as well as the upcoming expansion, it was opting for dishes not tasted in some time that \"Devil's Eggs\" arrived quickly, the request from a woman who \"never thought I'd like Caviar\" attesting to Cory's longtime goal of making esoteric Ingredients accessible to those who may not have previously known any better.  Next up, Fried Green Tomatoes, a dish concocted by Georgia-born Harwell and carefully prepared by Chef Scott Simon, it was beneath tangy Crab Meat that all three rounds delighted guests before transitioning to \"Gyro Tacos\" and charred Edamame that both also shine thanks to complex spices and a touch of acid.  Continuing with Tempura-battered Green Beans, the more-sweet-than-spicy Cream Cheese another southern staple, it was after hearing a story about a former Chef nixing \"Killer Shrimp\" that the dish was revisited after sixteen months, its textural comparison to Chinese Walnut Prawns undeniable though the use of Peruvian Peppers give each bite subtle yet sustaining fire.  Revisiting Oxtail Risotto for the first time in three years, and vowing to never go so long again after one bite of creamy Rice and Cheese, it was \"Between Bread\" that entrees were offered, the Secret Sunday Chicken recently featured on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbestofvegas.com&s=d0c663c6dccfc82d56d402c808dc14b51d910e547b519f9b0ba2667df8d9fecf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bestofvegas.com</a> predictably outstanding while the Butter Burger cooked medium-rare and Wild Boar Sloppy Joe are both crafted with an eye on balance in terms of taste as well as texture.  A bit overwhelmed by three cones of Tots, a doggy bag trip to the oven doing little to dampen their crunchy appeal, it was with Iced Tea in hand and The National playing overhead that Dessert was ordered, Peach Cake with Mascarpone proving super for summer while Donut Bread Pudding bathed in Rum and Bourbon Brownies with housemade Brown Butter Bacon Ice Cream remain every bit the delight they were when first debuted 61 months prior.",

All the flavors went amazingly well together and even tho by itself the burger woulda been a tad spicy, the mango chutney slaw balanced that perfectly. Top it off woththose crispy tater tots - YESSS!   *I came back here the other day with a friend and we ordered the bacon jam as an app - HOLYYYY SHIT!!! I don't even care that it burned the top of my mouth, it was unbelievably good! MUST TRY.",

We saw a family with young kids, I didn't expect that but it seemed to have perfectly fine.   Service was great, servers where all super nice, helpful, didn't get annoyed by my 200 questions and good came out fast too.   The Mac and cheese was great Flat bread was just ok  I personally loved the beet salad a lot  Only one complaint I have is that I wished there was some healthier food options for vegetarians.  Maybe less greasy food (that's just me)",

They were delicious and seasoning was Indescribable. We also had two different salads which were so good. For the main courses we had the steak, catfish, and butter burger. Everything was seasoned to perfection and the rub on the steak was to die for. Of course we split a dessert which was the glazed donut pudding, again it was scrumptious. We drank as well, one of the stand out drinks was \"Get Shorty\".  I would be remiss if I didn't talk about our waiter Geronimo, he was witty, extremely familiar with the menu, and overall delivered Impeccable service. I would absolutely go back to this restaurant. Probably one of the best I've went to in Vegas.",

The service was fantastic and Ethan was a great host and filled us in on the restaurant history and about the cuisine. The wait was somewhat long; however, WELL worth it. There is a small bar to grab a cocktail while you wait and an outdoor area.  My girlfriend and I felt this dining experience was the highlight of our Vegas weekend. Can't say enough. We will be back and highly recommend to our friends and anyone wanting fantastic food and a neat dining experience.",

All of their food is served in small, sharable fashion so you can try a little of everything. We got the pork belly, bourbon brownie, and mac n cheese - all of which was AMAZING. I can't remember which beer we got (came in a bottle), but it was super tasty too!  Would highly recommend as a snack spot! Not sure I could afford to eat a full meal here (prices are high $10+/plate and a plate is not a typical meal size), but a very fun snack treat!",

We waited outside inside their cute patio.  Food : we got the gyro tacos, very filling, lot of meat and yummi flatbread , the brussel sprouts with bacon was also very yummi, very well seasoned , I think a little bit on the expensive side for being a side ( $8), the cauliflower  was way too salty , Ithe green tomatoes for me was a bust not much flavor,  I didn't think the tater tots were spicy, the steak with the cocoa sauce was good. Overall wasn't much impressed with food , I didn't  like the fact that we didn't get our foods together, and I'm not talking about 5 minutes but like 15 minutes between  each other .",

The menu is as unique as they come, from crispy chicken skin appetizers to rabbit ragu spaghetti, they have strayed far from all the downtown food niche and created one of their own.  With the soon-to-be-open upstairs bar and patio, hopefully their presence will be solitified in the Downtown Vegas scene.  I have great hopes for this place.

The wait was 45 minutes. We got there in time and after another 10 minutes we were seated by Im guessing the manager who sat us at the bar. I said we were waiting for a table and he looked at me like I was crazy and said, \"well what do you want? If you want a table we only have two tables for two and the wait is 90 minutes.\" He was kind of exasperated with me even thinking we'd get a table.  He was (my perception) very abrasive. We were hungry so we sat at the bar which was so loud I couldn't hear my boyfriend unless we were shouting. Music was loud the bar was crowded. And he sat us right near the register when all bar seats were empty and people were bumping my boyfriend and the noise! But after being treated like a child the first time i asked a question we went along. After 5 minutes we gave our apologies to the very nice female bartender and left. Just be sure to ask for a TABLE, if you want a nice relaxing dinner. We headed to the aptly called restaurant Therapy which I felt I needed.",

    "text": "What a crap show. I live in downtown Las Vegas so i have eaten here a few times. The food is decent, but the service is dicey at best. But this last time will be my last time. We were a party of 4 told wait 40 minutes. An hour passes still no table. While we are waiting outside on a colder than expected Veags night. Several groups have come in after us and been seated. Finally they say we can sit at the bar in two groups of two, away from each other. If we wait another 15 minutes. Hostess says this with a straight face. Yeah no thanks.  We went to one of the many other great restaurants within walking distance (le thai, therepy, perch to name a few). The food here is not worth the attitude of the staff. Take it from a local do yourself a favor walk a few feet and go somewhere else.",

I had the NY Strip Steak, great sear, great flavor, good cut, Fingerling potatoes were really good too.  The only things I wasn't too fond of was the Old Fashioned they made (waaaaaay too much club soda) and felt they were understaffed. Other than that, everything was great and would really recommend it and will definitely come back.",

I got a $12 Mac and Cheese, which was too rich in flavor and so tiny. The dishes were pretty interesting and had unique ingredients in it which I can see WHY they may be more expensive but it was just not worth it.   The restaurant was pretty tiny, the seats were high and had no backing. The atmosphere just seemed really \"cool\", but the place is all hype. It's a great place to go if you want to show off a date during dinner time and be really trendy, but otherwise I wouldn't suggest it. I left hungry and poor.",

    "text": "All I can say is WOW! If I could give Caron Kitchen 6 out of 5 stars I would! Five star service and food at a truly affordable ($$) establishment. My boyfriend and I found this hidden gem on yelp and they had me at brownies with bourbon bacon ice cream and fresh herbs like Rosemary and sage served as garnish in the cocktails.  We came for dinner on a Monday night and did have to wait about 30 minutes (because this is a small restaurant with limited seating) but the wait was worth it. We sat at the bar that faces all the action in the kitchen and got to see everything first hand. Not only was I impressed with the food, I was impressed with how personable the wait staff (we were served by Dakota) and GM (Matt) were. We shared the tempura green beans, bison burger sliders, and Mac n cheese, which were all mouth wasteringly amazing. We didn't have room for dessert so we came back the next night and splurged by having all three. The bacon bourbon ice cream was delicious as promised and I also LOVED the donut bread pudding with caramel sauce. I mean really!! So so so good.  My advice - go twice and try as many items as possible. The cocktails are fantastic too. Well done Caron Kitchen! We will be back!!!",

We ordered one of the \"social plates\" the chicken skins which come with honey.  It was ok but I wouldn't order it again.  Family member wanted something else to dip it in and was told no.  Ordered the Rainbow Cauliflower which is the worst dish I've had in a long time.  The flavor was so caustic, I almost couldn't breath.  Fortunately the Baked Mac and Cheese arrived and it was delicious.  Finally, I ordered the Butter Burger and tater tots which was very well cooked and was very impressive.  I was surprised how much I liked the tots.   Cooked to perfection, I highly recommend them.  ---There are so many great restaurants in town I wouldn't make a special trip to go here.  If you do, get a table, don't sit at the bar, service wasn't that great.",

We were lucky enough to sit at the counter just across from Chef John Courtney. The food was superb. I couldn't decide what to order and walked away full. The highlight really was the chef. As if he did not have enough to do in the kitchen- He kept an eye out as to what was going on in the dining space. Then on the way out he took a few minutes to ask how we enjoyed lunch. I will definitely be back on my next trip",

The waiters are very \"hipster\", but the service was excellent and they were very accommodating to our party of 8 without a reservation. Great beer list and the food is excellent. Definitely go in with a tapas style mindset and try a bit of everything. We tried the Crispy Chicken Skins (addicting), Bacon Jam (order this. immediately.), Gyro Tacos, and the Veal Meatballs (order this as well. immediately.). I also had the Bone-in Pork Belly. It was as ridiculously awesome as it sounds. Think of it as a bacon steak. I would definitely come back here.",

My Boyfriend found this restaurant and we trust him on his choices usually and we were right!  This place doesn't take reservations but would put you on waiting list. We got there around 7:30 and we waited maybe 15 mins outside with fire pit to keep warm.  We took some pictures also which was nice. Let me tell you... This place is a must try if you eve go to Vegas, esp if you are with a big group of friends.... Just so you can order a plate of each and try everything! I highly recommend the crispy chicken skin served with HOT honey! It was a taste of heaven and great to share with 4 or 5 people so you won't get fat! The veal meatball with foie gras cream was delicious also.  We had try almost every dish on the menu being that we have 6 in our group! If you are looking for something healthy or healthier, the roasted beet with goat cheese is the dish to try! Anyway, everything comes in small portions and like I said, go in a group and you can try everything! The most important thing is , the bill came out surprisingly cheap... We even ordered 2 bottles of red with our delicious savory dinner. Go Go Go Go Go Go Go!!!!!!! Just Go!",

At any rate once we found it the reception was excellent. It was a rainy evening so the upper patio was unavailable. We were seated at the bar where we could see the kitchen and the orders coming out so we had an opportunity to see the various dishes while we had a drink or two. Our waitress was excellent and the manager who was checking out the dishes was very nice. As we asked what things were he would tell us.  We started with a couple of appetizers. The spicy shrimp was tasty and the gyro tacos were very good. We then had some Mac and cheese, Cuban pork belly sandwich, and some pan seared chicken thighs. It should be noted that the tots that came with the Cuban are extraordinary. My girlfriend is a self avowed tot expert and she gave them a thumbs up.  The best thing about our experience was that the Sou chef was willing to share the recipes and ingredients with us. The other chefs chimed in to make it an intimate experience.   I highly recommend this establishment   Thank you to the entire staff for making it a great experience.",

So best to go with a group to be able to sample a bunch of things.  Cauliflower is great, gyro tacos are good, mac n cheese is really good, chicken skins are decent, devil's eggs with caviar are yummy too.  I have never had anything bad here.    Definitely suggest going with a group of around 4 and order different things so you can try a bunch!  Have many more than that, I would imagine it would be tough to get a seat quickly because they are always packed.",

We sat on stools facing the cooks, so we were able to watch all the prep.  The thing I was struck by the most was how well the staff gets along.  They seemed happy to be doing their jobs and the affection they had for one another was clearly evident.  The food is phenomenal.  We ordered the Chicken skins, asparagus salad, butter burger and pizza (ham and pineapple).  Everything was delicious.  The chicken skins are very popular, and although I like crispy skin, they were a bit much for me.  The idea of eating all that skin kind of got in my head a little,  but my husband loved them.  We had the bourbon brownie and bacon ice cream for dessert.  It was so rich and delicious.  I highly recommend Carson Kitchen.  We will make this a must stop during all our trips to Vegas!  (p.s. this restaurant is in the old part near Fremont Street.  It is wedged in the middle of an old building - facing the street.  There is on street parking, but be ready to put some money in the kiosk.  Nothing is free in Vegas anymore!)",

The inside is small but fun, and has a good atmosphere. It's loud and lively. Seems like a fun downtown place. Had I known about the patio when I made the reservations, we would have definitely been up there! So fun!  The waiter was great - friendly and attentive, but not too much.   For food, plates are smaller- like tapas style, and they make for a great date/small party. They \"suggest\" that you share, but it's basically forced sharing as everyone's food comes out at different times. We had a large group and the first persons dish to the last was nearly 25 minutes. Sharing ended up being fine but if you're not a sharer or are with people you don't really want digging into your food, maybe go elsewhere that night. It's a little pricey for the small portions, but that's the \"in\" thing.  We ordered: Pork Osso Buco - Definitely tender... fall of the bone but it was lacking flavor. I'd skip it.  Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto - My husband ordered this and ate every last bite, so I'd say it was good.  Chicken Skins - These are spicy! Spicy enough I couldn't eat them. The sauce is interesting too. Good if you like liquid smoke.  Mac and Cheese - Was good! Gyro Tacos - I'd probably order only this if we ever go back.   The drinks were great - I got sangria and it was like juice. I think I knocked back 3 before I told the waiter no more!  It's kid friendly, but be aware that they don't have high chairs.  Definitely fun for drinks/apps. Treat it like that instead of a restaurant. and Sit outside!",

Very unique food with a twist, the black rice looks strange, but the taste is very good.  The meatballs are very tasty and so was the short rib sliders.  I sure wasn't expecting that sweet taste which comes from the rootbeer sauce.  The only thing that bothers me is the parking as with any Downtown place you want to visit.  A definite must try!!!!",

Without expectation, I was contacted by the owner himself who offered my boyfriend and I to have a second chance at the restaurant. That made me feel good that he actually took the time out of his busy schedule to contact me and find out where had things gone wrong and how not only he, but also his staff could fix the issue.   My boyfriend and I had a re-do date night at Carson Kitchen last night and all was AMAZING. Our favorites dishes were: mac 'n cheese, killer shrimp, green beans with that yummy pepper jelly cream cheese, and the NY Strip which was full of flavor. It was worth the second chance and we will be back again. The dessert, Glazed Donut Bread Pudding was fabulous as well :)   Thank you staff at Carson Kitchen for everything last night. It was well worth it. :)",

To finish it off, there was the glazed doughnut bread pudding.  It was indescribable.  You just have to get it on your own, though I would warn it is a touch sweet.

    "text": "Let me gather my thoughts... It's difficult to paraphrase an explosive experience on a full stomach. Ok I'll start from beginning to end. We got there and parking was difficult, greeter at the door was nice, super packed, 45 minute wait, ordered a beer at the bar, waited in the back courtyard. Now this seems rather unpleasant, but this is where Carson Kitchen 'stepped their game up' and delivered. At the bar they had a Brooklyn Brown Ale that my friends and I enjoy and haven't seen here in the west coast. The court yard in the back was surprisingly serene, reminiscent of times spent in a backyard BBQ with friends. The wait was actually 15 mins which translated to 'freaking awesome' (I like the under-promising and over-delivering). Now, the fifth star was credited to the food and the man behind the magic. Bacon Jam is on point and that is no understatement because I found myself spreading that goodness on everything. No joke. I put it on the Mac n cheese, I put it on the gyro tacos, I put it on the coco steak. Don't get me wrong, all of these dishes lacked nothing and were incredible by themselves, but that bacon jam was like crack for me, and given the means I would've taken it intravenously. I guess one of the chefs came out to check on us and he couldn't have been a more 'cool like dat' kind of guy. Kudos to Eugene the chef, you made that food your bitch and owned it. Not quite sure who the owner is but you get the standing 'O' for nailing the whole ambiance of this place. You seriously got that five star taste without all that pretension of those snotty, over priced, mish-mash, upscale casino restaurants. Most def coming back here and referring it to my friends and family.",

The best dish was the \"Killer Shrimp\" and I also loved the Gyro Tacos.  The butter burger was perfect but, if you're going tapas style, plan to split it.  And the best part was a wonderful waitress, Allison.  She was a joy - friendly, attentive and fun!",

The staff had a great understanding of the menu and more than willing to share their opinion.  The food was delicious!  We shared several items including fried chicken skins, crab cheese fondue and tempura string beans.  All excellent.  For the main meal our group ordered beef stroganoff or the butter burger.  Again flavor and presentation were fantastic.  We had a great dining experience between the food, service and the sense of humor of the staff.",

I knew who Chef Kerry Simon was seeing him on the Food Network a couple times. I like his style of fun, american style food. The restaurant is very nice with an open kitchen. I thought it was a little tight inside with little elbow space between your dining companions. However, the food here is excellent. We tried the Chicken Skins with Smoked Honey Dip ($6), Mushroom and Mozarella Flatbread ($12), and Bison Sliders with Spicy Tatertots ($12). They all tasted great. The best thing at this restaurant was definitely the Bacon Jam with Brie and Baguette ($12). It was sweet, salty, sour goodness! That dish is definitely in my Top 5 of must try Vegas eats. If you're in downtown, I say forget the oxtail soup in California Hotel and come try the Bacon Jam. Keep calm and Kerry on!",

You can tell everyone is happy to be there, and it was such a fun experience to escape the Strip and eat high quality, creative food without having to pay a fortune. Their rootbeer glazed pork sliders were the best thing I've ever had. The duck confit flatbread with fig jam and Gorgonzola was fantastic. The beef Wellington empanadas were served with a red wine reduction and I absolutely loved them. We topped off the night with a bourbon brownie served with bacon butter cream Ice cream. We wanted to eat everything on the menu, and we know we will be back next time we are in town. As a tourist, it was nice to come to an actual foodie place, and then hop over to Fremont street to walk off all of the amazing comfort food. Plates are smaller- like tapas style, and they make for a great date/small party. My favorite part is that you will most likely be sitting a community table or a bar that faces the staff. This setup enhances the fun experience by forcing you to engage with everyone around you. We eat at a lot of fun places in Denver and Chicago, and I must say this has been one of the best experiences I've had in a long time. The best part- our bill was waaaaay lower than expected! They had such thoughtful touches, too- our bill was served in an old book!",

Luckily, there is some seating around a cozy fire pit out back where we enjoyed a Project Idaho and Simonsays Sangria. Both were excellent. We were finally seated, but I did not realize the bar area was part of dinner seating. Our bartender/waitress was awesome. Dining space a little tight at the bar, so I would probably request a table next time. We shared the bacon jam, gyro tacos, and the sea bass. The toasted baguettes were tearing up the roof of my mouth Cap'n Crunch-style, but the bacon jam was too good to stop! The tacos tasted Greek, but still felt like a taco (if that makes any sense). The sea bass was excellent--tender on the inside with a nice crust on top. My husband found a new favorite beer here: Maui Bikini Blonde. The food and drinks were excellent, and the atmosphere was great, too. Thank you for a great evening. We will definitely come back.",

    "text": "First of all, I love the location. It reminds me of East Coast eateries, small places with great ambience. I also liked that this place wasn't trying too hard to be anything. It was just a cozy spot.  We came in rather late, a little after 10 pm not realizing they actually close at 11pm. We got seated at the bar area, which was perfectly fine with us. We like sitting at the bar - and with an open kitchen, it gives us an insight about how our food is being prepared.  We ordered the Mac n Cheese, Bacon Jam and the Beef Wellington Empanada. The Mac N Cheese was well made seasoned with truffle oil. The flavor of the truffle oil was distinctive. Also the macaroni pasta was done al dente, which is how it's supposed to be served all the time. I also liked the Beef Wellington Empanada, specially the crust - not too flaky, but also not too thick either. The beef was tender and was flavorful. I didn't care so much about the red wine sauce but there wasn't so much of it that it really didn't bother me.  I wasn't too crazy about their bacon jam either. There was too much onion in it that you could hardly taste the bacon. They also seasoned it with a lot of apple cider (?) or some kind of vinegar. I could tell bec it was too tangy. There wasn't so much of a balance of the sweet, salty and savory flavor that I associate with bacon jam. It wasn't bad though, it just wasn't to my liking.  The staff was very nice and even if it was a few minutes to closing, we didn't feel like we were being rushed. Our server was very attentive and friendly. I would definitely keep this on my list of places to revisit.",

Highlights include their spaghetti carbonara that had pork belly and a tempura egg, beef stroganoff, turducken pot pie, bacon jam, really everything we've had there has been worth writing home about. Great hip downtown spot with an exciting vibe/energy that has a full bar and some nice beers on offer. They give you your tab in a book that you can write in to commemorate your visit. I'd say it's closer to three dollar signs because you'll want to try a variety of items when you get there. Best downtown spot for my money.",

They don't take reservations so we called ahead to put our name on the list, as the hostess recommended.  We were seated about 10 minutes after arrival on a Saturday night, so that was pretty good.  It was really too crowded to wait inside.  While waiting outside, a dude kept walking up and down the street crazily shouting profanities at nobody, so that added some color to that part of the evening.  Again, this is sort of to be expected in this part of town.    When we were seated, it was at the bar.  I wasn't expecting this but we thought it was fun.  If you are seated at the bar, be prepared for people ordering drinks over your head and handing over payments next to your food.  The bar tender was also our server, so there wasn't much discussion of the menu, just \"you guys want food?\".  He was very nice and good at his job, but between the noise level and him trying to make drinks for the entire restaurant, I didn't really feel able to ask any questions about the menu. (I did have some, but oh well)  On to the food......Awesome!!  I had the killer shrimp, which were nice and spicy along with the pork belly cuban.  I thought the cuban was a little heavy on the yellow mustard, along with the pickles giving it a sort of McDonald's Cheeseburger flavor profile.  But, it would have been the best McD's burger of my life....so there you go.  Also, it came with really good house made tater tots.  I probably wouldn't order this dish again, but I don't regret getting it.  It was nice and crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside.  Hubby got the strawberry manchego salad and the garlic fingerling potatoes (he's a vegetarian).  Both were really great.  It was a really nice meal and I really enjoyed my house berry sangria.  It wasn't the same old sangria with oranges and cheap fruit.  It was nice and bright tasting with fresh berries in the glass.  Hubs got some gin concoction with cucumber and thyme.  I thought it was awfully bitter, but that's right up his alley and he really loved it.    The food is definitely 5 star quality, but I knocked off a star just for the whole over crowded feel of the place and not having a real server.  For that price, it would be nice to have had a table and someone to talk to about the food before ordering.  Also, when you're waiting to be seated, they offer you the option of getting a drink at the bar while you wait..........except, the bar is actually table seating, so if you were to lean over people eating and shout a drink order, there is no where to actually enjoy said drink.  Kind of a turn off.    This place is worth the visit, just know what you're getting into before arrival.",

The food is ok, we ordered the Deviled Eggs, which had way too much onion, didn't say it in the menu but they were edible. We also had the killer shrimp, wasn't that spicy it was a baby kick. Tempura Green beans were a home run specially with the pepper jelly cream cheese! Another home run was the Watermelon and Feta amazing! That's an amazing combination didn't say onions in the menu but edible! Great experience, amazing service and cool music!",

They put so much love and effort into everything they make. At first, I was a little turned off by the seating. I felt like I was in the kitchen, but very quickly realized we had the best spot in the house.   I had 2 of their hand crafted cocktails, both we're on point! They had an excellent craft beer list (I work in the industry and that means something to me) my husband was only able to drink 1 beer, because we filled up on food.  I suggest the green beans and BBQ burned ends, those were my favorites. We ordered 5 items off the menu, nothing disappointed. I feel like you can't go wrong. Then there was dessert.... the bourbon brownie was amazing. Homemade ice cream was the best I've ever had!  At the end of our meal Micheal asked us how everything was? We told him how impressed we were and that we will make it a point to stop in every time we visit the city.",

My life experiences with Mac and cheese will only go downhill from here.     The bison sliders were equally as life-changing. The first bite dropped a vicious Hulk Hogan leg drop on my tastebuds. And the subsequent bites were just as flavorful and wonderful. These are a must order.     The third dish we got were the gyro tacos. And again, the flavor train came rolling through once more. I don't know who the conductor was, but the entire kitchen/wait staff do an exceptional job. This may be my favorite restaurant and it kills me I won't be able to have it again until I visit Vegas next time.     If in downtown, do not even consider eating anywhere else.

Tucked away  in DTLV near other new little hot spots around the Fremont area is this awesome little Resturant. Driving by you would know much of it but step inside and you will find yourself in a hip cool Resturant.   It's not that big but not that small either with a great bar and a cool little kitchen counter type thingy. Prior to coming here I've been doing my homework and had a list of items that I wanted to try but bringing that that would be almost their entire menu I had to pick and choose.   So here is what I went with  Their signature Bacon Jam- 3/5 good great concept but it wasn't my favorite or I won't rub tho back for it. You must try at least once for yourself to judge if you are crazy about it or not.  The deviled eggs-5/5 some might say it's just like any other deviled eggs and I might agree but the texture of the egg was perfect and I love the fact that they classed it up with the caviar and the pancetta added the right amount of crispy fatty goodness I loved it.  The truffles mac and cheese- freaking 10/5 no really it was so cheesy with the right amount of truffle flavor you can't go wrong. It's more like crack and cheese instead of mac and cheese!  Finally we has the Butter Burger w/spicy tots-5/5 it was so freaking good. Burger was so juicy and had amazing flavor topped with all kinds of cheese and veggies. The bun was delicious and toasty and the spicy tots were crispy and season so good that plate also was on point.  For the {Libation} \"because no good love story or any story begins with someone ordering a salad\" we ordered the Magarian drink which had a bunch of stuff in it but it had me at cucumber soda and gin...the most refreshing drink ever with a great flavor of lemon, honey syrup and a hint if thyme who wouldn't want to just drink that all day in the hot summer heat then we got the St. Stephane's Belgian Blonde beer. All beer are in bottles nothing on tap but who cares when they are all so good.   All in all I can't wait to come back and try everything else like their chicken skins and their beef Wellington empanadas plus sip on their other Findlay crafted drinks.",

    "text": "Wow. This place is UH-mazing.  Located right by Old Town Vegas, it's definitely a hidden gem. The place is on a discrete location that really keep the \"tourists\" away and definitely has a more local vibe.   The ambience is a bit of a gastropub feel. High and low tables pack the cozy joint plus a full bar and stool that overlook that kitchen give it a very intimate atmosphere.  They also have a back patio where people can lounge and mingle while they wait for their table.   Did I mention that this place was created by the late Kerry Simon? This was also a major + as I have heard he was an amazing chef with unexpected creations.   We ordered several taps-style dishes that were all perfection. Note most food is made to share and come out as they are ready.   Crispy Chicken skins with smoke honey - definitely a must-try of fried goodness. Honey is a nice touch and complement to the skins.  Fried tempura with pepper jelly cream cheese - similar to the skins quite delicious. (note: I probably would only choose one or the other next time, it was a little too similar from a fried, finger-food standpoint)  New to the menu. SPAM sliders with seaweed salad, grilled pineapple and \"yummy\" sauce plus spicy tater tots - Probably my favorite dish.  Black Rice Oxtail Risotto with Parmesan Cheese - Oh so rich and you could just taste the flavor of the Risotto.  \"Devil's\" Eggs, crispy pancetta and caviar - Omg. you had me had deviled eggs. I think I could have eaten 3 orders of it easily.   We were sad to hear that we missed the pork belly but I am sure that dish would have been great.   They don't take reservations but it doesn't matter. You must try this place!!!!",

Well, to be honest; there are just too many places in Vegas that have better food for the money. Carson Kitchen isn't extremely expensive, but the portions are small and if you want to try various things (you should), it adds up. We probably could have eaten at a pretty nice steakhouse for the price we paid. Service was good. We were on the roof which was cool cuz the weather was awesome, but I don't know how that will be in the summer.   Bottom line: Neat place with good food, but you could get a better \"traditional\" meal for the price.",

We ended up being seated at the bar anyway and we ordered four items.  They bring food out when it's ready as opposed to bringing it all out together.

Everything on the menu sounded so delicious it was pretty hard to narrow down just 2 items. We got the cauliflower as an appetizer, I chose mac n cheese and hubby got the steak.  Everything was incredible. This mac and cheese is the best and since it's a secret family recipe all I could get out of our waitress Brooke is that it has 4 types of cheese. We could of easily finished it but we wanted to enjoy it the next day. Delicious as my breakfast. Will go back to try more and go for their dessert next time.",

    "text": "Visiting Vegas from out of town. After a long day at the Grand Canyon tour we wanted something good to eat but off the strip. So a Google search and Yelp search brought us here. I saw Yelp said it wasn't good for kids but I always caution that recommendation as I feel people lend towards a no go for kids if the place also has full bar. So I called talked to the hostess and said hey is there formal dining seating that would be appropriate for me to bring my teenage daughter and whether the place was kid friendly - hostess said yes definitely.    We took a lyft there and drove by it twice. The place is hard to find and Yelp says 124 but door says 100. Got in there and place is way smaller than I imagined. Then the seating isn't that formal. We were seated at an extension of the bar with other patrons. It was a high table top. I asked if we could change and per the hostess they had nothing else - disappointed in this aspect. In True hipster fashion form preceded function as seating layout is below average (and I'm a millennial so it's not like I'm a old head who doesn't understand).  Due to the seating layout I wouldn't recommend this place for children - which is fine but it would have been nice to been informed that on the phone when I inquired. Decor was nice.   Drinks - my aunt and I can ordered bar drinks - wine for aunt, mixed for me. Drinks were great, expensive but I think the environment/location warranted it. Nothing too crazy.   Appetizers - Burnt Ends and Deviled Eggs. Burnt ends were good, BBQ sauce a little too sweet but overall really good,I'd order again. Bread that came with it was not really edible, kind of stale. Deviled eggs had crispy pancetta and caviar on them. Pancetta was too crispy like a hard bacon bit, it would have been better if it had a little more give to it. The caviar didn't really add much of anything, the filling was good.   Entrees - we all ordered the butter burger. Burger was good and butter taste was phenomenal. The sharp cheese wasn't melted on burger and wasn't the right type of cheese for a burger, they also gave two slices of cheese which was way too much for a sharp cheese andthat was the only disappointing factor. Spicy tots weren't spicy but they were yummy.   Service - service was slow but people were personable in there.   Next time I'm in Vegas I wouldn't come back but glad I tried it. Definitely a True hipster restaurant.",

Note: They claim they change their menu 4 times a year, this is a good and a bad thing, don't go there because of the pictures, they might not have what you see, go there because on the 3 dishes I tried there was consistency and a lot of flavor.  I will come back for sure.",

You might also want to pair it with the mac n' cheese that they have. How about this, try putting bacon jam on top of your mac n' cheese and BOOM. This equals heaven.

I think they have seats outside and upstairs but were inside in the main area. We sat at a bar table with the kitchen right in front of us. I usually HATE watching my food being made but everything looked sanitary I didn't really mind. Everyone wore gloves when they prepared the food and washed Properly.   For foods; Cocoa-espresso NY steak-- delicious! Just the way I liked my steak made. Very tender, cooked medium rare but not deadly looking. The crust on the steak had a grill taste to it and the red wine demi gave it personality! one of the best steaks I ever had. It isn't a large portion though, I wish there was more meat to it!   Baked Mac & cheese-- secret ingredient was definitely Truffle! I know that amazing taste. Very very cheesy! They did not cheap out on the cheese. I loved how it was baked so the top had a nice crust on it giving it some texture when you eat it.   gyro tacos-- made with lamb but did not have that gamey taste that usually lamb has. There was a amazing yogurt sauce that gyros usually come with. It comes with 3 tacos and you wish it was 6! It is a nice size taco and not a miniature one. It really tasted like a taco even though it was lamb.   The staff were very attentive and checked in on us frequently but not bothersome. I definitely will be returning soon!",

After standing awkwardly out front of Carson Kitchen trying to find the restaurant hours, one of the employees opened up the entrance door and welcomed us in. The place was pretty empty, so we decided to sit at the kitchen bar on high-top stools for a cool view of the chefs in action.  BAKED MAC & CHEESE ($12): I was initially dismayed by the small-ish portion size, but my eyes were bigger than my stomach. The mac & cheese is deceiving since it's so filling. I couldn't even finish the whole thing. For shame! Great flavor and thickness level is on point.   GYRO TACOS ($10): My husband gobbled these tacos right up and was really satisfied with this dish.  Worth a return visit? Yes! Carson Kitchen is a great local restaurant in DTLV.  Service was A-okay and the restaurant looked cool and trendy. I want to head back to try out more items on the menu for sure.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #45",

The table was tiny and the only seats were stools, which was terribly uncomfortable, especially for someone with back issues. these were the main reasons for subtracting a star.  The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt - so no loss of stars for the service. I wasn't sure what to order to drink and the waiter was very helpful. I ended up with the sangria, which was tasty and strong.  We ordered the crispy chicken skins and \"devil's\" eggs to start. The skins were warm, crunchy, and absolutely delicious. It came with a honey for dipping, which was great since there was just a touch of spicy heat to the skins. The egg were seasoned just right and the caviar gave it a little 'pop'. I preferred the skins and my husband went for the eggs, but that is just a matter of preference, since they were both wonderful.   We decided to share the short rib grilled cheese, which was okay, but a bit bland, especially after the well-seasoned apps.   For dessert we shared the glazed donut bread pudding and it was awesome! Everything about it was delicious, including the creme anglais and the caramel sauce.   I would definitely recommend Carson Kitchen, and will be going back. Just a heads up - it doesn't have any outside signage, just the name painted in the bottom corner of the window. I almost missed it and I know what I was looking for.",

It's literally a little hole in the wall which I love, and the inside is small with a very cozy ambiance. We were seated at the corner of a large rectangular table, seats away from a couple.   We ordered the jalapeno poppers and the deviled eggs for appetizers. The deviled eggs were great (a little on the saltier side though) with large bits of bacon on top. The jalapeno poppers were larger than I would have liked. I had to use a fork and knife but would have rather popped small bites into my mouth. It also was not as cheesy as I was hoping for.   I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and was very disappointed. For some reason it tasted more like a taco pizza. Although there were bits of chicken, I'm almost positive there was some ground beef on there too. Strange.  My friends ordered the NY strip steak and the baked mac and cheese. They weren't impressed by the steak but enjoyed the mac and cheese.   We had a male server who was great. Nothing to complain about the service.  I honestly won't be coming back because I wasn't impressed by the food, which was what I was really looking forward to trying. I took the pizza to go to originally bring it back to my roommate but I ended up giving it to a homeless man on Fremont St.",

    "text": "Well worth the Uber trip off the strip to eat here. The food is fabulous. Hubby and I got a selection of small plates including bacon jam, devil's eggs, veal meatballs, and beet salad. First of all, the bacon jam is awesome and tastes good on everything. You will have more bacon jam than you can use up with the accompanying bread, so I highly recommend putting it on everything else you order. It makes everything taste better :) We also got a couple of desserts to try, although we couldn't finish them. The donut bread pudding is divine and so is the fudge brownie. There was not a misstep in the bunch. Definitely go out of your way to try this place. It's worth it!",

I've only been here a few times but I've noticed the menu has changed very slightly with each visit.   Last night we ordered the crispy chicken skins, rainbow cauliflower, shrimp dunderi, and jerk turkey burger. The chicken skins are served with smoked honey and oh so addictive. They are best enjoyed fresh as they can become slightly hard and chewy if you leave them sitting towards the end of your meal. The cauliflower was crunchy, lemony, and refreshing. The shrimps were huge and the dunderi was pillowy perfection. It's basically gnocchi that is made with cheese rather than potatoes. Need I say more? The turkey burger was the real highlight of last night's meal. The patty was huge and juicy. I totally forgot that it was turkey! The sweetness from the mango chutney slaw complemented it so well, I wish it had more.   I'd love to see this place expand to a larger locations. Not a huge fan of communal seating since I'm a lefty and always end up bumping someone's elbow. It's a small price to pay for delicious food. I'll be back!",

Specifically ask for rooftop seating.  It was so worth it!!  BBQ burnt ends:  MUST HAVE.  FANTASTIC.  The pickles were AMAZING. Bacon jam:  Delicious and adds well to other plates.   Gyro tacos:  PHENOM!! Filet-ohhh-fish:  Friend liked it but a bit salty for my taste.  Large burger. Young beets:  NEED TO GET THIS SO GOOD. Black rice and oxtail risotto:  Mild flavored but delicious nonetheless.  The bacon jam tastes so good with this. Baked mac and cheese:  SO cheesy!!!  And tastes AMAZING with the bacon jam! Wild mushroom flatbread:  Unique but tasty!  Mushroom was smokeyish tasting and the onions are a bit sour so if you like that, this is it for you!    The magarian (drink):  Very, VERY GOOD.  Very clean, fresh and such a nice summer drink!  Rainbow cauliflower was sold out but that made me want to eat it more.  Had 5 people and this filled us to the point where we were having breathing problems.  Here's where you'll ask how much it is.  About $54/person with alcohol, food, and tip included!  Service was AMAZING.  Everyone was super friendly, super helpful and super nice.  (I love the word super, apparently).  Experience was amazing!!!  Will come back!!",

My husband ordered the drink \"Communication Breakdown\" and it was delicious with a flavor we have never tasted before. It was excellent. Unique, smoky & delicious. Bacon Jam w/ baked brie & toast for our appetizer. Rich, delicious and perfect before we had what I would call the best Salmon I have ever had  in a restaurant. The Salmon with Spinach Pistou and charred lemon. This was off the charts good and I want to commend the cook for NOT over cooking our salmon!! It was cooked perfectly. Outside had a nice crust on it and it tasted fantastic. Ending this fantastic meal with The Glazed Donut Bread Pudding was just another aha moment as to why Carson Kitchen is the place to eat downtown with their unique menu as well as skilled individuals making the food. We will be back soon! Can't wait to eat here again. Thanks for making our night great!",

Unfortunately they don't do small party reservations. The hostess told me to call about 10 min before arriving to ask about the wait. We arrived around 8:15pm and told the wait was 1 hour. We went to the upstairs bar and ordered \"cashme ousside\" (double rye whiskey, bitters, eggwhites, ancho Reyes and fresh lemon). It was refreshing, and light. We were seated around 9:30pm. Service was quick, after ordering we waited maybe 15-20 min for our food. We ordered the butter burger, gyro tacos, and the bacon jam. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone - whether you're a Vegas local or visiting.",

My Usual gin and tonic was supplanted by a sublime concoction of honey, gin, cucumber and thyme.  We shared the tempura green beans, which were lightly fried and salted and accompanied by a delectable dipping sauce. We then split the turkey burger that was crunchy, tangy, sweet and well seasoned and matched with spicy tater tots. Hip, fun and friendly - what more could you ask for??",

It was good, and more than half of our group liked it, but I thought it was only OK. It's like bacon but sweetened into a jam. You can ask for additional bread, but they WILL charge you for the extra bread.  Tempura Green Beans -- 4 stars. Good, but probably not worth the calories.  Crispy Chicken Skins -- 4 stars. Good, but IMO not worth the calories.  Gyro Tacos -- 4 stars. Tasty, but for $11 you get only 3 small tacos.  Baked Mac & Cheese -- 4 stars. Good, super cheesy and creamy, but I would've liked some additional oomph -- would've been 5 stars with some crunchy topping and some bacon!  Donut Bread Pudding -- 5 stars. Delicious and decadent. The donut had a crispy crust that was delightful.",

    "text": "Simple dishes but creative, delicious and worthy of a return. I had the black rice and oxtail risotto and hubby had the espresso rubbed New York steak both dishes were perfectly seasoned and cook. This was my 4-5th time (surprised to see I didn't have any reviews) at this juncture and the service and quality always deliver. The chimichurri dallioped over the rich creamy risotto was the cherry on the top - awesome blend of olive oil with permeating flavors of parsley, cilantro, shallots and then some. The generous slivers of buttery oxtail was the perfect ratio to starch. His steak was also amazing - unconventionally rubbed with cocoa and espresso (?) - fired just right to his liking and was \"well - rested\". This place, did I mention is perfect for sharing. We wanted to get some rainbow cauliflower but our belly whiny allow it. Funny story how we ended up here, if I may. We actually left \"Jerry's Nugget\" - ditched our table at the cafe after sitting there for 20mins waiting for our waiter to take our order... on a very slow day no less. We intended to get the mammoth 30oz prime rib and a Greek staple called spanakopita (mine of course). I'm glad we made the switch. We would have spent the same amount of cash for a less memorable meal and ecky service. Carson Kitchen never disappoints- the late chef Kerry Simon's legacy lives on! Ohh and we also sat by the chefs prep area which was a visual treat. A dance like no other",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here looking for a nice quiet meal away from the lights and buffet tables, and I sincerely wished we had saved our money.   Our experience started with a snobby host who balked at our request to sit up on the patio roof. Our waitress (who in all honesty seemed to be having a rough night) was crass, overly familiar, and inattentive. The food was almost inedibly over-seasoned, and for our $100 tab, the only saving grace was the booze.   We tried the crispy green-beans (good), the chicken skins (awful. so over-seasoned and chewy), the steak (cooked okay but drowning in what tasted like soy sauce), and the cauliflower (inedible. seriously the lemon was so strong it burned).  My boyfriend made the observation that this place really wants to do fine, innovative dining, but had absolutely no idea how to go about it. Our grumpy waitress made a few off-hand comments about \"trouble in the kitchen\" and how this place \"sucks\", so perhaps our experience was the result of a truly awful night. That doesn't change the fact that we had to have a rather awful date night with them...  The atmosphere was lovely, the cocktails were well made, but I would steer clear of the food and staff.",

Small, casual, laid back tapas (why does saying this word make me feel like a wannabe hipster) joint with variety of options most but not all with a Southern lean.  The plates come out pretty quick so it's easy to pace yourself.  The chicken skins are like cracklin that tastes like fried chicken, i.e. dey good.  Bacon jam, burnt ends, mac&cheese = tasty.  Mini tacos, coffee crusted steak and turkey burger all good but not great.  Place works best with small group or even for two with a fat attitude because you'll want to try a chunk of the menu.",

Right - I didn't eat all of that in one visit. Stop judging me... I like food.

Been wanting to try this place for awhile and glad I followed through with it.  Got there around 1:30. Place was packed. Immediately greeted by a smiling face and felt welcome from the second we walked in. She took us over to two seats at the bar. Greeted by the bartender in a timely manner, very friendly. She got our drinks and kinda read the situation, we haven't opened our menus, talking to eachother, as I hadn't seen this friend in awhile and we met out front of the restaurant so literally just catching up with her for the first time in awhile. Bartender gave us time to catch up and then we started to glance at the menus. Wanted one of everything! Haha. Ended up getting a few of the apps and a watermelon feta cheese salad. Food came out in timely manner and was explained when it was dropped off which is always a nice touch.  All in all this place has got it goin on. Great job, everyone from the food runner to the hostess. Great job.",

Between 8 of us we shared an order of Gyro Taco's, Bacon Jam, BBQ Burnt Ends, Sea bass, NY Strip, Black Rice Oxtail Risotto, and the Crispy Chicken Skins w/ Honey. Then my best friend and I split the Butter Burger. Everything was absolutely delicious. I could have done without the Chicken Skins, but other than that, everything was incredibly flavorful, decent portion sizes to reflect the price, very friendly servers who were very knowledgeable about each item on the menu. (Bianca was our server). The atmosphere of this place is so relaxing. It's a smaller place, making it more intimate and calm. Awesome lighting and decor. Can't wait to go back!",

We had heard good things, so on our recent trip, we knew we were going to carve out a day for DTLV and Carson Kitchen would be on the agenda. Can I just say that THE best way to kick off a night in DTLV is here?!  We ordered drinks first - of course. From there, we knew it was only to get better, but you MUST try the Get Shorty and the Driving with the Ms. UNBELIEVABLE...and paired so well with our social plates. It was an act of God to pull me away from the bar and not order a 3rd/4th.  Sarah, our AMAZING bartender/server, was super helpful because we were pouring over the menu and being greedy little piggies...I was hell bent on ordering 3 social plates, a side of Mac 'n Cheese, and possibly a 4th social plate. She told me to slooooow my roll...it would be way too much for us and that if we were still in the market for more, we could always order another plate or two. Thank you for saving me, Sarah.  Bacon Jam: Sugar and spice and everything nice...I love EVERYTHING about this and would spread it on the toes of a stranger, walking barefoot on the strip, and gladly eat it again.   Gyro Tacos: My husband devoured - to be truthful, I was 3 bites into one (of our 4) before he swooped in to take care of the rest. The flavor of the lamb was perfect, the shell/pita was soft and chewy - perfectly done.   Chicken Skins: I can't even deal...nor will I EVER look at chicken skin the same again. Ever. Slightly spicy (not hot), paired with the sweetness of the honey. It's like crack in chip form.   Needless to say, we waddled out - sans Mac 'n Cheese - totally in love. We've found our new FAVORITE LV restaurant - hands down.   Keep up the great work, CK. We'll see you again next year!",

The best part is dessert, and I have never had anything so delicious that I still dream about it to this day....the donut bread pudding! I'm sure I am 100 times more likely to die of. Heart attack in the next 3 years because of it but if I do it was well worth it! There were so many interesting things to eat, we couldn't fit them all in one trip so, of course, we had to go back to try them all!  The chicken skins were so good. If you like pork rinds, you will love the chicken skins. Not one bit of greasiness and the seasoning is so good. Not salty with a bit of spiciness. We had the bacon jam as well. It's made with jalapenos so it may be too hot for some people but it was good, I just thought it was hard to pair with the food we were trying to sample. The staff is friendly and helpful. The kitchen and restaurant is clean and has a uniqueness that make this place stand out.  It just  feels like home.",

The tempura green beans & Mac and cheese were the table favorites. Everyone also enjoyed some spicy shrimp appetizer, the mushroom flat bread and the burger w/ spicy tots (the burger was HUGE). We ordered 5 plates to share and it was too much food. We should have only ordered 3.   The cool vibe of bigger bar tables is fun but it's hard to share the table with other parties sitting elbow to elbow. I was seated next to a party of 2 who ordered multiple appetizers, which gave me very little room for my plate, let alone my drink & flatware. We could have sat on the patio but it was too hot out. Elbow to elbow is the lesser of two evils.  I'd recommend this place for sure!! It's a nice break from the typical noisy, tacky and bigger Vegas spots we've tried!!

    "text": "Loved the food, we started off with the bacon jam.  The truffle (oops, that is a secret) Mac and cheese was our favorite, then the turkey burger, which was okay.  Our least favorite was the brocolli salad, just kinda bland.  The burger comes with tater tots!  The ambiance is nice. The seating is different.  We were at a table for six, there were three of us.  These tables have hard bottom short stools, no back, to sit upon.  If you are coming in alone or as a couple, they sit you at the bar table, which is in kinda a u-shape and strangers sit across from you.  Those chairs/stools have backs and are taller.  We want to go back and try other items some day.  Hiked outside of Red Rock park, calico basin road, and hiked past Ash Canyon Creek, it's called Gateway Saddle to canyon.....this morning (under gloomy foggy skies, but nonetheless incredibly beautiful.",

I believe there was just one out of the four we tried that we liked on the cocktail menu. The wine was okay as well... The beet salad was over priced and way too small. I'm vegan and wish there was more on the menu. Everyone else seemed to like the food a lot... The bacon jam was a hit for the table and the burgers looked interesting. The service was a little slow. I waited fifteen min for a glass of wine. The location is small but I did like the seating to be totally honest, which is what everyone else seemed to complain about. I would give it another shot, maybe for lunch with a different bartender.",

I don't feel like I'm a cheap person when it comes to food, I'm really willing to go all out for a special occasion, but we spent nearly $60 here and left seriously very hungry. I'd be happy with the expense if it was amazing food, but it was just.... Meh. I got the seared scallops and they were cold and sort of fishy. And it was literally 3 bites of food, so I sort of felt like a fool for working out all week and saving up my calories. Only reason I'm leaving 2 stars was the drink I ordered was just superb. I don't often order cocktails but it was worth every penny and I loved it. Food was very.... Meh.  We went to jack in the box after. The buttery jack was probably more enjoyable than my 3 scallops.",

Wasn't crazy about the Brie and bacon jam, but everything else was A+. The white sangria with peach puree is haunting my dreams because it was SO DELICIOUS.

    "text": "I loved my experience here!  When I found myself in the Freemont Street area on a Friday night I turned to Yelp for restaurant suggestions.  The reviews were spot on.  Carson Kitchen is amazing.   We were happy that there was no wait to be seated.  This was because we were OK with being seated at one of the communal tables.  Even though they are shared tables, you still have your own space and a decent amount of privacy.  We were in the back corner of the restaurant which gave us a great view of the fun scene that unfolds in this restaurant. The server was friendly and informative.  She gave us plenty of information without being pushy or rude.  When we had questions, she answered them politely.  This was very helpful as we weren't sure how much and what to order.  She suggested 1-2 plates per person.   We ordered the bacon jam to share, I ordered the tempura green beans and my dining companion ordered the jerk turkey burger.   Food is brought out as it is ready (instead of in a specific order, like a salad or appetizer first).   Everything we tried was phenomenal.  The bacon jam was totally unique and totally amazing.  A great combination of sweet and savory.  It included the bacon jam and some spreadable cheese on top.  It is served with bread.  The only slight down side is that I did wish it came with more bread,  You can order extra for $1 or so.  But you can also eat the jam by the spoonful (it is that good).  It does take awhile to cool.  The green beans were served with a cream cheese/hot pepper spread.  The beans had a crispness to them and the amount of breading on them was perfect.  I came hungry and was totally satisfied with splitting the bacon jam and eating the green beans.  My dining companion had the jerk turkey burger and commented that it was one of the tastiest she's ever had. An all around wonderful experience.",

There are a plethora of food choices and we went with the burnt ends, filet oh fish sandwich, and the butter burger with non spicy tater tots and a salad. The burnt ends were so tender and juicy and coming from KC where the BBQ is to die for, I was throughly impressed. It came with some toast and pickles that weren't as 'pickly' as we were expecting. Tasted like mildly flavored cucumber instead, but still killed it. Both entrees were good, we kept joking around saying the burger was A PERFECT burger bc it came out and you could see each ingredient between the bun, perfectly and everything was lined up, evenly. The salad was so fresh and I loved the vinaigrette it came with.    The service was on point. Our server was fun and even when he was off doing something else, someone else ran us our food and he, too was pleasant!   Our check came out in a book, with little notes and greetings written inside. Super cute.   All in all! Definitely worth checking out. I love the downtown area and this place embodies why",

The staff does a fantastic job tying it all together with their friendliness and fun attitude.  Luckily we sat at the front bar right in front of the kitchen.  They don't take reservations so I guess we just got lucky. I cant wait to go back and try more dishes. Maybe next time even check out the roof top patio in the mean time here are some must get items...  The best of the bunch: Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip and at only $19 its a steal! Top apps: Veal Meatballs and \"Devil's\" Eggs (with caviar) yum...$8-12 what! Other tasty treats: Crispy Chicken Skins and the BLT Salad  All you visitors to LV, break away from the strip and check out Carson Kitchen downtown.  You will not be disappointed.",

NY STRIP. it was dry. We ordered medium rare which t came out that way but t was so chewy and just poor quality steak with a sauce not that flavorful.   TEMPURA GREEN BEANS -too fried and over cooked. The cream cheese wasn't a good mix with he fried. The whole dish was too greasy and too heavy.   BURNT ENDS- were pretty good.   DEVILED EGGS- were okay.",

Things a bit different this time, we have a 1.5 year old and I couldn't remember if it was set up to accommodate families or not, so I made a quick call and spoke with Emily. She assured me that even though they don't have high chairs or stroller storage that they would be more than ecstatic to make sure we were comfortable! We went in around 330 pm or 4 to avoid their potential dinner rush, where Emily greated is at the door. She got us all set up at or table, and was amazingly sweet! We ordered devils eggs (which were just as amazing as we remembered!), baked Mac and cheese and the butter burger. All of the food was outstanding! Just as awesome as it was 3 years ago. I'm glad with all the ups and downs in Vegas, carsons kitchen has stuck around even though they're just a small hole in the wall!   Management, if you're reading this, you've got a keeper with Emily! She made our whole experience and put my mind at ease! Keep her around, and remind her how amazing she is!",

It's actually around the corner.    Water was served almost immediately and the waitress was really nice. She wasn't too pushy and was there when we needed her.   I ordered the coffee rubbed ny steak for $19. It's not pricy for red meat but it came with nothing else. Only meat. By far not the best steak I've had. I didn't taste any coffee but was happy that it came out medium rare like I asked for. I also tried my friend's beef stroganoff which I did not like. The portion size was super small and to me it tasted oddly like chocolate.   I also tried the bison sliders. They were a little dry but I enjoyed the flavor of the meat and the sweet jam it came with. All burgers and sandwiches came with a side of spicy tator tots which were delicious!  By far the best thing there. I also tried the lamb gyros. For $10 bucks you get three gyro tacos and they were pretty yummy. Best bang for your buck.   The restaurant is small and can get really loud.  But it has a very cozy hipster atmosphere. I don't think I will come back again but it's a cool hangout spot.",

There's a cool vibe interior patio to grab drinks and wait for your table.

I feel like the chef enjoys Mexican flavors because the undertones are there. The steak seasoning/rub would be divine on steak tacos. The portions are exquisitely portioned in that 3-4 plates to share for every 2 people and you've got a incredible meal without overeating.  This place is a hidden gem.

No matter where I go I always ask for the sweetest drink on the menu and the bartender suggested for me the Sallynoggin (Jameson whiskey, luxardo maraschino, fernet vittone, cinzano bianco, peychaud's bitters). Don't know most of the ingredients but I was satisfied with her suggestion. Nothing better than an employee who knows what they are recommending to their guests. 5/5.  My friend and I ordered the roasted rainbow cauliflower to share. I appreciated the amount of the lemon juice to the dish. It brightened up the dish definitely. Very simple but perfectly done. 5/5.  I ordered for myself the forbidden black rice risotto with oxtail and my friend ordered the shepherd's 3.14.   Risotto came out first. Rice was aldente and definitely a True risotto. Not too dry. Not too runny. Just the perfect consistency. However the oxtail meat that was pulled from the bone was missed in the dish. I only got one big chunk in the very center of the plate. The forbidden rice was just a little too al dente for my liking. I understand it has a different consistency than arborio rice but it wasn't that bad enough to put me off from clearing my plate. Just to add a touch more flavor I added the colored cauliflower with each bite and definitely the lemon brought a much needed pop to the flavor profile. 4/5.  For my friend's Shepherd's 3.14 (gnocchi, lamb, natural jus), their take on a shepherd's pie was lacking in the starch. Don't get me wrong. The presentation was appealing. The small three pieces of gnocchi, not so much. I wanted to taste it but didn't want to take it away from my friend. Our expectation was a little bit more lamb but instead we found a mixture of ground and stewed lamb meat? Seasoning was a little but lacking of salt but then again I am a salt fiend. I stopped from taking tasting bites so my friend could finish his meal. 4/5.  As small as the plates were in portion, by the end we were surprisingly full. One thing the bartender mentioned to another guest that I over heard when they were asked how big the plates were... the plates are big enough to share. Not so much haha. I would suggest you get an entree for yourself and get a side or two to share. But definitely don't share your entree with anyone else haha. Overall always great time when spent with a friend or two or three or more. Their seasonal menu is always appreciated. Definitely will always come to support whenever possible.",

I just don't feel like flagging them down to take my orders. Plus, I don't even know which ones are servers or customers. It's pretty bad to mistakenly call someone and thinking they could be one of the servers. Maybe a uniform polo shirts for everyone? And also, Chefs could at least use a hair mask at least. But, overall, I liked the food and the ambiance.",

    "text": "So yum!! I bookmarked this place before going to Vegas after looking at restaurants on and off the strip. Of course they had me at bacon jam!  Came at an off hour - about 2pm and no line, no wait and barely anyone in the restaurant. Wasn't too hungry so we ordered just the bacon jam and brie and the steak. It was just enough for a light mean or snack. Both were excellent! I really recommend the bacon jam and brie. It has a nice touch of sweet/salty with a hint of spice in it. The brie is actually a very small piece, majority of the dish is the bacon jam. We ran out of bread and they gave us a bit more.  Wish I could've tried more but it was enough to at least say I got to eat here!  I see a lot of people posting pictures of their swear jar here. I noticed dollars and cents in it so I asked the server if there are different amounts based on what swear word they say. He said the jar is actually for customers to tip the kitchen staff. So if your food was so awesome and you swear when you eat it, you put some money in there. Cleaver idea though as a customer, I don't think I would know that's what it's for (maybe there's a sign, but I wasn't sitting near it).  Although the address says 6th street, I believe the entrance door is actually on Carson street. It's just down and around from the Fremont Experience.  Atmosphere is cool, love the vibe in here. HIgh and low tables available but very limited seating. I would say maybe holds 40?",

It was packed when we arrived, but they have a wonderful patio with a fire pit at which one can await  seating. Very nice.

My dad's trout and cauliflower on the other hand was pretty well made, and the veel meatballs were sort of springy tasting so that was nice and the bourbon brownie was good with the icecream.  But considering you pay 30 to 50 per person it was too expensive for food that i consider nice but not that nice.",

Went in for an early dinner on our most recent trip and really liked it.  We try many new restaurants every time we travel to Vegas and Carson Kitchen is one of our favorites.  This alone is a reason to go the the Fremont neighborhood.  It's a casual gastropub.  Very cool design with open kitchen.  We shared a lot of small plates and all were delicious.  We tried four of their house cocktails and loved them all.  This will be a regular stop for us.",

The mac 'n cheese was very good too, but it would have been better to have ordered it at another time because it too was fairly salty although still very good.  The gyro tacos were excellent as was the glazed doughnut bread pudding!  The place is very hard to find (no signage and you enter from Carson St, not 6th, as the address would suggest.

The second time I went we got seated at the bar. The bar is weirdly designed so you can't scoot your barstool close and the bar doesn't overhang enough. Anyways, I felt uncomfortable and like I was hunched over to reach the bar. So we were seated and a waitress got us water. Then that was it. Staff buzzed around us but no one took our order. After 20 minutes we just left. So weird.  The third time there was an hour+ wait. We left. Get there by 11-11:30 or don't go.  The fourth time we got there at 11:30 & got seated. I asked for a table & the hostess looked uncomfortable since the only table left was a 6-top, but their bar design sucks so I wanted a table.   Anyways, the food was amazing. I had the fried green tomato crab sandwich. Soooo yummy. I scarfed it. The tomato was really great with the crab. Lots of crab and how ever it's cooked, it's great. A little messy but just delish. My friend got the butter burger. It was huge. It had two cheeses on it and looked like they did a good job of cooking it medium well per her order. The spicy tots were good...a little greesy but I ate them all.  Overall I like this place but go early and they aren't winning points for service. I'd mark them lower for the terrible service but the food is just awesome.",

We made reservations at Carson's Kitchen  based on the reviews,  and the outdoor patio area, which they told me when I made the reservation that it would be a great spot for a larger group, and with the heaters this time of year it would be a perfect setting. When we arrived they seated us downstairs, the waitress said they \"didn't have propane for the heaters\".  It was so noisy that our group could not carry on a conversation, they were out of side dishes that we wanted to order,  when we received our meals, they were very small portions, even the dinner portions were pricey for what we got. The food was good,  but nothing was great. (We all ordered different things). Really disappointing since there are so many awesome places to dine in Vegas. We hoped for a special place for our celebration, and honestly this definitely was not that at all. Unfortunately, for our group, this was a big fail. I don't think anyone in our party of 12 will return to Carson's Kitchen.",

    "text": "Hello and welcome to Carson Kitchen. This has been on my to go to list for a long time. Finally ventured DT to check it out. Bacon Jam, that is all I am saying. Well, not really, this is a mix of bacon and spices with a small slice of cheese on top. Served with grilled bread. We sat at the kitchen bar where we could see the Chefs at work. For our main meal I got the butter burger mid rare and Josie got the New York. We were encouraged to try the Mac n Cheese because it would be the best we ever had. (You don't know me) I thought. When you say this it better be so good I cant get enough. It was not. Honestly I make a decent home made mac which according to Josie is better. Burger was really good with an aged white cheddar on top. Had a smoked flavor and that sharp bite from the aged cheese. Steak was perfcetly cooked mid rare. I could say it could have used maybe some salt after the cook, but that is splitting hairs. Overall a great meal and great service. Our waiter was friendly and on top of the drinks. It was nice watching the pass and seeing the food being expedited.  Thank you for eating at Carson Kitchen. I really want to return here and try some different items and to see what may change seasonably. If in the DT area, give it a try.",

    "text": "Hidden in the mean streets of DT Las Vegas. You really have to be someone with the intent to come to Carson Kitchen. It's very low key, without any vibrant neon lights or flashy sign to attract you (if you were a tourist). So to me I think this place is the very essence of what you can call local. You won't know unless you've seriously heard it from a local person, and have done your research.  Word of mouth? I think really does this place good. The great food and service really speaks for itself, and well everyone is talking about it too!  *VEAL MEATBALLS: I'm not a big Veal person, but this is a choice you just have to make. If you're the carnivore type. I would go for it. It has that wonderful rich flavor, filling taste and texture. This can possibly fill you, but if you are just all about meats. Give it a go.  *NY STRIP STEAK: Can't go wrong with steak right? Juicy tenderness (they know the difference between their medium rare and rare)! I ordered a medium rare. It had that nice well and flavorful outer layer, and that nice slightly but not too pink middle. Perfecto!  RAINBOW CAULIFLOWER: You need your daily dose of veggies. If you're not a big veggie person, or a salad person! I would suggest trying this. The flavors are rich enough, and the veggie is so subtle in taste that you can barely tell they're vegetables.  *BLACK RICE & OXTAIL RISOTTO: Forever and ever. I love this dish so much. It's very rich too and jam packed with cheese. You'll see what I mean. Every pull. Every scoop from a fork you'll see a nice lovely trail of melted cheese holding on to your fork, making it's way to your mouth. It's a party for your taste buds.   WILD MUSHROOM FLATBREAD: AMAZING! I would like to thank the Carson Kitchen gods (well, more so the manager) for hooking us up with a complimentary flatbread. Flatbread is also great! Big portion (this will take a good portion of your appetite). So, if you have the intent of trying the heavier dishes, I'd just take a pass on this. Unless you're really craving a flatbread.  BROCCOLI CRUNCH: Great salad. I'd vouch for it, it has a nice sweet taste to it, with a good crunch from the nuts. Although, amongst all the other plates, this may not have shined as much as the others.  Service: In the humblest way, I love their gesture for not wasting food, and these small acts of services they provide to just give their customers an extra kick to their evening. We all know miss orders can happen, and well the manager was kind enough to first, kindly ask if we have food allergies (way to go!), and then, proceeded to offer a complimentary dish due to a mis-order. Way-to-go Carson Kitchen on being proactive.  Waitress was super attentive with us, and very helpful as far as alternatives (chicken skins and bacon jams was sold out). She knows her dishes. She came by periodically and checked on us and of course. She too had a great sense of humor. Love this place!",

It is a hidden gem near downtown Las Vegas.  Be forewarned this place does get CROWDED. It is small so they can only hold so many people in there. We went on a weeknight and it was packed. They have a really cute patio that is all lit up and is fun to go out and eat on or have a drink.  The menu may or may not change seasonally. Everything we had ordered was super unique and the taste test on it won 10 out of 10. We will be coming back here for sure. One of our new favorite spots and downtown fremont is not far so you can walk around that when you are done.",

We sat at the bar in front of the kitchen which was entertaining and gave us the opportunity to speak briefly with a cook.    The staff were all very friendly and attentive.  The drinks from the bar were excellent.  We had their version of a margarita and a drink with sage in it.  Both were creative and tasty.    The menu was also very innovative.  Our favorite dishes were the green eggs and ham flat bread and the veal meat balls with foie gras cream sauce.  Naughty, but superb.    If I owned a restaurant this is how I would hope to do it.  Can't wait to go back.",

Neither did my friend. It was overwhelmingly hot. And not in a good way. I don't mind some spice and flavor, but this was neither.

    "text": "After my second mediocre experience here, I thought I better write up a review. This place has tons of hype which may be why I found it so disappointing.    Ambiance - There are only 4 actual tables at this restaurant all the other seating is at group dining bars where your legs dangle while you sit in their uncomfortable bar chairs. The first time I ate here we were seated at the actual bar and while it was very loud in the restaurant I was able to enjoy my friends company.   On my second trip here we were seated at the shared table across from a couple who had their tongues down each other's throat the whole time and a father who was lecturing his daughter loudly on how to make it in the business world and she \"better shape up or ship out\".  I understand this is not within the restaurants control however I would certainly prefer to have an option rather than shared dining but as a party of two we were not afforded that luxury.   Service - The first visit they were busy but by sitting at the bar we were able to flag down the bartender to get our orders relatively fast. The second visit I arrived first and my server asked if I would like to wait to order, I informed him I would order before my companion arrived but I needed a minute to look over the menu. After waiting for him to return for some time I turned awkwardly around from my place at the bar extension to place my order for a drink with the bartender. My drink arrived but still no server so again I ordered our appetizer from the bar. The place was busy but there was plenty of servers and I spent the rest of the dinning experience hunting down my server. When it came time to pay I ended up getting off the horrible chair to just find someone to pay so that I no longer had to sit on those horrid chairs and I could get out of there.   Food - The first trip we ordered: Jalapeno Poppers - Delicious, I recommend them highly Baked Mac & Cheese - Excellent if not a bit on the small side Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto - Such high hopes, but way over salted and the rice was not cooked it was crunchy  Second and last trip: Bacon Jam - Zero flavor, the best part was the bread Roasted young beets - meh nothing special here at all Pork Belly Carbonara- Again high hopes only to be let down, the pork was fine but nothing special the pasta was mediocre  The uncomfortable seating, small pretentious menu and awful service will keep me from coming back.",

    "text": "A couple of my friends have been raving about this place; so my buddy and I decided to give it a try today.   Ugh!  Never again!  The place is small and loud.  Initially, we were seated at a high top table with strangers.  I didn't want my neighbors to hear our conversation; so we asked to move.  No problem said the hostess.  We struggled to find something to order off the menu.  Tried the bacon jam since it has gotten rave reviews.  It was okay--not something to write home about.  I ordered the fried chicken sandwich.  Hated the spread on the sandwich and not impressed with the chicken.  Enjoyed the tater tots.  My friend ordered the beef stroganoff.  Neither one of us finished our meal and we both declined to have any of it boxed up.  $50.00 not well spent for today's lunch.  Carson Kitchen is busy; so I doubt they will be missing our business in the future.  It's a hip place, but I'd rather be well fed and square.",

Now, if the food really knocked my socks off (which it did not) I would be alright with the portions, but damn, feed me for those prices. I will not return and feel this place is a ripp-off. I can't believe all of the positive reviews on here...Well, I on second thought, Las Vegas locals voted Olive Garden the best Italian restaurant in Vega$ for almost 10 years, so you can see the mentality of this city.",

    "text": "We arrived at Carson's Saturday afternoon after searching for it as we drove down Carson Street. The resturant is situated in the Old John Carson Hotel.  You have to look for it. The name is located on the lower part of the window in black letters, hard to distiguish with the glare from the sun. We entered  Carson's K and there were a few people there and it was nice a quiet. The place is nicely decorated and we like the mixture of woods, metal and tile work. The kitchen is open which I liked but the tables are mostly big tables that I assume you would share with other people you do not know if your party is only two people. That would not be so bad if the stools were not so close together. I am have wide shoulders and so does my partner and to be honest, it is not comfortable if you are paying for an experience.  I like experiences but not if I am being intruded by people who are sitting right on top of me.   We sat in at a table across from the bar with a view of the old Post Office. We were immediately greeted by our server who was friendly and listed all of the foods that we had questions about. She took our drink order and after some time we ate our first choice,  the Crispy Chicken skins......Ok, we normally do not eat skin, but this was pure heaven. They were crisp and perfectly seasoned. I like the honey sauce that came along with it.   A short time later, our orders arrived:  me the Fried Green Tomato with lump crab ravigote. It was great. I wish there more tomatoes on it. The tomatoes were lightly breaded and fried.  PERFECT!!!!  Kerry, tell the cooks to put more on there. The tator tots were crispy and fresh and not as greasy as I thought they would be.   My other half had the Butter Burger with boursin and chedder. The cheese was a little too heady (spelling?) and it did not taste so hot. The burger itself was good. It was not dry and had a great flavor to it. My partner ate it all up after scraping the cheeses off.   Our services was good, not great.  Our drinks were never refilled or were we asked if we wanted more to drink....bad!!!  When I go out, I want service, not half hearted, come on strong them leave me waiting. That is not a way to win a repeat. Aside from that, everything else was good. I am not sure if we will be back. The place is small and I can not imagine how crowded it must get at night.  I wonder why they did not build a larger space.   FOOD:                A ATMOSPHERE: A SERVICE:          C PRICE:               B the portions are enough if you are starving.",

    "text": "Today I took my wife to lunch here and we both ordered the butter burger. The burgers were a little under cooked so we sent them back and the waitress informed us that they would make us two fresh burgers. Unfortunately my wife had to go back to work so I paid for both burgers and informed the waitress that I would return to pick them up. When I returned to pick the burgers up I didn't inspect them because I assumed they would be two fresh burgers, not the case! Come to find out the cook took the same two patties that we sent back, that was fully dressed had been cut in half and physically touched by us and placed back on the grill and served back to us. The only difference was the dressing was new. Couldn't very well give us the same dressings,  that would be un professional.  This has to be not only the tackiest but most blatant  disrespect I have experienced at a restaurant. I reached out to the restaurant before writing this review,  and basically was told this is how it's done and is the norm for most eateries. I beg to differ, I can't see Glutton, nor Eat nor any other of the fine restaurants we like to frequent would say this is common practice. The irony of it all is, my wife suggested Glutton but I choose to go to Carson and pay $28 for their butter burger. Never again! My wife also wrote a review and received basically the same response from owner Cory Harwell ( it is what it is ) note, there are over 100 other negative reviews on this restaurant. I guess the days of customer service have been lost here.",

    "text": "first and foremost the service provided by one of the chefs was some of the best service i have ever seen by a chef. i am blanking on his name but i believe it was chef mccloud. from the moment we sat down at the counter of the kitchen he was attentive, nice, and personal. i went with my girlfriend and her daughter celebrating my bday, when he found that out he wished me happy bday, and made that night very memorable. the food was was of top notch: baked brie with onion jam...hands down the best item there. the bread is perfectly toasted, the brie is gooey, the onion jam is flavored so amazing that i am still tasting it. deviled eggs with black tobiko caviar quite tasty, fried chix skin- this one was quite tasty, my girlfriend and i were asking the chef what that dish was and he said it was fried chix skin, he told one of his cooks to give us a few pieces so we could try it, needless to say 10 secs later we ordered one of our own. the fact the chef sent us a taste was the service i was talking about before, service you don't see very much, service i still talk about today. wbtg list was nice we tried 2 different reds and liked them both, great price range, love downtown prices...girlfriends daughter had a burger with tots and that was spot on as well. we also had the beet and goat cheese salad with pistachios, just a little s&p and oil, no dressing that overpowered the items, it was a clean dish and tasty. not a big dessert guy but the chef talked us into the bread pudding that they make out of donuts, it had a smooth texture unlike most bread puddings you see, just the right amount of cinnamon and other spices, right on the $, lastly the chef sent out brown butter bacon ice cream to my girlfriends daughter, a gesture from a truly great chef. don't miss out, go eat there, enjoy life, great price range, great experience....service was spot on as well, didn't mean to leave out waitress out, blanking on her name but she was so friendly and made us feel right at home...def will go back and have told as many ppl as i can lately....",

    "text": "Two of us went there, as we stayed at the D and walked over. We had read really good reviews online so wanted to try it out. I got the Jerk Turkey burger with tater tots. Good, big and filling. My buddy got the osso bucco. Don't get this. It was two pieces, mostly bone and fat. a LOT of fat. One piece, was so fatty they should have been embarrassed. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the food, how it was prepared and such. That was nice. We brought to the attention of the bartender and his response was, \"that's osso bucco right?\". We really didn't like his response. You get nothing with it but the osso bucco and there was nothing hardly to eat AND it was $16. But the turkey burger was good although it was $14 I believe. A gal near us at the bar got some tempura green beans that looked really good. I think those are $8. We each got a dessert. I love sweets. I got the brownie with the butter bacon ice cream. The brownie was cold and rock hard. They should microwave it warm, then add the ice cream. I would NOT get that again. And it cost $8! The glazed donut bread pudding was good though. Get that. But share with someone as one is enough for two people. Besides it cost $8 as well. But get it and share it. Oh and there are only a few tables. The smallest being for 6 people. So go in a group or be put to sit in a line of people. You won't be facing your friends.",

Everything food wise was good, the stand outs to me were our wild mushroom flatbread, macaroni and cheese entree, and glazed donut bread pudding.  Nothing else we ate was super note worthy.   As far as atmosphere goes it is a very small restaurant, chairs are high stools with no back on them, one men's and one women's bathroom, and there is limited parking (not uncommon for downtown).    I would recommend this place to friends looking to have a small short meal or friends looking for somewhere to have drinks.  If you're looking for an intimate sit down and enjoy a big dinner setting I would go somewhere else.    Ultimately I would not mind returning again if someone wanted to go here - but I wouldn't go out of my way to choose this spot.",

Kids will like the Mac and cheese. Also, good wine list. Simple with great price point. Staff was having a good time, even at 4pm.

If it gives you a sense, the carbonara was our least favorite of the 4 dishes, and it was still pretty good. Other friends think the carbonara is the best dish on the menu. Seriously, everything is great here. Bill was $41, and it was definitely too much food for the two of us. And the location is phenomenal for a night out, and there's a rooftop bar with heaters and blankets for winter. I'm sure it's great in the summer as well.  Update: have tried several other dishes since first trip. Not crazy about the bacon jam, but again, others LOVE the bacon jam, so YMMV. Still highly recommend, nothing bad to say at all. Service is great as well.",

Enjoyed the bacon jam, veal meatballs (a bit oversalted), and star of the menu was the gyro tacos.  Strong beer selection, but having options on tap is necessary as opposed to only bottled choices, particularly for a 'gastropub' type place like this.  Service was very friendly (we sat at the bar).  One service misstep that was a bit 'nickle and dime' (something very out of character for a Kerry Simon restaurant) is when we were approached and asked, unsolicitedly, if we want more baguette slices for our bacon jam (we said sure, as there was more bacon jam than bread).  The wait staff graciously brought this too us, and an undisclosed charge for this showed up on our bill.   It is a pet peeve of mine when service staff offers something nominal like this (four small baguette slices), not solicited by the customer, and charges you - if they are going to do this - they should either disclose it as an upcharge, or not offer something nominal unless it gratuitous for their customers - they need to work on this type of item - I expect a bit more out of a place of this caliber on this type of thing.",

    "text": "Went here on 3/27 and absolutely loved it! There were three of us and we ended up getting around 6 dishes. Everything we had was great: beet salad, bison sliders, deviled eggs, beef stroganoff, and scallops. We ended with the bacon jam and brie on toast, which was just fantastic, and sweet enough that it could roughly pass for dessert. The cocktails were also spot on. I would go back here in a heart beat.  The seating is sort of community-style: we were at a table that could seat about 10, so there were the 3 of us on the end, 2 folks to the right, and 4 more across the table/to our left. We ended up just talking amongst ourselves, but I could see it being the kind of place where you could chat with the other folks around and it would be a lot of fun.",

The mac and cheese unlike any other, the Sunday chicken sandwich unbelievable, and the turkey burger - outstanding.  A good selections of beers and specialty cocktails pair great with the food. The staff was attentive and extremely friendly. The General Manger, Matt brought several of the plates to our table and explained each and every one of them. If you have room for dessert, go for it...the brownie and ice cream outstanding.  The plates are meant to share, so do so!  Take the drive downtown and check it out, it's on Carson street at the corner of 6th street.  Don't let the small venue fool you, they have seating inside, outside and on the roof.",

    "text": "Dined at Carson Kitchen last night for a JEWEL (Jewish Emerging Leaders) event and I was excited it to try it out because of the reviews on yelp.  We had a large party (approx. 30 people) so we took up the majority of the upstairs patio. The weather this month in LV has been crazy so it was pretty windy and chilly! I wish they had space heaters, but who would have thought it would be 60 degrees in May in Las Vegas! I don't blame them for not being prepared.  The restaurant is super cool and trendy. Small intimate bar when you walk in and a cool patio and fire pit outside if you want some fresh air. The upstairs patio is spacious with a pretty view of the courthouse lit up at night.   Because we are a larger group, we had a fixed menu of items to try, but of course I took a peak at the regular menu. The variety of food sounds awesome and there were so many items I wanted to try. Their liquor menu is definitely unique. My husband ordered a vodka and the vodka that they suggested was a variety I have never heard before and I know my vodka!! ;) I am excited to come back and try the large variety of menu items and liquors.  We started with the tempura green beans which were a little on the cold side (probably because it was so cold outside), but I really enjoyed the aioli dipping sauce. We next tried the sliders which were very flavorful and tasty, definitely one of my more favorite items. We received the tater tots at the same time and they weren't anything special, but who am I to complain about deep-fried spuds, I'm all in!! We also tried the rainbow cauliflower which was so unique and I loved the vinegar sauce it was tossed in! The crispy chicken skins with honey was so interesting and tasty. We also tried the bacon jam which was so so unique. I probably would not order that again, but I am glad I tried it! Again, it was a tad on the cold side probably because it was so chilly outside. We also got potatoes with garlic, which if you put garlic on anything I will love it! But the BEST item we received was the bread pudding. The pudding is made with donuts from nearby and they are glazed. It was so yummy that we asked for seconds!!  The service was great and patient considering we had a large party of hungry people. I thought our server particularly was so friendly, wish I got his name! I cannot wait to try Carson Kitchen again. If you are a vegas local in search of a trendy, intimate spot with unique and interesting food and specialty liquor, go to Carson Kitchen tonight!!",

    "text": "Its been a few months since I visited Vegas but I still remember one particular place that we ate, Carson Kitchen in the Downtown Fremont Street area. The restaurant is one of many that are owned by the late Celebrity Chef Kerry Simon and it is one of the select few great meals that I have had at a well known chefs place in Vegas.  Carson kitchen is hidden away on Carson and 6th street and was so hidden that our cab driver actually had a hard time finding it and dropped us off almost two blocks away. After a few minutes walking around a rather sketchy part of town we finally noticed the name painted on a window and knew we had found the right place.  Once inside you will find a small dining area with nothing but family style seating. You will have two options...snuggle up and make some friends or go someplace else. I would suggest make some friends because you do not want to miss any of the food that is about to be placed in front of you. Everything on the menu sounds mouth watering good so it was hard to decided on just a few choices. My wife and I decided to go with three sharing plate choices and then a dessert. We started off with Bacon Jam and Grilled Baguettes, then Fried Tempura Green Beans, Fried Chicken Skins and then finished it all off with Doughnut Bread Pudding. The small size of the sharing plates did not matter as the huge flavors more then filled us up.  Like many before me, the highlight of the meal was the sweet and luxurious Bacon Jam. I was smart and ordered extra baguette bread so that none of it would go to waste. The jam was insanely smokey and sweet but with a slight kick of heat that hit the tongue right at the end. There were hunks of bacon and onion laced throughout it and it was capped off with creamy Brie Cheese. Unbelievably decadent and good. Nothing after that could really compare to the bacon jam but it was all very good.  The Chicken Skins were airy and crispy with a flavor and look reminiscent of pork rinds, they were served with sweet honey for dipping. The Tempura Battered Green Beans were crispy and not at all greasy and were served with a mildly spiced red pepper jelly. I would be lying if I said I didn't dip them both in my Bacon Jam.  Dessert can best be described as sex on a plate. Doughnut Bread Pudding that was made with a fresh Honey Glazed doughnut from the bakery right next door. The sinful donuts are baked in an egg custard and then topped with a sweet spiked Bourbon and Honey sauce. The waitress actually threatened to steal the dessert leftovers from us (and judging by the look in her eye she was not kidding) so we were obliged to finish the entire plate of happiness. This was such an amazing meal that I have no choice but to give it 5 stars. It is a fitting tribute to Kerry Simon and his culinary talents.",

At 6:30, we were told the roof didn't open until 7. So again, we waited. We were unfortunately rudely informed that the roof was still not ready around 7:15 and were finally seated around 7:30. Had we known that the wait was going to be so long, we would have just eaten inside. I'm glad we did stay for the food, though! The butter burger with no cheese was amazing.

    "text": "I'm a fan because I'm a sucker for good food and good beer.  My friends from China came into town (former Las Vegans) and we were on a mission to squeeze in as many new bars, clubs, and restaurants as humanly possible into the few days they had in Vegas. Carson Kitchen was an immediate destination. To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of Simon the restaurant. But Simon the person is a pretty cool guy (met him once) and he's following me on Instagram and Twitter. Just saying. ;D  The plates are small-ish and the menu is designed w/ a social aspect as its intended to be shared. This is great for us because we believe in sharing and want to try a little of everything. Not a lot of one thing. One of my friends is Jewish so we didn't try anything bacon. There are a lot of kosher items on the menu--in case its worth mentioning. We went with the following:  -Tempura Green Beans ($8): Delicious. Fresh green beans battered then deep fried. How could this possibly be a bad choice. Cream cheese dip was tasty however it could have been served softer/room-temp. It was a little difficult to dip the beans w/o breaking.  -Broccoli Crunch: ($10): Crunchy (but not too crunchy) broccoli in a green goddess sauce. This is delicious and done really well. Refreshing and the perfect pair w/ the rest of the heavy menu. -Baked Mac & Cheese ($12): Again, a classic that can't go wrong. Noodles aren't mushy. Cheese is rich and has the perfect texture.  -Short Rib Sliders ($14): The only thing we didn't like! The bun is good; I have to give them that. But the short rib root beer glaze is so sweet it kind of spoiled the slider for us. It's TOO SWEET and rather unpleasant. We ate it but wouldn't order it again. -Wild Mushroom Flat Bread ($10): Another delicious option. Lots of mushrooms, carmelized onions, and crumbled bleu cheese. These are perfect for sharing. Next time I want to try the spicy sausage one.   3 people + all that food + 3 beers was plenty for us. I think I spent around $90 + tip. Not bad and definitely a place worthy of entertaining guests. This is the perfect spot for a GNO or FNO. Get a few people together, kick back and chill while you get small bites + a few beers/cocktails (full bar). I'll be back!",

    "text": "Carson, singular...as in it is located on Carson Avenue (despite the address being 124 South Sixth). Are we supposed to hunt for this mystery location?  Yes, it is 100% worth it.  I've been holding off on my review until after my fourth visit in order to keep the naysayers from claiming I am too much of a downtown fanboi.  Over the course of my four meals at Carson Kitchen I have been able to sample a very good portion of the menu and have had the pleasure of being served by different staff each time.  Highlights of the Menu: Wellington empanada, two slightly crispy puffs of hot damn goodness stuffed with some well prepared steak.  Gyro tacos, just like your favorite Greek gyro, but better because you can pop them in your mouth.  Jerk turkey burger, this is one of my favorites and I am traditionally not a burger fan whether it be beef or turkey; the secret is the apple sauce in the recipe.  Short rib sliders; I've been soda free since '93 but damn you Simon (DAMN You!) you slipped in some root beer into the sauce and I love them!  Fried green tomato with lump crab; a big tomato filled with real crab meat, what's not to love?  Cocoa espresso NY strip steak; I had this during my last visit and paired it with their tots (everyone is doing tots these days), Carson Kitchen just happens to be doing it really well.  The steak was ordered medium, cooked to the exact temperature and tasted fantastic.  Rainbow cauliflower, who would have thought that it came in multiple colours...all three tasted good, and the same; who knows maybe they used food colouring.  Spicy sausage flat bread; wasn't all that spicy but was well received as an appetizer.  Dessert? Glazed doughnut bread pudding is amazing.  I hear they have other desserts but have not been able to forgo ordering the bread pudding each time.  Fancy cocktails:  I'm sure they have them, the bartender is constantly shaking something up; I've had a real man's drink each time, beer.  Service:  Excellent all four visits; from both the wait staff and the bar staff.  They know the menu well, they engage the patron at the appropriate times and leave you alone to enjoy your meal and company.  Perfect.  Minus 1 star:  Oh no he didn't!  The interior dining room is small and will get quite loud when busy.  Loud restaurants get on my nerves...being all old and crotchety these days.  Not enough private tables; the majority of the seating is shared tables with other guests and bar top space.  Being that the space is small I suppose they had to weigh out the negatives of seating in this arrangement but you get the feeling that most patrons do not enjoy this type of situation...maybe it's because I've been known to help myself to their plates if something looks appealing.  Secret space:  Not anymore; there is a decent sized roof top patio with more seating and another bar.  The space up there is actually about the same square footage as the lower portion.  There isn't much of a view since you're only about 12' up but at least you're outside and not looking at a parking lot.  Well done in this regard.  Final thought: Go.",

We had a large group so I had called for a reservation about 2 weeks in advance which was a good thing because the place was pretty small. It was small but it was cool and industrial yet cozy looking. Our server was really nice and we felt really welcomed.  We ordered all the social plates which consists of the crispy chicken skins,  bacon jam, devil's eggs, tempura green beans, wellington empanada,  gyro tacos, veal meatballs and walnut shrimps. We also ordered short rib sliders and wild mushrooms flat breads. The walnut shrimps were okay but everything else was delicious.  Loved loved the bacon jam. I would definitely go back and would recommend this place to anyone.   So yummy.",

But then he kept asking if we wanted to try different drinks.  One drink had beer in it, and I told him I detested beer.  He made it for me anyway, and of course I didn't like it.  When I received my bill, the drink was on that bill, along with some shots that he made us that we did not ask for!   The 2nd time I went, we waited for over an hour for a table, and I couldn't even get a bartender's attention to get me a drink.  We ended up leaving without eating.",

    "text": "After this evening I would actually give this place a negative rating if possible! So here is what happen, after waiting more then an hour for our table were ed, pretty stoked to be seated and enjoyed our waiters. After a min or two my wife noticed a huge amount of hair in her water, literally a huge amount of it almost looked like a dreadlock I mean you could have made a freaking carpet out of the amount of hair in her glass. So naturally I told our waitress, she directly got the manager. The manager didn't even really try to apologize his words exact words were, \"I'll get you guys a desert or something\" the thing he gave us was the cheapest and most greasiest appetizer on the menu (fried chicken skin). You would think, after that happened a manager would try to make sure we had a good evening and would check on us frequently, but no (they even charged us $1 for the extra bread). When we paid he was no where to be found. We were charged the full amount!  To be honest this is the first review I have ever written here and this is only because I am freaking mad at this place and the so called manager person. We saw him on the street when we walked out and instead of saying anything he looked on the ground and walked pass us and pretended he didn't know us. The sad part is we used to really like this place but after what happen today this place is dead to us. My whole life I grew up in restaurants, point being I know service and this is the first time in my life I have never tipped.",

    "text": "The pictures for this place looked amazing, they were mouth-watering.  We waited an hour for a table, which isn't that bad considering it was Saturday night so you can't be mad about that. One annoying part though was that they had plenty of open tables on their patio but they don't let you sit in them even if you've ordered drinks from the bar. You must stand at the bar or wander around the courtyard. The bussers would jump on different parties the instant they sat down with their drinks, claiming the tables were for parties being seated... the problem is parties were never seated in those tables.   The food looked amazing in person as well. The problem was that everything was very heavy handed. The bacon jam was great for the first bite or two but just had so much pepper and spice that it was overwhelming and you couldn't even taste the bacon. The deviled eggs were pretty good. The mac and cheese was DRENCHED in truffle oil. I can still taste it a week later. We absolutely love mac and cheese, even when it's not that good it's still pretty good (kinda like pizza), but they had so much truffle oil on this stuff that it was gross and inedible. The pesto flatbread was pretty boring and uneventful, also unfulfilling. The lamb was good.  Pros: Drinks were strong, everyone was friendly, food came out in a fairly timely manner.  Cons: Food wasn't very good. Tons of open tables with no parties being sat and can't sit in bar area even though you're drinking. Everything was pretty pricey for \"tapas\" style small plates. I don't mind paying a premium for good stuff, but not for heavy handed, over seasoned stuff.  We probably won't be eating here again, too many other places to try.",

We walked from Fremont street area and for a little bit thought it was a joke as the area was rather shady.  And then there it was!    An obviously hipster hole in the wall with amazing food and unbeatable value! I was joined by a couple of food snobs and they couldn't believe how good it was.   I got the pork Ossobucco.  Very little fat and I could pull it apart with a fork.  Incredible flavor.  Others got the NY strip which was very tender and cooked perfectly.  The sides are shareable sized so we got the broccoli crunch, rissoto, and Mac &  cheese ....all incredible.  Definitely a very small place that maybe sits 40 people but nicely designed.  We just walked right in and got a table but I think we got lucky.  Looking forward to going back!",

Somehow it worked. I ordered the Butter Burger, and it was cooked medium well as I requested.

They also have an interesting bacon ice cream fudge brownie dessert which is well worth a shot!  Service here was awesome and quick. They're all friendly and believers of their food too. \"Everything's on the menu is good.\" Was what we were told and so far that's been True!  They don't take reservations but just give them a call 30 mins before arrival and they can pop ya on the wait list and  hold a table for you too :)  Overall I'd recommend this to both couples and groups of friends.",

Finding it was a bit of a challenge - if you go to the address given, you will NOT find it...it's around on the side of the building.    We did figure it out, and immediately saw two things: - the place was PACKED - the place was also smallish But, we were told to go check out the bar, and we'd have a table \"in a bit\".  So we ordered some drinks and chatted - turns out \"in a bit\" was about 10 minutes - so not bad for a group of seven.  We got to our table (quite rustic), and checked out the menu.  Here's where it got REALLY interesting really fast.  When you order something...anything - it's served family style.  Steak, potatoes, calamari, whatever...it gets sliced up and put on the table for all to enjoy.  Definitely a bit different, but it meant we could explore - and explore we did.  I think we ended up with one order of everything on the menu.   And ignoring the fru-fru stuff (colored cauliflower?  Ugh) it was all quite delish - prepared perfectly.  I don't think a single plate was left with anything on it.  If you're in Old Vegas, definitely worth checking out.  Good fresh food, unique, good service.",

The downside to this place is the face that it is farther our from the strip, which requires you to go out by taxi. Unless you're aiming for Fremont Street then it would be fine. However, Fremont Street was a bummer so we ended up getting food here even though we weren't that hungry. It was still a bit of a trek to get here from the main street.  I still like the options and how it is one of those unique places to have that spicy cocktail or like I mentioned oxtail risottos. The filet ohhhhh fish was actually pretty good. It was one of the normal items, but it was a safe choice if you're not the adventurous type.  The ambiance is definitely a casual setting. The best way is to get here around 6, eat, go to the nearby bars and enjoy life like you're in Vegas late into the night.",

    "text": "Fine dining in an eclectic, industrial \"hip-style\" restaurant! The wait staff work in \"rock and roll\" t-shirts, and the managers dress casual biz casual. We came back for a second night, based upon our experience on night one. You could blindfold yourself, point to anything on the menu and be dazzled and amazed by theingredient combination, quality and presentation. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a five star restaurant! The food, service and atmosphere are an experience to behold!   Start your night with a selection from the \"shaken and stirred\" bar menu, you can't go wrong. The same thought and planning that goes into the food pairings also happens at the bar.  Food wise, we tried the gyro tacos, followed by the poached pear and bleu salad, young beets, baked mac & cheese coupled with the Salmon and Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip. Long story short, all dishes prepared with excruciating attention to detail, a taste sensation, and the seared crusting on the NY Strip was to die for! We topped it all off with the bourbon fudge brownie with brown butter bacon ice cream! Wow!   Night two: We feasted on the charred octopus, followed by the devils eggs as appetizers. We then made our way through the broccoli crunch and wild mushroom flatbread. I can honestly tell you that everything was exceptional. The planning they put into their menu is outstanding, and the parings are exceptional!  Sit at the bar, where you can watch the food being prepared, and witness the amazing choreography of the entire staff; it is a sight to behold and a model of teamwork and efficiency. Special thanks to our waitress, Bridget, and managers Ethan and Arnold for their wonderful service.",

Already one of the best restaurants this end of the strip, I am happy to see Carson Kitchen pushing the envelope with HUGE flavors, unique dishes and melodious concoctions coming together oh so well.  A few highly mentionable dishes to note :  Smoked Trout Rillette : Pickled Mustard Seed, Charred Bread. Wow, such bold flavors coming together in harmony with a pistou melody on top...Highly recommended! Something that most would avoid given the ingredients, this is one NOT to be missed!  Pork Chop : Rhubarb Chutney & Apple Butter Mustard. Apple Butter Mustard...yes! A sweet, salt and vinegar symphony working perfectly :)  Calabrian Flatbread : 'Nduja, Cup & Char Pepperoni, Mozzarella. Andoille spice and heat, bold flavors that work so well...one of my favorites here!  Glad to see they aren't getting comfortable here...always pushing the envelope! You can taste the LOVE with each bite ;)  Enjoy!",

We got a cool seat at the bar area and watched the whole brigade make meals and desserts it was nice. We started out with the crispy chicken skins it was very good, a very light, and guilty dish to have. The honey dipping sauce was just right too.  The menu has so much to offer as well, I had the Secret Sunday Chicken and it was a magnificent sandwich.  This is a definitely the place to get a beer and some chicken.  My wife got the Mac and cheese and she fell in love again lol.  We finished off the night with the donut bread pudding.. and wow that was delicious.  From watching the chefs prepare the desserts this one was definitely necessary to order.  This is a great date night spot away from the strip and was a definitely a treat for a couple of tourist.",

It is located in a nondescript, downtown building that is about a block away from Container Park. It is small and lively, and a welcome change from the big box, glitzy Vegas spots.  The restaurant recently reopened after a two week renovation/remodel. We were lucky to be seated at the end of the large, granite kitchen table. It was an awesome spot because we had a front row seat to the cooking action. It was like being in the MasterChef kitchen (minus Chef Ramey's attitude), and I was impressed with how well the staff worked together.  Our party of four shared a number of appetizers. Our favorites were the Gyro Tacos and Tempura Green Beans. I ordered the New Your Strip, and I thought it was excellent. Everything that came out the kitchen was presented nicely and looked very appetizing. The staff was helpful and friendly. Overall a wonderful experience, and I definitely recommend.",

The chicken battered with a little heat and cooked tender and delicious on a grilled bun. Tots spicy and non greasy. A nice find away from the glitz and chaos of the strip.

We had the shrimp, a plate of flatbread, mushrooms, some salad, several other shared plates.  Not a lot of food on each, but everything tasted fantastic.",

    "text": "I am not sure how to describe this place. It is under Yelp as \"America, Comfort Food.\" There's touches of fusion in there. Either way, their executive chef has got some neat ideas in that mind. Everything was good, we got the strawberry salad, crab fondue, espresso steak, chicken thighs, macaroni & cheese, tempura green beans, and burger. Nothing really disappointed. I did wish the crab fondue just came with bread but I can see how some would desire a textural contrast. For myself I prefer just the bread. Proteins were well seasoned. The fondue was a little salty but ... it's cheese what are you expecting? Just use more bread to cheese ratio and you're good. The small joint could get a little loud but the staff was super friendly. Drop by Downtown so you could give this place a try.",

Since we were told it was intended that we share meals, we thought we would be getting somewhat small portions, but that wasn't the case at all (good thing.)   As for the food we ordered:  -Cuban sandwich - phenomenal. I am thinking about it right now. The bread was crispy and flavorful, pork belly was juicy in the perfect amount. I always like mustard and pickles (separately) but recently have very much been craving them and this definitely hit the spot.  -Scallops - flavor was very good but the one I got (we shared, came with three) was a little cold (sad face) but, it was super delicious. The other two were apparently good temperature.  -Bacon Jam - I don't know how to describe this flavor but you have to try it. It's savory and sweet (best combo ever?) and comes with more than you would expect.  -Mac and cheese - barely got to taste this because we were so full but, it was really yummy. It was the last thing we got, so by then, we were uncertain of how much we could eat, but we could just smell how delicious it would taste so we had to. I think my bf intended to put the leftover bacon jam on the leftover mac and cheese - I can't even imagine.... :-o  Can't wait to come back here. The only thing is that I would have to remember to bring a jacket because they keep it SUUUUUPER cold in here! Hopefully next time we could try out the patio upstairs, too.",

Don't bring the kiddos!!!!! The menu is diverse with craft beers and such and a SWEAR JAR......didn't hear anybody needing it, alas there was $$ in it.    Started with the deviled eggs (4per order) were deeeelish. The crispest bacon pieces I've EVER tasted w/o being burnt. Smooth taste not over seasoned, just FAB! The beet salad looked incredible (pix included) on the plate, 2 different colors, goat cheese w Honey he practically licked the plate clean.      Also ordered the burger...which was quite  good, slightly undercooked for me however it did have good flavor. The chicken breast sandwich was also good, fried crispy perfection both had excellent sauce.     The place isn't BIG, great atmosphere, nice bar and we were greeted warmly by everyone there ~ A FUN  PLACE!!     Also inc pics of the deviled eggs with bacon, caviar & micro greens + the beet salad with goat cheese & honey~",

We first ordered our drinks which is usually an IPA beer. I got the bacon jam and OMG this was soooo amazing. I've never tried something like this and when you first get the dish it almost looks like burnt brownie in a skillet served with bread lol. So I scooped some bacon jam on a piece of bread and tried it. DELISH!   We ordered other things as well like the tempura green beans I believe and those were good but I think the sauce along with the beans actually made that dish. If it wasn't for the sauce then it'll be just tempura beans..   Mac&cheese! Wow! Wow! Wow! It was DELISH as well.. The different types of cheese just makes your palate dance for joy! Lol..  In the end this place was on point and I'll be back again but if you only wanna order two things get the mac&cheese and the bacon jam, you won't be disappointed.",

Cauliflower - garlic & lemon juice, not too hard to ruin Beets - was decent, nothing special. I would expect the veggies to be nice and cold and refreshing The oxtail risotto - STICKY and THICK mess.

Our server was great, their mixed drinks were great (at one point I ordered Jameson on the rocks and I was given the option to add an extra 1.5oz for an extra $3, not sure what other drinks that goes for, but I'm sure the server will inform you if it is an option), last but not least the food was amazing!!   I would highly recommend the following:  - Gyro Tacos which comes with lamb meat, but it probably will not be everyone's cup of tea for those who like to steer away from meat that tastes too gamey. - Veal Meatballs is topped with Foie Gras cream, need I say more?  - Bacon Jam & Brie - The bacon jam comes sizzling hot with a melted slab of brie cheese on top, served with toasted bread.  - Fried Chicken Skin with Honey Dip - each piece is crisp to perfection, my friend had one order all to herself.  - Butter Burger with a side of Tater Tots - flavor packed between two soft buns.    Other things that were ordered that is worth trying:  - Smashed Potatoes - It's not mashed pototoes, it a baked potato sliced into 2-3 pieces with sour cream and chives on top. - Tempura Green Beans - A great appetizer to munch on. - NY Strip Steak - we ordered medium rare and the outcome was exactly like so, and very tender.   Will definitely be paying Carson Kitchen another visit in the future when I'm in Las Vegas again.",

    "text": "Got to LV late last night and was starving. As we  approach our landing, Fremont Street, I got on Yelp to see if there were any gems in the area. Carson Kitchen is amazing.  I've recently become fond of Gin and had The Margarian and it was delicious, definitely on the sweet side for a cocktail. My partner had the Laguinitas little sumpin sumpin ale and it was great.  All the plates here are sharable which I love because as a visitor I want to try as much as possible.   We had the Crispy Chicken Skins which come with honey as a dipping sauce. I am not a big Salt eater so they were delicious but I got tired of the flavor after a few, I do believe they are a hit for most. We also had the NY Strip which hand a rub that included coffee and a red wine demi glaze. It was tasty, ordered it medium rare but was more on the rare side.   Now for the stars of the show. First, the jalapeno poppers stuffed with a sausage and cream cheese filling, the best of my life. Finally, the pork osso bucco, this last one was my partner's pick and it was absolutely amazing. Extremely tender, well seasoned, and served on an very light yet flavorful gravy. The best meal I've had in Vegas one of the best in my life.",

    "text": "My husband and I aren't foodies - and this seems like foodie food. We were not intimidated though. Nothing seemed pretentious. A good vibe all around.   I got the NY Strip. It was one of the best steaks I've ever had and the price was great. Didn't catch any cocoa-espresso flavor though. The size of the serving was generous. I asked for medium and got medium. The flavor on the outside was mouth-watering. Seriously!  I also got asparagus but it wasn't what I was expecting. I was hoping for grilled asparagus but this was really a salad with a little lettuce, bite-size asparagus pieces, and some really yummy pickled onions, and huge croutons that were really good. And the dressing was great.   My husband got Mac n cheese and he said it was better than my aunt's (which we always use as a measuring tool). I agree. It was really good. You can tell the cheese was fancy. Since they encourage you to get a lot of dishes and share, it could be fun for people who have extensive tastes. My husband doesn't eat red meat and doesn't like asparagus so sharing wasn't really our plan and his serving of Mac and cheese was smaller than what he was hoping for so I didn't want to eat more than a bite. But still, it was awesome and I want to go back next time I'm in town.   Oh - The place is tiny and can get crowded. But we came without reservations at 6:30 on a friday evening and were seated within 5 minutes.   The waiter was friendly and food came out quick.   We are used to ordering soda at restaurants because we don't drink booze. They only have fancy sodas in bottles so no refills. We should be cutting back anyway. I wasn't too excited about the one I got (dr. Better).",

I don't remember what we had anymore but all the cocktails and food were absolutely delicious. We left incredibly full and the quality was much higher than if we had spent it on Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon. The price would have been about the same per person.

The items we had were:  Crispy Chicken Skins - Had a flavor similar to Five Guys Cajun Fries....was expecting something different but was more like to one of the grain crackers you get from Trader Joes....  Bacon Jam - A little bit too salty but was executed very well....  Bison Meatloaf Sliders - One of my favorite items we had. Excellent...only thing I may change would be the bread as it was very rich and filling. The flavor was there and the meat was right on.  Rainbow Cauliflower - Don't really fuck with cauliflower unless its (beer/tempura battered) but said fuck it why not and ordered this. This dish was excellent. Simple with flavors from the lemon juice and garlic. The burnt crispies of the garlic and the texture of the white broccoli were right on.  Baked Mac & Cheese - God damn this was rich in flavor. Very good and of course you can't go wrong with truffle oil as well....  Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak - For some reason I was expecting more of a sweeter bitter flavor or like a mole esque type of sauce but it ended up tasting more like curry or cumin...The steak was done perfect as medium..  Glazed Donut Bread Pudding - This dish is to share for about 4 people....a twist on the regular donut...just wished it was a little bit wetter...  The overall experience was a very positive one. They pride themselves as close to perfection as possible as they would not serve certain items on the menu that I wanted because they weren't prepared correctly....This place has potential through the roof and as their menu changes every 2-3 months it will for sure can tons of repeating foodies...me myself one of them",

I had bar seating at the very end, which was fine by me as I was alone. I ordered The Margarian and it was soooo delicious!  With lots of advice about the menu from the extra handsome guy behind the bar, I decided on ordering the Filet O Fish sandwich. They came out with the wrong order, a chicken sandwich, which caused me to have to wait a few more min for my food. It didn't kill the moment though, I kept myself busy with a second drink. Yas. It was that good. The sandwich was OK it felt like it was miss the tangy/tart element. The tater tots that came with it were perfect. I asked to have bit of the spicy pickle aioli, because I had heard it mentioned twice while I was there so I was curious. It was pretty tasty and a good compliment to the fish sandwich but not what I felt was missing. I loved the feel of Carson Kitchen. Food a bit of a miss. Drinks were perfection.",

As someone that is new to Las Vegas it is great to be able to find a place that afford a great meal and atmosphere without the insane prices of the Vegas Strip.    There are several things to live about Carson Kitchen but the first thing to come to mind is the fried chicken skins.  Perfectly fried with a side of honey,  the fried chicken skins are a great start to any meal (other solid choices are the cauliflower or green tempura). For a main course there are several great choices but I personally have enjoyed all the burgers they have to offer. To end your meal you can't go wrong with choosing the glazed donut b bread pudding.   Carson Kitchen has gained a loyal and satisfied customer for a long time.",

    "text": "In the past 6 months, downtown Las Vegas has been booming. The latest buzz happens to be the John E. Carson building on Carson and 6th Ave. This converted hotel now houses some of the coolest, most innovative business downtown like Bud & Vine, Grass Roots and O Face Doughnuts. For this review, I wanted to visit a restaurant who's food and drinks have been the center of conversation at work. I'm talking about Kerry Simon's Carson Kitchen.   What drew me to the joint was the innovative spin on modern classics. Recommendations seem to pour my way about the food and drinks offered. Approaching the joint, you'll notice the restaurant name etched into the windows. Enter the place and you'll quickly realize the dramatic spin Carson Kitchen hosts. The lighting was more on the intimate side, however, large windows offered more natural light during my early dinner visit. What I can say is this place offers a very eclectic feel. You have butcher block wooden table tops and bar tops, out of the box lighting fixtures shaped like jars and what seemed like a wheel of Swiss cheese and twisted metal separators from the bar and dining area, giving the illusion of streamers.   For this visit, a friend and I decided to sit at the bar to order some cocktails and light bites. Our bartender this evening was Stephanie and the bar back, Danny. Stephanie to me, is the epitome of customer service. She took the time to get to know us from the moment we sat down. She was personable, humorous and gave us some amazing recommendations when solicited.  Stephanie recommended a couple of drinks to try that evening. Both recommendations came from the popularity of her customers. Here's what I got:   The Magarian for $10. Aviation gin, thyme and honey syrup, fresh lemon, Mr. Q Cumber soda and garnished with a cucumber slice and sprigs of thyme. It was clean and super refreshing. Ever flavor was prominent and really stood out on its own, yet came together very nicely. To me, the gin and lemon flavors married well and there was a refreshing thyme and cucumber finish.  The Town's End for $11. Slow and Low whiskey, Fernet Vittone, Amaro del Sole, Regan's bitters #6 and Angostura bitters. This drink is True strong sipper. It gives off the vibe of a \"gentleman's cocktail,\" although great for all sexes, or a porch drink enjoyed on southern summer afternoon. What this drink is know for is the big spherical shaped ice that fills the glass. The whiskey and Fernet make for a deep, rich flavor and the bitters bring an elegant bite. I love how the whiskey was the True star of the show, however, the earthiness of the Fernet peaks through at some point and ends on a sweet note. Definitely a great drink to try!  Trust me, you do NOT want to stop there. While you're here, you should definitely take advantage of their food. After all, they are first a foremost, a restaurant. To go along with out wonderful cocktails, we also decided to order a few \"Social Plates\" from the menu. We got the:  Bacon Jam for $12. Bacon jam topped with Brie cheese and served with toasted baguette. The smokiness of the bacon and sweetness of the jam worked harmoniously. Top it with the creaminess of the Brie and you've got a perfect topping for the crunchy baguette. Really a great dish!   Tempura Green Beans for $6. Served with pepper jelly and cream cheese. I was told this was life changing. And it was. The pepper jelly and cream cheese combo brought me back to my younger years, eating it with Ritz crackers. Today, I was taken to an even better place with the crunchy and fresh taste of the tempura batter and green beans. Such a great combination. I HIGHLY recommend this.  Gyro Tacos for $10. Lamb, Tzatziki sauce, cucumber, tomatoes, cilantro and feta. This dish has a strong Mediterranean presence. The lamb was seasoned well and the Tzatziki sauce married the meat, tomatoes and cucumbers quite nicely.   Spicy Mushroom flatbread for $12. Spicy sausage, homemade ricotta, broccoli and fennel. Probably the best part of the meal for me. A super savory dish with lots of sausage and caraway seeds. It wasn't too spicy and allowed you to enjoy the flavors. The broccoli, although not common on flatbreads, really brought a nice clean texture to the mix, along with the fennel. I really loved this dish and know you will too!  The one question I kept asking myself was why I haven't visited sooner. This place is exactly what the downtown scene needs. It's fun, full of personality and offers yet another great option for diners and drinkers alike. I can see this place appealing to the masses of folks looking to catch up with old friends or meeting that blind date for nice evening. Overall, this place definitely has a good social vibe and was made for the intent of Downtown Las Vegas: the intent of collisions.",

We also had the deviled eggs which had bacon bits & caviar, and the fried chicken skins. If you've had Mexican style chicharrones that is how the chicken skins are. I forgot the name of the shrimp (oops).   Its a social atmosphere. Good for a first date!   Definitely give it a try!!!",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Carson Kitchen due to the rave reviews on Yelp. Sadly, for me, I was left disappointed but maybe because I was expecting too much. We ordered the oxtail risotto, fried chicken skins, sirloin, and of course, the hyped up bacon jam with brie. The most disappointing dish had to be the oxtail risotto. We love oxtail and were disappointed by the lack of flavor in the dish along with a small amount of oxtail. The rice was a little undercooked too. The bacon jam was good but nothing to write home about.   Looking back, it was truly a disappointing experience for us because we expected much more based on everything we read on Yelp. We probably won't be visiting again during our next Vegas trip.",

    "text": "Today was my first visit to Carson Kitchen. The waitstaff was excellent, but the food was just A-OK. As my rating indicates, nothing was terrible but also nothing was truly outstanding.  Two of us ordered crispy fried chicken skin, shepherd pie, roasted beets, and wild mushroom flatbread. The fried chicken skin seemed a little on the burnt side of fried. The roasted beets were well seasoned and tasty with crumbled blue cheese but were unevenly cooked with some pieces undercooked and crunchy, and some perfectly cooked. And the mushroom flatbread should be called vegetable flatbread since there were other veggies (asparagus and broccoli) in equal parts to the mushrooms; this overall was a little bland and could use some kind of seasoning, maybe some garlic or spices. I had high hopes based on others' reviews but don't share the enthusiasm after my visit.",

    "text": "This was a big disappointment. We were seated at the bar without being asked when tables were open. The bartender who was our waiter wasn't friendly. When asked questions about the menu the bartender/waiter have smartass answers. We ordered two entrees, both of which had been 86'd because of a new menu coming out next week. That would have been good to know before looking over the menu. We ordered substitute entrees, one of which was also 86'd.  Since they have paper menus it would be very easy to cross out the items that are no longer available if the staff isn't going to tell customers. Our entrees (steak) came out cool, not warm, and the cauliflower side was no where to be seen. We asked about it and the bartender checked with a nearby server who we overheard say that it wasn't put in. The bartender then told us it would just be a minute more because he was just told it hadn't been made. We ate half of our steaks and then waiting for the cauliflower. Our steaks just got colder as we waited. At no point was there an apology or a visit from a manager. The only reason this is getting two stars instead of lower is the quality of the food. I can't recommend this place and won't be back.",

Actually it turned out to be not even 10 minutes and they sat me at the bar.  All I can say is my date was amazing and thanks to the impeccable service of Tara.  She made sure I was ok until my date arrived.  When he did she was attentive without being intrusive, sweet, helped make suggestions, and overall made the night such a great experience that this will be my go to spot in Las Vegas.  Could not rave more about the Bacon Jam.  SUPERB!!  A night to remember in more ways than one and thanks to the excellent service from Tara.  Cheers to Carson Kitchen.",

    "text": "This is the problem with the 'new downtown.' The attitude of these new business owners is abhorrent. They come here to Vegas, full of pompous flatulence. They believe that since they are \"new and hip,\" that the general public should bend over and keep their mouth shut.  Yes, you did invite me to go into further detail. However, unlike you, (whom I was well aware of your presence while we dined because you sat right behind us), I have my own business to run.I also advised you that as soon as I had a chance I would be more than happy to discuss. I was there only 2 days ago.   I am a Vegas native, born and raised. In fact, my family opened one of the first ethnic restaurants here in the late 50's. I grew up working there so I know a little about the food industry.  So, here are the issues in greater detail.  We arrived at approximately 13:45. We were a party of 6. Upon stepping in, we were greeted with several looks of disdain. The \"what the hell do these people want\" look of disdain. However, the subsequent customers that walked in were greeted with smiles. I guess I should have come in my skinny jeans and plaid shirt.  Once we were greeted by your hostess, we had requested the table in the corner to avoid the sun. We were told that that table was unavailable. (Come to find out it was unavailable because you were going to sit there).   We sat down at the table directly behind the hostess stand. The waitress did not come greet us until approximately 5 minutes after we sat down. At which time she asked us if we were ready to order. We stated not yet as we just had  sat down. She took our  drink order ( Three waters, no ice. Three waters with ice with lemons. One cup of coffee and an iced tea.   She returned with four glasses of water, two with and two without ice. No lemons. Coffee and iced tea were delivered (without accompaniments) She asked again whether we were ready to order again. To which we stated we would like more time. Her face expression at that moment was best described as utter contempt. Then she just stood there at the table with that same look which she shared with another staff member as they walked by.  To attempt on getting her to not stand there, my colleague and sister both asked the waitress (Paige-according to my bill) for sweetener for my father's iced tea and cream for my aunt's coffee. To which she replied, \"sweetener? Oh yeah, we have that.\" Then it took a good three seconds for her to physically react. As she reached for the sweetener caddy, she remarked, \"oh, we have syrup too.\" She proceeded to as your bartender for the syrup where I overheard her ask for the 'simple syrup.' My sister said, \"oh, that's nice but is it Agave syrup, because my dad is diabetic.\" Waitress handed the syrup to my sister stammering something about ,\" yeah it is... it's syrup... yeah it's  AH GAH BAY... uh yeah it's mixed in there. \" My sister inspected it and it appeared to be simple syrup. Coupled with the waitress' response, I told my sister not to give it to my dad and to not trust her statement.  Then we indicated we were ready to order. We ordered the broccoli crunch, gyro tacos, deviled eggs and the chicken skins. She asked us if we were ready to oder our entrees to which we replied, \"yes.\"  My dad ordered the Chicken Thighs. My sister added three more orders of the Thighs to cover my aunt, colleague, and mother. My sister proceeded to ask about the oxtail risotto about what it's like. Waitress responded, \"it's good...\" as though she wasn't so sure herself. At that point, supervisor,? manager? walked over to waitress and whispered something to her. She then in turn stated, almost accusatorially, \"the manager just told me we are out of the chicken thighs.\"  oh ok.  \"What else do you want to order?\" To which we all said, \"since there are no thighs, we would like a few more moments to look at our options.\" She huffed and walked away. She proceeded to step away and stand at the hostess table occasionally glaring back at the table as if we had done something wrong.   Once our food order was placed, you and your colleagues sat behind us. Your food arrived very quickly. Ours didn't. As I stated in the prior review, one bite of Chicken Skins told me that the lack of proper flavoring was compensated by immersion of MSG.   The risotto was a gloppy tasteless mess. My dad stated,\" they must've just waved the oxtail over this mess. I can't taste anything that resembles oxtail in it.\"  The deviled eggs were runny and small. The butter burger had no real flavor but for the fancy cheese that was on it. The flatbreads were average in flavor and taste.   The short rib sliders were overcooked and very small.   At no time did our waitress come to check on us after the food was delivered nor were our drinks refilled.   I wrote the prior review as I sat there and watched you and your staff react to it. Only problem was that nothing was done for your diners that were there.  'Thoughtful' enough for you?",

    "text": "Wow, second time having dinner here and I regret I didn't give them a 5 star on the first. It's super small so go early or be prepared to wait but it's worth it. I've been a senior marketing executive at the biggest casino resort on the strip. I've eaten in every celebrity chef restaurant in Vegas. This is one of my favorite restaurants, period. From the hyper creative menu, chicken skins, Devils eggs, etc. to the very good boutique service. This restaurant is legit. Actually I shouldn't write this good of a review because it will get crazy popular, as if it's not already popular. Let's make these people famous so they will open more restaurants like this one. Awesome place.",

You get to taste a little bit of everything then! This visit we had the roasted beet salad, the Thai chicken flatbread and the gyro tacos. All were just divine! The waitress warned us that the flatbread was spicy - honestly, it had the tiniest kick, definitely not on the 'they needed to be warned about the level of spicy' list. We like spicy food, and were mildly disappointed that she made it sound a little more than it was. We always finish our meal with the glazed donut bread pudding. It. Is. To. Die. For. Fat kids dream, making the 'O' face, death row last meal kind of amazing. I would swim in that bread pudding if I could. The service is always spot on, the drinks are stiff, tasty, and reasonably priced. I will continue to go back and recommend this place to all of my friends!!",

Glad I had read on a review that there was no sign out side, at least we knew what to look for.  Staff was friendly and I really liked the decor and vibe of the place.  He was not a fan of the communal seating, especially with the two elderly gentleman and their escorts attempting to carry on conversations. Ordered a round of drinks and ordered the short rib sliders with tater tots and the mac and cheese (which the server proclaimed was \"LIFE CHANGING-you have to have it \". Place was freezing so the wait seemed to be longer than it probably was. a chef and maybe a manager were arguing with the bartender about her ringing an order up incorrectly , fine I get it but really in front of the guests?  Sliders looked good, mac and cheese looked good. He grabbed a slider and one bite he was done. The braising in rootbeer is great, but there is NOTHING on the thing to counteract the sweetness. The tater tots were way way overcooked to the point there was no white in the middle. The mac and cheese while decent, was no where near \"life changing\" I spent years in DC if you want life changing mac and cheese go to Cafe Delux in DC. he had been excited to try the bourbon brownie. But instead we left most of the sliders, half the mac and cheese and two half full drinks and went elsewhere for drinks and dessert.",

So if you have those expectations, you'll like the place.    The food is pretty good, but rich.  The restaurant kinda reminds me of a gastro pub without the beer taps.  Everything I had was flavor packed and unique.  I had the black rice and oxtail risotto, fried chicken skins, bacon jam, and the watermelon feta salad.  All good, and very rich.  I think the food was giving me gout afterwards.  BTW, I shared the plates, I didn't eat all those dishes myself.  There's a patio in the back that you can wait in while you're waiting for a table.  It's open, so it was about 150 degrees out there.  I ordered a beer and took it out there, but it went warm rather quickly.  Maybe you get use to the dry heat if you live in Vegas?  They don't take reservations, but they set the waiting time expectations really well.  People seem to be willing to wait to get a spot in this place.  Try it once.  The beer and wine selection was small but well done.  I think they should add a couple more verities of beer on the menu though.",

    "text": "The wife and I went downtown specifically for a dinner at Carson Kitchen.  Carson Kitchen had been on my to-do list since opening, but we finally made it for dinner less than a week after Chef Simon had, sadly, passed away.  I'd been a fan of Chef Simon's unique take on comfort food after dining at his first restaurant at the Hard Rock back in '03, so there was a somber note to an otherwise delicious dining experience.  We arrived around 5:30 on a Thursday night.  Carson Kitchen was smaller than I expected, but it possessed a dark, modern, masculine aesthetic that looked nice.  We didn't have reservations, but coming in early allowed us to snag prime seats overlooking the kitchen.  I always enjoy being able to see the action in the kitchen.  Our seats didn't disappoint.  We didn't order drinks other than water, which was unusual for us, especially since there were several cocktails on the menu that sounded appealing.  Definitely next time.  For our meal, we shared orders of the Crispy Chicken Skins ($9), Bacon Jam ($12), and Rabbit Ragu ($14).  The Crispy Chicken Skins were exactly what you'd expect, crispy chicken skins...essentially chicken chicharron, served with smoked honey for dipping.  It was simple, delicious, and effective.  The Bacon Jam was exactly what you'd expect; smoky, savory bacon made into a jam, topped with baked Brie, and served with toasted baguette slices.  It was very close to being too salty for my personal liking, but it didn't cross the line and it was still very good.  The Rabbit Ragu wasn't what you'd likely expect unless you'd read the menu, which we did.  We received a generous amount of rabbit meat in the ragu served atop a bed of spaghetti squash, a nice change of pace over regular pasta, and topped with Parmesan.  All of our dishes were generous in its portion size given the price.  Service was friendly and attentive throughout our meal.  By all measures, Carson Kitchen was everything I'd hoped it would be. 4.5 stars.",

Because we did. We've NEVER had such amazing service at a restaurant.   We've also never had such amazing mac and cheese. If I wasn't half comatose from stuffing myself, I would write lengthy, borderline inappropriate poetry to honor Carson Kitchen's mac and cheese.  Bread pudding made from doughnuts. Are you freaking kidding me?  This place has officially been added to our must-visit list for future Vegas trips.",

    "text": "Came because of the YELP reviews for my husband's birthday. We love downtown and are always looking for new places. We were seated by the front. Immediately I was uncomfortable because of the wooden stools they used as chairs. We took two full back chairs from the next table and put the stools there. The hostess came over and told us we couldn't have those chairs because there wouldn't be enough room when they got busy. We actually sat closer to the table because they were chairs. We asked to keep the chairs and she just walked off.  Ordered some appetizers and drinks. No redbull...boo. What kind of hipster restaurant doesn't have redbull?  They did have Tito's vodka...yum.  Our server was very nice and explained how the food is served, etc. Ordered the chicken skins, not my favorite but I don't like just fried skins. Also got the green beans (YUMMY!!!!) the sauce was amazing. My husband ordered the lamb tacos and loved them. There were only 3 tacos and we were obviously sharing the dishes so the waitress asked if we would like a 4th...I thought that was nice. I did love the Mac and cheese. The rest of the food was good but not necessarily my taste. It was obvious they put great care into their menu and presentation, I appreciated that.  We had desert but only ate half of it. No one really liked the bacon ice cream except me. The bread pudding was yummy.  Overall it was a good experience. I liked the atmosphere and the whole feeling. Not sure I'd go back but only because the menu wasn't my preference.",

My boyfriend works downtown and suggested this place since it was close to his work.  Definitely a trendy, hipster place.  The waitresses were dressed in jeans and various music group T-shirts.  We were immediately seated by Chelsea who was rocking a Led Zeppelin T-shirt (I liked her already!).  They have various tables and seating in a big square around the bar.  We opted to sit up at the bar.  My coffee arrived quickly and Chelsea never let it get below half full (coffee drinkers always appreciate that!).  After a few minutes exploring the menu my friend and I decided to split the gyro tacos and the bacon jam.  The tacos were perfect size with spicy lamb meat inside topped with feta cheese, traditional Greek tzatziki sauce, and tomatoes.  Yummy!  The bacon jam was a piping hot mix of bacon, cheese, and a sweet flavor infused.  It was served with crispy sliced baguette bread.  Another hit.    During lunch Carson Kitchen fills up fast.  There was a mix of casually dressed 20 somethings to middle aged business men/women.  They have a rooftop bar and an impressive libations menu as well.  Prices are a little high for lunch ($40 + tip) but justified by the quality of food and service.  Carson Kitchen nails it!",

    "text": "This is a review that I admittedly feel bad writing, as it always tugs on my heartstrings a bit to see a place fall from grace. I have dined at Carson Kitchen a total of 6 times now and had I written my review after the first two times, I would have easily given them 5/5 stars, but now that I have dined there several more times since, I feel like there is a bit of complacency that has resulted in the restaurant going downhill a bit in both its food quality, variety, and service.   Starting with the menu. Chef Kerry Simon developed the original menu and when they first opened, they discussed how the menu would change over time and that things would come and go for variety. I totally respect that and think it is refreshing. We ordered the Spam Croquettes on our first visit and unfortunately it was one of the first things to be removed and never come back. Other items we have tried over the times we have been there are the Bacon Jam, the Chicken Skins, the risotto, tacos, and many others. It seems like the fryer has been in overdrive lately as the fried items are simply too over fried. The bacon jam was heavily seasoned and though some grease is expected, it was taken to the extreme.   We prefer to dine upstairs on the patio, and when it is available, we always request it. Nice view and a peaceful modern setting. The dining area downstairs is a bit cramped and a little too hipster modern for our tastes. The hostess is friendly enough but also seemed a bit agitated at times.   Refills on drinks and water tend to be pretty slow and my biggest complaint: no refills on sodas and no draft beer as they do not have a soda fountain or taps. I really do not like restaurants that only serve canned or bottled sodas but I can deal with it when the food and service make up for it. Unfortunately, Carson Kitchen has fallen short recently. I am sincerely hoping that they will get their shit together and bring back the friendly hipster service and well prepared menu items that I recall them having when they grand opened.",

I had the chicken sandwich and loved it! They lettuce wrapped it with butter lettuce (my favorite) and the pickle aioli was surprisingly good (I usually hate pickles).   I definitely suggest this place for lunch or early dinner. I know it can get busy in the evenings, but it was quite relaxed when my friends and I went. My other friend had the burger and said it was incredibly delicious.   Also the tater tots were super yummy. It may not have been super healthy but it sure was incredibly delicious!   Celiac recommended and approved!",

It's a small space, but always busy and active.  Lively conversation, but not too loud.  There is a great outdoor patio and an upstairs bar.  The venue is first-rate.  As far as food goes, there is nothing on the menu that isn't amazing.  I've had the Burnt Ends, Devils Eggs and Gyro Tacos.  And I've had the Strip Steak, the Pork Chop and salad.  I could elaborate on these items, but words don't do them justice.  They are phenomenal.  Mac and Cheese....heaven on earth.  Olive Oil potatoes....wow.  Cauliflower...awesome.  Yes, there is a theme here.  Nothing has disappointed.  The staff understands how to run a very busy, popular restaurant.  They are friendly, efficient and really helpful.  Having trouble with what to order?   Just ask someone to help.  I'd swear that everyone has worked here for years, because they are familiar with the menu and no one is shy about offering recommendations.  They also get along and work as a team, which says a lot about the management team.  Finally, a huge shout-out to Stacy and Michael for making tonight's visit the even better than the last two.  I am a local and this is officially my go-to place Downtown!",

    "text": "So happy I came here and tried Carson Kitchen after a great recommendation from Lisa R!  I also read the many 5 star yelp reviews and knew as soon as we walked into this eclectic restaurant, it was going to be a fun experience!  They had a 30 minute wait, but we passed the time on their back outdoor patio with wine and shared the warm of the unique fireplace radiating heat, as it was a bit chilly outside.  The hostess sat us in less than 30 minutes at a bar high level communal table! It turned out to be great as we sat next to a trio of really fun ladies from California! They had already ordered and gave us tastes of several of their food selections to help us make up our minds what to order!  We started with the tempura green beans with red pepper cream cheese dip - boy was that yummy! JF had their jerk turkey burger that came with crunchy tater tots (I ate half of them)!  I ordered the red and golden beet salad with grapes & mini goat cheese balls rolled with pistachios and it was delicious too!  We also tasted the roasted cauliflower with a lemony flavor and the truffle Mac & Cheese our communal table companions readily shared with us! They were both incredible! Another couple at our communal table were raving about the Brie and bacon jam they slathered on toasts!  The bartender and our server were both very friendly and helped us with recommendations too.  I even had a second glass of Pinot Noir, which for those who know me, rarely happens!  I can't wait to go back and try more food items!  Our server told us a few items were coming off the menu and were being replaced with new menu items. I love a restaurant who freshens their menu to reflect the seasonality of fresh produce and offers what is best in meats, poultry and seafood too!  So the next time I make it to Vegas, Carson Kitchen, will be on my list of \"must eat here again!",

    "text": "Small plates - big taste!  As I understand it, this place is fairly new.  I had it recommended to me during my last Las Vegas trip by a transplant and a native to the area, so I figured it must be good.  It did not disappoint!  The restaurant is pretty small.  Although it wasn't super busy when I visited on a Thursday night in June, it was still pretty hopping.  Be prepared to wait.  Although they don't have an indoor waiting area, there is a courtyard area just outside the back of the restaurant with plenty of seating where you can wait comfortably --- that is, if you don't mind the heat.  They offer indoor seating at tables and bar areas and they also boast a deck upstairs above the restaurant, so you have plenty of choices for seating.   The menu offers a variety of small plates.  They encourage you to order at least two per person in your party and share.  I was on my own, so there was no sharing going on.  I had a very difficult time narrowing down my choices.  Although the menu was on the smaller side - everything sounded good!  I eventually settled on the \"Green Eggs & Ham\" flatbread - pesto, smoked mozzarella, two sunny side up eggs and ham.  It was insanely delicious!  My waiter recommended breaking the yolks of the eggs with my fork and spreading them over the pizza, like a \"carbonara\".  Really, really delicious.  In an attempt to be lady-like and not come across as a total pig I ate half of my pizza at the restaurant, but wound up finishing it off back at my hotel later that evening.  My waiter was very attentive, friendly and made some great menu suggestions.  He was also knowledgeable of the beverages - explaining that the raspberry cider I chose to drink was best served over ice with some berries, if that was okay with me.  He also commented that the brand offered other amazing flavors, including a pear that was \"divine\" if I could find it for sale back where I was from.    When the check came, it was presented to me in a hardcover book, which based on what was on the page I opened it up to was about brewing beer.  I thought that was a funky and interesting touch.  Although I didn't leave my mark on the book, I noticed on earlier pages many others had signed their names or left little doodles.    While the restaurant itself doesn't have any parking, there is street parking nearby and the Fremont Street Experience parking garage is just a block away.  Speaking of which, the Fremont Street Experience is just around the corner from the restaurant.  This is a great restaurant to hit before or after you do the touristy thing on Fremont.    Near perfect experience --- I'd probably bump this to a five star restaurant experience if the menu had a tad more variety and if they offered an indoor waiting area and restaurant parking.    The food though?  Man... that's as good as it gets!  Check it out!",

    "text": "Before going to the Smith Center, we usually try to dine in one of the downtown restaurants. This time we chose Carson kitchen based on the very positive yelp reviews. Ambiance: despite the fact that the address is on 6th street, the entrance to the restaurant is on Carson. There are dining three areas, indoors, the first floor patio, and an upstairs patio. It was 105 and windy the day we ate at Carson kitchen so the two outdoor eating areas were not real option. The indoor eating area is rather stark and very small. We were party of six and ended up sharing a hightop table with a party of two strangers (nice guys). The table right next to us was another party of six. Unfortunately, they were VERY loud, which doesn't do well in a very small room. They really weren't doing anything wrong. It just makes dining very unpleasant when someone is that loud in that small of a room. Service: Chelsea, our server, came to our table almost as soon as we sat down. Since we were first timers, she explained the menu and answered questions and made some suggestions. Very warm and welcoming. Overall, excellent service. Food: We started with shared tempura green beans. Yummm. We also shared the bacon jam. Very tasty. When we ran out of the bread, we ended up putting it on our other dishes (I even ate some straight up - also very good!!) I shared the Margherita Pizza/Flatbread. Excellent!! I also shared the Cocoa expresso NY Strip Steak. Prepared the way we requested but a bit tougher than I like. Just OK. Overall, the service was 5 star, the food 4 star, but the ambiance made the dining unpleasant. Perhaps I will return on a night we can sit out on the upstairs patio and really enjoy the food. But I would not go back when the only option is to dine indoors.",

Everything was very reasonable priced and far cheaper than any main strip restaurant and I highly recommend it!",

I ordered this per yelp recommendations but was skeptical because I don't particularly like bread pudding. The texture was perfect, the flavor was incredible and the sauces made it unforgettable.

Only a couple of blocks from Fremont St, this minimalist delight appears between a car parking station and a clutch of cheap motels.....don't let the exterior fool you as once inside you are greeted with exposed bricks and beans and plenty of long wooden tables. So it's pretty funky in an unpretentious way....not something that can be said very often about Vegas.  Don't go for the burgers (they look fantastic) as you will miss the ethos of this place which is all about shared plates.  The Mrs and I had four. Mac n cheese which truffley and rich, deviled eggs, veal meatballs in foie gras cream and our favorite, the lamb gyro tacos.  All that for around $50.....amazing value and way better than the other chew and spew options abounding in this part of old Vegas.  The decor is minimalist, with exposed brick and beans, long wooden (shared) tables. The wine, cocktail and beer menu is short and varied.",

Drinks:  Artisan cocktails that are on the menu are great. Not over-the-top. Straight forward ingredients that let the spirits shine through.   Ambiance:  Trendy, inquisitive, rustic. Noise level is high because of the small size and proximity to other diners. My party sat at the chefs table/bar, and it was really interesting watching them create the dishes.   Overall:  Get. Here.

The menu doesn't look any thing different from any other place in Vegas, but DAMN the taste was amazing. We ordered the fried chicken skins - crunchy, hot, and delicious. The bacon jam- well portion, scorching hot, and tasted like heaven.  The steak - perfectly cooked and tender. Oh boy is it a must visit every time we go to Vegas.  We'll be back in a month for sure.

I am going to be honest: best mac n cheese that I have ever eaten, perfect cheese melted together that had the perfect flavor bite that just melted in my mouth... well I guess technically in the pot, but lets not nit pick.  Bacon jam... yes.  Bison burgers... yes.  I saw the prices and I said I am not sure about this... i mean seriously 12$ for mac n cheese. Oh my gosh though, for the price absolutely worth it.   WAIT WAIT WAIT!!! theres more... doughnut bread pudding. That is the unofficial mic drop of this place. So oooey and gooey and puddiney.  THE VERDICT: If you are in vegas try this place out and indulge. Don't go super light, just get a little of everything, youll probably drop 70$ but I promise you... your tongue will just be so hot with delicious happiness.",

The skins make a great appetizer-- they're crunchy, flavorful, and pairs well with the sauce. However, they're very easy to make at home! If you ever purchase a pack of chicken thighs from the grocery store, you could very easily remove the skins from all of them and fry them like this -Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip ($19): 4/5. Expensive-- for $19, you get the strip but no sides. Similar to the skins, the sauce sweetens the food a tad bit. Meat was tender and the red wine demi was a great, unique pairing for the steak -Butter Burger ($14): 3/5 stars. Nothing special, just a burger. The tater tots that came with it tho.... a little spicy but great change from the typical burger & fries",

The beet salad was very refreshing with mandarin orange, cheese, and honey. They know what they are doing and they do it really well! Getting our check was fun too (who knew that was possible)! It comes in a roughed-up book. You can read entries of other customers and/or write a comment! This place is worth the wait!",

Secret Sunday Chicken sandwich is one of my all time favorites from their menu.  Gyro Tacos - I order this at least one out of every 3/4 trips.  BBQ Burnt Ends- love the ranch and house pickles that come with them.  They change the menu 3-4 times a year.  Usually I like the fish menu item, and will likely try. A new sandwich on the new menus.   Service is great.  It's always busy so plan to wait.  But the wait is worth it.  Have never been disappointed with anything we've ordered from there.  Much of the menu is shareable sorta tapas style.  The sandwiches can be a complete meal but most other items I would order a few person and share.  Great downtown restaurant.   Sorry no pics to upload but believe me it's hard to go wrong with anything on the menu.",

    "text": "So, Saturday night in Vegas for two local gals...where to go?  Let's try Carson Kitchen!  Heard it was excellent from all our foodie friends.  Reservation?  No reservations but call on the way and they'll put you on the list.  When we called they said it was an hour/hour and a half wait.  Shit.  When we got there, we were seated immediately and there didn't seem to be any wait at all. Teeny tiny super hipster restaurant.  We were seated right at the pass next to the adorable Cory Harwell, which was a delightful experience.  We got to watch every item come out of the kitchen.  There is a lot of love put into each plate and it was pretty obvious from sitting there.    We started with the Bread pudding, yes, you read that correctly.  We overheard the staff talking about this bread pudding that had no home so my friend eagerly said, \"we'll take it!\"  Um, ok, we'll start with dessert.  What a great start, though.  So yummy!!  Drinks took a little while to get and they were out of ginger beer to make the drink I really wanted, but I ordered something else and it was great.    We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, which was very tasty for a typically boring appetizer.  My friend is one of those annoying pescatarians so if we were sharing an appetizer, it had to be non-meat.  It's too bad cause there were about 10 things I wanted to try that looked amazing like the bacon jam and the empanadas.    At one point I inquired about the chicken skins we kept seeing and Mr. Harwell, made me a little plate of them to try.  Such a nice guy!  And they were ridiculously good!  My friend had the fried green tomato sandwich and I had the short rib sliders.  Both were served with tater tots.  Both meals were perfect.    The staff/service was great albeit stereotypical hipster central.  I think half-way through our meal our server donned new red rim eye glasses.  Very cool.  Very hipster.  The most hipstery thing that happened though was that Tony Hsieh walked in...he frequents all the hipster hot spots, as he is like the hipster golden calf.    The bill was extremely reasonable.  4 drinks, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 1 side (cauliflower- so good!) and the bill came to I think $85.  Strip food with downtown pricing.  Love it!    Oh, and on the way home we tried to figure out what our hipster \"names\" would be.  I think I settled on Schotti or Dylan and my friend landed on Irma.  We will definitely be back!",

The best thing on the menu is by far the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding however I tried the only non shareable meal on the menu tonight, the butter burger. I have to say it was one of the top two burgers I have ever had in my life.  I would list the other dishes that are also great but then I would just be writing the entire menu. If you get the chance, you have got to try this restaurant.",

We were a bit concerned because we approached the restaurant after dark and we had to walk a few unfamiliar blocks, but when we got there we knew it was the perfect spot. From the service by Andrew behind the bar, to every item we ordered from the menu, and the drinks, everything was just what we were looking for. Affordable prices, casual/hip/comfortable atmosphere. Highly recommended. We have been to Vegas a number of times but can't remember a better meal than the one we just had at Carson Kitchen. Thanks so much you guys. We will be back.",

Well... it was just OK but the worst part about it was there wasn't enough bread accompanied with the amount of jelly served so we had to continue to ask for more, which is another reason why the waitress seemed annoyed.  I'm a HUGE mac and cheese fan so I had to order it... once again, super bland.  I had a great time cause the weather was perfect and my company was the best.  Maybe it was just an off night for everyone there (but for a busy Saturday night I expected more).  Maybe I'll try it again...",

For our main course we got a NY steak and a burger. Sounds pretty simple but the was it was prepared was awesome! Our seats allowed us to talk to one of the cooks so it made the experience pretty cool. We ended up leaving only paying $25 each since we split it. Only $50 for all that food!

They even had a gluten free beer on the menu for me, which was greatly appreciated. The food was homey, yet elevated, and totally affordable. Our group of four ate and drank for under $100.

Space is really utilized in this small place,  so you might have to wait a little to get a table or bar seat.  The stacked tomato is a caprese salad dressed to impress,  the flavors are clean and crisp.   Chicken skins are not really my style,  but if you're craving something crispy and salty these are perfect. The jerk turkey burger is perfectly seasoned,  and big.",

Host (girl with curly dark brown hair, believe me next time I'm going to get her name) was SO RUDE!!!!! Both times we went there! First time was my boyfriend 50th birthday. We walked in with couple friends and she told us that we can sit In the bar! So we told her no we wanted a table because we came with couple friends and wanting conversation! So that's when she started being RUDE! Rolling her eyes!! And I think shift manager, Caucasian guy with funky hair was also rude!! He was practically yelling at us when we wanted to sit in the outside area. Anyway we came back again right because again FOOD IS ALWAYS AMAZING!! So second time we arrived at 9:40 on a Sunday and again THE SAME HOST!! greeted us and right away asked \"how many\" as we said 2. And then she said \"oh I'm already booked for the night I can't take you guys!\" And why in the hell did she ask for how many! TAKE HER OFF THAT HOST PODIUM please? She's lazy and RUDE! And she's the face of the business!",

    "text": "You had me at the first bite!!!  I cant say how much I enjoyed this place. From the cocktails to the food to even the staff- all made my and my friends experience amazing.  The location, there is no huge sign declaring itself, but with the smells of grub and laughter from the folks outside, we found the entrace on carson between 6th and lv blvd. Which is important because the door is that easy to miss when you have the sun glaring in your face. The seating did take a bit more than I like especially on a Tuesday at 630 but rather than stay out on carson, we found walked through the restaurant to a door that lead to a surprise serene grassy backyard. It was equipped with wicker chairs and a fire pit. We also saw the stairs that lead to the second floor which is not being used due to the extremely high weather. I predict this will be the place to be in the winter time...beers + fire pit = thats where ill be!!! On to the food...for appetizer we ate the wellington empanadas which smelled amazing as I sliced into those bad boys and we also had oxtail risotto and steak- the best combination and my stomach had no complaints.  The staff was friendly and very knowledgeable about the food. Though there were a couple of times they almost took our plates before we could finish getting all the sauce with our empanadas but that was forgivable seeing as it looked like we were done but in reality it was us savoring each bite. The cherry on top of the sundae was actually not ice cream BUT bread pudding made of doughnuts! I won't describe it because dessert is the point of the meal and why spoil the surprise.",

    "text": "Never have I ever thought of an establishment like this would actually exist at the former John E. Carson Hotel in DTLV!!  Came in on a busy Saturday night with at least 30-minute wait for a table of two.  Luckily, we were able to snag two seats at the bar upstairs which certainly has a better atmosphere than the crammed dining area downstairs.  The rooftop patio has this relaxed and hip ambiance: bistro lighting hanging throughout, awesome music playing in the background and plenty of seating especially for a fairly large group.  Cocktails are rather great in this place.  Forgot his name but the Irish bartender made our experience that much better.  He explained what goes in each libation and even provided few unexpected treats throughout the night.  Out of all the drinks I had, I liked Towns End (Slow & Low Whiskey, Fernet Vittone, Amaro del sole, Regan's Orange Bitters No. 6, Angostura bitters) the most as I usually tend to go for dark liquors.  Asked for a Sazerac next since I was already going towards that route, but unfortunately, no Pernod at this joint!  The bartender, however, decided to make me a drink somewhat suggestive of what the Magarian (Aviation Gin, thyme & honey syrup, fresh lemon, Mr. Q. Cumber Soda) would taste like.  Surprisingly, I didn't mind the transition from dark to light as the smokiness greatly complimented the Crispy Chicken Skin and its smoked honey dipping sauce.  Right when you know I've had enough liquor for the night, I was faced with Brewer's Fix (Hophead Vodka, apricot preserves, fresh lemon, simple syrup, Prosecco) which was amazing due to the fact that a.) it's on the house and b.) I like India Pale Ales.    As far as their dishes, there are plenty of interesting items to choose from.  For this visit, we opted for their shared plates.  If you were only to get one thing from the menu, make sure it's the Crispy Chicken Skins.  Something about a chicharron-like chip dipped in smoked honey sauce is just sublime!  Another favorite was the Veal Meatballs smothered in sherry foie gras cream sauce.  Yes, sherry foie gras cream sauce... it's truly as good as it sounds!!  Also decided to get the \"Devil's Eggs\" (topped with crispy pancetta and caviar) and Roasted Young Beets (pistachio, orange and goats cheese).  Still have plenty of room?!  End your meal with the Glazed Doughnut Bread Pudding (three rum caramel and vanilla creme anglaise).  It ain't no sticky toffee but it's a great alternative.  Overall, Carson Kitchen definitely lives up to all the buzz!!  Delicious food, impressive concoctions,  great ambiance and superb customer service.  Can't wait to go back!",

We were greeted by the hostess and sat down at the long bar tables closest to the actual bar.   I open concept in a small room makes everything really exciting - you can always see what's going on behind the bar, in the kitchen, what other people are ordering. It's nice to see other dishes that you didn't order, the presentation and even the reactions people have to the taste. (Which all reactions were a thumbs up!)   To start, we order two cocktails, Easy Does It and #SimonSays sangria, both which were amazing!   We ordered most of our dinner off the starter menus since everything on the menu is meant to share we figured it didn't matter where we ordered from.   Devil's Eggs with caviar, amazing! Bacon Jam is a must, Secret Mac& Cheese, not your ordinary Mac! Gyro tacos, even more yum! We also order Alligator flatbread, and as if that wasn't enough we also ordered the killer shrimp, which was killer, as well as the wineberry shortcake!   All in all this tiny eatery provided for a awesome date night, great atmosphere and great food and service! Highly recommended! Plus, the menu changes every 4 months!",

My friends and I ate there last night and this is a recap of the good, the bad, and the angry:  -The bacon jam was great -The brownie dessert and donut bread pudding were fantastic! -The Turkey burger was good but not enough \"slaw\"  -The cauliflower was far too salty to even stomach -The sliders were dry but are on the right path  -They charged us for a steak that they had informed us they were out of and forgot to take it off the bill. They clearly do NOT know how to work their POS and charged my card 4 times for the same meal and so my $65 meal has now cost me $275, a call to the manager, and fraud reports to my bank. Unacceptable.   All in all we ordered the following:  Wellington Empanada \"Devils\" Eggs Jerk Turkey Burger Rainbow cauliflower Short Rib Sliders Glazed Donut bread pudding Burboun fudge brownie with brown butter & bacon ice cream  The only way I will return is if I am just getting drinks/dessert and I pay cash.",

Food comes piping hot as it is prepared so it's probably best for everyone in your party to approach your meal 'family style' if dining with a large group.   Don't Miss:  Veal Meatballs Cauliflower Beet Salad - Although portion size is ridiculously small for the price...sharing this dish is nearly impossible if you want more than one bite.  Broccoli Salad Tater Tots - Yes...they definitely came out of a freezer bag you could buy for $1, but just trust me on this one.  Chicken Thighs   Good: Oxtail Risotto Cocktails  Doughnut Bread Pudding  Decent:  Shortrib Sliders - They were fine, but nothing special  Skip:  Mac & Cheese - Same old truffle oil with a bunch of cheese. Honestly nothing special and extremely heavy and greasy.  Overall really cool concept. Not sure if I'll be a 'regular' at this spot but would recommend it to friends.   Dined upstairs on the patio as well as the main dining room. Wait for a table downstairs if you're dining in the summer unless you're looking to sweat to death during dinner.

    "text": "We ate at Carson Kitchen last night and loved it!  Great local spot in downtown Vegas with well-executed cocktails and tasty food.  We arrived a bit early for dinner and we were greeted and seated right away.  We were seated at the high top table right next to the bar and shared our table with several other groups.  I liked seeing the items our table neighbors were ordering.  There are a few \"alone\" tables if people prefer not eating with a crowd of strangers.    We ordered the Gyro Tacos ($10) made with a generous portion of well seasoned ground lamb topped with just enough tzatziki, cucumber, and tomato. Usually this dish comes three to a plate, however our gracious server suggested we add one more taco to have an even split between us.  Glad we agreed! Really enjoyed this item.   We also split the Jerk Turkey Burger ($14) This item was topped with mango chutney slaw and served with a small cylinder filled with tater tots.  The burger was cooked just right and had a nice spicy afterburn from the jerk seasoning.  We love slaw and the slaw topping on this burger provided a nice acidic pairing to the spiced burger patty.    As far as the cocktails, we both ordered a \"Towns End\" ($10) which was served in a lowball glass with a giant round ice cube, I'll upload a picture.  Being whiskey and bourbon lovers, we found this cocktail to be excellent.    Last but not least was desert, we tried a sweet potato pie dish served in a short mason jar with a crispy marshmallow topping and two very tasty cranberry biscotti on the side.  I liked the pie, but  really loved the cranberry biscotti, must be the Italian in me!   Our server was great, food came out quickly and every item was cooked perfectly.  We would highly recommend Carson Kitchen to friends and we do plan to return.",

    "text": "Wow, we had a terrible experience here.    Upon arrival on a Thursday evening with a group of 4 we were told there was a 45 min wait. No problem there at all. We know the drill and have eaten at many small and popular  places in the past. We grabbed drinks at the bar and snagged a seat by the super nice fire pit.  About 45 min later the hostess comes out and says that their larger tables are done dining but are still chatting. Again, I understand. I run a small business in the service industry myself and these things can be hard to manage. Another 20 min goes by with smaller parties getting seated one after another.  The hostess again comes and apologizes saying the other parties just simply wont leave.  After ten more minutes one of our guests actually kindly approached one group of guests at the bar and explained the situation and they gladly gave up their bar seats.  It is a bummer to have to sit at a bar with 4 people after such a long wait but such is life.    Upon sitting at the bar it seemed pretty clear that the bartender either was having a rough night or just didn't quite appreciate our presence. However, the old fashioned she made for me was delicious.  That was about the only thing any of us enjoyed during the visit.  I was stoked to try the gyro tacos and was incredibly disappointed. The mac and cheese was pretty good but the oxtail risotto was pretty awful.  Sitting at the bar we struggled  to get our waters refilled and never got any sort of acknowledgment or apology for our 90 minute wait for bar seats after being quoted a 45 min wait. We just sat quietly disappointed eager to finish eating and leave.  I am not sure that I have ever left a negative review for a restaurant nor have I ever sent a dish back. Generally, I am pretty patient with mistakes especially when they are acknowledged, but I was shocked by the lack of hospitality we experienced.  It is also worth mentioning that while we were leaving, the party that was holding up the table was still sitting down with their food in to-go containers just talking.    This place is cool and interesting but lacks heart.  It felt like they wanted our money and for us to \"ohh\" and \"ahh\" over their \"innovation\" but at the end of the day it never felt like the staff had any interest in making you feel comfortable, seen, or appreciated. While leaving this review I noticed the way the owner responds to negative feedback that he feels is unwarranted. I cant help but think that sort of culture is exactly what contributed to our experience.  Maybe it was a bad day, maybe this place is as awful as I think it is. Either way, I think there are a lot better places to spend your money and time while in Vegas.",

We got to sit at the counter and chat up Lauren as she made our margherita flatbread. It was AMAZING! Best dang flatbread we've ever had. For dessert we tried the Bourbon Brownie and Glazed Donut Bread Pudding. The bread pudding is redonkulous!   The only thing that kept this experience from being 5 stars is Chef Mutton Chops yelling at the sous chefs right in front of us. We had been watching them the whole time and they were doing an excellent job and it just wasn't cool seeing him come down on them. Not very professional and left us with a little bit of a bad taste in our mouths. Still gonna come back for that bread pudding, though.",

I ordered the butter burger and it really surprised me, looks can be a little deceiving, the perfectly shaped patty makes you feel like these are just your run of the mill processed burger, but I was completely blown away after the first bite. It was so juicy and tender and delicious, the exact taste you're looking for when you're looking for a burger. We also had the jerk turkey burger which was also really amazing, it was a tad on the sweeter side with the mango coleslaw, but also a winner.",

    "text": "On a weekend getaway, the Hubby and I decided to forgo the dining on the strip to check out this little gem in Old Vegas. This part of Vegas looks like it belongs in San Francisco -- kind of a hipster feel to it. Be careful not to drive past the restaurant - it doesn't have a gigantic obvious sign, so you'll have to look out for Chef Kerry Simon's face on the window. I think we circled that block a couple of times until we finally saw it.   The restaurant is small and cozy. We were lucky to be seated at a bar that was in open view of the kitchen - that was a nice surprise. Our server was so incredibly sweet and made the experience that much more memorable. The food was both creative and delicious. Here's what we ordered:  - Fried chicken skin - Pasta carbonara topped with a fried egg yolk  - Bacon jam - Award winning turkey burger - Bread pudding (made with vanilla glazed donuts from O-Face Donuts next door)  Everything was delicious, but we especially loved the fried chicken skin, bacon jam and bread pudding! That bread pudding. Wow. Definitely don't pass on this dessert even if it requires you unbuttoning your pants to allow yourself some breathing room. It's definitely worth it and a reason to go back.   Only suggestion would be to the kitchen staff - if you're sous chef'ing it or prepping right in front of your guests, you might want to at least take a second to make eye contact and just drop a little 'hi, how are you?' We weren't so lucky - in fact, it looked like this staff member may have been having a horrible day, if we had to guess. Didn't know if it was policy to not interact with guests while working but it didn't seem to match up to the warm service given by everyone else at CK.   A fabulous experience nonetheless and we will definitely be back! So glad we checked this place out.",

As we headed towards the unlocked, unblocked, door with no \"closed\" sign or indication, the manager began yelling at us across the restaurant. His tone along with a waving finger were embarassing and offensive in a restaurant full of people. The hostess then calmly explained the patio was closed for cleaning. Not an apology or even another glance from the rude manager until we sat down to eat.   The food was decent, our group shared  several of the appetizers, entrees, and desserts. The waitress, Nicole, was very nice and attentive. I was given dirty silverware and requested a clean spoon, which they brought as well as comping our dessert.   Overall, a 4/5 for food quality, but I stick to my rating of 1/5 as an overall experience based on the incident that instilled my first impression.",

    "text": "So, I finally had the chance to visit Carson Kitchen in Downtown Las Vegas a few weeks ago for lunch. I had really liked Kerry Simon's previous restaurant, Simon Kitchen & Bar, at the HRH, so I figured that his newest restaurant near the Downtown Container Park would be pretty good. And my thoughts were that they did not disappoint!  THE DECOR (4.5 out of 5) Upon entering the restaurant which seemed to have some lower ceilings, it seemed to not have that much of a dining area beyond a few tables, the bar area and seating near the kitchen. However, they do have a larger area upstairs on their rooftop patio which I think would be great for parties. The restaurant is kind of dimly lit, but with plenty of accent lighting in the bar area and in the kitchen, so I kind of liked it. It had a hip but intimate vibe to it. They also had an outdoor patio area where we waited for a couple of seats to open up which was nice, although that might get a little hot in the heat of the summer.  THE SERVICE (4.5 out of 5)  So after a short wait outside on that patio, we were seated at a couple of chairs that were immediately adjacent to the kitchen where we were literally a few feet away from one of the prep/sous chefs (not exactly sure what her title was, so just go with me here). Our server explained that many of their dishes are of the shareable kind and was attentive to our needs when we needed a refill, etc.  THE FOOD (5 out of 5) And what did I think about the food? I thought that it was delicious! We had a couple of \"social plates\" of the Bacon Jam (which was awe-some.....and I wish that they would jar that stuff up because I'd buy a few jars of it if they did) and the \"Devil's\" Eggs with crispy pancetta + caviar (I liked it although I think that I would've liked to have had the pancetta more thinly chopped, my preference). Then I had the Pork Belly Cuban Sandwich which came with spicy tator tots (which was great and came with tasso ham + manchego cheese).   Next time I'm going to try the Crispy Chicken Skins and the Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto which a really good friend of mine (also another foodie) said were really good!  OVERALL (5 out of 5) Overall, I think that Carson Kitchen is more like a 4.5 out of 5, but since Yelp doesn't offer any 1/2 ratings, I decided to give it 5 stars (as 4 stars just isn't quite enough). So, if you're looking for some really good food, I'd highly suggest checking out Carson Kitchen as it is now my \"GO-TO\" spot Downtown.",

Next came the bacon jam with Brie. Wasn't really a fan of it, was more of a BBQ dish than anything. Coming off of those tacos I was so excited, but left disappointed. Next came the deviled eggs, husband isn't a fan of deviled eggs, but I had him try it. I thought they were delicious! Caviar on top so a great final touch. Pancetta was really crispy, reminded me of eating those fake red bacon bits. Maybe switch up the meat. Next came the lamb chops. Wasn't overly impressed. They were good and cooked perfectly. Just didn't tickle my fancy.   Service: fantastic. Great job Chef and team!   Would defiantly come back as their menu rotates. Which I believe every great restaurant should do. Great place! Sit up at the chefs table for the full experience!",

    "text": "OMG!!!!  Best food I've had since moving to CA 2.5 years ago. Let me explain- I moved from Austin Tx (which by the way has amazing New American restaurants, not just BBQ) to San Diego CA. I'm passing thru LV on the way to ski in Alta UT and need a lunch break. Yelped and came up with Carson Kitchen. Got there on a Wednesday  right as they opened at 11am. Good thing as they were full by 1145.  Amazing prompt service, super friendly staff.  Had the bacon jam ($12) smokey, sweet and with a spicy kick served with a little melted Brie and grilled baguette.  Saved some to try with other items.  Next came the Mac and cheese($12). Creamy perfection with a slight hint of truffle.  Great too with a tiny bit of bacon jam. Then the espresso NY strip($18). Perfectly cooked and so tender that I cut it with my butter knife. Again, even better with a tiny bit of bacon jam. Can you tell that the jam is amazing?  Everything is made to be shared, so two or three dishes were more than enough for lunch between the two of us. But then we couldn't pass up the Donut Bread pudding. ($8).  Oh wow!!! Crumbled Donuts mixed with butter and stuffed in a mason jar and baked until brown and yummy on the outside then served with a light buttery rum sauce and creme anglaise.  Perfect finish, though I am now stuffed.   Very good wine list by glass or bottle ($7-10/glass) and great selection of microbrews by the bottle (most from CA-$5-10).  Nice little original cocktail list.  I tried a Standing 8 Count as I don't like sweet stuff.  It says it's made with tequila but it was so smooth that I didn't get a hint of tequila taste until the end. Barely sweet with hint of chocolate bitters, mint leaf and hint of lime.  Seats 48 people during day and at night when upstairs patio is open seats an additional 43. I'll be back on my way back from Utah. Lunch and dinner menu are identical and same prices. Lots of locals there at lunch.",

For food, they're known for their Bacon Jam and their Mac & Cheese. It's usually pretty busy but has a totally different, almost local, vibe than the rest of Vegas. I highly highly recommend coming here round 6 or 7 and grabbing dinner and a drink before doing the normal Vegas thing. Chances are, you'll catch more of an authentic feel here than anywhere else in the night.",

    "text": "Having done a lot of research on this place I was looking forward to this downtown delight.  First off, if you didn't know it was there you would have trouble finding this spot, but it's worth the hunt.  As soon as you enter the place you feel as if your transported out of downtown.  Carson's is a small joint, but does well with the space it has.  Lots of bar like seating forces you to engage your fellow patrons in  conversation. The place is very clean and you can see everything from the bar to the cooks prepping your food.  Very cool atmosphere.  The place only went up from there.  Our waitress Tara was absolutely amazing.  Going over the entire menu, telling us what has changed,(Cause they are in the process of changing their  seasonal menus.) to recommend her personal favorites, and occasional checking in on us without being pushy.  Everything a waitress should aspire to be.  Well done Tara.  This food is designed to order several different things, and to be shared amongst your party.  This mite force you to abandon your virtual partner / cell phone and have to participate in conversation which I love. We decided on the Chicken Skins, Gyro Tacos and their Mac and Cheese; with a couple tasty brews to top it off.  All the food was amazing with an abundance of flavor and the perfect portion size. Was defiantly full when I left.  We finished it off with bread pudding that was a good balance of cinnamon, caramel, and vanilla.    With the redo of Downtown if full effect; this place is a perfect addition.  The only downfall is the lack of seating, but if you go during non peak hours you will be fine.  Well done to you Carson's Kitchen you are what is right about a local eatery.  Will be back soon.",

    "text": "I love the space and the vibe. It's my kind of scene. I also like the menu though it's a bit limited. Two friends and I came here for lunch and decided on a handful of dishes that looked interesting.  Cheddar Crab Fondue ($11): Served with a variety of carbohydrate vehicles - pretzel bread, cheese crisps, and baguette - that all worked well with the cheese. The group favorite was the pretzel. This is a really great dip/spread.  Bacon Jam ($12) with baked Brie and toasted baguette. There is so much buzz around this jam, so of course I had to try it. The sweet and salty bacon jam with Brie is good, but not my thing. Also, there is not nearly enough baguette for the amount of spread - it is so rich that you don't need very much of it. We asked for more bread (an extra $1 for a few slices).  \"Devil's\" Eggs ($8) with crispy panchetta and caviar. I believe the term \"caviar\" is used loosely here as I'm certain the fish roe on our deviled eggs were not from sturgeon, but rather black tobiko (flying fish roe). The deceitful description is very disappointing, especially because these eggs were really delicious.   Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto ($14) with Parmesan cream. This is a beautiful and fun dish. I didn't absolutely love the flavor, but there's a comfort factor that I enjoyed.  Roasted Young Beets ($9): Pistachio, orange, and goat cheese. The beets were delicious and I liked all the elements together, just a touch sweet.  I wasn't blown away, but I'd love to try their other dishes. I won't write them off just yet!",

    "text": "How portentous must you be to attend this place? I'll tell you. It's recommended to arrive in full hipster swag, sporting a beard with an extended mustache with curved tips a la Hercule Poirot. Only then do you have the luxury to purchase three tiny 'gyro tacos' the size of one regular street taco from pretty much any of the (pretty well reviewed) taco trucks I've been to. For eleven bucks! Want a diet coke to wash that down? I'm surprised they have such low class beverages at a hipster joint like this. But they do. But it comes in a tiny bottle that they up charge for, and it's not on the menu (secret menu for regular people drinks).   When the hipster culture becomes a self-licking ice cream cone, you get hipsters opening portentous little restaurants, frequented by none other than? You guessed it, hipsters (and those who happen to do google searches for top rated restaurants in downtown, only to be fooled by self-licking reviews into coming to this overpriced joint) with a bar.   The normal looking white collar guy sitting next to me had the same opinion of the portion size (tiny hipster size) and the taste of the 'bacon jam'  - both pretty awful (they charge thirteen bucks ! for a slice of baked brie in some jam, and dried baguettes, as though putting brie cheese into jam and cayenne pepper makes sense, or more sense than these items served separately. Hint: it doesn't). The white collar guy next to me rejected his dish after trying it, and I don't blame him.  Want even more portentousness? When the server brings you your minimalist dish, as though you were dining at a high cuisine restaurant, he explains the dish to you, perhaps to distract you from the tiny size of the food on the plate. Apparently the sea bass is citrus encrusted with the skin still on the side for some reason. The cost of citrus encrusted sea bass? Approximately a nine inch length of it (I'm very familiar with this size) will set you back eighteen smackers.   If you wanna feel good about your social group, and you belong to this group, then by all means, luck the ice cream cone you helped scoop. If not, save your money and go to a normal restaurant where diet coke and beers are on tap.",

    "text": "Charmed by this oasis of down-to-Earth, inspired, stylish food that would do any Pacific Northwest foodie town proud. We stumbled upon this place (rather, this entire cool block) after going to Pawn Star's Gold and Silver Pawn. Hungry for a food experience not involving jousting, velvet chairs, or a reservation next August, we turned to Yelp for recommendations. Carson's was at the top of the list and, as per usual, Yelp delivered.  Carson's is basically too cool and real for Las Vegas. It's well off the Strip and in a part of town I've heard called \"seedy.\" For some reason, I was expecting an area reminiscent of Detroit, but, as all artistic types know, \"seedy\" can be, and often is, synonymous with \"artist area.\"   ATMOSPHERE We parked across the street (it was so easy) and were greeted from the outside by bistro lights draped over a Summe-ry deck, appropriate typography, and a view of some cool interior lamps and community seating... Very promising! Once inside, we were promptly and warmly acknowledged and seated at the long table in front of the open kitchen area. The decor was restrained and laid back (as only these types of hipster-y restaurants can be), but still conventionally \"nice\" and upscale enough to be considered a fancy date night type of place. There was an actual fire place outside at which people could smoke and gather... I bet that kicks ass in the summer!   SERVICE Was also quite impressed by the fast, fun service. The chefs and servers were all pretty quirky and friendly and we enjoyed their hospitality as they explained the dishes and even their own histories with us.   FOOD I ordered the lovely beets which were freshly cut and naked except for drizzles of honey, nutty cheese, and fresh tangerine. So delicate, earthy and good!  We also ordered the Rainbow Cauliflower, which was just baked enough. The florets had a subtle toasted flavor without being burnt, and were tender but firm and cut up into just the right sizes. Believe you me, in my experience, it's truly difficult NOT to burn those florets (or have them come out of the oven like a limp, soggy noodle), but this place pulled the dish off perfectly.  I have to also give an additional shoutout to the Terducken Pot Pie. It's basically deconstructed pot pie and is incredibly original in its deconstruction, reconstruction. The \"topping\" of the pot pie is in fact biscuit crumbles that are lightly toasted and very flavorful. The Terducken part speaks for itself in terms of flavor and juiciness and is seriously off the hook.  I wish my stomach was bigger because I would have ordered so many more dishes if I could have!! Alas! I'll have to come back here sometime to try the flat bread... If it's anything like the rest of the food, service and atmosphere, we'll be in luck.",

Service: Very good to above average. Everyone seemed happy to be working here, and it showed.   Price/Value: I thought was on par for the venue and service   Taste: I selected the steak based on yelp reviews and was disappointed but I have no doubt there are other dishes that are good. The fried mac and cheese was on par with the sides of similar establishment and the donut bread pudding is a must have if you visit this establishment. I was debating whether or not to indulge and I'm thankful I did !   Conclusion: Although given the price and taste I would typically rate this around a 3. The bread pudding and the service and the acknowledgment that I just selected a dish that wasn't my \"thing\" bumps this up to a 4 star.",

    "text": "Your typical hipster eatery located right in downtown--need I say more?  Food here is good, as was the presentation. Came here with a friend and ordered the bacon jam and tempura green beans (per yelp mentions). My friend really enjoyed the bacon jam, but I wish they gave more bread.. The tempura green beans were really tasty, esp with the chili cream cheese that came with it. We also got the short rib grilled cheese (I'd skip this one, it had a weird taste to me) and the black rice oxtail risotto (yum). Overall very tasty and such cute presentation.. you really can't go wrong.  The real winner here was the glazed donut bread pudding. We also ordered the bourbon fudge brownie but you can skip that and just order two of the bread puddings. The glaze was the piece de resistance.. according to the menu, it is a three rum caramel and vanilla anglaise. YUM. Get two, or get three and give one to me I won't ask any questions. ;)  The only thing here is that it's in downtown so parking is not great. Also I think they wanted to sit my party of two at the bar but we requested a table. They said they usually get busy and don't allow parties of two to sit at tables but since it was a slow night, they were able to accommodate. I believe there was outside seating too but it's starting to get chilly here in Vegas so we opted for inside seating.  Oh! And donut bar is next door. If you come early enough to do both donut bar and carson kitchen, you are a lucky yelper!",

    "text": "Highly overrated place. Food was not good, the goat cheese and beet salad was overall terrible and bland, besides the touch of honey that seemed underwhelming. The oxtail risotto with what seemed like remains of ox tail bits, with a overall lack of flavor as well. The pig and ft flatbread also lacked any real flavor, besides what the pickled figs provided, again not much flavor or wow factor to the dish beyond the clever name. I was quite surprised as this place comes highly rated.",

    "text": "We walked in as a group of 11 and they couldn't seat us right away due to our group size. Our bad, we didn't think to call in advance. But no harm done, we got drinks at the bar and took them into the garden/patio they have in the back. It was very pretty and we enjoyed ourselves. After an hour, they called us in for our table. Here is what we ordered:  1) Mushroom Flatbread - 5/5 yummy, generously topped 2) Broccoli salad - 3/5 cold salad with a sprinkling of sunflower and pumpkin seeds. It tastes okay. 3) Beet salad - 4/5 if you like beets this is a good one to have. It has mandarin oranges which provide a nice citrus flavor. 4) Macaroni and Cheese - 4/5 what is not to love about mac and cheese. I just took out 1 point for portion size. this is more of a side than a main. 5) Tater Tots - 5/5 6) Chicken Skins - 2/5 Personally did not like the way the chicken skins were seasoned. I guess the honey was supposed to be a nice touch but did nothing to add to flavor. 7) Bacon Jam - 5/5 Delicious!!  8) Burgers - 4/5 Try it with the Bacon Jam.  Service was terrific, Our server (I forgot his name) was really helpful with recommending dishes and pacing our meal. He was very knowledgeable and we found his insight valuable when navigating the menu.   Is this worth checking out? I would say so, especially if you are staying in Downtown, this is walking distance and very convenient.",

This is important to me due to Roy's exiting the market.  Carson Kitchen is a small funky spot located a long block South of Freemont Street (and coincidentally next to the best donut shop around).  I was solo this trip and seated at the communal table facing the kitchen, a nice touch.  The crafted cocktail was excellent and the Sea Bass was probably the 2nd best piece of fish I've ever had (another nod to Roy's and the Butterfish).  The servers are friendly & professional, the room is attractive and the portion sizes are just right.  Any restaurant with this many great reviews has to be good.",

It's a pretty small place and it's a lot of open/social seating so don't be surprised when they sit you next to other people.  Also, it's more of a small plates type place.  I recommend planning to share and spending a decent amount of cash.  I had glanced at the menu so I was expecting $15-20 a person, but realistically $30-50 a person will be a more enjoyable experience.  Everything we ordered was great.  I devoured the veal meatballs.. sooo much flavor.  I wish it would've came with more.  The secret sunday chicken sandwich was very tasty and I recommend that as well.  And you must finish with the glazed donut bread pudding.  It was so delicious!  We also ordered some german potato salad, cauliflower, and a pork chop as well.  Those were all great, but not as highly recommended as the options I mentioned previously.  Get here early if you can. I would imagine this place would be pretty hard to come to with a large group.

This place has something going for them, innovative tapas. The menu is a social or sharing menu, meaning you order several items and share them amongst your group.      We ordered a bunch of items, Bacon Jam, fried chicken skin, gyro tacos, charred octopus, and kicking shrimp. All of our food was very good and interesting in concept. The Kicking shrimp was exceptional, one of my faves.     We also order the donut dessert, which was out of this world. It is worth a visit just for this dessert.

It was spaced out very all and had a nice aesthetic to the place!   The waitress told me that these meals are supposed to be sharing dishes, which created a fun atmosphere! We ordered the meat pizza (forgot the exact name) with the risotto which both were to die for! The food was prepared quick and all prepare fresh made.   The service was great as well. The waitress was very friendly and helped answers all questions since this was my first time going! I am excited to go again to taste out more food and then that might just change this to a 5 star review!",

    "text": "This was a great brunch spot close to downtown (within walking distance), and driving distance from the strip. Apparently they get very busy and don't take reservations, so plan ahead. We got there just as they opened at 11:30am on a Sat, and our party of 6 was able to be seated right away.  We got the following: Bacon jam ($13): highly recommend this. It comes with toasted baguette and this delicious bacon savory spread with Brie cheese. So good. Baked Mac and cheese ($13): another sharable side. The truffle flavor wasn't as strong as in other Mac and cheeses I have had, and the serving size was a bit on the small side. It was very good with the bacon jam on top though. Gyro tacos ($12): would probably skip this next time. They had a nice Greek flavor to them with lamb, tzatziki, and feta, but didn't wow me.  I also got the butter burger ($14), which was a pretty filling burger. I liked that they came with tator tots, which was a nice change from the usual fries.  Their desserts looked super tasty as well, but we were too full to try them. Next time!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came to Carson Kitchen early on a Wednesday night. We had not made reservations, but we did not think it would be that busy mid-week. We had about a 1/2 hour wait, and later found out it was because the restaurant was also hosting a food tour group that night. We were seated at the bar, which was pretty neat as we got first glimpses of dishes as they were meticulously prepared before being carried out to the tables. We got to chat with the phenomenal Emmett, who was great at recommending dishes and also telling us neat tid bits, such as this is a restaurant that Gordon Ramsay frequents. My boyfriend and I both ordered the burgers, which were made to perfection and served with tasty tater tots (that have a surprising nice kick to them). For drinks, I had a glass of the Riesling, which was on the sweeter side, like I prefer and my boyfriend had a bottle of the Anchor Point beer. And even though we were full from our burgers, we had to try the bread pudding, one of Gordon Ramsay's favorites here. Emmett, our amazing chef, had prepared the pudding just for us, and carefully lathered it with the sauce to make it picture perfect. Every bite of the pudding just melted in our mouths. We can't wait to be back to this hidden gem of downtown Las Vegas.",

Our server explained the menu.  Most of it was tapas style.  We enjoyed trying each of the items we each ordered.  The green beans and veal meatballs were good. The butter burger was big.  It was very juicy even tho I ordered it med and no pink.  We all shared. My daughter's Mac and cheese came out last.  It was yummy.  It reminded me of a warm garlic bread.   It was rich.  I'd come back to this restaurant.",

We feasted on delicious gyros tacos, deviled eggs w caviar and crispy pancetta, cocoa-espresso NY strip steak, a beautiful presentation of red and golden beets with goat cheese rolled in ground pistachio and drizzled with honey.   Another tasty savory dish was snap peas in smoked paprika butter with harissa cream. And the \"pork wings\" are delicious fried pork belly bites in buffalo blue cheese beurre blanc. Needless to say, we had no room for dessert... although I was sorely tempted by the brown butter bacon ice cream!  There are also flatbreads, interesting salads, sandwiches and more that make this a place we will return again and again.   A selection of craft cocktails plus a well-curated list of wines, ales and lagers includes gluten-free and cider options plus non-alcoholic sodas.",

It's a bit smaller on the inside, although there may have been additional seating upstairs that we didn't see? Reservations aren't taken and we were a large party coming at prime dinner time on a Saturday, and LUCKILY we didn't have to wait too long to be seated (only roughly 10 minutes). They have a modern concept in terms of decor, I just wish that the seating was a bit more comfortable since we were all sitting on hard barstools. The food was delicious though, we had communal fried chicken skins with smoked honey and bacon jam with crostini's; 3 of us ordered the Mac and cheese (had heard how popular this was and I do consider myself to be a bit of a Mac and cheese connoisseur haha) which was delicious albeit small, while the others ordered tacos, the flatbread, the Brussels sprout salad, and the risotto. The prices of the food ranged from $13-15 and they had a good selection of alcohol, overall we had a positive experience!",

They're not the most comfortable seatings and I like chairs that have a back to them. Onto the food!   Bacon jam: I always get this when I come here. It's a must! Other than bacon and Brie, I'm not sure what else is in it but it taste like a bit of heaven to me. Comes with several slices of toasted baguette so you can slather on that heavenly goodness.  Gyro tacos: topped with feta cheese and diced tomatoes. Wasn't a huge fan of this one. It just tasted kind of blah.   Grilled cheese short rib: perfectly cooked. Short rib was tender and tasted excellent with the cheese. Bread had a nice crunch to it without being too hard. Comes with a side of spicy tator tots. These tots are seriously the most delicious tots I've ever had. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I'm in love with them.   NY Strip steak: cooked medium rare. Highly recommend getting this! It was juicy and the spices gave it amazing flavor.  Didn't get to try the desserts this time but I have my eye out on that glazed donut bread pudding! Will for sure be back!",

    "text": "My sister and I have been trying to coordinate a double date with our dudes for some time. With one person working graveyard, another waking at the crack of dawn for work, and yet another working swing with varied days off, this took some calendar finagling. When we finally managed a date and time, Carson Kitchen was chosen for the January outing.   I preface all this because, in choosing Carson Kitchen, I will admit two things that actually came out of my mouth when reviewing the menu. These statements have been saved to the \"Regina's Douchebag Quote of the Day\" archives:  1. \"Man, I hate paying for deviled eggs\".  2. \"Um. Chicken skins are not new, people.\"   Okay, on the chicken skins, I used to buy them by the pound when I lived in CA. They came with garlic vinegar. They were amazing. I used to peel fried chicken skins off of pieces of chicken and eat them for myself. My resistance to them on this menu comes from a place of \"oh, NOW they're cool?\". I know. I know. Still a douche...    Anyway, I still think that I was overdue for a visit here, having heard rave reviews from practically anyone that's been. Having now been in for dinner myself, I agree this is a solid choice for a meal at a rather decent price point. At the end of the night with two rounds of drinks each and a shared dessert, we each paid about $50 with tax a tip. Really not bad for the thoughtful food and drink menus.   I have some qualms though:  - Seating mostly sucks. I would pay an extra $10 per person for chairs with backs. I felt like I was Asian squatting throughout my meal. Where's my Filipinos at? You know how when you were little and your parents got those tiny plastic, bright colored chairs for you to use in the shower? Yeah, that's how it felt to me.  - Dining room is cramped. Along with squatting through the meal, I didn't really have anywhere to put my coat and my bag. I ended up covering my knees with my coat and having to finagle around it.   - The deviled eggs were good, but I'm still mad that I paid for them. My husband reminded me that the caviar was a nice touch.   - Dining room is loud. I don't think this is really a negative. It's just something to keep in mind. When I got home, my voice was hoarse from screaming through our conversations.   With the qualms, come the notables:  - The fried chicken skins were delicious. The smoked honey was the real MVP.   - The black rice oxtail risotto was exceptional. This was probably my favorite item of the night. The bite from the black rice, richness from the oxtail that was mixed into the dish, brightness from the gremolata, and the overall creaminess. DAMN. It was goooooood.   - Great drinks.   - The red snapper in panang curry was presented in a way we weren't expecting. We thought we'd see a whole or side of fish on a plate. The presentation in a bowl confused us; even partially disappointed if I remember correctly. This was all washed away by perfectly cooked fish and spicy, wonderfully delicious sauce.   - The donut bread pudding has us scraping the bowl despite previously all agreeing we were stuffed. I expected it to be overly sweet. Instead, it was caramelized and buttery, but surprisingly clean. Well done.   Downtown is a bit of a trek for me so I don't know how often I'll frequent this, but a great evening was had by all.",

The food was fine, though nothing I would crave enough to go again. The Wellington Empanada was a cooked just right, but a little too salty for me. The drinks were strong and the bartenders were as slow as molasses, so I wasn't a huge fan.   The service was great and the staff was so helpful. A few hiccups of forgotten refills and plates to the wrong table, but it happens with new spots and they handled it with a bit a humor. Overall, it was nice to check it out, but I don't know if I would go anytime soon.",

Carson Kitchen's menu is refreshing and worth every penny.   I was with a group of friends and everything we ordered far exceeded what we expected. We had ordered the deviled eggs and chicken skins to start off with.   The eggs were so soft and very airy and the chicken skins were the crunchiest I've ever had.   We each ordered different entrees, but we had ordered the butter burger, which was a perfect medium-rare, the chicken thighs, rabbit ragu, and the black rice risotto.   I ordered the risotto and it was a smooth, creamy texture and the black rice was al dente, just how I like it. The rabbit ragu was hearty and the rabbit wasn't very gamey. The butter burger was juicy and flavourful and the chicken thighs with chimichurri were herby and light.  All in all, this place should be on everyone's list of places to eat. Definitely worth it.",

Such examples are crispy chicken skins (a play on crispy chicken tenders) or hot oysters (a play on boneless chicken wings). When I went there, I tried to order items that aren't typically found on everyday menus. I ordered the chicken skins, the hot oysters, an asparagus burrata salad, and some crusted lamb.   Most of the food was tasty and really interesting to try out. I never thought having chicken skins would work so well as an appetizer. The hot oysters were spicy, but I really liked the idea of trying an oyster that was coated with wing sauce and out of the shell. The burrata salad was quite unique; never have had a salad like that before, but the flavors inside the salad complemented each other. The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium-rare and had the perfect amount of seasoning. Overall, I would recommend trying it out if in the area.",

Honestly, I was worried when we first walked in that this was going to be one of those trendy types of places and we would be treated differently if we didn't \"fit\" in but it wasn't like that at all!! So dont feel intimidated like this is a place for locals or a certain type of trend because you will miss out. Everyone is super friendly and our server, wow, was super sweet, knew the menu, knows about beer (which is a super plus for us because we love beer), and was very attentive in a good way! I was very impressed with the staff and the food. We had the chicken skins and the butter burger. To me the chicken skins were okay I kind of wished we ordered something else not that they were bad they just werent what I was feeling I guess. The burger was so delicious, the burger patty was super thick and juicy. We've had a few burgers on the strip and they dont even come close to this. The burger here was so so good I highly recommend it and I can't wait to come back and try the mac n cheese and a few other things. The kitchen is open so you can watch them prep and make food while you eat. They  have a decent selection of beer that is not your usual everyday beer. Awesome place!",

The reason why i gave a 4 star is because i wanted to add chicken to my salad, like I've done in my previous experience, and our waiter told us that it wasn't possible. Also, we had reservations at 8:30pm which wasn't ready til 45-60 mins later.  Besides that, everything was perfect.",

We actually didn't make it passed the starters because they all sounded so good we just couldn't decide, so we had most of them for our dinner! The cavier deviled eggs were amazing, the bacon jam with brie is delish!! I loved the tempura green beans, they were crispy & not soggy or greasy at all!  We also had the wellington empanadas and they were spot on!  We had the crispy chicken skins too and they were ok, not my favorite.  The dessert was amazing!  We had the brownie with bacon ice cream! YUP I could have eaten a pint of that ice cream. LOL The service was good.  Our server was friendly & attentive, but not overly on top of us.  She was awesome.  We'll definitely be back and we'll be checking out the rest of the menu :)",

    "text": "Always on the lookout for a great meal the fiance and I just had to check out Carson kitchen. Everything was pretty much right on point. We started with the bacon jam and the deviled eggs. Both dishes were excellent. The bacon jam would be amazing every morning on a breakfast sandwich with a good runny egg. The deviled eggs were a great contrast to the in your face bacon and smokiness of the jam. Very suttle  on the flavoring but in a nice way.      We also had the rabbit ragu, delicious. The use of spaghetti squash instead of pasta was very appreciated. It just really makes the dish work and you don't go into a carb coma after polishing the bowl clean. At the same time we throughly enjoyed the veal meatballs with peas. An excellent interpretation of a classic veal and peas dish.  Finally to end our fabulous meal the amazing chicken skins arrived. They were everything I thought they would be and more. I mean who doesn't like delicious crunchy, salty, spicy animal skin. The honey balanced the great flavor of the skins and made me want to get a basket to go.  Forgot to mention the drinks. They were good not the best I've had but solid. We came for the food though so that's what matters. The beer selection was decent. A nice mix of craft brews. The specialty cocktails all sounded great but the 2 we had were just unbalanced. Not taking any stars off because they were still good and second fiddle to the food.  All in all a great meal and well worth the trip. The location, people and vibe reminded me of home and the neighborhood I live in. I will always have to make a pilgrimage to Carson kitchen whenever I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "This cheeky little restaurant has earned it's way into my top 10 hip places to go to in Vegas. Found in downtown. A two story location-downstairs indoor dining with a bar and outdoor balcony seating upstairs. The staff was super welcoming and Andrew the bartender was awesome! He made us feel right at home with good conversation and quick service. We went with appetizers: crispy chicken skins with honey and veal meatballs. As a main course we chose the black rice with oxtail risotto. The skins were like potato chips-crisp and slightly salty. The veal meatballs were juicy and bite size. Easy eating and the sauce they pair with was enough to make me just slurp it out of the bowl. But please...I really just want to talk about the Risotto. All I can say is FOODGASM! It was an amazing fusion of meaty, cheesy, juicy and creamy goodness. That's it. Just try it. I've dreamt about this for days now. The serving is generous and can be shared between 2-3 people along with additional protein to balance it out.   We snagged both of their dessert options. They have a decadent bread pudding-fluffy and rich and also...a brownie with brown butter bacon ice cream and a strip of caramelized bacon. Yes. I said it. Sugar and bacon and ice cream and chocolate. Talk about a trip to heart attack town. It's worth it.   You could literally order all of the items off the appetizer menu and have a complete meal to share between 2-3 people. I will be visiting again and again. Thanks for the great time Carson Kitchen. You did not disappoint.",

I had the root beer sliders, meatballs, burger, devils eggs, and cucumber soda.  Loved everything.  Only gripe is the root beer sliders are too sweet and takes away from the integrity of the beef.  Portions are moderate and pricing is average to high.    Cool urban concept that looks to add to the growing downtown dining scene.  Service is casual but attentive.

We tried the chicken skin appetizer, meatballs and Mac and cheese and New York strip. All done in their own unique way and awesome. All the dishes are made for sharing. Fun atmosphere with open kitchen. We had fun joking with the staff while waiting for our food. We were too full for desert but the manager some how managed to give us a bread pudding on the house. He said that we needed to try it. House favorite! Man did that not disappoint, unreal. Stay away from the hotel eateries and come here at least once during your stay.",

    "text": "Giving this place an okay and passing 3 stars. I do not write reviews but I came into this place with pretty high expectations and I'm pretty disappointed. I'm just motivated to write this review out of sheer disappointment.  Came in Saturday night around 9:30. Already missed the dinner rush but this place was still packed and the vibe and ambiance was still upbeat. We sat at the counter and got a good view of the kitchen. Our server Courtney was very nice and pleasant.  Ordered the Magarian for a drink. Aviation gin, thyme, lemon, honey, and cucumber soda water. It was pretty standard. Nothing special.  Now the food. Ordered the beet salad. The cauliflower. Veal meatballs. Steak. Sliders. Tacos. And the fudge brownie for dessert.  I think I like this dish just because I love beets in general. Came with orange slices, goat cheese, and pistachios. Eat everything together and it's good. If you're not a beet eater you might think this dish is awesome but if you're like me this dish is just your standard beet salad.  Veal meatballs. Nicely executed but I found the flavor lacking. Meatballs were light and not dense. Prepared and cooked nicely. It was actually enjoyable to eat except it needs more flavor. It was under seasoned. The sherry foie gras cream was nice. Though you can't really taste the foie. It was a rich sauce but not reminiscent of foie at all. So that under delivered. And the peas, I don't know what it's doing on that dish. It could've been a pea shoot salad with a nice zippy dressing to cut through that cream.  The steak. We asked for medium rare and it was cooked medium rare. Nice crust on the steak, pink inside, and a nice sauce to accompany it with. But for a restaurant with a reputation like this I already expect that you know how to cook steak. Although maybe they could've used some finishing salt here. Fleur de sel. Himalayan. Black. Any salt sprinkled on top by the kitchen to let me know there's some thought in this dish. Don't just send me a piece of meat. Send me a piece of meat with some \"oomph!\" Oh and please. Don't tell me about the salt shaker! For 18 bucks I think it should've came with a side of something. Potatoes or cream spinach or asparagus spears. Just something, anything to eat with the steak. Doesn't have to be big or a lot. Meat needs something. Even Michelin rated restaurants give you something. Mind is not blown here.   The lamb gyros. They were good but you can live with skipping it. Find real lamb gyros somewhere else. I just have to say that the meat tasted like spaghetti meat sauce without the sauce.  Short rib sliders. We ordered these under the recommendation of our server. She said these are to die for. I thought otherwise. I didn't read the description on this because I trusted our server so I took a bite knowing full well what short ribs should taste like. Meaty, rich, deep, earthy short ribs except they were not!!! I love short ribs so I was very, very, very disappointed. There was something sweet in it then I read the description it said rootbeer glaze. It might as well say sugar syrup because you can't taste the rootbeer. You just taste sweet.  There was no taste or note of caramelization to merit it to be even called a \"glaze.\" That was a sad excuse to call it a \"glaze.\" It wasn't deep or rich. I picked apart my slider so I could taste just the meat and it was just blah. It is shockingly dull and under seasoned. The slider buns came from a bag. They weren't warmed or anything. Eating it felt like a chore. Also served with tater tots. Which probably was the highlight of the dish... Maybe the night.   Now the dessert. Bourbon fudge brownie and brown butter bacon ice cream. The ice cream was good. Enjoyable actually. But that brownie. My god! that brownie! That brownie was served to us frozen hard as a brick. It was so hard that when we tried to slice it the brownie flipped out of the plate and onto the floor. Didn't need utensils at all cuz we were eating what's left of the brownie with our hands. Picking it up and biting off bits of it like solid chocolate. It was terrible.  We also ordered the cauliflower because our server recommended it but the kitchen might've forgotten to make it. Dessert came and our check came but our cauliflower never made it to our table. It was still included in our tab though so I just asked the server to take it off. She let the kitchen know what happened and Courtney came back and apologized and took it off out check.  Would I come back here? I might. There are other dishes here that still interests me to try. I wouldn't take my out of town friends here though. There are other great places to try out, experiment, and enjoy. It's a nice looking restaurant with a cool vibe and ambiance to it. It's a cool spot to be seen but the food while has great concept suffers from the lack of depth of flavor and under seasoning.   Final note. When working in the kitchen: TASTE TASTE TASTE TASTE! Taste your food before you send it out to us!!",

Excellent service, great atmosphere, can't wait to go back!",

After waiting outside for the restaurant to open, which you could clearly see people (staff) inside by the door and which I had tried to open earlier, no one came to ask if I was waiting or to even acknowledge restaurant was open. I was first in restaurant (with no line at all). The hostess asked if I wanted to sit at the bar and with no other patrons in there I asked to sit at a table. The manager (man) said they do not seat party's of one. First, no one is at the restaurant and second,  I have seen in past reviews people said sometime multiple parties would have to be seated at a table. I guess I should have known the experience was not going well when there was no line unlike other places close to this one.  The manager did say as I was walking out the door if I was going to leave they could seat me at a table...no thank you I prefer my food with at least decent customer service!!! I will let my local Vegas friends as well as people visiting to go to another place! Update: I was contacted by Cory who was very gracious and apologetic. I want to thank him for his quick response. Next time when I am in Vegas I will give the restaurant another try, but sometimes you have only one chance to make a good first impression.",

Simple recipe, but loaded with delicious flavors. We liked it so much we ordered a second serving! We also had the beet salad, which was good (I like my beets a little crispier, but I think I'm in the minority), and the watermelon cucumber feta salad (which was really great; super salty feta really brought out the other flavors) for appetizers and enjoyed all of them. We split a steak for dinner and it was super, super delicious. The coffee / chocolate rub was kind of charred in a super nice way with the center still rare - fantastic. And we ate at the bar and got to BS with a hilarious Irish bartender that was also fantastic. Loved it. Plan to go back tonight.",

I absolutely loved it and will definitely be back.  The atmosphere is great. It's unique, and both downstairs and upstairs have their own vibe. Downstairs feels like you are in a crowded kitchen, but you feel like you get to see all of the action, which is awesome. Upstairs is more relaxed, with a view of the city. I also loved the fireplaces outside in the courtyard.  Our cocktails were great. The Towns End was reminiscent of an old fashioned. We had a bunch of dishes and shared them all. The standouts were: Crispy Chicken Skins, Veal Meatballs, the steak, Broccoli Crunch, and the shrimp. The only thing we didn't like as much were the gyro tacos.  I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu.",

We had...Devils eggs, Pear & Brie flatbread, Bacon jam, Shepherds pie, and Cocoa Filet, followed by Bourbon brownie with maple bacon ice-cream. We also sampled the Chicken skins. I can't even review, every single thing was amazing, I'm afraid I don't even have the vocabulary to credibly review. You just HAVE to go and review for yourself. There's nothing on this menu you won't love!!!!!! Go now!!!!!",

    "text": "Even with the address in hand the location of Carson Kitchen was questionable since there was no sign with the name. The neighbor a doughnut shop jumped out at us with a large sign. We were seated immediately. Our arrival was mid way between lunch and dinner and there were several available tables. Our server promptly provided water and our cocktails. Initially the noise level was loud due to a table of six people. Once they received their food the talk level declined. Our server explained the menu and advised the food would come out as it is ready. We ordered the following  Killer Shrimp Secret Sunday Chicken  The Shrimp came out first. Very taste and crunchy the pepper creme and sliced jalapenos added some nice heat. A very enjoyable dish.   The chicken was ordered without the bun because we heard that it's a large breast. Right on it was large. The fried chicken was the best crunchy breast ever. Delicious!  Our table was in full view of the open kitchen and we could see them repeatedly check the chicken with a thermometer to insure it was cooked just right. The chicken comes with tater tots that are deep fried grated potato balls. They were crispy outside & soft inside. Goes well with the aioli or ketchup.  The wait time for the chicken was exceedingly long. At one point our sever brought over a complementary order of baked mac & cheese and apologized for the delay. Don't know what happened to cause the delay but when the check arrived there was no charge for the chicken. I questioned our server and she stated the chicken  was complementary due to the long wait. I was not expecting that response.  The baked mac & cheese is a large portion that easily feeds 2 people. I tried the mac & cheese but not being a fan I can only say it was tasty and filling..  One improvement I would like to see is padded seat cushions. Wood chairs become uncomfortable after a while.",

They mentioned that everything should be shared and they also had sandwiches. We went with the broccoli which was tossed in green goddes dressing, dried cranberries and pumpkin seeds. This was so fresh and delicious. I had the jerk turkey sandwich and my husband had the Sunday Chicken sandwich. We cut our sandwiches in half. I have to say that jerk turkey burgers sandwich was amazing. These were also served w spicy tots.   I was stuffed when I was done. Like super full. This is a place worth eating at and good prices too.",

Cute artwork on the walls, romantically dim lighting. Pretty nice staff.   We ordered gyro tacos and they were good. The lamb was not that stinky aged kind, and the tzatziki sauce was nice. We also ordered the secret Sunday chicken and they should have kept that a secret from us customers. It was worse than Chik-fil-a (sorry if you like that crap)! Soggy, salty, meh. It came with tater tots and I wished I'd filled up on them first. Not bad!",

    "text": "Where do I begin?! Carson Kitchen is definitely a top 5 meal. I came here for Nikki B.'s wedding reception. We occupied the outdoor private patio for the evening. It was nice that it had a separate bar and our servers tried to make it as comfortable as possible for us with blankets and patio heaters for the unseasonably windy/chilly Spring evening.   But, let's get down to business - everything was so dang good. There was seriously not a mediocre dish on the menu. The wonderfully curated menu is also a product of Nikki B's fantastic tastebuds, so shout out to the bride as well!   *Crispy Chicken Skins (smoked honey): The chicken skins were beautifully crispy and delicious without being oily. The touch of sweetness from the smoked honey was perfect.   *Bacon Jam (baked brie, toasted baguette): Definitely burned my tongue on this dish because I was being hasty and I wanted to try it ASAP. Delicious combination with the sweet and savory bacon jam and creamy  baked brie.   *Tempura Green Beans (pepper jelly cream cheese): The pepper jelly cream cheese reminded the table of pimento! Yum. The green beans were perfectly battered and fried.   *Wild Mushroom Flatbread (basil pistou): I love me some mushroom and I love me some flatbread. I really enjoyed the pickled red onion on this. Helped to add some zing.   *Rainbow Cauliflower (garlic, lemon): Definitely leaned tangy from the lemon, but I enjoyed the palate cleanse.   *New York Strip (cocoa-espresso, red wine demi): PERFECTLY cooked. It was so tender that I didn't even need a steak knife to cut it. Also, cocoa-espresso is some next level Food Network stuff -- meaning I'm too lazy to make it myself at home, but I see it on the time on TV. & now that I have finally tried this combo, I feel like I can't go back to plain ol' salt & pepper!   *Chicken Thighs (mint chimichurri): Very tender! I also loved it with chimichurri. I don't think I've had the combo of chicken & chimichurri before.   *Black Rice Risotto: Yum! Great foundation for all the great protein we had.   There were 3 addt'l dessert items, but we were all so full that the delicious wedding cake was enough. WHEW, it was a food marathon and we were champs.   Viva Las Babies!   106/365",

    "text": "The epitome of Vegas style cuisine.  Vegas cuisine?  It's New American with an \"I did it my way\" attitude.  Fresh and seasonal ingredients, some \"bad for your health\" results but all boasting big flavors that match requisite craft beers and cocktails and all playful enough for social dining.    Tip: All dishes are meant to be shared.  Ask your server about portion sizes.  They can be adjusted based on the size of your party.    Note:  Dishes will be served when they are ready.  They do complement each other well so coursing is not important.    Standards remain excellent.  The flour and spice dusted, deep fried chicken skin is crack in a basket.  Dip a crackling into the slightly bitter smoked honey and taste the bacon-esque essence of chicken skin.  Not to be outdone, the bacon jam.  Sweet, salty, bacon goodness.  A melted smear of brie adds earthiness and actually cuts the richness.  Smeared on a charred baguette, a sip of an Old Fashioned and all is right with the world.  Need veg?  The \"Broccoli Crunch\" stands out.  Vibrant and refreshing.  Raw, young broccoli florets, pumpkin seeds, and a sunflower seeds tossed with a light green goddess dressing.  A few cherry tomatoes thrown in for their acidic burst.  Incredibly refreshing and works well alongside the richer dishes.  The rainbow cauliflower and Spring asparagus both equally good.  The charred octopus is outstanding.  Slathered in oil, aggressively spiced, and charred to the point the tip of the tentacle is crisp.  Bitterness adds huge complexity when combined with first of the season fingerling potatoes.  The saffron aioli ties everything together while a squeeze of a charred lime adds acidity.  Finally, the crispy skin salmon, is simplicity at its best.  A perfectly cooked piece of salmon, its skin ethereally crisp, a trace line of spinach pistou (macerated spinach, garlic and olive oil), and a charred lemon ripe for the squeezing.  Rustic perfection.    Well chosen but short list of beer and wine.  Excellent craft cocktails.  Great bartenders.  Service is off Strip, very friendly and energetic.  Reservations recommended even for a week night.  In a word, outstanding.",

I decided not to order anything and to my surprise a worker came over with a huge smile and went convinced me to order.  I'm so very glad he did, I ordered the steak as well.

    "text": "Carson Kitchen was the location we chose for a day date when Grandma decided to watch the little guy and allow for some adult time.   I guess I didn't realize that this was like a secret place. After driving down 6th St. looking for some signage we decided to just park it and walk. Thankfully the dude at the Doughnut Bar told us it was right next door. No signs, nada.   You walk into a modern design restaurant with a separate bar area from the main dining room. Not a big place at all, very intimate. You can see the kitchen, and all the action taking place which I love. We weren't greeted all that warmly and had a short wait then were shown our seats. We sat at a community table, which isn't my preferred dining style. Fortunately we had a corner which allowed a little more privacy. The couple that sat next to us disliked the seating options even less than we did. With limited space, it's necessary in a restaurant like this.   Our server was nice, but didn't offer up a ton of suggestions after we told her it was our first time here. So winging it we decided to order the veal meatballs and the bacon jam to kick things off.   Our apps were solid. The veal meatballs had a little gaminess to them and the cream sauce was really tasty with a hint of heat. The bacon jam was a solid app, definitely got more than we expected. It could have used some more brie though. You get plenty of bread to dip, the jam itself was really good, sweet & savory. It's served in a cast iron skillet which is a great touch.  For our entree we decided to share the Short Rib grilled cheese. It was good, but didn't blow my mind. Short rib was tender, Gouda was a good combo, but it just didn't knock my socks off which I was expecting. I'd probably try something else next time.  The dessert we ordered was outstanding. We went with the Bourbon Fudge Brownie which is a brownie (no nuts!!) that has a fudge layer on top, gooey brownie underneath and is served with the most amazing butter bacon ice cream to compliment this concoction. It just works. It works so well. Definitely the highlight of the meal for me.   We left Carson Kitchen stuffed and happy. Definitely will give it another go down the road when Grandma decides to offer up another opportunity for a day date.",

    "text": "After hearing and tons of raving reviews about Carson Kitchen, I needed to see what all the buzz was about. From the street, it didn't appear as though the restaurant was open, so I called and confirmed that they were open.   Once inside, we were promptly greeted by the hostess and seated. Our table for two looked like it belonged in a tiny house. Instead of adult chairs, we had little stools. As a curvaceous woman, I was like what kind of nonsense is this?! But I digress. Just know that there's no back support for the seats.  Our server was very attentive and accommodating. I wish I knew her name.  Right now, I'm refraining from eating meat, so coming here may not have been the best idea. Most of their vegetarian dishes are merely side dishes. Here's what we tried: Baked Mac & Cheese, Rainbow Cauliflower, and a Wild Mushroom Flatbread. The mac was the best dish of the night, the cauliflower was WAY too lemony, and the flatbread was just okay. The portions were small just like the little chair I was seated on. Even the prices seemed a bit inflated and we were not in a high rent area. Plus, it didn't look like much money went into the decor either.  Ugh, I hate to be that one, but I wasn't blown away. My experience was underwhelming, which makes me feel sad inside.",

Sea Bass is my favorite.  Crispy, seasoned, delicious! Brussel Sprouts Ceasar.  No Romain.  Only shaved BS.  Delicious! Crispy chicken skin.  Yes just the skin! Delicious.

We ordered all three desserts in the menu -   The bread pudding was great!  The brownie was good and had a bit of cinnamon to give it a Mexican chocolate feel. The ice cream that came with it was okay.  The \"pie\" was my least favorite and was marred by the accompanying biscotti that was so hard it felt like a tooth breaker.   The service was really slow - it took about 30 minutes for our desserts to arrive.   Cool vibe inside with industrial design. Servers were nice but perhaps understaffed as we weren't given updates on why things took so long.   A decent time overall but not somewhere I'm likely to return to.",

We got here 30 minutes before closing on a Saturday night and they welcomed us with open arms even though we were the last ones left. We started with the popular BBQ Burnt Ends and some cocktails, of course. The pork had a great crunch and not too fatty smothered with bold tasting highland ranch sauce. From the cocktail menu, I tried the Purple Haze made w/ Nevada H&C Silver Dollar Vodka, St. Elder Liqueur, fresh lemon, mint, creme de cassis and blueberry preserve. This was a fantastic strong drink so I ordered another :)  Then we just decided to get a variety of entrees to share including the Shrimp & Antebellum Grits, Black Rice Oxtail Risotto and another popular item, the Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip. No favorites here because each dish had its own unique flavor and presentation. All I can say that everything was well executed and prepped with passion. Plus the prices didn't break the bank. Appetizer, grits, and risotto were about $15 each and steak for $19. Pretty sweet!   With over 1500 reviews and still growing, Carson's is definitely a must stop in Downtown Vegas. It's a friendly and casual, no attitude local establishment that simply serves reasonably priced excellent food.",

This place is amazing, small, intimate, casual but not too casual and located just around the corner from Fremont East, it is easy to walk to and park.  We started out with cocktails.  My martini came ice cold as ordered!  We then split a bunch of starters.  The Beet salad was awesome, Cauliflower app was surprisingly good, especially since I'm not a cauliflower person, the veal meatballs were also great, the Gyro Tacos were very tasty and how can you go wrong with grilled octopus.  Believe it or not, we then had dinner!  The salmon came out crispy the way we live it and was very fresh, the wild mushroom flat bread which was a last minute afterthought turned out to be the home run hit, the burger was amazing (it always is here) and the coffee rubbed strip steak was perfectly cooked and tasty.  Overall a GREAT evening.  Thank you Carson Kitchen",

I've been at Carson Kitchen twice now and it's always a great experience. The service is excellent and it's pretty fast.

It's not just this visit but the last four times we have been here in the past year. Nothing has gone smoothly, really, since the remodel and the original opening staff left due to the long closure. You get seated and you can't even get water served to you for at least 10 minutes. The orders come out of the kitchen all wrong and most of the dishes are not what your brother would've wanted because the kitchen staff has turned over since he has passed and they don't know what they're doing half the time. We used to love this place but not so much anymore. Tonight we ordered a bunch of food, as always, and it came out in the wrong order again. The butter burger was literally braised in salt so that was a no go! I was the one that ordered that so I went away hungry as I sent it back. No time for a reorder when you have show plans and are already sitting in this place for well over an hour and a half. The beet salad is one of our favorite dishes but the guy that prepped that  out in the kitchen just set them on a pool of honey instead of a honey drizzle and why? That's not the way it has been done in the past, so are you not training your staff anymore? Every other thing we ordered was minimal as well. We always say that this is the last time that we will ever return to this restaurant, and I think we said that four times now but really this is the last time! Please get your act together, something that would make Kerry proud! I cannot recommend this restaurant at this time. The wait is too long, the service is too slow, and the wait staff as well as the bar and kitchen staff seemed to be overwhelmed! If this last visit didn't solidify never going back there again, certainly all of the harassing PM's, accusations and name calling from the owner all day did! Minus 1 more star for that.",

    "text": "Expect a long wait for food and seating. Besides that, customer service was spot on!  I ordered the squid ink pasta because I haven't had it since I left Italy. I was expecting a creamy base but I received different. The pasta was black, there were tiny pieces of calamari and the base had a strong olive taste. This was an interesting dish and perfect for olive lovers. Was it worth the price I paid? For the portion and quality, eh, I'll pass. I also didn't enjoy the pasta strands clumped together. Makes me question the freshness.   Yelp convinced me to order the glazed donut bread pudding and I was not a happy camper. What's with the hype? I can get a better donut for half the price. It's basically a warm, glazed cake. The warm sauces swimming at the bottom of the plate added value to this dish.",

    "text": "I've gotten takeout from Carson Kitchen while driving through Vegas from Utah to LA, and I was pleased with what I got. Following Yelp's recommendations (of course), I got:  - Bacon Jam: 3 stars. Don't get me wrong; the jam itself is amazing. A great combination of balsamic reduction and smokey bacon flavor. The texture is great and the combination with the baked brie is wonderful. Unfortunately, the \"toasted baguette\" made it difficult to enjoy the jam and cheese. The slices were so dry and hard that it made chewing a chore. If I were to eat here again (and assuming they offer fresh bread at the table), I would eat it with the fresh bread instead.  - Gyro Tacos: 5 stars. I am a gyros fan. Big-time. Lamb is my preferred meat, and if you roast it over a spit, you are my favorite. I loved the idea of sticking the lamb, tzatziki, and toppings on a corn tortilla. Delicious combination; I highly recommend it.  - Glazed Donut Bread Pudding: 4 stars. I love donuts and I love bread pudding, but I remember this being a bit dry for my taste in spite of the three rum caramel and vanilla creme anglaise they gave me on the side. I expect that I would have preferred it in-house, where they pour the caramel and creme anglaise over the warm bread pudding and impart more moisture. I, however, ate it dipping-style in the car.  Thank you, Carson Kitchen, for a solid meal!",

    "text": "What a meal! I am normally not searching for fancy restaurants when I am downtown but I will make a point to come back here. Its behind the strip so you aren't overloaded with all of the mess there but just close enough to safely walk. It is definitely not for large groups as the seating is small tables for about 4 or so.   The beer and wine list is a great selection. I had a glass of rose that was crisp and not too sweet. They have beer from the local brewery Big Dog as well which is a great touch. I will say the beer options are limited for non IPA lovers so be aware of that. We each had a couple of different appetizers to share and none of them were disappointing. Between all of we shared the chicken skin, bbq burnt ends, bacon jam, and pig & fig flatbread.  All of the food was flavorful and perfectly cooked. The chicken skin was addictive on its own but add the honey and its so many flavors in each bite. The burnt ends were flavorful and just sweet enough with the sauce being the stand out part. Now the best for me was the pig and fig flatbread. The pork belly was perfectly cooked and paired great with the goat cheese. It was salty sweet and just a bit tart. Get this when you go here.   Also on top of all of this the staff was amazing. We showed up with a large party not knowing the layout of the restaurant and had to wait a while. With all of the confusion and miscommunication the staff was A+ with service and made sure to make up for any of the confusion on our part.",

Please know that this place has become popular over the years since it's opening and there may be a wait period of 10-15 minutes.  The good news is that since its recent remodel, if your solo or a couple, there are additional seating at the chef's bar or the adjacent bar to sit at.  My co-workers and I were seated promptly when a table opened up and our waitress was quick to come and get our drink order.  After drinks were ordered, we ordered our food and know that this menu is Ala Cart, so order your favorite sides to enjoy with your main meal.  Burgers and sandwiches come with crunchy and tender tator tots.  I ordered the short rib grilled toasted cheese sandwich with horseradish and sourdough- so delicious!  My favorite is the steak cooked to your preference (in this case rare) and it was phenomenal!  For starters, a staple would be the deviled eggs with smokey crispy pacing bit topped with a dollop of caviar.  The BLTA ( bacon, lettuce, tomato, & avocado) will be a great light filler.  From start to finish, the dining experience never disappoints.  If you're in downtown Las Vegas, consider coming here for lunch or dinner and enjoy a nice ambiance, experience, most importantly, some good food fare and leave with a smile on your face as well as a full belly!  :)",

We arrive and are promptly greeted by the host, he was super nice. This place is small so there isn't a lot of seating but we were able to cozy up to the \"chefs table\" aka the bar type seating looking into the kitchen. This was fun!  Our server was very attentive and asked if it was our first time. When we told her no she quickly explained how it worked. Everything is basically ala cart so order several plates.   Baked Mac & Cheese- AMAZING! So creamy and delicious! I cant tell you what was in it other than amazingness.   Coco-Espresso NY Strip- AMAZING! WOW! The flavor was out of this world! The meat was tender and cooked perfectly.   BBQ Burnt Ends- Wow! Soooo good. Flavor was extraordinary.   Bourbon Fudge Brownie- This brownie was out of this world good, fudgy and perfect. And the ice cream... WOWZA! Topped with a piece of bacon... where can you go wrong?   It was also fun being able to watch the kitchen. Everything is made to order and with such perfection and enthusiasm. It genuinely felt like everyone in the kitchen was passionate about making sure every dish was absolutely perfect.   Overall amazing food and such a great experience.   If you don't believe me read the other 1151 reviews haha!  PS- Make sure you write a note in the book that your receipt comes in and look for my name =)",

We got seated at the bar overlooking the kitchen which was ok. From there service was ok, our server seemed a little busy. For the food we had the deviled eggs (one of the better dishes) and the bacon jam (good but a little too greasy). The veal meatballs were pretty delicious, but the special of black rice risotto was a miss. Maybe I could have ordered a little better as I missed a couple dishes.  Overall though, the food was good. 3.75/5",

I don't always make it to all of them based on different circumstances (size of group, activities we're doing, etc) but Carson Kitchen was one of these places and I'm trilled that we actually made it!   My boyfriend and I got to Carson Kitchen a bit past lunch time after a night of drunken debauchery on the strip and this place really soothed our souls and put us back at peace with the world. Let me start off by saying that the service was incredible! Everyone we spoke to was very friendly, helpful and the kitchen staff got our dishes out at lightning speed!   Lets get to the nitty gritty of Carson Kitchen though: the food. AMAZEBALLS!! Per advice of our server, we ordered several different dishes to try. Everything was delicious! We ordered the tempura green beans with pepper jelly cream cheese, the veal meatballs with sherry foie gras cream, coco expresso NY strip with red wine demi sauce, black rice oxtail risotto, mac and cheese and of course the glazed donut bread pudding for dessert.  The portions were perfect for the both of us as we devoured about 95% of all the food. Our server even brought us some extra bread to make small bites with the steak and mac and cheese, genius! My boyfriend literally had his mind blown by all of the flavors these dishes had.  Carson Kitchen, I love you. Please come to LA. Specifically Highland Park so I can walk in several times a week and fall in love with you again. In the meantime, I'll see you again in March. I'm counting down the days.",

The secret's out, though, so you may have a wait depending on when you stop by. Trust me, it's worth it.  If you can, and the weather's not oppressive, try to sit outside upstairs. It's a nice space, and the bar will keep you hydrated. I was especially impressed with the Angry Tony, with it's use of mezcal.  Food-wise, this is the kind of place where you could eat with your health in mind, but don't: you're gonna deny yourself some good eats. I loved the Devil's eggs, the gyro tacos, and the baked mac and cheese. Service was great, and our guy kept an eye on us throughout the night.",

He forewarned us that's we'd wait, but that it'd be worth it.  We did indeed have a small wait of 30 minutes, but a cocktail on the back patio killed that time quickly. The cocktails are solid, \"Damn, Daniel\" is mighty tasty and I knocked back a few by the end of the evening.   We were seated at the bar, where Geronimo took care of us, mixed our drinks, provided a few laughs and was always quick with a recommendation.   Our party of two ordered a wide mix of different plates and shared. This was the perfect way to do it. There was a lot that we wanted to try and this was a great way to do it.  The Deviled Eggs are great, the Gyro Tacos are a must, smoky bechamel on  the Mushroom Flatbread is unreal.  By the end of the night we even gave dessert a try. The Glazed Donut Pudding was killer, but the Chocolate Tart was a little too much...   Overall, it was an awesome experience that made Carson Kitchen a place that I look forward to coming back to... and I did... the next day for lunch.  And, Round 2 was just as good.",

    "text": "First, try to find it. the address is Sixth Street by entrance isn't on Sixth Street. Do you think you could give us a clue on the side of the building? Secondly, Its small and service is oblivious. We sat with a view of the kitchen but the servers decided to grace us with their butts by bending right in front of us and leaning on the counter for the duration of our stay.  Thirdly, don't expect to get a decent meal. This is Tapas at its minimum. Finally the area isn't great. Parking is a joke and sadly homeless people are a plenty seen going thru garbage and trying to survive. Bottom line... with so many famous chefs overcharging and producing small plates all over the strip why bother with this one all the way downtown with so little to offer?",

We were fortunate enough to sit at the table top bye the chefs/kitchen. If you like special drinks we highly recommend the Get Shorty. It was so tasty with tequila/fresh grapefruit and cayenne pepper. We ordered the bacon Brie Jam. Very rich dish; recommend ordering if you have a group to help finish off the large portion. The pork belly fig flatbread the super tasty. However the jerk turkey burger stole the show! With the spicy tater tots and the coleslaw, the jerk turkey burger was simply fantastic! Even my husband who is not fond of turkey burgers couldn't resist having half of the turkey burger. Will definitely be coming back for more turkey burgers and Get Shorty cocktails.",

Once you've had your fill of Fremont's Experience cross the street into a swanky but down to Earth atmosphere.  What a great vibe this area has with open air bars, friendly staff and good eats crammed into every corner.  Carson Kitchen was fairly crowded for a Thursday, the wait was about 20 minutes, perfect timing for a HH cocktail:) We had the shrimp, bacon brie, turkey jerk burger, chicken sammie and topped it off with an amazing dessert! Their menu changes weekly so you could keep coming here and not repeat the experience...  Wish I could take this place back to DC with me! If you are in town I would highly recommend this as a must eat. Nice change from Vegas Strip feel!",

We were seated at the bar.   Server was attentive and quick. Took our drink and appetizer orders. We got the tempura green beans, which were amazing. I find that most fried green beans I have are almost always too oily, not these. I ordered the Tomato Stack which wasn't overly filling but was flavorful. Lastly we got the bread pudding. As other have mentioned they use donuts from next door. It was so good, I wanted another one. Definitely a must try!   Would love to be able to comment on more of their dishes, so I'll definitely be back soon!",

Our starter was their famous chicken skins with smokey honey sauce ( a must). Our accompaniment was the veal meatballs (sooo good). Our drinks were great with DAAAAAAMN Daniel and 68+1 being our choices, and were so good, that we had a second drink with dinner.   Great service and a modern American-Tapas style will surely please the most demanding appetite, and particular palate.",

I would suggest sharing everything as their plates are kind of tapas style except for their burgers. Burgers are huge BTW so don't expect to be able to finish that and have sides without leaving feeling overly full and uncomfortable.   This is what I had to eat starting with my fav (I shared of course): 1- Mac & Cheese- it's so gooey with cheese but not overwhelmingly stinky or heavy, very good mixture of cheese and whatever used to thicken the sauce. I couldn't get enough and I'm definitely not a cheese person.  2- Margherita pizza(I forget what it was called)-  Slightly heavier than expected so I would put it between a normal pizza and a margherita pizza.  3- Jerk Turkey Burger- This thing was huge! The sauce was like a mango salsa and went with it well! I didn't even think it was like a turkey patty, tasted like a normal beef patty. Yay for less fat without trying! 4- Their normal Burger- Tasted like any other gourmet burger would taste so it was up to par, no complaints except that it was huge! 5- Green Bean temppura- It was a little salty but the sauce went well with it. I probably could've done without this but I can imagine it being super tasty if I were drinking a beer.",

The place was packed but the wait time from ordering food to getting it to eat was pretty quick turnaround.   Definitely worth going with a bunch of people so you can explore the menu together.",

    "text": "As though the food on strip wasn't decadent enough, this tiny restaurant packs an enormous amount of flavor in every savory dish. This was my second Vegas visit where our team incorporated Carson's- and it won't be our last.  We waited about 15 minutes before they were able to seat us. No big deal, we cozied up to the outdoor fire pit, and laughed, drinks in hand. Upon being seated, our server set us up with a fresh round of drinks. I had been elected to place our tables order. (This is trouble) There were seven of us, so we ordered a ton: Fried chicken skins: ok, hear me out on this one. I'm fully aware that chicken skins are the least healthy party of the chicken, but equally, they may be the most delicious. Especially when you deep fry them, and serve them with a smoky honey. (I love honey!) Three different burgers: butter, bison, not sure the last. that we cut like a pizza and shared. The sweet potato tater-tots were a table wide hit. Bacon Jam (this is an epic dish of bacon, some fruit, and Brie that you spread on crispy bread slices). Highly addictive. Completely unhealthy, totally worth it. Spicy shrimp: crispy and coated with a spicy mayonnaise, these were a popular, rich treat. Truffle Mac and cheese: mind blown- this was amazing. Unsurpassed deliciousness coated in cheese and baked to nice brown top.  Braised pork belly: this was a close second to the Mac and cheese. Very close. It was succulent, tender, flavorful and I had more than my fair share ;) Tri-color cauliflower: this was tangy and a wild adventure. Also, the healthiest thing we ordered. Gyro-tacos: sounded weird, but these were superb. Flavorful meat, and the prefect tzatziki sauce. Wild mushroom flatbread: perfectly crisp, great portions of toppings and yummy! I was a few Tito's and cranberry in, so I'm not sure if I missed anything else. I feel like I may have excluded something. Oh, then dessert. Bread pudding Bacon Icecream. (Never had anything close) The chocolate cake, also amazing.  As you can gather from reading the above, we enjoyed everything, and still kept eating. Tales of my dietary trespasses here will forever be told- and I'm not ashamed of any of them! Highly recommend this off strip gem!",

The bartender hustles but we never felt rushed or neglected.  The whole main floor is pretty tight but it allowed us to visit with other diners and make friends!  We had the rabbit ragu, roasted tomato stack and baby beets. They were all fantastic! If I recall, the entrance isn't right on 6th Street but I'm directionally challenged.  Wait staff was friendly and efficient. Nice addition to downtown Vegas!  There was a party of three vulturing at the bar and tried to grab our neighbors seats at the bar when they left for a few minutes to check out the upstairs section.  If you're wound tight like that....don't go. It's bad energy, man.",

The mac and cheese melts in your mouth... But the shrimp.... it was THEE best shrimp I ever had in my life. I think it changed my life for the better lol. The bacon jam was such an original dish I have to rank it high. I never tasted anything like it before. My favorite was the tempura style green beans. There was a woman at the bar chocking and a guy ran from the kitchen and saved her life. It was the most excitement that occurred for me during my stay in Vegas lol. If you are in Vegas, I highly recommend you try it out. They place is small so you need to call ahead to get on the list.  Bon Appetit",

The bacon Brie jam was one of the best things I've tasted in my life. I honestly wouldn't order a burger or entree here (not that it would be bad) because the food is do good it's a great idea to get a few things and share to try all the different flavors.

    "text": "Two Words-So Good!!  A new gem to the downtown corridor. This restaurant by Chef Kerry Simon takes comfort food to the next level!  Started off with a few of the shareable plates. If you don't care about your waist line or your cholesterol levels, start with the crispy chicken skins. They have taken the best part of fried chicken and made it an appetizer!  The Wellington empanadas are amazing!  The beef inside is so flavorful and tender.  Next we had the tempura green beans. The beans were so fresh and the tempura was the perfect crispiness/saltiness. Don't forget to dip in the cream cheese sauce. Next was the veal meatballs with sherry foie gras cream sauce. Again heaven. Taking down home comfort food and jazzing it up a notch. Did I mention we sat at the chefs counter and were able to talk to the entire kitchen staff while they prepared our meal!  It was like being on a cooking show. For our main course, we had the short rib sliders and the baked Mac and cheese. Again amazing comfort food taken to the next level. The short ribs have a root beer glaze that is a perfect compliment to the braised beef. I've been dying to try the Mac and cheese since the day I saw a pic of them on FB a few months ago and it was so worth the wait!   As stuffed as we were, we still tried the Bourbon Fudge Brownie with brown butter bacon ice cream. And we were so happy we did. The ice cream had actual bacon bits in it!  Paired with the decadent chocolate brownie, the saltiness/creaminess of the ice cream was what God must have intended heaven to taste like :)  I will definitely be coming back with lots of my friends in tow!",

I absolutely could eat the watermelon & feta salad and tempura green beans all day. Skip the buffets and come here instead.",

    "text": "Carson Kitchen embodies the spirit of the new downtown Las Vegas to the fullest.    The dining room; Just like DTLV is trying to create a sense of community, this restaurant is bringing a style of dining I have yet to see in Las Vegas, family style dining. This type of dining encourages conversation between complete strangers and usually ends up creating an atmosphere welcoming to all. An atmosphere some may say is similar to that of DTLV.    The food; DTLV is a place where trends come to be seen, the same can be said for Carson Kitchen for food trends. However, instead of being safe with food trends, they take trends and put their own twist on them. For example, they have fried chicken skins with their own spicy honey sauce, oxtail risotto, and bacon jam. All of which were delicious and simply addicting, especially the bacon jam (believe the hype).   There is not much more to say, this place is fantastic and should definitely be on everyone's radar.",

The food was creative and my favorites of the evening were the chicken skins, bacon jam, flatbread and sweet potato in a jar. The weather prohibited us from eating at the rooftop dining area but will try that next visit.  Two suggestions: 1) adding the name of the restaurant (maybe a reflective steel grey) on the second window on the top as the other signage is blocked by parked cars and the black text is hard to read and 2) hooks for purses.  If you enjoy creative food and a pleasant atmosphere this is a place to seek out. Thank you GM Matt Harwell for your hands on style.",

Not terrible service but did hinder the experience. Service aside , we were so impressed with the food that the it didn't matter however wouldn't return due to service. It is definitely worth going to on food alone.",

    "text": "Visiting Carson Kitchen was on my \"must do\" list for my next trip to Vegas.  A group of four of us arrived a little after 11am so there was no waiting.  We had the empanadas which were a disappointment.  The flavor was odd or off, unappetizing -- maybe it's the mushrooms.  One of the empanadas was half filled with gristle & fat which the eater spit out onto her plate.  We debated sending the dish back, hard to do when it comes with 4 bites and everyone took one.  We had the bacon jam which was good, make sure to get the extra toast. Then we had devil eggs which were average, not notable in any way except for a little caviar.  Beet salad which was fine.  The tomatoes in the stacked salad were not ripe -- something you might buy at cheap grocery store.  I know it's not quite tomato season, but the bland, hard meat of the tomato spoiled the dish.  The short rib sliders which were superb with with sweetly root beer sauce (and tater tots on the side).  I could probably eat these every day.  This would be my go-to item.  The mushroom flat bread was very good.  The gyros soft tacos were over salted.  The service was wonderful.  The scores for the food were 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 5, 4, 3, for an average a little over 3.  Very uneven food.  The rating should be 3.5.  Somewhere between \"A-Okay\" and \"I'm a fan\".  If we had had only the sliders, bacon jam, and flat bread we might have been looking a 5 star rating.  The service makes we want to push the rating to 4, but the empandas and tomatoes make me want to keep it at three.  The food will win.  3 stars.",

Deciding to share, we ordered a few different things; German potato salad, shrimp and grits, the steak with reduction and the crispy chicken skin with smoked honey.   The German potato salad had decent flavor but was overly salty. The chicken skins were indeed crispy with a slightly spicy dusting. The smokiness of the honey was lost when paired with it's intended vehicle, but on it's own, it's fantastic. And surprisingly strong. The shrimp and grits was by far the best dish. Spicy, flavorful, it's a shame there wasn't more of it. The steak was meh, but I appreciated that it was rare, as I requested. The coffee flavor was lost and the reduction was flavorless- making the entire piece of meat unmemorable. I swished the meat around in it a few times to try to find something and got nothing.  If I had a choice, I wouldn't be back. And for the hype this establishment has received, it definitely did not live up to it.",

The salmon was our 4th dish and tasted a bit bland and all the flavor was in the crispy skin. I wouldn't get that again. Even though we were not going to linger and had a show to go to, we still felt rushed. Things like your plate being removed the second you put down your fork, not being asked if we wanted another drink and the next set of diners standing in the doorway scanning the tables all added to it. It's a small place that needs the turnover so I get it. Not a big deal but something to keep it in mind when you go there. YMMV.",

Entree was $14 and was wayyyyyyy better than a much more expensive entree I'd had elsewhere the night before, so come here for good beer, energetic but good ambiance, and delicious, reasonably priced food.",

Their caviar topped deviled eggs were fluffy and decadent with awesome bacon flavor.

    "text": "A restaurant is judged not only by the food they put out but also by the service they provide. Tonight I was super excited to try out Carson Kitchen. I left unimpressed and actually a bit offended by the waiter's service.   Initially, the night started off alright. He introduced himself (I forgot his name) and was attentive enough. He gave us waters and recommended that we get about 2 plates/person as this restaurant mainly has small plates that are meant to be shared. We followed his advice and ordered 6 plates total. Halfway through the meal, the service started going downhill. We had 4 plates of food still on our table when he asked us if we were doing okay/if we wanted to order. 6 plates is a lot of food, so we said we were good and didn't order. He came back at least 2 more times while we were having our savory dishes to ask if we wanted to order more. That's a little overkill, especially considering that we already got his recommended amount of plates. When we wanted to order dessert, he was nowhere in sight, and we ended up having to wave at him from across the room. And then he tried pushing for us to try all three desserts. Dude, we're full. He also kept asking us if we wanted more than iced water. I think after the second time of telling him that we were okay with just water, he would get the hint. At the very end of the meal, he also gave us attitude when we asked if we could split the bill three ways. Honestly, he could have easily just told us no and been done with that. There are apps like Venmo; I can work around not being able to split a bill. Instead, he made the rest of the night super awkward as he hovered over us as we tipped him with the portable credit card machine.   We ordered: crispy chicken skins - one of the better dishes of the night. You can't go wrong with fried food, and the smoked honey is a nice accompaniment. bacon jam - They put a lottttttt of balsamic vinegar in this; it was a little too tangy for me. I would put more cheese to balance out the vinegar. It has also an odd texture and reminds me of diced up Asian beef jerky. black rice and oxtail risotto - They advised to mix the dish up thoroughly before eating. There was a familiar taste to it, but I couldn't place a finger on it. It was alright....  baked mac and cheese - They have a pretty sharp cheese in that blend of whatever cheeses they use. It's nice. They also browned the top with some breadcrumbs; the added crunch was a nice change in texture green, eggs, & ham - It smelled of smoky deliciousness. The eggs were overcooked so we couldn't \"spread the egg\" to the other pieces of flatbread, like we were advised. However, it also smelled exactly like the wild mushroom flatbread from the table next to us; so I'm going to assume that they taste also similar' glazed donut bread pudding - this was the star of the night. Get this.  Despite the chicken skins and the dessert, the service I experienced today makes it difficult to want to ever come back. 3 stars for food; -1 star for the awful awful service",

My friend met a guy on one of those dating apps and didn't want to meet him alone (bc serial killers are a real thing). SO, she asked us to come (but obvi we sat at a different table). Jessica & Viv - The dynamic duo who will keep an eye on you from a distance to make sure you're safe!!   Here's what we ordered: grilled artichoke, short rib grilled cheese, and turkey burger.   Is it just me, or are whole artichokes really hard to eat? Like I'm eating leaves and I don't know if I'm doing it right. Well how where I did it, I ate it and it was good. A lot more flavorful than I expected.   The grilled cheese, turkey burger, and tater tots were good, but not so memorable. For $14 a burger, I'd probably just rather buy 3 double doubles at in n out.",

At least my wife and I were able to get drinks and hang around their outdoor area in the back.  The whole thing was quite an eye opener for me.  Who would have thought even 5 years ago that something like this would be thriving on 6th St and Carson???  Amazing!  The dining area was a little cramped but still maintained a cool vibe.  The open kitchen, bustling servers and unique seating area kind of enhanced the experience.  I wouldn't come with more than a party of 4 until their outdoor and upstairs areas are done.  Our server informed us those areas would be complete in about a week.  I'd classify the fare as \"New American\".  Kerry and his staff do some really interesting twists.  Their \"Wellington Empanada\" was a delicious way to start the meal.  I enjoyed their take on the typical empanada crust.  It was light with some crunch and soaked up the excellent sauce on the plate nicely.    My wife gasped when she saw they offered \"Crispy Chicken Skins\" and ordered it almost before our server got out the word \"hello\".  Breaded and deep fried chicken skin isn't exactly clean eating but holy shit was it awesome.  Maybe chicken skin really is the new bacon!  It was a glorious way to swiftly kick my diet right in the balls.  Both of us weren't really big on the smoked honey dipping sauce it came with and opted to use the rich empanada sauce instead.  We shared the \"Rabbit Ragu\" and the \"Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak\" done rare.  The rabbit was delightful and the sauce delivered a surprisingly spicy kick.  Thankfully, the spaghetti was made of squash.  I needed some vegetables after my mini guilt trip on the chicken skins :P The steak was a little more medium rare than rare but the sauce and light espresso flavor made up for it.  Can't wait to drink and dine outside next time!",

They now have a MMM Rib sandwich but without the best dill sauce ever it doesn't even compare. The other downside of Carson is that all the seating is either high tops or backless chairs so it's a hard place to take anybody with any physical limitations. I really hope they bring back the Burnt Ends or at least the dill/ranch dressing that came with it.",

A friend and I went out for his Birthday celebration something neither of us are able to do with having a family.    We were greeted and seated immediately seeing that it was senior citizen dinner time.  We sat at the bar and browsed there beer selection which was fantastic in my opinion. I like the craft beer choices and the prices were not too out of line.  The decor and style of the place is top notch.  Very well done and has a certain rustic elegance and modern feel to it. Very nicely done.    We went with the chicken skins for an appetizer with honey to dip and I was not disappointed at all by the choice.  They tasted like a BBQ potato chip.  The skin were seasoned so well wanted to lick my fingers but I had to refrain and wipe them on my nice cloth napkin.     For my main course I went with the Buffalo Chicken Flatbread.  I really like the blue cheese and buffalo sauce flavor combo of hot and creamy with almost a chopped chicken with slice carrots and celery.  I am not a fan of celery but this tasted like a buffalo chicken wing and had tons of flavor.    My friend decided on the Turkey burger which he said was packed full of flavor also.  He said it had hints of apple and also seasoned well and was really juicy which is something you do not always find in a turkey burger. They tend to be dry and overcooked.  This he said was perfect with his side of tater tots.  The food came out quickly to the table.  The beer selection was very good.  Carson Kitchen has thought what would go best with there menu choices.  Almost like the have done the beverage and food pairing for you.  I enjoy the craft beer offering's of IPA's and Porters and such.  I am also surprised that PBR is making a comeback in certain hipster circles.    This place is awesome. The food is amazing and a must try for Downtown.  If you want to impress someone on a date take them here and you will definitely enjoy your time together.",

    "text": "Carson Kitchen....  Here are the bullet points....  -New Downtown bar and restaurant -Open Kitchen  -Small, cramped, and loud.  NOTE:  there's an upstairs patio soon to be open -Great service with a big staff -Reservations if your party is 6 or more -Located next door to O Face Doughnuts -Apps:  Portions are small and pricey -The Food:  Portions are small and priced about right.   The gf and I came here on Friday night just about a week after they opened.  I thought that the service was great.  Our server gave us his recommendations, was very attentive, and he even gave us a quick tour.  As for the food, I enjoyed half of what I had.  I ordered their Wellington Empanada as an app and their Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak as an entree.  The empanada was a little too greasy and pricey at $10 for two small pieces.  The steak cost $18 and I thought it was worth it. It was delicious, sliced, and full of flavor. My gf had their Bacon Jam as an app and their Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto.  I got a little taste and thought both were pretty good.  Again, wasn't a fan of the price of their Bacon Jam, but thought that the entree was just about right.    Overall, don't let my 3 star review fool you.  3 stars from me means that they are just \"A-Ok\".  In other words, I don't see myself rushing back any time soon.  I do recommend other Yelpers to give them a try. TIP:  Tip regarding their Check-In...double check your receipt. We were charged for our \"Free\" item.  They fixed the issue...just saying.",

Very casual ambiance with family style seating.  The music is loud enough to be fun, but not so loud that you can't have a discussion.  The waiters understand their menue, and know about pairing with wine/beer to make the taste all the better.  I personally love the sharing menu/tapas style of dining this place offers, less stuffy and enables you to have a good connection with your party.    The food is awesome: the deviled eggs are a MUST have!!!  The Seabass is great, so is the steak.  They don't take reservations for under 6-people: we showed up at 6pm and did not have a wait.",

At  arrival we weren't greeted with a warm welcome. We were seated at a high top that seats about 6-10 people and requested to sit in a lower table. The place was very empty and the host sat us at a vertical two top. When me and my boyfriend requested to sit next to each other at a four top, she mentioned to us she wouldn't be able to seat us there because if there was a large party they would need the table. Take in mind this place was empty. When we sat at the two top, my boyfriend moved along the side and the server rudely told my my boyfriend he couldn't sit next to me! At that point we were so shocked and upset that we just ended up leaving.  First impressions are everything in any business, and this place has the worst hospitality. If their service was that bad, I can only imagine how they handle their food they serve.",

I didn't go upstairs, but in the downstairs dining area, you may be sitting next to strangers. It's cozy, not weird, I promise!   I honestly don't know what more to say other than, the service was great, the place was clean and the most important part (food, duh) was delicious with items that you may not be able to find as easily in other places.

    "text": "This place came highly recommended by a friend of mine who was a Las Vegas hotel concierge. I was looking for a hip spot with an eclectic menu that included options for two friends with a dietary restriction (they are vegetarians). When I looked at the menu at Carson Kitchen, I thought this was the perfect spot with lots of meat centric options and a large variety of veggie options as well. They were able to accomodate our party of six and seated us inside (I called two weeks in advance). I never got to see their outdoors area but I would imagine the ambiance is more fun than inside.   The only reason why I am giving Carson Kitchen three stars is because some of the dishes didn't live up to our expectations. The wild mushroom flatbread was oversaturated with some kind of barbecue sauce which is not listed at all on the menu so it was a little shock to the palate. The black rice and oxtail risotto was not good at all. That was sadly a disappointing dish. The crispy chicken skins were just o.k. After hearing so much about them, it was displeasing to find them so bland.  Now that I got that out of the way, I have to mention that the service was amazing. Everyone from the host to the server were great. Our drinks were on par and we had some really delicious dishes; bbq burnt ends, \"devil's\" eggs, tempura green beans, pig in a duvet, baked mac and cheese, and rainbow cauliflower. The absolute star of the show was the rainbow cauliflower.  Carson Kitchen, you win at service, drinks, and cauliflower.",

The tater tots that came with the hamburger were the best I've ever had. They sprinkled some kind of seasoning onto them that gave the tots just the right zing. Not spicy, but just a little kick if that makes sense. The address says it's on 6th but the entrance to the restaurant is on the intersecting street. Very convenient to anyone on Fremont Street. Would definitely return next time we're in Vegas. Dakota was our waiter and was very attentive to our needs.",

    "text": "The great things I've been hearing...THEY'RE TRUE!   I love that this place is tucked away. It's like a local secret. I went here for a late lunch and was seated immediately. Being only a party of two I'd feel bad taking a large table top so I went for a seat at the bat. Tentative bar service and quick amazing food. We got three appetizers because I really wanted to try a few things off the menu since other local friends were strongly encouraging me to try Carson Kitchen.   Let me start off by saying all the food looks just like the website photos. I love to eat with my eyes so I about fell out of my chair when I saw this delicious food coming toward me. First came the Bacon Jam. The guy that dropped it off suggested we get a piece of the Bree with every bite. It smelt a lot like BBQ sauce but as soon as touched my tongue, I was in love. Not to sweet at all, amazing flavor, and bacon. Nuff said.   Next came the Welington Empanadas. Flakey pastry, amazing flavor, sauce was a little bland but I saw it as more decorative because all the flavor was inside the empanada. Only two per order and only a couple bites. Not a heavy appetizer. I would recommend!   Finally, oh man, the Gyro Tacos. I seriously had to stop a staff that had nothing to do with our service and tell him how good they were. The tzatziki sauce didn't have too much dill in it like more authentic tzatziki WHICH IM TOTALLY OKAY WITH! Preferred in fact. Meat and cheese lay in little pitas that are easy to eat in a couple bites. I would recommend these for sure. Don't let the lamb scare you! Lamb is usually too tough for me unless shaved like in a typical gyro sandwich. The flavor is out of this word. I could seriously go on for days about those \"tacos.\"   Everyone was super friendly, it's so clean, hip and new. Take the time to hit up this spot in Downtown LV!",

We had the Bacon Jam everyone seemed k race in here and it for not disappoint.  The temperature was perfect and you could yell based on the serving dishes that this was well planned.  We also had the Rainbow Cauliflower which was delicious.  Many of the posters have said they didn't even like Cauliflower and found this to be awesome. We finished our meal with the NY strip steak which rivaled my top 5 steak experiences.  If you go with a bigger group you could probably try much more on the menu with their shareable menu.  The place is a block or two off the main run of Fremont street which made me wonder where the heck we were headed but we landed in food freaking heaven! Check it out l.",

With an ever changing menu, it's tough to make recommendations.  With that said, the beet salad was as good as I have had and the bacon relish/jelly is one of a kind. Oh and a great soundtrack full of energy!  Atmosphere is awesome.",

I highly recommend and for vegas it was very reasonably priced as well.",

    "text": "Great new addition to the DTLV dining scene! Had dinner with a party of 8 at CK so we got to try a lot of the menu. Overall, the food was really good. Some highlights were the tempura green beans, the mac & cheese, the deviled eggs, the bacon jam, and the broccoli. The mushroom flatbread and the beet salad were fine and the spam croquettes were very salty (but cleverly presented). The gyro tacos were tasty and filling. Service was solid - at times inattentive but it was pretty busy. Only real drawback was how loud it was. Music turned up too high. in sum, definitely recommend it.",

    "text": "So I went here the other with a group of friends. Between all of us, we got the Sunday fried chicken sandwich, black rice and oxtail risotto, Mac and cheese, beet salad, and beef sliders. The black rice and oxtail risotto is different from most other risotto I've had. I was not a big fan of the black rice because it reminded me of uncooked rice. And flavor was good though and the oxtail was tended. The chimichurri green stuff on the oxtail was a nice contrast to the creamy risotto sauce because it added a zesty kick. The beet salad was refreshing. The Mac and cheese had a strong truffle component which I liked. The beef slider were okay for me. A little too much on the sweet side. The Sunday fried chicken sandwich was good. The chicken was juice and the batter was the right amount of crispy. We also got the bourbon brownie for dessert. The brownie was not soft. It was too hard for me and too sweet. The ice cream had bacon bits so you either love or hate it.",
