    "text": "It was my first visit, and for lunch, but so far so bueno!  My hubby and I shared  the calamari appetizer and it was fabulous.  Served on a bed of rice (we opted for brown), and what appears to be prepared stir-fry style, the rings were cut into strips and breaded and tossed with sweet and sour style sauce.  Very light and a nice departure from the way calamari is typically served.  For lunch, I had the Tomatillo Chicken Enchilada off of the 650 calorie and under menu and it was honestly one of the best dishes I've had in a long while.  It was full of flavor, bright with lime undertones in the tomatilla sauce but what really kicked it up was the sriracha crema that was drizzled on top of the enchilada.  My hubby had the shrimp tacos, and although he said they were good, he ended up finishing off my food (for 650 calories, there was A LOT of food on that plate).  He said he'd definitely get it next time we go there.  Loved the atmosphere and feel of the place, it was open yet warm feeling and not overly loud.  Can't wait to go back to try out the drinks (James & Ginger, yes please!, or Coconut Mojito) and some more of the menu.  Another great addition to Downtown Summerlin.",

I think ill try another option next time.  On the other hand, the peach cobbler for dessert was oh so yummy.  Plenty to share with one or even two more people. The oatmeal topping was a standout.   A nice choice for dining in Summerlin Centre.",

The service is what led me to make this review. We had at least 5 different servers and it was all very slow. Worst service I've encountered in some time. With all the people running around I would have expected a lot more attention.",

    "text": "I have to say, I really gave this place a chance because I went here twice and both experiences, the food was an easy C-. First time around I ordered the spicy Thai chicken salad. When it arrived at the table, it looked like they had opened a store bought bag of $.99 mixed lettuce and mixed it up with salad dressing. Second time around I had the Turkey burger. It really was nothing to write home about, or recommend. The only plus side about this place is their craft beers are decent and my coconut mojito was really good once I got past the rotting pieces of mint floating around in my drink that I fished out with my spoon. However, I will give an A+ for my dog's food as she seemed to love it and I was very happy to find a place that we could bring her with a nice patio. Unfortunately, not happy enough to come back a 3rd time because the food quality here is lacking. I wanted to like this place, so much so, we gave it a second chance. Maybe they should minimize their menu and focus on better food quality.",

    "text": "I would have given this place three stars, but added a star because of how dog friendly they are. It's just nice to see a place in town that does cater to people with dogs, with a big patio that is dog friendly. There was quite a bit of people waiting with their dogs to be seated on the patio, which was fun to see. And while I didn't LOVE this place, I would return with my dog as I think she would like it there. This restaurant is just OK. Given all of the other amazing dining options we have in town, I'm just not sure this is a place I'd want to return to again and again. Got the tuna poke for the appetizer, which was good. Then I ordered the pesto chicken with hummus salad, which was just ok and honestly something I could have gotten at an Applebee's. There is just nothing particularly amazing or different about the menu selections or quality of food to make this place stand out. Again, I would have given it a 3, but any place that is dog friendly makes me more of a fan ...",

The food was very good and great quality and this means a lot coming from a picky eater like myself.  I started with the peach sangria that was perfectly sweet but not too sweet. They comped me a flatbread since it was my first visit. That was a very nice gesture and it was a perfect texture with light cheese and garlic, very tasty.  For my entree I enjoyed their chicken stir fry with hot and sweet sauce and brown rice.  The flavors were perfect and the cuts of chicken were good quality.  I was perfectly satisfied with my meal, but couldn't pass up dessert, so I went for their house made butter cake. It was nothing short of heavenly and topped off with vanilla ice cream.  In addition, the service was very good and I enjoyed my experience.  I highly recommend this place as it has a great menu selection, very quality food and a dog friendly patio!  I will definitely return!",

The nuggets were plump, tasty and served on a bed of blue cheese Cole slaw, never had that before and was pleasantly surprised. Wings were 7/10 and pizza was good but was wishing for something a lil more crispy 7/10. My wife's ahi tuna was 6/10. The greens, tomatoes and olives were tasty however the tuna was fishy but edible. Service was sluggish at the beginning but came up to speed as appetizers were arriving, mostly due to game night I'd imagine. I drank house ipa, it was tasty but not as hoppy as I like. Overall experience was 7.5/10! We will come back...",

The second time there was a noticeable difference in the amount of pulled pork on the sandwich, I thought to give it another try... Tonight I left hungry. It felt like I was eating bread and BBQ sauce more than anything. I ate less than half. Very disappointed. Especially when my girlfriend let me know her salad was overdressed and soggy.

My husband obviously did not read the menu as to all the ingredients in his salad. When it came it had cucumbers, mint and cilantro, three items he does not like. He ate it but Lisa could read his face and new he wasn't a happy camper. She asked him what was wrong and he took responsibility for his poor judgement. We had also ordered the artichoke on the special menu and it seemed to be under cooked, so she took it off our bill. Lisa then brought us their Butter Cake to make up for his disappointment. It definitely put a smile on his face. Overall the experience was great! They made good on everything and that is what taking care of the Cutomer is all about!",

I came with a group of coworkers for lunch and despite making a reservation well in advance they had nothing prepared for us so we were left to wait for the table to be set up which took about 15 minutes. We had a limited time for lunch so we were nervous about this slow start.   Finally seated slow service plagued the meal. Our server was nice but given that they assigned her our entire table of twelve along with a few surrounding tables. A little too much for her to handle so although we understood she was trying her best we needed to address the issue and hopefully get some help to expedite our meal. After speaking with the manager we noticed many more servers and bussers helping out with refills and bringing out the food. This should have happened before we asked but we appreciated the effort.   The food was bland and boring as on my previous visit and along with all the service issues, I really don't see any need to return.",

    "text": "I went here based on Yelp reviews and as usual, fellow yelpers did not let me down.   The restaurant is located in the new downtown area.    Upon entering I was greeted by two friendly hostesses and offered to sit either inside or outside.  The wait was 45 minutes.  There were plenty of seats at the bar so We sat at the bar.    The inside of the restaurant has a great atmosphere and I personally love the decor. It's a combination of wood and stone. There are cool metal sculptures of dogs and some other animals in the place.    The bartender was awesome.  He made some recommendations regarding the local beer selection. He was more than willing to provide some samples if we were not sure how a particular beer would taste. Based on his recommendations I went with the bad beat beer and was not disappointed.  Obviously beer is personal and what I like, others may not like.    After what seemed like a short wait, we were escorted to a table.   Jennifer, the waitress, quickly greeted us and brought some waters for the table.  She was just awesome.  Incredibly friendly and willing to help us in any way possible.    For an appetizer we ordered the spinach dip and edamame.  Both were excellent but everyone agreed the edamame had a little too much salt.  They were dusted with a spicy run with sesame seeds.  It really gave a nice kick to the edamame but had just a little too much salt.    For dinner I went with the chipotle chicken.  I was a little concerned that the chipotle part was a chipotle cream.  I asked Jennifer if I could have it on the side.  Her response was the kitchen will make any meal the way I want it.  That impressed me!!  Quite honestly I did not expect that.  I was glad I had it on the side.  For me, it would have been a little too heavy for the dish. I am not into heavy cream sauces on chicken.    Everyone at the table enjoyed their respective meals.  Everyone agreed the meals had great flavor, were cooked perfectly and everything on the dish had separate flavors and did not taste bland.    I didn't have any dessert but a lot of people at other tables were eating the butter cake.    Overall a great place and the price was great.   Very reasonable.   I would definitely come back.",

Salad was an extra $2.95 and we split it -- holy cow the split portions were enormous! I would never have been able to finish a full salad! See my pics. Everything came out very fast. Very cheesy and yummy.    Reasonably priced and very nice dining environment.  Huge menu with lot of variety and the back page has great healthy meal options. We shall return!",

    "text": "I've frequented the Lazy Dog Summerlin location not necessarily for myself but to spoil my dog and who doesn't love their dog?   ATMOSPHERE: I've only sat outside, as this is where your to be seated with your dog. I actually really like the outdoor area, there's a nice fire pit in the middle and TVs mounted as well. Plenty of tables, the wait is never too bad. Nice place to have brunch with your family.   FOOD: One word. Mediocre.  I've tasted too many things here and while I can appreciate that lazy dog is trying offer a menu full of variety and it lacks flavor. Tried the nachos, plain, bland, and not enough toppings.  Tried the oven baked pancake, someone should tell whoever came up with this idea a pancake shouldn't be baked, it sticks to the pan they bring it in and is flat. The one decent dish here I would suggest would be the fish and chips, nothing special but the fish is always cooked just right. Also definitely try non-alcoholic drink creations here I really appreciate that part of their menu. Love the pineapple coconut water drink, perfect for the Vegas heat.  CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Hit and miss, I've had awesome waitors and oblivious ones. It does getbusy here on weekends and they seem overwhelmed at times. I don't like to bash people because we never know what's going on behind the scenes. I love that it's pet friendly, my dog has never gotten sick from the food and that's why I return.   Overall, if your looking for a casual day out with your pet and family I'd recommend this spot. If your not with your pet and looking for a nice dish, there's better options in Downtown Summerlin.",

    "text": "Woof Woof! Man's best friend can now go on a date with you.  No matter where I am, I love to try new places even if they've been there for a while. Luckily, this place just opened in Downtown Summerlin.   Met my human friends here for a get together dinner. Like all Yelpers, I turned to Yelp to provide me with the important details of a place. After looking over all the essential pieces for planning a dinner, I screenshot the location with address to them.   We showed up without a reservation but the wait wasn't too long. We were seated inside near the fireplace. Talk about warm and cozy with your friends. Our server Laura was awesome! We were all about a few under by this time of night and very glad to have a server who could roll with our humor and craziness. Since it was everyone's first time eating at Lazy Dog, we were very dependent on her suggestions. She gave us a few minutes to look over the menu and would come back to take our beverage order.   The guys ordered the Lazy Dog House sampler. The best way to try their house brews without going under the table before dinner. I had the Rum Barrel Punch and my girlfriend ordered the Snow Cap. The guys were satisfied with the sampler. They really liked the Blonde Ale. I liked my rum punch and after tasting the Snow Cap, I think I would order that next time. It's very similar to drinking iced coffee with Kahlua.   Laura was back and ready to take our order. Sorry, we will still need more time...but we will order some small plates to start. We placed an order of the Hush Puppies,  Caramelized Brussels Sprouts and Cajun Fries. The first two selections were Laura's suggestions. The Hush Puppies was basically a bite size baked potato. So good but be sure to cut it in half before eating. The insides were very (temperature) hot. If you are not a big fan of Brussels Sprouts then you might want to try it at Lazy Dog. You can hardly taste the Brussel sprout flavor. It is completely overpowered by the lemon, garlic, butter and capers. I love Brussel sprouts so it was too flavorful for me but it was a new way to try it.   We finally ordered our entrees...items that were ordered includes the slow-braised lamb shank, the bone-in pork schnitzel, and the chicken poblano. It seemed like our food came out in lightning speed. Talk about fall off the bone braised lamb shank. It was so juicy with the sauce and the mashed potatoes complimented it very well. If you have tried a schnitzel from Switzerland then you might want to visit the Lazy Dog. Their schnitzel isn't exactly like Switzerland's but it's darn close. Don't forget to squeeze the lemon to bring out a new flavor. The only part of the chicken poblano that I tried was the crispy corn cake that topped off the dish. Those little cakes are packed with a spicy kick.   Sweet & sinful ending to a wonderful dinner meant ordering the Butter Cake. This delectable dessert could make a man who normally doesn't eat dessert take a bite. The cake that is the foundation of the dessert is baked to perfection. This filling cake is topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. The best ice cream flavor ever! The strawberry compote is absolutely lovely and I wish they would pack it in a little mason jar and sell it.   It was a great night with friends at the Lazy Dog. Thank you Laura for an amazing experience!",

Not only did Lazy Dog provide a separate Gluten Free menu, but the Executive Chef, Juan was extremely attentive and interactive with the gluten free accommodations. We ordered nachos, buffalo cauliflower, brussel sprouts, tortilla soup, and the halibut. Everything was AMAZING. Our waiter, Daniel, was also awesome. Between the food and over the top staff, I would highly recommend this restaurant!!",

    "text": "We have a dog so we're always looking for dog friendly places to go. I signed up for their club and got a coupon for my birthday which is 2 days after our dogs birthday so we went to do a double celebration dinner for both of us. There were a few other dogs there when we arrived, when the hostess went to seat us 2 of the big dogs there barked and snapped at our dog who is not aggressive. So we asked to sit away from them in a nice quiet corner. They obviously don't enforce the \"rules\" they advertise because the group with the two mean dogs stayed about an half hour longer.  Staff was great, they loved our dog but unfortunately can't pet him because of food service rules. They gave him a bowl of water and we ordered him the Chicken and Brown Rice off the doggie menu. It was very rice heavy so he dug out all the chicken and left most of the rice behind. Lol! We started with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, not as good as PF Changs but tasty nonetheless. I ordered the Fish and Chips which was pretty meh, I wouldn't get it again. Doug got the Grilled Cheese and a bowl of the seasonal soup (Sausage, mushroom and brown rice). It was tasty. We got a beer flight of Lazy Dog beers to sample along the way, not bad. For dessert (ha ha) I got an Asian Pear Martini...yum! I would definitely get it again! Doug tried the Coconut Mojito, it was a waste of liquor, thumbs down. The food was pretty average but we like the atmosphere, drinks, and dog friendly patio. Will definitely go back and try it again.",

    "text": "I have known about Lazy Dog from back when I lived in California, but never got around to trying it. The husband and I were shopping at Downtown Summerlin on Mother's Day, and although we figured this place would be crowded, we decided to walk here and find out how long the wait was. 45-55 minutes. No thank you. Came back a week later and as we were parking, I was afraid the wait would be long again. The parking lot was packed for some reason and a lot of people were waiting outside. But I guess people were just hanging out. We walked in and hostess seated us at a booth right away.   Our server was attentive, but I didn't feel like he was too friendly. A manager also stopped by our table to ask how everything was going. The food was delicious! I ordered the Hawaiian Sticky Ribs, which was cooked perfectly and I loved the generous amount of sauce that was on it. Juicy and full of flavor to the bone! Honestly, I don't like to order ribs too often because most places never prepare them right. It annoys me when they are dry and barely have sauce on them. It also came with Umami Fries, which had a kick to it, but it was good. I could have done without the asian slaw on the plate, which was really soggy and bland. My husband ordered the Country Chicken and Biscuit, which is part of their weekend brunch menu. I didn't try it, but he said that it was one of the best chicken and biscuit dishes that he had. We didn't leave any room for dessert, but definitely next time because the Butter Cake does look good!  I would like to come back again to try different dishes. I like the wide variety of food that they have to offer. Also think its cool that you can bring your dogs to dine with you on the patio, along with a dog menu!",

Had to take a star off because this place does NOT take reservations unless it's for 7 or more people. Come on people, that is ridiculous and a turn off for those of us who like to plan ahead.",

Very well priced and plates were very healthy.   My cup was never empty and the service is more than 5 star. I wish I could give them more stars.  THis is for sure my go to place.

With that being said, there was still a lot of bodies inside the joint.  Our little two person was on the fringe of the bar area and the main dining area.  A possible \"no man's land\" in other locations but not here.    Our server was very attentive and patient as we checked out the menu. I enjoyed checking out the modern lodgey feel of the place. He rolled by multiple times and I never detected any attitude, even after the third time.    After the fourth time, we were ready to order.  I had the \"Maggie's Snake River Salad.  Which I found to be very tasty.  It consisted of bacon, goat cheese, cranberries, tomatoes, walnuts and a balsamic vinaigrette.  The GF ordered up a lemon-capper chicken.  It was also delicious!  Together we ordered up some Cajun fries. The chipotle ranch dipping sauce was nice compliment.  Sure, there were tasty and healthy selections on the menu. I look forward to coming back again and getting down and dirty on a \"cheat\" day.  Hence the name...you can bring your four legged friend or family member and enjoy a special section of the menu outside with them!",

There were several tables in the bar that were not bussed because the busser was too busy talking to someone. We waited there for someone to bring us menus and take our drink orders but no one ever came. Eventually the server who told us to sit in the bar area came with menus, but she gave them to the people sitting next to us who arrived there after we did. Then she brought ours. We decided to leave. I doubt we will return.",

    "text": "So I come here to try their Home Cooked food and surprisingly I didn't feel like vomiting  I ordered the Chicken Tortilla soup  and I was pleasantly surprised.  It was actually really good. Good chunks of chicken breast the avocado was firm yet supple to the bite and the broth was a good clear consistency filled with bites of Tomato , cheddar cheese and tortilla strips. So I ordered the fish and chips and instead of fries I got mashed potatoes because nothing says home cooking like homemade mashed taters.  And this creamy Apple vinegar coleslaw was surprisingly delish! Creamy in all the right places without being overbearing it sweet. The acid of the vinegar balanced it all out and kept each bite as pleasant as the next.  My friend ordered the chicken pot pie and next to my own it was also a surprise. A huge round helping of pot pie perfectly built so all bites keep a good amount of edible warmth. I had to have two bites ! I got the loaded hush puppies but it was too much mashed potatoes not enough puppy for me. It's a bit misleading because there is no bread like texture however that's my error for not reading thoroughly enough.  It was too much potatoes on potatoes.  So dinner was not a disaster lastly we ordered the Butter Cake ! House made butter cake topped with a minted strawberry compote & vanilla bean ice cream garnished with sweet balsamic.  Ok so the butter cake and ice cream are to die for. Now me coming from the land of derby I'm picky with where mint intermingles with other organic natures.  The strawberry mint compote was a tad overwhelming.  The balsamic seemed pointless I can see they wanted it to cut through the richness of the cake and ice cream however it clashes.  A strawberry lemon compote with a different component would have been nicer however we still destructed the whole thing. When I first walked in I was angered they seated us and for 5-7 minutes no one came to get us drinks.  I explained to our server Sarah that I was pretty upset and throughout the whole dinner she was pretty, pleasant and polite. Her demeanor totally helped calm me down and helped me to better enjoy my meal. She truly cares about her customers and it shows!   She is definitely the kind geared towards management.  Thanks Sarah! I'll ask for your every time I come back and we will be back! How can we not have our friends try the goodies you have to offer :)  Everyone Ask for Sarah she's amazing! Truly!",

    "text": "Lazy Dog is one of our favorite restaurants. I actually trained as a server for a couple weeks, but unfortunately my other job was too demanding. They really have their stuff together there. The food is AMAZING---you can't go wrong with any choice! The atmosphere is nice, the bar is pretty cool, and the patio is super nice where you can bring your dog. Kiana (not sure of the spelling) is seriously one of the best servers we've ever had; we've had her a couple times and she is awesome! She seriously had half of this huge part of the restaurant all to her self and she was still great!! We'll always ask for her when we go. Some of our favorite menu items are the All American burger, the black and bleu pizza, the sweet and spicy shrimp, the hatch chile mac n cheese, the Tex Mex salad, and the butter cake for dessert is to die for! The Asian pear martini and the sangrias are also so good!",

He made us feel welcomed like and comfortable. Te little gesture of helping my brother take his jacket off was very impressive. He continuously walked around and made sure everyone, not only our table, was having a great experience. He even offered to turn off the fire place because we had long sleeves and what not on. The food is good. We had the chicken nachos, wings and tuna poke to start all were very delicious. The nachos are a big portion. we were full off of the appetizers. We ordered the lamb shank with mashed potatoes it was yummy! the lamb was so soft and juicy it literally melted in your mouth. The make your own pizzas on the kids menus take  a little longer so i recommend starting it right before or around the time you start appetizers. I love the fact that any burger can be substituted with a turkey burger. Over all the ambiance is great, the food is delicious, the customer service is always great.",

We ordered our food then noticed everyone who ordered after us were served their food. Our waitress finally came to our table and said she said, \"I'll check on our food\" (45 minutes after we ordered). When she returned to our table with our food she blamed the kitchen and said they messed up on our order. Then she said I'll get you a discount, knowing she knew the food was not edible. Our food was cold and burnt. We could not eat it so we waited another 10-15 minutes for her to check in with us. We told her we cannot eat the food and why. She did not apologize nor asked if she could replace it with edible dishes. She actually said,\"I'll take care of the check.\" We got up and left. We will not be returning to Lazy Dog anytime soon.",

Happy hour was going on-- which has select drinks, beers, and food items at lower prices. I tried the 6 beer sampler (only 6$ during happy hour). I personally liked the IPA the best, and the hefe the least. But that's my personal opinion. My mom and aunt got cocktails. The Asian pear cocktail is very refreshing.  We got some fried deviled eggs to start. They were served fresh and warm. Good mix of sweet and savory with the candied bacon on top. I got the Baja burger (their burgers are 1/2 pound) and cajun fries to go with my beer. I ordered it medium rare, and they cooked it perfect. It was a little messy (what with the guac and stuff), but most good burgers are. Everything was served hot and fresh. The rest of my party seemed happy with their choices as well. I was definitely full at the end.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time (officially) as a diner recently, right after the Breast Cancer Walk, that was held in front of Red Rock Casino.   Had been to their sister restaurant previously with another friend once, to pick up food for her doggy. This is a unique restaurant as it is one of the few that allows dogs (outside patio only) with a small menu for dog's. Of course there are some rules to follow but hey, easy enough if you have them trained well.   The restaurant opened at 0900AM on Sunday which was 2 hours earlier than it usually does on weekdays, and 1 hour earlier than it does on Saturday.   There was a few parties from the same walk here already when we had arrived. We were a party of 12 so i thought we'd have some trouble in getting some seating arranged. They had asked us if we had a reservation, when i answered \"no\", the hostess had a mild disappointment/sad emotion but stated it would take 10 - 15 minutes for our table to be ready. That in itself was really surprising and we were happy. Indeed, we were seated in 10 - 15 minutes. Surprisingly, we weren't the largest party in the restaurant.   We were greeted by our server (Gerardo) fairly quickly and had drinks served. One of our friend's had a yelp check in offer for free fries. 4 of us had checked in and did not see this offer. Not sure why? I have heard about some offers being random so i just left it at that. One of my friends had asked the waiter about this and he said he would ask his manager about it. A few minutes later, we had told us manager had allowed 2 more orders for us.  Cajun Fries - Crispy french fries with cajun seasoning and a side of chipotle ranch dipping sauce   YUMMY ! When we had originally got that 1st plate, the fries were disappearing fast. I decided to move the fries back to the person who ordered it before it disappeared in front of us. These fries are DANGEROUSLY DELICIOUS ! (i dont say this much). When 2 more orders came, we went at it. Very well seasoned. Deliciously crispy and well made. That dipping sauce wasn't even needed ! Best cajun fries i've ever had !   Hair of the Dog Bloody Mary - Vodka, tomato juice, black pepper, fresh lime + horseradish, garnished with olives, pickled green beans + celery  This was the brunch cocktail i had picked. I haven't had a bloody mary in ages and thought it was worth the try at the cost of $5. Pretty good pricing. Granted it was smaller than what i've seen what other restaurants offer but it was still fairly decent sized. I tasted the vodka and tomato juice, and some lime (since i squeezed that wedge of lime into my drink). Black pepper, horseradish was indistinguishable. Celery was a bit weird XD Surprisingly the pickled green bean was tasty. I don't really like olives but i ate that anyway XD (asian habits of not wasting food). As for the drink itself, eh. Was ok. I think there are better versions.   Was pretty indecisive with what i wanted to order. Not much of a breakfast/brunch fan typically so didn't really know what to order. Especially from the Brunch menu  Country Chicken + Biscuit - crispy fried chicken, housemade chicken sausage, two sunny side up eggs, housemade buttermilk biscuit, cajun gravy, spiced maple syrup  Aside from this one, i had my eyes on the housemade carnitas + tater tot hash. Some other friends ordered it and it looked really good. The country chicken and biscuit was ok. The biscuit was pretty yummy. The housemade chicken sausage was not that good. Less \"bite\" than i had expected from a sausage. The fried chicken was mildly dry and definitely wasnt crispy anymore. The gravy was good to mop up with the biscuit. Couldn't really tell the maple syrup was spiced or any different from a normal syrup. XD  My friend had ordered the pork fried rice. It includes smoked bacon, pork sausage, veggies + cabbage, topped with an egg omelette. The fried rice was very typical from an american establishment. Includes shredded carrots, and peas... Lol the rice was a bit undercooked and hard. The omelette is the weirdest part of all. Ok omelette on top of fried rice. Doesn't sound that weird right? But this omelette... was like... a dry quiche, without all the unique characteristics of a quiche and ingredients.. It seemed like it was thrown in a round pan and thrown into an oven for a long period of time... or even worse, microwaved. WORST \"OMELETTE\" EVER !   Price wise for the brunch items, was very good. Most items were under $10, which was quite cheaper than most things on their main menu.   Best item we had was the fries definitely. Service was great as well. My water was always filled quickly. Very attentive server (Gerardo). Weird that he asked to make a review with him in it but hey, he did do a good job. So it was deserving. If anything, this helped me notice his name and be able to recall it in this review. HAHA works out i guess.   Overall, decent place. Good service. Hopefully other food is better XD I'd like those fries again though. om nom nom",

Last time I went to Lazy Dog and saw people sitting INSIDE, I almost ran through the restaurant screaming \"Do you know what is just outside those doors???? Puppies! Dogs! Furry creatures! Why are you not outside giggling over the cuteness of all the doggos?!\"   Our four legged friends get their own menu at Lazy Dog (chicken or burger with brown or white rice btw) and these guys love it! Also, watching my Goldendoodle ( @boomgoesthedoodle on Insta) impatiently await the arrival of his burger, as his head whips around each time a server passes him by, makes me say, \"Same.\"  Oh, right, they also serve people food. Everything is prepared from scratch (no frozen bagged fries here) and all in all, it's a solid meal. They're good about customizing and have a nice happy hour.  If you need some stress relief and a solid meal, get a table on the patio and pet a few pups.",

    "text": "I really like the concept of this restaurant. I love furry friends and I appreciate that Lazy Dog welcomes them on the patio. That way, you won't have to be separated!   My friends and I came here this past Sunday for brunch. We had just finished the Breast Cancer Walk so we were pretty tired and hungry. There is a yelp check in offer for cajun fries .. if you're lucky enough to see it pop up on your yelp app. It popped up for one of our friends but the rest of us did not get the offer. However, our server, Gerardo, was nice enough to get two extra orders for us.  The cajun fries were delicious! They were a little on the thicker side -- sort of reminded me of frites. And they were seasoned so well! They also came with a dipping sauce but honestly, you don't really need it. It is definitely a dish worth trying.   There is a brunch menu for Sundays and it lasts until 2 PM. On the other side of the menu, there are $5 cocktails just for brunch! They have sangria, mimosa, peach bellini, bloody mary, and micheladas. I decided to go for a peach bellini -- I mean, why not?! Peach juice with a small bottle of champagne! It was decent but I have to say that I do prefer the frozen version better.   As for my meal, I decided to go for their pork fried rice: it has BACON, pork sausage, carrots, peas, and cabbage with an omelette on top. It was a HUGE portion and I definitely didn't finish it. I had to take it home. Unfortunately, I did not really notice much pork sausage in the fried rice but there was definitely bacon. It went quite well with the rice. The rice itself was kind of dry so it was kind of hard. The dish also needed more flavor...the bacon could only do so much. It also looked two-toned. The dish wasn't really prepared that well -- I think they used soy sauce but they didn't use enough to cover the whole dish .. either that or they just poured soy sauce into it but did not bother to mix it. The omelette on top? Ugh. Overcooked and looked like it was prepared in a microwave. I prefer my egg to be mixed in with my fried rice.   I think if they used enough soy sauce, used some ham (or maybe even spam) with the bacon, mixed the egg into the fried rice, add some green onions, add in sesame oil, and some garlic bits ...it would have turned out better. Oh and better rice ... they might have used rice that was too old.   Overall, I think their service is fantastic. Our server was nothing but helpful and was definitely on top of everything. As for the food, I was not that impressed with my dish so honestly, it's not really the type of place that I'd rush to come back to.",

With grandparents, my grown children, friends for brunch, friends for happy hour..etc.  You get the picture-it's one of my go to's.  It's been called bar food by my friend....but it's so much better than that!  Plenty of options for beer drinkers, liquor lovers, burger fanatics, vegetarian/vegans.  The menu is extensive without being overwhelming.    I'm finally writing a review because I love beets!  Ok, thanks for the info I'm sure you are saying, lol.  The new fall menu is out and there is a vegetarian dish-spaghetti squash with BEETballs.  Yes, beetballs-and they are so so good.  This particular visit I was with a chef and she ordered said dish.  She was so impressed by them that she was grilling the server on what was in them!  In the end she just ordered a bunch to go.  VEGANS ATTN-you can make this dish vegan by asking for no parm-romano on top-everything else is vegan-even the pesto.  I also had the beet salad.  Holy freaking yumm!  Roasted beets on burrata chesse with pistachios and a small green salad along side-I could have licked the plate it was that good!!  Crispy deviled eggs-this gets a line in my review all to itself-order them! im drooling thinking about them.   Other things that have been ordered and devoured- fish and chips, french dip, chicken nachos, BBQ bacon ranch burger, buffalo cauliflower, blistered green beans, buffalo chicken lollipops...  I'm dying to try the PB and J burger-I've heard good things about this combo but never tried!!  GASP!   I've just recently found out that they have a gluten sensitive chocolate cake!!  I am gluten sensitive but take risks-and then pay for them. SMH!  Don't bother with the mac and cheese...",

The menu on Yelp is so easy to use and order from and you can choose from take out or delivery (which is FREE). Most places charge a fee, or force you to oder a minimum amount, which can be annoying when you don't eat large portions and just want something small.   Anyway, I was looking for something without Gluten due to intolerance, and this place has an entire GF section, and I love and appreciate them for providing me with that peace of mind.   What I found was DELICIOUS, yet simple (and super cheap, if that's yo thang). A cup of the Chicken Tortilla Soup and a side of mashed potatoes left me satisfied AF.   So if you're in Vegas, check this place out, you will not regret it!   Thanks for reading :)",

Never had that before. Blistered beans had a citrusy tang which made you want to eat more. Lettuce wraps were peanutty and beet salad was fresh and delicious. The soup sampler was really tasty but we couldn't order a full serving. We had a lot of food already.  All in all - eat at Lazy Dog and ask for Lisa!  Great combination.",

His favorite menu item is the sticky ribs. They are good, Im just not much of a rib person. I've tried them, though and they taste a little sweet to me, which is interesting. The food is good. The wait to receive your food after you order is always long, which is an inconvenience to me because I have kids and they get restless after a while.  I added an extra star from my original post because I remember that every time I come here, the manager or someone in charge always ask how everything was. That's a nice touch I appreciate.",

Needless to say, I sat inside.  The food was just average pub food. Margarita Pizza, Fish Tacos, Fish & Chips, and Tofu Stir Fry. No need to go through each item. It was all average and over priced. The homemade ginger beer was good, but too sweet. I had to exchange it for an iced tea.  They have a cool bar with quite a few beers on draft. They also have a happy hour menu and the margaritas look good. I will probably be back to have a drink at the bar, but the food did not impress",

Next, I must say that Lazy Dog's in Summerlin has become our go-to restaurant. The food is great, the service is always excellent, the ambiance is pleasant and the prices are good.   And finally, kudos to the management team. You are either hiring wonderful people, training them really well, or both.",

My 11 year old son was with me and somehow started talking to one of the bartenders (Drea). He's totally a ladies man so I shouldn't be surprised!! Haha!  She came from behind the bar and was chatting it up with him. She totally entertained him and I thought it was pretty cool. She went out of her way to make sure he had a good time. And it wasn't for the tip, she wasn't even our server. Fin was great too. She explained everything we asked about on the menu and was patient with us when we couldn't decide. (The menu has SO much to choose from!). The food was out quickly and I had the grilled cheese (maybe the best ever) with Cajun fries (so yummy). My son had chicken fingers. He said they were delicious and they looked like they had been freshly breaded. The manager (I didn't get her name, taller with dark, curly hair) checked on us twice as well.  Bottom line. Food is great. Kitchen was fast and they really \"get\" great customer service. We'll be back for sure. Next time we'll bring the fur babies and try the patio!!",

Lunch was decent, I had the shrimp taco special while he had the blackened chicken bowl. The blackened chicken bowl was HUGE, but had a ton of mix-ins that made it really great. The chicken also had good flavor.   My shrimp tacos were pretty good, but came with a lot of plain slaw that could have used some dressing. They also came with a cup and a half of plain white rice. Next time I'd ask if they could swap it for Spanish rice. The blackened chicken bowl was the winner of the two.  For dinner I had the pot roast while boyfriend had the portobello burger. Hands down, the pot roast was the best I've ever had! It's super tender, comes with spinach, and garlic mashed potatoes. So good!  We also split the Lazy Dog flight to try their beers, all of which were good.  All in all, this place is great for a wide variety of food choices, decent (not overpriced!) prices, good atmosphere, and good beer.",

You could tell he was Happy to be there and proud of the food he served. The Manager Brooke was awesome as well. The food was off the hook good.

    "text": "We decided to come here right in the middle of the Sunday brunch rush on the first day of spring (3/20/16). The sun was out and it was about 80 degrees so we weren't surprised to see the crowd gathered in front of the patio/waiting area.  I decided to go in anyway to see what the wait was like.  The hostess asked if we wanted inside or outside, since we were dogless and was really just looking for a place for a quick bite and cocktail, I said inside.  She said the bar is open, self seating with full menu or we can wait about 10 min for a table in the main dining room.  I took the bar offer and realized there were plenty of seating inside, everyone just had their dogs so needed to wait to be sat on the patio.   The inside was still nice and had a good vibe so I was happy with not having to wait.  We started out with 2 orders of \"Hair of the Dog\" Bloody Mary's on the brunch menu ($5/each) and from the full menu ordered the 1/2 soup and salad.  The soups you get choose from is either chicken tortilla or the seasonal special which was cream of asparagus.  The salad you get the choice of is either Caesar, wedge or house greens.   When our lunches arrived we were surprised how big the portions were.  The salads were served on a good size plate and the soup was more of a bowl then a cup.  This soup/salad combo came out to $7.95 each with the exception of my boyfriends tortilla soup + avocado which $1 was charged.    This wasn't a big shock though since Chipotle charges .50 for guac and avocados can be pretty pricey. The bartenders were attentive and when we told her how surprised we were of the portion size she mentioned that everything is made from scratch also, you can't beat that!  I wouldn't say this was the most amazing food I've ever had, but I also wouldn't say this was the worse bar food I've ever had.  I really like the atmosphere (with or without a dog) the pricing, the service and the menu options.  I'll be back!  *now if they only had a place I could bring my cats.....",

A waitress sees me looking around while she's carrying a try full of drinks and stops over to ask if anyone had helped us yet. She delivers her drinks and immediately returns to help us. Such a great way to show great customer service!! She ended up being our server for the night until she switched shifts. I wish I had a chance to thank her for being attentive and giving such great service. Her name was MARIA. The next server was SELINA and she was also very good with us! Will definitely return here!",

I wish they would bring them back permanently (or a rotation menu featuring lamb) as I can never seem to be there at the \"right time\" of the year.  The food is good to above average.  The chicken lettuce wraps include romaine not bib lettuce.  It just doesn't taste right to me without the bib.  Happy Hour menu had several options which was nice.  I'm not a fan of bar stool height chairs and that is the majority available around the bar in order to get the happy hour menu.  I feel like a kid having to climb up into the chair which is uncomfortable to me (I'm short), but I have to deal with it in order to be in the bar area for the happy hour menu.  More regular table/chair seating around the bar area please.  Staff have always been courteous and efficient.  prices are agreeable.  The women's bathroom is consistently clean and the sink faucets are trendy.  Touch the faucet for water.  I don't see a way to control the water temperature pouring out of the fancy faucet.  Lamb options year round please.",

Let me preface this by saying I'm not really the type to complain about a meal. I had the chicken sandwich and it had so much breading, that I literally peeled it off to get to the chicken. I ate the sandwich after taking off the extra breading and it was pretty good. My only other complaint is that all of our fries were cold. I didn't mention the fries to the manager b/c I didn't want them to comp anything, and it won't stop me from giving it another try.  I did tell my server about the chicken and she ended up comping my sandwich-which was not what I wanted, nonetheless, I was grateful.

    "text": "Finally getting back to reviewing this place and man was it a change. Let me start off by saying get the nachos and pizza! They will blow your mind. The nachos had a ton of flavor due to the sauces added on top and all of the toppings, is it an appetizer or a meal? Well you're going to have to decide that for yourself because it can easily fill one to two people. The pizza had great cheese and great flavor. We finished off with a pot pie and man was it good. Overall what a huge difference! Everything we got was absolutely delicious and I was so happy to have had great service",

    "text": "I stopped by Lazy Dog when it first opened, had a couple beers and some fine, but forgettable, food. It took an eclectic group in search of an outdoor patio to bring me back a few years later for a fun evening around the fire pit. Then as fate would have it my love and I found our way back again at the request of our oldest daughter less than a week later. I wouldn't argue with those that shell out four stars for Lazy Dog. They do a pretty good job with the price-point they are working with. In fact the food may be a little better than that of your typical Bar & Grill, but after sampling nine different items this week, I didn't come across a reason I need to rush back Lazy Dog.   The most recent visit led us to the patio for an early dinner. The weather was magnificent this evening and the bustling patio was entirely full by the time we left. We might have been the only table free of a canine at our feet. Needless to say, we were serenaded by the squawks and barks of many a four footed friend throughout our time there. Why is it that the smallest dogs need to yap the most? Alas, I digress. Here in lies THE reason to go to Lazy Dog: they are certainly one of the most dog-friendly establishments around. That is, here in lies the reason to go, if you have a dog, the weather is great, and you don't mind the obvious accommodations that come along with a patio of dogs. So...I also wouldn't argue with those that would offer up two stars on atmosphere alone.   I enjoyed the Fish Tacos and Wok-Fired Calamari the most, but also had some love for the Caramelized Brussels Sprouts. The Grilled Garlic Flatbread & Marinara, Seared Ahi Salad, Sweet & Spicy Shrimp Bowl, and the Lentil Soup were all fine, as were the Seasonal Honey Thyme Old Fashioned and Asian Pear Cocktails...I might even order these A-OK items again if I was here.  The dog-friendly patio even comes complete with a dog menu of three dishes for you pooch to enjoy while you eat your food.",

    "text": "For the longest time, I thought Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar served hot dogs...forgive my ignorance. Instead they have a dog friendly patio, where they will willingly bring a bowl of water for your four-legged-companions, or you can order some food for them as well, while you are enjoying American-Fusion comfort food and drinks.  It was a beautiful, sunny day in Vegas, when we opted to grab a table outside on the patio...and as you may already know, if you decide to sit outside, then you should be entirely ready to be serenaded by dogs in every possible note.    I have so far had the following items: Fish Tacos Wok-Fired Calamari Grilled Garlic Flatbread & Marinara Caramelized Brussels Sprouts Seared Ahi Salad Sweet & Spicy Shrimp Bowl Lentil Soup Seasonal Honey Thyme Old Fashioned with buffalo trace bourbon Asian Pear with grey goose pear vodka  Most of the food items I have had were delicious and were good portion sizes. Service has been prompt and professional, and they were willing to accommodate some simple requests, and even suggested another modification to help ensure that it would come out the way we would like.   Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar is the perfect choice to bring your dog out, or hang out with a big group of friends on the patio. They also have seats around the fire pit, so if you are a little chilly at night, this is still a good choice.  -2018 review #5-",

My first time here, but my dining partner had been here before and remembered the corn chowder from last time.  So yummy and filling!  My friend's lemon chicken looked amazing and there were leftovers to take home.  Glad we saved room for butter cake at the end!  Even the coffee was smooth and needed no sweetener.  Our server Lisa and her manager Jake took good care of us.  I would eat here again and will bring my family next time.",

    "text": "I like the concept of a dog-friendly place where dogs can enjoy too, but I'm not sure how good it actually is for the dogs. There is an outdoor area where those with dogs eat. You have to keep your dog close to you, but many of the dogs bark and/or cry because they see all of the other dogs and want to play with them. It seems like it's just a big tease for the dogs.  As for the human food, it was fine, nothing noteworthy. My girlfriend and I both got cheeseburgers, and they were fine.  The servers were nice, but somewhat disorganized. My girlfriend wanted ranch with her fries and burger. We asked for it, twice, but it didn't arrive until the very end of our meal, so she had to have her burger dry. There wasn't any ketchup or anything on the table.",

    "text": "So on Friday, after doing some Ikea shopping with some of the besties, we were driving by downtown Summerlin shopping and wanted some grub, after some back and forth, we decided on Lazy Dog's. Since this was my first time here, I wanted to share my thoughts based on my experience  What I liked - The building is a stand alone on the North side of Downtown Summerlin mall complex with ample parking, thou the area was busy, we still had no problem finding a spot. As you walk in, the decor is pretty cool with 2 sculptures made from tools and locks in the form. Thou we didn't have any fur babies with us, we ate outside and the honestly the outdoor seating was really huge with a massive fire pit in the middle (thou not on).  Thou very busy, I felt our wait staff did an excellent job ensuring we were well taken care of.  It was also cool talking with everyone about their puppies and letting us pet them while we chatted. I really appreciated the design as outdoor seating is contained so no dogs can get out.  opportunities - The only thing keeping this from the convented 5 STAR RATING was the food quality. Myself, I got the fish and chips, OK, I know fish and chips is more of a coastal thing, but if I see fish and chips, I try it. I felt like the fish was just meh and was dry, took a lot of tarter sauce. My friends 6 year old got the kids Mac and cheese and it looked and tasted like something from a dollar box of Mac and cheese. On a positive note, the sweet tater tots were pretty good.   In conclusion, cool place to hang out and puppy watch, not sure if the restaurant is known for a special dish so let me know if there are any recommendations, but unless I'm out with my puppy, don't think I need to go back",

    "text": "This a great place to try in Downtown Summerlin! In fact, this is one of my favorite go-to spots. I like to bring friends and family here. I enjoy the ambiance, the food, and the service.  The prices are right and I will continue to frequent this establishment.   Let's get down to the details...   Ambiance:   Lazy Dog offers a casual and easy-going dining experience. Dog inspired decor everywhere (don't forget to check out the restroom signs).   They have a great patio that is dog friendly.  Choose to sit on the patio. It is a great option in the Fall/Winter/Spring in Las Vegas (they have heaters for chilly nights)  Tip: Don't like dogs? Don't sit on the patio.    Food:   I've been here breakfast, lunch, dinner, and happy hour.  I've been happy with everything I've tried.  I've tried a lot more than what I listed.  I take coworkers, family and friends here.  It's a solid crowd pleaser with an extensive menu.  They speckle the menu with a few seasonal dishes to keep things fresh.   Here are a few of my favorite items I've tried.   Wild Blueberry Pancakes (brunch menu) Yum. I really liked that they loaded it with blueberries (my favorite).  Beer Battered Fish n' Chips (lunch/main menu) I've had it for lunch (smaller portion). I liked it and they even bring vinegar for my fries. It also comes with apple cider vinegar slaw.   Butter Cake (sweet tooth menu) This is a butter cake topped with a strawberry and mint compote with vanilla bean ice cream and splash of balsamic. It was fantastic!   Edamame (small plates- main menu)  It was  spicy and delicious with a hint of citrus notes.   Seared Ahi Tuna (main menu) This sesame Ahi Tuna Steak is served over mashed cauliflower (don't knock until you give it a whirl).  It's topped with a light coconut curry sauce and is under 500 calories. It's delicious! I've ordered this at least 3 times..   Hummus Trio (starter)  This is exactly what you think it is. A trio of hummus. A walnut-pesto, sundried tomato and traditional classic hummus. These are served with toasted garlic bread , sliced cucumbers, and tomatoes. They will also bring more bread and veggies is you ask with a smile (say cheese).    Cocktails:  Moscow Mule: This is a solid choice. This is what I normally order.  I like the fact that they have a clean cocktail menu. The clean cocktail menu offers tasty drinks that are low on calories/sugar.  They have list of drinks under 175 calories that are made with no artificial ingredients.   Wild Blueberry Lemon Drop: Another one of their clean cocktails under 175 calories that are made with no artificial ingredients. I loved this drink, too!   Mango Chile Margarita  My Mom and Husband's go to when they're here.   Service:  Their service has always been super friendly and efficient.  They usually have a manager walking the floor checking in on tables (always a welcomed gesture). Servers have always offered their opinion when asked to about their favorite menu items.   Overall, this is a solid 4.5/5 star establishment in my book!   Yelp Review #16 2016",

Mika was hungry so I said I'd pick at her food with her.  Three dishes later, I'm carrying myself out of the place, satiated and defeated. Not to mention we totally skipped Thor cause we got carried away.   TRIED to be healthy as possible: ordered the roasted street carrots and they were so different, topped with a cilantro kind of crema, great starter dish. These special fries with this house sauce that we mopped dry. And then the seared ahi salad because you can never go wrong with it. Food was exceptional and I wanna cross more off my list.   We were sitting at the bar and Ryan was our boy. Took such good care of us and did way more than we had to. Also, would just like genuinely kick it with this guy? Super cool. He let me sample a couple beers because we both shared an intimate bond over IPA. Threw together a couple great margaritas (no sweet & sour, agave and natural ingredients) and balanced his professionalism with being a stand up guy quite harmoniously. Coming back to this spot 200% thank you guys.",

Hostess was unfriendly and seemed burdened because we couldn't take a high-top table outside due to two seniors with us and a small dog--there were several open tables at the time. Waiter Timijen came by for a drink order, food order, and once when we were pretty much done--we had to ask server and a different waitperson for refills, silverware, and some condiments. Veggie Burger Bowl was very good.  Cobb Salad okay.  Decent burgers but one not cooked correctly and fries and onion rings were cold.  Meal is now completed.  No waiter. No refills. No bill.  No one checking on us.   I've eaten at this location a few times and it's often disappointing, only redeeming qualities are location (for us) and dog-friendly, when needed. Town Square location is much better, if you must dine here.  Oh, waiter finally came, so we asked for the bill...",

The bartop itself was pretty dirty but the real issue was the drink lists and menus: they were sticky and had crumbs on them.  We ordered 4 items, all described below.  Edamame- 3/5 Great flavors but they were really the smallest I have ever seen and many of the pods were empty.  Bacon egg mac and cheese 2/5 The flavors were ok but it was super small for $7.  It also was just very underwhelming and did not have much bacon or egg.  Havarti Turkey sandwich 1/5 Sandwich was dry, the bread was burnt and the fries had no seasoning.  Pork egg fried rice 3/5 The rice tasted ok but there wasn't much pork in it.  On the way out my friend and I used the restroom and it was a pretty unpleasant experience.  There was little to no toilet paper, no hand soap and an overflowing trashcan.",

Well I hope I have my reaction to dairy here before I go home.   Seriously though. Not cool.  Oh and appetizers came out after the meal. Lol",

I am vegan and don't like to make a huge deal about it because I'd rather talk about anything but my diet choices. The wait staff \"Darlene\" was not only accommodating, but subtle and helpful, so I was the only one who heard her suggestions. She really came through with choices for me that were delicious and plant based. This is not the only shout out for Darlene. She has an incredible memory, she was amazingly intuitive and noticed every little issue at the table of 8. We told her one of us was late and when our straggler finally made it she called her by name an got her a menu instantly. I certainly hope this corporation know what an amazing person and professional server she is. She is a keeper. I would never have wasted the time to review Lazy Dog if Darlene hadn't made this meal such a positive experience! Everyone enjoyed their food and the company.  Fabulous service can make the meal exceptional.",

We had one minor issue with the portion size on one of the choices we made, but we spoke to the manager and they rectified the problem immediately.

So we made a 2 hour drive. Our party size was 7. When we got there they sat us inside.   I have a very unique allergy, I am allergic to watermelon; I can't be around it, at all, or I go into anaphylaxis. Their seasonal fruit was watermelon. We asked to be moved outside so I could stay with the family. We were told that outside seating is not available for a party our size. I ended up leaving the restaurant, because my throat was closing and I couldn't breath. I ended up sitting, alone, in my vehicle waiting for my family to be done eating.  I am Extremely! disappointed in the lack of care or accommodation, from this facility and their staff, for someone in my position.  All I wanted was to spend time with my family and enjoy a decent meal. We drove over 2 hours to eat there and this was our experience.   If anyone has any form of allergy or special accommodation needs, I would suggest you chose someplace else to go.",

Eating with a pup: We took our dog here for her birthday. They have you sit outside in their patio area. If you have a more rowdy dog, I don't recommend going during their peak hours. We came on a weekday afternoon, and were able to find a table far enough away from all the other pups. They give your dog a water bowl just as your table gets glasses of water. We ordered her the chicken and rice bowl. Great portion size because she's a fairly small dog. She loved it! Nearly finished it.  The waitress was friendly and all was dandy.   Happy Hour: One of my favorites in the summerlin area. Delicious sangria! (Order by the pitcher for $15!) the chipotle fries are great for the price. All of their snacks are yummy and affordable. Happy hour is in bar area or patio during specific times ONLY so keep that in mind!   Inside dining: This is why the review has 4 stars. Eating dinner here is nothing more than eating at an expensive Applebees. The food is alright, but nothing memorable. Service is fantastic, though!",

He had the grilled cheese sandwich and said it was amazing, so we decided to give it a try for dinner.   The service was amazing! There were so many choices, it was difficult to decide, but everyone liked what they got.  We ordered the Grizzly Fries for an appetizer.  It looked small, but it was soooo good and very filling.  We had the black and bleu hamburger with fries, very good.  I had the Bison Burger...cooked medium. I felt it was under cooked, but better undercooked than overdone.  And it tasted so good!  The Cole Slaw was very good as well.  My husband had the BBQ Bison meatloaf, which was recommended by the waiter.  So good.  I had the jamaican lemonade which was also good.  I had ordered a coke before I realized that they had some awesome alcohol free drinks from the bar.  I ordered Jamaican lemonade.  My waiter brought me that and also kept bringing refills of my coke and didn't charge me extra for it.  I appreciated that.  I ordered the white chocolate pretzel cheesecake for desert for all of us to share.  It was amazing and since it was my birthday, the waiter got permission to make that complimentary.  We had a excellent experience.  I liked the decor.  It was noisy, but I would expect that for a place like this.  It's not in a casino, which is a plus for me, as I hate walking through the smoky casino to get to the restaurant.  I will come back here again and again.  Loved it!",

She took such good care of the two of us,  I ordered the chicken Spanish salad and a couple glasses of wine. And French fry's for my little Geisha, that's the greatest thing to be able to have lunch with ur pup & bestie.  Amy suggested the portobello burger for Lisa who happens to be a vegetarian. She loved it.  And we finished it up with the desert butter cake,  over all it was a such a perfect way to spend lunch and the our afternoon.  Next time I'll have a puppy party and invite all the girls.",

The menu was so hard to pick from because they have such a variety and everything sounded so yummy ! Started off with the sangria sampler although I enjoyed them all my favorite was the white peach. Then I finally picked the ribs my fiance got the ranch cheeseburger , my friend a seared ahi and the other not sure as he inhaled it before anyone could say \"how is your food\" haha . My ribs were cooked great and the sauce was enough to get messy but not too much ! The mashed potatoes were delicious. Then we followed up with some desert I got the pumpkin cheesecake every bite was perfection ! The only thing I was sad about was that we didn't know dogs were welcomed on the patio ! We will definitely be going back and taking our dog max !",

The calamari can be a meal on its own and the hush puppies are a good appetizer to start with.  Service is good, but I took off two stars cuz we asked for our bill, but weren't done eating yet.  They were just busy and we did not want to flag him down later when we were ready to leave.  Anyways a busser pretty much came and like waited by our table which was super awkward and made us feel very uncomfortable.  He also kept talking to my son and asked if we were done with certain plates so he could take it up.    It felt as if they were trying to rush us out, and lost out on a couple more bucks for tip... Oh well on you...  I will still probably come back here since my first two times were good experiences...hopefully this was just that \"one time\" experience.",

Within minutes the manager came by to apologize and brought us an order of fries instead.  We didn't eat them that quickly and here comes Jennifer offering to bring a a fresh warm order of fries.  One of the most pleasant dining experience my wife and I have had in recent memory.  Can't wait to go back!!!",

Aside from the aforementioned things, Lazy Dogs does something really right, and that's customer service. Tonight my girlfriend and I were served by Jennifer - she was awesome! I got the chicken pot pie for the first time, and she got the campfire pot roast, which is one of our collective favorites. Both were amazing. I drank the housemate ginger beer (nice ginger zing and super refreshing) and she got the Jamaican lemonade, which is hard not to choose every time we go. Their alcoholic drinks are good too, St Ruby is choice. Tonight we got dessert, the s'mores brownie topped with a housemate toasty marshmallow. So. Good. I was so full but this had to happen. Jennifer took that extra step and gave my girlfriend not only an extra take-home container of gravy, but a separate one of the sauteed spinach that topped her pot roast.   Anyway, we will of course be back because we haven't left dissatisfied once. Thanks Lazy Dog!",

    "text": "I don't leave many yelp reviews, but my experience yesterday was so disappointing that I wanted to leave this one to save others from having the same experience. My children and I walked in the restaurant and there were three employees and the manager, Eric, at the hostess stand. I stood there for a few minutes while they carried on a conversation. At no point was there a greeting, smile or anything, until I interrupted and asked them if they knew where my husband was sitting. When I was seated, and I asked the server what he'd recommend for appetizers, he recommended two. I said I'd take both of those. Apparently, \"both of those\" also sounds like \"nachos\" because he brought me those as well, when I didn't order nachos, but of course still paid for them. The food was okay, but there are other restaurants in downtown summerlin that have far superior cuisine (crave, CPK, public school, etc).  When I pre-bussed the table by stacking empty plates, the manager asked me if I'd like him to take the dishes out of my way. I told him he could if he'd like and he responded with, \"We don't like people sitting with dirty dishes in front of them,\" which is a very odd response. A more professional response would have been, \"my pleasure,\" or something along those lines. Overall, it was not an enjoyable dining experience, mostly due to the poor service and management.  If you'd like to save yourself the disappointment, you might want to go somewhere else.",

I asked what the hostess' in the front name was and she said her name was Shelby or Shelly something like that.

It was a fun place to hang out and the atmosphere I give an 8 out of 10. The patio was nice and you can bring your dogs but wayyyy to hot in this heat during the summer. It has a nice fire pit in the center so sitting on the patio come fall/winter seems more ideal. The house sangria was terrible. I got the sampler because I wasn't sure which I would like and I'm glad I did. The peach tasted more like vodka and rubbing alcohol and the other two tasted like a cross between a jolly rancher and cough syrup, not good. I did however get an extra dry extra dirty martini and it was fabulous! The happy hour menu was pretty delicious and had quite a number of options. We got the nachos, chicken tenders, and Cajun fries. The nachos were great! Perfect amount of cheese, avocado, salsa, etc for every chip. No chip was uncovered! The chicken tenders were basic tenders nice size and very moist. The Cajun fries were my favorite yum yum not too spicy but just enough flavor! If you looking for a laid back spot with a good happy hour this is the place to go; avoid the patio in summer and don't get the sangria you will regret it!",

He finally came over and took our burgers back. About 15 minutes later, we got new burgers but this time they were so well done they were dark brown all through. Again, the waiter never came by to ask how everything was. They were completely tasteless and dry. Never did see the waiter again. We finally asked a different waiter to get us our check, which he did. Paid for the burgers and needless to say, didn't leave a tip   I blame the manager.

Great food the only downside is wait time which is understandable can't go wrong with the Baja guacamole burger my other favorite dishes are the poblano chicken the ahi tuna burger but without a doubt you have to get the brussel sprouts trust me it's nothing like what your mom used to give you as a kid perfect pair with a 22 ounce Stella",

He helped me find out what dishes could be made vegan* and was quick with a beer suggestion. I'm more of a cat person, but it was cute to have dogs out on the patio. The mason jar drink of the month is Jameson & Ginger. I'll be back for that!   *Short Rant: I think the vegans need to hire the gluten-free PR people. It seems every restaurant will have special GF menus or notations of GF items. Typically for vegan options I only see this happen at restaurants that already cater to vegetarians/vegans. Okay...rant over. Enjoy your dinner!",

Needless to say I was pretty hungry & became crabby after my wait went longer than estimated. Already in a grouchy mood I was just ready to be sat, eat, and be out of there! But my night took a very unexpected yet pleasant turn when I was greeted by my server Maria, I didn't have the chance to get her last name but she was this young little lady with glasses, red hair & she had a nose piercing I believe. Maria had the upmost energetic personality & gave us great service the entire night even though I could tell she had a few too many tables haha in all honesty I have never came across a server that handled themselves as well as Maria under so much pressure. Through all the chaos Maria still managed to come by our table to refill our drinks a few times and made sure we were taken care of the whole night. If all of Lazy Dog's employees have the same energy & work ethic as Maria I will definitely keep coming back! 10/10 Very pleased",

We asked about their happy hour (we had a late reservation, 9pm dinner) and the manager let us order from the menu even though we weren't sitting in the bar area which was so great, we ordered a few extra appetizers since we got the happy hour prices :)  They also allow dogs on their patio area, my husband and I can't wait to take our pooch for lunch one day!

I visited on Easter Sunday & I was pleasantly surprised there wasn't a line!  I quickly got a table & was greeted by the most friendly & hospitable hostess & server. The cocktails were fresh & tasty. I am still undecided about the food. We ordered the Ahi Poke appetizer & I loved it. It was fresh & was very good. Since it was brunch I ordered Chilaquiles. It looked like it had sat for a while since it was dry & had very little eggs, sauce or cheese to be found. I ordered a burger to replace it & it arrived cold & a little underdone. I will be back to try something else but this place may be better for cocktails & appetizers.",

They returned with the most beautiful creation of butter cake topped with a brownie and strawberries that they assured us was completely nut free and not cross contaminated.  My son ate nearly the whole thing and had the biggest smile on his face.  We never eat dessert at restaurants because of food allergies but now we found our place to go.  We are so excited!",

They also have way better prices for just as good food around the mall.   I had the Chicken Poblano. Excellent. Especially the sauce. It has a lot of spices in it, so your nose must be prepared.   Another tip: the stick ribs are good, but beware. This is more of the Asian style BBQ sauce, not Hawaiian. But, they were still good.  There's not much else I feel like I need to say. I would love to bring my dog here and let him gaze upon the mall from the patio.",

    "text": "I came here to drop of some toys for the Yelp's Toys for Tater Tots.  It was mid-afternoon and there were few people inside and two or three tables used on the patio.  I ordered the chicken curry bowl for my lunch/dinner.  My iced tea was brought quickly and was refilled without needing to ask.  The menu describes the bowl in this way:  Chicken and vegetables, slow-cooked in our scratch made coconut curry, served over steamed white or brown rice with our fiery carrot slaw.  The carrot slaw was not fiery to my taste but it did have some red pepper sesame oil poured on the carrot thins and it was very good.  You have the option of white or brown rice and I chose brown.  The curry chicken had a good curry flavor and the serving size was very generous.  Throwing caution to the wind (when don't I?) I ordered dessert--the Simms Family S'more.  The menu describes it thusly:  ...this house favorite is made with layers of rich chocolate fudge, graham cracker crust, peanut butter and warm brownie, topped with a giant, fire-roasted, housemade marshmallow and crushed peanuts.  The s'more was OK but I'd get a different dessert the next time.  The chocolate was very good but the marshmallow was a bit of a challenge.  Since it's one thick piece of marshmallow, you have to attack it with your spoon, hold it up off the dish, and wait for the lower part to slowly drop away.  It was a bit of a challenge using just the spoon.  It was tasty but I never like fighting with my food.  Service was outstanding.  What would normally me a 3 star review earned the fourth star with the friendliness of the staff.  Although it was a rather slow time, I'm guessing it's generally that way.    Close to home and a good selection, I'll be back.",

Hmmmmmm.... we didn't make a to go order. Now the gal is gone and Carrie comes back 5 min later to say I don't know where they got the to go order from.  So than takes another 15 min to get our appetizers. No apologies or anything.  Than 15 minutes later we received our entree.  Overall not impressed at all and will never come back. I could have cooked at home and not wasted time waiting an hour and half for chicken breast. While the managers or people who had keys were at the bar chuckling it up with their friends. No one even acknowledge the mistake. Overall slow service & the food was burnt which was also disappointing !  Chris- thank you for reaching out, howeverI don't have access to contact you via Yelp.

We wanted to sit outside but there weren't any tables available initially so we got a table inside but then ended up moving outside a few minutes later when a table opened up. I got a mimosa and the Thai Chicken Salad. I was surprised, they actually gave me a full small bottle of prosecco and about half a tall glass of orange juice so it was make-your-own-mimosa! I didn't use all of the prosecco in the first glass so asked for some more orange juice and the waiter provided that in a smaller glass so that was nice. The salad was good; very good flavor and not too large. The waiter was super friendly and attentive and it was nice sitting outside with the dogs!",

More restaurants should have pet accommodations, after all they're our fur babies :) I usually feel guilty when I leave my sweet phatty at home on my days off. He really likes being out and about and Lazy Dog grants me the ability to enjoy myself without neglecting him. Food and drinks are pretty good. I enjoy their martinis and wine flight. Great bloody mary's for brunch too. Food wise, sticky ribs with slaw are awesome - meaty with good flavor. I really enjoyed the ahi burger and like their twist on the calamari app. The calamari is stir fried in plum sauce and comes on a bed of rice. Really yummy! The service has been great every time. Accommodating and personable staff. I take patio seating since that is the only area where pups are allowed. My favorite part of the bring your dog to eat concept is that your pup will eat too! They will serve your fur baby water and you can buy them a protein and rice bowl. You have a choice of white or brown rice and either chicken or beef patty. My phatty loves the patty (hehe). What I have yet to try is their desert. I used to hit up Gelato Messina after Lazy Dog but since they are no longer in DT Summerlin, I will have to dabble in the desert menu.",

Today had some errands to run at downtown Summerlin ( returns ) and so we decided to check out one of many restaurants in Downtown Summerlin. Funny thing is out of all the ones we have not tried yet, this was our choice as we have been repeat diners here. Bring your furry friend for outdoor patio seating.   Happy Hour is where it is! We ordered a plate of Nachos, some Mac N Cheese and i saw \"Fire fried rice\" so i just had to try it. The Nachos are HUGE! Repeat, HUGE. Had we known they were that big, we would not have ordered the other stuff.   We ended up taking enough leftovers home for a whole other meal. The rice was just as depicted plus it had a nice sunny side up egg sitting right on top!  A little Sriracha and we are off to the races! The Mac n Cheese was awesome as were the Nachos. The rice is a must try!  Well, we decided to save money and just order water but the beer selection was just to tempting not to try. A pale ale for the wife and a Hefewiezen  for yours truly. All of that and we got out for under 27 bucks.   There are plenty of servers and the service is top notch here. They are on their \"A\" game here. I love the rustic lodge decor depicted.   As for the story of Lazy Dogs ..... Read Below .... I love Jackson Hole!  Growing up, Chris and his family would vacation in the breathtaking mountains of Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Whether it was skiing in the winter or fishing in the summer, Chris will tell you that even today it is the place he goes when he wants to get away and relax.   When you are in any one of the Lazy Dog restaurants, you will see how Chris has tried to capture and recreate the feeling he gets when in Jackson Hole. He wants you to feel like you are walking into a place that is the perfect balance of warm and comfortable, yet full of excitement and positive energy.   For Chris, the lodge represents vacations with family and friends. Jackson Hole is a small town with a True sense of hospitality. Get your car stuck in the snow, and the next person who passes by will stop to help. Most likely, they'll even know your name.  Where did the Lazy Dog name come from? One snowy afternoon, walking back into the lodge after a long morning on the slopes, Chris noticed a dog lying by the toasty fireplace. Commenting to his buddies on how much he loved his time hanging out there, he told them he wished everyone could enjoy life as much as that \"lazy dog' by the fire.  On their last run down the ski slopes in Jackson Hole, everyone has one thing on their mind: get these skis off and head to the lodge. Whether you're sitting by the fire or bellying up to the bar, the servers and bartenders know what you like and treat you like you're one of the family. The lodge has cold beer, hot chocolate, incredible food and great music, making it the place to be in town.   Just like the lodge in Jackson Hole, the Lazy Dog offers the perfect environment for all ages, making the entire restaurant the place to be for a quick dinner with the family, a meandering meal with friends or a night out on the town.",

    "text": "What a fun and delicious place! My friends were happy we chose this place so they could bring the pup. They even got to order something for her - a burger that came with a scoop of rice!  It was a Sunday, so their brunch menu was available and I chose to order from that. I got the carnitas Hash which featured sweet potato tater tots, home fries, bell peppers, onions and a green sauce. The sauce is definitely where all the flavor was. And it's definitely a potato heavy dish, which makes me happy! This dish was delicious, but I'd be perfectly happy to try something else next time.   Like maybe the Sticky Ribs? My friend Mr. P let me try a bite of his. The plum BBQ sauce isn't particularly plum-y tasting. But it's sweet on the front and vinegar-y on the back. Very nice!  The service was friendly, but definitely on the slow side. But I know we'll go back despite that!",

    "text": "Updated Review:  After posting my initial review for Lazy Dog, one of the managers, Brooke, reached out to me. She apologized profusely and let me know that my experience was not up to par with Lazy Dog's standards. She said she would love for me to come in again in the future so that I could really get the wonderful customer service I deserve. As I said in my last review, I very much enjoyed the food, drinks, and atmosphere; it was just the hospitality that was lacking. Because of the many pros, I decided to go back to Lazy Dog with my friend for dinner. Our server, Eric, was extremely attentive. He checked on us frequently but gave us enough space to not be bothersome. He refilled our waters, told us about the specials, and always made sure we were happy with everything. I got the Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad, the Grilled 5 Cheese Sandwich, and the Jamaican Lemonade. My friend ordered the Fried Hush Puppies and a Cobb Salad. The Jamaican Lemonade was SOOOOO good! And my salad and the hush puppies were delicious. The salad was HUGE (like the size of your face), and I couldn't finish it. I'd ordered the sandwich because I thought the salad was just your normal sized salad, and I thought I'd still be hungry. NOPE! But I tasted the sandwich, and I wasn't a fan. I don't know why (the sourdough? The cheeses?), but I took it to-go for my mom to have. My friend also loved her salad and the hush puppies. And her dog very much enjoyed her brown rice with veggies. Overall, I had a wonderful time the second go around! The food and drinks were good, and the service was fantastic! Thank you, Brooke, for really taking into consideration your guests' experiences and listening! I think that's one of the most important things you can do as a manager: listen to your customers. Brooke was so sweet, understanding, and really wanted to make sure I had a better experience by showing me that Lazy Dog really cares about customer service and making sure you leave happy (Thanks again Eric!). I will definitely be returning!(:  Previous Review (4 Stars):  Came here for the first time last night as I heard the food was really good. Also, you can bring your dog here, and who doesn't love that idea?! I love the restaurant's decor and overall outdoorsy/trendy vibe. The menu has many options for drinks and food, which is nice! Our waitress, Alex, gave us ample time to look over the extensive menu to decide on what to drink and eat. She told us about the seasonal items, specials, and her recommendations. We ordered, and although our drinks and food took quite awhile to be delivered, they were delicious! However, Alex made a few inappropriate remarks about my eating habits and didn't have the best attitude after the initial greeting.  In addition, there was a large group of people next to us who appeared to be Lazy Dog employees that just got off shift, were on their break, or had the day off and decided to stop by for drinks. They were incredibly noisy and exasperating. Alex and other employees that were currently working would stop at the table to chit chat with their coworkers, which just seemed unprofessional.  Overall, I'm pleased with my experience at Lazy Dog. I loved the food and the whole dog friendly idea. What I loved the most was the outdoor seating where you could bring your dogs to sit while you ate. I met a few people's dogs, and they were so sweet! I LOVE dogs more than people honestly, so I was in dog heaven. With that being said, Lazy Dog really needs to work on their customer service and make sure their employees are working and not conversing with their coworker friends. Also, employees that aren't currently on the clock shouldn't be wearing their uniforms when they're patrons, and they need to remember that they still need to act professionally and not distract their coworkers that are working.  I'll be back, but I hope to have better customer service next time.",

I had the slow cooked braised pork fried rice that was perfectly flavored no need for soy sauce. Their dog friendly as well! They allow service dogs on the inside and every other pooch is welcomed outside on the patio as long as you don't place them in your lap or allow them on the table, but the best part of the brunch was Ms. Jen! She had a smile that would knockout a few stars with a personality to match! Thanks for the anniversary butter cake!",

My date had been here before but this was my first time and I lucked out by having an amazing Waitress named Finn helping us . Hopefully I spelled her name right but either way I definitely recommend asking for her if you head here .. she's not only a beautiful soul ( totally aligns and relates and just shines the light ) she also has killer food recommendations and awesome taste in tv shows .. yes! Even that was discussed ..  Anyone who follows my reviews regularly knows I often suffer from service troubles at some of the strangest places lol but this was a stand out experience ..  I love how it's dog friendly and has such a variety of food .. now is it going to be a gourmet dining experience for the avid foodie.. probably not but over all I had a great time with great company while enjoying some yummy calamari and some fish and chips ..  I look forward to going back to try some beer!",

But as we continued going to this location it the service, as well as the food, keep going down.  For example, one time as we walked in the hosts, were hanging out and talking behind their desk and didn't even acknowledge that we had just walked in. it was almost as if we were bothering them.   The food most of the time came out cold after our first time being there. We loved the buffalo chicken lollipops but they would always get to our table after a long time it seemed like and they lose their crunch, unfortunately ...  On the other hand, their black and bleu pizza is one of a kind, it is pretty greasy so I would recommend sharing it with someone.  For their desserts, the butter cake is to die for, so definitely get that!",

The menu is awesome, they have tons of small plates (try the Brussels sprouts!), buffalo cauliflower, tots, green beans, etc. Would be great to share with the table. They also have lots of main plates that looks good (bison burger, pasta dishes and a great avocado toast). Their peach sangria is really good and they have good prices all day.

There is an outdoor patio where pets are welcome.  However, unlike pet friendly places where you sit in the heat outside, this place goes above and beyond by having outdoor cooling machines and fans for your furry friends.  They also have a dog menu where they provide iced water and your option of hamburger, grilled chicken, or a veggie option for your pup.  If you love dogs, the patio is the place to be.  If you are not a fan of dogs or are allergic, sitting inside may be your best option.    Other things to note: -your dog must not bark and bite  Pros: -super awesome place to take your dog (there was everything from tiny pups to German Shepards and Saint Bernards). -Dog menu options -indoor and outdoor seating option -yummy ginger beer  Overall, I wish more places could be like the Lazy Dog.  Sooooo awesome!",

Everything sounds delicious and every time I've come here, I've been blown away!  Their service is impeccable. Been here a few times on my lunch break and they are always so considerate of that and work really hard to make sure we enjoy our food quickly. The atmosphere is always lively and friendly and the staff works together so well to make everyone's experience a good one.   On my most recent visit I ordered the bison meatloaf, and everything about it was exceptional. From the presentation to the flavor, this dish hit every point. The spinach was perfectly steamed, so not runny or slimy. The carrots were perfectly candied and used as part of the gravy; unbelievable. The bison itself was so moist and flavorful every bite melted in my mouth.   A great place for everyone with service, ambience and food all exceptional!!",

They have a bar, the restaurant and the outside patio. Nice place to watch any of the games.   I remember they use to have monday happy hour all day but the happy hours have changed, now it's mon-friday 3-6pm and sunday through thursday 9pm - close. They have $3-$8 drink specials and $3-$9 food specials on happy hour.   The food I like here: The house made hummus (great portion), Cajun fries (usually if you check in on Yelp, you get a free basket of these fries),  grilled garlic flatbread, and their bananas foster (on the brunch menu).    Can't wait until I come back, I want to try the buffalo cauliflower wings next and the seasonal butternut squash soup (only through sept-dec)!",

Don't get me wrong, I am a dog lover, but my dog is 6.5 lbs and a non-shedder, very well mannered, never makes a sound in public. Does not beg, bark or bite. With that being said, I took my dog and sat on the patio. She sat under my chair without making a peep. Out of courtesy of others, I would never bring a shedding dog to an outdoor patio. Have some respect - not everyone likes dog hair in their food!!! I should have expected that with so much advertising as \"dog-friendly\" that the patio floor would be filthy and it was. Clumps of dog hair all over the floor, dog hair flying all thru the air! Gross!!! Their \"dog rules\" clearly states no dogs on chairs or in laps, the lady at the table next to me held her dog in her lap the whole time. Some kind of big dog at another table was licking a soon-to-be occupied table! DISGUSTING FOR THE POOR PEOPLE THAT WAS NEXT FOR THAT TABLE. Dogs are dogs, people please control your dogs, or better yet, leave them at home if they shed, bark, beg or bite! The waitress/server said, \"I'll bring your dog some water\". I said, \"thank you\". 20 min later, no water. Asked for water, she blamed it on someone else.  Asked for Parm cheese for my pizza, half way thru my pizza, she brings the cheese. I ask for a to-go box, waited 15 min - had to ask again. My dog wouldn't even drink out of their water dish because it had dog hair (not her's) floating around in it. Please, Lazy Dog - make some rules...... half off a section for dogs and half for no dogs. i will probably never go back, but if I ever do - I will not bring a dog and will not sit outside on the filthy dog-hair, barking, begging, licking dogs everywhere patio! Also, with so many dogs shedding and shaking, if you don't get dog hair in your food outside, you are likely to get it in your food inside because the hair is flying around in the air, sticking to the servers clothes, they walk inside, take the dog hair with them! ughhhh, I'm done with my rant!",

    "text": "We stopped into Lazy Dog on a Thursday night during happy hour (9pm-close). Happy hour is only served in the bar and patio area. We got 2 beers ($1 off drafts) and two Asian pear martinis ($6). The food specials for happy hour range from $3 to $8. We took advantage of the free order of cajun fries for checking into yelp. The portion size is very large and served with a code of chipotle ranch. We also ordered wings ($5) and the \"All American\" burger (ala carte for $5).  I overall enjoyed all of the food and drinks and will definitely be back to try more!  Worthy mention: if you have a friendly dog, you are allowed to dine with them on the patio!",

    "text": "Great service and very dog friendly. We went out shopping and had our dogs with us.  This is a great place to grab drinks and order appetizers but I wouldn't come back here for dinner.  Might be a better choice for breakfast or brunch instead.  My husbands chicken pot pie was too watered down and was too heavy. My chicken Kung pao was way too salty!  Everyone took one bite and complained that all they could taste was the salt!  Perfect dish if you love over salty and overpowering flavorful foods.  My mother in law got the Alfredo fettuccine but this dish just tasted like heavy cream.  No flavor!  Very boring and easy to get sick of eating after couple of bites.  My father in law ordered a meat and pasta dish that was one of the best compared to other 3dishes.  Overall I like their brunch menu but wasn't too thrilled with how they flavor and salt the dinner dishes.",

We will be back for sure and sitting with our new favorite server. In fact, my granddaughter wants to make it a family tradition. Thank you Laura for making out first ever trip to Lazy Dig a wonderful experience. We will see you soon! If you visit this location and Laura is your server consider yourself lucky!",

Her attitude kind of made me NOT want to stay and eat here but I had a dog with me, so I  had no choice being that there are no other dog friendly restaurants in Downtown Summerlin. I literally just asked some simple questions like if I was allowed to eat inside with the dog and she replied to me like I was dumb, because I \"obviously\" wasn't allowed to (insert eye roll here). Once we sat down, the menu just looked ordinary, nothing too special. They have lunch specials everyday though! I opted for the chicken parm - it was not that good. They also have a doggy menu which I thought was really cool. We got our dog the hamburger with brown rice - not going to lie but I thought it looked better than my food haha Oh! and we also didn't know that dogs weren't allowed in our laps when we were sitting at the table - the hostess (another one that shows you where your seat is, not sure if she was a hostess though) scolded us (insert other eye roll here). Foodwise, we had also gotten the spinach dip - all cheese no spinach honestly. The food is not good here AND I felt the staff was somewhat rude. Needless to say, NOT coming to this location again.",

On several different visits the servers have failed to remove dirty dishes and glasses once we are done with them. We had a bowl of empty edamame sit on our table for 2 hours. It was not removed even after stacking all the dishes and pushing them to the end of the table. This is simply unacceptable and ruining the dining experience. I am in the service industry myself, and this would never be tolerated at my work. That being said, I love this place and will continue to come back.

The patio has awesome fire pits and is dog friendly. Part of the fun of eating here is dog watching!   The menu is fantastic - I recommend the calamari as an appetizer. It's not your run of the mill calamari, rather it's Asian seasoned and served with rice. They also have fantastic fish tacos and sandwiches for your main course. The best drink on the menu hands down is the coconut mojito. It tastes like a tropical vacation.   The bathrooms are clean and the wait staff is friendly.   4 stars because we wanted to order the roasted Chicken + Havarti sandwich but they were out of Havarti cheese so we had to order something else.",

The dogs can only sit in the patio area, so I have only experienced the dining experience from the outside. The area is nice and spacious with many tables that can seat customers. There are plenty of fans and shades to cool you off in the summer and I believe there is a fire pit that can warm you up in the winter (I have yet to witness this as it's crazy hot here in Vegas right now!)    My experience: The food is mediocre, there wasn't a wow factor for me yet and I've been here twice. Let's just say this is just not food I would crave, but it is good enough. For the first time I got the Ahi poke jar that came with wonton crisps. As for the second time, I got the pot roast beef dip. One thing that I liked most out of their menu was the street corn wheel's (pretty much an elote).   My dog's experience: He gets water in a bowl and he ordered the brown rice with grilled chicken breast. Overall, satisfied with his food and water under the table!",

Although dog friendly, it's not overly crazy as they have a good set of rules for our four legged compadres.   Aside from the great atmosphere and friendly staff, they have the best edamame in all the land. I've never been a huge 'mam fan till I moved here but I'm hooked. Hummus ain't bad either. Happy hour menu is great and they have one of the best beer offerings in town.  There is a great bartender there that looks like Wolverine; he told me I'd be back often after the first time I was there, and well, Hugh Jackman wasn't wrong. This place rocks.",

    "text": "First time to Lazy Dog and we loved it. We dropped in right at happy hour which was a super lucky occurrence for us so we sat at one of the booths at the bar to partake. We were very hungry and decided to try a lot of dishes from the happy hour menu. We may have overdone it a little.   First off the service was beyond excellent. Our waiter was super friendly and took amazing care of us. Plus the manager brought us out some free garlic flat bread when they found out we were first timers. How cool is that?   Every dish we ordered was great. No, this isn't a gourmet expensive restaurant. It's a bar and grill kind of restaurant but with much much much better food. The hummus trio was a delicious start and I loved the ahi poke. It was super fresh and definitely a good snack. We also enjoyed the chicken verde nachos which were absolutely massive!   I really would like to go back and try more stuff off their menu. Plus you can bring your dog and sit on the covered outdoor patio. I love dog friendly establishments!",

    "text": "So I've been to this location 4 times. The first time I came I was impressed by the variety of food and I loved that it was so noisy that kids are welcomed. The second time I came was with coworkers for lunch. We sat at the bar and I got my sandwich as well as my other coworker a good 10 minutes before my other coworker got her soup. I thought it was a bit strange but I didn't really think it was too big of a deal. It took them awhile to get us the check so we could get out there. I think we were there for a hour and a half and it wasn't because we were wasting time. My 3rd time here, I made reservations for a party of 10. It was ok but my brother's entree took a good 15 minutes to arrive after all 9 of our entrees had arrived. Service was quick in the beginning but lacking at the end.   Fast forward to my 4th and last visit to this place. We made reservations for 5 pm. It took them 10 minutes to seat us, I'm assuming that they didn't have the tables ready. There were about 4 hostesses up there. After we were seated we had our drink orders taken right away and the appetizers. We then had to wait another 15 minutes for her to come back and take our order which would be fine but I saw that she took a drink order for another table, brought them drinks and took their order. I know we were a big table but you would think that you want to get rid of us first. She came and took our order and it took another 15 minutes to get our entrees. Well one of my brothers didn't get his entree and we didn't see our server for another 10-15 minutes after that. I asked about it and she said she would check. I saw her check the computer as well as her notes. His food came out about 5-10 min later. By that time we were all done eating and when they brought it out it was the wrong thing. They brought out the manager and said that the entree would be comped blah blah blah. My brother said he said he ordered a certain type of chicken but when she repeated it she said another thing  but she changed it to what he said so in his head he was like oh crap. His entree did end up coming out correctly but by then I was just really annoyed. Service has been an issue the past 3 times that I've been here and I'm just over it. It's hard to find anyone to ask questions and I rather spend my money elsewhere even though their food is decent.",

But the stars I left are definitely for a reason. I came here last night for a friends birthday celebration, the atmosphere was really nice!  But anyways they stuck us at a table almost touching people's booths so they couldn't get out or in very easy. As we ordered, got drinks and talked it was nice. Then after about 40 minutes waiting for the food, we finally got it. Anddddd my food was completely cold. No much flavor, and I ordered a burger medium, and it was so much more well than I asked.  And the server kept slamming everyone's drinks and plates so hard on the table. It was ridiculous.  I will not be back, it was very disappointing.",

First off, love the happy hour prices/choices. I went with a friend and we ordered a round of appetizers and a pitcher of white peach sangria for $15 which I highly recommend!! Alright now, the food. THE FOOD. The hummus is creamy and flavorful with soft, warm pita bread. The buffalo chicken lollipops are basically chicken bites on a stick, but you can't go wrong with that! Order the sauce on the side if you're weary of spice. We also tried the hush puppies and sweet potato tater tots. Both delicious and the hush puppies are served with a zesty sauce! I wish I brought my dog, but I think my next visit I will so I can try the dog menu!",

We've tried all different items on the menu, even seasonally as they change, and have never had anything that wasn't delicious. The managers are incredible, Ursula (one of the managers) has checked on us on multiple occasions and remembered us when we came in. This place is welcoming, and has a perfect middle of the road atmosphere between bar and classy restaurant. The beer club is amazing, you get different craft brews every quarter and awesome swag. I don't know what else I can say besides we love it here and will keep coming back for years to come. I literally joined Yelp to write this review because this restaurant is incredible.",

I asked for the bread and the waitress said they don't have bread but they have a thin garlic flatbread it is served with.  Told her that was fine.  I was very disappointed the chicken, which is an \"add\" to the dish wasn't a grilled boneless chicken breast.  Instead it was a couple chunks of chicken mixed in.  It was horrible looking and tasting.  Then came the bread ... seems they were out so they brought me what looked like Pita bread with a ton of oil and cheese on it.  It had so much oil it was actually soggy.   Sent meal back and dismissed waitress and manager.  For the record ... Never sent a meal back in my life and certainly never chewed out staff!

Also had the crispy Brussels sprouts which were salty and drenched in Parmesan and just too overwhelming to enjoy. We also received complimentary flatbread which was awful and chewy like rubber. Honestly the only saving grace for me was the lemonade drinks which were delicious.",

Though the ingredients were very fresh the flavors were very overpowering to the tuna.  There was no sense of complimentary flavors.   I tasted either greens, or olive or tuna or a very strong dressing.  Melissa never asked me how my food was or offered another beverage.  Disappointing.  I like good service.

But the service here is so bad  I'd never return.  We had the butternut squash soup, chicken tortilla soup, chicken parmigiano with pasta and chicken teriyaki with rice all good though teriyaki was quite salty. But our server was terrible/non existent. Our server just didn't seem to give a damm.  Kudos to the nice young man who brought out our food.  Knowing the slim chance of us ever seeing our server again we asked him if we could get refills and he happily did so.  Then when he brought our entrees out and since we never got napkins or utensils from our server, he again  happily got this for us too. I wish I got his  name because he certainly is an asset and his kindness certainly stopped us from walking out.",

    "text": "Upon entering the Lazy Dog, I felt like it was a five star experience! This is the first time I've been, and we came in for an early Sunday dinner. Since it was Father's Day, I thought that the wait time would be a very long one but to my surprise we only waited for less than 10 min. It was packed inside (as well as the outside patio) but that didn't take away from the quality of the food or service. The ambiance is also really cozy, kinda like a modern cabin so that's a plus for me.  A special shout-out to Jaimie, our server! She provided outstanding service with a great attitude throughout our entire meal. She gave various recommendations from the drinks all the way to dessert, and was very patient and informative. She recommended that we also save room for dessert because everything on the menu is delicious! With that said, we decided to skip the appetizer because we noticed the very generous portions. We ordered the Black and blue burger which came with both blue cheese crumbles and dressing, the Bison burger which came with havarti cheese, and the Chicken Dinner. For drinks we got the House Beer Sampler and the Seasonal Peaches + Moonshine. The seasonal libation was quite fresh, though a tad strong but very tasty. I'd say that Hefeweizen is by far probably the best Hefe I've ever tasted--really smooth! Jaime mentioned that all their House beer comes from Golden Road brewery in California. I can't believe it, but we were actually able to save a little bit of room for dessert (which was on the house thanks to Jaimie) and decided on the Housmade Butter Cake which was beautifully topped with minted strawberry compote and vanilla bean ice cream--gorgeous and delectable! Similar to strawberry short cake which is one of my favorites :)  The only two things that would have made the experience a little better was if maybe they'd lower the music a tad because I felt like I had to shout across the table. The other thing was that the silverware and some of the glasses weren't the cleanest. Other than that, I'd like to come back here very soon!",

I have to say the menu did not disappoint!  They have a special seasonal/local menu and it was fantastic!  The street carrots were a huge hit with our table.  We also had the chicken pot pie, kids make-your-own pizzas, fish tacos, and the Cobb salad.  Everything was tasty!  And the service was good.  Great menu suggestions & very efficient!  Parking is readily available and free!  It's adjacent to Downtown Summerlin Shopping Center, so the perfect place for lunch when you are there for a day of shopping, too!",

Breakfast, lunch, & dinner. Ahi tartare in a jar, parmesan crisps, and the beer sampler. We did the pork shank and strawberry salad for dinner. We've also tried the Asian salad and bison burger. Best of all worlds.   This place is super dog friendly. If you're there for breakfast expect fur friends on the patio which has fire pits!!!",

Our server was Kala, she got us a appetizer to welcome us she recommended the nachos for a full appetizer, the bison meatloaf for my meal and my wife had the grilled steak salad & we loved everything. As full as we were, Kala told us we wouldn't regret trying the butter cake. She even put the strawberries and ice cream on the side so we can take the rest home without it getting all melted.  The manager kristy also stopped by the table to see how we enjoyed everything. The service was amazing and the food was out of this world, we will be back to see Kala very soon!  We will be back for happy hour to try some of the drinks!",

The service was very friendly. The problem was that we ordered the barbecue pizza and it was laden with barbecue sauce... just overdone... and wasn't very good because of that. I ordered the chicken pot pie which is one of my favorite things to eat and this is the first one I met that I will never order again and did not like. It was pretty awful. I cannot believe even the waitress told me that it was good. It's not good... It's nasty! My friend ordered the pot roast and that was pretty good. The prices are reasonable and the ambience is friendly.",

I ended up ordering the fish and chips but they have a variety of offerings so it's a good choice for varied eaters. I was trying to decide between a veggie burger, ribs or sandwich. Fish and chips won. I'm not a regular drinker but the drink menu made we want to try something. I had a Moscow mule which I've always wanted to try. It was pretty good. The one thing that I didn't like was that my fries were Luke and my fish was piping hot. Tells me the fries were sitting a while. Hot fries do not go unnoticed.",

Atmosphere is outstanding with the patio in the shadows of the beautiful Spring Mountains, and the modern architecture of downtown Summerlin. The staff are all excellent, with great service. The food is freshly made, and a lot is local. Also, it is one of the cheapest places you can eat! 7.50 for a 22 ounce microbrew, most entrees are 12-18 dollars. Absolutely great place to eat, and I don't even have a dog!!",

I'm not a fan of fish but my family loved the ahi jar. They weren't a fan of the pickled vegetables at the bottom of the jar, but the ahi with the avocado was delicious with the wonton chips. The hush puppies were meh. They were a little bland, and without the sauce on top of them, they would've been a no from me.   For my meal, i got the fried chicken dinner. It's so hard to rate this dish because the sauce that comes with the chicken had no flavor, i felt like the chicken would've been fine without it, but of course i drizzle all of the sauce all over my chicken without trying it first. The mash potatoes were like the hush puppies... pretty bland. But that's just my opinion.   For dessert, we the got butter cake, and for you sweet tooth's out there-- this was delicious! I'm not a huge fan of sweet, but my boyfriend and roommates are, and that was the best part of the night.   All in all, i gave this place a 4 out of 5 because you can bring your dog here and they have a menu for them!! So cute! I'll definitely bring my puppy here!",

Food definitely was well prepared and has superb flavor. I had the pork shank--a seasonal item--and my wife got the flat iron steak. We also got the buffalo cauliflower--again seasonal--and we finalized with the huckleberry apple pie (seasonal again:)). It wasn't bland or overpowering but came out hot and fresh with plenty of flavor. I could tell their kitchen takes pride in what they do.  Service wise, it was a tad slow. I'll give them benefit of the doubt as it was on an off night but everyone we interacted with was friendly.   The restaurant was well decorated and the atmosphere warm. Plenty of items on the menu but it wasn't overpowering.  We'll definitely be back!",

I didn't taste any vinegar or tomato or spice. I tasted fat. Lard. Butter. Bland, fatty meat sandwich. The bun was the only thing winning about it. That was until a fucking bug flew on my plate and landed on my bun. A type of fruit fly or something all up in my business. Just great. My dining partner had the Chicken Parm which completely fell flat as well. Maybe we ordered off the dog menu or something.   Speaking of dogs that's the only thing I like about this lazy place. Dog doors, dog theme, dogs can dine with you outside. I think they would be much better off turning this into a full on dog restaurant and dog park. The dogs would have a hard time writing reviews about their experience though. Dogs are so real so they would write bad reviews for this place, too I bet.   Overall I will not be fining here again. I believe this restaurant fell under the Yelpers free event equals shiny reviews category. Clearly I don't play for that team. Hated it!",

    "text": "(4.5)  Decided to come here for a Tuesday afternoon Happy Hour and was overall satisfied with the experience.  Have been to another Lucky Dog in California and I like this one better, probably cause it's newer.  Very pleasant upbeat atmosphere with 80s music playing in the background.  We didn't order any cocktails, however, really like the layout of their bar and have a great selection of beers on tap.  Also, appreciate the nod to local Vegas brewery Banger as they have their Jalapeno Hefe on tap.  Try it, it's really good.   So we ordered the boneless wings which were served on blue cheese slaw; really crunchy outside with tender chicken inside. Yum.  Just wish there was more slaw. The sweet potato tots were another bite of deliciousness with a zesty dipping sauce. Mmm.  Just note that some of the portions on happy hour are smaller compared to normal apps.  Didn't order any this time, but have tried the edamame before; really great with the spicy Asian flair.   My only complaint was my water glass was empty for 10 minutes; but had a nice time and  I look forward to coming back.",

The dog portion was pretty big so I asked them to half it and I took the other half home with me and had it for my dinner! The food for us was really tasty too. The only downside is that the dogs aren't allowed inside which I thought was a little odd, I thought the whole point of the restaurant was to bring your dog along. But we sat outside and had a great time! Thank you!",

From time to time, there's been a bad apple in terms of not being very attentive to our table, but overall I truly love coming to this restaurant!   First, this place is just so fun because I can bring my big, black lab along with me to dinner, which is always a treat. Most places (even if they are 'dog friendly') really only cater to small dogs. This makes my 100 lb hard to bring along. This place does not shy away though! They have a lovely outdoor seating area that is very spacious. You never feel cramped or uncomfortable outside as they have shades/fans/heaters for all types of weather. To top it off they even have a small 'doggy' menu for your fur-baby to eat from. They automatically provide water for your dog as well, you don't even need to ask it just comes out with your own drinks.   Speaking of menus, the people menu is very large and offers a ton of variety. This is always great because we like to come here frequently, and being able to try plenty of new dishes is always a huge plus. To add to this, the food is just delicious. I've had everything from pasta and salads, to burgers and pot pies. Each item has been wonderfully delicious. They do offer a full bar as well and have many fun house cocktails to choose from. They also offer house brews (which I adore).   Overall if you love dogs, and good 'home cooked' style food, I highly recommend this place.",

Super nice and we noticed that she really was a hard worker. Our server, Christina W. (I think that was her name lol Tall short black haired woman) was pretty bad. She's the only reason why this isn't a 5 star review. Took her 15 minutes to even acknowledge us. My boyfriend and I are some what heavy drinkers and I know had she been more attentive, we would have ordered 3-4 more rounds but since she was MIA, guess not. Which was really strange to us because when we would see her, she wasn't busy or running around. She was just kinna strolling around.  But anyways, would definitely come back. Just would like a different server haha",

We came in around 9 pm and ordered the deviled eggs, mac n cheese, and fried chicken dinner. Split all three. Darlene was our server, and let me tell you, this woman was, is, and always will be an angel sent from god. She IMMEDIATELY got to it with drinks while we looked over the menu. I got a strawberry citrus soda, and she noticed I hadnt really touched it. This wonderful woman went ahead and made me some delicious ass drink that she invented. I loved it since it had raspberry in it (my fav). Food comes, and she was sweet enough to have our food split up to make it easy. Of course, food was great. We order the Smores brownie sundae and she brought it over to us with raspberry coulis bc i said its my favorite !! I wanted to cry because of how dedicated she was to making our experience great. Before Darlene, i already knew id return. Now, i'll be returning for her wonderful service and personality.",

Alright for a group, to watch the big game and root for your team, but for dinner with family and trying to carry on a conversation, forget it, I feel like I had to shout to be heard!  The chicken palbano is slighty spicy, both times ( I had it last time, mother in law had it this time) there was just enough heat, spice and ratio of peppers to chicken.   The burger was huge cooked just a little to long and was just a tad on dry side for medium cook, lots of blue cheese, fries could have been fresher.   I had chicken tortilia soup, very cheesy and big chunks of chicken, moist and tender shreds, served with wedge of flat bread, pretty good! And I had the warm chicken Focaccia sandwich, moist chicken, plenty and stacked with lettus and tomato.   For apps we had sweet potato tatter tots with a yummy dipping sauce lime cilanto and roasted brussel sprouts with capers and bread crumble, both good size and very good.   Both visits had good servive but this trip the server missed the opportunity to sell us dessert, bringing our check to fast without asking! But the butter cake is a must have ( had it our first visit), overall good place for food, drinks, friends.",

    "text": "It brings me such pleasure and yet such pain to finally write this review.  Why?  Because I'm further promoting what could possibly be the best dessert of any restaurant I've ever had ever and I wanted to keep it to myself.     Our experience here was great.  The food was delicious and the service was top notch.  Lazy Dog was the perfect place to sit down for dinner and take a break from all the shopping we did around downtown Summerlin.     Lazy Dog has a wide range of food that was offered on their menus.  Pastas, meats, wok-fried foods, Hawaiian style ribs,  ahi tuna entrees, burgers, seafood, brunch foods, and so much more.  If you're trying to feed a group of diverse tastes, you will have no problem finding the perfect something for everyone.  My pot roast over mashed potatoes with sauteed spinach was amazingly good.  The meat was so tender and flavorful and the hearty gravy complimented it and the mashed potatoes very well.  There was so much in this one dish that I had to ask for a box to take home.    My wife had the sundried tomato pesto pasta with a hefty portion of sliced chicken breast.  The flavors of their walnut-pesto cream sauce mixed with the tossed mushrooms, onions, and broccoli make this another winning entree.    Onto their desserts:   1) Butter Cake-  \"Don't resuscitate me.  I've died and gone to heaven.\"  Home-made butter cake topped with strawberry compote and a scoop of vanilla ice cream surrounded by a sweet balsamic reduction.  This simple dessert filled me with such warmth and joy with each bite.  The butter cake was so delicious that I can't even type without pausing to stop myself from drooling.  I left the restaurant thinking and dreaming about my next time having this.  (Soon!  Townsquare location incoming!)    2) Kid's meal \"Create your own Sundae\"-  This was a very fun take on a sundae.  A large bowl of ice cream was accompanied by side dishes filled with sprinkles, nuts, chocolate, and caramel.  My daughter was able to decorate her ice cream as she pleased.  She loved it.  My only question is how was this less than $3 ?!?  It was MASSIVE!  Truly, any kid's sweet dream come True.   I can't wait for their second location in Town Square to open up as it's much closer to me than their Summerlin Location.   Until then,  I will gladly drive out of my way again for such a great meal.",

Moving from Los Angeles where almost every restaurant has a patio and is pet friendly, I was so happy to hear about this place!  My party of 4 (3 plus a dog) showed up for lunch at around 11:30am. The hostess saw us from afar once we parked and walked towards us to greet us warmly. This was such a nice gesture. It really made us feel welcome, especially since it was all of our first time coming to the restaurant. We were seated immediately and introduced to put server. I wish I got everyone's name but I was too busy running around making sure Hilo (my dog) was secured appropriately (his leash tied to a chair). The server was very professional, very nice and accommodating. He brought out a water bowl for the dog immediately.  The server brought out a complimentary flat bread for first timers, which was very tasty. We ordered an Poke Bowl, Ahi Tuna Salad, Hawaiian Ribs with fries, Edamame, and a Tuna and Walnut Sandwich. All great choices but my absolute favorite were the ribs! Definitely a must try!!!  Before our meal came out, the manager also introduced himself to us. The staff really goes above and beyond to make sure everyone feels welcomed and it did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.  Hilo my dog is on a raw diet so he unfortunately could not try anything from the dog menu but we will definitely be coming back as he loved the restaurant and the staff!!!",

    "text": "The most disgusting patio in summerlin....  It's so sad when they have the best real estate in downtown summerlin.....it's dirty, food all over the floor from previous tables, I don't think I saw one busser that was only just zoned for the patio(which they should at all times) ever come outside just to at least buss tables or remove glasses and dirty plates that were sitting around the fire pit....servers and managers walking past dirty areas for almost 2 hours and never once grab anything to clean up anything. I love dogs and having lunch with them are great but seeing empty doggie bowls all over the patio and not one person pick up just at least one was ridiculous.   The service was really horrible it just sad because it's such a great place to enjoy the summer patio and I would never go back again....my best advice would be schedule a busser that only takes care of the patio at all times so people can actually enjoy a clean patio with smiling dogs.....",

Peeked out on the patio and saw a nice fire pit and several canine pals dining with their people.  Menu price and selection is excellent.  Our server was Finn and she was outstanding.  Her great service alone would have been enough reason to come back, but coupled with the good food, it made for a totally winning evening. We will definitely try to sit in her section again.  I'd also like to note all the staff members were pleasant and friendly.  So many good menu choices to please everyone from appetizers to small plates to entrees.  My partner chose the pot roast dip sandwhich with red mashed potatoes.  I had a small bite of the pot roast and it was tender and so good.  I chose the cast iron turkey meatballs with pine nuts, marinara, mozzarella,  and basil.  Even though it was a small plate, it could easily be considered as a filling small stand alone meal.  For my next visits, I have my eye on the cast iron trout and the bison meatloaf.  Definitely recommend this as an upscale casual experience that won't break the bank.  I also look forward to possibly dining with my little guys and girl (dogs) here soon.",

I don't drink but my guys enjoyed some good adult beverages at good, happy hour prices.   We sat on the patio, the weather was great and it was beautiful. Very nice and clean and well kept.   The service was also really good. Ended up getting pretty busy as our party of 10 sat there from about 3-6.  I loved the fact that there were so many dogs there. I can wait to bring my pup back with me next time. They bring out a water bowl and even have a dog food menu. It's awesome.  I ordered the sweet and spicy shrimp. It was delicious. The waitress recommended it and I saw a ton of photos of it here on Yelp so I knew it would be a good look. Absolutely was. So try it!",

Everyone in my party received their food (a cold of the dishes very cold) and my burger came about 10 minutes after. It was cold meat but the top bun was warm from the heat lamps. Manager of course to the table asked if I wanted them to make a new burger (I declined since who knows the cooks do once you return food) and Manager didn't even apologize or say anything else. Too bad for this lazy dog. Might try the other LD in Vegas.",

Their brand beer was just ok, not the best. But you do get a mini 6 pack sampler to try them all. They are even labeled with little dog tags. Very cute.

We visited twice this week; both kind of \"off-peak\" times and on both occasions our food was delivered late and cold.  The first visit was a Sat. at 11 am.  Our table of 3 all ordered breakfast items.  My two dining companions had almost finished their entrees before mine even arrived.  The staff recognized the issue and deducted my entree from the bill.  Our second visit was a Sat. afternoon at 4.  We waited almost 30 min for our entrees to arrive ( burgers) and then they arrived barely warm.  Again, the management recognized we had been waiting too long and offered a free dessert.  The food is fine, the atmosphere upbeat but don't go if you are in a hurry.",

    "text": "Horrible. We were sat within the 15-20 minute wait time they quoted, outside with our pup and there was a dirty bowl of water and dirty bowl of rice on the ground under our table still not picked up. Fine. We ordered our drinks and food as well as new clean water for the dog with our waitress.  first up was our soup. It was very bland, and I had to add a generous amount of hot sauce to flavor it. At this point we didn't have silverware or napkins, only the soup spoon that had come with the soup which was a bit messy because of all the melted cheese. The water for the pup still wasn't out yet so I asked the food runner to please get us some. We sat and chatted for a while after we were done with our soups and before our main dish came.  When the main dishes came we still didn't have silverware or napkins. My friend had to ask for them, and when they came they were filthy. My first bite into the pot roast was cold! The gravy was dried up and you could tell just by the sight of it that it had been sitting out quite a while.  I let the waitress know it was cold, but it seemed like we always had to get her attention because she didn't even bother to check on us.  I didn't like the pot roast at all, it was cold to begin with. The second time around the gravy was not a solid, so I could see that it was at least warm but so so dry. I could barely eat it. We tried to quickly get over the horrible entree and order dessert which was not so bad, but the spoons were soooo dirty- like food gunk crusted on it dirty. After we finished we wanted to get the hell out of there because it seemed like we were there forever and we were- Almost two hours. We waited for her to come back to check on us, clear the table, and drop our check but she wasn't around. I stood up and just remained standing until she saw I needed the check asap so we could leave. She finally noticed me, and gave me the \"I'll be right with you.\"  It was probably 5 minutes after that, that our check was dropped.  I wanted to use a credit card but I knew that would have taken years to accomplish with this service so I paid cash. I won't be returning to this place, the food was not good, and the service was awful!!!!!!",

Tonight we decided to go there with friends before we left for a road trip with our dog. Super convenient to be able to bring your dog, albeit a little hot. First thing we did was ask for some ice water for four. The person who seated us said she was only a hostess and couldn't get us water. We waited another few minutes and our server came out. We asked for water as soon as possible, and some for our dog. It was about 105 degrees out, cooling off but not fast enough. After waiting for 12 minutes (I checked my phone as I texted our friends when we arrived), we still had no water and we decided to leave. When we got up and started to walk out our server finally came out, so we asked to speak with the manager. After waiting again in the heat for a few more minutes we walked inside and approached the host desk. The manager was standing there and hadn't been told to come see us. We made our complaint and she offered to get our drink orders. We told her we hadn't even ordered drinks, just some water because of the insane heat. She then repeated her offer to get us drink orders as if she hadn't heard us. As locals with continued bad service here I can't say when I'll be ready to return...",

First we had to wait because we had six people and the Manager \"Melissa\" must \"approve\" all groups over 5-which the employees all discussed in front of us and I found to be weird and very uncomfortable as did they.  The food took a long time-service was friendly but slow.  Wrong dishes from other tables were waved in front of us.  The chicken pot pie was the worst we have ever had-no veggies that we could see and at the end after discussing our take home order portion, the waitress still got it wrong.  Needless to say it was a long grueling experience with poor but friendly service.  The manager-GM did come by and apologize (then more mistakes were made) and give us a partial credit.  The decor is nice. The Tater Tots are good. The specialty drinks are nice.  Fun place to take a dog. I will re evaluate the next time I visit.  The staff needs to be trained.  The worst part was at the end when my 6 year old had to go to the rest room and went in to a stall to be told to wait (as he was already in it) by a young lady who wanted to put toilet paper in all of the stalls-there was already toilet paper in it and she could have started on another stall.  Obviously she doesn't have kids or she wouldn't tell a 6 year old to wait for such a silly reason when she could have done another stall.  Plain silly and rude.  Lack of common sense.",

    "text": "A swing and a big miss. Now I know that this place was named after the head chef. Although the restaurant is very nicely appointed, and the brioche bun was quite nice, everything else fell short. Nachos with chicken marinated in salsa verde came wet and soggy. We ordered all the sauces on the side because we like chips to be crispy. But the chicken was soaked in green sauce, which made the whole pile a soggy, wet mess. Yuck. The burger, on that very nice bun, was a totally uninspired frozen patty, which was ordered medium, came out red inside and cold (not not warm, actually cold) inside. Disgusting. Fries were the most basic, unseasoned, dull fries you could imagine. Absolutely forgettable and without a drop of creativity. And, no manager ever checked on our table even though we saw three of them and it was not busy. Great location, nice looking place, nice looking menu, total flop for us.",

    "text": "The manager really went out of his way to keep us happy after the waitress got my order wrong.  Instead of letting me sit there with no food while everyone else in my party was eating their meals the manager asked if I would like a cup of one of their soups or a small salad while I waited for my correct order to be brought out.  So I accepted a cup of the Chicken Tortilla soup.  It was really good.  The dish I had ordered, the Chimichurri Mahi Mahi finally came out and it was really worth the wait!  The fish was fresh and cooked perfectly, the chimichurri was flavorful and the vegetables perfectly complimented the fish.  Excellent!  And they even accommodated our request for a hot drink.  It was really cold out and we wanted a hot drink that wasn't coffee, so when we asked if they could serve their Apple Cider drink warm they did just that.  The manager came by to make sure we were all happy with our food and listened to our suggestion that they offer hot drinks in the winter.  Overall we were very happy with our food and experience and will definitely go back again.",

    "text": "We now have 2 Lazy Dog locations in Vegas and I must say that this one is a lot better than the one on the strip. We came in for a business lunch and it was pretty dead. A large group was able to order and get their food pretty quickly. The waiter was attentive and always coming back to the table to see if we needed anything or to refill our drinks. I think this one is a lot slower than the one at Town Square and I like it a lot better. They don't run out of food like I've had happen before. Tho, I did have them get my drink order wrong a couple of times in the past so I had to sit and wait for them to remake it. I got the beef dip sandwich this time and it was pretty good. Fries need some seasoning or something on them tho. They were pretty bland. I love the decor at this place and I love how you can bring your dog and eat with them on the patio. I haven't brought mine yet since she's a puppy and doesn't have the best dinner etiquette, so I can't write about the patio yet, but I do love the idea knowing I can when she's ready.",

Great dipping sauce. Rather hard and greasy for my taste.   Martini. 4 Stars. Great unique flavor.   Ribs: quite sweet. Quantity of meat on the bone-very very sparse. The side of fries had a fancy name ( umami) w.t.frick, They were mediocre Applebee's,Red Robin quality. not worth eating I expected more fir the price.   Pork shank. Flavor great. Quantity of meat.....adequate, yet the surface of the pork was dry. I expected better for  the price.  The pork rested on a side of spicy Kimchee flavored rice. Way too spicy and was a serious detractor to the pork. Not. Good match  Pork shank is a more delicate flavor imho. Polenta or cous cous , lightly, or not at all spiced would've been a better , and less costly food marriage.  I walked out tasting kimchee flavor on my palate , not pork.   I think it's a food sin to plate a main, with a side that is stronger.   Two mains  One appetizer  Three drinks  99.00 plus 20 tip.   120.00 was way to much for what  we ate.   It's an 80 dollar experience. Not 120.  Not planning on returning. Again..  \"Based on the owners website and marketing effort  ( great marketing) ( got-me in the door )I expected  More than ambiance.  I expected food you'd be proud to wow your friends with.",

    "text": "I've been to Lazy Dogs at Town Square several times, but this was my first time at the location in Summerlin. Came on a Saturday night around 7:00pm and were able to be seated immediately. It is a pretty big restaurant with a large patio area where people are able to eat with their dogs. There was a decent sized crowd for a Saturday night. The menu is comparable to Cheesecake Factory where they literally have a little bit of everything, so many options it can be overwhelming. We started with drinks - pineapple mojito and sangria sampler. The sangria samplers was ~$9 and came with three little mason jars of peach sangria, raspberry sangria and Im not sure what the other one was, it just tasted like iced red wine to me. My favorite was the raspberry for sure. I took a sip of the mojito and it was pretty good. For food we ordered a Spicy Thai chicken salad, really good (but I have had it before) and a turkey burger. The fries seemed as if they were cooked earlier this afternoon, mushy and cold. Service was good after we had to wait 7 minutes to have our drink orders taken our server was on top of it from then out. The bill was around $50 which isn't too bad. If you sign up for their reward program you get a free appetizer / dessert. Also they have free wifi! Overall good experience.",

Dog diners are only allowed on the patio so if you prefer to be away from the 4 legged lovers, you have the option to eat inside. The menu is basic, offering sandwiches, burgers and chicken/beef entrees. The also offer weekend brunch until 2pm. For the pups the servers bring out water and you have the option to purchase chicken and rice, hamburger and rice or a bowl of rice for their lunch. I always order the turkey and havarti sandwich on herb focaccia bread for myself. They have other great options but I just love this sandwich.  The patio fills up fast on weekends so expect a small wait. It's nice to know I have somewhere to take my boys after the park for a nice lunch before work. Not all dogs get along but for the most part it's peaceful. I do appreciate the \"dog rules\" of no barking, biting or begging and they are not allowed to sit at the table or eat off human plates.  Whether you are a dog lover, dog owner or neither this restaurant accommodates to all. Great food, great atmosphere and great prices!",

    "text": "Came here last night with my wife and my pug for a late dinner as a continuation of my pooch's 2nd Birthday meal of the day. We came around 7:30 or so and were promptly seated. Initially we were seated by our hostess at a small table for two, but asked our waiter if we could move to a larger table where it would be more comfortable for us since the patio area (which is for patrons who are dining with dogs) was mostly empty. The waiter happily obliged us.  I've eaten at Lazy Dog's before with friends, but this was the first time I've been here since I became a dog owner and thus it was my first time dining in the patio area. Overall the patio area was nice. There were other patrons with their dogs, there was plenty of seating, several tv's, and a fire pit in the center.  Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and accommodating. He took our orders for the pot roast and fish tacos. We also ordered a hamburger patty w/ brown rice for our pooch. He even asked us if we wanted all the dishes to come out at the same time, to which we said yes. Our dishes came out after about 10-15 minutes. I enjoyed the pot roast along with its gravy and the mashed potatoes and spinach that it came with. I just wish there was a little bit more of the pot roast because I was really hungry. My wife enjoyed the fish tacos and the Spanish rice it came with. My dog on the other hand, didn't really touch his food, but that's mainly because my pug is very finicky and it was served in a plate that was unfamiliar to him. That and he probably didn't like brown rice it came with (though he has no issue at all with white rice). Once we got home, he had no problem with the hamburger patty and ate it with zest.   Overall, we enjoyed our first meal with our pug at Lazy Dog's and would like to return.",

She even made sure to let us know in this busy night that the seating at the bar area was first come first served in case we didn't want to wait.  The person who delivered our food was also super nice. Unfortunately, there was a chatty waitress who would not stop talking with us. She kept telling long stories to the point of things getting awkward. Now don't get me wrong, I don't mind the quick joke or chat with the wait staff, but when my girlfriend and I are both taking bites out of our burgers, it's time to hit the road. Very weird staring at you while chewing.  Keep the anecdotes under 2 minutes, please.  There was also a hostess who wasn't so friendly.  Just an attitude that really made you feel like she didn't care at all. It also seemed awkward for nobody to say \"bye\", or \"come again\", or \"thanks for choosing Lazy Dog\" when there were like 7 employees that you had to walk by to leave.   THE FOOD:  Food was really good. Not 5-star good, but I'd say a four. I was a bit upset that they were out of 9 of like 25 draft beers.  Not sure why that was the case.    We had the loaded potato hush puppies. Really good. I'd say a 4 of 5. Mac n cheese. 5 of 5. Definitely good.  My blue cheese burger was solid. 4 of 5. Girlfriends pasta was, I thought, 3 of 5. But I'm also picky about pasta.  Overall, it was a good experience.  And the food was good. Not spectacular, but definitely good.",

I'm still thinking about it.",

My wife ordered the Turkey Sandwich, the bread was stele and turkey was dry and we asked for no Mayo and can see where they put Mayo on the bread and then wiped off.  Just a poor attempt at a turkey sandwich.  I also order the sweet & spicy Wok Chicken stir.  The chicken was tough and really over cooked and the veggies were raw and not cooked.   The sweet corn chowder was good! Our overall food experience was crappy!  I really wish I could say the serving staff were friendly and we had great service.  However the young lady Samantha who waited us was not real friendly, didn't smile or communicate with us.  Her  nonverbal expressions were negative and she came a cross like she didn't like us or her job, if we were to go back to the Lazy Dog we would ask not to sit in her section.  I don't expect to going back any time soon!",

I LOVE the scratch kitchen everything is so fresh! The POT PIE is amazing and has the perfect amount of sauce, where it was not over powering leaving out ingredients. I love the Pasta and the chicken wraps!  The price was the best part. They are not trying to make anyone go broke here - they are very reasonable which allowed us to order drinks and dessert freely.

We complained about all the apps because they were not very good at all and did get a nice \"thanks for your feedback\".  I had the new schnitzel and it was awful.

    "text": "Ahhh.. Another restaurant opens in Downtown Summerlin, one can go broke sampling all the restaurants that are located here. My newest adventure is Lazy Dogs located just outside of Red Rock Casino. It's like BJ's if I was going to compare it to another restaurant. You enter next to a beautiful bar that's set up nicely for happy hour. The restaurant is large and open with beautiful open beams that I always like. Once seated our server was very nice and took care of us well during our meal. The menu isn't as extensive as BJ's but that's not a bad thing either. One can get lost in a large menu and personally I like one smaller and hits all the points which Lazy Dogs does. The Ahi Poke severed on 4 crispy fried wontons was an excellent starter. Our main dishes were the Pot Roast French Dip, which was outstanding. I never thought to take moms pot roast and making a French dip out of it. So much better than thinly sliced beef. And the aujus, superb, it tasted like it was made from the Pot Roast itself and not some watered down beef boulon. Second dish was the hand formed Turkey Burger with avocado. Sorry, I love a good turkey burger and this version was good, not great but good. The Sweet Potato Tots on the other hand were some of the best I've ever had anywhere and I'd take them over a stack of fries any day. Overall I like Lazy Dogs for its open feeling good service and smaller precise menu. Four Stars for the establishment I'd give it Five if the Turkey Burger was a bit better.",

Amy, our server greeted us on a very timely manner with a beautiful and welcoming smile. She had no problem in grabbing me a sample of the red ale they have on tap, that they brew themselves. We ordered a couple small plates such as the hush puppies (10/10) Brussel sprouts, and meatballs. All were quite delicious. My boyfriend also got a Ceasars salad and the pulled pork sandwich, the Apple cider vinegar in the Cole slaw is a great touch. All in all we are very happy costumers and we will surely be back!

I was impressed by the speed and thought my dish was phenomenal. After we got the food, we barely saw our waitress. I did have to ask some other member of the wait staff for a refill so that's where the -1 star comes in. I understand if your busy, but don't just pop back up with the check at the end.

I only give it 4 stars because I went around 12 and it was a slower time so not sure how their service would be on a busier time. I brought my dog with me so he can feel special and it was nice to find a nice restaurant that allows dogs. We sat outside fast and great service from the start, I acknowledge the rules for my dog even though seeing another dog he almost ruined it ha but he learned to behave there and just lay down until food came. The pricing for food and what you get from it was well worth it. It gave you the fancy atmosphere with out the expensive pricing you think to expect. I would definitely recommend this to my friends with dogs to go to even if you don't have dogs I would say give it a try too, I'm just not sure how it is during a busier time how everything is.",

    "text": "Heads up: DOG LOVER HERE and I love to take my guys (two yellow labs) wherever I go... within reason... but when a place like this is beyond hound friendly and even has a mini menu for your four legged friend/family member(s).  I'm that guy who's hounds are so well behaved, they outshine a lot of  people... I mean, they sit, they stay and they are chill... even in a restaurant where there's food passing every minute, stuff going on and people trying to capture their attention to let me know how adorable they are... yeah, they are pretty cool pups.   The ONLY thing that bugs me is people who can't read (they have a 3 Rule Policy) and they think 'their' dog is awesome... BUT, it Barks, Begs and/or misBehaves ... wake up folks...your dogs need a little training BEGORE you bring them here! I recently sat next to a table where I knew the dog's name within the first 90 seconds of sitting there because the owners said it 31 times... Word of advice: your dog doesn't belong here... yet! Maybe try a little socializing before you go... This is not a place to 'see' if your dog is going to lunge at every dog that passes or bark at everything... including air. It's called LAZY DOG... it means CHILL... not 'bring your dog and train him/her while everyone tries to eat lunch.'   Other than my soapbox for the dog owners... Food is great... even the Hound Menu and the service is always SUPER FRIENDLY!",

    "text": "First time dining here in my area/Summerlin...the menu looked decent and fair pricing so I was looking forward to a nice meal. I'll give you the good and the not so good. Our waitress was nice but either she didn't listen or somehow they messed up in the kitchen. First of all she said is avocado ok in your tortilla soup. Now I don't hate it but I assumed it was already IN the soup and if I didn't want it I cud always just take it off. I got my bill and we were both charged $1.50 for literally maybe two tiny slices of avocado! Not happy. There was only two shredded pieces of chicken in my \"chicken tortilla soup\" where exactly was the chicken facet?! Ugh. We decided we are just going to make it ourselves at home and actually put chicken in it. Sigh. If you're going to up charge a customer PLEASE tell them up front! I can't stand surprises on the bill. I was too Tired to even deal but we were both not happy. My chicken Caesar salad was actually decent even though I specifically said when I ordered \"just a couple of croutons please\" As u can see in the photo it was like they dumped the entire bag on my salad ugh. Again not enough chicken and overdose of croutons. Where the mishap occurred I'm not sure but my guests said they def heard me order it correctly. I just want to enjoy a meal and not have hiccups along the way or be charged for something I didn't even want and assumed it was already IN the soup by the manner in which she she said it. You don't get to mislead customers by phrasing terms differently that's super shady. It's not going to make me Tip more bc you up charged the heck out of us for menial side items. I always tip 20% or more but those issues make me second guess my choice in going back to eat there again. I'm trying to find some go to places in Summerlin & honestly I was judisappointed in this experience. Please listen to your customers and do not try to up sell them with random $2 charges. Overall more chicken in the chicken tortilla soup and chicken Caesar salad. Update: Gen Man reaches out and I did go back but honestly they messed up the croutons this time I got a ton and my friend got None. I give up on that meal. We ordered chicken nachos-barely any chicken a couple shredded scattered pieces and we said NO coijita cheese bc my guest can NOT have it! It came with the cheese ugh. He didnt get to eat any. Where was the cheese? You cant have nachos without cheese! Just sad bc its an easy skip to get there here in Summerlin and we have just been disappointed too many times. I swear either no one listens or the chef/staff just dont care bc its always wrong. Thats's not an ransom accident thats become a bad habit now. We tried. :( The new waiter Randy (?) was nice and he wasnt even our waiter-everything was too long of a wait-awaited forever for the app, waited forever for the meal, waited forever for the check. Just left a bad taste in our mouths unfortunately.",

    "text": "We chose this spot for a little get together Sunday brunch and it was so perfect.   I chose to go with a glass of the red moscato sangria and the baked huckleberry pancake. The sangria was light and full of fruit. The pancake is ginormous and is truly baked in a skillet with huckleberry and raspberry puree mixed in. While the pancake is monstrous, it's light and fluffy, so I did manage to finish almost all of it. The syrup that comes with the pancake is bacon infused and adds a smokey and salty taste to the pancake (and a little goes a long way).   The service was great, we were never left searching for our waiter and he was super friendly. The restaurant was ok with our balloon bouquet that we brought along and tied to a couple of the chairs as well. I'd recommend an earlier brunch, there wasn't many people in the restaurant when we arrived at 10am, but come 11/11:30am it got much more crowded.   All around, I'd recommend coming for the weekend brunch (I want to come back to try the bacon & egg Mac & cheese and the donut holes). I'm also looking forward to coming back for lunch because the rest of the menu looked really good too.",

If you visit Lazy Dogs I know you will have great service but if you get Austin it will be just a little bit better.   On a side note, please try the pig candy grilled cheese. This is an appetizer and is probably the best appetizer ever. If you have more than two in your party, I recommended ordering a few of these. Kudos to the chef that created this masterpiece.

We were seated right by a fireplace which was perfect for this cold snow flurry weather in Las Vegas this evening. I have to give a shout out to Olivia who provided impeccable service during our dinner. She was so polite and welcoming. Olivia recommended the Deep Fried Deviled Egg appetizer which I highly recommend. Our entrees included Fetuccini Alfredo, pot roast, fish and chips, kids mac and cheese, and kid corn dogs. These were all a perfect choice for the evening. We look forward to returning and hope to have Olivia and her stellar service again soon!",

    "text": "Not a good experience. It was not busy and we waited over 20minutes for a table. They kept saying sorry like they forgot at the front. We finally sit down and the server had us waiting for such a long time that we had to flag down someone to just take our order, because we had two babies in high chairs getting antsy. When the server came, he had sarcastic comments when asked about menu items and disappeared again for some time. Someone else brought out the food. I asked about the hummus I ordered because it looked watery and discolored. The random employee said \"I don't like hummus, but this one should be good.\" He then walked away. Needless to say, I put it aside. Finally, our food came. Food was not bad, but our sever looked offended when someone at my table didn't like the dessert they ordered. Waited a long time for the check, and finally when I paid, our server charged me for a completely different amount that was given. About a $20 difference. I had to go find him, in which he looked bothered that I came up to him. Should have gotten the manager. We proceeded to wait and wait while he figured it out and said he fixed it, and he's sorry. Walked away and had me checking my account to see if the charge would change. Definitely not going back.",

    "text": "Lazy dogs has a very similar vibe to BJ's. Much more laid back though and of course who doesn't like dogs?!  I really really dig the downtown Summerlin location the other one not so much! The down town Summerlin location always has better chefs. I went Wednesday December the 27th with a reservation for 5pm. Everything was on point and super delicious! Even the customer service was amazing! Our waiter took great care of us even though she didn't introduce herself but that doesn't matter because she was doing a phenomenal job. I also ordered a ginger ale and whiskey and was surprised to get not that but something better and new lol. They gave me whiskey with a ginger simple syrup, I now have a new drink if the place I'm at is as fancy as lazy dogs and decides to carry ginger simple syrup lol.  Anyways they always have new recipes on their menus as well as seasonal deserts and appetizers or starters. They had a crazy twist on elotes pretty much instead of corn they used hair loom carrots and I loved it.  Also decided to get their version of pad Thai and it was nice to get something like that out of a place like lazy dogs totally unexpected! The shrimp was cooked perfectly again the chef back their was really taking their time everything was super good! I highly recommend this location over the town square one. Town squares location needs to up their game.  It was funny to think because I went to the town square location first I kinda really disliked lazy dogs. Yesterday night I was dragged their by family and I'm kinda glad I was. Because the downtown Summerlin location took my bitterness away. I now love lazy dogs",

We ordered lunch for ourselves and something for the pup,  Our meals came out in a timely fashion but our pups meal was late in showing up, Joelle took the initiative to make sure that our pup got his meal,  She made sure that our drink glasses were always full and was always making sure that all was well for everyone.  Joelle should be seen as a shining example of what an excellent waitress should practice especially with regard to customer care and service.  This was our first time at the lazy Dog, but I guarantee you that it will not be our last.  Thank you, Joelle, for a great dining experience.",

First, the outside seating has fans and an A/C unit thingy making this Vegas heat tolerable while sitting outside. That leads me to the second best thing, super duper dog friendly!!! Not only do they invite dogs to hang out they have a menu for the puppers too! The drinks are awesome, happy hour is legit, and the servers are super friendly. On top of all this, the food is great.

They should take their chats to the back and out of view.   The waiter we had on our last visit unfortunately was horrible!

Considering how hot it gets here, the shaded patio isn't too bad especially since they have the mist fans on for most of the day. I ended up getting the sticky ribs & umami fries. The ribs were average and weren't exactly hot when they arrived, but fell right off the bone. The honey plum sauce on the ribs was just the right amount of sweet. I wasn't too crazy about the fries though. I would definitely go back for a drink or some lunch and bring my dog along. They also have a dog menu which is just precious!!",

We waited 15mins for a waitress to come by, but to no avail. Another group were sat at the same time as us and were seen to, ordered and started to receive food and we were still not being acknowledged so we moved to a different area for hope a different server could dissipate our rumbling stomachs! After another long 10mins the manager could see I was frustrated and came over to take our order. After about 45 mins we finally got some food and it was ok. Standard for a bar and definitely not worth the wait. Next time I'll be cutting my losses and trying somewhere else.",

I'm sure their shirts are uncomfortable!  PLEASE CHANGE THE SHIRT!!   Lots of tv's with any game on. It's clean, in downtown Summerlin,  so you can eat and walk around, or vice versa. Great location!

    "text": "3.5 Stars: Very Good:    Lazy Dog is a California - based casual family owned restaurant chain that opened this 10,696 square foot restaurant in late 2014 (Eater Las Vegas). Despite its roots southwest of Las Vegas in Southern California it's inspiration is northeast of Las Vegas in the snow capped mountains of Jackson's Hole, Wyoming. Owner Chris Simms was a fan of the ski lodge where he would spend a plentiful of time in a place that had warmth and excitement. He came up with starting a restaurant that resembles a ski lodge. It is fitting that he was getting into the restaurant business since his parents started Miami's Cafe. Chris Simms was also inspired by a lazy dog that hung out in the lodge. Here is an excerpt from the Lazy Dog website:  \" Where did the Lazy Dog name come from? One snowy afternoon, walking back into the lodge after a long morning on the slopes, Chris noticed a dog lying by the toasty fireplace. Commenting to his buddies on how much he loved his time hanging out there, he told them he wished everyone could enjoy life as much as that \"lazy dog' by the fire.\"    I am also a fan of the lodge. Unfortunately Red Rock Canyon a spot where I hike, is in need of a lodge. Fortunately this replica of a lodge is a few miles east in the northwest quadrant of downtown Summerlin closer to Red Rock Casino than to Macy's. Recently, we'd end up here twice after Red Rock Canyon.    The visits started out fresh with plenty of parking. The nearby seasonal ice skating rink compliments the lodge theme.     As soon as we walked in I noticed a wire statue of a dog. Adorning the walls there are more pictures of dogs. And toward the back by the open kitchen there is another wire dog statue. Until I read the back story, I was thinking,  \"what  is the deal with all these dog pictures?\" I was impervious to the fact that there is a dog friendly patio where the food is for the people and the dogs.      My food wasn't for the dogs. On both post-hiking meals, I ordered off the lunch special. On the first visit I spent $8.50 on the chicken parmesan with pasta and on the second I spent $8.50 on the fired-wok chicken over rice. This was before the fountain beverage. The food was good. Missing from the Lazy Dogs dining experience is complimentary house bread. The scenery makes up for it.      True to Chris Simm's intentions the inside resembles a lodge. My eyes took in an interior design that merges urban with lodge. In the center is a large bar adorned with a sundry of flat screen TV. In the back is the open kitchen. Through out the restaurant are the dog pictures and statues. There is one wall near the rest rooms that is adorned with license plates. Just like a lodge there is plenty of space in a room with a moderate to low noise level.      Walking from one dog picture adorned wall to the other were the servers. In similar fashion to the dogs in the pictures, they smiled. The servers were friendly and efficient.      My return factor is foreseeable. In the near future I would like to try their newer and second location that opened up in Town Square. In writing this review I am spreading the word that Lazy Dog is an upbeat replica of a lodge where people and dogs can enjoy good food.",

    "text": "***New to yelp so sorry if its a bit wordy***  We went to Lazy Dog for the first time yesterday and we were amazed. When we first arrived the hostess was pleasant and guided us to our booth. Immediately after seating, we were greeted by our waiter named Oscar. Oscar was very attentive to our needs, gave us a few suggestions after we had asked him for some and answered any questions we had about their plates. He even offered us healthier alternatives that were listed on the rear of the menu (probably since were were dressed in athletic gear).  As we were trying to decide what to try, the restaurant manager surprisingly brought us flat bread (pictured) to try for it being our first time at Lazy Dog. The Flat bread was great in taste which we decided to save a portion of to eat with our entree.   After deciding what to order, we went with the Sweet Potato Tater Tots and Bahama Chicken (both pictured). The Tater Tots were positively delicious and the Bahama Chicken was great. The Bahama Chicken is described as a Jerk Chicken which normally has a kick (spice) to it but this plate had a ever so slight kick.  Oscar also informed us of the Cajun Fries (pictured) that are free if you were to place a Yelp Review for the restaurant, which we completed. The Cajun Fries were delicious and were a relatively large portion.  We would definitely order these again.  Throughout our experience, the manager visited our table twice. Once to deliver the Flat Bread and second to inquire how everything was turning out. Oscar was also very attentive to our tables needs and didn't let our waters run dry (I must add that I drink tons of water).  Overall, we felt that our experience went very well for our first time at the Lazy Dog. There was not a wait at all (we arrived around 1pm) and upon us leaving, the restaurant was getting a good flow of guests. The work staff seemed to be very pleasant and happy to be there, especially the restaurant manager (whose name I forgot, sorry if you're reading this) and Oscar our waiter. The dishes were excellent in taste and reasonably affordable. Their menu had a great deal of selections although slightly wordy making the menu a little intimidating. Great ambience and good music to go with it.",

These items were not only favorites of mine but they were top sellers!!! Honestly, it was really STUPID to take these popular items off the menu. Instead of changing the menu every two goddamn months to please yourselves perhaps you should leave it alone and let your customers enjoy it. I will tell you this: if you or your corporate staff keep making stupid decisions with the menu, you will start losing loyal customers including me!!!!",

We had to leave early and go inside tonight because we simply couldn't enjoy ourselves on the patio in the cold :( I would come back when the fire pit is working...but I probably will go somewhere else until then.

My boyfriend and I sat on the patio with our maltipoo Poppy, he had the chicken and white rice. He's a picky dog, so I was surprised to see he ate all the rice with the chicken. We enjoyed their chicken pot pie, pulled pork burger, and tried the beer flight. I loved how the chicken pot pie was a traditional set up, and not just a bowl of soup with a piece of puff pastry on top. Downtown summerlin is a perfect location for this restaurant. I will be coming back with poppy for happy hour! Thanks Denise!!!!!!!!!",

His manager Jake called me so I could go over my experience at the lazy dog.  Jake called and was apologetic and said he would address both the issues with his employees and get them the proper training. He was very nice and empathetic with me.  I was very impressed that the owner actually had his manager contact me to go over what happened. That is extremely professional.  It's next to impossible to give perfect service every time in the restaurant business and I understand that.  I will definitely be back to day Hi to Jake",

There was a wait if you wanted to sit inside which is not unusual anywhere in Summerlin on a Saturday night.  I started off with a Greens, eggs and ham.  It was a very fun small dish. It had small broccoli pieces, bacon (no ham) and a poached egg.  It's great for sharing.  The rest of the family had different culinary items varying from Italian (Chicken Parm and Pizza) to Mexican (Carne Asada) to Caribbean   Chicken.  Everyone loved their food.    The Caribbean Chicken had a jerk sauce that while definitely not authentic was a nice hearty portion pared with thinly sliced cucumbers with a zesty sauce and rice.  It went well together.  They also serve Chinese food there also with a twist (I didn't try it).  If you are tired of eating the same old stuff, go to Lazy Dogs.  It's American Cuisine that's really good.  Oh yeah, people can bring their dogs to the restaurant outside.  All the dogs were well behaved.",

Cute, but not the dinner experience I was hoping for...don't get me wrong, we love kids. But you get it right?  At the host stand, we asked for the \"adult section\" She laughed, and knew EXACTLY what I was saying!! Brought us to a cozy high boy table, and we were happy!

Apparently they let dogs here....didn't see any but not sure if I would have enjoyed the place with a bunch of dogs around. I go out to get away from my dogs... Place looks like claim jumper with a little edge. I ordered the pot roast dip. Flavor was good but there is too much bread for so little meat.

We got the carnitas hash and strawberry French toast. The French toast was the perfect amount of sweetness and was very light. The carnitas hash = amazing!!! I ate every last bite. Poached eggs (perfectly poached), sweet potato tots (yum), peppers, onions, cheese, and not to mention the delicious pork! I will definitely be coming back here just for that. Service is great as well. My only con is that there are no misters on the patio, so eating outside during the summer is not a good idea.",

I give 3 stars because they still have a nice bar and selection of mixed drinks, and you can bring a dog if you like.

I say adult because the rest do not act like adults, they are apathetic, rude, and lazy. The hostesses are the worst, they role their eyes if you ask a question and have constant RBF.

I enjoyed my Turkey Burger and had requested it be blackened with blue cheese on it. It was delicious, cooked to perfection, and really tender.

    "text": "It's not always about the food.  First off, the food is average, no gourmet here. It's all about the fat and smell which  makes it taste good.Therefore it's good....uh hah...   the staff is friendly..... as they should be, tips depend on it. Next the noise, it's off the charts so there is no real possibility of carrying on a normal conservation without raising your voice. Everyone is trying to talk over the next to be heard. Add the music..... well ya get the point. We've been here about 6 times or so. About 8 of our friends have complained and also refuse to go back. We just wanted to see if it would settle down some. We stopped in 6/28/2015 for \"one and done'' just to get out of the heat 114. Sitting at the bar is usually quieter. A \"dude\" next to us had other ideas. His menu spread out beside his phones to point that it interfered with our service area,  2 phones, not one but 2.... ear buds to make his calls and talking very loud. Ya know the drill ya always talk louder with your ear buds in. To make it worse he aimed his conservation in our direction not towards the service bar next to him. We politely asked him to direct his conservation in the other direction and we were told to F off. Next we called for the MOD to intervene and he was told to basically f-off also. (he always used the F bomb) I instantly thought..... what would happen on an aircraft at 32,000'........ slowly open the door...... and The manager was totally unequipped to handle the situation. He stood next to us and he himself had to raise his voice to be heard over the \"dude\". .....but did nothing. Most people would take the conversation...... \"or would have been asked by management to take it outside or into the lobby\". That wasn't gonna happen. So we give it only 2 stars because the line staff is good at what they do but not paid to intervene.  The MOD on the other was in over his head and thought the use of a phone at the bar has now become \"acceptable etiquette\" and interfering with a patrons quiet space is now allowable...... wait till we catch him on an aircraft.......  A trip to a restaurant should never end this way.  And no , we will not return and will relay this to anyone who wants our opinion of Lazy Dog including our 8 friends in Summerlin.  Just as we left \"sexual preference\" also became an issue. Lucky for him we believe in the rule of law and not mob rule, in the old days......32,000 would be at ground level.",

Apparently they make all of their dishes from scratch which is impressive considering our food came out rather quick (mind you, we got sandwiches). The service was above and beyond excellent. The gentleman who served us was extremely kind and patient and he gave us amazing recommendations. I had the roasted chicken and Havarti sandwich which was phenomenal. My husband loved his pot roast sandwich. We'll be back!",

It is somewhat difficult to navigate through the narrow entryway in order to be seated or add your name to the wait list. The food was great both times! I have two teenage sons who can be hard to please, but we have always left full and happy with our food. The reason I gave 3 stars was the service. On both visits we've had less than attentive service. This second time my son ordered a strawberry citrus lemonade, still hadn't received it once our food came. We reminded the waitress who finally brought it more than halfway into dinner. I asked on 4 separate occasions for a water refill, not once did she come through with it. I finally gave up. I realize it's a Saturday night, and don't expect spot on service, but something a little more than what we've received would be nice! We do love that dogs are welcome outside and intend to give them another shot so we can bring the dog!",

    "text": "Normally a great restaurant. Today however we got a hostess by the name of Santana. She initially treated my wife rudely, raising her voice at my wife because she didn't understand our last name. We were with out of town guests and didn't want an issue. It was clear to Santana we weren't happy with her attitude.  We were then conveniently forgot about while waiting for a table. I complained about the wait, she said our table was being prepared and it would be about 2 minutes. Approximately 15 minutes later I told Santana I wanted to speak  with a manager. We were immediately seated. My son handed Santana the pager, she aggressively pulled the pager out of his hands. The manager, Eric,  was very good about our situation and we were comfortably reimbursed for the issues. Upon ordering our food, one of our of town visitors had ordered a half of a turkey sandwich. She removed the top of the sandwich and right there in the middle was a bug. She lost her appetite and the server took the sandwich to Eric. Eric returned to our table and apologized profusely, agreeing there was a bug in the sandwich. We were again properly reimbursed, Eric was great, managed his customers as he should. However the question remains if you piss Santana or another hostess or host off is your food compromised. Some make ask, \"Was this a coincidence\"? I personally don't believe in coincidences. Good job Eric, Santana has to go.",

They used barbecue sauce, and other spices. There was nine of us and all of our food was luke warm!  I  would have preferred to have my dinner served hot. We didn't have time to send it back. We had plans after dinner. The service was so slow, . I was afraid I would get sober before I get my next drink!  This is one of my go to places now.

The reason why I bring this up is because the reservation was made for the dining room inside and when I arrived one in our party brought their new puppy so we had to dine outside on the patio instead. As you can imagine, on this day the restaurant was packed but I made the request to sit on the patio instead,  not thinking it could be accommodated at a peak lunch time and on this day of all days. Well, big shout out to Elena who acknowledged my request with such professionalism and in such a naturally friendly manner that made me feel like I wasn't a bother at all and that it wasn't a big deal; it was believe me. We all enjoyed our meals and the service was good but strained a bit with the volume. At the end of our meals I found Elena and thanked her for her efforts. Again she had the same warm demeanor and smile. I hope management shares this review with her.",

    "text": "I normally would rate Lazy Dog 5-STAR, up until an incident today.  We frequent your establishment located in Downtown Summerlin, Las Vegas on a regular basis, dining at least four to five times a month with friends and family, and have always been pleased with the food and service.   We raved about your restaurant and your food to many of our neighbors and community associations.  However, I must relay to you an incident that occurred today, September 30, 2017.   It had us questioning whether or not we want to subject ourselves to the rude and obnoxious behavior we encountered today from one of your employee. The employee in question is the hostess, Brenda.  We always arrive early when your restaurant open in the morning on weekend, so we get a table in one of the far corners of restaurant. The reason being we have a large-senior-service dog and like to isolate him so no other patrons are bothered by his presence.  Today, being the first party to arrive, we politely requested to be seated in one of the far corner table.  We were rudely told by Brenda that those section were closed and we had to sit in the middle of the restaurant.  After seating us she snidely said, \"Do you have a leash for that dog!\"  Two minutes later another couple arrived, and the same Brenda who informed us that the corner section was closed to us, seated the couple at the table we had requested minutes earlier.   To make matters worse the table that Brenda assigned us, was in direct sunlight, with no shade, and since my wife is sensitive to sunlight she was extremely uncomfortable.  To top it off, Brenda processes to squeeze two parties of families with children, each on both sides of us, virtually boxing us in, and making our dog anxious and apprehensive.  Needless to say this was quite an unpleasant experience that resulted in our loss of appetite and a half-eaten meal.  My wife took our dog and walked out of the patio to go back to our vehicle.  It left her aggravated and with upset stomach.  She went to speak to the Supervisor/Manager, Christy.  My wife pointed out and informed the entire incident to Christy, and the extremely uncomfortable surroundings, as well as the rudeness and snotty attitude of the hostess named Brenda.    Once again, we are regular-satisfied patrons of Lazy Dog Restaurant, but this incident today is unusually disturbing, upsetting and extremely disappointing.  We hope to see that this incident does not happen again.  When a customer is politely and respectfully requesting a particular seat, the least for a \"representative\" or hostess of an establishment should do is respond back politely and respectfully, no matter the accommodation.",

It's kinda off on its own with plenty of parking and easy in, easy out street access.   Place was bumping at 5 pm with the happy hour crowd. We opted for a seat on the patio, with the dogs. WARNING: if you hate the sound of little dogs barking, opt for a seat inside. I love that they offer doggie meals and doggie seating, but I hate little yappy dogs, and there were plenty of them!  Our waitress was incredible. She gave us so much attentiveness, it honestly felt like we were her only table. She was so friendly and cordial...I just wish I could remember her name here!  Food was just OK. We ordered:  - White peach sangria Amazing! Can come in a pitcher.  - Togarashi Edamame Beans This was awesome. It comes in a tangy spicy sauce. So good!  - Hand-breaded Chicken Tenders These were gigantic, but nothing out of the ordinary.  - Cajun Fries Had a nice seasoning on them. Pretty good, but nothing outrageous. I would've liked them to have been crispier. They weren't soggy, but they weren't crispy. Dip for the fries is super yummy!  - Ahi tuna sliders Really could've been better. I couldn't even taste the ahi because it was heavily coated in some kind of avocado sauce.   - Brick Oven Spinach & Sundried Tomato Cheese Dip Meh. Didn't care for this. The spinach dip had a really tough and overly gooey consistency.   - Spicy Buffalo Chicken Nuggets Just OK. Again, nothing crazy.   To summarize: the service was incredible. The drinks were fantastic. And the food was just so so. For everything we ordered, our bill was only $74!!!!! Outrageous price for the value.",

She brought us samples of both, and she was right. You gotta try that huckleberry beer.  Lisa was the best, checking on us throughout our meal. Food was delicious and fast.",

All though was very empty took some time to get assistance. Ordered BBQ ribs,...watch out , these ribs are NOT BBQed  they are deep fried ! Eeek ! dry and flavorless. maybe delicious for lazy stray dogs !!! never seen deep fried ribs....disaster of a product !! We sent them back, and i never send food back ! just imagine ...... Furthermore, they came in a aluminum plate. I thought maybe they got their plates from PETCO or some PRISON ! I got it its called the LazyDog but come on now, we don't have to eat like dogs, as a matter of a fact even my maltese eats in china porcelain plate with daisies on it  The Restaurant theme is a FAILURE of a concept !!",

Me and my best friend snagged a seat at the bar and were accommodated by the bartender Adam. He was very intelligent, knowledgable, and very accommodating. My water was literally filled right as soon as it was empty. 5/5 service that's for sure.  For their drink prices, they are soooo reasonable and delicious. I tried their Moscow mule (yum), blueberry margarita, cucumber martini, and the sangria sampler. Everything was spot on and perfect. As for our food, it came out so fast and their portions were huge! We ordered off the happy hour menu their hush puppies, ahi, Cajun fries, and cheese quesadilla. Everything was cooked to perfection, I was literally so full and regretting everything I ate hahahah. Such amazing food and service! Will be back again for sure :)",

Ok maybe big party or something coming but he doesn't give us reason why couldn't sit there so who knows. Not even 5 minutes later the booths are now all sat with regular customers like myself.

    "text": "I had such a great overall experience with Lazy Dog restaurant!  The service and food were phenomenal.  Yes this restaurant is dog themed but it is done in a way that is surprisingly tasteful and not overdone.  You can also bring Fido along and dine out on the patio area if you do.  Luckily my party of two only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  Our server was friendly and attentive, she asked us if this was our first time dining there and we said it was.  Our drink and food orders were taken and brought out quite quickly.  The manager even stopped by at our table to introduce himself and bring us out a complimentary garlic flatbread since he heard it was our first time eating at Lazy Dog.  The food and drinks were all delicious, this place is definitely one of the better and more reasonably priced restaurants in Downtown Summerlin.  It looked like this place had a decent happy hour too so I'll have to come back and check it out.       We ordered: -Spicy Thai Chicken Salad ($9.95) - I had a pretty big lunch so I ordered this thinking it would be light, but the portion size was generous!  I had left overs of this salad, it was delicious and filling.  This menu item did have a flame next to it meaning it would be a bit on the spicy side.  I didn't find it too spicy but I think that's more of a personal preference type of thing.  -Chicken Pot Pie ($13.75) - My friend ordered this and I had some of the dish.  It was quite tasty one of the better chicken pot pies I've had.  The crust was nice and flaky and the inside had the right amount of chicken to veggie ratio inside too.    -Coconut Mojito ($8.75) - Super light and refreshing perfect if you want a cocktail but nothing too heavy that'll leave you feeling overly bloated.   -Southern Lemonade ($7.95) - This drink was delicious a bit on the sweet side, couldn't taste the alcohol in this drink at all (which I guess is a pro or con depending on what type of drinks you like).",

My husband and I got the queso and salads, he got the Tex-Mex, and I got the Thai chicken salad. My salad was fresh and perfectly dressed. My husbands was a bit bland but still good. The queso is incredible as well as the chips. We finished up with the butter cake which was just sweet enough, but super moist and tender and then fresh strawberries and ice cream. Again everything was fresh and so delicious. I'm so impressed. We will definitely be back and I'm going to try the ribs next time.",

They asked if it was our first visit and we let them know that it was. They walked us through the menu, specials, and drinks, and we decided to do a full meal experience.  Starting with complimentary cheese Flatbread and an order of wings, we were really happy. With an order of beer samplers,the wings were hot out of the fryer and crispy. We downed wings with 6 samples of beers and that made the start of our weekend a good one.  All 3 sauces the wings came with are delicious but we really didn't need it.  My husband ordered chicken, wok fried, teriyaki style, and I grabbed their classic cheeseburger. Both dishes were fresh and tasty. I loved every bite of both! Their teriyaki chicken is crispy and well balanced of sweet and salty. The burger was well seasoned and juicy. A great dinner.   To come full circle, we grabbed the butter cake. I will dream of that buttery goodness until our next visit. We ordered the balsamic reduction on the side to keep the cake pristine in flavor and we're so glad we did. I'd order it again as my only meal. Sweet, creamy with crunchy edges...it was addictive.   Great service and food equals a regular stop for dinner.  I cannot wait to eat there again.",

From Brunch to dinner, and happy hour to lunch I love Lazy dog. Thanks for today's hospitality to our server Erica, and Brooke the manager.

    "text": "Never been to a dog friendly restaurant before so this is somewhat of a new experience for me.   When we first arrived there were 3 people ahead of us, so it took about maybe a 15 min wait to be seated which wasn't that bad considering it was a Sunday afternoon. Once seated we were placed all the way in the back behind a pillar which is fine I guess, but considering that there were a couple chairs in front I don't know why we were seated so far. Ok, fine whatever. Once seated, no one came to greet us, it took literally 30 mins for our server to come greet us then take our order. Even with that, we've been sitting there without any utensils and no water for quite a while. I was ok to wait since we had my dog with us and well it was an outing occasion for him since it was his birthday.   Once we got our food, we had already been there for an hour. The food was mediocre, the only thing that had taste was the Cajun fries even then it was tiresome to eat cause the flavors out did itself. I got the Tex-Mex salad which had a recommendation paw next to it, I thought it was ok. Nothing special to it, and my bf got the lunch special wok chicken which he said was all right. The rice was undercooked, and the flavor was just not there.  I ordered a hamburger patty and brown rice for the little one, and he agreed the rice was undercooked cause even he didn't eat it all, and this boy loves rice lol.  Overall the doggie sitting outside experience was ok, my little one enjoyed being near us. But the food and service was terrible, I'm sad to say I would not be going back again. Which is sad cause this was the only dog outdoor dining experience we've had.",

    "text": "After just one visit, I love this place.  We'd been hearing the buzz about Lazy Dog's for a while and as usual, seemed to resist the urge to just fly over there.  Then finally, the schedule was open and we dove in.  Wow!  It was an expectedly busy evening and we didn't make reservations, but the wait wasn't bad.  They told us ~40 minutes and that's what it was.  With two adults and a child in our party, we figured we'd get to test the service, a good assortment of the food and get a little feedback from our son in addition to what we thought about it.  When you walk in, the place is decorated with a kind of western, domestic pet, industrial flair.  Go and see.  Somehow it works.  There are two cool industrial sculptures when you enter:  a horse's head and a dog.  Very cool.  We opted for first available seating which landed us on the patio, and a great time was underway.  Right up front, the place is dog friendly, as you might or might not suspect from the name.  Yes, you can bring your four-legged buddy.  The menu has a great selection for the humans, and several nice choices for your critter companion as well.  The pup will also get a bowl of water.  We weren't sure if there would be the calm we saw in Germany when we lived there (and it was common to see dogs at restaurants), or pet pandemonium.  Without exception, all the critters in attendance were well-behaved and under their owner's control.  Nice.  Since we sat on the patio, we had several dogs around us.  After ordering and waiting for our food, my son politely asked if he could pet a couple of pups near us and with the owner's permission, he had some new friends to keep him occupied while we chatted with the owners and waited for our food.  The menu is not too big but full of a real diversity of items, with something for just about anyone.  They also had a kid's menu for our little guy.    Here's what we ate:  we ordered the Wok Fired Calamari and the Hatch Chili & Bacon Mac n' Cheese (off the small plate menu) for appetizers.  The calamari was made from nice sized strips (rather than the traditional small rings) served over rice and cooked with mild green and red peppers.  The Mac n' Cheese was some of the best I've had, with the chili's giving it just the slightest bite.  Perfect balance with the bacon and cheese, none of which overwhelmed the pasta.  For our main courses, my wife had the Pot Roast Beef Dip and I ordered the Chicken Poblano.  Both were fantastic.  The pot roast variation on the traditional French Dip resulted in my wife declaring this may be her favorite French Dip sandwich in the Valley.  The Chicken Poblano was perfect, with the sauce just perfectly the right spice and heaviness that it complemented and didn't overwhelm the chicken.  We were stuffed and while we were relaxing before paying our bill, we saw the Lamb Shank and Campfire Pot Roast delivered to a nearby table, somehow making use hungry again. They both looked and smelled fantastic.  I'm definitely going to try the Lamb next time we're there.  As the weather cools, don't forget there's a large fire pit in the middle of the outdoor seating.  Obviously surrounded by the tables on the patio, it's also designed to allow guests to use the side of the pit as their table, so if you're wanting a seat up close and near the warming flames, be sure to ask.  Located on the north end of Downtown Summerlin, there's ample parking all around the restaurant.  If you really crave keeping your car in the shade, it's not far to the nearest parking garage.  Very convenient!  Definitely give Lazy Dog's a try.",

But the food was the only reason for a decent rating.  We walked over here after being incredibly let down by the \"Farmer's Market\" across the street, and much to our surprise we were seated immediately.   The hostess was very friendly and personable! She talked to us about our day, about some menu items and was all in all great! I wish she had been out waitress! After we were seated our waitress who was nice, but not memorable came and took our orders:  Drinks:  Bloody Mary Jamaican Lemonade  Appetizers:  Garlic Flatbread    Lunch:  Baja Burger W/Cajun Fries Warm Chicken Focaccia   Drinks were 5/5 I would definitely recommend the Jamaican Lemonade!  Appetizer: 5/5 but we substituted Ranch instead of the marinara.  Lunch: 3/5 The Burger was great but huge and messy and the Chicken Focaccia had a bunch of hard dried up pieces of chicken in it like it had been sitting under the heat lamp too long, which would make sense given the fact that we had to wait almost forty minutes for our food to come out.  I love Lazy Dog as a brand but I wouldn't recommend this location.",

    "text": "So I originally wanted to give this place two stars but I will explain why it barely made the third star. First off I've only been here a couple times and within those times left a good enough mark on me to not want to go back or let it be my last option. So first time I went there was with my girlfriend and our dog. It took forever to get a glass of water and it took forever to order after the water. BUT WAIT.. No literally wait, because after the order was more waiting. I got so fed up that I was becoming uninterested with my food but it came. I tried their chipotle chicken quesadilla which I think is really overpriced which I can get better ones at Denny's for cheaper. And I got a side of French fries which I never got because they forgot and I wasn't about to wait longer because getting the check felt a lifetime. At least they didn't charge me for it. Second time I came with another couple plus my girlfriend and out dog again. Everyone got chicken Alfredo and one side of fries and I got the black and bleu pizza and Cajun fries. Yes I got my fries this time but the one guy who got the one side of regular fries didn't because they forgot. Saw that one coming. We got our table at 8. We wanted to eat and go get ice cream after but after all the waiting we didn't finish until 11. Trust me it was the same situation as my first visit. It was almost parallel to each other. BUT the reason and the only reason it barely made the third star is because their black and bleu pizza is absolutely amazing. I took it home and ate the leftovers the next day and it still tasted amazing. I don't know though if I would want to wait that long for a pizza. I guess it's nice also that I can bring my dog, but I'm better off ordering Dominos or Pizza Hut and relaxing with my girlfriend and dog at home.",

He was extremely nice and helpful and when one of our orders didn't come out he made sure to take care of it and gave us 2 on the house desserts . He had a great attitude and helped us all out for us to be satisfied . I had the ribs it was a little dry but still good but their corn salad that comes with it was amazing . Also their tortilla soup was very tasty also . Overall I liked the place it was very well designed and had a good stock in the bar .",

    "text": "My first and most likely only experience at this place is only a 3 star because of the manager saving the day. I will break it down here:  Arrived and it was pretty busy, noticed small table in the bar area and was told we could take it, PERFECT, no wait. Our waiter was on us right away, drinks ordered quickly and then it all fell apart. We weren't ready to order, so we asked for a couple more minutes. After about 15 minutes I finally asked my wife if she had seen our waiter, he was completely gone. I don't know if he had a smoke break or was helping in the main dining area but we was gone. We asked another employee if we could order and he said yes and disappeared, I assume to find our waiter.  Twenty minutes, we finally order, and a water re-fill. Then it's another waiting game, food took another 25-30 minutes and no check in from the waiter. We track down our waiter to inquire about our food and he says he will check. He shows up a couple minutes later, \"Just Finished\" he says, we begin to eat our food. COLD! At this point I had had it, I didn't care, we had been there for over an hour I knew we wouldn't see our waiter again, empty water glass, so we ate.  30 Minutes for two cold sandwiches. Grilled Cheese and Pot Roast Dip. Grilled Cheese was nothing special, my wife said it was okay. The Pot Roast Dip had very little meat and the onions were super sweet. The bread was good but overpowered all the other flavors, except the sweet onions. I told the waiter it was cold when he finally did come to see us, his reply \"I wish you would have told me I could have done something about that.\" How can I tell you when we only see you every 25 minutes?  This was a one star experience but it turns out the waiter did let his manager know the food was cold, so I guess he did do something. I'm sure he didn't mention that my food sat in the window and this is the only reason why the french fries were cold and the sandwich lukewarm at best. The manager did apologize covered the cost of my sandwich and comped a free desert. I appreciate the manager quickly coming to us and apologizing more than the comped food, but I appreciate that gesture as well.   Overall poor experience: Poor food, poor service, but nice manager. I liked the waiter when he was with us, I just wish he checked in on us more.",

As the owner has asked for specifics here goes:  The chicken poblano was not spicy it was peppery.  Yes pepper is a spice but not the only one available to enhance food.  It was inedible and I sent it back.  I then had to wait over 20 minutes for a cold sandwich I ordered in its place.  Too long. My husbands pot pie had no taste at all and the sauce was gummy.  The brick spinach appetizer was odd and over salted.  There really needs to be improvement with the spices here.  I think you are trying for too much variety you might want to specialize in one cuisine.  But you definitely need to figure out the proper uses of salt, pepper and spices.",

This place is slightly more upscale, and the dogs are super encouraged as well as fed there if you want to order for them and a part of the whole gimmick of course.

While the beer selection is not expansive, it is quite good for a chain restaurant.  One of the coolest things is their dog friendly patio.  Despite hopping with customers on a Friday night at 8pm, they had us seated in under 20 minutes.  After reading many yelps regarding the Chicken Pot Pie, Dave decided to give it a try.  It was good, but the best thing we tasted was the seasonal mushroom barley soup with giant chunks of mushroom.  Normally the barley overwhelms a soup, but this was just right.  I ordered the ribs.  The meat was nicely cooked, but the sauce was too sweet and the mashed potatoes and succotash were lifeless.  I asked for some butter and to my surprise they brought me some garlic butter, which helped give some life to the potatoes.",

I personally recommend the Cajun Fries and a tall glass of Hoppy Time to go along with them.  Our group had about 10 people during happy hour and the place was mostly packed in the bar area but didn't feel constrained.  All the staff was extremely nice and we had a great time trying out new brews. I highly recommend this place whenever you need a drink, a bite and a great atmosphere.",

I've had a number of different servers throughout my many visits here and all have been so pleasant. On my last visit I was waiting at the front for a few of my colleagues who were going to join me. While I waited (which was probably about 20 mins) the host Sue was kind enough to ask me if I wanted something to drink until they got there. Though I see her pretty often, I have never had a chance to talk with her for more than just a few minutes. She is sweet,  informative and funny as hell.",

    "text": "UPDATE 06/14/18  I'm changing my review to 5 stars because this restaurant is the only place I go now with my dog. I've probably had everything on their menu by now and the quality of food and drinks is awesome. Service is great too! I can take my dog to any restaurant with a patio in Downtown Summerlin but we just keep coming back to this place all the time! The vibe is awesome and my beagle likes socializing with other pups. It's very easy to drop $100 on dinner for 2 people here but it's totally worth it!   UPDATE 8/10/17  Food quality and selection has improved amazingly since my last review. Everything tastes delish and I especially like ahi tuna with coconut curry cauliflower puree. We keep coming back to this joint all the time because of the dog friendly patio and chill vibe. However, Lazy Dogs service is still major HIT or MISS and one time it was so bad that the manager ended up comping our drinks. I'm not sure why they can't hire more people to fix this issue.   --- I've been here 3 times and it's always HIT or MISS. The only reason why I keep coming back is location and dog friendly patio (btw, a lot of restaurants with patios allow dogs, so the concept isn't new).   The food is definitely just OK. We ordered roasted brussel sprouts and they were burnt, swimming in oil and lemon dressing. I can do better at home. Same thing happened with my chopped salad - lemon dressing was overpowering and my dog's chicken tasted better than the one in my salad. I sent my dish back and got tacos which were not bad.   Drinks are great. I ordered Blueberry martini made with natural ingredients and it was phenomenal.   Dog menu is just chicken and rice and portions are huge, suitable for a great dane and not a beagle (which is my dog).   Last but not least, service. Well... that's another hit & miss here. Sometimes it's slow and they forget your order and sometimes it's pretty good.  Bottom line - next time we are going to try another place and just take food to go and eat it by the \"rock\" fountain.",

    "text": "Went to the newly opened Lazy Dog in Downtown Summerlin after trying their location several times in San Diego which we always enjoyed.  The location is great and the restaurant was clean and decorated well. You can tell all the servers were properly trained because they were extremely friendly and knew the extensive menu very well. They had a great happy hour menu and have both an early and late night happy hour which is great.  I ordered the cucumber mint martini which was fantastic and on the happy hour menu. We also tried the inside out quesadilla which was phenomenal, with crispy cheese on the outside of the quesadilla, a concept I want to go home to try! It was also on the HH menu, so for only $4 or $5 bucks, everyone should order it at least once!  I ordered a personal black and bleu pizza from the happy hour menu and a side salad since the  pizza is only 6 inches. The pizza was great with the strong taste from the bleu cheese and a generous portion of bacon. My side salad was amazing as it could be. Most restaurants use cheap lettuce and ingrediants, but this one was very tastey,  My husband ordered thai noodles which was a generous portion of pad thai with chicken. My husband found a small eggshell in the dish, which showed they use fresh ingrediants and the manager came by immediately to handle the situation and gave us his meal for free.   We also ordered the key lime cheesecake which was perfect to share and delicious at only $5. Overall, food was great, service was excellent (I highly recommend Kara/Cara), drinks came out quickly, and the restaurant was clean and ambiance great. This will def be our happy hour go to in the area!",

    "text": "First time dining here for me. Birthday dinner for a good friend. Six of us total. Great experience overall minus a very odd encounter with a management type after we were seated and before we saw our waiter. First the good then the odd. Arrived without a reservation. Waited close to an hour for a table - but that's all good - It's a Saturday night on the Island of Las Vegas. Not a bad wait outside the patio area watching people and their dogs. When we were finally seated (this is where the encounter with the management person happened - but more on that later).  When our waiter finally made an appearance after a bit of a wait he was excellent. Terrific all through the dinner. His name was/is BJ and I was very impressed by his demeanor and service. After going over a few items (my first time - I never know what to order) he suggested the Bison meatloaf. Great suggestions. Excellent. Not as good as my wife's but for restaurant meatloaf it was close to that level. Came with very good mashed potatoes. My wife had a roasted chicken sandwich which she gave a big thumbs up to. My daughter is vegan and she had some kind of a veggie burger as did another in our party. Both said it was terrific. Mother-in-law had the Tex-Mex salad and she was happy - and as long as my wife AND my mother-in-law are happy - I'm happy. Finally, the birthday girl had a grilled cheese. Grilled cheese? I can't figure that out - but she liked it.   I ordered the banana pudding for desert - something you don't see often on menus. Very good. Our wonderful waiter, BJ, brought over a big slice of their butter cake with ice cream on it and some other stuff. Superb. And of course; he had a candle on it. Right after taking our desert order, BJ did something that really impressed me. He saw that I had my credit card off to the side, kind of hiding it. My plan was to pay for dinner before the birthday girl's husband could reach for the check, which he ALWAYS does. I asked BJ where the restroom was - hoping to see him off to the side when I returned so I could tell him about the birthday girl and give him my credit card before he brought the check. He was very attentive and very sharp - he replied, \"I'll show you where it's at, sir...the directions are little tricky.\" Well - he had actually intuited that I wanted to pay the bill and got me away from the table very discreetly. \"I thought that was your intention!\" he said. That was impressive.   Now the odd part. After were first seated in a booth we were all very thirsty after waiting in the sun for almost an hour. Now, under these circumstances, five minutes can seem like an hour. But at least 10 minutes passed and no one came by our booth to inquire if we wanted water or drinks or anything at all. It was a bit too long for such a quick and simple check-in. Finally, the hostess walked by and I got her attention. \"Excuse me, could we please get some water.\" She seemed like she was caught off guard and just mumbled \"Sure\".  A moment later another lady, who I found out later was named Carrie - and was a management type - came over and abruptly said \"I understand there is a problem?\" The way she said it and the timing was very uncomfortable. I'm thinking 'what the heck?'. I was about to say \"What do you mean, 'problem'?\" when, just then, a busboy came up with a tray of waters. Carrie realized that I was saying we just wanted water and she kind of laughed and said \"Ask and you shall receive.\" I wasn't exactly laughing. It was odd. What did the hostess say to her? \"Hey Table XXXXX has a problem, can you speak with them\"???? You would think she would just let someone know there were some thirsty customers patiently waiting. Thank goodness for BJ.",

    "text": "Five Stars for service, Zero stars for food!  This review is based only on my experience at the bar for Happy Hour only.  It's not possible to convey how we feel about this establishment with a Star Rating, because the review must be broken down into several, yet extremely opposite parts.  We went to Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar for the first time yesterday.  The atmosphere and restaurant is very pleasant.  The staff, bartenders and manager provide five star services.  I have to say that they are great and the management should be proud of every one of them. However we were very disappointed with the happy hour food.   We had three selections; Wings, Calamari, and Nachos. My opinion is that this restaurant completely dropped the ball here. The chef tried, but terribly failed with the preparation, taste and presentation of the Calamari.  It tasted like they opened a bag of frozen calamari, fried it, threw some Asian sauce on it and presented it over rice.  Wow!  This was not good at all.     I ordered the chicken nachos; unfortunately I was violently ill for 12 hours immediately after consuming this dish.   I feel badly that I have to write about this but I think it's in the best interest of my fellow readers.  Hopefully the Lazy Dog will be more careful with what they serve.   I wanted this place to be a home run and it was just the opposite.   Fantastic service cannot overcome terrible food.  I hope they will improve and consider reviewing the menu and putting in place a better system to monitor safety and quality in their kitchen.",

    "text": "Ughhhhhh I am SO on the fence about this place. It has just a shaky combo of both pros and cons. Honestly if they did not have the dog friendly patio I would never come back here, but the ambiance of the patio and the fact that you CAN enjoy a drink with your pup is enough to bring me back. I have been here 4 times and every single time it seems to be the same story... Pros: 1.Service has always been great especially the waiters and waitresses. My friend had a complaint about her food and the manager came by and it was handled with nothing but professionalism and her meal was comped which was very nice. 2.Drinks are ALWAYS on point. They have some great bartenders here.  3.Great atmosphere and kept really clean seeing as to how there are dogs everywhere!   Cons :( 1.the food is SOOOOO mediocre! I have never been wowed by ANYTHING here. It's very much a Applebee's, Chili's type quality. I've had the strawberry french toast, the chicken pot pie, the spinach artichoke dip, the veggie lasagna and the fish and chips and every single dish was just really lacking in taste, quality and freshness.  2. As awesome as the doggie meals are, I worry how fresh the chicken and meat in them are as even though my dogs have never gotten sick from them, my friends dog within hours became severly ill with vomiting and diarrhea. Makes me worry that maybe the meats they use in the doggie meals are very low quality. We called them after to let them know and they were very apologetic.  So again, great spot to chill with your pup and get a drink but don't expect some out of this world meal. I think with maybe just a bit more effort and quality with the ingredients in the food it would be SO much better.",

The waitresses were very nice but came across as incredibly too busy to be in any way attentive. On this second occasion, we ordered a little before noon and did not receive our food until at least 12:50.   The food is blah, of the Applebee's/Chili's/Friday's variety. I don't mind a wait for really good food, but nearly an hour for mediocre \"casual American\"? No thanks.   I don't see any reason to return here, especially considering I can get comparable food at comparable prices with better service from a number of nearby restaurants and not have to worry about taking an extended lunch.",

We were at a booth right behind a p.o.s. Which at any given time had 2 to 6 workers around it. After we received our food we were checked up on once with a water refill at that time. Then we finished our meal eventually. For a minimum of about 20 minutes we sat there with finished plates waiting.... And waiting .... And waiting. As at any given time with no lapse there was 2 to 6 workers standing 2 feet away. I eventually spoke up to one of the servers for checks. Which he basically said ok and told another server not even coming over to our table. Our waiter spent most of this 20 minutes at another table about 8 feet away from us having a convo with a couple. She came over once this happened. We asked for checks and boxes. She brought checks. Which we immediately had cash and card ready. Yet we waited another 5 to 7 minutes while there is still minimum 4 servers standing 2 feet away. Our checks obviously ready and standing. She came back took our checks. Cashed out and returned with all but 1 check which was 3 dollar change but she assumed it was tip. AND no box. We waited another 5 minutes or so before announcing to the group of about 3/4 servers we need a box. Finally got our box and was able to leave. The restaurant was less than half full, over staffed and yet had no attention from any server.  There is a reason it is called lazy dogs Lazy workers.   For the most part it's pretty much a yard house. Save your self the trouble and go to yard house. At least until they train their workers properly and have management team that keeps their workers busy.",

The bar area is perfect for watching games and the patio is perfect for open air dining...but be warned - MUST LOVE DOGS - because there can be a lot of them in all shapes and sizes. We haven't seen any dogs misbehave or worse (insert emoji - you know which one I mean)...it's been a really pleasant experience.  Recommendations: hummus platter, calamari, vegetarian lasagna (incredible!), fries with the lemon aioli sauce, veggie burger, fish tacos and ahi. We don't eat meat so it's great to have so many options on the menu.  So many things left to try! We'll keep going back.",

No greeting. Right when we walked in, all we saw were the young staff huddled together talking. It wasn't til moments later when one of the hostesses finally noticed us, and seated us at a table. By that point we were already annoyed. The host staff should be setting the tone on a good dining experience.  Other than that, our server was delightful and the food lived up to our expectations.

While our waitress was cheerful and helpful I'm not sure if she was to blame or others.   We ordered drinks shortly after we were seated.  Five minutes later our waitress returned with the soft drinks stating that we would be served shortly. While there she took our food order in which we ordered appetizers and entrees.  Fifteen minutes after that we were descended on by three wait staff with all of our entrees.   We immediately complained that we had not yet received our appetizers at which our appetizers arrived. We protested again then one of the wait staff remarked \"so you want us to throw away all of this food?\"    Fortunately a manager passed at this time seeing our confusion and frustration.  And assured us they would re-fire our entrees. We pointed out that we had still not received our drinks. He went to the bar to retrieve our drink order while we began to enjoy our appetizers. Shortly after that we received our initial drink order followed closely behind by a duplicate order served by the manager.  He then took away the duplicate order again apologizing.   We finally were able to enjoy the appetizers with our drinks. Once finished the fresh entrees did arrive.   When the check arrived we did verify that we were not charged twice for anything.  We were somewhat surprised though that we were not offered anything for this gaff other than apologies.   Not sure we'll return.",

I went with a group of people so we had a chance to try quite a bit of things on the menu and everything was okay but not great. The one thing that was really good was the butter cake. Patio is nice and spacious. The service was very slow and they could have been better trained but I'll give them a pass on this one since I went within the first month of opening, which is always rough.   I love that they offer grilled chicken and brown rice for pups and they bring bowls of water in disposable containers for them. All in all I think I would only come here if I was planning on bringing the dogs.",

This is not a trait to take lately people. Flavor is everything. So many restaurants out an emphasis on entrees and forget appetizers. Not here!  These guys make sure all their tummies, are yummy.   Drinks are generous and they don't skimp on the spirits which is important in this \"increase those margin\" society we live in. Their microbrews are super awesome and I especially dig their IPA. If you are into the IPA's then make your way over to this one cause it's good. I've had people who aren't fans of IPA's tell me how much they like it. Fortunately I'm already a fan and this one moved to my top tier.   Now let's close with service. Lazy Dog staff are friendly and accommodating. I think they either have a 4-year college degree requirement or they just plain hire intelligent folks. I'm no snob (well maybe a little), but I like a server who understands the world around them. I see this here and it's been consistent.   So why 4 stars and not 5?  Too new. I need to see this be consistent into the next year.  But I'm pretty certain they'll get it from me. They have the right ingredients to make it happen (pun intended). I'll just keep going there and I know they won't let me down.",

All dishes ordered have been delicious....except the spiral spaghetti/pasta. Didn't love that dish so much but it is listed as a house favorite so maybe it just wasn't my thing. I've actually ordered off of the kids menu as well, the chicken teriyaki/rice dish and the kids sundae which were both pretty tasty and more than enough food for a child or adult female.

    "text": "Not impressed. (Be careful if you can't have gluten)  The service was---weird. Staff was really friendly and welcoming. BUT it was just odd that we constantly had people coming by and checking on us. I'm all for attentive service but we could barely have a conversation because someone was coming by every few minutes to see how we were. The hostess seated us and then we had two different waiters taking orders, and two other staff coming by just to check on us. It went from \"this is really nice\" to \"leave us alone already\".  We also had several staff walk by the table and simply stare. We were seated right near the kitchen which would account for all the traffic, I guess. But the staring was very unsettling. It was just odd.   Food--everyone enjoyed their food. No one raved about it. Everyone in our party of five agreed there were better places to eat. But the food wasn't terrible or anything.   However--I have a complaint with their gluten free menu. I do not have Celiac's but I do have autoimmune thyroid disease and have a gluten sensitivity that can severely exacerbate symptoms. So, I'm as careful as can be. I was really happy they had a menu catering to those who are gluten free.   I ordered the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and the Japanese cucumber salad. All of these are listed on the GF menu. So, the waiter comes back to the table to inform me that they cannot serve me the cucumber salad because it comes with sesame seeds so it is not gluten free. ????  Sesame seeds are not gluten. They should pose no problem. And if they do, why is the salad even listed on the GF menu and what is hard about leaving the sesame seeds off the salad?  But I make a point not to argue with the people making my food so I just opted for the fruit instead. Imagine my confusion when they bring out my salmon and it is covered in sesame seeds. It was also covered in some kind of asian ginger sauce. Most asian sauces do have gluten. The GF menu did not mention any kind of sauce in the description. I waited until the waiter came back over to check on us and asked him if he was sure this was a gluten free item because of the sauce. He assured me that the salmon was gluten free.   I ate it but shouldn't have. Later that night I was severely ill and have had the usual symptoms I get when getting \"glutened\".  Yes, this is partially on me because I should have trusted my instincts; especially when they refused to bring me a salad with sesame seeds because they are supposedly gluten but then bring me a salmon covered in sesame seeds and tell me it is GF.  I do think if they are going to offer gluten free items though, they need to better train their staff. I'm pretty sure they were not supposed to include the ginger sauce on the salmon--a soy sauce that most likely contains wheat.   The third star is because I seriously enjoyed the cucumber thyme lemonade.",

Unfortunately that's when I get the worst service. I've been here multiple times with and without my dog. When I'm without my dog I'm sitting inside and service is efficient, prompt, and friendly. When I bring Helen and I'm out on the patio the service is not good at all. Wait times on food and drinks were way too long and I had to flag our waitress down more than twice. Also I don't know how seriously management takes this but none of us got carded when we ordered alcohol. We're all over 21 but we definitely don't look like it. Considering they're a new location I may consider giving them a shot in the future but service when you're out on the patio needs serious work",

Waited almost 40 min before i walked inside to see where our appertizer was and our waitress sounded surprised it wasn't out yet. Sat back down and our lunch arrived but with no pet meal (40 min later and no appetizer before) Appetizer came after the food and i had to go inside a second time to ask where our pet meal was..at this point we were feeding our dog food from our plate! 1 hour and 5 minutes later our pet meal came. I told the waitress we won't be paying for our appetizer or the pet meal we ordered and she said that was fine. It wasn't very busy either.  I've been there a handful of times and i've noticed 2 things also... They are in NO rush to buss the dirty tables whatsoever. Literally a table has sat dirty our entire time there.. Nothing like eating next to a dirty table. Secondly the food is very so so but they honestly have the most tasteless, bland chicken fingers i have ever had in my life, ever! I would go and just have drinks on the patio with our dog next time if anything.",

Things have kind of changed though since the new employee wardrobe was implemented or maybe that's just a coincidence. I don't know who thought making their employee dress code feature denim aprons and flannel shirts was a good idea and not a '90's retro night. My goodness I felt like I was in just another Texas Roadhouse/Lone Star Grille. Cool thing about this place was that it had a new CA TX feel and now it's turning into just another TGIFridays. Too bad, sincerely hope the management reconsiders.",

    "text": "Tried this place last night and it was the most PERFECT dining experience I have honestly ever had in my entire life.  They were packed (It was a Saturday night, so it was to be expected), but we only had to wait 5 minutes. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing, very warm and inviting, classy but very casual. I felt like I never wanted to leave!   5 stars for customer service alone! My bf ordered the Sriracha Chicken Sandwich, which I thought was a little out of his picky eater comfort zone, and naturally he wasn't a fan. He said it was \"not hot enough, not spicy enough, needs more cheese and less cucumber.\" So I kindly asked our waitress if she could box that up and bring us the menu so he could order something else. I had every intention of paying for it, but she said she would just take it off the bill. I thought that was A++ customer service. THAT is what builds patronage.   I had the Sundried tomato pesto pasta, and it was awesome.   But what I really came here to write the review about. THE PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE  (If only words could echoe)  Was. The best thing. I have. Ever eaten. In my life.   With whip cream, candied walnuts, chocolate and caramel syrup. This is legitimately what happened:  We both took a bite at the same time. Chewed. Eyes lit up. Swallowed. Looked at each other and we both said \"wow.\" in synchrony. Continued to take more bites and saying wow after till it was all gone.  Only con is that it is seasonal! So please, if you value your life at all, go to Lazy dog before winter is over, get whatever you want, but order THE PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE.",

When we showed up to the restaurant the management team worked very hard to correct the issue. What's best is you can tell they were sincere about making us happy. We went back last night for the first time since the incident and it was great. We had the pot roast which was delicious and the sangria was pretty tasty as well. Management is always visible throughout the floor which I admire quite a bit. I think this place is going to continue to thrive if they continue on the road they are on!",

I come with a particular group of friends because it's just convenient for all of us to get together there, but no one really seems all that crazy about it, to be honest. It has never been really busy any time I've visited, and there's plenty of seating inside. I think you can even eat with your dog on their outdoor patio, which is a nice perk. They offer a lot of food for special diets, and I usually get a burger sans bun because it's gluten free, but it doesn't really taste any different than something from a chain like Red Robin.   I found myself at their other location in Town Square recently, and their food seemed way better. My party there REALLY enjoyed their food. It seems strange that two parts of the same chain would have such a dramatically different flavor, but I guess it all comes down to the talent of the kitchen staff. I've never had an awful experience here, but I would prefer Town Square.",

She even remembered me(hopefully that is a good thing).  Either way, she remembered my food allergies and was very accommodating.

We have been for brunch, lunch, and happy hour and sat both outside with our dog and inside without him. Brunch is one of the best I've been to in town (and we go all over town trying different brunches) because for mimosas you can get a bottle with 3 different juices to make your own. The huckleberry pancake was also super delicious and big enough to split. We have been meaning to go back to try some more breakfast items. The menu is elcelctic and has something for everyone but  for lunch and happy hour some of the dishes we liked were the Cobb and asian salad, fish & chips, ahi poke, and sweet potato tots. I honestly usually get a salad or an appetizer so I can save room for dessert here cause it is so good. The s'mores, gluten sensitive lemon cake (think flourless chocolate cake but instead of chocolate lemon), and hand pie are the ones I've tried and they are all delicious. They even have a menu for your dog so they won't be drooling over your food the whole time!",

    "text": "Lazy dog is one of my favorite place, atleast when I want to go somewhere with my dog. It is the only place I know which openly allows dogs. The plus side is they allow dogs, the down side is you have to be outside, which is fair. My only complaint is sometimes it can get cold in the winter months when eating outside. They even have dog dishes consisting of hamburger or chicken with white or brown rice. And they bring out a bowl of water for the dog as well which is nice. Ok, enough about the dog food.  The food there is great, and there is a widddde variety to choose from. Whatever you're in the mood for, from pizza to thai noodles to chicken sandwiches to cheeseburgers, they got it. I personally love the bleu cheeseburger. I also tried the thai noodles with chicken which was good too. Considering it isn't an authentic thai place they did a nice job making it and the portion was huge.  The location is perfect at the Summerlin mall area. After I'm done eating at the lazy dog it is nice to walk over to other stores and sometimes the farmers market is out.            I really don't have any complaints about lazy dog. If you want to go to a restaurant and bring your pet, this place lets you. Not to mention they have several tvs so you can watch the sports or whatever big game is on. Typically I eat at buffalo wild wings or twin peaks but if there is a game on and I want to bring my pet then Lazy Dog is the place to be. I highly reccomend this place.",

    "text": "The Mister had a hankering to give Lazy Dog a try, so off we went! We came in on a Sunday night around 8PM and were sat at a table immediately. Surprisingly enough, Lazy Dog closes at midnight on a Sunday. Crazy, I know!   BAJA CALIFORNIA BURGER ($10.95): Any burger patty can be substituted with a vegetarian Gardenburger! The burger was huge and messy. So messy in fact, that I had to get all European and eat my burger with a fork and knife. Keeping it classy. Taste wise, the burger was just alright. I wouldn't order a burger again. Thankfully, there's sooo many other veg options to choose from at Lazy Dog! There's a tofu wok dish, Thai noodles with tofu, grilled cheese, and lavash tacos to name a few choices. The vegetarian friendly menu is one of the reasons I bumped my rating up to 4 stars. 3/5    HAWAIIAN STICKY RIBS ($15.95): Husband really liked the ribs, thought the Asian slaw was meh, and ate every single unami fry on the plate. 4/5  WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIP BROWNIE ($5.95): Presentation was kind of weird (fudge smear looked like a poop smear lol) and it tasted like the boxed brownies I make at home. 2.5/5    SERVICE: Our waiter was on his a-game. He got us refills without having to ask and was so damn proper! 5/5  VIBE: Pretty crowded and kinda loud. I was confused on the theme. There were paw prints on the table and Americana decor and license plates on the wall. Is it Western? The vibe reminded me of Claim Jumper, but not as hunter-ish. 3/5   PRO TIP: 10% discount for military! Wooooo  Worth a Return Visit? The Happy Hour deals seem great, so I'll definitely be back for that! Late Night HH is 9-close Sunday through Thursday at the bar and patio. $3 drafts and plenty of cheap apps too  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #128",

    "text": "I want to start off by saying that the beginning of my visit tonight had me down in the dumps so to speak. My mother had made a reservation earlier in the day to celebrate my birthday. The reservation was for a pretty big party, 11 of us. I arrived with my wife and son and informed the host that our reservation was for 6pm. He couldnt locate our party reservation in the computer. He then asked if maybe we had accidently made the reservation for the Lazy Dog's location in Town Square. Sure enough I called that location and our reservation was in fact at that one. My mother was pretty upset because for whatever reason when she looked up Lazy Dog's it pulled up the Town Square location, which is kind of odd since we only live about 5 to 6 miles from Lazy Dog's in Downtown Summerlin. So best advice I can give there would to be make sure you double check the location you make the reservation for. I went back to talk to the host, Jeremy I believe his name was and I explained to him the situation. The place was packed so I absolutely expected to wait 30 mins or more. He came back and said that if our party didnt mind squeezing a lil bit together that he could have us seated in about 5 mins. Jeremy delivered and definitely got my birthday celebration back on the right track! I'm very appreciative to him for that. The next employee that I would like to comment on is you're waitress DARLENE!! She was not our waitress but the one for the large group of people next to us. I watched her as she was taking the order for the table, about 10 people I would say. She was taking all of their orders without any note pad and I actually watched her repeat back every single person's order. I was pretty impressed! She has a very inviting demeanor to her. She actually reminded me of one of my bestfriends, with the buzzed haircut and earrings so thats what caught my attention initially. My mother had asked her for something while she was passing our table. Darlene came back quickly and then started talking with all of us. We had told her that we were there celebrating mine and my cousin's birthdays. She said that the employees dont sing to celebrate birthdays but that she would come back and sing to me. Darlene came back once it was time for dessert and she serenaded me! She was right when she told us she has a voice of an angel and almost brought me to tears! Hahaha once she left my table could not stop talking about her and that we all thought she must be one of the managers because her customer service was out of this world!!!! We all decided that whenever we come back to visit that we will make sure to ask to be seated in her section. On our way out we asked the hostess for a manager so we could leave a comment about Darlene. Unfortunately the managers were in a meeting and we had to get going. We told the hostess how great Darlene is and she said that Darlene has only been working with the company for about 2 weeks. We were all shocked! I believe that Darlene is by far one of the best assests that Lazy Dog's (Downtown Summerlin) has! I will be looking forward to my next visit. I want to thank Jeremy the host and Darlene the waitress again for my making my birthday celebration one to remember!!  I totally forgot to say anything about the food because that's how great the service was! The food is ALWAYS delicious! I've never had an issue. My favorite dish there is the Sticky Ribs and Umami fries! Sooooo dang good! The Happy Hour there is also awesome!",

It's open until Midnight so I didn't have to rush to get there after I got off at 8Pm and I did't have to rush to eat my dinner.  Their beer selection was Awesome and happy hour prices were very cheap!  My wife and I shared the carrots, I got a pizza and my wife got the green Chile nachos.  We both had leftovers and enjoyed our meals.  My wife drank cocktails, one she liked, one she didn't.  Definitely my favorite Las Vegas restaurant!",

Like most Lazy dog restaurant I've been too, the a decor  is always inviting and great,friendly staff especially this location, I've been to other locations in California before too.  The staff was really nice and very patient with us, my family really enjoyed their gourmet burgers and Hawaiian fried rice, which was delicious also. The wait was average for a restaurant.It wasn't that busy so it was nice  The deserts was good and made my kids happy!!!  Last time I was here, I came when the had happy hour and the food was Delicious then also!I always have had great service and good food so I will come back again!

Everything I've tried on the menu is solidly average in its category... No complaints, no surprises, but nothing to rave about.   On every visit, the service has been spotty at best... Slightly inattentive and a bit slower than what you want... but friendly enough not solicit a complaint... again, on par and expected for this type of establishment.

My problem is always trying to decide which of their great items I want to choose during any given visit. I love their chicken pot pie, the beef dip sandwich. beef pot roast dinner and schnitzel (seasonal item).  They only reason that they don't get a five star rating is due to the spotty nature of their service. On more than one occasion, we have sat for up to 10 minutes before ever having a server appear to greet us. We have had some really good servers and we have had some rather poor ones. It is a crap shoot as to which you will get when you are taken to your table.  But, bottom line, the food is great, the portions are large and the prices are reasonable.

Days out for my wife and I are few and far between these days, with two young boys at home, so we were grateful to hit a jackpot in finding ourselves at Lazy Dog on a day we luck out with a babysitter.  We actually started in the a.m., meeting friends here for brunch and day drinking. The beers at Lazy Dog are ok, but any lacking in that department has been made up for by excellent service every time.   I was torn on what to order, but the server, Steve's, recommendation on the carnitas brunch special, could not have been better! I wish I could've ordered like three of them! Everyone else in our group seemed to enjoy their respective entrees, too. Steve gave us top notch service the whole time, making sure we were well-taken-care-of from start to finish. After the main course, we ordered the Apple-Huckleberry Open-Faced Pie for dessert, which was also delicious and ultimately devoured.  Then, we went to a movie, stopped at a couple other places, and found ourselves back at Lazy Dog almost 6 hours later. Steve was still working away, but Carrie, at the bar was also excellent. Sharing in my attempt at humor and providing excellent service, I wish all my bartenders were as engaging as she.  Candidly, I went to Lazy Dog as a brew house and was underwhelmed, but I will return for the good food, as recommended by Steve, and by the awesome service from folks like Steve and Carrie! Thanks, Lazy Dog staff, and Manager Daniel, for a job well done!",

For dinner we got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with corn succotash, and the chicken pot pie with a side of white rice. Would def recommend.   Dessert we were set on the salted caramel creme brule, and it turned out that they were out of it. Sad. But don't worry, their manager comp'd our dessert and told us to pick anyone else. So we got the butter cake with vanilla bean ice cream, strawberries and a balsamic reduction. We couldn't have gotten a better dessert. I would honestly just come back for that!   10/10 would recommend Lazy Dog to anyone shopping in Downtown Summerlin or just anyone looking for a nice meal. Also, have a dog?

    "text": "+1 huge, killer patio for al fresco dining! +1 it's dog friendly AND the staff is friendly +1 early and late HH (M-F 3-6, another one starts at 9 certain days)  I have a confession. I am a cat person! I love dogs, too. I just don't own one. YET. I kind of avoided this place at first because I thought it would be packed with canines and their owners, but other than a bunch of dog-theme decor (check out the fire hydrant draft beer spouts!), I didn't see much of the furry critters.*  Menu is a smorgasbord of apps, Asian dishes, pizzas, classic American dishes, and some soups, salads, and sandwiches too. In other words, you may have a hard time deciding. The VEGGIE LAVASH SANDWICH is indulgent but healthy (650 calories but packed with fresh veggies). I especially liked the thick-cut Gouda and sundried tomato hummus! Upgraded side of Cajun fries with spicy ranch dipping sauce is worth the $1 surcharge, even if they invalidate your healthy entree decision.  The CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP is hearty, and the RED POMEGRANATE SANGRIA ($4/HH) is also fair, but not must-get dishes.   *Check out the website for the Dos and Don'ts of bringing your pup.",

    "text": "So we ventured off to Summerlin today for dinner to try this new place.  Why?  I was told that they have HATCH chili and I love me some Hatch Chili.   We sat outside with this perfect weather.  Ordered the seasonal mason jar and some Cajun fries to tame the hunger.  Ordered some Hatch Chili Bacon Mac & Cheese and let me tell you what treat. It's the little things sometimes that make you happy.   Also tried the  grilled cheese and for sure those two were amazing and worth the trip for good hatch chili and  grilled cheese made to perfection, especially when you need some tasty comfort food!   This place is ultra dog friendly, hence the name Lazy Dog  you can sit outside and enjoy the view, the dogs and the amazing fire pit. I ordered the Chicken Poblano, it was good, but came out a little cold. The concept of the crispy tamale cake with the roasted peppers and cream sauce which was really more like a tomatillo sauce, but still tasty.  It would have been better if it was hot and  served over the tamale cake and the roasted peppers with the white chunks of chicken.  Nonetheless a place worthy of return especially with friends for an evening out and your furry friend.  I will be back for the grilled cheese and next time I'll have it with the chicken tortilla soup  and maybe ask for some roasted hatch chili on my tortilla soup.. I think I just made myself hungry again.",

    "text": "My husband and I along with our daughter and grandson ate at the Downtown Summerlin location of TheLazy Dog this past week. I usually enjoy leaving positive reviews because I believe too often, people share anything that is bad and usually not the good. But, unfortunately we had an awful experience at the location. I ordered the turkey with cranberry salad sandwich. It had very little flavor.  My husband ordered shrimp tacos and honestly there had to be half a head of lettuce left over after eating the tacos. He said all he could really taste was the lettuce. My daughter ordered a pizza and had to wait over 20 minutes for a waitress to return so we could ask for red pepper flakes. Granted, this was 12/23  and the place was busy with holiday shoppers, but that doesn't excuse waiting 15 minutes just to turn in drink orders. Then we waited again to turn in food orders. Once food was delivered, we did not see our server,Isabel, again for at least 45 minutes, we only saw her because we snagged another employee to please pass a message that we needed more drinks since we'd been out for over a half hour by now.  Being without a drink for 30 minutes is no easy task when faced with a flavorless turkey sandwich and a head of chopped lettuce. I loved the atmosphere in their restaurant and although I though the staff was friendly, I won't be returning. My husband and I make it a habit of leaving 25% minimum tip but in this case, Isabel only received a 4.00 tip on a 50 something dollar tab. I figured I should tip because we did get our drinks and the correct food thaws ordered.  The fact that we didn't enjoy the dishes is not her fault but that if the cook. But giving a smidgen of attention to your customers might turn out good In the end",

    "text": "let me start out with having \"one of those days\" was not going to help this review. we were waiting for a table and they passed us twice and then when we did get seated no one wanted to state that it was their table after we had to go to the hostess stand and tell them to send over the manager because hopefully they wouldn't be too busy to server us. Well a server came by and state that he noticed that we were sitting for a long time and that he wasn't our server but would be happy to get us started on our drinks, as he was walking away the manager walked up and our actual server was right behind her. The manager said that she was so sorry but there was confusion in who's table it was and that it was cleared up now and that \"she\" (pointing at he server) was here to take our order or answer any questions we had on the menu. The manager offered to comp our appetizers and to let her know if there was anything else she could do for us. She leaves and the server doesn't apologize at all and says so what appetizer would you like......I answered her and said \"ok.....well I'm sorry would be nice considering the other server told us that you were our server and said that you were too buzy to get us and you were trying to get someone else to pick us up\" she snapped back said \"do you want me to server you or not\" I was eye-balled by my family and so I decided to just order and get our food, considering how hungry my family was. It didn't stop there though. She was just rude the rest of the time and I let her know that I would never treat anyone the way she was treating us because it wasn't our fault that she let us hang for 20 minutes without even telling us that she would be with us as soon as she could. Not only that but why she couldn't let her boss know that she needed help with her section. She didn't snapped back this time, but just put the check down and walked away. this was the 1st and last time, never again!!!! I would of gone to the manager about her unbelievable disrespectful attitude, but seriously it was a waste of time....normally a manager thinks the only reason why a customer makes a complaint is to get free food and that is not the case......I figured I just read a review and let the people know the truth. The food was interesting and different. dogs at the table seem a bit weird to me, but I wont have to worry about that because I'm never going back!!",

We sat down about 10 minutes before hh ended and was surprised that no one came over for a full 15 mins.  Usually we are greeted immediately and receive quick and excellent service.  Today our server was James and he was disappointing.  We ordered a happy hour margarita pizza and he charged us for a full size.  My husband let it go because he was pretty hungry and was going to eat it anyways  but when he ordered a second beer before our mains came he waited 30 mins and we had to call James over and ask where it was.  He did not apologize for the 30 min wait just said he was just about to check on it.  The sun had set and he no longer want the beer, so he sent it back.  It was given to him anyways and taken off the check, but it was the wrong beer anyways lol.  Not great, James!",

My girlfriend and I both ordered salads this time around and they were delicious. The Cobb is one of the best I've tasted and the Tex Mex was awesome too. For desert we had the white chocolate brownie (heaven). Overall great date night for my love. Please if you find yourself in downtown Summerlin, you have to try this place out.",

Given the choice of seating we chose a booth near the kitchen. In advance it looked to be a little quieter then the seating closer to the bar. And it was. The dining space is large but separated by half height walls. The decor the a nice mix of wood and steel. Wall art is a combination of dog photos and metal sculptures of various animals. The background music was not loud enough to interfere with our conversation. The restaurant and bar is well lit by large windows on two walls  Our server Daria greeted us and asked if this was our first visit. She extended a warm welcome and offered to answer any questions.  The menu has many choices both for dinner and lunch. After receiving our drinks a large round flatbread cut into 8 slices arrived at our table. Daria explained that it was a complementary welcome starter for our first visit. The flatbread is made to order with garlic and Parmesan cheese. It was very tasty and filling.. Enough left over to bring home.  The general manager Phil stopped by the table and extended us his personal welcome to the Lazy Dog family.   The entrees selected were the Blackened Chicken Burrito Bowl and  All-American Burger Blackened Chicken Burrito Bowl contains chopped chicken breast on top of Spanish rice and shredded cabbage, served with avocado, black beans, hatch chiles, jack and cheddar cheeses, house made salsa and fresh cilantro. This is a lunch special and is large enough to serve as a dinner entree. The flavors were fresh and delicious. The All American Burger is two charbroiled quarter-pound beef patties layered with melted American Cheese and topped with shredded lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickles and a large mound of french fries on the side. The burger was cooked perfectly as ordered and had a great beef flavor. The fries were firm and  UN greasy. In order to get through the burger some of the large bun had to be sacrificed. We look forward to a return to sample the Happy Hour menu which begins at 3 PM and can be a Late Late lunch and an Early Early dinner.",

    "text": "The lack of starness can be attributed mostly to the atmosphere on this particular Friday night.  We were seated in the two person booths off the bar next to a very loud party.  (Annoying, but not the restaurant's fault).  Even worse, my seat shared a wall with the swinging door that led to the patio.  Every five seconds this door slammed, shaking my very seat like a 7.3 earthquake.   The online menu we accessed included a buffalo chicken sandwich but I guess this locale has reduced their menu....no buffalo chicken.  Instead, I had a tasty pulled pork sandwich with onion strings on the side, coleslaw on top ($10.95).  Also a 105ish calorie coconut mojito ($8.50) that was refreshing.  Service was speedy and polite.  We waited the longest (10-15 minutes) for our to go dessert.  All in all...good menu and drink selections but beware the noise level inside on busy nights.",

Beer and drinks are great. Food quality is great. Different flavors for everyone. No mistakes today for lunch. Server was very attentive which was great. Prices are reasonable for Las Vegas. Not a fast food garbage restaurant. Good environment for groups and social gatherings. Definitely try it out. I feel Lazy Dog is a great addition to Las Vegas restaurant scene.",

We're typical so, we tried their favorite dishes : the Bleu Burger with Sweet Potato Tater Tots and the Sundried Tomato Pasta w/ Chicken. I wanted to try their dessert but, we had plans and that might've taken possibly another hour. They gave samples on the beer and as I said before, very knowledgeable about everything. Great atmosphere, perfect for singles, couples, groups, families ... you name it! We will be back again... of course, when we have nothing else planned",

    "text": "Quick Look: Brand new, large restaurant structure in Downtown Summerlin. Unfortunately, the nice new build out could not make up for the bland and tasteless food.   In Depth Review: I know it's a corporate \"chain\" restaurant, but I had driven by a busy Lazy Dog several times and thought it must be good, just look at all those people. Tried it on Wednesday, July 29th at 7pm. The restaurant was packed out and bananas. People seem to love that chain restaurant food here. The hostess sat us in a small two person booth in the back near the kitchen and a fireplace. Was not the best seat as a serving station was directly behind me, and I had servers chatting away and pounding on a point of sale system over my shoulder.   Our server was attentive and very friendly. We placed our drink and appetizer order. I told her we would wait to place our dinner entree order as we did not want to be rushed out. She seemed confused by this. Glad we made this decision as the kitchen was cranking food out at a super fast pace and timing was off. Our drinks arrived, and then our brick oven spinach and sun dried tomato cheese dip was brought out. About 5 minutes after we ordered it. It was in a baking dish and it was a boiling hot liquid. Did not look like any cheese dip I have ever seen or had before. Had the consistency of water. Was so hot we had to stir it for another 10 minutes before we could eat it. Sadly, it missed the mark and was bland. Could not taste the sun dried tomatoes, or the cheese flavor at all.   For our entree we ordered the new fennel sausage, goat cheese and mushroom pizza. We also each ordered a Caesar salad. The salads came out and were a generous size. Within 2 minutes of our salads arriving they brought out our pizza. The table was a small two person size, so we were now sitting there all crowded and trying not to make a wrong move and knock something off the table by mistake. Timing was off big time, would have been nice to enjoy our salads prior to bringing out the entree. Our server apologized and blamed it on the kitchen. The pizza did not come with a spatula (pizza server). They said they did not have them to offer. Never experienced this at a place that offers a entire section of pizzas. Buy some dang spatulas (pizza servers) and offer them to your guests. We had to rip the slices by hand. The cheese and toppings that had not been firmly cut through in the kitchen slid off a few slices, this was annoying. The pizza looked great, but again it fell short and tasted bland. The dough was fluffy and the crust was very chewy. Not the typical brink oven taste we expected. It wasn't a horrible pizza, it was just not memorable. They give you a Styrofoam container to take the slices home that you do not eat. Most places that offer pizzas (think BJ's) will give a small pizza box to put slices in. So we had to stack and bend them to get them to fit properly. We would pass on desert as we were not feeling it at this point and just wanted to go home.    In Summary: The drinks were good. The beer was cold. The service was attentive and friendly. Sadly the kitchen and the food failed to deliver. The entire experience was not that memorable. If I want to go to a chain restaurant with a similar festive atmosphere, I will take my business to the consistent and tasty Yard House up the street. Besides being able to sit on the patio with your dog, I guess I am failing to see what the big attraction is at Lazy Dog?",

    "text": "DREA DREA DREA!!!  Best Bartender in Vegas! She is very knowledgeable about the food and drinks that Lazy Dog has to offer. She is also amazing at giving recommendations.   BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE! Drea is a extremely skilled ninja making sure your glass is always full and that you are taken care of. Some how she always knows when my glass is empty and needs a refill.   ORGANIZED & CLEAN! I have never seen any other bartender work so hard at keeping the bar so clean. Drea never stops moving her ninja like hands. If she is not serving the guests or making crazy drinks like some kind of robot, she is organizing and cleaning. I always see her serve a drink immediately followed by cleaning the bar top, wash a rack full of glasses, put in a food order, finished with making countless drinks for the rest of the restaurant.  FIVE STARS! I not only give Drea 5 stars but the entire Lazy Dog staff and management for creating such an amazing dinning and drinking experience.",

I arrived at the area a bit early before my friend did but went ahead inside anyways and as soon as I entered the door - the hosts, who were standing at their podium saw me walked in but they didn't even acknowledge me, they didn't even asked If I have a table reserved or if I have been helped or even just to say hello. So I decided to just sit on the bench by the door while I waited for my friend. Its not that I wanted the attention I just thought they should acknowledge/greet anyone that  walks in to their venue.  Other than that,  our server was great, she was very nice and always came to  check on us to see If we needed anything. I ordered steak and it was perfect but I think I loved the dessert more which was white chocolate chip  brownie with vanilla ice cream...it was so good....I give it a four star just because the people at the door weren't as cordial as they should be. Cant wait to take our dog here...",

The waiter didn't mind this at all and he was super nice about it. Creme brulee for dessert, also delicious. The drinks are an interesting, flavorful and delicious mixture.

I always get the inside out quesadilla, buffalo chicken nuggets and chicken strips! I also get a few new things to try too. The lemon drop Martini my favorite and is $6 on the happy hour menu.

The busier this place gets, the lower the quality of food is I've noticed. It is a popular spot though because the food here is shockingly cheap compared to a lot of other restaurants and they have a wonderful beer selection but I have a major beef with this place, hence the reason it only gets 3 stars.   The dishes they do well, they do great at. But the problem is that their menu is constantly changing so instead of getting better at their dishes, they would rather put out mediocre seasonal items, and constantly change their menu instead of getting better at what they are great at and giving their menu a little stability. For example, they had some the most amazing chicken tenders and fries basket. I'm talking some of the best chicken strips on the planet but they pulled them from their menu and replaced them with these mediocre buffalo chicken pops. Why do that? Why not just keep making what people love instead of making them feel forced to try something new? I get having seasonal items is important but not when the quality of food suffers. That said, they do have a lot of wonderful regular food items to choose from but they have no problem taking it off the menu with little or no notice to try something different that may or may not work out.",

The chicken was delicious! It was nice and tender as well. The sauce on the chicken plus the cheese made it so that the chicken wouldn't be so dry. As well as the strawberry lemonade.

I also do enjoy that you can have your dogs outside - a nice perk to the Vegas scene because most places will not allow you to have pets at a restaurant. They have dog food too and they bring out water bowls - very classy and a nice place to bring your pet after a hike at red Rock.   Since going vegan, I'm not sure how much I can eat there, also being gluten free but the place is nice if you don't have any limitations on your diet - though I do recommend the switch to vegan! Always will and I promise you, the animals you save today will be just as happy one day as your precious puppy that you have so graciously brought to a pup friendly place like this.  Don't forget - cows, pigs and chickens would love hugs and kisses as much as your dog. The irony of eating a steak or chicken sandwich as your perfect doggie sits next to you, waiting to go home and snuggle up with some bed time treats is tangible.",

The girl working the reservation and check-in podium was friendly and did a good job. The hostess was somewhat robotic and she laid the menus upside down on the table. Nobody here wears a name tag.  The server, Jennifer, was extremely attentive and efficient, even though she seemed to be working a large number of tables. The appetizers arrived in a reasonable time, but then the entrees arrived while we were only half-way through the appetizers.  The food was great, every bite was delicious. The portion sizes were a bit small.  The restaurant decor has a western theme. The menus are leather covered and the ceiling lights are covered with leather shades stitched together with leather laces. The tableware is heavy duty.  The drink ad sitting on the table was in a cast iron frame and the bowl containing the lettuce wrap filling was cast iron. The plates are thick and heavy. The beverage glasses are large and heavy and the straws are extra large sturdy plastic.  Too bad they do not serve milkshakes here.  The noise level in the dining room is high; it is a very large room and the large number of people talking at the same time creates a  continuous din.  It would have been helpful to include a serving utensil with the lettuce wrap.",

    "text": "Stopped in after a short shopping trip; somewhat hungry and a beer would be great!  The beer and bar staff was indeed great.  The team was attentive, talkative, and busy.  Those who were not attending customers were busy setting up bar, cleaning etc.  My tender introduced all team members by name, that was nice.    Food: I have eaten here before and it is not memorable.  I think there was a flatbread involved.  My personal test is how the basic burger performs.  I ordered one from the bar menu, $6 (but only this price if ordered after 9pm-otherwise $11), if as good as McCormick & Schmick's bar burger, I would consider moving closer to Summerlin.  The burger that arrived was not at all impressive.  First look told me those fries were fresh half an hour ago.  Now they are wilted and barely warm.  The burger, goodness I hope it tastes better than it looks, but no it does not.  Two single patties, cheese, pickle, special sauce on a~no it is not McDonalds Big Mac, but maybe it is?  No sesame seed bun.  I cut 1/4 of it because I measure halves so the big side goes to someone else.  Today it went in the garbage, not worthy to take home.  I was surprised when my bill came and I was charged $11.  Bartender had manager reduce to bar price.  The small print be damned, take it off the $6 menu.  Actually, if this is the $11 burger, just take it away completely as it is a monumental fail for a \"scratch\" restaurant.  I get it is a loss-leader, but you lost me as a return customer.  The bar food should impress and make me want to come for dinner.    In closing, go for the brew and eat elsewhere as there are plenty of options.  The atmosphere is nice and the bar service very good, however from my experience the food is forgettable disappointment.",

If you have a dog you can bring them in at the patio too.   We ordered the breakfast pizza, omelet, and they berry pancakes. The breakfast pizza was great but a bit too over cooked on the crust. It was slightly tough to chew the crust but the sunny side up eggs was a great addition. The omelet was good but nothing extraordinary. But man o man the pancake was amazing. First off, two people could share it. It taste amazing when it first comes out and the whipped cream was light! I didn't feel the need to add the syrup but it is available if one does need it.  For our party of three all that cost about 35$ which is a steal! The portions were amazingly hearty and the prices were low! I just found a new favorite brunch place! I will definitely come back to try their lunch and dinner menu too!",

They have amazing and fast services and also have a outside patio just for your furry friends! There's also a big bonfire outside and heaters if you do decide to dine outside. This place has a nice dining experience in a very easy and relaxing atmosphere.   They have amazing staff services, our server was super knowledgeable about the menu, and gave us feedbacks and opinions on certain dishes and he was always ready to answer any questions. The only complaint i have was when i was first inside, 2 host didn't realize that i had gotten there first and seated someone else before me because they weren't looking, so tip just make sure you flag them down constantly. But that's the only complaint i have because the rest of the other workers were so sweet and helpful. Clean place (with adorable dog deco) & environment with a beautiful scenery. The food also came our fast and yummy!!   Tips: (w. your furry ones)  -You're not allowed to have your pup on your lap or chair so they must be on the floor  -Staffs can't pet your dog  -There's menu options for your pup & waterbowls! -You can't share with your pup  -They have to be on leashes  The food was high quality and delicious! I was here for the happy menu this time (for this review purpose only w/ pictures) i got the chicken wings, the carbonara pasta, the sweet potato tator tots, and Banana pudding. The food was so good and comforting!  Chicken Wings: (Happy menu) 5 pieces per order ; juicy chicken wings with bbq and spicy flavor, creamy ranch and celery sticks   Carbonara pasta: Had bacon, sweet peas, garlic, romano, poached egg, chardonnay cream sauce! (With cheese chips) This was so creamy flavorful, and all the ingredients really balanced out with each other.   Banana Pudding: It was a HOMEMADE banana pudding, with banana slices, whip creams and vanilla nilla wafers! The pudding had a rich creamy and thick constancy with layers of banana slices and wafers  Sweet potato tator tots:  Super crispy and sweet, with homemade lime jalapeno aioli  I recommend trying this place when you're in the area or just ever want to spoil yourself and your pup with amazing dining!",

I loved the artwork in the menus, the atmosphere, and the flannels the staff wore. The food was good, especially the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake for dessert. There are two reasons this review isn't getting a full 5 stars. The first is just minor cleanliness. Where my boyfriend I were sitting, there was a division type wall between seating areas. It was pretty dang dusty. It was eye level, so kinda hard to ignore. The second reason for the lack of a 5th star was the pace of the staff. The manager came to our table three times. Once to ask how our food came out (normal manager duty), a second time to clear our plates, and a third to refill my boyfriends drink. The food runners and wait staff moved at a glacial speed; no sense of urgency in their steps. Everyone seemed friendly enough, but they've really gotta work on their hustle.",

The it took another 10 minutes to  get our water and chocolate milk. Our food order came out almost immediately after that (a cobb salad and children s noodles with apple slices and carrots) however, I had no silverware to eat with and the only thing my son got was apple slices. I told the runner we need the noodles and carrots. She brought back the noodles, I said still need the carrots. She explained to me only 1 thing comes with the noodles and you got your apple slices. I stated, i had also ordered carrots. She got into a small debate because she stated they are extra and I told her I KNOW and I ORDERED THEM! So 4 minutes later his carrot slices arrived from the waitress. Keep in mind i still have no silver ware. I asked her to bring some and she did.  On to the meal. The cobb salad right off the bat seemed a little off. I ate half of it. It took quite a while to get bill, we paid and left. My stomach was very yucky for the better part of a day and a half. Not good.",

Tonight, I absolutely must post about the phenomenal service I recieved from my server, Adam.  I dined alone, as I am new to town. Despite the place being packed, I felt welcomed immediately.  None of that \"oh you are a party of one\" face to which I have become so accostomed.  Not the standard broken record, \"hello my name is\" but truly welcomed.    He immediately asked if I would like another drink--the first came from the bar--and gave me his suggestion for the mango jalepeno margarita when I asked for something different.  Excellent suggestion!  And, it paired perfectly with my burger.  The veggie burger was delicious.  The cajun fries were a good upsell.    The timing came out wonderfully.  Adam checked on me often, but not too often.  He was warm and funny and just a joy.",

Chicken was good but it's more like chicken fried steak. I was expecting traditional fried chicken. Still it was a delicious meal so not a big deal, though I'm sure future patrons who are pickier will point that out.   I also had the jamaican lemonade? It was very tart. It probably could use more sugar, or less lemonade.   I would come again here if I'm at Summerlin side of town. Would like to try the rest of the menu. Price is very good as well.",

Well, we finally went this weekend and it was a very cool joint.  The place was absolutely packed with humans and dogs alike. We didn't have our dog with us, so we sat indoors in order to get a seat sooner.  The menu is pretty extensive and covers a wide variety of cuisine-types. My girlfriend and I both ordered off the lunch menu. I had the spicy garlic chicken noodle bowl and she had a personal pizza and salad. Everything was great.  They carry beers from the Pub at Goldenroad out of LA which is a big plus for us.  Atmosphere is pretty nice with a modern lodge feel and quite a few large tvs around the bar area.",

The architecture is beautiful and the ambiance is family oriented. Their food portions are large and the food is very good. The Thai salad was excellent. Would have given it 5 stars except it gets really busy and noisy (inside) so tough to have conversations. Overall, a great place to go.",

It was in one word AMAZING!!! David our server was courteous, welcoming, and very knowledgeable. Not only does the whole staff make you feel welcome, but when they found out that we were first time guests, they treated us like royalty!! Shaun the manager brought us their speciality garlic flatbread just to welcome us to the Lazy Dogs family. I will be back time and time again. Their Tortilla soup is also out of this world.  On to the entrees.... The chicken pesto and hummus salad plate was out of this world!!! The chicken was cooked to perfection and the pesto on top of the chicken was phenom! The mixed greens were very fresh as was the garlic pita served on the side.  The chicken tenders were hand breaded deliciousness. Tender flakey and flavorful. Their barbecue sauce served on the side was also a nice accommodation.  My girlfriend had their speciality red beer for her cocktail and it was well balanced and delicious, as was the blonde beer that I had. Definitely will be back again in the near future. Thanks Lazy Dog!!!",

Cons: wait times can be long but they do hustle to get you seated. My kids miss the licorice and fruit loop necklaces! Had undercooked chicken once and they scrapped it to make me a new dish but that took a long time and everyone else was done by the time it came. I am really weary of chicken and so anything even close to pink gets sent back.",

We usually order the whole menu(I usually come with a party of 4+.. and we're a little bit buzzed and hungry after bingo!lol) Everything is tasty! From the sweet potato tater tots, pizza,wings, Brussels sprouts, lettuce wraps and even poke. You gotta try the whole menu!   I've only had one incident here. I ordered wine, and the wine glass was pretty dirty... but that's all! It happens, sometimes you don't catch dirty dishes/glasses. They fixed the problem immediately.   It's a great place to have a few drinks and order a bunch of appetizers to share with friends/family. And obviously.. they're totally dog friendly!! But you have to eat outside, health code purposes !!",

We brought our pup on a trip out and came to eat here on the patio with all the other awesome pet owners! Our waitress was awesome! So friendly and made some good recommendations.  There was another server, not sure if she was actually out side, or just helping pass meals. Long story short, she had an attitude any time somebody's dog wasn't hiding under a table. If they were sitting or laying next to the owner she would grunt, roll eyes, and step over the dogs.   I just don't think somebody should be working in this environment if they don't like animals. Plenty of other jobs where you don't need that interactio.",

I normally dislike deviled eggs but the Crispy Deviled Eggs were surprisingly delicious bites.   I got the Black Bean Jackfruit Tostada, and other than being a bit soggy from everything piled on top it was amazing - great flavors! Perhaps a bit less on the topping though, and then the crispiness of the tostada would come through more. But I cleaned my plate, it was definitely good eats!  Even the signature cocktail was intriguing, I can't remember what it was called now but it had some sort of smoke imbued into it - very interesting.   The only reason this gets 4 stars is because the restaurant is extremely dimly lit and the ambience is rather medieval, which I don't really like for a daytime restaurant. Nice big windows, but needs more bright lighting over the tables please!",

    "text": "Why have I never been here before? We brought our dogs last night. We only take dogs where they are welcome. Awesome finding a restaurant that's pup friendly. I felt like my dogs were really catered to which made me happy. We were seated on the patio with all the other dogs. There were so many dogs here! The dogs have menu items of chicken or hamburger over rice (brown or white) with peas and carrots. Water was brought to our girls too. All dog stuff is brought and placed on table in disposable bowls. Very nice size portions and only $4.95. TVs had the Knight's game on. So it was a perfect evening. Wish there were more of these restaurants that welcomed dogs. We will definitely be back! A+ business! 2 paws up from my girls!",

Lacking in flavor. I like the ambiance and the $5 bloody Mary's. Service was good so that's disappointing. Wish this food was Better for the price we have paid.

The sauce was quite thick and the pasta tasted too chewy like it was undercooked. The corn chowder is decent but a little too heavy. The chicken wings and cajun fries are the kind you find at any bar.  I went there close to midnight and there was one server working the entire time. There were about 7 tables and it's just too much to ask for one server to handle! Needless to say it took forever to put in our order and to get the check. Can't blame the server but management should really have more than one person working??  All in all, it's a decent place but it's a very tough sell considering all the other food choices you can pick from around the area. There's far better options and Lazy Dog just didn't impress me too much. I will most likely return for their drinks and maybe try the food again then, but my first impression of the place was MEH.",

There were only three other tables in our section (a booth of four, a table of four with only drinks, and a table of ten). All of the lettuce in our salads (Cesar and Thai) was brown and looked questionable. The whole time I was eating I thought \"This will probably make me sick later.\" I had the chicken club and it was dry and bland. Steak and fries were bland as well. Save your time and money and head to Applebee's or Chili's - better flavor for better prices.",

The first time I came with my aunt for lunch and ordered the tortilla soup and Cesar salad. She had asked for the dressing on the side and they made a mistake and put it on. They were so sorry about it they removed it from the bill. I thought that was really nice of them. The next time I came for dinner with some friends and ordered way too much. I order the hatch chile & bacon mac and cheese, loaded potato hush puppies, and some drinks. My friends ordered the chicken pablano, cheese pizza, and black and blue burger. The mac and cheese was a little spicy but very good. The hush puppies were good but I didn't have room to finish them so i took them home. Our waitress was the best. She had great recommendation and really knew the plates. I like when people know what they are talking about and can give you suggestions. We also order the sangria sampler which is a great idea. You get 3 little mason jars. They have peach, raspberry, and pomegranate. It's a cool place in downtown summerlin and i'll be back to try more of their menu.",

My husband had the pot pie. He ate it all of it. He also felt there was no flavor.  I only tried a small piece of the crust. And it was ok.  I have to say I would not return.",

Today, I am here for lunch. Didn't realize they had an awesome selection for brunch as well. Brunch drinks start at ONLY $5! For food, going to order one of the lunch specials, sweet & spicy noodle bowl. Stay tuned for my reviews of those!",

He'd mentioned that they had a patio where patrons could bring their dogs to eat with them, and as an avid dog lover, I was immediately intrigued.  The restaurant sits in the far northwest section of Downtown Summerlin.  It's a stand alone building, so it's pretty easy to find.  We were greeted by very friendly staff and were seated right away.  The waiter showed up promptly, offered suggestions from the menu, took our drink order and returned with our beverages very quickly. He was friendly, knowledgable about the menu, and professional.   The menu is robust without being overwhelming.  There are interesting appetizers, salads and entrees for just about every appetite.  I decided on the Spicy Thai Chicken Salad.  The food came out in under 15 minutes.  My salad was fresh, filling and had just the right amount of kick.  Kudos for mixing the chicken throughout the salad, rather than piling it all on top.  And some extra recognition to our server for excellent service.  Jack was literally taking the last sip from his drink when the waiter showed up with a refill.  Awesome!  With the cool paw print decor everywhere, excellent service, and some pretty tasty food, Lazy Dog will certainly become a regular spot for me.",

We've been here twice in the last couple weeks because we enjoyed the happy hour, however service has been HORRENDOUS it has taken at least 10-12 minutes each time for our server to greet us, and on top of that another 10-15 minutes to even get the drinks we ordered. Our food has come before our drinks were delivered which was very frustrating, and each time they were delivered, it was by someone else (each one very friendly) but our server was nowhere to be found. We were ready to go and waited for the check for a good 20 minutes. We saw her doing side work putting place settings down with out ever checking on us. Eventually we had to get up and ask for it.  This restaurant has all of the parts but the service which is the Biggest part because our experiences were both completely ruined, the servers name was marien.   I'd recommend the bar or restaurant area rather than running the risk of getting her",

The rice had no stickiness to it either. I would try something different next time.  There are a lot of options, but this smacks of one of those places that serves everything and specializes in nothing. Their top shelf margarita was good and they have a mojito with coconut rum that was very refreshing. The positive here is that you can take a family and there will be something for everyone.",

We have always come for late night Happy Hour, never had to wait, and have sat on the Patio which is great. We have had a really great waitress, an ok waitress and a really odd waitress. The last one was the really odd one and she was very flighty, couldn't seem to follow what we wanted and just not all together there.  This last time I ordered a drink I have had each time, a sparkling Strawberry Margarita, and while it was great both times before, this time it arrived completely flat. I tried to drink it but it was gross so I asked if they could remake it, they did, this time it was fizzy but I am pretty sure it had zero booze in it. Very disappointing. I gave up and got the house Hef, which was just ok.   Things we have gotten:  Late night burger: Comes with different things on it each time. Last time husband said no mayonnaise or sauce, comes with sauce, had to send it back, waitress insisted it was the wrong burger and husband says that the girl that delivered it said it was the late night burger, waitress comments \"well we don't hire them for their brains\"......that was rather shocking.  Hummus Trio: Hummus is good, cucumber has ranged from good to soft and floppy, bread has ranged from great to terrible  Mashed potato bites: Have been good each time, but the heat of the sauce has varied a lot  Buffalo chicken bites: Horrific....weird rubber texture  Canjun Fries: Yummy  Edamame: Yummy  So, after last time, which was the worst visit so far, I have no idea when/if we will be back. So far the nice patio has been the only consistent thing about our visits and frankly if sitting outside is the best part of your dining experience, then something is wrong with the place.",

She moved to the Town Square location which is closer to our house so we love seeing her there now.  My only negative feedback is that they have gotten quite a bit of new staff at this location (summerlin) and they are far more lackluster, besides a few gems. We have had the same hostess greet us at least 4 times and she does anything but greet us. She usually stares at us blankly and waits for us to talk... she doesn't ask us preference or ask anything about happy hour seating or make any friendly conversation. A greeter should make you feel welcome, excited, and accommodated from the second you walk through the doors and every moment till you're sat where the server takes over. None of those things happened and we almost feel like we're inconveniencing her.   Back to the positive though - the food and atmosphere overall are still great and we've had plenty of positive experiences with some of the servers too!",

I got the Black N Blue Burger, My friend Steak, another Spicy Burger. The taste was ok to good and cold. A fly flew around us and on top of our plates (not their fault he wandered in?) I was excited seeing it  has four stars but then disappointed. If the burger can be hot would be way better. Steak seemed pretty good. We also got pumpkin cheesecake, I wouldn't pay for this again, ok flavor great crust. Ginger Beer Woa Nelly Horrible tasted like ginger and soda water. Waitress was friendly but slow.

    "text": "Lazy Dog provides us with a perfect example of average. Good, but not great. A True 3 star restaurant in every way.  Let me break it down for you:  * The food is good. It is not great, but it doesn't try to be. The architects of this place have sought out to appeal to the largest percentage of tastes. All the right options, all the proper ingredients so that everyone can find something. It is the \"smart business\" way of doing restaurants, find the middle of the road dishes that appeal to the greatest number of people. This approach is very popular with the large corporate chain restaurants. * The service is good, but does not stand apart. Great service can only come from one place - it comes from servers who love what they do. There are several ways servers get to the point where they love what they do: great money, great schedule, great coworkers, great food, great management, great clientele, great location and great reputation are all factors that can affect how servers perform. This typically occurs when there are more \"great\" than \"good\" factors in this list. From the looks of it, Lazy Dog must have mostly \"good\". * The prices are poor, to say the least. Yes, I understand that the location is prime and rents are most likely higher than many areas on the east side of town (no offense to East Siders). But no matter how you try to paint your picture, people always have a sense of value when they eat out. We all have this inner voice that can accurately balance the price point of the meal to the overall quality/quantity. A good tasting meal that comes in large portions and is inexpensive is always a winner. A good tasting meal that comes in small portions and costs and arm and a leg is always a disappointment, except in the case where it adds a notch to our culinary bedpost (i.e. a meal at Masa in New York City, which costs $585 per person).  Lazy Dog will be a success, mostly because of the disposable income crowd who, amazingly enough, always have the worst taste when it comes to food (yes, I did mean to offend them).   Lazy Dog will always follow along with its namesake and keep making dishes that are just average. They will never takes risks, they will never go out on a limb. Their offerings will be good but not great, the prices will always be too high for their portions and their service will always be mediocre...  ...because that is the great American business model for success - be average.",

    "text": "My husband and I are always at Downtown Summerlin so we figured we try Lazy Dog. Looks like a chain restaurant with multiple locations (which it is), but never heard of it previously.   The interior is warm and approachable, but I couldn't put my finger on its design inspiration. Looks like New Mexico meets Claim Jumper? So curious that I actually looked into it when we were waiting for service. Turns out it's inspired by a lounging dog near a fireplace at a lodge in Grand Teton, WY. Pretty cool and touches home as my husband has fam up there.   The food is verrry eclectic, reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory in terms of - \"here is a bible of mediocre food offerings bound to interest somebody.\" However, our selections were really tasty! The green chili mac n cheese app was amazing, very flavorful. Ordered a low calorie pasta salad with great citrus under notes. The husband ordered the meatloaf, easily one of the tastiest I've ever had. Good cocktail selection too.  Not on my immediate return list, but I wasn't disappointed. A great place to bring a group of friends or family if you're in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "I had to get home get loose pants on before I could even think clearly enough to write a review! I ATE SO MUCH FOOD! This was our late Valentine's day dinner. Okay I'll get real. This is now one of my new favorites. We just so happened to come in on happy hour. Woot woot! He ordered a draft Coors light and i ordered the sampler. If you get in on the happy hours I highly suggest ordering the lazy dog sampler! Delicious! My favorite was the stout! Very smooth very satisfying like coffee.  We ordered the nachos, fire roasted pizza with sausage and chilli oil, mac n'cheese, and the stuffed hush puppies.  Now at the start of the night I already new I wanted nachos so I might be biased, but those were some killer nachos! Next their hush puppies were terribly good! Mashed potatoes breaded and fried. Very good. The pizza should have been a lower price but very good. The mac n'cheese was almost good. Didn't really hold up to everything else. We ate everything! After all that I ordered a lazy dog stout and dessert. I ordered the s'mores and he ordered what is so highly recommended by Yelp and by the waitresses, the butter cake. The butter cake pales in comparison to the s'mores! Omg it's like my favorite thing now even as full as I already was! That marshmallow!! Heavenly! The service could have been better. Now this place is pretty big but it was nearly empty. The waitress didn't come by nearly as often as she should have and she took far too long to bring me my beer. I was done with desert by the time she brought it though I ordered it before we ordered dessert. Very uncool. Then we waited far too long for her to pick up our check. Also as i said this place was nearly empty yet we were seated across or next to the waiters station. So we got to listen to their talk and so on all night. That was ridiculous since the whole place was clear for seating. It's literally 3 feet at the most from your table so all these waiters and waitresses are on your lap all night yet we didn't get the attention we should have. :-/ So the food is an absolute 5 stars and the service about a 4 star.  We left happy and ready for bed! O.~",

My friend kept saying you have to try the Mac and cheese and requested an order for all of us to try. It was so good I was sad I didn't order one for myself ( next time for sure )  I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with pimento cheese and seasonal fruit ( which was a big chunk of watermelon) I asked for the pickled jalapenos and carrots on the side, and I'm so glad I did.

All of what we ordered was like food you can whip up at home in about 10 minutes yourself haha. It would cost you less to do that! I mean $60 for a fried chicken sandwich, chicken entree with veggies and fries (as an appetizer) is a bit much. Well with a cocktail on the bill but come on man ha. The portions are disappointing too. Didn't taste all that good either to be honest. My fried chicken was uncomfortably pink. I knew it was cooked enough to eat but it makes you want it less! Just wasn't the place for me I guess. My wife ate her food but wasn't like satisfied you know?   Just trying to say you're not missing out on eating here if you're in downtown Summerlin. There's other spots with much better food and a bit cheaper.   Service wasn't good either. Not once did we get a refill on either drink we were there for an hour or more....and she was never around it seemed. Didn't even bring us the food or anything! Come to think of it not even our drinks! Haha OR THE FRICKING BILL! A bunch of other random employees brought it all. Telling you the truth it wasn't busy so unsure why we weren't visited more often. I feel inclined to say we did still tip 20%. Wow that's funny she probably wanted to avoid me after writing down the wrong thing and me getting that wrong dish. I even pointed right at it on the menu and asked her questions about it. She answered them, but yet somehow thought I was talking about something else...I'm not perfect and I'm an air head too, but I'm only saying this because she was trying to passively tell me that's not what happened. I immediately kept just throwing \"ok\" and \"it's fine, no worries\" at her only because I refuse to use my energy arguing about a sandwich. I'm  guessing that's why my fried chicken sandwich was pink I got it 3 mins later...",

This is one of those chains that so far has always been consistent from Torrance to Vegas they all taste the same. Roasted chicken and Havarti sandwich with a wedge salad is always my go to. Big enough to share with someone. Lisa was ah-mazing! She was on it, never had to ask for a thing it was always there before I needed it. Loved her. Will ask to be seated with her on future visits. If anyone from corporate ever reads these: PLEASE don't ever take that sandwich off the menu!   Too bad I stuffed my face so fast I forgot to take a picture. Oh well there's always next time.",

The human food is always fresh and delicious, and the staff is always friendly and polite.  My favorite is the white chocolate brownie served warm with vanilla ice cream topped with hot fudge. We have been there many times and never had a bad experience.  It's so much fun to take your loving baby out to eat at a restaurant that truly wants them there. We will be back or my dog will be bummed",

We ordered the crispy ribs and umami fries (which include a sauce that will make you pass out it's that good). The balance of Chinese five spice and traditional seasoning made the crispy fried ribs a new favorite.   We also ordered the green Chili chicken nachos, which were quite spicy but a very savory flavor.  All of our food was fantastic, so we figured that the name must signify the service. Our server was less than attentive and we had to repeat many times what we needed to get our drinks refilled. Also, the food came staggered when it was supposed to come out together.   All in all great food, just don't hold your breath for outstanding service.",

Their response time was quick and I commend that, as most restaurants don't even care if you leave a bad review. This time around we walked in about 530 for an early dinner, got seated immediately (inside as it was too hot to be outdoors) and service was great. Wonderful, friendly and prompt but not rushed service. I had the same salad as before, as it's seasonal and will be sad once it's no longer on their menu... was wonderful like last time. We were checked on after each course and asked if we needed anything. Towards the end of our meal our waitress saw me fighting with the marshmallow on their s'mores dessert (great for chocolate lovers btw) and quickly brought us more napkins and laughed with us about it. Had the butter cake again, it's really one of my favorites now! Will definitely be back, and recommend this place to others! Thanks for turning around our experience here!",

You can bring your pets with you, but you'll be seated outside on the patio.   I've ordered a few things from here but one of my favorites is the Alfredo fettuccini with shrimp. Sooo yums! It's hard to mess up pasta lol but theirs is very creamy and the pasta is cooked well. It comes with 2 pieces of pita crackers? I think that's what it is. & they definitely don't skimp on the shrimp! I'm not quite sure what the name of the dessert I took a pic of but it was delicious! It was shared between a couple of people & was enjoyed by every single one of them.   If I remember correctly, the lighting is pretty dim, especially when it's already dark outside lol. Will definitely be back but probs to the location closer to home!",

They need to up the flavor because the chicken and beans is quite bland The dirty dog is quite dirty and doesn't need to be topped with potato chips as it is quite good without!  Waffle cut Parmesan chips should be replaced with a fresh herb salad as it doesn't pair well because it can either be to greasy or dry ...",

There's appetizers, small plates, salads, sandwiches, and entrees. We started with a flight of beer and the coconut pineapple infused drink along with buffalo cauliflower and candy bacon. Delicious. For the main entree, we had fish tacos and chicken sandwich. The fish tacos looked like they were made out of Gorton's fish. I should have asked but I was expecting grilled fish in my fish tacos. I wouldn't get the fish tacos again, but I would purchased the other items again. The fish tacos came with black beans and green onions along with Spanish rice with corn, peas, carrots mixed in. The chicken sandwich came with french fries.   The highlight of the meal was the candy bacon and buffalo cauliflower.   The portions were generous. The price is on par with the average restaurant. They are dog friendly and have a place for your dogs when you arrive. No need to leave the fur babies at home.   Despite not really liking the fish tacos, I would come here again.",

After telling the server it was our 1st time there the manager came over and gave us in order of their housemade waffle potato chips. I highly recommend them because somehow they're light and crispy without being greasy and that's pretty impressive. Liz was our server and did an incredible job keeping  Our refills coming and meeting our every need from special requests for paper napkins to answering questions about what items we should try on our 1st visit.  The food was absolutely fantastic. My husband had the chicken pot pie and the only concern we had was that the chunks of chicken were too big. Lol.  I had the Thai peanut noodles with shrimp and tofu and it was absolutely amazing and it was such a large portion that after our appetizer of caeso I could not eat at all and it was delicious reheated the next day. The Jamaican lemonade was BOMB! Highly recommend.  For specialty non-alcoholic drinks the refills are not free however they only charge you HALF price for refills.  Honestly it was 5 stars across-the-board and if you look at the photos I took you'll see that the food is beautiful as well as delicious and I cannot wait to go here again. Maybe next time I'll even bring my doggy along since their patio is dog friendly and they have a special menu just for your dogs.  :)",

As long as you sit in the bar area and stick to what is on happy hour you're golden.   Why buffalo cauliflower is 900+ calories is absolutely beyond me, but let me tell you I licked the plate clean. And I was on a date.   The seasonal galette dessert was described to be excellent, but it was just ok.   The calamari was not very good It tasted more like rice cakes than calamari. Neither of us ate it and it came with a full bed of rice which was way too much food. I think of calamari as a lightly fried appetizer.",

I ordered the grilled lemon chicken with cauliflower mash and veggies. So delicious! I also tried the coconut shrimp ceviche for an appetizer and that was awesome. Plenty of shrimp with a nice coconut milk dressing. And a little kick. For dessert, I tried the vanilla custard with fresh honey and fruit. I'm normally not a custard person since it can have that gelatinous quality (not a fan of flan, either), but this custard was very creamy and decadent. Lovely!  And to top it all off, we were all treated like royalty by our two servers, Jordan and trainee Elise (spelling?) . They were great, particularly Jordan as he answered questions and delivered items promptly and professionally. He was considerate and kind. He conveyed that he takes pride in what he does which is awesome.   Can't wait to return!",

Service was great and food was served fast. Prices are very reasonable. My friend ordered a Bloody Mary that was around $5. Good food, good experience :)",

Not sure of last time was just an off day for service and food or if we ordered the most awesomest things on the menu but everything was delicious. Service was excellent and the food ommmgg. Those au gratin potatoes were thee most amazing thing Ive had in weeks. So rich and creamy. Tasted like soul food mac & cheese except potatoes. The steak was cooker perfectly. The veggies were a lil too crunchy for my taste but still edible. Glad we decided to give them another try",

The main course sandwiches, bison burger and kids chicken nuggets were also well prepared.  The waitress was on point; pleasant, prompt and professional.

We both ordered margaritas pink grapefruit and hibiscus and decided on some food. My wife settled on the dirty dog with sweet potato tots   The hotdog is wrapped in bacon and covered with everything, even potato chips. A lot going on but she liked it. The toys come with jalapeno lime aioli for dipping. They were very tasty!  I had the lunch shrimp tacos. You get 2 full size soft shell tacos and a scoop of rice. The rice was unbelievably good. Normally when you go to a Mexican place the rice is dried out and blah but this rice was so tasty and fresh. Over shadowed the tacos!  The tacos were good, chock full of shrimp and slaw. I put the provided salsa on them and ate them!  The black beans were good too.  I ordered the little lunch cause they just started the new seasonal menu and had carrot cake that's gluten free so I had a pice if that. Was huge and I couldn't finish it. I ate all I could and the wife ate the frosting off the top LOL. I ordered coffee and the waitress made me a fresh pot. I appreciate that!  Good meal and would come back again!",

    "text": "I came here Saturday evening for a second round visit with my boyfriend and his parents. This time, we had a wonderful experience!  We had reservations, original arrival time at 5:00. We had to wait no more than 5 minutes to be seated at a booth table. Once seated, our wonderful waitress Maria came over to our table to provide us beverages. We selected the typical water, soda beverage options.   We didn't wait longer for our drinks, less than 5 minutes to arrive. Maria had provided my daughter a pack of coloring crayons and the kids menu to color.   Our party had ordered the following - S'Mores (Dessert) Extra Scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream (Sprinkles - Dessert) Pot Roast beef Dip Wedge Salad Alaskan Halibut Bacon Mac and Cheese Mini Corn Dogs Bacon Candy Garlic-Butter Flatiron Child Chicken Nuggets  The Appetizer, Hummus, came out immediately once we placed the order with Maria. The Hummus has a Spicy-Non Spicy Dip sauce, with the Spicy on-top and the pita surrounding it. The flavor profile was delicious between the mild/hot hummus dips.  Our entrees came out shortly after. I had a taste of the Bacon Candy, which was absolutely phenomenal! The Garlic-Butter Flatiron was cooked to the order preference I had selected, which was Medium-Well Done. The garlic butter was placed on-top of the Steak, melted. The sides that came with it, the potatoes au-gratin and the vegetables were good as well.   For Dessert, we topped it off with the S'Mores and Ice Cream! The S'Mores was delicious with the melted marsh-mellow on-top of the brownie. The ice cream scoop was on the side, so you could scoop out the S'Mores brownie and then mix it into the vanilla ice cream! Just delicious!   The service was absolutely phenomenal! The food was great!! I'll be back here again! The whole family left very happy! It was a great time!",

I'd say my experience was more with the happy hours though as I've had that food more then the meals itself.  With that said they have a nice selection of appetizers at tiered priced from $4 - $8.  The ones I've had before were tasty and filling. Great for sharing which I've done on a couple of occasions with friends or family.  Pet friendly patio, happy hour that is on the patio or in the bar only. (Patio is great has heaters as needed and a fire pit along with and abundance of seating)  Overall I like the place it is great for small plate items, a date night or out with a group on the patio.",

Since the corn chowder is seasonal I've been waiting awhile to try it, and it did not disappoint! It's warm and delicious and seriously tastes SO fresh. I definitely recommended trying it before it leaves the menu. I've also been wanting to try the crispy deviled eggs. I gave my 9 month old candied bacon off the first egg, and thought it was alright. But the next egg was excellent with the candied bacon on top. It really brings the dish together. Lastly, i had the small plate mac and cheese with hatch chiles and green onion crumble. It was my least favorite dish of the night though. Something about it just tasted off. But I will definitely be reordering the other two dishes the next time we go.",

Sometimes it can get a little crazy with 3 dogs but our server reassured us that they were acting great. Our server was Laura! She was amazing! We ended up staying a little later than we planned, but that was because it was slow and Laura spent some time with us chatting and getting to know us. Which in turn, we ended up ordering more food and drinks. She had my attention at Horses. We talked for awhile about different Horse breeds, saddles, and trails to enjoy. She mentioned one of her coworkers also loves horses too, and can't stop talking about horses. Haha! She was very attentive and the food was amazing! We ordered the hummus, Cajun fries, quesadilla, buffalo pops, chips, and nachos. Of course we had various drinks on the happy hour menu as well. We will be back for sure to enjoy the great food and specials!",

I, however, had a different experience. We ate outside and didn't bring dogs and it was nice watching everyone else with their dogs there. The service was great as well. I ordered a Wild Blueberry with Lemmon cocktail and sent it back. Normally I make due with the choices I make but this drink was all syrup and overwhelmingly sweet. I had the other people at my table taste it to make sure I wasn't being too particular and they agreed it was bad. The waitress was great in taking in back and getting me a different drink. I didn't ask but she removed it from the receipt as well. Second cocktail, a greyhound variety, much much better. I ordered the cheesy eggs and avocado toast with hashbrowns. When my plate arrived I was both perplexed and pleased. The toast looked amazing, the eggs ok, but the hashbrown was a balled up fist of the shredded potatoes thrown in the deep fryer. I took the first bite of the toast and it was great. The bread was slightly charred on top and it was chewy and crunchy. That was the last good taste. The second bite clued me in to the salt crust. The bottom of the toast had a salt crust on the entire bottom of it. I tried to scrape it off to salvage it but it didn't make much difference. The eggs were runny and an immediate turn off. I will not come here again nor will I recommend it to anyone. The dog feature it neat, that is all.",

We have sat inside and out on the patio and I have to say, the patio is my favorite. I am so glad the company has broadened outside of California and have made Downtown Summerlin their location in Las Vegas. We love to eat and then go shopping. I recommend the trio hummus and the chicken lettuce wraps and then the butter cake for dessert. I have brought my dogs a couple of times too. We always have a great time!",

We ended up going shopping at Downtown Summerlin so we go in early and they said I would still have to call, literally just step aside the host desk and call. I told them it would be for 7 and then they said they were only accommodating for 5. The hostess was condescending and kept tilting her head and smiling. I told them I spoke to someone yesterday and they said well things change, continuing to tilt her head. I do want to try the food because I have heard good things about the food, so hopefully my next experience will be better.",

I must have sat at the bar for 10 minutes before the bartender greeted me. Didn't catch her name but she was an Asian female. I asked her for a food & drink menu and she never bothered to come back over and take my order. Ridiculous. So I moved to a table hoping to get some service. My friends came, went spend about  $200 on food and drinks between the 4 of us. The food was blah (nachos, hummus, etc)... the drinks were waaaay watered down (we tried several different ones on the menu). Our waitress was ok, nothing special, nothing memorable. I just think there's so many other good places to go in this area with better food and service.  Big disappointment :(.",

This was a nice place to eat with friends and the NCAA Football National Championship was on that evening, so we could watch the game as well - lots of TVs.  I can't help but think the place is overpriced, though. You DO get large plates, but it's not really a place I'd go often. While everyone enjoyed their meal, I didn't see many menu options that seemed extra special. I would love to come back again when it's a little warmer and bring my dog. I hear the patio is nice for that and enjoying a drink with friends, although I've never done it.  I had the Hawaiian BBQ short ribs with fries and it was very tasty! Definitely try the chocolate lava cake-type dessert. We all shared a few desserts at the suggestion of our waiter and I'm glad we listened to him.",

Starter of Hush puppies, Humus Trio, and Cajun fries.... Yum!!   My meal this time Lamb Shank with mashed potatoes and a simple sauteed spinach... outstanding!  From here is just started to unravel from there. Son-in-law ordered the Buffalo Meatloaf... 45 mins later the manager is at our table telling us they are out. What!? My wife's meal tasted like it was marinated in vinegar for the day and then served. Pow! Wham! as you try to recover from our body shaking in revolt.  My Daughters Club was amateur at best and a complete disaster!  Now to get to the end of this rather disheartening evening... for the 3rd time the Manager Brooks shows up with me sitting at the table alone. \"I am so sorry for this evening\". she says, I responded, it just went south after the announcement of we are out of Buffalo meatloaf... Brooks agreed. I asked what I owed, without hesitation she responds, \"it is on the house with a deepest apologizes\". We were there for 1 1/2 hours with very little going right after starters, my meal was the exception.  I have to tell you, as I told Brooks, this is the only reason I would return and it is also the reason I gave a 5 star review. Period.  Thank you to a great Manager: Brooks. You are a gem among the stones out there in the world of Managers.  I am grateful.",

    "text": "To quote my husband, this place is basically \"a more expensive Applebee's.\" But with one big difference: It's dog friendly.  Although we did not have our dog with us, there were plenty of people with their pups on the patio. Looks like that would be a fun and novel dining experience. But, as we sat inside with the other dogless folks, I can only comment on the food, which was fine but nothing special.  I ordered lamb stroganoff with a wedge salad, because I make a mean lamb stroganoff and the spouse makes a killer wedge. I wanted to see how they did it here, and while it's always unfair to compare a restaurant's food with your own, I think they should have put \"Our take on ...\" in front of each of these menu items, because they were far from traditional. The wedge salad was lacking bacon, and instead of blue cheese dressing, there was a ranch-style dressing with blue cheese crumbles on top. The addition of tomatoes and onions was also unneeded and unnecessary. All in all, not a good start. The stroganoff was much better, although it was served on fettucine instead of egg noodles and there was a pronounced lack of sour cream. That said, the lamb was delicious, and I loved the mushrooms and peas (which I haven't used in my recipe, but maybe now I will!).  My husband had fish and chips, which is one of his standard orders. Their take on this dish was to mold the fish into burger-shaped patties and to give thin-cut fries instead of fat potato wedges. The fish was greasy, and the fries weren't very tasty. Another dud.  Service was a bit slow, but the place was packed so I can't fault our waitress. Although the menu items we selected weren't all that great, I would be willing to give Lazy Dog another try, maybe next time with pooch in tow!",

    "text": "Lazy Dog is in a great location, it has an amazing, comfortable and beautifully designed building. But let's start talking about what matters, their food. I have Lazy Dog 4 starts for a reason, obviously, so let me explain it for you in a feel lines.  Their food was good, their drinks were amazing, but I feel like they did not have many dishes in their menu that would justify 5 stars, for example:   -No truffle Fries -No File minion - no picanha   -No Sushi    So, with the competition around them, being around many trendy good restaurants at Downtown Summerlin, it pushes Lazy Dog to improve their menu. It's not just about having a 6 million dollars building with an expansive kitchen and good service, it's about food!  So, Lazy Dog is a very good option for large groups and very hungry and thirsty people. However, I feel like they would benefit from improving their menu a little bit. In addition, I feel like they should have an amazing hot dog there since the name of the place is Lazy Dog, but they dong!  Thus, Lazy Dog is a True 4 stars restaurant with great potential to reach 5 stars, like they are really, really close from getting that 5 stars from me. Just gotta add those truffle fries and a couple of options for sushi like a Temaki or a jalapenos yellowtail sashimi!",

It has something for everybody as well as fun, different combinations of foods that taste so good together!! The spaghetti and beet balls was so good!!! The last time I went was with my grandma, and we had exceptional service! Our server, Eric, was very polite and came to our table often to make sure we were enjoying our dinner experience. He had a great knowledge of the menu and helped us make our drink decisions. The manager on duty, Ursula, was so awesome to us. She took time out of her evening to sit down with my grandmother and I to have a conversation and make sure food and drink was up to par. She even gave us some amazing recommendations that did not disappoint! I will hands down continue to take friends and family here and ask for Eric as my server! And on top of that I get to enjoy his experience with my puppy!",

They do have anything from pastas, steaks, seafood, sandwiches, etc. I have been there when it has been cooler out so I have not been outside yet, but I have been told its very dog friendly. I will have to try it out in the warmer months. Also a tip don't forget to get your mints on the way out, they are neat and interesting :-). When I went the two times here one time I had their Caesar Salad and man it was a big salad for one person but it was very tasteful and filling. Sometimes its hard to find a good salad at restaurants. Then the second time I tried their steak and it was the tastiest steak I have had in along time. The seasoning was tasteful and the mashed potatoes and broccoli was very well cooked and it was very presentable also I would recommend this place even if you don't have a pet to bring they have fun atmosphere its worth the try out!",

    "text": "The atmosphere was sub-par we arrived late in the evening during the week and were seated promptly. Upon arrival, I observed a large number of large families and groups. We were seated in booth right across from the large groups which made the environment loud. The service was okay. The fiance ordered a cocktail and our server came back with the incorrect drink. The service is what heavily reflected on this rating. Took awhile to have my water refilled, fiances drink was never corrected and took an extended bit of time to receive our food. As for the food it lacked flavor. I choose a burger as I believed was impossible to mess up a burger. However, they managed to prove me wrong. The burger was dry, lacked flavor and was not filling. The dish wasn't presented well either, granted it's a burger, but presentation aside the food was lacking.   I highly doubt I will return here as I was not impressed. The restaurant had plenty of parking and was located on the northwest end of downtown summerlin. They were adding more stores near by (which have been completed by now at the time of this review) so that may affect the availability of parking if you choose to come early.  It was okay but I have been happier elsewhere.",

But at least here, and despite the name, dogs are restricted to the outside seating area.   Now for the restaurant:  The food is very good and fresh but the menu is less than extraordinary. To me, this is just another run of the mill sandwich and burger joint. But as one of those, it's a good one.   The service here definitely deserves a 5. I've eaten here a half dozen times and always felt like I could have stayed for hours. The staff is so kind and on top of things you just don't want to leave.   It's definitely worth your time and money to try this place. Who knows, maybe you'll score them a 4 or 5.",

My G-MA is sometimes hard to please just cause she's allergic to literally everything.  But she managed to take our requests with ease, Such a genuine personality.  She topped it off at the end when my G-MA asked for wipes since she enjoyed their BBQ ribs ! It was absolutely delicious btw.  She soon came back and said we were out of wipes but I brought back a damp cloth for you.   You can always make someone's experience good with genuine customer service!  She's a gem!

I called to give feedback on the veggie burger and maybe order something else and he didn't even apologize.

Service was friendly and prompt. Started with the Wok-Fired Calamari. It was delicious! Not traditional style. Tasted like Kung Pao over rice. Will order that every time.   We ordered brunch/lunch after that. The soups and salads were pretty standard. The burger was cooked perfectly as ordered and was very juicy. Seems like something they do well consistently. Also had the Country Chicken and Biscuits off of the brunch menu. It was hearty and savory. Great dish for a late breakfast.   Really enjoyed the experience overall. Draft selection was impressive for a restaurant. Will definitely sit on the patio again. Fans for the summer and fire pit for the winter.",

Menu is very extensive, they got everything to fit your current food cravings. From burgers, steak, chicken, fish, sandwiches, Asian inspired wok entrees and your grand salads. I would group them with Yard House and BJs. Prices are about the same too.   I ordered the Bahama Chicken-grilled chicken breast, grilled and topped with sweet sauce, served with brown rice, cilantro black beans, pickled cucumbers and topped with sesame seeds and cilantro.  Sounds like a pretty healthy dish. Erm, at least I would hope so. I portion controlled that so I wouldn't be packing on the calories plus I have leftovers the next day.  My friends both thought their entree choices were alright. Wasn't \"freakin delicious!\" but it wasn't \"disgusting\" either. They ordered a black n bleu burger with fries and an Asian inspired sweet and sour chicken bowl.  Food was a solid B+ but the service was terrible. Our waitress wasn't too attentive...seemed like she forgot about us for a second. We didn't care too much because my friends and I had a lot of catching up to do....but if you're pressed on time. Be aware of that. We came here for dinner on a Thursday night.  Great place if you're a dog mommy/daddy. You can eat with your pet outside the patio. They even have their own \"Pet Menu\" too. SO FREAKIN CUTE!!!!!! =)",

The food is definitely \"meh.\" I think you come here for the ambience, sitting in Summerlin, maybe with your dog, and certainly with your friends (a great group spot). Just get the solid happy hour foods, or a burger or some deep fried cheese. Don't think outside of the box. It's okay.",

They were outstanding! My wife had the wok fired teriyaki chicken which she loved and Gunnar was really impressed with the hand breaded chicken fingers!! Definitely the best chicken fingers I've seen in a long time! We all have leftovers to take home too! Jennifer R. Was our server and she was very pleasant as well as helpful. Very glad we chose to have lunch here today and most importantly we have a new favorite restaurant!!",

That was the mistake.  It seemed like there was only one server for the tables in the bar area.  Aside from being slow, she also didn't give us credit for the free appetizer we got from them via e-mail.  And after waiting so long to get our check, we weren't going to sit around for another half hour waiting to get it corrected.  If you go, do yourself a favor and get a real table.  Don't sit in the bar.  Not sure we'll be back.",

Had to wait 45 min due to a mistake on the restaurants part. However, once we were seated everything was great.   I ordered the Hawaiian sticky ribs. The manager Phil came over and apologized that they were taking so long. He stated that the plate was not made properly, and he wouldn't let it leave the kitchen. That is how you do it in the food industry... If its not right, don't send it out and apologize to your patrons.  All in all the management was great, and all of the food was great. They definitely redeemed themselves for this 5 star rating. I recommend this restaurant.",

Each and every employee we met was awesome, excited, professional yet personable. Drea (Andrea) behind the bar made a wonderful Lemon Drop and her food service skills were impeccable. We can't wait until we return with our friends to enjoy more of what Lazy Dog has to offer. The food was great and portions were large (almost too large on the pasta). The 2 managers I spoke with was excited to be a part of this opening. I took lots of notes as my son-in-law & daughter are opening a restaurant in Perth, Australia and the end of the month. Lazy Dog will be a place we frequent! Thank you for the comped evening & our tip reflected our pleasure! REMEMBER TO TIP FOLKS!",

Boneless chicken breast sauteed with sweet white corn, peppers and onions in a roasted poblano cream sauce, served with crispy tamale cakes, micro cilantro and Tapatio crema,  yum!

The only think I could possibly complain about was the 30 min wait but we showed up at 3:30pm on Mother's Day so no real surprise that there was a wait & once we got seated it was worth it. My friend and I brought our dogs & we were seated on the covered patio which was perfect as it was hot out & they had fans going to cool us off.   They brought water for the dogs quickly (oh yeah, water for us humans too) and pointed out the special menu they had for the dogs. Our dogs absolutely went to town on the chicken & rice so if they could type I'm sure their review would be good as well.   Our food was delicious and perfect, my friend was raving about the fish tacos as I was stuffing my face with the chicken club sandwich that they made as a wrap for me.   The service was just as good as the rest of it.  Our waiter (Brandon? I think? Sorry if you read this, I'm terrible with names) was great. Super friendly to both us humans and the dogs, brought more water when my dog rudely spilled his.   Price was great as well, lunch for 2 humans & 2 dogs came to under $30. I will definitely be back, probably later this week",

I feel bad I can't remember our waitress' name but she was so nice and when I complained that I wasn't a fan of the pasta I originally ordered she offered me a menu and let me reorder without hesitation and said I should not feel bad, some food isn't for everyone. For an appetizer we ordered the hummus which was AMAZING. For a drink I ordered the Strawberry Lemonade - not terrible but I've had better. Originally I ordered the Lemon Caper Pasta but as I said before - NOT A FAN. I replaced it with the Carbonara and WOW! Why didn't I order this in the first place? I asked myself! I will definitely return and next time I will hopefully have room for dessert.

The bartender was attentive and asked what I wanted to drink. I came for brunch and order coffee and the Mediterranean omelet. After having my coffee which I enjoyed the expediter comes out with my omelet and a cockroach starts running across at the bar at where I was sitting. I ask the expediter if he could see the cockroach in front of me. He acted oblivious at first to what I was asking him and then I pointed to the roach, he then grabbed the roach with a napkin. I told him I was leaving and refused to pay for anything and left in disgust. Ten minutes later I decided to call and speak to a manager about the incident. He told me from my understanding that they had tried to spray for roaches early in that day and had their monthly spraying from their exterminator. So then I asked him \"how long has this problem been going on?\" He assured me that they don't have a cockroach problem. I find that hard to believe. What I do believe is they have a roach problem. Either recently or for awhile now and refuse to admit to the issue. He then offered me a $25 gift certificate for my next visit. I told him \"thank you but on all honesty I would probably never eat at your restaurant at all.\" Besides writing this review I'm debating whether to call the Southern Nevada Health District. This place should be shut down until they can fix their infestation problem.",

Took another 1/2 hour to get a menu, 45 minutes to order drinks which I had to ask for again after my food was served to get.  Was there an 1 1/2 hours before getting the food which was okay but not worth returning for considering the terrible service.

I've been there once before and was t crazy about the food but figured since they have such a variety on the menu I'd give it another shot.  As we were looking over the menu options it said that most entrees come with a \"sidekick\".  The list of sidekicks were nowhere to be found on the menu.  When the waitress came by my father asked her where to find the sidekick list and she said \"they're in my book\" and walked away to help another table.  Ok, that doesn't help.  So she comes back and just hands my dad her book so he can read the options himself.  My mother, now putting on her reading glasses, read from the list also.  Isn't it the waitresses job to be helpful and courteous to her table? My father then asked what a \"Japanese cucumber salad\" was. Her reply was \"a cucumber salad with a fancy word in front of it\".  There was no further explanation.  Then she went on to talk bad about the company and how she doesn't like working there.  I gave it three stars because we actually all enjoyed our food that night but as for the service, I wasn't pleased.",

The pace of the meal was spot on and they are very up front about if you don't care for anything or want anything special they can accommodate.   We had the calamari..not your typical battered calamari and had a sweet and tangy sauce on it.  Different but I did enjoy it. For the entree I had the warm chicken on focaccia bread..loved it!  I tried some of my wifes pasta and fathers Chicken Parmesan.  If I had any gripe was that the food was a tad on the bland side.  Nothing a little seasoning couldn't fix. Overall it had a good vibe and a solid crowd.  Would love to sit on the psyio next time with my pooches.",

The place is clean, the service is fast and friendly and the drinks are strong. We arrive here and was promptly seated in the outdoor patio where they allow dogs to eat. The waiter and waitress, rot our drinks very fast and was nice to bring our dog some water that was ice cold. It was time to order our food, the dog was first up and then I ordered our food I have to say the food quality that the three different lazy dog restaurant we have been to has been outstanding.  There's not much we can say that we did not do here at this restaurant restaurant were very clean again the service was very fast and the patio is very cool and relaxing almost decided to take a nap with you highly recommend this location even with all the construction that was going on at the time of our life.

The environment makes you feel like you're at a huge Friday night party.  The portion sizes are hefty enough for two people to share one plate, so the prices are definitely justified. Servers are all over the place because its insanely busy, but none of them seemed like they'd rather die than be there. Jennifer R. was as attentive as the high speed environment would allow and sincerely friendly.  Jennifer and another server highly recommended the butter cake desert. For fans of sugar cookies, pound cake and ice cream, it's an amazing treasure. Pure joy on a plate!  Will definitely return. :)",

The butter cake is the stuff dreams are made of. We usually never order dessert, but it's worth it here for this cake. A wonderful blend of flavors, textures and temperatures. Try it! Food comes out pretty quickly (definitely fast enough for groups with small children) and, overall, service is attentive and friendly.

Sat there waiting for someone to help us with a few questions kept being told someone will be right with us. Some one new comes up and asks our order. While we wait for our food the manager comes and fills our glasses. It was nice to see such an active manager. Meanwhile there was 5 maybe 6 servers (still on the clock) hanging around a table of other servers that were either in their break or just clocking out and eating. The food was delicious. Took another 20 minutes of sitting with our plates empty before we could snag someone's attention to get our bill. Not particularly pleased but maybe it was just an off night.",

The staff seemed kind of indifferent about helping me, and they were slow. The food took a long time, too - over 20 min the first time.   The second time was MUCH worse - almost 40 min to get my food and 10 minutes before that to wait for the only person who can take an order for pick up. Even though there were 4 other people roaming around the hostess area, only one can take your order and they would not let me just order it at the bar, which was 100% empty.   The worst thing is not the wait - that is bad, but, you know, sometimes things go wrong. The worst thing was that when I finally had to go ask the (manager?) about my order and tell her it was over 35 minutes since I ordered it, she seemed annoyed by me. She did not apologize, or seem concerned at all. She didn't ask if there was anything she could do - could she offer me a coupon for 10% off next time? Nothing.   When I asked her why it took almost 40 min when I was told it would \"for sure be under 20 minutes\" she said that there were a couple of large take out orders that cam in right before mine. The restaurant, in general, was not busy at all. And, let's be honest. If they took 40 min to serve guests sitting at tables, no one would ever come back. So I guess it is just the take out side that is the problem. Either way, the food is not good enough to make me go back despite this kind of poor service.",

We were starving and started out with Passion Tea, Hummus Trio and Corn Wheels as appetizers.  Another waiter brought us homemade chips as a \"welcome\" gift.    (We also had our main meal:  Curry Tofu Bowl and Blue Cheese Burger, on hold in case we could eat more)....   We ended up cancelling the meals as we were stuffed with the three appetizers.  Amanda could have not been more delightful and had held the order back as per our \"eyes being bigger than our stomachs\"!!!  So we decided to try a dessert, Banana Pudding and a Butter Cake ....in the end, she wanted to buy the buttercake for us...it was the best darn cake I ever ate...  We know Lazy Dog from California, the owners used to own Mimi's and after they unloaded that yummy restaurant, they opened this amazing \"fusion type place of tastes\" over a decade or so ago.   The best service I have received in Las Vegas to date!!!!  Thank you!!!",

    "text": "There is a song by The Pirates Of The Mississippi called Feed Jake. Part of the songs lyrics reads as follows:  \"Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I die before I wake, feed Jake, he's been a good dog, My best friend right through it all, if I die before I wake, Feed Jake\"  Here's my suggestion, take Jake to The Lazy Dog.   My wife and I went, just the two of us for lunch, to see how good this restaurant is with our two daughters, and maybe even one of our four dogs.  From the moment we entered, we were impressed. The decor was interesting to look at. The staff was friendly.  The menu, I don't know where to start. The options were great as well. My wife, she ate a BBQ Ranch Bacon Cheeseburger with Cajun Fries. I opted for a Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich topped with onion strings and blue cheese coleslaw.   There is patio dining and if you care to, bring your four legged family member with you! I love this idea, we will return and when we do, one of our four dogs will come alone. Maybe the wife and I will bring the kids along too.  One complaint, after we ordered, I noticed \"ring stains\" from a cup or glass sitting on our table for too long. We arrived about 20 minutes after the restaurant  opened, so I am unsure how long the table had this \"ring stain\" on it, which leads me to wonder how long it had been since the table had been properly clean,  Who Let  The Dogs Out? Who cares? As long as the dogs were taken to The Lazy Dog for lunch!",

You will need to eat outside if you bring your dog, however they do have heaters during the winter, but not sure what they would do for our scorching hot Vegas summers.   The menu is pretty extensive and has lots of options. If your craving it, they most likely have it here. We stuck to brunch this time though cuz we went in the morning. I ordered a Coutry Fried Chicken over Biscuits. I think the portion was just perfect. Not too small where ur still hungry and not too big where u feel over stuffed and wasting food. The plate is served with a homemade biscuit split open over sauce, boneless fried chicken served over the biscuits and topped off with two sunny eggs. Delicious! My friend ordered the Blueberry Pancakes and they came with a BACON BUTTER with actual bacon pieces in it. Pancakes were nice and fluffy.  We each got an alcoholic drink. I got a Moscow Mule, which i believe on the menu it said it was only 160 calories. And my friend got a Mimosa.  Will definitely come back!",

I also love it because it doesn't taste processed or rushed. Looks and taste like it's made with love.  The ONE time that I do, Andres and Brooke, the manager went above and beyond to fix it and make it right. Honestly, the calamari alone would have brought me back eventually, but her and her team have made a customer for life.  If you're looking for a great meal that never disappoints and exceptional staff, come to Lazy Dog in Summerlin. They truly care about the customer, the happy Hour is awesome, the drinks are delicious and the food taste homemade.",

The menu is eclectic and it's a great spot for a big group since there seems to be something for everyone. The Kids Menu was equally great with several options that you don't normally see. There was edamame as an appetizer and Ruben's nephew enjoyed that!  Cajun Fries ($5.50): Really tasty fries. I love Cajun seasoning and these fries are just done right. This large serving is easily shared! I didn't like the Chipotle Ranch that comes with the appetizer. I'd request regular ranch dressing.  Wok-Fired Calamari ($10.75): Calamari strips tossed in sweet soy plum sauce; topped with peanuts, bell peppers, green onions, sesame seeds. We opted for brown rice (no additional charge). The calamari was okay, though I didn't care for the dish overall. The sauce that doused everything was grossly sweet and sticky. Not my type of \"Asian\" dish.  Chicken Poblano ($13.95): Chicken breast sauteed with sweet white corn, peppers, and onions in a roasted pobalno cream sauce, served with crispy tamale cakes, micro cilantro, and tapatio crema. This was really tasty. The chicken was nice and the sauces were flavorful. I really enjoyed the crispy tamale cakes! The dish was more spicy than I expected, so it was slightly difficult to eat (you should take the spicy icon on the menu seriously!).  I certainly enjoyed the food a lot more than I expected from this type of restaurant, but it's not a place I'd be clamoring to return.",

There are dogs of all shapes and sizes and some are less well behaved than others. Some owners are completely oblivious to what their dogs are doing. There was one big one climbing  on top of my kid and I had to yell at the dog to get down and the owner to watch their pet.  The food is better than your average chain restaurant, but still has a calculated, impersonal feel to it. The Tex-Mex salad was a standard, serviceable version. Hawaiian sticky ribs weren't as tender as I expected, but the Asian flavors delivered a powerful kick of tanginess and sweetness, served with fries covered with a spicy mayo sauce. The best item I've tried at Lazy Dog was the Carolina pulled pork sandwich. Served on a brioche bun, the combo of tender pork covered in a tangy BBQ sauce and the sharpness from bleu cheese was a winner in my book.",

We both love dark beer so she let us have a few samples. I ordered the Kung Pao tofu & my husband had the ahi burger. We also shared the veggies & hummus. They accidentally made me chicken, but quickly fixed it & brought out the tofu. Everything was delicious. There was a coconut stout on the menu we wanted to try but the bartender said they didn't have it yet, so maybe next time. Overall a great atmosphere, lots of drink options, and good food. We will return.",

The downfall unfortunately is the hostesses are young, inexperienced and it took me 20 minutes to make a reservation for my birthday , I had to call them back multiple times because I remained on the line for so long.  They tried to find a manager and couldn't . Also they have ONE song that plays over and over when your put on hold!! Finally when they said I had my reservation i relaxed until the day of when they didn't even have it when we arrived!! So after all that we had to wait for a table ! Then the next day they called and reminded me of my reservation for the night !! Talk about a headache!! Left a sour taste in my mouth which is unfortunate since I do enjoy the food :) try it out but don't try and make a reservation ... Save yourself the trouble!",

Awesome sandwich on banquette with mozzarella, onions and horseradish sauce. Very flavorful, tender, shredded pot roast. Dip it in the au jus and you are off to the races. Fries are great too.",

The fiance always gets the pot roast while I usually get the hawaiian sticky ribs or the bbq ribs. We have also tried the fish &  chips that I enjoyed and as for dessert we always have to have the strawberry butter cake!!!! Melt in your mouth deliciousness! What's nice about this place is they have a gluten free menu upon request as well as a menu for the furry babies!! And the doggies are only allowed out on the patio but that's perfectly alright because they've got other friends to keep them company. We'll be back!",

Having Asian chicken and carne asada is the way to go.     Save room for dessert because the brownie was decadent!

There were lots of doggy diners...looked to me like they served them bowls of water and brown rice. How cute!   I'm not familiar with the lazy dog chain...apparently there are 15 in California. It's a very family friendly, bustling, tasty, affordable restaurant.   During my 2 visits thus far, I've had the sausage mushroom bisque, hatch chile and bacon Mac and cheese, loaded baked potato hush puppies, poblano chicken, hummus and chicken salad, rhubarb crumble, Jamaican lemonade, and cucumber thyme lemonade. The lemonades are fun and not too sweet at all which I love! The Jamaican lemonade comes with a fun little squeezer of coconut milk. Both are served with a trendy chevron straw. The bisque is absolutely delicious. Creamy and scrumptious. A bowl is huge. Easily enough for a meal. The poblano chicken was packed with flavor. It is served with corn cakes and loads of peppers and onions. The Mac and cheese was tasty but salty; very cheesy. The hummus chicken salad was a conundrum. A very eclectic mix of ingredients. The salad part was disappointing. Cheap wilty shredded lettuce. The grilled chicken with walnut pesto part was delicious. Moist and flavorful. The sun dried tomato hummus and pita were yummy too. All these things combined with balsamic and tomatoes- just so strange. The rhubarb crumble was absolutely delicious and massive! It could easily feed 4 people. Warm, gooey, tart and divine.   The bill was shockingly low each time. Very affordable and they do a fine job. Service was great on both occasions. Attentive, sincere, outgoing. I'll go again for sure....maybe again this week!",

My husband usually always orders the Baja California burger with onion rings and no complaints ever!  Best onion rings!    I've had the cheese burger which I order \"no pink\" so sometimes a little dry which I guess is my fault. The Roasted Chicken Havarti sandwich is delicious!  The chicken is so flavorful and never dry. I love balsamic so I ask for an extra side of it. Their sweet potatoes tots are well worth the upgrade charge!    Kids have had the teriyaki bowl, fettuccine Alfredo and burgers and always delicious.   My new favorite dish is the Grilled Salmon Sandwich!  So so good!  The 1st time I ordered I forgot to take a picture until the end... so the empty plate says it all. It was so good and that was all I would talk about so the next day he surprised me with the sandwich to go at home for dinner... the picture of 1/2 the sandwich just doesn't do it justice!",

My wife and I ordered the two house IPAs - she the \"Huckleberry Haze\", and I the \"Liquid Blanket\" - and both were quite good.  Given that it was around 1 on a Saturday, we thought we'd need to stick to the lunch menu, but to our delight brunch was served until 2. Knowing that, my wife ordered the Carnitas and Tater Tot Hash, while I ordered the Breakfast Club. Both were delicious and decadent - in a \"what happens in Vegas\" way.  I would normally rate the Lazy Dog four stars given that it's not exactly haute cuisine, but the combination of tasty comfort food, excellent beer, superior service and a dog-friendly vibe earns it an extra star.",

    "text": "Such a cute place! My dog enjoys the chicken and rice and I usually get the ahi tuna salad. The food here is great, but the service is horrendous.  Every time I am here it takes a while for the drinks and food to arrive.  The only reason I come here is because it's great for my dog to be outside and hang out with us and enjoy himself.  Today was probably the worst feeling.  The lady who sat us (holding an iPad) was very mean/rude.  She calls out my name and she starts walking us to our table and we notice other tables around were empty, but she's walking us over to a sunny table.  I ask, \"is it okay if we grab that table in the shade\". She looked annoyed and said \"sure\".  After we sat down she rudely said \"you know, next time you want a shady table you have to request it, people are crazy when it comes to the sunny tables\". Excuse me, but did you just call me crazy for not wanting a sunny table? She didn't jokingly say it, she was serious.  The food here really doesn't match the service. 5 stars for food, but -1 stars for service and customer service.   Honestly, she could of just sat us without adding everything else she said to us while seating us.  (Old review was 5 stars because I believe it's been getting worse and worse and worse as time goes by)",

My crusted ahi tuna plate contained a huge piece of plastic, presumably what the mashed potatoes were encased in... the server's suggestion was I have the dish remade. I wasn't interested. She had the dish taken off my bill, which was fine, but I'd think that a faux pas of this caliber would merit a manager stopping by to apologize for the mishap. Nowhere in sight. Should have stuck to the Lazy Dog at Town Square.",

Very pleasant ambiance, best part you can bring your pets!  My husband ordered the soy glazed salmon which was great, I had the queso dip and bowl of tomato soup. Both were excellent. Soup was served perfectly hot, which I really appreciate. I don't like when soup is served warm.  Very reasonably priced drinks, we had a bottle of bubbly for $20!  Service was ok, some minor ordering issues, which were promptly corrected and an unclean wine glass, other than that everything was great. Our server was very pleasant.  kids menu is great, they have all the kids favorites cheeseburger, hotdogs, pizza, pasta, drink and side included, my boys wiped their plates clean.  Would def recommend for a causal family dinner night.",

My boyfriend's mom and I came here for a bite to eat with my little man, Logan. The wait was about 30 mins which wasn't bad for a Friday night. We lucked out and the weather on the patio was perfect. The only downside to being on the patio is how crowded it can be once all the dogs are out there.   For food this time around I had the ahi tuna sandwich. It wasn't the best I ever had, but still tasty. 3/5 I did like the option of a watermelon slice as a side though because I love watermelon. My bf's mom had the nachos which looked awesome and were HUGE! Unfortunately I didn't try any though. To accompany my meal I did have the sangria sample which I thought was excellent. 5/5  I love this place for casual dinners and will definitely need to give brunch a try for next time!",

I thought I was in a kennel. There was a minimum of 15 dogs in that small space barking at certain times. Big and small. The person that I was with is allergic and suffered through the entire meal. It is a shame that you can't enjoy the outside atmosphere in Vegas when it is nice without having to eat with the dogs. They should at least warn you before seating you.  The food is good but it still seems like a health hazard to me even though it's outside.",

Two burgers, a pot pie, bowl of corn chowder, and a kid's chicken teriyaki later, our appetites were fulfilled and cravings satisfied. We ended the night with the Butter Cake dessert, a butter cake with vanilla bean ice cream, mint glazed strawberries, garnished with basil. To. Die. For. We will definitely be back, maybe with our pooch (seeing as how dogs are welcome on the patio seating).",

There wasn't anything special about their all American cheeseburger. It was basically a regular cheeseburger on fancy brioche bread. The Cajun fries had flavor, but it seemed a little stale. You really had to bite into the fries to consume it. Not really a fan of their strawberry lemonade as well. I had to switch to a Sprite.  However, The roast beef dip sandwich was to die for. The aju sauce was on point. My girlfriend almost died eating it, it was that good.  On the down side, the hostesses there were rude. It was our first time there, and they looked at us like we were idiots. We asked them 3 questions for about a couple minutes, standing aimlessly in the lobby, and they didn't answer is AT ALL. Finally when they gave us the time of day, they didn't even answer the questions we initially asked.  Despite the fact, I'd give them another shot. I absolutely love that it was a dog friendly establishment. I'd like to try them during happy hour :)",

An added bonus is the people around you are also raising their voices because the music is so LOUD. So you get to hear all the conversations around you. On blast.  When I asked the hostess who gave us our table if the music is always this loud she responded with, \"pardon me\" and moved closer to hear my question. She shared she doesn't have any control over the sound system.  So if a loud restaurant environment is something you enjoy, you may love the Lazy Dog.",

Please note *animal cuteness overload!!*        It happened to be durning happy hour and there were a lot of really good items on the menu. For drinks, we settled on the dark horse Cabernet (great value on happy hour $4) and a pitcher of sangria ($15). Our friends ordered shots of Jameson. We requested our food be prepared vegan. We ordered the edamame, stir fry tofu and veggies, hummus trio, and Caramelized Brussell sprouts. Our friends ordered the ahi poke and chicken lettuce wraps. I received my drink pretty promptly. However, the shots and the sangria... Took over 15 min to come out. They hit the table with the edamame. The edamame... Now I love salty food... But this... It wasn't edible... Overly salted.  We actually sent it back:(.        The manager came out and let us know that The tofu is bathed in egg, but the Brussel sprouts could definitely be done with no butter and made vegan yay!!! We wound up canceling the stir fry and getting the veggie lavash with no cheese. Highly recommend. As the food was coming out, we noticed we were missing a few items and just thought it was taking a while. Well... A while turned into the end of our meal. We couldn't tell anyone because no one came back to check on the table. The server, although very sweet, seemed a little overwhelmed. There was an incident with an ambulance and a diner right next to us. Perhaps that threw him off his game a little bit. By the time we were able to tell him about the food, we were pretty much ready to go. Apparently the manager never communicated to him that the sprouts could be prepared vegan, so the order was never inputted and the hummus... I'm not sure exactly what happened to it. Not entirely his fault by any means.       Our experience here was unfortunately underwhelming. I'll probably be back for happy hour in the future... After they get it together a little more.",

She made it up by comping my meal which was very nice of her.  The second time I came here was during Halloween.  It wasn't too busy at all and there were only a few tables seated out on the patio.  It took a while for a server to even come to the table to get our drink orders in.  I'm a huge fan of Ballast Point so it was nice to see they had the Calico Amber Ale on draft.  They have a great selection on beers.  Our food once again took quite a bit of time to come out.  The fish and chips were so good when they came out.  The batter was so light and the tartar sauce was delicious.  I want to like this place more but the slow service twice in a row is disappointing.",

For a place supposedly catering to dogs I found it just the opposite. While waiting outside for our table on the patio there are no poop bag dispensers and no place to put it after you pick up after your dog. People that had brought bags were just leaving them in the planters as opposed to bringing it into restaurant. Once inside the only place for your dog was to tie it to your chair. Not cool at all as other dogs coming in were too close. Waitress did bring a small bowl of water to table for dog which was nice. Food was mediocre but desert was ok. Concept needs a lot of improvement before I return. Waitress was nice but out of an item we ordered for desert and dinner hour was just beginning at 5 PM!!! Do not let the 5 star reviews fool you if you are a dog owner; probably written by staff and owners...",

Portion sizes for the price are not that great(2) service was pretty standard (3) value: hard to justify coming back when there are better tasting restaurants nearby for way better price point. (2)  Went in for a quick lunch on a weekday and came away disappointed.  Just FYI -  this joint is highly popular with the Summerlin crowd.   I ordered the chicken pesto salad which came with a little scoop of sun dried tomato hummus and two miniscule slices of flathead. The grilled chicken had that rubbery texture and was rather pale color with some grill marks on it. It definitely was not tasty. Worse yet was the super odd pesto it was slathered in. The hummus was completely bland. To be honest,  I prefer the Sabra's (yeah! the listeria laced hummus brand) over the the hummus I tried here.  The marinated tomatoes were unpleasantly sour and mealy while the portion of greens was rather small. Meh,  definitely had better.  The hubs ordered the fish tacos which sucked. He only got two tacos which featured dry bland mahi mahi. The pico de gallo was tasteless. It was served with rice and beans.  The hubs thought the beans tasted straight out from a can. He'd rather hit Rubio's.   Service was solid and quick. We were tempted to send stuff back but we were in a rush and didn't want to bother. Instead we went home so I could wash the horrible aftertaste of the pesto from my mouth.   It's hard to justify coming back here when the food isn't even good. Portion sizes for the price are also not that great but then again,  do you really want more of a bad thing? Avoid this joint like the plague (2 starred review)",

I've only eaten at LD a handful of times but so far the best waitress I've experienced was Daria at the Summerlin location. She was on point in bringing out orders on time, bringing extra bread for our hummus trio without question or added charge & had a fantastic attitude.   I may be a little bougie preferring the more intimate dining experience with a menu that skirts outside the norm but I'd never say no to a meal at the Lazy Dog. Oh, and the new Chile Verde Nachos....perfectly chased down with a glass of house Chardonnay (or beer).",

The cajun fries were ok, I kind of expected more mentally but they were still good...don't get me wrong. The just had a bacon cheeseburger this time around but it was really good. The burger itself was perfectly prepared and seasoned. I will definitely be returning. I thought the whole setup was really nice and fitting for any kind of outing.",

I think this was a fluke but my review is for the manager and customer service.  The manager gave us a free steak AND our steak for free along with some appetizer coupons!  We told him it was fine and he insisted!  Now that is customer service and we will be back!  Gisselle, our waitress was also Very accommodating!!!  Even had them turn down the air when she saw I was cold.  I love having people \"pay attention\" and take care of their customers!  Thank you Lazy Dog Restaurant!",

It came out with one patty.  Instead of apologizing, some assistant manager endlessly insisted that the All American only has one patty.  Read the freaking menu- the word \"Two\" is the very first word in the description.  Oh but there is more.  I ordered wings.  I'm still waiting for them.  Lazy Dog gave me a final bill but not an itemized statement.  You can guess what happened next.  When we requested the itemized statement, we were billed for the wings.  The bartender said, \"oh, you never got the wings?\"    I guess the wings are with the missing veggie patty.",

    "text": "The experience here can be summed up in one word.... HORRIBLE!! The service staff left us feeling like we were a bother to their day. Very uncomfortable atmosphere.   From start to finish this place was a disaster. Our \"server\" was so bizarre. When she finally came over to our table she never introduced herself so we never knew her name. She took our drink order then returned about 15 mins later to take our food order by saying \"do you know what you want?\" Never offered specials/recommendations or asked if we had any questions about the menu.   Long story short, our side salads came out(which was wrong) then 5 mins later our appetizers came out then 1 min later our entrees came out. So basically our burgers were cold by the time we were ready to eat them.   Our waitress was aware that she was struggling to stay afloat, but kept laughing and joking about it. There was nothing funny about it.   I would never come back or recommend this place to anyone. There are soooooo many other options to eat in a 1 mile radius. My advice is to avoid this place altogether. Don't say you weren't warned.   P.S. After reading other reviews this seems to be a on-going issue with the service staff. So obviously \"management\" does not value your feedback...  Such a bizarre operation.  See below: Cookie cutter corporate response. No thanks.",

    "text": "The three of us went here for the first time on Sunday 6/28.2015. I am giving three stars because the service was slow, the restaurant was insanely loud, and the food is good but not outstanding in any way. As far as service was concerned, this was half be served experience and half serve yourself. There were sharing plates on the table which I like because it makes one less thing for a server to forget. Sadly though, we did not have any utensils. My dad had to get up and walk to a bus station to grab some. They were busy so no biggie... But we also had to help ourselves to pepper. (hence the serve yourself comment)  We all ordered an alcoholic drink. I had the sangria sampler...not worth ever ordering a glass. They were all boring. The presentation was cute though. We had the lettuce wraps as an appetizer and they were excellent. We each ordered an entree. One burrito bowl, one lunch soup and sandwhich, and I had the fish and chips. The fish and chips were actually really really good. Super crispy and flavorful. The other two, lackluster. Lastly we had the peach crumble dessert. It was okay. Nothing special and it took forever to get to our table.   Bottom line about the Lazy Dog is: it comparable to a BJs restaurant. The service isn't great. Don't go here to have an intimate conversation. It is good for groups and families. I am glad I went and tried it but I don't see myself chomping at the bit to go back.",

It is always something that goes sideways with this place. It's either bad inattentive service or the kitchen is backed up and takes 45 minutes to get a turkey burger. Staff seems pleasant but I never see the same faces so turnover is more than likely pretty high. It just does not have any personality it's too bad, but if you visit here you will know what I' saying right away. So I'm done with Lazy Dog, I feel I gave the restaurant a Legit shot at making it good. But they just don't pay attention enough to know where they are falling short. Or maybe worse they don't care",

The service is always friendly and tolerant of those dogs whom are not the best behaved, which itself demonstrates great patience on their part. The menu is largely quite good, though a bit too long diverse to really focus on excellence. Nevertheless it is a relaxing, quality place in a very unfriendly city for dog owners.",

They pickle Cucumbers and radishes and serve it in a mason jar with a side of the wonton \"chips\". The house brews were really good as well. This place is perfect for just sitting at the bar or getting a table and taking the family. The outdoor patio area allows people to take their dogs and they even offer a small dog menu!! Fun place for sure.",

Totally worth a longer drive. I thought it was gonna be like a basic Red Robin kind of thing, but the food and service was just super all-around amazing.  We ordered two minutes before happy hour ended, and our server (Ronnie) was a freakin champ about helping us slide in with our orders before it ended. I was way impressed with her the whole night.  BBQ Bison Meatloaf was pretty much the best meatloaf I've ever had. The beer selection was great. We had these roasted carrots for an appetizer, no idea how they made carrots taste so good. Just...way to go.   So, thank you Ronnie! Thank you Kristin for hiring good people and keeping a good floor of a restaurant. (she was the manager we chatted with for a bit.) Definitely want to spread the word about this place.",

    "text": "This used to be one of our favorite places to go.  Dog friendly patio, do menu, good food decent beer selection and good prices.  Unfortunately, the last few times we stopped in for dinner we had issues being seated.  We also keep getting the same waiter who clearly doesn't stay focused on waiting tables.  Regarding patio seating - when we first started going here the entire outer patio was reserved for people with dogs, allowing you to tie your dog to their railing.  Then they changed and only allowed dogs on the far end of the patio, including in the middle of the patio.  This time, we were told that there are only a small number of dog friendly tables on the patio and they they are all near the entrance.  This means that our dogs are distracted by the people waiting for a table, children running around outside and other dogs waiting with their people.  Thankfully our dogs are well behaved, but multiple children ran up to our dogs and stuck their hands through the railing to pet them.  When we inquired as to why the dog seating had changed, we were told that too many people were complaining about dogs on the patio and they reduced the number of dog tables in order to accommodate the other guests.  This restaurant is called Lazy Dog, they offer a dog menu and there are multiple signs indicating that there will be dogs at the restaurant.  If you are offended by dogs or allergic to dogs, perhaps you should either eat somewhere else or eat inside where there are no dogs.  Despite really liking this place, I'm not sure if I'll be back.  There has to be other dog friendly dining options in Las Vegas.",

I wasn't super hungry so I ordered a bowl of tortilla soup, and the soup was meh. This would be five stars if I hadn't had GIANT hunks of chicken in the \"soup\" there wasn't much broth and there was giant pieces of chicken that no one could eat in one spoonful which negates the point of a soup.  Everyone else loved their orders, and the service was great. Just didn't like the soup, I'd pass ordering that again. Also, they were out of almost every beer we tried to order which wasn't fun. But, I will be back and try their other options soon. :)",

Went here for dinner, for my friend's dog's birthday.. we had a \"bark-day paw-ty\" at the Lazy Dog! It wad really nice how accommodating the staff was for the celebration. You can order a bowl of beef or chicken with rice for the dogs. Seating with your pet is outdoors. Because it was dinner, the weather was nice sitting outside, not too hot in Sept.  Had the Campfire Pot Roast & Ceviche Tostadas.. both were so good! The Pot Roast was tender, the meat just fell apart easily & it meshed well with the spinach & mashed potato. The ceviche was fresh & light, a good appetizer - 3 tostadas an order.  I hear the other locations have great tasting food & service. For this being my first time, it was definitely a nice experience. Planning on going back to try their Brunch menu.",

I would have messaged the business but I do not see the opportunity to message the business privately, which I prefer to posting a 2 star review. I understand any restaurant or business can have a bumpy day or night!   I like this concept and enjoy Lazy Dog... But in the future, I will choose not to wait indefinitely for a table when everyone is hungry and we have brought our dogs:(    I called in advance to make a reservation and was told that they take reservations 24 hours in advance, for parties of 7 or more. The person on the phone told me they were always busy and there is always a wait.  I did not love the response, but our friends really wanted to bring their dogs so we happily went.  Our group was told it was about a 20 minute wait... We sat and waited patiently on the patio with our party of 4 people and 3 doggies.  No offer of water or a beverage while we waited, for humans or doggies  At 45 minutes we were told we were 2nd on the list.  At one hour we were still number 2 on the list. We were hungry and wanting to know how much longer it would likely be.  We were told some parties had been at the tables on the patio for Over 4 Hours and they had No Idea when we would get a table:(   We discussed the situation and no one wanted to wait on the stone benches any longer...   We left and walked next door to another restaurant's patio, sat down immediately and enjoyed a Fabulous meal on the neighbor restaurant's patio.  They welcomed us and our dogs.  See Spot Run next door",

The strawberry compote tasted just like the strawberry sauce my Mom put on pound cake growing up. It was amazing. My husband loved his brownie as well but we will definitely share a dessert next time.

It was messy but full of flavor and had a small kick to it from the buffalo sauce. Their portion size vs. price was right on point. Better service would make this place 5 stars for sure!",

When we walked in the hostess was quick to greet us with a smile and directed us to the bar as we requested.  Once sitting at the bar Roy and Brandon were prompt to greet us and get drinks started. From start to finish their service was awesome! They held good conversations with us making it a 1 of a kind experience.  Food: we ordered the lettuce wraps to start which were tasty and lite so we were not too full for our lunch. The cheese and basil pizza perfect size to split and had great flavor.  Drinks: originally I ordered the Michelada, which was ok, the flavors just weren't hitting me right I guess. They happily swapped me out for the coconut mojito which was amazing! It's light and refreshing!  Throughout our lunch there were multiple managers that came and checked on us which was really nice! Jason and Jake both were very friendly and professional.   Overall really great experience, I will definitely be returning.",

I counted three pieces of chicken.    It was sad.  My wife ordered soup and a sandwich...easy right?  yet the Chicken tortilla soup had chewy rubbery tortillas, soup out of a can and old tortillas, so on to her grilled cheese... should one side be hard and the other soggy?  Nope... ugh ...  terrible.  maybe the food is better fit for the dogs who were supposed to be outside but people were bringing them inside.  Can you say Health Inspector?",

We normally bring our golden retriever and sit on the patio but we have also sat inside and at the bar as well. My wife almost always gets the same two menu items, depending on it being brunch or dinner, but I have tried something different every time we have been. We have yet to have a bad meal or service. We most recently went for Easter Sunday, 04-16-17, and were the first customers on the patio at 830am. As we were getting our child out of the back seat, our playful golden retriever got loose in the parking lot and ran over to a Lazy Dog worker who looked like he was bringing coffees in for his coworkers. He was great with our dog and greeted us as well. The host person sat us at our patio table and our server ended up being the same person we met in the parking lot! His name was Timijen and he was fantastic. My wife had the brunch berry pancake, our son had buttermilk bone cakes, I had the Mediterranean omelet, and our pup had some scrambled eggs. The prices for the quality of food are excellent and we look forward to seeing Tim and the rest of the Lazy Dog staff at the Downtown Summerlin location again.",

    "text": "The Lazy Dog is a quaint little restaurant with the ambiance of being away in the mountains, surrounded by log cabins. We sat outside around a huge fire pit with an open ceiling. The coolest perk: Dogs are welcomed! Hence the name. The Lazy Dog has a good menu selection for people and a cute little section for the pups. The coffee was spot on, delicious & unlimited. The food, even though simple i.e. fish & chips, turkey sandwich, buffalo wings, were all presented and plated quite elegantly. I highly recommend this restaurant. Sit outside and enjoy the fresh air, surround yourself with a warm fire & good food!",

I did see a lot of seating though, so maybe it was just a server issue. We got our orders taken fairly quickly and our meals in about 15 to 20 minutes. Everything was hot. The food was pretty good, I wouldn't call it the best cheeseburger I've ever had, but then again it is just a cheeseburger.   I like that their menu is so large, I feel like there is something here for everyone if you bring a big group of people with varied tastes. There's even a low calorie section, which is nice for people who are watching what they eat. Also, you can find nutritional information via their website.  The most delicious thing here though are the sweet potato tater tots. How my I almost 30 and have now just had these? Like, seriously. Yumtastic. I need to see if they sell these frozen at my nearest grocery store!",

We made a last minute switch from where we were going and they were able to accommodate us without having to wait forever and gave us one long table which worked out great. Our waiter, Gerardo was amazing. We asked for separate checks and he said no problem. He was methodical with our orders and everything came out perfectly and didn't take as long as I thought it would have. The food was also excellent. I think everyone liked what they got. A lot of people got burgers which looked fantastic. I ordered Chicken Parmesan which was delicious. They have 2 sizes of this so I ordered the larger size so I could have leftovers for another meal. The portion they gave me was more than enough for 2 meals! I will make it a point to come here again. Oh, and the menu was huge. Prepare to study it, or better yet, look at it online before you go. That way you don't have to take so much time deciding what you want.",

    "text": "Lazy Dog is one of the many  dining options in Downtown Summerlin. I had a turkey burger on my first visit, and it was delicious. The bun was toasted perfectly and the patty was seasoned in such a way that I didn't miss the beef at all. The strawberry citrus soda is light and refreshing. Brunch time here is busy and noisy, so anticipate that.   On a more recent visit, I ordered the carbonara. The menu says there is supposed to be a poached egg on it, but I opted to have it without. The pasta was good but I think the cook was pretty heavy-handed with the salt. The Chardonnay cream sauce was nearly drowned out by the saltiness. I hope that it was a fluke, because I would be willing to give it another shot. Try the Jamaican Lemonade...it's the perfect refreshment for a sunny afternoon.   Their food and drink menu is huge, so I'll be back to try something new the next time I'm around.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Lazy Dog and I am impressed! From the moment we walked up to this beautiful clean modern building to the last delicious bite, I like Lazy Dog for several other reasons.  First they are Dog friendly and provide an enclosed shaded patio for Fido.  Your fur baby even gets his/her own bowl for water and there are some menu items that are pet friendly like the brown rice and chicken.  Our server Daniel greeted us promptly and provided suggestions based on our questions.  I enjoyed the soy glazed salmon with veggies and brown rice my company went for the trout with veggies.  Since I like beer I had to try a flight of this microbreweries best not so hoppy offerings. I fell in love with the Hefe. My hats off to the brewmaster for blending a honey toned hefe that is now amongst my favorite. The blonde and the stout came in for silver and bronze respectively. I cant forget to mention that we started our meal with the Hummus trio, which was delicious. But dessert was the icing on the cake pun intended.  We had the butter cake and it was worth every calorie that now I have to work off.  For a Monday afternoon the place was steady. The environment from the music to the sports on the televisions, to the great menu and bar selections mean that I will return and highly suggest you give this place a try.",

This is the best restaurant of with wait service tableside that allows dogs. We consistently get great service and are never disappointed with the food quality.  When you're seated, alongside the people menus they also include a dog menu. you can choose from a hamburger patty or grilled chicken over brown or white rice. Each dog gets their own complimentary bowl of water. We have ordered both the hamburger patty and grilled chicken with brown rice. Buddy the dog seems to like both alot as he can finish his food here in 60 seconds flat.   As for the people food...  They redesigned their menu a few months ago, and since then the quality of the food has been excellent. It seems they prep most of their recipes from scratch at the location and you can tell the difference with the freshness of the vegetables and subtle tastes like garlic and citrus zest.  As a vegetarian, I order the Tofu Coconut Curry bowl.  It is REALLY good.  The tofu is breaded and cooked perfectly. Flavors are excellent. And all for 9.75, you can't go wrong for what you get.  I highly recommend it.  For dessert, many times we can't turn down the Butter Cake. It's served warm with cold vanilla ice cream and berries... it is delicious!! Get it when you go.",

The staff is friendly and pleasant as well as efficient. I love the chicken tortilla soup. I think some of the entrees should be larger portions. Wish they had the NFL package though so we could watch more football there but it's not a sports bar so I get it (but they do show some sports). I love Lazy Dog!",

It's pretty cool to see customers with their dogs.  They're also allowed to dine inside!   I deducted one star just for service because I felt like our server wasn't sincere and seemed uninterested in holding a convo (his vibe was off like he was just there to make his money).   Food was great and came out quick. The drinks were awesome and I'd definitely order the Pineapple Mojito again. It wasn't a memorable place but I'd go here again if I happened to be shopping in Downtown Summerlin.",

    "text": "After a hike in Red Rock and needing to meet other family members for dinner, we decided on Lazy Dog. Everyone in our party of seven was satisfied with their food and we had an enjoyable meal. The casual atmosphere allowed everyone to relax and the large menu provided something to the liking for everyone in the group.  Arriving at 6:30 on Saturday night, we were first quoted a 45 minute wait. But when we denied the offer to wait, the hostess stopped us and offered us the long community table in the bar, which we accepted. Even though we were seated in chairs without back support we had plenty of elbow room. Service throughout the meal was excellent and they tackled our party without issue during a very busy dinner. Our server was quite friendly guiding us through the menu and the kitchen was efficient and there were no significant waits for anything.  The restaurant with the Rocky Mountain lodge decor and atmosphere has a large menu covering almost every cuisine. There was something for everyone in the group. I had the sticky ribs which were flash fried baby backs brushed with a molasses barbecue sauce. Your primary concern is that they \"flash\" fry the ribs opposed to deep frying them into leather. They did a good job as the ribs were fried perfectly with a crunchy outside and with moist, tender meat on the inside. I don't know if umami is an accurate descriptor of the fries, but they were still delicious. The portion did not completely fill me and I had plenty of room for dessert.  Also ordered were the chicken chile verde nachos, fettucine alfredo with chicken, chicken parmesan, house club, ginger soy salmon, carbonara, and the sesame crusted ahi. For dessert, the salted caramel creme brulee, butter cake,and white chocolate chip brownie. The nachos were full of toppings and did not last long on the table. The pasta weren't anything special, but sufficient for my daughter and her friend. The butter cake and brownie were absolutely devoured. I would recommend those two for sure if you have room. After we finished, the $$ price point for the entire meal was completely accurate.  Lazy Dog does a lot of things with their menu, but nothing is really outstanding. We did like the atmosphere and the family got to spend quality time together. Because the menu is so large, I wouldn't give up on them if you don't find something your first time around. Happy hour might be an ideal time to sample the menu because they offer a wide variety of food and drinks at very reasonable prices. I would have no problems stopping in for happy hour or for another meal.",

If you want to meet a girl, bring a puppy to the outdoor patio and wait no more than a minute or two before you meet 10 new people. Or, if you want to just meet other dog owners in general. But seriously, Lazy Dog is a dog and dog owners' heaven. There's a sign forewarning that if you're not canine-friendly, then you should probably sit indoors. But sitting outside was really fun seeing all types of furry friends out and about.   As for the food, the menu is huge and it really got to the point where I had no idea what to order. It did remind me of a dog-friendly version of Cheesecake Factory with its choice of pastas, salads, and sandwiches. I ended up sticking with the carbonara, which came with a generous helping of bacon, romano, and a perfectly poached egg on top.   Some of the smaller plates attempt to make healthy items taste better with some fat and grease, include the buffalo cauliflower and sweet potato tater tots with roasted jalapeno-lime aioli. Or you could just not care about what you're eating and just go for the mac & cheese, which features 5 cheeses with bacon topped with a green onion crumble (slightly healthy?).   The food was decent, but you really come for the atmosphere, which is a perfect place to take all dogs on a carefree day.",

The waitress Leisa was really nice and friendly, she checked on us often and made sure everything was perfection. If I were able to pick a waitress every time I came it'd be her. Especially Jake, the manager walked around checking to see if everything was great which it definitely was! Im so glad to come to a place where not only the food was amazing but the service topped it off. They made me and my family's first time experience the very best that we will be coming back more often and making lazy dog our new hot spot!",

My sister had the salmon, I had the cheeseburger, one of my daughters had the fish tacos, and my other daughter had the kids pizza with mashed potatoes.  Everything was great and we had no hiccups. We plan on coming back to try their brunch and bring the boys next time . I definitely recommend this place if you happen to be near by.",

My kids love the brunch here with their Dog Bone Pancakes, French Toast, and various kids Breakfast. I have ALWAYS get the the Pork Fried Rice on Sundays!  I don't know why I've gotten it like 10 times and I can't seem to want anything else?!  The kids menus are very reasonably priced.  4.95-5.95 and includes drinks and the kids meals are generous portions. Bottomless soda/drinks for the kids as well. And the coloring and crayons!  A must for family friendly restaurants!!  Service is good. Food comes out in a reasonable amount of time and the drinks are reasonably priced as well. $5 for a Bloody Mary on Sundays?!!  Yes please!  I'll have 3!!   I'd compare this with a Cheesecake because of the variety but I think the cost is a little less. People can also bring their dogs to dine with them outside. I've been here probably 10x so far in the last 12 months and I've had a great experience each time!",

I love the fact that the patio is so big and you are not cramped up next to another family with a dog.   We got the pitcher of peach sangria and it was the bomb. So we got another! We ordered a bunch of different items and they were all really good.  The birthday boy got the chicken with brown rice and peas and carrots. He was in heaven. I am so glad there is a place we can go as a family to eat that is close by. Sunday brunch is the best, those sangria pitchers were only $15. Woo Hoo! Can't wait to go back.",

I like it there. All that hiking made me hungry and extra thirsty. When we passed by Lazy Dog, I told him to stop XP  We didn't go inside - dogs like me can't go in. But there's a big outdoor area with TVs, fireside seating, and lots of other dogs! So many dogs today, I thought I was at the dog park. [WOOF]. The table next to ours, there was another cool dog and his name was Champ too!  Richard told me there are rules: (1) I can't sit on his lap or the table (I'm too big anyway), (2) no begging, barking, or biting; no problem, (3) I can't eat from his plate (I'll get my own), and (5) he has to keep me on the leash always.  OK! :)  Our kind server brought water and I drank it up. There was chicken on the dog menu, but I wanted hamburger. I even got to choose how it cooks.  [DROOL]. I went with medium. Even comes with choice of white or brown rice - I'm a brown dog so I chose brown rice.  I like it here. More restaurants need to have dog menus. I want to come back again.",

Because it was our first time, we decided on a few different plates to check out the different choices Artichokes were so delicious and made me want more, the the buffalo chicken lollipops were devoured by my friends but my taste of course couldn't handle the heat (I know I know I'm a wimp) Also followed by he creamy Mac and cheese and hush puppies, followed with a butter cake for dessert. Now you will notice that yes, they are all starters, but my friend and I were catching up so we wanted just nibbling options which is exactly what we got.  They also provided a dog meal for our puppy that was allowed on the outside patio... a full menu for dogs is available, we got her the chicken breast and brown rice  This helped it make such a fun day   Lisa, thank you for a great experience  We can't wait til next time",

I love this restaurant because it's so comforting, food is delicious and the vibe is always on point. It is not your typical stuffy Summerlin restaurant at all. It has all your favorite comfort foods AND you get to bring your furbabies. Although I personally have never brought my furbaby here, I do enjoy seeing all the four legged babies hanging out with their family.   I truly enjoy their outside patio. They have this huge fire pit and if you're sitting next to it, you don't even realize that it might my a cold windy Vegas night- because you're warm by the fire! I absolutely love it.   Every time I go I have to indulge in their amazing Chicken Tortilla Soup with avocados. They pair it with this cheese pita cracker that really hits the spot! Perfect. I crave this soup and I always order this. My husband likes to get a little bit of everything when we come here- and the flavors are so great!  **just a side note, be prepared to wait a little longer when they are busy. Service is nice, but we do end up waiting a little longer then usual when there is a game on.  All in all, I definitely recommend this restaurant!",

We stopped in as a party of 3- T, myself and the dog, after a morning up at Calico Basin. We were hungry, sweaty, probably a little smelly and definitely dirty. Seated on the patio, our hostess was super sweet! We were given menus and our waitress immediately popped over and asked for our drink order. I needed more time with the menu and I'm grateful she obliged. I had a hard time making up my mind.   T got the hamburger and fries. DANG is that thing huge. I can't believe it's a kid's burger. It's the same size as an adult. Don't EVER change that portion size, please and thank you!! Kids tend to have crazy big appetites. I have a growing boy. He housed that thing down, along with all the fries. I ordered the blackened chicken bowl sans dairy. It was decent and I was satisfied after.  Obvious perk is that it's insanely dog friendly.",

Chips didn't even fill the plate. We usually order and share but that was not the case today. If it wasn't for the extra jalepenos we would have just had chips with tomatillo salsa on top with the 10 black beans. We started a game of counting the beans. The All American burger was OK. Thin for a half lb burger. We both like the crunch of fresh lettuce. Well that didn't happen.  See picture.    Lazy Dog is usually pretty good but today they were just Lazy.",

So our order of Fettuccini Alfredo was $18.70, with a few tiny little squares of chicken and a salad we paid extra for that had NO dressing. Two extras that amounted to nothing.  We ordered a fried chicken sandwich, that literally had no toppings on it! And we got another little fun bonus with a pomegranate seed in our Mac and cheese side dish.

No big deal. Called the restaurant. Spoke to the girl in take out who informed me they only have the ability to deliver thru a third party so they could only provide me with a voucher for a future dining experience or prepare the food for take out. I chose the option for a future date. I was placed on a brief hold for a manager to square this all away.  The AGM Brooke came onto the phone. Extremely apologetic. Explained to me that not only would she fix the mistake made by the third party vendor but she was going to personally deliver the food and along with it she provided a gift card for our next visit.  I'm telling you this woman is an asset. She went above and beyond to rectify and issue that wasn't even made by the restaurant. The definition of hospitality and customer service.",

I've had Lisa as a server twice now and she's impressed me each time. I'll come back simply for her alone.  I'm also a huge fan of the hummus and green beans. The perfect plan of attack is to bring 2 or 3 friends and each pick a couple small plates and share everything. The only thing I've gotten that I wouldn't recommend is the Cajun fries. They're lacking in just about everything.  On weekend brunches, there's specialties only available until 2PM.  This recently has became a family favorite and unless they do something to change that, I can see my dining here frequently.  From a family outing to a ladies day- this spot can cover it.",

I will commend them as they were kind enough to put up with our ever-growing group. We started with 9 of us, but by the end of the night we had added 5 more. Our server was kind and patient with us while we all chose our food and drinks. Everything came out fairly quickly which was nice and unexpected for such a large party.  The menu is so strange. It's bar food but also has some Asian dishes and Southern comfort food. I ordered the fried chicken dinner which sounded so much more delicious than it was. Here is how they describe it. \"Hand-dipped buttermilk boneless chicken thigh, red skin potato mash, white gravy, spiced maple syrup, sauteed bacon + spinach, roasted sweet corn wheels\". Sounds amazing, right?? Well it might have been but the whole meal was super salty. I could only choke down about half before giving the rest to someone else. The chicken was more like chicken fried steak, and not like traditional fried chicken which was a let down. The spinach was good, but again too salty. I enjoyed the corn wheels that was the only thing that didn't seem to have salt. I washed my meal down with a 16oz Blue Moon.   Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals. It did take a while to get refills and sides of sauces that were requested. We also had 2 items that came out wrong, but they were quickly corrected. This is probably a one and done for me.",

My mom came who is on a walker and can't stand long and had a seat with us.  The pager went off, I went to the hostess stand and she told us to go outside and someone would be out there to seat us.  We went outside and there was no one outside to meet us.  We stood outside and waited and waited and finally I asked one girl who said she would check on our table and never did.  I went back to the hostess and told her I was getting really upset because my mom is on a walker, can't stand and there is no one outside to seat us.  She did apologized and came outside but sat us at a table for 4 crowded between two other tables, REALLY???  The food is good and so far our server is good.  I will update on that later...  The food was good, Adam our server was Awesome...two managers came by and even though we told the waiter who told the managers, not even a free drink, just the standard free ice cream which I don't eat.  Overall other then Adam this experience, is one that will make me not return here, I'm done.  Leadership starts from the top and customer service seems to be consistently poor at both locations.  It's a shame because the food is pretty good but even with that being said, food coming out of the kitchen is hit & miss.  Yesterday there was a lack of attention and the consistency went down as it got busier.",

    "text": "I have been a fan of more than one Lazy Dog location in California. We travel with our fur baby, Brownie, and it's convenient when wanting to stop and grab a bite to eat and have that restaurant feel without having to hit up a fast food drive-thru. This location in Downtown Summerlin was nothing like any of my experiences at other LD restaurants. I came in with a group of friends and inside was pretty busy at first, but really cleared out half way through our meal. Regardless of the amount of customers inside, getting our server to acknowledge us was a major chore. We only ordered some nachos and mac and cheese, so I can't figure out what the problem was and getting drink refills wasn't easy either.   Mac and Cheese ($6.50) - Smoked bacon, hatch chilies, five cheeses, green onion crumble make up their take on this dish. The bacon was very fatty and not good. There was so much green onion crumble on the top, which had a super funky taste to it (one person at my table described it as mold) and it didn't complement the mac and cheese at all. When we asked our server if the mac and cheese from the kids menu was anything special so we could maybe try that also and he responded that it's basically just Kraft mac and cheese.   Chicken Chile Verde Nachos ($10.50) - hand-cut chips, slow-cooked tomatillo chicken, black beans, jack, cheddar, guacamole, salsa, tapatio crema, pickled jalapenos andqueso blanco. The nachos came piles high. Some of the chips were burnt. The toppings tasted decent, but there just wasn't enough of it for the amount of chips. Once we got through the top layer it was all chips after that.  The one plus about this place is that the patio is dog friendly and it's got a decent amount of tables/seating including an area with a fire pit. There's a menu for dogs and they will bring out a water bowl. I can't say I am eager to come back however I'd be open to giving this location another try down the road.",

My only niggle is that one of the bread plates that were pre-staged on the table had what appeared to be dried egg or mustard all over it, and both my and my wife's linen napkins, while clean, were stained to the point of looking like old handkerchiefs.  Short of a little QC needed in these areas, we really enjoyed our lunch and will definitely be back.",

    "text": "This is my second review on the Lazy Dog.  This 5 star review goes out to Jake the manager. His professional sincere and caring manner in which he handled an issue with service was nothing short of great. We've eaten here with family and friends many times and it's our go to place downtown summerlin.  The situation was while eating our appetizer our soup and entree,s all hit our table at the same time. According to an employee it was the way they were trained to bring the food out. Ok I get it. Get em in get em seated and get em out. After speaking with Jake all was handled in a manner that will keep us coming back. We weren't looking for a freebie or looking to even complain. I thought it best to bring the situation to the attention of management to prevent the same thing happening to other diners. I would never negatively review any establishment without speaking with the person in charge first. Jake immediately knew how to fix the situation  and did so with an apologetic attitude and smile. Thank you Jake!!",

    "text": "So it's 9/12/18 and I decided to give Lazy Dog another try and this time I decided to take my lunch break and have lunch inside the restaurant. I ordered an ice tea and no straw was given to me , 6 minutes later waiting for my server to walk by no site of her so I had to walk up to the host and asked her if I could get a straw. She was nice enough to grab me one but had her hand at the top of it where my mouth goes so that grossed me out and I didn't want to use it. I don't blame her for not knowing though since it's not her job to do so. After my salad arrived about 20 minutes later and I proceeded to eat it. It was much better then the first one I got months ago, my waitress then disappeared for another 25-30minutes before checking on me and asking if everything was ok. But by that time I only had 5 bites left of my salad , and took another 10 minutes after that to come back to give me the check. Long story short the food was better but the service was barely mediocre at finest. Really frustrating that I can't get good service at this place especially because it's so close to my work.",

After we were seated it took at least another 5 minutes for the server to acknowledge our presence. Based on the timing so-far we immediately ordered the entrees with our wine and cocktails. The entrees arrived cold, but the server never checked back to ask if everything was satisfactory. When she arrived with the check I informed her that the food was luke warm/cold. She said she would inform the kitchen.  Very difficult to understand why a multi-million dollar investment would be jeopardized by trying to save money on minimum wage staffing. Lazy Dog Corporate better wake up! The competition for Las Vegas restaurant customers is more fierce than a pit-bull going after a prime rib!",

We loved this place because it was both dog friendly and well, toddler friendly (patio makes for lots of room to walk around without being in the way).   The first few times we had pretty excellent service and the food was great!! This review will be based on the last 2 or 3 times we've been there (always in the patio, always with a toddler and our pup) Service in the patio has gone WAY down... I'm not sure if it's management's assignment of servers in that area or what, but something bad is happening and patio guests and their dogs are being neglected a little.  The most recent time we were there we sat for a solid 15-20 minutes waiting to be greeted and for our drink order to be taken.  My husband asked our hostess about 15 minutes after being seated if she knew who our waiter is and she said \"No, but I can find a server to come to your table...\" Ok. You're the hostess, shouldn't you know who is supposed to be serving us?? So eventually a female server came to our table and said she wasn't our server, but she could take our order. Oh cool!! Thanks. We ordered two iced teas and a water for our dog.  The iced teas came about 10 minutes later, but no dog water.  As a dog-themed restaurant that prides itself in being dog-friendly, it was kind of like pulling teeth to get water for our dog... Anyway, eventually after asking a few more times, we got some water for the dog and ordered our food. Food came out wrong, but was fixed quickly and tasted good.    We also noticed the table next to us irritated about getting their food for their dog waaaaaay after they got their meals.  They ended up just getting it to go because they were done with their meals by the time the dog's food came.    I hope the service inside the restaurant is better. It was a Wednesday night and definitely not busy in the patio. Maybe 3 or 4 tables.",

The nachos was not good at all, and the chicken was not fresh and it tasted like they were cooked two days ago, then served to us. I have been here more than a year ago and the food was good at that time. I don't know what had happened from that time until now. I had no choice to give them a star to post this but this time they don't deserve this star. Please change the way you cook the food here.",

    "text": "My sister, best friend and I decided we wanted to try somewhere different for dinner in the Summerlin area. I got a little lost at first but I eventually found the restaurant after I called the restaurant and clarified where is the location. The restaurant is actually located towards the back of the Downtown Summerlin Mall, closer to Red Rock Hotel and Casino.  It was a Thursday night and it wasn't too busy. We were sat pretty much right away. This is the place to go if you want to bring your dogs because it's dog friendly and they even have an outside area to dine. We didn't bring any dogs though, so we sat inside.   The menu had many options from appetizers, burgers/sandwiches, pastas, salads. I ordered a Ahi Tuna Burger with fries on the side and it was delicious. The waitress was honest and nice; she also gave us some recommendations since it was our first time there. I would definitely come back if I was around the area and would like to try something new from the menu.",

I'm always offered bar seating, outside seating, or dining. I'm over 21 so I personally opt always for happy hour of its available in the bar area, and because I usually try to find Brooke! She is absolutely one the best servers there. She always has the right drink or food choice to try out. It seems I'm not the only fan base of hers, or she just makes friends with everyone there and treats like them like they have been friends forever.  I have to say the outside seating area in the summer is the place to be because happy hour goes out there, and plus you can bring your pup! I personally don't have one, so I love seeing all the little fur babies hanging out. If you're trying to figure out an entree, and maybe slightly hungry, a fan fav and my fav is the grilled garlic flatbread with marinara sauce, or if you need a bigger hold you over the chicken lettuce wraps are an excellent choice.",

We were surrounded by nice people and their dogs and we loved it. The fire pit area outside is just so nice! They have water and foods available for the dogs. I love the decor inside and out. Their drink menu has some interesting choices and my husband has found a new favorite drink (Jamaican something?). The food hasn't let us down. We've had the bison burger, nachos, fish and chips, and turkey meatballs. They were all fantastic. We can't wait for our next trip with our pup in tow.

My friend has 2 young children and my sister's friends have a large dog so the patio was perfect for our party of 10. We were sat in front of a large outdoor fan that was blowing very cool air. Amazing,  since it was so hot out. Kept our table cool...I almost needed a jacket...lol. The menu was a little overwhelming.  Too many interesting choices. I went with the carnitas hash with sweet potato tater tots. The sauce was delish and you can gobble it up with the taters. The carnitas were tasty too. From my view of the table,  we all ordered the same except my little 3 year old friend got the make your own pizza. Fantastic idea... They bring out the pizza dough with the fixins on the side and you put them on however you darn please and they bring it back to the kitchen to cook. Kids love it!! We also got donuts. Warm, sweet yumminess with chocolate dipping sauce.  Kinda tasted like a churro, maybe because of the kinda crispy sugary (greasy)outside. I could only eat one. Too rich for me but the kids gobbled them up...as well as the big kids too. Lots of doggies.  Most were well behaved except for one lone barker. Good service. I liked what I ordered. Someone else had pad Thai and someone else had the breakfast sandwich which they both said were ok. We have lazy dog near us in Cali too but I've never been for brunch. Only for drinks and apps. All good. Great prices.",

EVERYTHING taste frozen and poorly made. Last night I ordered a strawberry/banana milkshake and the waitress brought me an Icey smoothie and tried to tell me the guy used too much puree. It was a smoothie from the bar!! Most bars do not have ice cream behind the counter just some bs daiquiri mix. I ordered the chicken wings and schitzel and all were terrible.",

    "text": "Found this place on yelp after I'd gone to an hour & a half long interview. I was famished and jittery. What a gem of a place! Besides the area on the patio that accommodates dogs, it's a lovely ambiance that you can sit for hours (literally!). I was here for at least 4 hours talking the afternoon away. Soon it was evening & dinner time. You just feel warm and cozy here.  So now let's talk about the food -  I found the choices to be different and ecclectic. Very nice presentation and my pesto/basil pasta was delish! My friend had the blackened chicken salad which I took a bite from. It was somewhat spicy but not too spicy. I thought it would be a great dish if there was some ranch on it. I'm definitely going to return to this place. There's quite a few items I'd like to try. The clean and clear cut menus make choosing simple. However, on the flip side of great, I'd like to see more variety of sauces. Campfire sauce, creamy pesto, creamy blue cheese, etc. In addition, please try adding crispy chicken to your menu. I'd like to have the chicken salads but prefer crispy chicken strips sliced up.  Otherwise, a wonderful experience. You should try this place out too.",

It doesnt seem that there are very many places in Vegas that are this dog friendly so its a lot of fun to bring my dog by.  The food is a great price. They have lots of different options... from asian inspired dishes to american burgers. Lazy Dog also caters to vegetarians by providing tofu options on thier \"bowls\" and sides, starters, and salads that are great portions (I recommend the hummus platter and sweet potato tater tots). Pair that with one of thier fancy cocktails or a beer from thier list of drafts and you are golden!  Dogs also have a choice to dine with you where they are served brown rice and fresh chicken or hamburger. My dog love this place for this reason.   The atmosphere is very family friendly so its a great place to go when family is in town or a casual night out.",

    "text": "This is a doggy friendly restaurant (outdoor section only), which is pretty neat!  I ordered the lunch special: Half Sandwich (Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich) & Half Soup (Cream of Asparagus) w/ fries = $8.75  Portion size:  They give a pretty generous amount of food for a lunch menu. The soup was more than a cup, and the half sandwich was pretty big. I eat a lot, and this was sufficient. If their lunch size was sufficient, I'm assuming regular menu would be more.  Taste:  The Cream of Asparagus was delicious. It was creamy & thick, and that's how I like my soup. They also top it with fresh pieces of asparagus. The Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich was creamy, generous amount of chicken, but the bread was too dry for me. Fries were average - not bad, but not the best.  Price: Their prices are standard. Meals start $5 (small plate) and can go up to $27  Ambience: Decor & interior is nice. Very cabin/woods-y. And of course, a lot of pictures & artwork of dogs.  Service: Our server was good & on top of things. They were slightly busy, but our server didn't neglect our table at all.  I'd definitely come back here & try other items on their menu.",

    "text": "Lazy Dog was crowded, but we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table at around 8:30 p.m., and it's Saturday night.  That's because it's a big place, and offers a variety of seating in the restaurant, bar, and also the patio, where (wo)man's best friend can join you for dinner.    The only canines with us tonight were in our mouths, and they wanted to do their work.  But first, the drinks.  I was thrilled to see that Lazy Dog hasn't copied every other chain restaurant.  They actually have the drink prices printed on their menus!!!  Having been burned more than a few times, we always ask, and we didn't have to endure the waitress saying \"I THINK the price is...,\" or have a server run back to the bar repeatedly to ask the bartenders.  I deplore this practice, so it was refreshing.  And so was the Peach Bellini I ordered, which was served in a tall, skinny glass with the peach puree , and a fresh individual 187 ml bottle of Freixenet Cava on the side. The draft beer list is extensive, and the prices are reasonable - my Bellini was 7.25, and I could have had a margarita for less, and his draft Tenaya Creek was 4.00 for 16 oz.  My husband ordered the Chicken Pot Pie, and I decided on the Chicken with veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  We also ordered a side salad, and our waitress properly asked if we wanted it before or with our meals.  We wanted it before, to share a little nibble before the main event. The one downfall in the service is that it never appeared, but the runner came out with our entrees.  Rather than have the food taken back to get cold, we cancelled the salad.  The hubster loved his pot pie.  I wasn't all that crazy about my pasta dish:  it was bland, the eggplant cubes were undercooked, and it was way too salty.  Though I have no trouble sending back a dish that isn't prepared properly, I was going to just stick with it.  But suddenly, unbidden, a young woman appeared, introduced herself as Lorena, a manager, and asked how my food was.  Not my husband's, just mine.  I told her all about it, but said I was going to keep it, even after she offered to get me something else.  Turns out that she's not a manager at this branch; she's from corporate, and is charged with getting this new restaurant up and running.  It's their first location outside of California, and they want to get it right before their next venture into Texas.  She said that they'd had a number of complaints about my entree, namely all of the things I found wrong with it.  She stated that she was already taking it off the check, and insisted I get another entree, even if I had it boxed up to take home, which she also was going to comp.  How could I resist!!  Act II was the Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich, on the brioche roll instead of the multigrain bread, at Lorena's suggestion.  All the stuff I love:  walnuts, curry mayo, cranberries, and more.  It was delish!!  But more important, that experience was Service, with a capital S.  We both really love Lazy Dog, and their very big menu - plus a nice Happy Hour menu - and with the location pretty close to home, we'll be back again and again.",

I love the pan fried tofu with vegetables and the sparkling strawberry lemonade was very refreshing. However, I did not like the paper straw in the drink as it started to become flimsy after being saturated for so long and I could not sip to finish the bottom of the drink. Also, I had requested no mushrooms and my meal was served with mushrooms. I explained that it could have been more serious if it was an allergy as opposed to a preference, which is why I was frustrated having to pick them out. I also refused to wait for the meal to be prepared again, as I did not want my bf's food to get cold.   Nevertheless, the server and manager apologized and the meal was taken off of the bill. We will be back because they do show a great effort to please customers.",

I was told I couldn't have my lap dog on my lap by the passing hostess while 30% of the other dog owners in the patio did, only because I was seated in plain view of the patio doorway.

My Italian Grey's were a little anxious on the floor. I asked the waiter for the manager.. did not come out, instead he explained the reason behind the dumb rule. \"Health Codes\" didn't make sense after seeing dog food plates going from the dirty hairy floor to the table we eat on to be picked up by a busser.  Explain that",

    "text": "One of the best burgers I have had in Vegas!  Food is excellent!    Our server got a little preoccupied and took 35+ minutes to get our food (2 burgers with fries).  The manager happened to be walking around greeting customers and we inquired about the delay.  I think her name was Brook.  She personally handled our service from that point on.  She brought us an excellent queso dip and chips, then shortly returned with our order.  Brook covered our costs and even offered us dessert on the house.  We were so full from the meal, we had to pass on the desert. They made every attempt to make sure our visit went as good as possible from that point on, and it was.    I understand mishaps can happen from time to time, but the Staff at The Lazy Dog went above and beyond to correct the small issue.  We will be returning for more great food!",

Reminds me of places you'd find in Northern California. Huge menu selection. You have to try the sangria sampler! They are all delicious! The hush puppies, the nachos, and Cajun fries appetizers are yummy. The pot roast is good but the mashed potatoes taste like box potatoes:( I don't like the poblano chicken it's bland no spice to it. My favorite entree is the ginger salmon. For dessert, the crumble dessert, key lime cheesecake and smores are really good. My favorite dessert is the warm butter cake. Now that I have been here a few times I know exactly what I like and what my dog Sadie likes now.",

The restaurant was pretty crowded because of the dinner rush. We were seated after about 15 minutes of waiting.   Our table shared Cajun Fries and a Brick Oven Spinach & Sundried Tomato Cheese Dip for starters. The dip was too salty for me. The fries were okay.   I chose to share a chicken pot pie and a Tex-Mex salad with my friend since we wanted both things. The chicken pot pie was huge, but it only had a crust on top. It was basically the easier way to make a pot pie. The pot pie also had huge chunks of chicken which I didn't enjoy because that's basically all you would eat in one bite. The Tex-Mex salad was good and very big. Next time I would probably do without the black beans since I'm not a fan of them. The dressing was a nice accompaniment too.   Our waitress was very friendly and helpful with all the questions we had. Overall, we had a decent meal here.",

The happy hour deals are really good and make it a decent place. It was packed.   First we got a pitcher of the white peach sangria to share. Too sweet for my taste but I was definitely feeling a little tipsy by the end. I'd maybe try another flavor if I were to return.   We ended up ordering from the happy hour menu  Hawaiian ahi poke: served on little chips, nothing too special about it  Garlic flatbread: again nothing too memorable.  Inside out quesadilla: most interesting item. Quesadilla with cheese also on the outside and grilled. Pretty good.  Spicy buffalo chicken nuggets: my favorite item that we ordered. Full of flavor and cute presentation with little sticks in them. Yum.   Overall it was a decent place but nothing too great about it. We also couldn't find our waitress for a long time to get our check so that was slightly annoying.",

    "text": "I arrived yesterday @ 11:30 to meet my friend Diane (1st time here) on the patio.  The last time I'd been there, dogs were allowed on half the patio & the patrons w/out dogs on the other half.  Not the case now.  Five women showed up with a poodle & 2 guys with an Airedale.  The noise level, due to a barking dog on the other side, Crate & Barrel construction that abuts the restaurant, & the garbage on the stereo were over the top for an afternoon lunch outdoors.  But we just had to be outside on this beautiful day.  Our server appeared shortly and we ordered 2 salads:  chicken/sundried tomato/feta, and the new strawberry w/goat cheese, both of us requesting dressing on the side.  Though the restaurant had few patrons, the food took way too long to appear.  When the salads arrived, I added creamy balsamic to mine & soon discovered the chef had already added dressing, so I had a bowl of dressing.  But that wasn't all... each cherry tomato was old & squishy, there was a small sliver of cheese, a few gushy strawberries, and for some reason they had little gobs of crunchy cereal throughout.  And this was whose idea?  My friend said her salad was okay, but it came with the lettuce shredded which restaurants seem to think is so cool these days.  A pet peeve of mine that leaves me frustrated & curious is why servers don't seem to be trained on seating arrangements (assuming there are enough other alternatives)...  i.e. if 2 seniors arrive, why would you seat them next to whiney children?  Or:  why would you seat two diners next to a table of 5 cackling women with a dog?  Or next to the kitchen, or in winter next to the outside door?  Know what I mean?  I soon realized that the great manager Phil has been gone for a few months, explaining why this trip (as well as the last) left a lot to be desired. And though this optimist doesn't want to adhere to \"all good things must come to an end,\" I'm going for greener pastures.",

I thought it was great that we had two servers for such a big party. Our glasses were always filled, the food was all brought out at a timely manner, the servers were both kind, made split checks an easy process and helped us enjoy our celebration even more by such attentive service. Everyone enjoyed their food too!   I tried several dishes, including the turkey meatballs, chicken salad sandwich, Brussels sprouts, Cajun fries, inside out quesadilla, edamame and butter cake. The Brussels sprouts and butter cake were my favorite selections! The Brussels sprouts were served in a cast iron dish with a lemon butter sauce, capers and a little char on them. I didn't realize I was a fan of these little veggies until now. The butter cake? Oh my god. Crunchy crust, gooey butter inside, strawberry balsamic reduction and vanilla ice cream. At $5.50 it can't be beat. We ordered one and then another because it was that good. I look forward to coming back to this place. Bring your pup and hang out on the patio.",

Initially a 40-50 minute wait for a Friday night and no same day reservations. Turned out to be an almost 60 minute wait. Not many places I have been to which does not offer same day reservations. Server was friendly and took our orders within 15 minutes of being seated. Here is where the fun begins. 7 adults placed 7 entrees with 7 drinks, 2 starters, and 1 appetizer. The appetizer came out surprisingly fast. Brother in law ordered a salad and mother in law ordered the tortilla soup. Both starters only came out only when all the entrees came out at the surprising speed of ONE HOUR LATER!!! Salad had the wrong dressing and soup had to be put in a to-go container. Manager came to explain that the kitchen staff was overwhelmed... \"OVERWHELMED\"!!! Hahahahah having worked in the industry when I was younger, overwhelmed was never a valid excuse ESPECIALLY when it takes one hour to pump out 7 entrees. However, meals were decent and management comped us with free desserts as an apology. Main focal point: Hire a competent kitchen staff who can pump out the meals on the menu in a timely manner. Oh and to anybody who chooses to bring their infants, word of advice: BRING HEARING PROTECTION AND A MINIMAL OF THREE FEEDING BOTTLES!!!",

Daria was our server and she was on point with everything and super sweet and nice. We started with the spinach dip which was so cheesy and good.  Our meals were mom's pot pie, pot roast beef dip and a pizza, everything was cooked to perfection and we were all happy with this visit.  We are thrilled with the outcome and we definately will be repeat customers now.",

I could go on and on about reasons why I'll never go there again and it's sad because the place is nice, the beer is good and the food is mediocre at best. I will never go to this establishment again...",

    "text": "At first glance, I was thinking, just another novelty over-hyped Summerlin 'must go because everyone else is' restaurant, you know the ones... I don't get the dog thing though. I have a dog, love dogs, but when I go out to eat, my dog stays home. At least they keep those who cannot be away from their dogs for an hour out on the patio. That being said, this review is for the food and it was pretty good. To start, we tried: 1) calamari - Asian sweet style, unique in my book, not the typical fried with marinara stuff. Tasty! 2) Hummus sampler. Good hummus...not so good on the lack of bread for dipping. You don't get pita bread, you get some kind of super thin cracker...and very few of them at that, plus some sliced tomato and cucumbers, was more like a salad or something. I'll pass on this next time. Main course, we tried: 1) I attempted to try the pulled pork sandwich but they were all out of pork (this was a Saturday around 630) either they don't make enough or it's that popular.I was told it'd be 20 minutes to make some more and I passed. Got the chicken sandwich, was okay, nothing great. Lacked flavor. 2) Margherita pizza. This was good. Nice crispy crust, good sauce, good cheese.  This is a noisy place, don't come here for a romantic dinner. Also, it seems really busy at the front reception, but wait times weren't all that bad, like 20 minutes",

    "text": "Not sure how this place got 4 stars. This place is a joke of an establishment. We waited at least 20 min to even get an order in. I had a group of people with 4 dogs total. We suggested to come here because of the great reviews and it's dog friendly! The food took forever to come out as well. The service is so slow, I swear coming out of that place, I aged another few years. I was better off in a long ass coma than to be there. Fascists don't got nothing on this place when it comes down to a slow and painful death... Ok, on to the food review.  We ordered the Hawaiian poke. That's a slap to the Hawaiian people. This poke was on a tortilla chip with smeared guacamole and 3 pieces of small tuna. I wouldn't have even fed it to my dogs. Next, the pizza. Wtf, seriously, the pizza wasn't even a pizza. I ordered the all American burger. It was so gross, I couldn't even eat half. It came out so cold, I felt like I was eating a hamburger that came out of a refrigerator. Even North Korea wouldn't feed it to their enemies. The vegetable lasagna. Oh Jesus.. Where do I even start in this. It reminded me of lean cuisine. Prison inmates get fed way better than this slop. What was the best part of the meal? The dog food I ordered. I ordered the grilled chicken and hamburger with brown rice. It was the only thing that looked fresh and delicious. Yes, the dog meal looked way better and apparently tasted way better than the food because someone in our group was still starving because they didn't want to eat their own food. They said the grilled chicken was really good. Be warned, if you come here, just order the dog food, you'll get a better meal than the slop they serve.",

    "text": "You ever just know a place isn't going to be good but you go anyway? That was how I went into dinner at Lazy Dog. I hadn't read the reviews or the menu, and despite my love for dogs, and the ability to bring them here, I just wasn't \"digging\" the place. I certainly get the appeal. I wanna like it. I really do. But, I just doesnt do it for me. We arrived a party of 10, at 5:30 on a Tuesday night. The place looked empty at first, but once we got seated, it was quite crowded. (Bonus for us not having to wait more than 5 minutes.) The service was rather slow, and although busy, there seemed to be a lot of staff walking around. It took a while for them take our drink order, and it took quite a bit for them to be delivered. Which really sucked when they brought lousy drinks. My cadilac margarita was gross. No Grand Marnier floater as indicated and required of said drink. Just a way too sweet, yucky margarita. I switched to a mojito after first drink and liked that one better. Reviewing the menu, I wasn't impressed. Nothing really jumped out at me. I did order for an appetizer the brussell sprouts. They were quite good. We really enjoyed them. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos with flour tortillas. I didn't really care for them. They weren't bad, but they weren't good. Something just didn't mesh well for me. My side wedge salad was pretty decent.  For dessert, I got to try the keylime cheesecake and the brownie. Both were ok. Nothing to get all jazzed up about, but certainly fine. I believe it was Brian A's review where it said it's exactly as you'd expect, he's correct. It's exactly what I expected, and I got that. So, nope, I would not return.",
