The Customer Service is spot freakin' on!   The fish is fresh and flavorful, and there are many toppings to choose from. I particularly liked all the sauce options. Figure I'd start at the top and just go down the list.  Will be frequenting this place ALOT.",

My usual order is a medium bowl with everything spicy all the way. Size of fish and other add-in conspired to other poke places is amazing. You get a free miso soup and they have some interesting complimentary teas to try.

Pick your carbs, pick your fish, pick your toppings...etc. Nothing we aren't already used to.  I've eaten here and its other locations on several occasions and never had a bad experience. I love the complimentary refreshments they have such as the barley, corn and jasmine(?) water. The service is always friendly and the girls working there are pretty cute (just saying :D).  Every location has a check-in deal via Facebook that saves you mula + a stamp card. You really get the bang for your buck. Dine in and you get free miso soup as well. They just love showering you with freebies and I'm not complaining man.  Lastly, the macaroon ice cream is my favorite. I've seen the same ice cream at several different restaurants and they seem to be slowly replacing mochi ice creams to be the next staple, cool treat. Love this place and the one on eastern/215, I'll be writing a separate review for that one as well.  Keep doing what you do PP, stay cool, don't change",

    "text": "Poke bars are a dime a dozen these days, but some much better than others . Poke Poku calls themselves a Hawaiian style poke bar, but I am not sure what is \"Hawaiian\" about it. I  think they are about the same as other places, with the exception of some fried appetizers and desserts.  What I liked: - Complimentary teas available - Free Miso soup when you dine in - Free Wi-Fi - Fruit toppings like pineapple and mango - Lots of fun sauce combinations  - Friendly workers   What I didn't like  - Avocado is offered as a side, but it's more like guacamole. I dont care for guacamole in my poke bowl and I'd rather have fresh avocado. - The price is much more expensive than competitors. A large bowl, which is 4 scoops of protein, is $13.50.   -The miso soup, although free, was only filled up a quarter of the way full and was pretty tasteless.  All in all, if I want to spend $15 on lunch, I will probably go elsewhere.",

When ordering the girl informed us that they close at 9pm and asked if we're taking it to go to which I said no... we're dining in. While we were eating the food (which was OK but nothing special in a world of poke bowls) they started vigorously cleaning the store and putting the chairs up. Made us feel \"very welcome\"... like \"can you hurry up and get out since we want to close now\" welcome. By 8:52pm the sign was off and store was closed. In my opinion... if your hours are till 9pm - you serve till 9pm. Otherwise there is a whole bunch of other places to choose from where we are not rushed out of the door because staff looks like they are late for a Friday night party.",

There's many more toppings you will find only here like crunchy onion, tobiko, mango, pineapple, etc.  I have come twice already and plan to come back many more times.

    "text": "I have been waiting to try this place out since hearing some good reviews from friends. Finally decided to go and saw that it was on Yelp Eat24 so I placed an online order for pick up. I ordered a Poke Burrito and a Poke Bowl. Went in a little early to see if it happened to be ready and was told they \"forgot\" the order. Waited some more and then was told they ran out of spicy tuna. Opted for the tuna and waited again and finally it was ready. Since it wasn't busy inside decided to dine in. Opened bowl and saw no sauce. Took first bite and tasted no sauce although they said it was on there. Waited again to get a side of sauce. After all that the bowl was very good. The burrito was too. Then I get to the mochi ice cream and it was hard as a rock and you could see the icicles on top. Asked if they could defrost it and they said they would. Then they come back to say all their mochi is like that and offered to give a macaron ice cream sandwich in place of the mochi. That was very nice of them. Despite the mishaps during my very first visit here, I will be coming back because the food was delicious and I hope to have a much better experience.",

The first employee to acknowledge we were there came and stood in front of us without greeting us in any way.  No \"hi\", no smile. Just stood there.  She seemed very put out to have to do her job.  The second employee working the line seemed annoyed when I wanted my sauce on the side.  No smile or politeness from any of the 3 workers.  The owner needs to watch this.  I don't care how good the food is somewhere, if the employees annoy me I won't go back.  Business lost for them.",

    "text": "First time here - the BOGO happy hour from 2-5 brought me here. Buy one bowl/burrito whatever and get the second one free, for dine in only though which is fine. This place was very similar to many other poke places that are springing up in las vegas now. You have to pick your starter- white rice, brown, rice, salad, or mixed salad then you move on to your normal proteins and toppings. I was kind of sad they had run out of yellowtail already though (it was around 300?). They did just open so I think they are still trying to get everything right - I say this because they were really slow, but this is something I think they will get with time. The miso soup was a little salty. Oh! They have multiple desserts you can get like the potato twister! I wanted to try it but I had already gotten a medium size bowl with 3 proteins in it They have a multitude of sauces and one secret sauce that wasn't on the wall they provide called the GUCCI SAUCE. This shiz was good. I can't tell you what's in it because they would not tell me whatsoever..it's the secret sauce haha I also really liked the feel of this place - very Hawaii and made me feel really relaxed. One thing I distinctly remember is one of the waitresses/workers (?) walking around wiping tables with Christian Louboutin heels on LOL I give her props for working in this type of establishment with high heels lolol I will definitely be back to test this place out again.",

I just dont get why this one girl only wears one glow when she handles your food. All the other workers wear 2 glowes on both hands as they are suppose to, this one girl who always happens to serve me only wears 1 glove on her right hand only and it happened 3x now.  And I dont see her wearing the glove when I walk in it seems like she already has one on all the time. Which makes me little uncomfortable since she is touching my food with her hands and I dont know what her hands has touched before she touches my food. Since its raw fish I think they should put on their gloves infront of the customers and not have them on already while waiting for the next customer. Dont know if they use the same glove for so many customers or if they change them with each customer.  Just something I am very picky about it is hygiene. Since its dealing with food and health. Taking one star of for the wearing one glove only issue. Other than that no other complaints.",

Starting with either a salad or bowl option (with several sizing options). Next you choose your sides. They have many options to chose from; Spicy crab meat, regular crab meat, avocado, edamame, etc..Next up you get to pick your fish. They have so many fish options including yellowtail, ahi, and octopus. The fish is always fresh and plentiful. Then you chose your sauce, and toppings. There are free teas you can drink and the music they play is awesome.  Don't forget to use their punch card for frequent purchases.",

I'm not even finished eating my poke but I felt so compelled to rave about it because it is very worth the praise that other yelp reviews have given it. They have 3 sizes (small, medium, and large) and as I have mentioned in a previous Yelp review, usually poke places only have regular and large sizes. The amount of toppings that you can get for no additional charge is huge! Including 5 different colors of masago, a super duper delicious soft shell crab mix, full cloves of roasted garlic, bonito flakes, etc. I also love that they are really generous with their portions...you will definitely be full even with a small! Additionally, they have complimentary health teas on the side which go well with the poke!   Service is very friendly and helpful(they even gave me an extra topping choice for no reason), sauce choices are unique and delicious, and overall this place is just plain awesome. Do yourself a favor and stop by! I live quite far from here, but after trying this place, I will definitely be back because I think I found my new favorite poke restaurant!",

My friend had just came here earlier on the day and told our \"group\" (fb chat) about the lunch special. Sushi Burrito with miso soup (dine in only) for $5, their house-made teas (dine in only - varies per day), and 3 gyoza ($1.50 extra)  -----------------------  Their original menu is as follows  Step 0 - Poke Bowl/Poke Salad - Small $9.50 (2 scoops), Medium $11.50 (3 scoops), Large $13.50 (4 scoops). Hawaiian poke - 5 oz $8.00, 10 oz $14.00. Poke burrito - 1 scoop $7.50, 2 scoop $9.00.   Sides - Shrimp Shumai $5.00 (6 pieces), Gyoza $5.00 (6 pieces), Takoyaki $4.00 (6 pieces)  Step 1 - Base - White rice, brown rice, half and half, mixed salad  Step 2 - Sides (Choose 2 - Extra side +$1.50) - Seaweed salad, edamame, crab meat, spicy crab meat, avocado, fried shrimp tempura  Step 3 - Protein (Extra Protein +$1.75) - Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, scallop, snapper, spicy tuna, soft shell crab, shrimp, octopus, seared albacore  Step 4 - Mix Ins - Masago, red onion, white onion, cucumber, cilantro, pineapple, mango, organic tofu, tomato  Step 5 - Toppings (Unlimited) - Green onion, jalapeno, crispy onion, roasted garlic, tamago, kizami nori, bonito, sea salt, ginger, corn, tobiko, wasabi, shichimi  Mix in Sauces - (lots of styles, essentially a mix of different sauces) but they include Sesame oil, spicy mayo, spicy chili, sriracha, aloha, ponzu, shichimi, eel, yuzu ponzo, mango, guzzi, Korean spicy chili, wasabi mayo.   -----------------------  I had opt'ed for the lunch special and I was not completely hungry and I tend to not eat that much for the \"first meal\" of the day. My sushi burrito consisted of a seaweed wrap which had white rice added by a machine with a sprinkle of furikake. For some reason, I opted to have seaweed salad and spicy crab meat. They pile the sides on before getting a metal mixing bowl for your protein, mix in items, and sauces. As a salmon lover, I definitely went for salmon and added red onion, cucumber. Wasn't too familiar with the sauces but I opt'ed to try their \"signature\" poke poku style which consisted a mix of sesame oil, spicy mayo, spicy chili, sriracha, and aloha. Not sure what aloha is. Lol   What I didn't realize is for burritos, you cant get toppings cuz (for obvious reasons) you cant really put toppings on a burrito. Lol.. DANG IT (next time im getting a bowl LOL) They wrap it up and cut in half. If you dine in with the lunch special, they give you a small bowl of miso soup, and \"access\" to the house-made teas (but to be honest, cups are right next to it, I think anyone can get to it)   The ingredients they use are pretty good. My only complaint is too much sauce is used in the mix. Next time I may opted out or just pick a specific sauce or two to use. Made it quite messy to eat and sauce filled. Would like a more \"natural\" taste. Sauce seemed to cover a lot.   SIDE NOTE: one some of the side tables, they have Samsung QI's wireless charging pads for people to charge their phones while enjoying their meal.",

    "text": "Poke Poku is one of the better poke bowl options- despite marketing themselves as Hawaiian, they've got the standard build-as-you-go format. PP stands out by having more add-on and mix-in options with a traditional slant, like roasted garlic, furikake seasoning, dried seaweed, tomato, bonito, and pineapple. They also have a variety of traditional-sounding teas available at the drink station, though I admittedly didn't care for the ones I tried.   Unlike most of the other poke bowl places, they have tofu and scallop as protein options. They get a bonus star for mixing the protein, veggies, and sauce by hand before putting them in the bowl. This seems obvious, but a lot of places just drizzle sauces on top or leave the bowl dry, and the marinated flavors are a big component of what i look for in a great poke bowl (americanized or otherwise).   There's free miso soup with dine-in. It's free, yes, but it's also possibly the worst miso soup I've ever had, because it had a distinct dishwater taste to it that made me think, \"no wonder it's free.\" Definitely an area to improve upon, but one that's easy to overlook when your seating options include a giant indoor beach umbrella to turn your lunch break into a mental mini-vacation!",

Before I used to buy burritos for my whole family. My family loves them. So when we get to the end of ordering, I would ask for them to sprinkle on some of the extra garnishes in them to add flavor, color, and texture.  Suddenly out of nowhere, they stopped doing that. I tell them every single time that I am willing to pay for them. But now, they said that they're ordered not to by the owner and risk being fired.  NOTE TO MANAGEMENT: Please please please find a way for customers to GIVE YOU MORE MONEY. I don't know why you would make it hard for your customers to enjoy your delicious food. Customers are willing to pay for the toppings and garnishes you already have that are sitting there getting warm. It's ridiculous that bowls get them but the burritos don't. At least make it an option for us to pay for them.  I'd be happy to pay another buck or two to get what I want.  But now, I'm forced to go find other places where they would happily make customers what they want and appreciate my business.",

    "text": "I still have a few more local places to try, including a vaunted Hawaiian import (which is a bit like comparing apples to pears, but that's another story), but I'll just come out and say it: best poke bowl place I've tried so far.  Poke Poku is one of many similar restaurants on Rainbow Blvd that's trying to ride the latest fad. They're deep within a plaza next to Goodwill, and they're conveniently across the side street from beloved bubble tea shop Brew Tea Bar.  Poke Poku does bill itself as a \"Hawaiian\" poke restaurant, but it's still fashioned in the style of most poke bowl places in that you're assembling the product step-by-step a la Chipotle (but with seafood and typical ingredients):  \"Start Here\" - there are more options now than they had when I peeked in during their first week. You can choose from a poke bowl/salad, \"Hawaiian Poke\" (served without rice/greens), or sushi burrito (one size fits all). I went with a large poke bowl ($13.50 for 4 scoops of protein). There are also numerous appetizers available, but those only need to be ordered at the register.  Step 1 (\"Base\") - white rice, brown rice, mixed salad, baby kale, or a half and half mix of any of those. I stuck with the white rice.  The employee asked at this point if I wanted furikake, and I said yes. Why not have good seasoning, right?  Step 2 (\"Sides\") - pick two of the seaweed salad, edamame, crab meat, spicy crab meat, avocado, or fried shrimp tempura. I went for seaweed salad and shrimp tempura, and both were actually about as good as you'd expect. Extra sides available for $1.50  Step 3 (\"Protein\") - went with tuna, yellowtail, seared albacore, and salmon (after being informed that snapper was unavailable). Also available are bay scallop ,spicy tuna, soft shell crab, diced shrimp, and octopus, with extra proteins worth $1.75 each... hmm, maybe I should've tried to game them by doing a small bowl with two extra proteins?  \"Sauce\" (not an actual step): select from predesigned mixtures of sauces, or perhaps create your own out of what appeared to be a dozen different sauces. I went with the namesake Poke Poku Style, which was sesame oil, spicy mayo, spicy chili, sriracha, and something called Aloha sauce (note from a Hawaiian co-worker: if this is the shoyu brand, then the sauce has two key components of traditional poke). The end result did not taste too spicy, so don't worry about those labels unless you're ultra-sensitive.  Step 4 (\"Mix-ins\"): I went with masago, tomato, cilantro, mango, red onion. Other options include cucumber, lettuce, pineapple, and organic tofu. After this step, the employee will mix by hand the items from steps 3 through 4 (including sauce), so all of these get coated in sauces before being transferred to your actual bowl.  Step 5 (\"Toppings\"): I can see why some of these are separate, but I wouldn't have minded others being mixed evenly. I picked green onion, roasted garlic, tamago, kizami nori (shredded seaweed; note that they add a whole piece of nori to the bowl at the end anyway), corn, and tobiko. I probably should've added shredded bonito, and other toppings included jalapeno, crispy onion, sea salt, and ginger.  Then it's cash register time, where they'll place your bowl on a tray. They also offered a small complimentary miso soup, which was actually pretty delicious and not too salty, and pointed out some free drinks on the side including something slightly bitter made from burdock root, a so-called jasmine tea that was really just weak tea, and a roasted corn drink that somewhat resembles barley tea and which I easily chose after quickly taste-testing them all.  My poke bowl was just thoroughly delicious for whatever combination of reasons. Seasonings and sauces were certainly key, but all of the fish were fresh (albeit not necessarily high-quality) and weren't cut too finely as I've had at other places. The white rice isn't sushi rice, but it certainly was cooked properly. All of the assorted add-ons can be tasted individually and were also fresh.  My friend and I also tried the takoyaki ($3.99) out of curiosity. While it's advertised as 6 pieces, it's more like 8 half-pieces, and it oddly appeared to have been cooked after being sliced. They were crunchy and I found my tako reasonably tender, although the texture of the filling was a little overcooked compared to what I've eaten elsewhere.  Poke Poku is a little pricey, but their main product is the best I've had in its genre. I've been trying to evaluate this form of restaurant on its own merits, rather than directly compared to sushi or traditional poke, and I've found none better. I should also disclaim that I've only just started trying to trick out poke bowls fully to my liking, but this was superior to two places where I've fully customized my bowls.  P.S. I'm eagerly awaiting the opportunity to try their food again closer to Henderson. They're aiming for a Feb. 2016 opening on Eastern Avenue in the EOS Fitness / Monta Chaya plaza.",

Not only this place is a little pricey but it beats other places Becuase they offer shrimp tempura on their sides.  Most of the toppings were unlimited. Just a little downfall they didn't have white tuna but that's okay. I will be a regular here at Poku since their portion is huge.  Free miso soup when you dine in as well !!",

I kept asking him where the health grade was posted and he just kept saying \"it's over there\" and wouldn't point it out (they were hiding it behind the rice container). I asked him what the grade was and he wouldn't answer me. Since this guy wouldn't help me...I Then I asked the cashier (guy with the beard) and he closed the rice container to reveal the C grade. I asked him why they had a C and he said he wasn't there when they came in. This is super concerning since it's raw fish. I will be reporting them for not displaying their Heath grade due to the first guy I talked to being extremely rude and being deceitful about their low grade. Also, just an FYI the Henderson location has had C grades several times and actually was on dirty dining.",

Now down to the good stuff, the poke was definitely fresh  with a mix of some ahi tuna, salmon, spicy tuna, and the sauce mix I chose was their signature poke paku which had a little kick in it (just how I like it). I wouldn't say it's the absolute best poke I've had, but it's definitely a great, clean environment, with good staff.

Many are just average to be honest between Soulfish Poke and Tail Fin etc. Depends on the day you go how fresh the fish tastes and for spending  $10 base plus on bowls I was always annoyed the amount of upcharges and how stingy these places are with non existent basic portions whether protein or veggies. I don't eat out often but love healthy spots that are quality among give you value for your money. This place is it. I had never heard of Poke Poku until I was randomly in the AutoZone in this new plaza as I live in the SW. I have passed it so many times but just one of those places you don't see and have never heard it mentioned. The staff was polite and not trying to rush through my order as all too many places do among love all their food options and desserts. This has hands down become by go to Poke place and one of the handful of places like Skinny Fats and Greens/Proteins I will have in my arsenal for delicious but healthy options when I'm not cooking. Can't recommend it enough. I prefer this SW location as I live in mountains edge among it being a more spacious and little island getaway compared to their Eastern spot which I work near. Don't hesitate if not for the seared albacore and avocado included options alone Lol! A+++",

Their fish is so fresh, they have such a great variety of toppings and mixins, and their sauces are just out of this world. I've tried their signature Poke Poku sauce, Hawaiian, and Japanese style and they're all just so delicious!",

    "text": "I ordered delivery from Poke Poku, through Yelp Eat24. I've never been to the restaurant in person.  I love poke, when it's made fresh and to order. No grocery slop that may have been sitting, dressed, for up to two days, yuch. I've only ordered from this establishment once, and I've only ordered two things, but the bowl was so extraordinarily good that I had to comment.  What I had: TAKOYAKI: A bit disappointing, but not surprising, considering that most Asian establishments in this town don't do it right. I may be overly critical; not only did I learn to eat TAKOYAKI when I lived in Japan, I lived in Osaka, the takoyaki capital. So I didn't subtract any stars   MEDIUM POKE BOWL: I don't really need to note the particular ingredients I chose for my bowl, save to say that everything was fresh and flavorful. You build your bowl from the bottom up, according to your taste, and the options are numerous! The tuna, while not prime quality ahi, was decent and cut bite-sized enough to cover any inherent flaws, like sinews. If you ordered the same amount of maguro nigiri at a sushi restaurant, you'd probably pay $80 and not get anything but the sushi; this bowl was only $13 and was delicious and full of extra yummies. Small and large bowls are available, too, to suit the size of your appetite.  The restaurant also offers poke salads, in case rice isn't, well, your bowl of rice. And sushi burritos, too, whatever THEY are (yes, I'm a genuine sushi snob!). I didn't see misoshiru on the menu, perhaps my eyes just passed it by.  I may not review this establishment again, but I will certainly order from here, again and again!",

But the workers were very nice, albeit a bit tired looking. For the five dollar deal you're able to get a sushi burrito (1scp), mochi ice cream, miso soup, and \"healthy water,\" which basically means the barley, corn, and jasmine teas at the corner of the store.

She said it's a burrito? I don't know what you're talking about... of course I could see that it was a burrito, then I had to go into further details asking what ingredients she used. I feel like she could have used better verbiage and could have been more pleasant other than using a tone that made me feel stupid. I almost wanted to leave at that point, but decided to stay. Then a different girl helped me make my bowl. I told her it was my first time. She started off great asking if I wanted brown or white rice. Then she asked which side I'd like and let me taste the spicy crab. She didn't explain all the sides, I just assumed they were the ones that were open. Toward the middle of the process she asked what mix ins I'd like with my protein choice, and I asked if they had avocado. She said yes we do, but it's a side. I asked her where it was because I couldn't see it. She was like oh it's over here and it's covered.  You can get that next time you come, or if you want it now, it'll be an extra dollar. She never explained all the sides to me after I explained I was a first time customer. I asked if there was a way I could have the avocado instead and she picked the crab off and put the avocado on instead. After she switched out my side, she mixed my protein choice with mix ins and left without excusing herself. Then some guy ended up taking over my order. I just feel like the service felt a little off. Other than the service, again, the food tasted amazing. Prices I feel are a little high. I paid $11 for an extra small bowl.",

And last and most importantly, the young man making my bowl must have been new.  He didn't ask if I wanted furikake on my rice.  I asked for it and ponzu sauce on my rice.  The scoops of crab were skimpy and the scoop of tuna was less than half full. I come in here often and this was the first time that I feel like I didn't get my money's worth. So sad!",

I ordered a large poke salad. 2 scoops tuna 1 yellowtail and 1 salmon with seaweed salad, crab meat, etc. I got my order and it one had rice in it (i could excuse the rice btw i just wont eat it) but you gave me spicy everything! Spicy Crab meat and spicy tuna with no seaweed salad. It's inedible for me at this point because one I cant eat rice and two i can't eat very spicy things because I have stomach ulcers. Theres barely any greens and nothing much for me to eat at all.. i got half a refund from postmates for this but with how little i could actually eat of it it wasnt worth the remainder amount I paid. Again i could excuse the rice but i dont understand how my order was messed up this bad.",

I'm so glad I finally decided to try this one though because it is now my favorite! The setup is pretty much the same as other spots. You choose a bowl size or you can do a burrito. Then you choose some sides, some protein, and unlimited toppings. What I liked the most was the sauce selections. The portions are also very good. The small gets two large scoops of protein for about $10.   Staff was super friendly and the hawaiian themed decor is very cute. My new favorite poke joint!",

Clean, with a lot of seating. I like how they have lunch specials like a poke burrito which I got for $6. Prices here are a bit higher than other places. I think a medium bowl with 3 scoops was around $11-12 which is the same price as a large bowl else where. While the fish looked fresh, they didn't have that many options for toppings.   I got my salmon burrito to go. I liked how they have a machine that automatically makes a rice sheet with a push of a button! But... I did find hair in my rice. I also think they should have avocado slices so that the avocado mash doesn't make the burrito mushy. My fish was unevenly distributed so on one half of my burrito, there were only 3 pieces of salmon and the other half had the majority. The burrito is a bit smaller than other places as well... not sure if thats due to the lack of topping choices so I only chose cucumber, onions, crab meat and avocado with my salmon.",

I'm kind of an addict to the point where I've actually gone through four loyalty stamp cards (buy 10 get one free), and just got the 7th stamp on my 5th card. I discovered this restaurant in October 2018. So, you get it. The reason I cannot bring myself to give Poke Poku four, or even five stars, is that the customer service is okay, and seriously, they are always out of avocados, like, ALWAYS; and I'm not talking about after the lunch rush either. I realize that's an expensive ingredient, so if you're always \"out\", just take it off the menu. So, all-in-all, yes, I enjoy the poke bowls here, but I'd enjoy it so much more if my favorite ingredient was kept in-stock. A small bowl is definitely more than enough food for one person.",

Issue #1 - it took 20 Mins for 2 employees to serve 4 customers that were before me. I mean come on it's not a social hour want to chitchat do it outside of work. Issue #2- the guy that was behind the counter nicely took his hat of ran his fingers through his hair then continued to carry a convo about his hair and how he needs a hair cut. I mean gross. You're working with food. Especially raw fish. I don't want any of those or any germs in my food. Keep going- after he was done helping the customers instead of taking the next customer he gets on his phone to call his \"boss\" all while behind the counter. ( should apologize to the people that have been waiting now for 25-30 Mins and go to the back if you're going to get on your phone with a long line of annoyed customers waiting)  Ok so finally he gets off the phone serves a person in front of me. Yes he washed his hands but pay attention to this - Instead of using a paper towel or something to dry his hands he wipes them on his shirt. Disgusting.  So finally it was my turn. ( not with him but the girl that had gloves on and was somewhat appropriately doing her job) - I ordered a burrito- wanted yellowtail for my protein. She informs me they're out. So basically I wasted 30 mins of my time for nothing.   Never coming back to this place again. Guys if you need to get poke go to sweet poke down the street on rainbow and windmill- great customer service and the cleanliness of the location and it's employees isn't questionable.  Shame on you Poke POKU.   Sincerely,  Pissed off customer.",

    "text": "I have practically been a regular at this Poke Poku location since they opened their doors. Unfortunately, their service has gone completely downhill. What used to be a welcome and enjoyable weekly experience was completely ruined last night when my family and a guest from out of town went in to place our orders. The entire experience was unacceptable, and we regret not walking out when we had the chance. Even worse, the place that we had raved about to our guest was not at all representative of what it used to be.  The workers (all of which were new faces that we weren't familiar with) were undeniably rude. They spent more time carrying a conversation with each other than they did paying attention to their paying customers. When I ordered an extra small bowl, I was told that I was only allowed one side, when just last week I was told that I could pick two. Nowhere was it explicitly stated that an extra small only comes with one side. Additionally, when we asked for an extra side, we were met with irritated sighs because it's apparently such a chore to add that to our purchase total. The workers saw fit to rush us through the process of creating our bowls, but weren't actually attentive when we spoke. Our guest didn't even have time to order exactly what she wanted because the worker was being so rude. She missed out on the soft shell crab, and after she tried some of mine, she was livid that the worker who \"helped\" her had ruined her experience and didn't take the time to walk her through the steps of building her bowl as a new customer. We ordered 6 bowls altogether, and when they asked if we (as customers) were a group and if we planned on paying together, we were met with more rude and irritated attitude. Once we completed our purchase, the worker had the audacity to ask if we needed bags for our SIX bowls. Furthermore, the restaurant was nowhere near as clean as it used to be with the previous workers that we knew and were familiar with. There were at least four people working, and yet there was trash piled up, the bar was covered in spilled sauce, one of the menu screens was broken, and the workers made audible jokes about how the floor was sticky behind the counter. Also, one of the workers saw fit to use explicit language right in front of customers with children. My family loves the food here, but I'm sad to say that our favorite spot for poke is a thing of the past. We'll try our luck at the Eastern location, but we won't be returning here.",

We came during weekend lunch and it wasn't busy, couldn't order the specials since it was only for weekday specials.   The employees were nice and friendly. I got a poke bowl with half salad half brown rice! Topped it up with almost everything they offered. The fish were really fresh. The many different type of sauces gets really confusing. I just mixed like 5 together, and it tasted pretty good!   The free brewed tea for eating in was really interesting! Could taste the infused barley, and corn.   The poke bowl had so many flavours, so many toppings, I was like in heaven. Each bite was a new experience with different flavours depending on the toppings on my spoon.   I wanted to come back the next day, but was flying out already :(  Can't wait to come back!   I forgot to use the yelp check in discount! Was too overwhelmed with excitement when I first went in!",

The burrito itself is small compared to other places but not bad for $5. I'm the burrito itself was delicious. Fish was fresh and it had great flavor.

I simultaneously looked up their reviews on yelp and was assured by their 4.5 star rating that my decision was good so far. Looking at their menu was amazing.They offer sooooo much more then the normal poke places I frequent out in Cali.  They have Tobiko, Tamago, Bonito, Snapper, Soft shell crab, and a few others. Anywho, I ordered through postmates and could wait to try. 40 minutes later my postmate driver delivered to the wrong house and I never got my dinner. I quickly got a credit through postmates and decided to order my large poke powl again. (White rice, 4 fish (salmon, double scallops, and spicy tuna) spicy crab meat, seaweed salad, green onion, garlic, cucs, ginger, wasabi, jalapeno, tamago, furikake and a few other, the kitchen sink basically. Lol. New postmate driver found my house and dropped off my bowl. Side note: I had put in the special instructions on postmates that my original order was never delivered as an fyi. I opened my bag and there was a note from the staff that put my order together on my bowl. It said \"sorry about the delivery mishap, hope you got a refund. I added an extra scoop of salmon for you\". How cool is that? Major points and so courteous. Customer service was next level. I called to thank them and the lady told me it was a worker by the name of Steven I believe. You guys rock. Oh, and the ingredients in this bowl were unbelievably fresh. The rice was a lil warm and not cold and dry like the other poke places. Everything was perfect. Please go get this food. Especially the location on Rainbow Blvd. I know I'll be back again next time I visit.",

I think it's all about the choices and amounts of fish.  Monkey usual was a Medium bowl(3 proteins) with half brown rice half salad, soft shell crab, double Salmon, Korean sauce and all the fixins. Now sans the rice, a Medium Salad is a huge box of greens plus all the above.   Friends who have tried other Poke joints and disliked Poke overall because of them, changed their tunes here. You're welcome. This my go to spot for Poke. I don't want it anywhere else. Poke Poku nailed down the value in its pricing, punch card and free delicious teas while dining in. Staff is always friendly, patient and kind. Great environment.   Monkey do often.",

(Tuesday,8-22-17, approx. 7:15 in the evening). I informed her I was a vegetarian, and she said she was actually vegan, and she could help me with ordering my burrito. I told the last girl when I was there that I was a strict vegetarian (and no fish or seafood) and she didn't bother to tell me that the sauce I ordered contained fish eggs. (Found that out tonight when this lovely young lady informed me). She was patient with me, and even let me know that some items were fried in the same oil/vat as the shrimp tempura, etc. She made sure my burrito was full to my liking (since basically everything in it was vegetables) and was super friendly. I don't know why I never think to get people's names when I'm complimenting them until after I've left, and this case is no exception. Wish I'd have gotten her name in case a manager or owner reads this review.",

You get a base, 2 sides, 2 proteins, 5 items to mix in and 12 different toppings.  On top of this culinary creation you get an option of 9 different sauces from around the world to further enhance your taste buds.  I used the Korean sauce using a spicy chili sauce called gochujang.  Apparently this restaurant started in Hawaii, opened up some in LA and now are opening up multiple locations here in vegas.  The gentleman behind the bar was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  He made suggestions which turned out to be very helpful and crazy tasty.  Will be back soon.  This is real Poke",

Oh my! Forget that noise! They pile it high give you extra yummy topping choices in place of your proteins and they have tofu!!!! YUMMY!!!!!! Now after writing this review I don't care that it's almost 8 at night I'm ordering in some Poke Poku!!! Woot Woot!!! I may have a mild addiction!

They even let you try out the sauces and combination sauces if you have any questions about them.  You essentially make your own bowl similar to Chipotle. First you choose your base-white rice, brown rice, greens, or half and half. Then you choose your sides, choice of protein, toppings, and sauce. There are preset combination sauces that have already been concocted for you. Feel free to ask the worker which sauce goes best with the items that you have chosen. The restaurant is decorated Hawaiian style with lei and umbrella decor with ample seating. There is even a small kiddie table for the kids to sit at! Three different kinds of complimentary tea is served. Definitely coming back here again and again!",

Also, free Miso Soup and they have the best mango soda that I bought extras to take home with me.  This place is the gold standard.  I have traveled across the whole country stopping at every Poke place I saw or was within driving distance too (I LOVE IT) and this place was just the best.  I hope it becomes a far reaching chain.

    "text": "I do quite like this place. I've only gotten the sushi burritos from there, so I don't really know much about the rest of the menu. So when you go, expect loud music and cold chairs. That's probably the only things I would change. Oh wait, I forgot about the inconsistency of the sizes of the burritos too. I tend to get something similar each time, but the sizes can vary to \"eh, I'm still a bit hungry\" to \"oh-ho-hooo this thing is so thicc (WITH TWO C'S) I don't think I can finish this!\".   The quality of the fish itself is pretty good. They tend to be cut in smaller pieces so you get a better ratio throughout. Something I want to try though is to ask them to mix the seaweed salad in with the bowl that they  mix the sauces, toppings, and fish in. I need to keep that in mind for next time I go. The amount of choices you get is pretty good as well. You have the option for brown or white rice, you can do a sushi cheeto burrito (hot or original, I recommend the original), and you have a nice spread of things you can toss in there as well. They do have tamago, but they won't stick it in the burrito. Completely understandable because you wouldn't be able to close it at all.  Something else I like about this place is their free water station. I remember a barley tea and a roasted corn water, but I'm pretty sure there are one or two more. I think it's a nice thing to add on since soda can be too heavy of a drink to go with the meals they provide. They have reasonable lunch specials and if you eat in you get free miso soup. I will never argue with free. Every once in a while they will have promotions they show on Facebook where they'll  include some dessert of some sort or another appetizer with the meal. It's pretty cool. I'm looking forward to their new location in the NW side of town!",

It is a little pricier compared to their competitors in the same area. The toppings are pretty limited to only a couple things and then you gotta pay $1 or something per extra topping. This is what makes it more expensive. For the same price, you can get unlimited toppings at the other Poke shops on the same block.   Spicy Crab meat tasted too Mayonaisse-y.  I'd come back again for their fresh ahi.",

Just stopped in for the first time last night! I'm beyond impressed! Beautifully designed, extremely personable and helpful staff, lots of specials.  Their approach to creating poke bowls are unique and stand out in comparison to the typical build your own poke bowls/sushi burritos all over town (you'll have to just head over and see for yourself what I'm talking about). Their portions are huge (ordered a medium and barely made a dent in mine), quality of food is great (their brown rice was cooked to perfection which surprisingly a lot of people get wrong and their sauces actually had great flavor! I find a lot of places sauces to be super bland), got a free miso soup for dining in (which was so yummy), and they even have freshly brewed herbal iced teas COMPLIMENTARY that are so amazing!! I had the jasmine tea.  Unfortunately they're located in a somewhat out of sight view and not so noticeable if you were to pass by. Hoping the word of mouth with bring this great place some business!  Thanks to the staff for making our first visit so great! We'll definitely be back!",

I can't imagine ever needing a large size. The fish has always been fresh and delicious. The sauces are great.   The poke bowls here are the best I've found in Las Vegas, and easily on par (or better) than places I've been to in Seattle (where I first started trying poke bowls). They also have a stamp card you can get to earn a free poke bowl (after 10 stamps).   Of the 20+ bowls I've eaten from here I've had two misfires. Once, the rice was stale. Another time the sauce tasted off, for whatever reason. Even with the misfires the poke bowls were still good, just not usual amazingness that I had come to expect.   Really, my only complaint here is that sometimes there will be a line of people which can end up taking 15-20 minutes to clear through. I usually come by during lunch and don't have 20 minutes to burn standing in line. They need to figure out a better system to crank through customers when it is busy. If they can nail that, this place would be perfect.",

I'm not a Poke expert by any means, but I believe this spot gave me the will to become one...I know, sounds cheesy lol.   Seriously, everything was delicious! I tried a rice bowl with half and half white and brown rice with 3 scoops protein: yellowtail, salmon, and spicy tuna with the LA style sauce. For the sides/toppings I chose: spicy crab, seaweed salad, the sweet egg patty (forgot the name), roasted garlic, red onion, red and orange fish eggs, green onion, futikake, seaweed strips, tomato, mango, and probably some other stuff I can't recall. They have so many tasty options and everything is fresh and prepared right in front of you. I also ordered a Spicy Ramen and the steamed Dumplings which were both on special for $4.99! Both very hot and tasty as well :) I know it sounds like I really pigged out, but really, I DID! Although I shared my ramen and dumplings, I still could not manage to finish my medium bowl because they really do load it up. I had enough leftovers for a snack the following day, so that's always exciting! The food is absolutely excellent, the employees are friendly, the atmosphere has a positive vibe, it's clean, and they offer free Jasmin, barley, and corn tea. I can't wait to go back again!  UPDATE 06/09: Came in for late night dinner. I noticed that I didn't get a little stamp card the first time I came in, so I asked Ralph if they could stamp my new card for last time I went in and he was totally cool with it! Once you get 10 stamper-oos you get a medium poke bowl for $0!! Thanks for being so chill, Ralph! Awesome customer service!   Also, I just noticed that they advertise coupons on the back of Smith's grocery receipts so be sure to keep an eye out!",

    "text": "My 3 year old and I dinned in last night and as usual  my poke bow was amazing! I've never had a bad experience with a bowl or salad. The downfall is that a few changes have been made and even though the price dropped the large bowl is 3 scoops of fish instead of the 4 it used to be.   What continues to make me sad is that they don't offer any sauce with any of their fried items. I come here purposely because my kid likes the fried stuff but he also likes sauce and I don't know of anywhere else that serves calamari without a sauce. Odd.   Lastly, while we were dining in the music wasn't the edited version. F bombs were blaring away. Luckily my kid didn't notice and the parents with a younger kid behind me didn't seem to notice either but eventually someone will make a big stink about this.   I'll keep coming back but I'll be ordering to go and possibly won't be ordering the fried food",

I chose to have mine tossed with no sauce, cause I don't like my fish to be saucy, then topped it off with some random stuff. Got soy sauce on the side. IT WAS GREAT! They were big portions! And I was stuffed! There are a lot of toppings to chose from to be tossed with the fishes and then top your bowl off.  Environment The restaurant was on a strip plaza. Easy to find. There is a ice cream place next door, great way to end the meal! If its your first time, you may need to take your time to read the menu, but it is very simple. There is specialty sauces they have that they will toss with your fish, but you are always welcome to mix your own stuff together! Your choice! There is teas to the side that are free! Barley, Jasmine and regular.  Niceness of Staff She was really really nice. It was my first time there and she took the time to explain things to me. I decided to do the bowl but because I wanted vegetables, she recommended I do the salad plate so it holds more! Yay! Thanks for the help!  Dollar $ I would consider this very inexpensive and tasty. Especially for fish, it is hard to get good quality for a reasonable price. I am definitely happy with the meal!  Yes? Absolutely! I would definitely go here again. Especially if I am trying not to eat rice, these are the salads I rather have!   #WendyTakesVegas #WendyWanders",

Not only do they serve poke bowls but like every other poke place you can turn it into a burrito or salad bowl. They have items like hot Cheetos burrito, ramen, takoyaki, gyoza..the list goes on.   Now what I like to do when I order from here is order a Small bowl with rice then add extra protein. It's extra but who doesn't want more fish. Fish is pretty fresh from the looks and taste of it whenever I've gone in. They also have so many add-ons to choose from as well as pre-made sauces to go into your poke bowl/burrito/salad.   They also offer a variety of teas to go with your meal. Free of charge! Corn tea was interesting. But I prefer the barley.   It's located in the same plaza as Good Will and is next to the Dollar Tree. Don't forget to ask for your miso soup when you dine-in. Another plus is that they have punch cards :)",

    "text": "Poke poku has great quality fish. It's fresh and cut in larger pieces so it's similar to Hawaiian poke. It's a poke bar so you can pick and chose what you want in your bowl or burrito. They give you options of white or brown rice or salad and you can top it with anything you want.   For my burrito I got it with salmon and yellowtail and tossed it in the poke poku sauce. It's their signature sauce but they have a bunch of different options as well. I topped mine with cucumbers spicy crab, avocado, corn and Masago. The flavors were spot on.  They also put fried garlic and furikake on top of the rice so it adds great flavor and texture.   I can't wait to go back and try the bowls!",

    "text": "I got a few missed call from my friend Leo. So I texted him asking \"what's up?\"  Turns out he wanted to know if I have had lunch already.  It was like 2pm, but I managed to miss lunch while studying for a TAM card exam, plus procrastinating on Facebook and also watched a few Tasty Japan videos.   Apparently it is also Poke Poku's One Year Anniversary and they are offering complimentary appetizer sampler and dessert with your entree order all day this weekend (Oct 21 & 22).  Sounds good to me!  I love having foodie friends that help keep me in the loop for these promos.  And if you check-in on Facebook, you get 10% off your order.  Mochi Ice Cream Free - Green Tea or Red Bean (I suggest you eat this first, mine was melted by the time I finished my large poke salad) 3pcs of Goyza Free 3pcs of Shrimp Shumai Free 5pcs of Calamari Free Miso Soup Free (Dine-in Only) And Healthy Water- always on the house (3 varieties of iced brewed tea)  As far as Poke goes, it is NOT traditional Hawaiian style, in spite of the restaurant's name. Brah, if that is exactly what you're craving for, then you will be disappointed. Come on, even the Poke occasionally sold at select LV Costco locations are more authentic. No stink talk intended. Just laying some truth. I will also not say SoCal or Korean fusion version of Poke are not also grinds. (double negatives, so it is GRINDS!) Actually it is quite popular on the West Coast and made its way to Las Vegas.  In fact there seems to be a \"Poke\" bowl or sushi burrito eatery open on every block in this SW part of town.  While waiting for the 4 people ahead of me in line placing their orders, I distracted myself posting pictures to Instagram Story and snapping a few more pictures for Yelp and Facebook check-in.  Leo said I waited a long time, but I didn't really noticed.  And I also did not utilized my time more wisely studying the menu, so I ended up ordering a large salad and then haphazardly picked the other items (I don't want to be that guy taking forever with the order and pissing off the people patiently waiting behind me) to complete my order.  So ended up with the following mad creation: (Step 1) Mixed Salad (Step 2) Seaweed Salad + Fried Shrimp Tempura (pass on this next time) (Step 3) Salmon + Scallop + Yellowtail + Seared Albacore (Step 4) Everything (but they skipped on the Pineapple, Mango and Organic Tofu) (Step 5) Everything, except Jalapeno + Sea Salt And for someone that does not particularly like spicy food, I went with Gangster Style for the Sauce option (Sesame Oil + Spicy Chili + Sriracha + Spicy Chili +  Spicy Chili + Spicy Chili). Next time I will be sure to read the menu first than survey the premises with keepsake photos.   Anyway, the portion is generous and although I paid $13.15 for a large salad (with the 10% FB check-in discount), I still felt it was a reasonable deal. Plus they gave me a fried appetizer sampler and Mochi Ice Cream to celebrate their One Year Anniversary.   Today may be my first visit, but for sure it will not be the last.  I still have 9 more sauces to try.  So HAAAAPPPPY One Year ANNIVERSARY POKE POKU!!! And best of luck in the opening of the next two locations in the Ninth Island.",

The food is still good, but none of the old employees work there anymore and all the new faces completely ruined it for me.   1. I waited in line for 25 minutes before they could even take my order. 2. The new guy helping me (I didn't get his name) couldn't even ask me what I wanted in my poke bowl. For instance, when it came to my choice of protein, he would look at the protein choices then make eye contact with me and expect me to understand that he's asking me what I wanted (he did this several times before I actually understood what he meant) Are you really that lazy to even speak to your customers? 3. Before putting his mixing gloves on, this same guy above accidentally got his bare hand in my protein with sauce already in it and had the nerve to ask me if I was okay with that and if he can continue on mixing my food. Not once have I seen you wash your hands. You honestly think I'm just going to assume your hands are clean and accept food you got your bare hand in? 4. The entire restaurant is a disaster nowadays. I've been in multiple times these past few weeks and all the tables are dirty, sticky, and the floors have food all over it.  It's really sad to see my favorite poke place fall apart.",

I wish i got her name! But she made my order absolutely perfect! Not too much rice with furikake. I requested tuna with NewYork Sauce along with scallop with spicy mayo for my protein. I appreciate that she was very diligent and precise. She even asked if i wanted it to be mixed in different bowls and if it would be ok if she used the same gloves. That i appreciated even though i did not mind at all. Shrimp tempura, and crab meat on the side. I also like that they give u small sheets of nori if you wanted to make a hand-roll. Mini miso soup for dine-in only!   I had to knock off a star because a small was already $9.50 and it is small, of course additional add ons are $1.50 or so.. it does definitely add up.",

They have this vanilla ice cream sandwich that they advertised outside and i asked the lady for one and she looked so clueless, she said that they dont have that here and really made me look stupid. they also have a really small cup of miso soup for free,which is nice, but the quality of it makes it not worth getting.  Pros- the interior design is wonderful and i really enjoy the Hawaiian vibe they have going here! Even though the choices arent alot the bowl tasted really good and would totally recommend!",

Most are all that will fit, so very generous here.  A great aspect are the various flavor combinations of special sauces. The proteins are left alone for you to mix or jusr eat and choose as you go.

    "text": "So been meaning to try Poke Poku out for sometime. I had feeling was not more of your traditional True 808 poke but more of the new trendy style of build your own bowl then pick your protein, sauce, and toppings. I truly have no problem with especially when your starving from a post long run and craving raw fish and rice. lol!!! Hawaiian they definitely have that theme down from the minute you walked into the restaurant. It got the island vibe the only thing missing is local hawaiian station. I appreciated that they were playing current music in the restaurant.   It was my first time so went with the Poke large bowl/ I got three different proteins one spicy tuna, salmon, and albacore. My toppings tried not to go crazy. Nothing worst then overkill and takes away from the fish. True Poke never about the sauce but the fish quality. I feel the quality is good at Poke Poku. The sauce went with the LA sauce. It tasted basically like spicy tuna sauce you would get in sushi I felt. Good. The portion size feel like your not getting cheated at all for the money you pay. So many different toppings and options you really could go back everyday for week never get the exact same thing twice. They have nice options comes to beverages. They have refrigerator with different bottle and cans choose from and fresh made teas (three different ones). Not just Poke bowls I got order of gyoza. It was solid. The only thing odd was ask for gyoza sauce it doesn't come with one. They just started serving ramen noodles on the menu.   The service was five stars. The gentlemen making my bowl went over the steps being my first time. Friendly, attentive, and made my first experience great one.",

There wasn't really much flavor into anything even with the sauce mixed into it. I've had poke before and it was really good. There was something off about it that I couldn't pin point.   I gave it four stars because it was priced well, healthy, and the service was great. I'm sure if I tried mixing in different ingredients, it would be much better than what I got.

If you ever dine in, you also get free miso soup and a selection of free drinks. Albeit so, the drinks are not very great, but it's still a nice gesture for it being free.

    "text": "I have always loved poke, and lately I have been craving it. Too bad Poke Poku is so far from my house, because otherwise I would be visiting this place twice a week. And even at that rate, it would take years to sample all the available permutations.  Poke Poku is set up like Subway or Chipotle, where you stand behind the glass and tell the server what you would like out of an assortment of ingredients. My husband and I both ordered medium bowls, which gave us each three scoops of protein. I had yellowtail, tuna, and salmon; and he had two scoops of tuna and a scoop of snapper. Next up comes two sides (seaweed salad [yum!] for both of us, with spicy crab for me and edamame for him). Then you choose your \"mix-ins\" (fruits and vegetables [cucumber, mango, onion, etc.]) and \"toppings\" (salts and spices [roasted garlic, ginger, tamago, etc.]). Last comes the sauce: I chose Hawaiian style (sesame oil, Sriracha, Aloha, and ponzu); and my husband had Japanese style (same as Hawaiian, but swap the Sriracha and Aloha with wasabi mayo). The server mixes these all in a bowl and serves them on your pre-ordered base. We both picked mixed greens, although you could also select rice (white, brown, or mixed) or baby kale (my first preference, although they were out of it when we were there).  As I said, there are thousands of possible combinations to try, but we were both pretty pleased with our choices. The fish was fresh, and the portions were plentiful. I just wish I could have tried the kale.  It's not fancy, but it's filling--and reasonably priced for freshly prepared fish (around $25 for two). So if you're in the mood for some island-style eats, pop on in to Poke Poku!",

They have different size bowls so you don't have to worry about getting too much or too little depending on how hungry you are at the time. The prices are good too for what you get.

The staff was very friendly. I didn't have the long wait that others have mentioned. The fish was reasonably fresh. Everything was just okay. The rice was okay. The fish was okay. The sauce was okay. (You can see where I'm going with this.) Where they did miss the mark is having the tornado potato advertised on tabletops and on the menu but not having it in stock. I was basically told not to hold my breath on it ever being available. But for $5 sushi burrito for lunch, I don't feel like I could complain.",

Perfect having cold teas as soon as you walk in and wait in line.  I've taken maybe 4 or 5 different friends here and they all agree. I've only had one bad experience, that they never told me they had stamp cards and I've already been there a dozen times. But that won't hurt your rating. For now, muahahaha. Jk :)",

    "text": "I love sushi. I love good-quality Poke even more. Poke is from Hawaii, and I am SOOOOOOOOO glad it's now taking over the mainland. It's like sushi, but not little nigiri or rolls, but in a bowl, with lots of yummy other stuff!! You can tailor make your bowl, so if you're not a fan of things like imitation crab, mayonnaise or cream cheese - which you sometimes get as a \"surprise\" in a sushi roll, you don't have to endure that. So overall, I'm a happy camper. This place is relatively well-priced for a good meal - obviously a bit pricier than going to McDonalds, but... it's a trade-off between health and a slightly higher price point. Medical bills are definitely more expensive in the long run. Side note, did you know that only 4% of the population of Japan is overweight? Some of the main parts of the Japanese diet are fish and seaweed. Makes you think, huh?",

Ingredients were all super fresh. Oh, and they walk you thru each step.  It seems over whelming, but they hold your hand on each step! Unlike the place down the street that has a lot of choices and it don't matter, you don't get what you want. Oh, and the other place down the street that looks nice and clean, but has sanitary issues.  Speaking of which - ALL employees here had face masks on - AND 1 or 2 pairs of gloves on at all times when near food.  Added bonus - Samsung wireless charging at the table.  Oh - and 3 types of \"water\" or tea -  yummmmmmmmmmmmmmyyyy and healthy.  Lunch specials are great - even if you upgrade.",

This location suffers from poor management and as a result the wait times are absurdly long. For example, I typed this entire review while maintaining my spot in line. Also played several races in Asphalt 9 and managed a good Reddit browsing session. So in total I've been standing in line for about thirty minutes.   Another mention about management is that the screens are almost always broken. Unless you've been here and ordered before, any newcomer would be adequately confused as they're missing step 3 and step 4 of their poke bowl building experience.  The soda machine has been left unassembled from last night's cleaning more than once. A lady just attempted to get soda and sprayed herself, and my shoes, with soda because of this.   There is clearly not enough staff. Five times I've come, the yellowtail is not prepared. The egg is not ready. The miss soup is not ready. In fact, right now as I'm writing this review, this poor girl has manned the entire front line completely by herself. From assembling to payments, she has been completely alone.   If it wasn't convenient and decent for the price. I would have given up on this location three visits ago. But I believe today to be my last here. Do not visit as they do not care for their employees and store. Please give your patronage to another more deserving store.",

I get a small because I still think it's a lot of food, especially for the price. I'll usually get brown rice and the mixed salad and some other stuff in my bowl include: spicy crab meat, seaweed salad, soft shell crab, tuna, tamago (my fave), nori, etc. I appreciate that they have a lot of different toppings, sides, proteins, and especially sauces to choose from! My favorite sauces are the poke POKU style or the LA style. Also, they do offer miso soup for those who dine in!",

The ingredients are all fresh, the staff are all friendly, and the price is just right. They charge around 12$ for a medium bowl which includes 3 scoops of protein and unlimited toppings. They also have so many different combinations of sauces that make the poke even more flavorful. I make my own sauce as a combination of a few of their sauces and it taste so delicious. I've tried both the tuna and salmon and both are great. They also make a pretty stellar spicy tuna option as well.  The sides that are my favorite are the seaweed salad and the shrimp tempura.   I would have given 5 stars but I am not a fan of the new Miso recipe at all. It has a lot of gunk at the bottom of the cup which isn't tasty at all.   One tip: go to Smiths and buy something before you go. They offer a 25% off coupon on the back of any Smith's receipt.",

Another 10 minutes behind the SAME PERSON I was behind earlier.  We ordered a medium poke bowl and a ramen. The ramen took 10 minutes to come out and was mediocre at best. The poke... oh my. The portions were awful. It was 60% rice 10% greens and 30% everything else. Also, they told me at the last second that they ran out of salmon. When I asked when they would have more they said \"we don't know\"... the albacore tasted weird.  They didn't know which sauce was which and took foreverrrrr to put the items in. Ahhhhh!!! I'm a visitor from California and won't be coming back here.",

In the last couple of months this place has gone down hill, and I actually had to walk out the last two times going. First they got dinged on their food grade and went down to a \"D\" which they were hiding the sign behind the rice cooker so no one would notice. Then the other times, I actually walked out because they were out of Salmon and tuna. Also they provide fresh tea for free which looked like it was out from the day before warm with no ice. They only have one employee serving lunch at lunch, so expect to wait 20 to 30 min to get your food.  Really wish this place would go back to their old ways.",

The first time I ate here I was non-stop ranting after every bite about how the fish was SO good. I absolutely recommend to anyone!

I came in during a busy time but they put in effort to serve all the customers in a timely manner. I ordered a small bowl and it was super filling. The sauces are so addicting haha. I've already eaten here many times and still end up going back to try their sauces. Not only is the food delicious but they give free miso soup (with organic tofu inside) when you dine in! The miso soup is the perfect touch to all the infused flavors. I also love their complementary teas. And don't even get me started on their macaroon icecream mmmm",

I got the medium bowl with all ahi tuna as always but this time I seen the gentlemen only scoop 2 scoop of protein. When I asked if he put 3 he said yes. When he passed on my bowl the lady was really nice but the gentleman kept taking the sauce she was about to use and mixing a small bowl. There was no one in line! Again when I was choosing my toppings he bumped his way over and started putting things in the mixing bowl so I waited again. Still no one in line.. When I got home I ate my bowl and I noticed that they shorted me. Now I'm thinking that he prolly ate my last scoop as a snack. When ordering beware and watch the amount of protein they put in your bowl.",

They literally pack the bowl to the top and they aren't skimpy with your bowls at all unlike other places!! They have fresh ahi tuna which is amazing and i appreciate how they tossed the tuna in sauces before adding them into the bowls! You get a lot of protein in the medium bowl and the toppings is AMAZING. This place is my all time favorite place to go for all my poke needs. The drive is a bit far from my house but it's so worth it. They have a big bar and you can pick and choose what you want in your bowls. Typically i get half and half but i got a full rice bowl here. This is my fave hawaiian poke joint!! They also have so many amazing toppings that other places don't offer as well. The place is fairly big and is always clean! They have a kid area and a drinking station while you wait as well! There's also a princess parking sign outside which is adorable!",

The girl (pink hair) mixed the sauce flawlessly making sure the AHI was completely covered. We moved into the additions and I went to town, I recommend the garlic. This is a must! I have never seen this in poke, this is what made the entire bowl stand out.   Everything about this bowl was fresh, and eloquently flavorful! This place has set my standards very high for the next poke place we eat at! Happy but sad! The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. They even came out to see how we liked it! Awesome!!!   I would highly recommend this restaurant again. I will be coming back next time in in Vegas! Fantastic!!!",

    "text": "Believe it or not, after all the years of the poke bowl craze. I had my first poke bowl late last year. And I'm so sad I had it at Poke Poku because I was in town visiting family and my sister and in law wanted me to try out this place.   Now, since then I've tried a few more poke places. And a good poke place are a few and far in between. That said, I have not come across any other place that compares to Poke Poku.   I would say they are a little pricey. I had a medium with 3 scoops and the scoops weren't that big. But overall, once it was finished with toppings and etc, it was a heavy bowl. The reason why I never tried poke bowls it because I don't like eating rice really (I know, I'm Asian) so I don't like eating rice with any raw fish especially. However I did not mind it. And it's probably cheaper if I ate rice instead of trying to get full from poke, which is impossible!   What I love about Poke Poku is their sauces and the many varieties they have. Their sauces are so darn tasty, I wanted to lick my bowl after I finished it. Many places have the simple spicy mayo, ponzu or shoyu but I'm a girl that craves for flavor. And they offer so many more different toppings (like literally!) compare to other poke places. I just love their variety. They have complimentary tea and miso soup for dining in. I make sure it's my first and last stop in Vegas.",

    "text": "Yum! Delicious poke bowls and the customer service was great. My friend and I informed them this was our first time here and the two workers (male and female) explained the menu and gave us suggestions when it came to our sauce concoctions.   A small size includes two scoops of protein and a medium have three. Our eyes were obviously bigger than our stomachs because we had leftovers with our medium bowls. Def getting a small next time. For my protein, I got two scoops of spicy tuna and a scoop of salmon. Had half salad and half brown rice. There's no limit on sides or sauces. It cost about $12something for a medium but they're super generous with their portions. You want extra jalapenos? Or two scoops of green onions? They gotchu covered.  Also, there's three different kinds of complimentary teas that benefits different areas of your health. This was enough to give them an automatic three stars alone....I haven't seen many places serves complimentary teas like that so big ups for POKE POKU. Whenever I'm craving for poke bowls again, I'm coming here.",

Every single table was dirty, the floor was dirty and the counter with the food was dirty. Trash was spilling out of the trash can.  They were not busy at all. The teenagers were busy flirting with each other, laughing and goofing around, eating behind the counter and on their cell phones. At one point one of the four employees went to sit with his three buddies who were in the restaurant finishing up eating. No gloves were worn when our food was put together. Only one employee wore a hat. Nobody else had a hat or t-shirt that the employees at Poke POKU normally wear.  I sure hope that the owner takes a serious look at the staff and supervises a little more and raises the standard back to the great place this place was.",

So imagine our surprise to find a dozen decent poke places here in Las Vegas and I must say this one is probably the best I've to.   Servings come in generous portions. You can definitely taste the freshness of the protein. Of course my all-time-fave is the spicy tuna. They also offer multiple options for toppings and sides which was pretty amazing. My usuals are mangoes, red onions and furikake.   Another good thing is the complimentary tea that they offer. If I'm not mistaken they have at least 3 options.   Servers are nice and pretty fast as well. I've been here only twice so far and there was always a line but they go by quick.   I honestly see myself coming here at least once a week that's how good it is.",

The only reason I only gave 4 stars is because one of the workers was on her phone while a ton of us were in line.

The door was open, open sign was not lit up, there was a man in line and a person unwrapping what looked like yesterday's left overs and putting them out. I waited for about 10 mins before I decided to ask the man in front of me if he had ordered. He said no, \"I guess this guy works in the back and non of the other workers showed up for work\". I should have left then but decided that since I've waited 15 mins so far what's a few more mins going to hurt. I also had my youngest with me that was begging me for potstickers (which he only likes from here.) I watched a few people walk in and out because the line was getting pretty long. When finally a gentleman showed up. He took his time walking in and checked his cell phone before greeting the guy in front of me.  I ordered my potstickers first since I know they have to be fried then my salad. The guy was nice behind the counter. He rang me up and then I preceded to wait another 20 minuets for potstickers. By the time I left it had been a hour that I spent waiting around at that location. To my surprise when we got home I didn't even get potstickers I got steamed dumplings and was never given back my stamp card. I found the owners email on Facebook and sent them a email while I was in the restaurant but have yet to receive a reply.   Flash forward to yesterday 5/30 at about 2:15....it seemed like their was a whole new staff working and nobody knew what was going on. Salad was empty and the girl told me were out!? Someone stopped her and told her to get more from the back. I ordered potstickers and they were out of stock. She said don't you mean dumplings I said no Gyoza and she was confused. Proceeded to order dumplings since the 2 girls mentioned them and they were out of those as well.   I really like food at this restaurant but the service has taken a turn for the worse. The fish has also been hit or miss with freshness. Lately it's been super fishy (probably because they are using fish from the day before that's been sitting out). Also, the soda dispenser has been broken for months and the prices are always sitting in a bowl of water on top of the soda drain I will most likely not be visiting this restaurant for a while.",

One worker was being so reckless that as she was stacking chairs on the tables (at 30min BEFORE they close), she broke off wood-chips from the table behind us and that fell into our drinks. She did not even notice how rude she was, especially since we were still eating. She kept on stacking chairs like no one was there.   The other girl took away the tea drinks around the same time, so we were basically out of drinks while they were still open. They also ran out of the miso soup, so it was pretty much False advertisement of free miso soup for dine-in. The workers also flipped the \"Open\" sign to \"Closed\" sign, 10min BEFORE they officially closed.   I hope these workers are reprimanded since this is not how customer service should be. If they want to clean up early, then the given close times at the door should be at 9:00pm instead of 10:00pm.",

I'm giving them a 1 star based on today's experience.    Shawn and Jelly were the two staff members behind the counter.  First, Jelly and Shawn don't like to wear gloves when they are working with food.  Disgusting. Shawn was serving me and was clearly having a very bad day. It doesn't appear that either of them actually enjoy working there.    The tables are sticky.  I sat in 3 places, all sticky.  The soda machine is broken and clearly has a sign on it \"out of order\". So I asked for a water.  Jelly instead of answering me decided to tell an employee in front of me.  Literally I asked for a water and she instead of answering me turned to the other employee and said there are water cups in the lobby.  So I grabbed a water cup and told them the water/soda machine has a sign on it that says Out Of Order. Shawn then informed me that the water side still works.  So I go to the to get water and it sprayed everywhere.  They took the spout off the machine and it sprayed everywhere.  When I went back to the front counter Shawn didn't even apologize.  I gave them my cup and grabbed a bunch of napkins to wipe all the spray off me.  He said nothing.  I just said \"I changed my mind\" and walked to my sticky table to eat my food.    If Shawn and Jelly continue to be here then I will not come back.  Sad was one of my favorite poke bowls. There is another place down the street I guess I'm going to try.",

This one became my favorite - I've filed 2 punch cards already and have recommended it to many friends, neighbors, and anyone looking for poke in the SW area.  Fish are fresh, lots of topping options, and many seasoning combinations to choose from (and you can add different ones for free).  You can make a bowl, burrito or salad.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  When they first opened, services was slower as staff was getting used to things. Over time, it has improved greatly.  They had many specials I was able to take advantage of - free miso soup when dining in, sometimes potstickers or mochi ice cream.  They offer freshly brewed teas for free. Pricing is reasonable and worth the amount they give.",

Food:  Both times I thought the food was just alright... not authentic Hawaiian by any means (the bf is from Hawaii so I've had my fair share of authentic poke), but if you're craving a poke bowl, this will suffice. They offer complimentary miso soup as well as teas (barley one is yum) with signs describing the benefits of each tea - pretty neat!   Pricing: A bit on the pricey side compared to ToSeeRoll which is close by on Rainbow.  Service: What really threw me off the second time I went was the customer service. The girls behind the counter were chatting it up and dancing to the music while taking my friend and I's orders. There was only one other customer in front of us when we arrived, and both of them were helping this one customer while we weren't even acknowledged. By the time they got to us, they were still chatting with each other and we had to wait for them to finish talking before they asked us about the next topping.   Overall: After the experience from our second visit, I don't think we'll be going back. There's much more poke options in the city that are authentic and provide better service.",

My favorite part was that my salmon pieces were CHUNKS. They were huge! The servers were nice and friendly, answering our questions and helping us decide on stuff. We also got the takoyaki which was yummmy! A huge bonus for us was the Bible verse written on the place mat.

I informed the lady about it and all she can say was \"sorry\". I asked for other sauce on the side and again she did not use all the listed ingredients on the board.

If you've had poke at Fresh Catch in Honolulu, or the fish market at Hilo, or even Safeway in Lahina, you'll find the offerings here a bit confusing. It's like a buffet -- make your own poke on the spot. The ingredients are all fresh and good, but I think poke benefits from a bit of time sitting and blending the ingredients.   The staff were completely clueless and the process is a bit arcane for a newcomer. There aren't any toro chips for the purists -- they serve the poke over rice or solo in a bowl.",

They also have lunch specials M-F where one of them you can get a sushi burrito and gyoza for $5.   For the food... Everything is so fresh! And it's soooo good.

Also, they didn't have any avocados and it was the only side that I was looking forward to getting.  Service on the other hand was alright. I didn't get a chance to catch their names, but this one Asian lady who was serving me toppings was very kind and welcoming. Although, the other worker who I assume is Caucasian wasn't so nice. I asked to sample one of their sauces, but without hesitation she rudely asked \"Are you even getting anything..\" I mean, I didn't just come to sample sauces. & I felt personally attacked because I am a big fan of poke, and seafood in general.

    "text": "First off let me start off by saying how cute this place is . Inside is super clean and well decorated. The menu is pretty simple step by step . You have the option of a bowl , salad or burrito . The one thing that has shocked me is portions size and quality of the fish . Most places I've tried have nearly diced the tuna or have the crappy smashed up tuna wich I hate . I got a combination of rice spicy crab meat and a portions consisted of tuna, salmon, and octopus. (All scoops were actual scoop size) then my toppings were the usual green onions and nothing too exciting . The sauce i did decide on was there house sauce the Poke poku sauce and it was a spicy mayo ish sauce with a kick . It was delicious. My boyfriend got a salad with all the same toppings as me and the Hawaiian sauce wich was amazing also. This place by far has been my favorite find near me ! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone on the southwest area near rainbow and 215 . They also give you a free miso soup for dine in costumers . I love miso soup but most places miso suck . This place on the other hand really surprised ! The gyoza also was delicious !",

We have been here twice and each time one of the owners was serving us. They really take pride in providing you with the best Poke bowl and experience. I get the half ahi and half fried soft shell  crab. Awe man talk about some of the best flavors ever. Also throw the gangsta sauce all of that bowl and you will thank me. Don't forget to add fresh jalapeno also. Love this place and it blows all of the others out of the water.",

Everything was clean and their restroom even has a bench in it which I took a picture and it smell clean and bathroom was clean. I even took pictures of it :-) You get complimentary tea and miso soup if you dine here. Of course I chose to dine here. I usually get food to go but this place made me want to eat here. They have outdoor seating but it was 110 degree outside when I went on Father's Day. This father brought his two daughters here and they sat at the little kids table which was the cutest thing ever. Servers were really nice here. The toppings here was fresh and plentiful. I loved the variety of choices. I got the small poke bowl with half rice and half salad. I loved that they give you this option cause I wanted the two options. They give you two sides, two proteins choices (freaking awesome because most places only give you one protein choice and then charge you crazy for other protein) and you get unlimited toppings and mix in choices. They don't charge you extra for masago or other toppings choices. I love this place! So lucky I stopped in here. I highly recommend this place.  P.S. bonus points for them because on their sheet tray it says \"I love you, lord, my strength psalm 18-1\" I just got done attending church and stopped here to eat right after church! If I could give this place 6 stars I would. The owner did an amazing job at this place!",

You get your protein you choose how you want your tuna sauced (they have sauce styles on the wall) and you can pick your toppings right after. The best part is the tea they provide are complimentary! Anyway the tuna is good here, I get scared to order tuna at restaurants because some places put in the chewy muscle (there were none thank goodness) so I enjoyed my tuna bowl.   I ordered a small bowl of rice for my son with 2 pieces of shrimp tempura. They were nice enough to accommodate my picky eating son.  Thank you!   It was a great experience, with good music. When you play Porter Robinson, EXO and Madeon it makes your surroundings even better :)   Our go to spot for poke",

Once i ate it though..OMG! The flavor!! The freshness!! I was beyond pleased!! And the small bowl looked deceiving because there was plenty of food in there for my full meal. My only complaints....the crab was a little too creamy and the forks are super flimsy!! Yes, those are my only complaints! Delicious and will have it again when I'm in the area!!",

Small bowls will run you around $9 and the large (too much for me to finish) approximately $14. If you're a first-timer, go medium sized, half and half (tuna/salmon), and go from there. The sauces we tried: Japanese and Hawaiian (a little bit spicy).   They've got the largest varieties of toppings of all the poke places I've visited and a loyalty program that rewards you after 10 or so purchases. Highly recommended.",

We've been enjoying Sweet Poke for a while but we decided to drive a little farther down the road to check out Poke Poku.  My girlfriend and I both got the \"small\" salad. America! The portion size was ample. The real difference in the sizes is how many scoops of seafood you get. Two is fine for us, especially since you get so much more along with it.  Cutting to the chase, this is another great poke option in the southwest area. I might ever so slightly favor this place over Sweet Poke thanks to having tobiko in the lineup. The employees were all friendly and helpful as we constructed our bowls. Actually, since we got salads, it's more like a plastic salad container, which I possibly prefer over Sweet Poke's bowls. (It seems like you do get a bowl if you get rice).",

You can get soft shell crab as an option. 2. If you want a small portion they have an extra small option. 3. Unlimited toppings 4. You can get yellowtail as an option.  Seriously the bowls are fresh and delicious.",

I've been to various places in the Southwest area and in random spots and none have as good toppings and other options as Poke Poku - it's quickly becoming my go-to for takeout in general.   The portions are very generous- I can barely finish the small size and when I tried the medium I had to save about half for later. They have a board with sauce mix suggestions which are good for those who are indecisive- my favorite is LA style (I ask for yuzu ponzu too for that sourness). The service has always been friendly as well and they have stamp cards. The only thing I dislike is that they play music extremely loudly so it's hard for them to hear me order (and I can't hear them well either). Other than that, Poke Poku is great.",

Each come with 1 scoop of protein and ate very filling so don't think it's never enough. I like trying different combos of proteins, mix-ins and toppings. Whatever you get, it's almost always going to be Instagrammable anyway so go crazy with your choices. Big fan of Hawaiian or Japanese style! Also, they have loyalty cards. Buy 9 get the 10th free!

    "text": "This poke place is among many that opened on rainbow last year. It is in the same plaza as goodwill. I've been to this establishment twice and the second time was just as good as the first.   Poke poku is similar to the other poke places in the way that it's a chipotle style way of ordering. I ordered a small bowl & that came with 2 scoops of protein. She pulled out the bowl & I thought to myself, \"wow. That is so small. How am I supposed to get full off of that...\" to my surprise, I could barely finish it. They really pack on the protein & the fix-ins! So the reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because of their shrimp tempura & soft-shell crab. I think it's great that the shrimp tempura isn't extra & you can just add it to your bowl, BUT when I tried it the first time I came here... it was horrible. It was cold & stale & not edible. I learned the second time I was here, but my friend got the soft shell crab & he made the same comments. I think they should really fix that.   The service here though is A1!! Will come back but probs not for the fried stuff lol.",

I opted for quick take-out of two medium Poke Bowls. THANK YOU for having octopus and scallops as protein options! Everything was fresh and oh-so-yummy. A great variety of sauces, toppings, sides, etc. that is sure to please any poke fans. A medium was more than enough and was under $13.

They play j-pop videos and I find myself always in a better mood by the time lunch is coming to an end.  So why the 3 stars? 2 reasons -  They advertise fresh avocado and even show it in their own marketing images but what they really offer is mashed avocado only. I'm not a fan of mashed avocado in my poke bowls plus I strongly feel that you should sell what you advertise. And the second reason is that the bowls are more expensive than their competitors by $3-$5 and there's tons of competition out there.  Pros: Complimentary miso soup (dine-in only) Complimentary teas (a variety of fun flavors) Fast & friendly service Build your own business model Lots of delicious toppings and sauces",

The concept is similar to others, with their Subway/Chipotle-style of customizing your order, as are their options. But, they do have items like soft shell crab, octopus, and scallops, which others do not. Also unique are their suggested combination of sauces like LA Style (sesame oil, spicy chili, aloha sauce, and sriracha), Korean Style (sesame oil, aloha sauce, Korean spicy chili), and Japanese Style (sesame oil, wasabi mayo, and ponzu).  Their medium bowl ($11.50) is slightly more expensive than other places, but my bowl consisting of brown rice, seaweed salad, crab meat, tuna, yellowtail, octopus, masago, red onion, cilantro, pineapple, crispy onion, roasted garlic, bonito, ginger, sesame oil, sriracha, ponzu, and aloha sauce was more than enough. The quality of their product was pretty good, but nothing stellar.  Complimentary beverages are available, too. Burdock root tea, roasted corn tea, and jasmine tea are all up for grabs. The roasted corn -- as strange as it sounds -- wasn't bad. It was basically like corn flavored water.",

What attracted me to this place was the fact that Poke Poku is a \"Hawaiian\" poke bar but I'm a little confused because nothing was really Hawaiian about this place. I don't think they got da kine here, da Hawaiian kine.   What do I expect from a place that calls themselves \"Hawaiian\"? I'm looking for friendly aloha vibes. Broke da mouth grindz.  Instead what I got was not so welcoming service, expensive/small portion and subpar food. Yes, I know poke is not the cheapest lunch. But compare to other poke options in town, this was the least amount of food I got for the price I paid.   I did enjoy the different sauce combinations they offered, as well as their unlimited topping options. I ordered their poke bowl with salmon and various toppings, then chose poke poku sauce to go with it. Sauce was good, and not overpowering as I expected it to be. Overall it was pretty average.  I must say as a tea enthusiast, their complimentary tea bar was the highlight of my visit. They have 3 different tea options and all teas are nice and refreshing.  For Hawaiian poke bar and True ono grindz, I prefer Paina cafe over this one.",

I would definitely come again whenever I'm in the neighborhood :)",

Poke Poku is consistently good and fresh, food items are always stocked and the complimentary miso and tea are a nice touch (hey people don't complain about price until you look at the whole pic here!) Only one complaint: would much prefer freshly sliced avocado over mushed. Maybe that's just me though bc I have the same complaint at Subway, as I LOVE me some fresh avocado - the yummy superfood!  You can't go wrong w the Poke Poku sauce or the LV Style sauce.  The girls working today - Sun afternoon - are both polite, efficient and hard working. (Asian girl w long braids and blonde w med length pony tail/forearm tat).  Don't be intimidated first trip if you have never been to Poke Poku, just let them know and they hopefully will walk you through the steps to building a bowl or a burrito - and if you're lucky you won't get the impatient guy I had the first time YEEESH.  Try the Coffee Macaron Ice Cream sandwich if you didn't fill up on a huge bowl. Mmmm!",

    "text": "If this is Hawaiian Poke, I'm a Russian Princess.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Rant: pineapple, mango, corn, siracha, ponzu, eel sauce.  No, no, no, no, no, no!  We don't put these things in our poke in Hawaii!!!  Stop calling it Hawaiian poke!  Don't even get me started on putting pineapples on pizza.  Grrrrr.  That said, what is offered is very good \"SoCal style\" poke bowls and wraps.  Keeping it real, the seafood is previously frozen but not gassed or treated with color additives.  All good, the norm.  Crab is imitation, AKA krab.  Rice is of average quality, Best when served warm. Veg is fresh. Finally sauces, bold, all with a nice sesame oil flavor, those containing ponzu, have good acidity making them refreshing.  Tip: pass on poke only.  Poor value at $22/lb.  Ordering is, well you know the drill. As a bowl or burrito (the bowl is better as the burrito is so stuffed it oozes out and falls apart).  Mix and match up to three proteins to satiate your hunger. It's your creation.  Unlimited toppings a plus.  Servings are generous.  Free miso soup (dine in only).  Look for check-in offers (10% off with yelp or Facebook check-in's as of this writing).  Extremely friendly and patient off strip service.  Novices need not to stress.  Solid and an A=OK place to grab a bowl.  Mango poke, sheesh...",

They definitely do go above and beyond with toppings and options, however their fish is sub-par. Personally, that is the most important part of a Poke dish.   Poke has become a big thing, and can be found everywhere now a days. Problem with that are places like these that don't give Poke the great name. Worst part is they still charge the same as the places that truly have the great fish and much better bowls.",

There was a line right when they opened and the girl that helped us seems PISSSEEEDDD OFF. Two groups left while standing in line. The girl didn't say hi to ANY of us and we truly felt like we were making her job a lot harder by being here. I don't know what is going on but management should either look into fixing the way they run things or train their employees a bit more because it's getting worst and worst every time I come. Everyone is looking at each other right now like the energy in this entire place is just so sooo heavy (I'm assuming that's why the two groups left.) I said thank you twice, the girl didn't say anything, then I yelled \"THANK YOU\" one more time and finally she said, but out of the 8 separate groups of people I saw in line, not once did she do a \"hi how are you?\" And \"Thank you! Have a nice day!\" I completely get the people have bad days but to come into work and let that energy reap the entire room, that's not good business practices",

Usually when I go to poke places I get a large because for some reason I'm always still hungry. I got a medium here and couldn't even finish it.  Even though I've been through a good amount of poke places, the steps are very helpful. One huge plus here is that they mix everything together. Something different here is that they offer a spicy crab meat and also shrimp tempura. I really liked the spicy crab meat, it was a nice addition. They also have the option of pineapple and mango as toppings, which isn't offered everywhere.    I was really overwhelmed at the end trying to read all the sauce combos. I just didn't bother anymore and added whatever sauces tasted good in my mind.   The poke bowls are a little more on the pricier sides, but worth it. I couldn't even finish everything.",

    "text": "Yummy food, not so great experience. Last night (Friday, Nov 24) I made an order via Yelp and it's actually tied to Eat24. After I paid for my order, it instructed me that it would take 40 minutes to pickup from the time it was confirmed (takes only 5min to assemble). Maybe they were busy at the time. Showed up at 40 minutes (8:20pm) to an empty restaurant with two young girls (employees) eating on a table at the side. I was quickly greeted and one of them went behind the counter to wait on me. Upon informing her I was there to pickup an order from Yelp, she panicked, went to the side to grab a piece of paper and whispered to the other girl that they forgot about this one. She came back to me and told me sorry, they had customers, they forgot all about it, and that it wouldn't take long. I said that it was fine and knew it wouldn't take long (which is why 40min was a little much of a wait). Just not very professional or responsible to forget an order. Lucky I wasn't in that much of a rush, which is why most people order online (so that it's ready for pickup when they arrive). Someone else may have even left a single star, even though the food is amazing. The 3 stars is for the food, and would have been 5 if this was an altogether smooth experience. Also, the reason they did not get a tip. You never know what will happen, so I tend to tip after I have all my info. No sense tipping on my card when they forgot about my entire order lol that's just not smart. Place was clean, as always. The manager just needs to hire people with more focus. I'll still go back, just won't order online again.",

I tried the vegas style which was sesame oil, \"Gucci\" and ponzu. Lol they also have fresh marinated garlic as a topping which is BOMB that I don't see often in other poke places. Only downfall is there is no cream cheese which my boyfriend always requests with anything poke or sushi. Lol we literally killed both of our orders though. The small salad is a good portion. Next time I'm thinking on trying one of the bowls. The environment is clean and cute and have a cute little bench table for the kids too. Haha. def a must try for lunch at least. U can't beat the price.",

My favorite fish: albacore, red snapper, yellowtail, and salmon. It also comes with a free miso soup when you dine in. Wish they had one in SoCal bc I would keep coming. Definitely recommend if you're in/from Vegas!",

    "text": "This place is OK, I went there for the lunch special which include sushi burrito, miso soup, \"healthy water\" and gyoza +$1.50. When i started ordering the lady who's making my food said that miso soup and water only if you dine in, but if you check the huge sign they have outside it doesn't say dine in only. So she went and checked with the manager she said yes it's only for dine in she end up charging me for the burrito and the gyoza. What I wanna say is that they have False advertisement, they couldn't even honor it. On the other hand my boyfriend was ordering his food and he asked for shoyu soy sauce and the lady said that they don't have it. Which poke place don't have shoyu soy sauce!!!!!! I will never go back!!!!!!",
