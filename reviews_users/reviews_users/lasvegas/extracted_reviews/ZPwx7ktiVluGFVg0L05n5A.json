My husband and I have been here many time for breakfast and have never left dissapointed. Our servers are always very attentive and constantly refill our drinks and bread basket. I must admit I love Rincon de Buenos Aires because their food is always warm, never the plate which means nothing is reheated. We will definitely be coming back for future dates.",

    "text": "This last trip to Vegas, my group decided to keep things a bit more low-key and hit up some interesting spots that were off the beaten path, but were things we wouldn't normally get at home.  That was the mindset that led us here to Rincon de Buenos Aires. This place is located in a semi-shady part of town, in a strip mall which houses a giant neon-clad Chinese restaurant called \"The Jade\". When you first step into Rincon, it's not really what you'd expect out of a highly-rated restaurant. It's a hybrid deli/grocery store/restaurant. The tables are packed in very tight, and if you're someone who doesn't really enjoy a restaurant smelling \"like food\", you're going to be kind of taken aback.  Once you push past that, you'll treat yourself to a pretty good dining experience. Rincon de Buenos Aires is one part churrascaria, one part Korean BBQ. What I mean by that, is that their most commonly ordered dish is a giant pile of different steaks brought out to you on a mini-grill that is still hot. If your steak's not cooked to the level of doneness you want, just wait, it'll get there.  We ordered empanadas to start, which were tasty, but not great for me. I prefer my empanadas to have a good firmness to the crust, but the beef one that I got was soft and doughy. One of our group ordered the ham & cheese, and they had to make that one fresh so that the cheese melted, and he said it was much better. I also ordered a Cusquena, which turned out to be a fine crisp light beer, but nothing special.  Then came the big pile of steak. The three of us ordered the second option, (the one without the sweetbreads, which I an not a fan of) which includes filet mignon, flap meat, and short ribs. All of it was great quality meat. I think because it reminded me so much of a churrascaria, I was expecting to be seasoned more heavily, but it was pretty much lightly seasoned and seared.  We also ordered the salmon grillado to get something that wasn't cow. The salmon was cooked up nice and tasty. The menu said it was served with potatoes au gratin, but that's no au gratin. It was a few potato slices that had been oven baked with processed, dried parmesan cheese. I hate when places offer up \"Parmesan-style Cheese Dust\" as \"Parmesan cheese\" but I still enjoyed the salmon.  To finish the meal, we got the flan mixto, which I quite enjoyed. The caramel topping on the side is pretty great.  All tolled, the 3 of us had a very substantial meal with appetizers, drinks, and dessert for about $75 after tax. Solid eats.",

    "text": "If you are new to Argentinian food and culture, there is one thing you have to you have to understand:  They know how to make grilled foods taste exceptionally wonderful.  At Rincon De Buenos Aires, you never know what is going to be going on.  Once when I was there, they had a well known bandoleon player in playing Argentine music.  We were able to get in a little tango dancing by the front door.    Now about the food.  This last visit our group shared the Parillada Argentina.  It is served to your table sizzling on the grill.  We had Short Ribs, Skirt Steak, Sweet Bread, Sausage all grilled in the Argentine way.  We skipped the blood sausage as I wasn't sure I was up for that.  Everything was so perfectly cooked and we couldn't eat it all.  We also had a large salad to accompany the grilled food and that was a perfect side dish to balance the succulent meats.  Wine.  When in Rome..... you must order the Malbec to enjoy with your grilled items.  And let's have a moment to talk about Chimichurri.  What isn't that good on?  Have it on the fresh bread, on top of the meat, hmmmm I should try it on the salad also.  Chimichurri is made with garlic, parsley, onion and maybe some oregano.    I also have had the empanadas.  It is a pastry filled with various fillings, typically chicken, beef and sometimes ham and cheese.  It's somewhat like the calzone in concept if you haven't had an empanada before.  Try this as an appetizer.  You may also want to take some home from the deli.  If you love mate, you can buy it here.  There's a little store attached to the restaurant where you can purchase Argentine ingredients.  This is where I go to get the empanda wrappers to make them at home.  You can buy mate loose or in tea bags.  If you are unfamiliar with mate, it is like a green tea with an earthy  flavor and is a drink of friendship in Argentina. especially in the gaucho culture.  It is made from a holly type of plant.  It is high in caffeine so maybe it would be a good alternative to your morning coffee. I like it with a little honey and lemon.  To find Rincon De Buenos Aires, look for it in the shopping center that has Cathay House on Spring Mountain Road.",

My parents are from Argentina so this is the go to place if you want very close to authentic Argentinian food. Of course, nothing can beat a parrillada in Buenos Aires, but this place gets it pretty close! They also have Quilmes, the beer from Argentina, which is almost impossible to get here.  If you're looking to try a variety of meet,  I recommend the parillada Argentina. It comes with chorizo, skirt steak, blood sausage, and sweet bread. Don't forget to smother their delicious chimicurri all over the meat! They also have a deli where you can buy empanadas, meat, cheese, and... Wait for it .. SANDWICHES DE MIGA!! If you don't know what these are, I feel so sorry for your taste buds being deprived from deliciousness. They come in a pack of 6 sandwiches and look like little thin sandwiches without crust. Please do yourself a favor and order the ham and cheese ones and the mixed. They are so freaking good.  The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the service is super slow. They only had one waitress working when I went and they were completely slammed. I had to get up and ask her for the check. The parking situation here also sucks if you're going around lunch time. There is barley any parking so you'll have to drive around a few times and wait for someone to leave.  HIGHLY recommended for those who want a taste of Argentina!",

From the outside and even entering it doesn't look much like a restaurant, looks kinda like a deli to buy meat and stuff then you see table and seats throughout.  I think it's a mom & pop and absolutely love it!  This place is soooo bomb, well I'm a meat eater and they surely deliver on that!!  I forgot the name, however, we got the combo meat plate that came on a sizzling platter and for the most part, it stayed warm the entire time.  Oh, and the chimichurri, it's to die for! Put it on the bread, the meat, pretty much anything you want and it enhances the flavor.  What's even better is you could even buy a whole jar of it to take home for only about $5.  Let me tell you, the jar only lasted 1 week in my house so I figured we gotta budget $20 a month for chimichurri goodness =)",

We have enjoyed everything we've tried, and as a meat lover you can't go wrong with parallada argentina which is a mixed grill of assortment of meats. There are several options with varying meats. The grill prices range between $32 and $35 and can be shared by 3-4 people. Whatever you choose make sure to pair it with their awesome Chimichurri sauce and toasted bread. Also make sure to save room for dessert and get their flan with caramel and whipped cream. Overall the service is good and the prices are reasonable.",

    "text": "Items Selected: Toasted Bread with Chimichurri Ham and Cheese Empanada Corn Empanada Chicken Empanada Provoletta - Grilled Imported Provolone, Oregano, Olive Oil, Chili Oil Parrillada Argentina - Short Ribs, Skirt Steak, Sweetbreads, Sausage, Blood Sausage Flan Con Dulce de Leche Alfajor Cookie Milhojas - Puff Pastry, Condensed Milk, Cardamom Pasta Frola - Quince Pie  Located in the same Spring Mountain plaza as Cathay House and featuring signage indicating both their Argentinean roots and Italian influences, Rincon de Buenos Aires is the sort of spot that one could easily overlook in an area so heavy in Asian influence, but with strong endorsement from an out-of-town friend and another from Chowhound I finally decided to visit the sizeable space on Saturday with results more than exceeding modest expectations.  Undoubtedly a spot where 'regulars' are expected while newcomers are welcomed with open arms it was just after 11am when my friend and I entered the Argentinean barbeque doubling as bakery, deli, as well as gourmet market and quickly seated beneath an LCD television displaying futbol while the rest of Las Vegas buzzed about the American collegiate variety it was as though we'd instantly been transported many miles away, our smiling server just efficient enough in English to guide our hand to a baker's dozen of options served alongside toasty bread and herbal chimichurri that eschewed heat in favor of earthy notes and smoothness that complimented everything on which it was poured.  Beginning first with a trio of empanadas that featured flaky puff pastry around intensely spiced chicken, cheddar studded in pork, and shucked corn with sweetness tempered by onions and cream one would be hard pressed to choose a winner amongst the group and turning next to the Italian Provoletta a similar theme emerged, the texture intensely creamy while diverse aromatics and just a hint of spice tickled the palate with each balanced bite.  Unable to ignore the tabletop barbeque, presented still sizzling with pre-set options or choices a la carte, it was after perhaps thirty minutes that our enormous entree arrived and featuring more than enough for a family of four to share we each sampled widely, the blood sausage particularly noteworthy for myself with a spice profile and texture on par with artisan sausages I've paid double for elsewhere while the tender sweetbreads were also beyond reproach.  Transitioning to dessert I was fortunate to be dining with a friend who was more than willing to take the overindulgent approach and although I'm rather certain I consumed the majority of what was ordered there is no doubt that we were both invariably impressed by everything that arrived - the milky flan smooth yet rich while both the Milhojas and Alfajor presented a more restrained sweetness and textural juxtapositions of cream amidst crunch, a slice of quince pie rounding out the quartet with the fruit's intense sweetness finding its foil in a buttery golden crust.  Every bit as good as the rumors, and the very definition of 'hidden in plain sight,' Rincon de Buenos Aires is the sort of place anyone looking for something 'new' or 'different' should investigate, the prices trending a bit higher than much of Spring Mountain but quality of product, preparation, and service far outperforming most of them as well.  To the best of my knowledge the only Argentine barbeque in Las Vegas and one of the few places where blood sausage and sweetbreads can be bought by the pound even vegetarians will be safe here as the restaurant offers a number of unique pastas, pizzas, and produce driven options...not to mention prepackaged goods, ready-to-bake empanadas, and desserts that are well worth the effort even if you decide to take them home for later and skip the sizzling meats.",

    "text": "Bring on the meat sweat!  Think Argentina and one thing comes to mind, grilled beef and plenty of it.  The best part, this is beef for beef lovers.  Called butchers cuts in the States, these juicy cuts pack in the flavor.  A bath in chimichurri and... ahhh....  Perhaps I shouldn't be writing this review as Rincon De Buenos Aries is one of the best kept local's secrets in Vegas, the meat made me do it.  Skip everything and go straight to the mixed grills.  Each, loaded with different thick cuts of beef  and meant to be shared.  All served literally on a grill with burning charcoal.  Meats will continue to cook.  Don't let them sit.  Salt for seasoning and a bowl of chimichurri, the required condiment.  Uneven thickness therefore uneven doneness, a great thing.  Fire grilling adds charred bits of bitterness and a hint of acrid smokiness.     The Parrillada Argentina outstanding.  Fatty, grilled short rib on the bone, tender skirt steak, firm, smooth, flavorful sweetbreads,  a gently spiced white sausage and wonderful, minerally blood sausage.  For the squeamish, the Parrillada Martin Fierro (stupidly ordered with the previous grill - way too much food for four people) includes short ribs, skirt steak, flap meat, an chunks of fillet mignon.  The chimichurri itself, a showcase of vegetal parsley, herbaceous oregano, pungent minced garlic, spicy heat from crushed red pepper, peppery richness of olive oil and the acidic zing of vinegar.  Just the thing to refresh the palate for the next bite.  Plenty of Quilmes (Argentinean beer) to keep spirits high and wash everything down.  Great setting, part deli, part Argentinean grocery store, foreign tongues, and if you're lucky football (soccer) cheering.  Very friendly and welcoming service.  An all around excellent experience that begs to be repeated.",

I was extremely disappointed because all meats tasted bland. I am a big fan of argentina steak. Today I came in and ordered the Lomito Completo(filet mignon)sandwich. Hands down best steak sandwich I've ever had!!!!! I will definitely be coming back to give the parrilladas another try. Highly recommended!",

That was certainly not my experience. First of all the waiter never even cracked a smile, certainly wasn't friendly. After he put my food down he never returned to fill my water or perhaps ask why I wasn't eating the chicken.   I ordered the Pollo A La Provonzol with a salad as the side. It came with bread and herbed oil for dipping. The bread and herbs were amazing, absolutely delicious. The salad was alright, nothing great. The chicken breast was huge and filled the plate. It had obviously been beaten to make it flatter. The chicken was extremely dry and tasted of fish. It had to have been cooked with fish or at least on the same grill where fish had been cooked.   Ordinarily, I would have returned the chicken and had it prepared again, but by then I was slightly nauseated and no longer hungry. It's safe to say that I'll never eat there again.",

    "text": "Ate here for lunch with several coworkers. Arrived around 1145 worried that the lunch rush would be bad, but they sat us right away.  We all had empanadas to start, 2 meat platters minus the sweet breads, side salads, lots of bread and chimmichurri, and two desserts.  Empanadas were delicious. We had beef, chicken, and one spinach. Everyone agreed they were tasty and enjoyed that they were not deep fried. The meat platters came out next still sizzling. The meat is almost perfect and will continue to cook as you sit there so if u like your meat rare then grab it off there sooner than later. There was filet, flap, skirt, and short ribs. Seasoned perfect, but we added chimmichurri to the meat for even more flavor. The salad on the side help tame all the meats lol it was just lettuce tomato and red onion I believe. For dessert we had a dulce cookie type thing and a piece of quince pie.  Both were okay, dessert is not really my thing though.   The service was friendly, we had 2 women wait on us and they were very nice. We will definitely go back for lunch,  and personally I can't wait to take my husband there for a dinner date. The location is kind of small though so I have to imagine it gets packed for dinner. And I am aware of posts about parking issues with the other restaurant competition next door, but we came for lunch so it didn't seem to be an issue then, and no one yelled at us (from what I've read in other posts)",

I know you're thinking, an Argentinian restaurant in Chinatown that's legit?! Well yes, yes it is. It's also a deli and mini market. Upon entering you'll see a huge display deli case full of meats, cheeses, empanadas etc, to the right is a mini market that sells various dry goods, drinks etc.   Our server who greeted us upon entering told us to sit where we liked and she took our drink order right away. We pretty much knew what we wanted to order but we browsed the menu anyway. I'm curious about the Italian dishes they serve but I'm almost certain we will be ordering the grilled meats again. We were brought some bread and chimichurri upon menu browsing. I'm a little disappointed it wasn't warmed or toasted but the chimichurri made up for it. Flavorful oil with herbs and garlic. Just be careful to not to over indulge you will get full quick. Take my word for it ;)   We went ahead and ordered the Parrillada Martin Fierro which consists of kalbi,skirt steak, flap meat and filet mignon. We also added sausage since I didn't come with it. Also and two orders of Spanish rice which is a la carte. One order was not enough for the both of us. We came hungry though.    They brought over the meat feast and man oh man! I can't state how much I enjoyed this. Cooked a perfect medium so it was still juicy and pink inside. So delicious yet seasoned simply so the meat can stand on its own. My favorite was the filet but all the meats were really good. At one point in the meal my fiance mentioned he was meat wasted! In a good way of course. Drizzle the meat with chimichurri and eat it with the rice that soak up the juices from the meat. Honestly it was the best meal I've had in a long time and my mouth is watering just reminiscing. I will definitely be back to try the other meat platters as to decide which one is my favorite. Love this place!",

So my senses took over and like the natural carnivore that I am, I ravaged a juicy piece of filet mignon!  The popular section on the menu is the Parrilladas or Argentinean BBQ. Its great because you can SHARE! $34 a plate?...yea, you better share! You can get short rib, skirt steak, filet mignon, sausage, flap meat, and sweat bread!!!  Sweat bread is something that I have been hearing a lot of lately, so I was pleasantly surprised to see it on the menu and really wanted to try to eat it. So how does it taste? Like chicken of course!! However, it had a little hint of a fried egg - texture and look is like that of cooked chicken.  They present the meats on its own grill, still cooking - so you smell all the smoky goodness right in front of you. Served with a basket of bread and chimichurri sauce which is to die for.  The empanadas are good...all of them are good - beef, chicken, spinach, and potato! You have to drink it down with the local beer, Quilmes. It's a light lager, leaning towards the sweet side. It compliments nicely next to all the grilled meat. Washes it all down without distracting the flavor.   Don't want red meat, get Mariscos Buenos Aires - its squid, shrimp, clams, and scallops in a light garlic, tomato, and wine sauce. Seafood was good, but it was the first time that I had seafood in a tomato sauce. I guess, I was thinking it was going to be more garlic and creamy. But for the most part it was good. Would I get it again? Not unless I had an ulcer or turned vegetarian. The restaurant is definitely known for their red meat.  Not only is this place a restaurant, but it's also a deli and a super small market. Mainly offering cheese & meats that you would typically find for South American Latin cooking.",

The bread is like a ten inch mini-baguette, crispy, and the steak, perhaps a little more than a quarter inch thick is lean and cooked medium or rare as you like. Wine and beer are reasonable.You can order whatever looks good behind the deli glass such as empanadas or deserts. I know we have just scratched the surface of what is on offer by doing the steak sandwiches, but they are very flavorful and reasonably priced.   On the downside, seating was a little dense the last time we went on a Saturday night. On the upside, the waiters and waitresses are a bit old school; they are helpful without introducing themselves to you. I like that.",

We tried a bottle of the house wine. It was around ~$20. I've paid close to that for a glass in other places in Vegas. To my delight it was terrific. By the way, once you cross into Chinatown side of Vegas you have to check because many of the restaurants do not have a liquor license. I usually like to enjoy beer or wine with dinner.  There were 4 of us in the party and we shared 1 pasta dish and the grilled family style meats. It is served still on the mini grill. The meats were tender and cooked perfectly. The \"restaurant\" also is a meat deli and you can buy the meats to take home.  The wait staff was also excellent. We never felt rushed and our party enjoyed a long discussion with food served at a perfect pace.",

Of course, I went with high expectations my first visit and I have yet to be disappointed many trips later.  Like many others have stated, the chimmichurri sauce is to die for. I always have to save room for my food! I love their milanesa con pure (with mashed potatoes) and their sandwiches. Even my - very gringo - dad loves their food; he doesn't like to try anything new.  Although their flan is not the best I've had, the homemade alfajores (cookies with dulce de leche, or carmel, in the middle) taste like they're straight from my host mom's kitchen.  You won't be disappointed!",

Rincon continues to deliver the juiciest, most flavorful steaks.  Their empanadas (pastry stuffed with beef, chicken or spinach) are heavenly, I even pick up a few packages of the pastry discs needed to make some at home.  I'd make my own chimichurri, but why bother?  You can pick up a jar to take with you.  They make it there, and I doubt it could taste any better anywhere else.  And if dulce de leche (creme caramel) is your thing, try some of the fresh ALFAJORES, shortbread cookie sandwiches held together by dulce de leche, then rolled in shaved coconut... hmmm... may have to take a drive today...",

    "text": "I like to eat and I like chimichurri sauce.  My gf found this place the last time we were in Vegas back in November '09 and I'm glad she did.  The place is located in a strip mall with plenty of parking.  When you walk in, there's nothing special about it - there's a huge deli case in front, a small market, and the restaurant (albeit small) is off to the left.    Although I don't remember what I ordered, I couldn't get enough of the chimichurri sauce; I was using it on everything from the bread to my dish.  I thought there was crack in the sauce it was so good.  On the way out I perused the deli case and the market checking to see if they had chimichurri for sale, which they did.  The chimichurri sauce is bottled in these big ass bottles similar to the Ball jars you might see in certain stores or restaurants.  I ended up getting a jar and used it for everything and anything when I got home.  If you're ever visiting in Vegas, I would recommend this place instead of the traditional buffets everyone and their mom go to.  This is definitely the place I will be at the next time I'm in Vegas.",

Their chimmichurri sauce is like CRACK, but in a good addictive way that won't end up having you in jail. I think it could be spread on a car bumper and it would be delicious! (and so full of essential minerals to boot!)  Their tableside BBQ is unique and very very tasty. I've gotten the mixed grill the 3 times i've been, and it's ALL good. Yes, even organ meat is good on it. (and i'm not a fan for except sweetbreads)  A Vegas gem!",

Great place to go for different reasons - a sandwich for lunch, a date night for steak/pasta or a good place to go with family and have a nice conversation over a great meal. You never feel rushed and it's a bonus that they carry Argentinian products like mate and all the accessories.",

Forget the dessert and have it someplace, both the Tiramisu (dry cake with some pseudo coffee cream not good and the Mil Hojas was awful, gigantic and all caramel so very cloy ugh....

    "text": "We yelped and we yelped. So we decided on this new adventure. How can you have an Argentinian restaurant amidst Chinatown...? I did get a kick out of it.  To cut a long story short, the service sucked and the foods was American. Obviously we only had a small selection to base on... forgot to try the sweet bread.  I had the BBQ grill with 3 kinds of steaks... Fillet Mignon, skirt, and flat. It's all tasted good, with American flavor. Can't tell what's so special about the taste. The meats were slightly overdone... in most cuts here. And the portable hot grill plate (where the meat was served on the table) kept them cooking even further. For the price, there was no side dishes... but you certainly can order a la carte... French fries $3.95 and mixed salad $4.95.  My friend order Fillet Mignon. He loved it. It was missing some cooked vegetables on the plate but he didn't complain. It came with a medium size mixed dinner salad (I thought medium size fries was included... we did not order it but it was brought to the table and we got charge for it) for $17.95. It was harder to swallow under the circumstance.  It came with free breads and strong garlic olive oil for dipping. I used it on the salad too. Not bad. The Argentinian tea (in a tea bag) was interesting and not bad, but not much different than regular herbal tea on my not-so-subtle tongue.  A boxing game (Khan and Maidona) was being streamed live from Mandalay bay. It was not very crowded. Our server was very friendly but communication was not the best. And worse, she was watching the game more than attending to our needs. The bus boy did a better job to get us hot water to refill tea, and bread basket.  My friend loved the food experience overall. It's OK for me.  So diners, enjoy some American dishes (the other was mainly Americanized Italian). Service can be spotty. Make sure you double check your order for extra foods and unexpected charges.",

Could it be?  You know, it really was.  It was a Neon Beer Sign for one of my new favorite beers, Quilmes.    Very hard to find because it's actually a beer from Argentina.  I had actually tried one bottle from one of those \"Beers of the World\" packs just a couple months earlier and had been looking for it all over San Francisco but couldn't find it but all of a sudden, out of the blue, I just saw that little neon sign and all of a sudden \"DAM, Ain't Life Good???\"     We went in and bought a couple six packs to go, then noticed they had some deli foods so even though we were full from Dim Sum, we ended up trying some of their empenadas and some authentic desserts from Argentina.    This place actually seemed like an Italian themed Argentinian restaurant as they sold Prosciutto and Italian Sandwiches too.      So after trying thier snacks and dessert, they were indeed very tasty but it is really all about the Quilmes baby!!!",

Portion sizes were generous, we both had trouble finishing our sandwiches. They are perfect for a big eater.   We also started the meal with an empanada. This was freaking awesome. Highly recommend trying one ($1.95) while you're there. Beef, chicken, ham and cheese.. you can't go wrong.

We ordered the Ensalada Bueno Aires and their Parrillada (grilled meat platter) with a extra order of chicken breast.  I also had to try their chicken empanada.  The filling was quite good, but I wasn't too crazy about the crust.  The salad had heart of palms, roast red peppers, red onions, boiled eggs, tomatoes and romaine lettuce in it.  It was huge and very refreshing.  For $7.99 it was a good deal.  The meat platter was also a good deal.  It came with two pieces of short ribs, two skirt steaks, a piece of fillet mignon, a piece of flap meat and our additional piece of chicken breast.  The short ribs were a little tough, but the rest of the meats weren't bad.  For less than $40, we had it was quite a feast with all those meats. Their chimcurri dip that came with our bread was also good.   Although this is not my usual fare, I quite enjoyed this change in taste.",

Start with the meat or chicken Empanadas. The Parrillada Fierro was a great platter of meats perfectly seasoned. The Milanesa beef sandwich was also good. This is definitely a goto spot for me.",

    "text": "Rincon de Buenos Aires is a very nondescript shop that can easily get lost in the noise of china town.  The first thing you see when looking a the shop is a bunch of different signs that say deli, bakery and finally the name of the business.  But, on to the show!  As usual, when I go to a restaurant for the first time, I try to try as many items on the menu as possible without physically getting ill.  So this journey included the chicken empenada, beef milanesa sandwich and finally the skirt steak, and oh the chimichurri sauce...  So the bread with chimichurri sauce they serve is no joke.  At first you take a little nibble of bread with a light dip in the sauce.  If you aren't careful, you be soon asking for bread by the ton and taking chimichurri shooters off a hooker.  The chimichurri sauce is THAT DAMN GOOD.  But, don't let the chimichurri seduce you into getting full.  You have to try other things.  The chicken empenada was moist, with great spices and flavor all mixed into the shredded chicken.  The milanesa was the only underwhelming item I tried, but a healthy dose of chimichurri sent the sandwich overboard.  The star of this adventure was definitely the skirt steak.  Easily, one of the top four steaks I have had to date.  I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly, with a charred-spice crust on the outside, perfectly pink inside, and ohh soo tender and juicy.  The skirt could easily stand on its own with out ANY extras, but the addition of a bit of the chimichurri, and boom, you may need to clean up your pants.  Instant orgasm.  Grab a cab and take an adventure to China Town in Vegas for this amazing gem of a restaurant.",

    "text": "4 1/2 stars!  What a little gem! You will not be dissapointed with luch here!  Me, Dad, and Hubs stopped in for lunch after a recomendation from a coworker.  It is a silly little place.  It's really more of a shop/deli counter but there are about 10-12 tables to dine at too.  I don't know a whoel lot about Argentinian food, but I do know they do empanadas and beef!  We started with two empanadas, 1 beef, and 1 spinach.  Flaky, flavorful and tasty.  Beef was the winner.  They serve crusty bread with a nice dish of chimmichurri.  Excellent. The bread is crunchy so you can really soak up at that oily garlicky herby goodness.  We all chose a hot sandwich served with french fries.  I had a delectable sandwich (can't remember the name) but denoted with a star as a favorite.  It was steak, ham, provolone, fried egg, lettuce and tomatoes on a baguette.  It was awesome.  Dad had the choripan.  It was an argentinian sausage sliced on a baguette with chimmichurri.  Very good, and a bargain at only $6.50 for a 9' sandwich with a pile of fries.  My husband had the sweetbread sandwich.  He was in heaven.  Swears they were the best sweetbreads he has ever had.  He raved....5 stars!!!  He also tried the local brew - Quilmes - he wasn;t a fan but understood how they must go down easy on a hot day.  We took home some sandwich halves and extra fries.  Bill was $44 for 2 sodas, 2 beers, 2 empanadas, and 3 sandwiches with leftovers for later.  Delicious!! Server was super cute, nice, helpful, and friendly too! We will definitely go back for a killer lunch.",

After looking for a while we dicided to try Rincon de Buenos Aires. Best decision ever!   The helpful staff let us order by phone after being late for our last Vegas show, so when we arrived the food was almost ready! We could enjoy our dinner and be on time for the show. Thank you again!  During our dinner we enjoy of the empanadas and the morcilla, after that we went for the parrilla Fierra, only meat!  The meat was tender and the flavor amazing. We love it so much that we went to dinner in Rincon a second time a week later when we came to Las Vegas again.  Also love the wine and the ambience in the restaurant, noting fancy but more like being home.",

I had no clue I could eat all the food I ate and it's mainly because everything was delicious. Our waiter was amazing, he suggested plenty of great dishes. We were planning to get one dessert, but because of his guidance we got three and we're pleasantly happy. And guess what, I ate all three!!

The selection of beef cuts (filet, flank steak, and short ribs) on our Parilla plate was absolutely delicious, and more than enough for two.  I wish I knew how Argentinian and Brazilian restaurants manage to get so much flavor into their meats.  Man, that's good!    My wife started with a Caesar Salad (which was also more than enough for two, by the way).  I started with a charcuterie plate of jamon, salami, cheese and olives.  Both of those starters were first rate.  A side of fries was very good.  Even the soft bread served with chimichurri was a great treat.  We also tried the empanadas - the ham & cheese was excellent, the beef not so much.  Wine by the glass was very good and quite inexpensive (like $7 a glass).    The ambiance was about what you would expect from a strip mall location that doubles as a deli counter.  Not as comfortable as, say, Fogo de Chao but it makes up for it by being a great deal (and, in our case, by being only about a mile from our house).  The service was quick and friendly, although our waiter was a little bit hard to understand.  So, when we are feeling carnivorous and we want it cheap and convenient, Rincon is the place.",

    "text": "I chose Rincon because of the excellent reviews on Yelp, and because I'm really a latina at heart, if not DNA.  Having been to Buenos Aires twice, it would be like going home.  I had made a reservation; it turned out not to be necessary when we arrived at 8:45, but might be earlier.  The tables are in front of and to one side of a very wide deli counter, which serves as a take-away empanada place, dessert haven, deli, cheese shop and even butcher, and I imagine it could get crowded earlier.  We were greeted warmly by, I guess, the manager, who is from Chile, another favorite place, and seated at a comfortable table.  Limited wines and beer are offered.  Since we don't eat some of the items offered on the parillada, I ordered the Lomito Completo and my husband had the Grilled Lemon Chicken sandwich, which has cheese and red bell pepper.  We both had salads instead of fries, his with onions, mine without.  The salads were simply lettuce and a good supply of sliced tomatoes, not remarkable, but large and very fresh.  To start, Herb ordered a chicken and vegetable soup, served piping hot in a deep bowl, and full of large chunks of chicken, a variety of fresh vegetables, including butternut squash,delicious, and obviously not from a can.  The sandwiches were as good as can be for Las Vegas, where the concept of dense bread apparently is unattainable.  My lomito was cooked medium rare, just as I ordered, and the combination of the steak, ham, and fried egg was heavenly.  Herb loved his, too, and we were both too full to finish our sandwiches.  Yay, no cooking tomorrow!    Service was friendly and efficient, our only complaint being that the sandwiches came before the soup was even finished.  This is a minor nit for an otherwise wonderful meal, a great place to practice my Spanish, and another Vegas \"find\" to add to our list of favorites.",

There is a large deli display case filled with goodies that greets you when you walk in. The host and the waiter were both friendly and helpful answering all of questions.  The food was delicious! They quickly brought us out warm bread, oil, balsamic and chimichurri. We started off with a \"tarta pascualina\" which is a little spinach pie and a \"picada a los Buenos Aires\" a cheese/ meat platter with potato salad. For our main dish, we ordered two of the parilladas, (which are an assortment of meats brought out on a coal grill), a side of mashed potatoes and the Italian salad. I didn't try the 3 story flan, but it got great reviews by friends. We were a party of 5 and there was plenty of food to go around. There was a man serenading us with his accordion was a great touch.   Overall this was real treat for all of us. We enjoyed the experience and will be recommending it to everyone!",

    "text": "Good to branch out and try a cuisine that is not often represented in American fare, the Argentinian.  It is like a cross between Latino/Caribbean and Italian, if I had to characterize it.  Try the Chicken Milanese.  It comes pretty simply prepared, just pounded out, breaded chicken, but well-seasoned.  Empanadas are a no-brainer (and a bit like a Jamaican beef patty, if I had to analogize it).  There is little to no ambience here, unless you count the World Cup or other soccer game on a TV.  Also, as another Yelper pointed out, there is a bit of xenophobia here, if you are not Latino.  But go with a thick skin, and a brave spirit, or with an Argentine friend (as I did).  I like the fact that they sell Argentine staples here, too, like Mate (a type of tea that is high caffeine).  I heard, though, that the authenticity has fallen now that the ownership has changed (from Argentine to Colombian owners).",

    "text": "Hmm, mixed emotions about my visit. I will say the highlight was the chimichurri. I could put that on EVERYTHING! And the beer, they get points for that too. Not to mention the service was excellent. Perhaps I'm just not used to this type of food, whatever the case, it wasn't my cup of tea.   The second you walk in you'll notice it's a no frills joint with this huge deli case (which I didn't expect to see) front and center taking up most of the restaurant. And even more strange the raw meat & ready made items in the same case. At this point I was just hoping I didn't leave with a terrible stomach ache. Somehow I managed to leave unscathed.   The empanadas were tasty but lacked that flaky texture you'd expect from freshly made empanadas. We ordered the Parillada Argentina. Although sweetbreads aren't my thing, I was told they were very tasty. I tried it by mistake thinking it was chicken. One and done. That was enough for me. Doubt I'll ever be a fan of sweetbreads. The filet mignon was a tad overcooked. I had asked for medium, but it was definitely well-done. The outside was pretty rough and took some effort to cut with my steak knife. It did have a great flavor though so that could've been easily fixed.   All in all, glad I ventured out to try something new. Love the mom & pop/family owned restaurant vibe here which is rare in this city. And the fact that they had an actual changing table in the restroom, not that bulky plastic one you see everywhere else, made it feel like home or visiting relatives. Probably won't be back but glad to check another bookmark off my list.",

    "text": "3.5 Stars for this cute  and unique Argentine restaurant in Las Vegas' International District.  As we entered we were greeted by a pleasant hostess. The deli style restaurant was busy on a Friday evening at 4pm. I ordered  a cup of coffee and the Lomito Completo (Filet Mignon with Provolone Cheese, ham, fried eggs, tomato on a Baguette bread).  Their Columbia drip coffee was very good..I was impressed. Their Chimichurri sauce was excellent.  Unfortunately, the steak sandwich we ordered was little dry and lacking flavor...BUT we saved it by dumping the remains of the Chimichurri sauce (that we got at the beginning of the meal with the bread) on the sandwich. For dessert we ordered the Milhojas, but it tasted pretty awful..we did not like the taste or texture and stopped eating after two bites.  On this particular night the restaurant was understaffed and our poor waitress had to work way too hard.   Because of their good Yelp reviews we'll probably return sometime in the future to try some different menu items (also for their tasty coffee). We were also impressed by their nice staff.  Luckily they sell their Chimichurri sauce. We bought a big Mason jar for $5.49 on our way out. :)",

We got sides of Spanish rice, ensalada russa, and ensalada mixto. With the sides we fed 4 adults. They also give you bread and chimichurri for $1.75. We got dessert of alfajores and Mil ojas to go. Both delicious and the alfajores were exactly like you get in Argentina. Prices are OK. The sides are actually the only thing I thought were over priced and the only reason I did not give 5 stars.",

    "text": "I followed Yelp reviews here when we looked for a Steakhouse - not many in Vegas are layman priced, but this one was.  Sure, you don't get your 40th floor view of the strip, white tablecloth experience, but the place has a charm of its own.  When you first walk in, you might think you're at the wrong place because it looks like a specialty deli, and actually is - you can purchase empanadas and an assortment of meats and cheeses.  But they added seating to the floor space to make it a restaurant.  I visited Argentina 6 months ago and the food here was very much comparably authentic.  We ordered the chicken, steak and yummy corn empanadas - they aren't made fresh, but still very good.  We were a party of 5 and ordered the Parilla plate and Ribeye, the latter of which was so succulent and bursting with flavors.  It paired VERY well with a bottle of Luigi Bosca Malbec, which I highly recommend - soft and silky smooth tannins, very well structured.  The parilla meats were enough to fill all of us (sweet bread, skirt steak, filet, sausage).  We topped things off with the dulce de leche cookie, flan and crepe (with dulce de leche).  They were all delicious - maybe too much caramel in the crepe, but no big deal.  Our waitress was very nice and they were prompt with food.  And again, the prices were very reasonable - about $150 for 5 of us, including a bottle of wine and three desserts and enough meat to fill all of us to the brim.    I definitely will come back here again.  It's great food, quaint ambience and friendly staff makes this an easy five stars.",

The Empanadas are amazing and their Entrana is by far better than a good filet minion, and I am not exaggerating.    Also their homemade Chimichurri is amazing!  I have been to Texas De Brazil and Fogo de Chao and while they have good Chimichurri, Rincon's is hands down the best!

They are known for their barbecued meat that literally come serves on a small BBQ grill, a must-try if you want to have the real experience... I ordered the veal steak, while my roommate had one of their sandwich, and I have to say I was a bit disappointed; the meat was a bit chewy for me, but my roommate loved his sandwich. I always get their Empanadas to go (spinach and cheese, beef, chicken, but try their deep fried ham and cheese ones!) and don't care about anything else but you have to try their menu items to really appreciate all they have to offer. Their sandwiched are really good and service is very friendly. I will definitely try them again and maybe have a better luck next time, but I still give them a decent rating because not too many places feel as authentic as this little one. Oh and did I mention, they have a full case of freshly prepared pastries, pies, deserts and meats as well as a grocery area as well? Very family oriented place good for small groups of people as you will quite often see...",

Rincon service was very good and the food was very good. We ordered the marten fiero, which has skirt steak, filet mignon, flank and short rib. Very flavorful and tender. I thought it was way better than most steak restaurants on the strip and the price for 3 people and a large salad was $72 that included tax and tip. What steak restaurant can you go to on the strip to feed 3 people for that price??   If your a meat lover this place won't disappoint. The steaks are awesome.",

We found this little gem with the help of yelp and google maps. We were certainly surprised!!!   To start they have Quilmes Argentinean beer, and it's delicious. They also give you a loaf and bread and some aaamazing chimichurri. I had to have an empanada they're a big deal to me, and I looooved their spinach one. I could've just had a couple of those and been happy, but we were there to eat.   I order the salmon with potatoes and my date ordered the ribeye with mashed potatoes. Mine was delicious and simple. He said his steak was great as well.... but his potatoes he attacked those they were so good. I tried them before he finished them and yup get the mash!!!   For dessert I had the flan mixto which is flan with dulce de leche and whipped cream. I've had a lot of flan in my day, and this one is one to remember.   It's a casual atmosphere with great service, and don't worry about being able to speak Spanish the menu is also written in English and the staff speak English as well. The prices are extremely reasonable for a steak and seafood dinner.",

Next you have to try the empanadas! A must have! I always have the ham and cheese empanada and or the beef empanada!  For your main dish you have to try the \"Parrilladas\" Argentinean BBQ.

When the meat is on the fire, careful the oils will splatter everywhere and the fire isn't controllable since it's coals. The meat was good, seasoned right! It was A LOT of meat!   Environment  Seemed like they had a little deli section to the right. Pretty quite place, good for sit down and chatting.   Niceness of people The servers were nice but tried to overdose us with meat! They made sure we were enjoying our meals. Made suggestions on what's popular.   Dollar It's reasonable for the amount of meat you are getting. I forgot what the bill was like.   Yes? I would return here with friends that like meat yes. It's a great experience.

    "text": "Perfect if you like your meat served with a side of 'intolerance.'  Not like hardcore... but the kind probably exhibited by your oldest uncle (this is a cross-cultural thing so I'm not singling anyone out)... you know the kind.   The first time I went, an old argentine man was yelling at me en espanol because I parked in front of the store... he probably assumed that since I was Asian, I was going to one of the adjacent Asian businesses... but I wasn't.  This dude followed me in screaming about how 'this chino' was parked out front.  The folks inside assumed I didn't understand what he was saying since I guess Asians can't understand derogatory screaming and pointing... the folks inside seemed embarrassed enough but didn't apologize or try to remedy the situation. I blew the old guy off understanding that he was from another time and place.   Fast forward some months, and I'm back in the store... this time I'm ignored and can't be served at the butcher counter... every Spanish speaker gets served but not the Asian dude waiting his turn.    Fast forward again, and I'm back at the butcher counter... this time I'm served with a side of rude and haste... but there was a nice woman behind the counter who stepped in realizing what was happening.  She was very nice, but the same rude guy rang up my order at the register.  After getting my CC statement a few days later I realized I was overcharged by nearly double.   So you might be wondering why I keep coming back?  It's because my wife is Argentine and occasionally wants stuff from the homeland.  she'll sends me for empanadas or some cuts of beef since my office is closer to this place than hers.  I personally am a sucker for mollejas and blood sausage, so I can put up with some BS.  If you order anything pre-made or from the restaurant- the food is very over cooked, salty and prepared last week.  It's not my thing, but my wife's family enjoys the soggy mayonnaise sandwiches with no crust.  Most if not all the cuts in the Parilla are pre-cooked and re-heated before bring served on the bed of coals...  My advice, go for the raw butcher cuts and grill them up at home... they're usually ok if you're looking for the more exotic cuts not found at Albertsons or Whole Foods.    2 Stars since i'd be a hypocrite giving it one star while having been a repeat customer.",

So he YELP'D Argentine/Italian food Las Vegas and we found this place.  Okay, in a strip mall somewhere deep in Chinatown (you can get as many food massages along the road as you want).  Cute little Deli/restaurant.  We had a 1/2 carafe of wine with one of their grill meals for 2.  YUM YUM YUM.  So the negative?  No one really needs that much dead cow...but it was quite yummy with a side gargantuan salad.  Bread with some chimichuri sauce.  OOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  and they have EMPANADAS!  We had a few of those also.  Again, off the strip and this is why people should visit Las Vegas!",

    "text": "My first Argentine experience and it was delicious!!    This place is a restaurant, deli and small supermarket.  I had the Lomito Completo sandwich with filet mignon, cheese, ham, fried egg, lettuce, tomato and some mayo for good measure.  Not something I typically would order, but I was told it was awesome, so I went for it!  And it most certainly was!  Another friend had the Especial Milanesa sandwich (thin sliced chicken, breaded with a sauce) which was also very delicious, but I like mine better!  Boss had the seafood soup which was the soup of the day and he said it was great too.  We started out with a couple empanadas - beef, corn, potato and all three were yummy!!    One star knocked off for their pizza - our friend who ordered it said it tasted frozen, not good at all.  And in hindsight, we didn't see anyone tossing or maneuvering dough!  Stay away from the pizza unless you're a frozen pizza kind of person!   There's quite a few Italian dishes on the menu, some Cuban too.  The menu is pretty large.  The service is top notch, very friendly, helpful and refills came around very timely too.   The bread with olive oil and herbs/spices that they serve before the meal is really good -- I love the herbs n oil, delish!!  I noticed they sell it bottled in their deli section too.  I'm happy to have found this gem, who know??  But I'll be back, there's so many other things I'd love to try!",

Now, I'm hooked on empanadas (I think I had a version of these somewhere, but they weren't good) and chimichurri sauce. I had their delicious barbecued short rib meal, Tira de Asado. It was grilled to perfection and just the way I like it. Their potato salad was also good and tasted very fresh. It was nice that they served bread with chimichurri sauce, which I couldn't stop eating. I love delis and the fact that they have a one in the restaurant--a bit different, but it made it feel authentic. The service was fairly good and the place was clean with its tables with white tablecloths. I made sure to leave with a couple of empanadas from the deli and a nice good size of their delicious chimichurri sauce. I'll be back!",

I got a New York strip medium well with either canned or frozen vegetable mix (carrots, corn, green beans, etc). My party of four also ordered a filet mignon and it was overcooked (med well) - the person didn't eat the whole filet because it was dry. We also ordered chicken Marsala - good taste, but it was dry as well. And don't order the shrimps - it was literally a handful of small frozen shrimps in a sauce.",

Paradilla was cooked perfectly, tender and flavorful. The grill keeps the meat warm and crisp. They have real coals under the tableside grill.   They also have a deli with great sandwiches, meat and other south american products.  Only downers about this place are the decor, feels a little shabby inside (probably wouldnt bring a date here), and the hours. Place closes at 8 or 9 during the week. Just way too early! I'm told by my Argentine people that the decor is actually super authentic and is a plus for them. I think the benefit is that this place is under the radar, thank god it isn't one of those hot vegas spots where you need to book a week ahead or need to queue for a long time.",

My parents got asado and even though it was a little pink despite asking for it well done it was decent. The mollejas were good, the chimichurri was great, the bread seemed to be heated up in a microwave and was soft. The ricotta ravioles I got were hard and pretty bad, I couldn't even finish the plate. The masa of the empanadas were kinda doughy and unpleasant. The day I went there were three women working. One waitress was sweet, the other was... Just having a bad day I guess.  I didn't get a refill on my drink til I was done eating, and I can understand that when you're busy you forget but come on, they checked on us twice throughout the whole meal. If you want something be sure to shout for it.  Overall if you just want argentine cuisine for a decent price and aren't expecting a 4 star meal this is the place for you. I used to really love this place so I'm hoping they just had a bad day and will get back on track but as of right now I'm not planning to stop by next time I'm in town.",

I can eat a steak with the best of them, and that is exactly what I did at Rincon De Buenos Aires.   It is not fancy, and the service is casual, i.e. we had to get up to get drink refills. But, the spot feels authentic (even though I am in no way an Argentine expert). They were showing a soccer game on their televisions, and it wasn't being broadcast in English. That is when I decided the place was legit.    As others have noted, the chimichurri sauce deserves to be poured generously on everything. It is delicious and fresh. We ordered the meat fest for 2 (I think that is an accurate translation), and it came on a miniature charcoal grill with two filets, two skirt steaks and 2 short ribs for $30. The meat wasn't incredible, but the value is! We also ordered the mixed green salad which is a large bowl of leafy lettuce, thinly sliced red onions and tomatoes served simply with oil and vinegar. It is also a value at $4.95!  We finished the meal with some coffee and a latte, and we were both pleasantly surprised by some wonderfully strong brews. We will definitely be back for beef, a side of greens and a buzz.",

I arrived at a deli and it feels absolutely weird and non romantic at all.   We ordered the food that my friend told me to ordered. Which is paierlla something martin fierro. A bunch of combination of meat for $34.99. I was expecting some magical steak with some argintenian sauce that I dont know about since I am a food connoiseur and I would like to be blown away.  I wasnt expecting just bunch of low quality meat put on a charcoal based pan seared only with seasalt. I can do that myself thanks very much.  So suffice to say I am very dissapointed having to spend $60 for lunch and its not something that I honestly happy about. Service was good and attentive but its a one and done for me.",

If you go for dinner, try their grilled meats for two ($29.99). They have a lot of choices to offer..They also have a wine list, just ask for it.  Overall good food, but the place needs a major face-lift. The inside has very dim lighting and the setup is kind of odd (mini mart + deli + restaurant). If you don't care about that and just want some good food this is the place to go to.",

I haven't had a better experience anywhere in Vegas.  The empanadas I never miss. These aren't the Mexican style jelly filled empanadas, they are the delicious meat and cheese filled kind. They are so good they take you right to the streets of Argentina. I ordered these my second time there, and every time I go back I always start with them.   I've also ordered other items, that frankly, failed pretty hard. Last time I went I had a breaded and fried chicken, pollo empanizado, it was spendy for what you got. Tasted like it had been bought from the pre-cooked frozen food section of wal-mart, and it didn't look good either. Poor meat quality, and one of those individually sliced cheese squares melted on top. Two people, bill came out to ~$45 for two of those, a plate of three empanadas, and two sodas.   Moral of the story, go there for the beef. Get steak, get there asado style meals, get the things you would want to get if you flew into Buenos Aires, I haven't been dissappointed yet when I order the right items.   Between my visits with myself and my wife, we each have ordered plates that we didn't like...at all...but when we order the right items, this place can't be beat.  Lastly, they have a little store in the back, you can go in and get mate, alfajores, and a whole host of other Argentine products. Not bad at all.",

    "text": "A co-worker of mine recommended this place to me. She's FROM Argentina, so when she told me that this place is IT, I whole-heartedly trusted her.   The place is located on Spring Mountain in a little plaza called Cathay Hills. Yes, it's where Cathay House is located. If you love dim-sum, then I'm sure you've eaten there.  But I'm not reviewing dim-sum right now so moooooving oooooon....  This place is located on the left side of the plaza and it's half restaurant, quarter deli, and a quarter supermarket. I haven't really looked around the other half of the place because I immediately sit down and am completely eager to get served the DELICIOUS chimichurri that they place on your table, with white toasty bread. I have NEVER had chimichurri in my life and I feel like my life really hadn't been complete before tasting the vinegary, olive oily, garlic-y sauce of the Gods. I literally slathered it on every single thing I had on my plate.   It's been a few months since I've been there, so forgive me for not remembering what the official names of the dishes we've ordered are.   Their empanadas always taste like they JUST rolled them out and filled them like 4 minutes before they served them to you. Fresh. Flavorful. Delicious. You have to order them.   I know we've had their steak sandwich. The meat is really tender and I have no idea what they marinate their meat in, but it's amazing. SLATHER on the chimichurri and you're DONE.   I've ordered a breaded steak with a FRIED EGG on top. The steak was tender and flavorful and if I remember correctly, in between the steak and the breading was some sort of garlic and parsley mixture that just sent this whole dish on another level of decadence and to top it of with a fried egg? I. CAN'T. EVEN. (my mouth is filling up with saliva as I type this.)   I know we've had some french fries (came with the sandwich), which are pretty standard but AGAIN, dip them in that chimichurri and the whole thing just livens up. It's no longer a simple potato stick. It's a hotter, sexier and more flavorful potato stick that the other potato sticks whistle and gawk at while it walks on the side of the road, wind blowing in its luscious potato stick hair. (don't know where that came from.)  Their flan is pretty tasty and they serve sodas like Inca Cola to make your meal extra authentic, lol :D soooooo deliciously creamy and bubbly.  The service is always SUPER friendly and home-y and I swear, every time I go there, the waitresses are always laughing with and talking to at least two other patrons that they are either REALLY close friends with or their hospitality is just THAT amazing. I HIGHLY recommend this place. It's a hole-in-the-wall that deserves lots of LOOOOVE! go there for lunch. or dinner. just go. NOW!",

    "text": "Argentina..the land of the beef , good soccer and the home of the super hot Italian looking girls that have that latino flavor. Yes..you can say Im a big fan of their country, food and of course woman,  This spot is legit. Owned, managed and operated by argentinians. Nice people, very personable and super sweet. From the guy behind the counter , to the lady in the cashier this place rocks. And their service is great as well. You are welcomed fast, serviced faster and catered the same way.  Their steak sandwich is to die for, and if you never tried morcila(blood sausage) this is the place to do it. If argentinians have mastered something , is soccer and BBQ. This guys can cook the steak, sausage , etc so perfect that its an orgasmic experience. Trust me ..try it. Go all out on the cow!  If you don't feel like a whole big meal, you can order sandwiches and also empanadas . Both of them OWN. They packed them with meat so you get a lot of flavor from every bite. Try a \"triple de miga\" or an \"empanada de carne\"  You like garlic? You like oil? Like flavor? Add TONS of chimichurri to whatever you are eating. Don't get the fancy packed one..ask them about their home made chimichurri .I tell people that God came down on the 8th day and created chimichurri . That's how good it is .There not a single person that have tried it that didn't like it. Mix it with everything, most likely you will get addicted  On the right side of the place there are a couple counters and refrigerators where you can buy sodas, and products from southamerican countries. Don't expect a huge selection, but more of the \"top 3\" from each country. Pretty convenient if you want to take some stuff home.  I like this place and its one of its kind. Good people, central location,good food, good service and good prices .If you want to experience the whole thing..try to go when argentina is playing an important soccer game, or a night where they are playing tango. You will enjoy it .",

This is definitely a great sandwich and can be shared by two people and be fully satisfied. It comes with fries and this green dressing that taste awesome with the sandwich. This I give 5*'s.   Today, we also ordered their potato salad. I thought this would be a great addition to the sandwich. First bite in to it there really isn't any taste until after swallowing. The fishy after taste creeps in immediately. I thought it was probably because I am recovering from a flu but after a few more bites, I couldn't handle it anymore. It almost tasted like it was made with old gross fish. Even my bf made a comment about it. I will definitely not get it again. This I give no stars.   Hence the total of 4*'s.",

    "text": "We just had an early dinner tonight and I would recommend this place to friends and family.  My boyfriend, who is somewhat picky at what restaurant to eat at, was happily  surprised and enjoyed our experience.    The restaurant is very clean, and inviting.  The staff was very friendly.  It wasn't that busy at 430pm but at about 6 pm'ish people started to come in.  We started off with 3 empanadas (beef, chicken and spinach).  We both agreed that the beef and chicken was very good.  Spinach was good, to me. My boyfriend doesn't like spinach too much, anyway.  We also ordered the Ensalada del Chef.  It's very large - I think it can feed 4 people with nice portions on each plate.  It had everything on it:  deli meats, peperocinos,  slices of hard boiled eggs, julienne slices of carrots, slices of olives, thin slices of red onions....etc etc.   And, was very good.  The dressing they give is is just a light balsamic and olive oil that you mix yourself.  Not sure if they have other flavored dressings but then, we didn't ask.  We were okay to just use what was given to us.    For entree, I had the Mariscos Buenes Aires and I enjoyed it.  The red wine sauce was savory and sweet.  There was squid in the recipe and gladly it was very tender and not chewy.  My boyfriend ordered the Salmon Grillado.  He enjoyed it.  I tasted a bite of the salmon and also the parmesan potatoe side that came with it.  It was yum.  The salmon was a good long piece of fillet.  Nothing special about the salmon, though. No special seasonings or anything.  I can make it better at home but it is a nice serving of a fish.  Add the chimichurri sauce and it enhanced the flavor!!  :)  For dessert I ordered the Flan, waitress recommended, and, my boyfriend ordered the Panquesques dulce de leche (which we took to go).  I am glad we did because the Flan was a big serving!  I had flan before but this recipe was outstanding!  It was served with a side of whip cream and 3 dollops of carmel.  OMG!   YUM YUM YUM!!  I wanted to take a pic of it but both of our phones were in the car.  I liked that presentation of it.  :)  Can't tell you yet on the Panquesques - we are relaxing from the dinner still.  :)  AND, lastly but not forgotten - the chimichurri sauce was awesome!   You could put this sauce on anything and it would be great.  My boyfriend put some of it on his salmon and it was yummy!   Soooo gooood!!!  For drinks I had the Inka Cola - cool and refreshing.  It is sweet like a vanilla root beer like taste but yellow in color. :)))  My boyfriend ordered a Heineken at first and his second beer he took the suggestion of the waitress and ordered the Quilmes.  He said the Quilmes was very tasty.    They have a deli section filled with meats, desserts, sauces, sandwiches and also a store towards the back where you can buy the chimichurri sauce, Argentinian wine, candy, flour, dulce de leche sauce, carmel sauce,  etc etc.   It was a nice set-up.  My family is visiting in 3 weeks, I would definately take them here.  But we will be ordering the Argentinian meat barbecue!!!  :))))   I have had this before and it was yum, as well.",

    "text": "Being from Argentina, I love to find authentic Argentine restaurants that serve to-die-for melt in your mouth steaks. The solid reviews on Yelp gave me hope for a wonderful experience. The soft bread, flavorful chimmichurri, Buenos Aires salad, and beef empanada were spot on. The fries were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I ordered a fried egg with a soft yolk to dip the fries in and noshed on that tasty treat. When the filet mignon, my favorite cut, came out I could hardly wait! It looked beautifully done. While for most American's medium well is the standard, having a steak well-done is not atypical for Argentine steak; however without the more chewy toughness that comes from an American well-done steak. Most filets or adados  that I have  come out like butter well done. To my surprise, my filet mignon was tough and chewy. I had trouble cutting it with my sturdy steak knife. In fact the steak in a casino Mexican restaurant 2 days before had bested this by far. I was stumped about what to do as I hate to waste food, but this steak was so far off the mark of previous Argentine steaks and even non-Argentine steaks that I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites. Thankfully, the waitress was ultra accommodating and offered a different steak option, comped beverage and extra fries, and brought out a much more adequate New York strip. All the staff displayed gracious and accommodating demeanors with no attitude over the concern about the food. They more than made up for the snafu with the filet with their professional and pleasant customer service. I would come back next time I am in the area, Che!",

For the take and bake ones you can only get beef, chicken or Spinach, because the ham and cheese and corn empanadas are fried.  We always get the beef ones because they are my daughter's favorite. They will give you chimichurri sauce on the side to take home too, and they will even give you ice to keep your empanadas cold while you travel! :) Their chimichurri sauce is awesome, BTW, so don't forget to ask for it.  Empanadas heat up well at home in the oven. Paid around $10 for half a dozen. They are very friendly, but be patient because they can get busy, with only a handful of staff members.    P. S. Restroom is off to the side, past the market section.",

I will like to give them 5 stars , but because of a great miss I can't.  They just have to work with fulfilling your request on how you want your meat cooked. I ordered the Martin Fierro parrillada cooked Medium. I received my parrillada cooked Well Done.  I generally don't like complaining to the server for the fear of having  someone doing something \"funny\" to my food on my back. But, I don't like paying $50 plus dollars for a dinner with dry meat, I ordered mine medium because I want soft pink meat in the center. Filet mignon suppose to be the softest cut , but mine was the hardest cut on my parrillada to chew because I didn't  get any pink at all, just way over done meat. It wasn't  even medium well done.I understand the meat will continue cooking because they bring it on this charcoal grill to keep it warm.  I will definitely come back here sometime, but I will ask them carefully to give me a real medium cooked meat otherwise I will not take it.",

My friend and I shared the parrilada argentina,  which is an assortment of short ribs, skirt steak, sweet bread, regular sausage, and blood sausage, all grilled Argentine-style.  It was served to us sizzling hot with a side salad to balance things out.  The table was set with balsamic vinegar and olive oil condiments.    Everything was succulent, and both the skirt steaks and short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth tender.  But the star of this platter was the blood sausages.  Perfect for eating with the sweet breads.  The restaurant is perfect for family gatherings and sharing portions.  It's also a working butcher shop, with reasonably-priced meats on display and for sale out in the front.  If Anthony Bourdain's Buenos Aires episode made you crave for Argentine grilled meats, head to this place!",

    "text": "Dined here on 01/28/19.  First of all, when you walk in it's a little confusing, looks more like a deli than a restaurant. It took a few minutes for us to be noticed and seated. This is part of the reason I have 3 Stars.  The bread and chimichurri sauce you are given as an appetizer is AMAZING. In fact I plan to come back and buy a jar of it at some point. The bread was hot and fresh and they keep it coming!  For an appetizer we had a beef empanada-which were very good, especially with the chimichurri sauce. Here's where things got weird, we ordered the empanadas and were continuing to order our mains and the server walked away from the table. My boyfriend even said excuse me and the guy seemed not to hear. While the service wasn't rude (as others said in their reviews) it wasn't good either. The way I would describe it is that this place is a deli and then when people come in they have the butcher and chefs wait tables. I know that's probably an exaggeration but as an experienced server I felt that these guys had no idea what they were doing! Also, as our meal continued it became clear that the empanadas and the quiche we ordered were indeed cooked by our server. Probably the reason he kept leaving in the middle of us trying to order (happened 3 times).  But while I'm on this subject, the quiche is amazing, I would definitely recommend.  Next came the steak. It was great for the price. I'm not going to say it's the best steak I've ever eaten, because it's not, but it was great for a $23 filet mignon. We ordered it medium rare and it came medium, so maybe order down a cooking level? (I see other people had similar issues with over cooking). The taste of the steak was great and it was tender. Went well with this chimichurri as well!  Now besides the service, here was my other big problem. We ordered vegetables with our steak and the veggies that came with very clearly came from a can. The same brand my mom used to force me to eat as a child. For such a great \"from scratch\" place I expect way better from them. How hard is it to get some veggies and cook them?   All of this aside, the little market there is great and they have INKA COLA in cans which is amazing. While I probably won't be back for dinner, I'll be back to get some items from the deli counter and little market for sure!!!! Also, I will be buying their chimichurri sauce in bulk!",

Argentinian food is my favorite go to when I'm craving meat. They give you a variety of different meats when you order the BBQ platter. It's absolutely delicious! I also really enjoy their rice as a side. It's my favorite combination. Also love adding chili flakes and lots of lemon to the meat because it compliments the food so nicely.   They are a variety of wines and Argentinian beers you can try, I'm not a drinker but it's a nice option.",

The place is not fancy but it has that atmosphere that you feel some place in Argentina. Food is amazing and meat very good. It's always busy with large tables, sometime you have to wait a little bit it's worth it! Many Argentinian nationals go there, means food is good :) Before your order is served, they always offer bread they bake on site with some Chimichuri (parsley, garlic, spice & olive oil. Don't abuse it because you might not finish your meal LOL (talking from experience)  I recommend Meat Argentinian BBQ style, can please 2 to 4 persons. Their fries are very good. We order a pizza so family can share with a salad. Their sandwiches milanesa or choripan are delicious. It comes with a side of french fries. kids like their alfredo pasta. Hearts of palm / palmito is accompanied by some little dressing ketchup/mayonnaise  Finish your dinner with an expresso! Bon appetit",

The dipping sauce is fresh herbs and garlic that they bottle there, and you may slather your food in. They serve you a fresh basket of bread for the dipping and again it's on point.

    "text": "We are huge fans of the Brazilian steakhouses but they are so darn expensive and as we get older we just can't do these buffet style restaurants justice anymore. We feel like we're not quite getting our money's worth, especially when you have to pay for a child too. We heard about this place years ago and finally decided to check it out as a lower cost alternative, and that's the best way we can describe it. If you love the Brazilian meat style but don't want to break the bank, this is a good alternative. We got the meat sampler and it was really tasty, enough to feed my, my wife and my son but we're not that big eaters, might be more for two if you can pack in a ton of meat. We threw in a $6 side salad which was basic but good, came in a large bowl and was enough for about 3-4 servings. With the bread and chimichuri sauce (which was killer by the way and we packed in a couple servings), we had plenty of food for about $50. The three of us could hit a decent casino buffet in town and get a wider variety of food for about the same price but this is different, their meat is much better and worth it for the chimichuri sauce as an added bonus.  As others have said, having the huge deli counter as part of a restaurant is a bit odd. However, its really a simple, deli style restaurant to begin with, they focus on the quality of food not how fancy your table is and I'm ok with that. If you're looking for fancy or a special occasion, perhaps not the right place for you on that night. Seems like they get a lot of foot traffic purchasing food from the deli to go and you can't blame them, I'll probably be back to do the same as I've got to try those empanadas (not sure why we didn't grab some to go- dang!).",

We went for one of their mixed bbq grill plates which included filet mignon, short ribs, strip steak and what was called \"flap meat\" on the menu.  I asked the waitress if she could clarify \"flap meat\" but she was unable to.  All she said was \"It's hard to explain..but it's good!\". Fine..whatever.  I'll take the flap meat.  The dinner tables are just on the sides of this meat market/deli place so no need to dress up.  A wife beater would be totally acceptable here.    The meat was pretty good.  Quite filling with just a small side of Spanish rice although it could've been all the bread we ate when we first sat down.  Its such a weakness of ours!  I have to stop with the damn bread before the main course!  ANYWAYS...good place.  Enough meat for another meal.  We had a box full of it which we plan on using for omlettes and soup.  And the waitress was right!  That was some good flap!",

My husband and I had the meat grill for 2 with skirt steak, sausage, sweet breads, chicken breast, and short ribs. The skirt steak was my favorite. The sausage and chicken breast were also very good. Normally chicken breast has no flavor, but this chicken was tender and had a flavor that was so good that I can't describe it. The short ribs were not that good. My husband loved the sweet breads.   Obviously, the speciality here is the meat. Vegetarians may not want to come here.",

Their pastry Gologos is amazing, my first time trying it and it is addicting! Mate tea and Gologos are the perfect combo.The prices are fair and it is a wonderful experience.

I thought it was neat you could choose which sauce you want on it, red, white, or pink, I decided to be  adventurous and pick the color I hate, haha, and actually it ended up being like a vodka sauce which is my absolute favorite! I also had some salad which was pretty darn good.   Also I discovered chimichurri... oh my goodness! That stuff is amazing. Where have I been, under a rock! Probably... who knows, but dang. I am in love. Just give me bread and that and I will be all smiles!   My evening hear was pretty good, great company for sure, he ordered everything in Spanish which was pretty neat. I seriously need to get learn some Spanish so I can order and look cool doing it like he did. So easy it seems, but not for this girl.   Overall this place was nice, it had a deli, a small store like portion, and the service was good. Soccer or boxing playing in on the television!   Quaint little place!",

I recommend buying an order of the mixed meat when visiting for 2 to 4 people. It says its for 2 people but depending on how much sides you get this can definitely feed 3 maybe 4 people.  Their wine is good also its 7 bucks a bottle (if you wanna buy to go) and of course from argentina. You can purchase by the glass while eating as well.",

The ambiance was cute-- it's part deli, part restaurant, and part grocery.  Service was warm and friendly.  I was happy to be able to buy some alfajores (dulce de leche cookies) to take home.  I also appreciated their selection of South American sodas.  Unfortunately, the food just wasn't very good.  One of the things I crave more than anything is a provoleta.  This is provolone cheese seasoned with oregano and then grilled.  The provoleta here was small and tasted like it came out of a microwave.  It was sad and boring.  The empanadas I tried (we ordered one of each variety) were all blah.  The steak was a huge disappointment.  It was like an average supermarket steak that hadn't been properly cooked or seasoned.  It was grilled unevenly and the chimichurri was bland and boring.  I would not go back to Rincon de Buenos Aires unless I were just picking up items from the grocery selection.",

    "text": "Three of us went to Rincon a week ago, for a late lunch, after reading reviews about it. The place is in the Cathay Hills Chinese all, a few blocks west of the center of China Town, comfortable and service is good. We ordered the parillada for two people (the one that has skirt steak, ribs, sweet bread, chicken and sausage), a beef tongue and also a Greek salad. For drinks we had Quilmes beer. That was plenty of food for three people, but amazingly we finished it all, with more help later from glasses of house red wine.  We especially liked the grilled sweet bread. It is a little crunchy from grilling, tasty with a chargrill aroma, not mushy like in upscale French dishes. The skirt steak was very good too. We ordered it medium rare. It came slightly on the rare side, but because the grill has burning charcoal underneath, everything continues to cook at a slow pace, so the skirt steak became perfect just when we finished it. The ribs are so-so, not very good cut. Chicken is good, and sausage is tasty. But the best was the sweet bread. Oh, I liked the ox tongue as well. It was covered with chimichurri sauce. Oh yes, we ate so much bread before the grill came, because of the chimichurri sauce. It was good.  We recommend this place for people who go to Las Vegas and want something different from the buffets and Chinese food. We will go there again the next time we are in Vegas.",

We chose the combo which included flap meat, skirt steak and short rib. Everything came out perfectly cooked and at the right temp. Be sure to take all your meat off the grill if you don't want it well done by the time you get to the other pieces.   The combos come with a choice of potato salad, mixed green/lettuce or fries.  They season their beef with just S and P so use the chimichurri. It's fabulous, garlicky, herby, goes with everything including bread and French fries.   Pasta Alfredo was very creamy but needed more salt. But, who comes to an Argentinian place for pasta?  Answer:  kids ;). So, there's something for everyone in the family here.

A friend and I ordered beef empanadas to start and the Paradilla Martin Fiero. I also ordered some of their sangria. Well....if you're a beef lover then the Martin Fiero is the way to go. We ordered our meat medium rare and it's SO good. Nice and savory, the meat was so juicy. It comes with skirt steak, filet mignon, skirt steak and we chose the side of yellow rice. My favorite was probably the skirt steak. It's enough for two people, but we could have probably split a second one to be honest. The sangria was refreshing as well.  No complaints with the service and there was no wait on a Saturday night which was a pleasant surprise.",

It definitely came out on the rare end of that scale, but I'd rather have it more rare than more well. And it suggests that they are fairly confident in the quality of their meat. And, not without reason--it was a tasty steak. At under $20, a great deal.  I also had an empanada which I would say wasn't the best empanada I've had, but was solid.  Enjoyable restaurant to which I would return.",

    "text": "Do you really enjoy your food?  Can you distinguish \"tasty\" from \"delicious\" from \"magnificent\"?  If you're in Las Vegas, as a visitor, you can find plenty of tasty options all over town.  And on the Strip, you can be expected to fork out in the triple digits for a decent steak.  Prices are often inflated not because of the quality of the food but because of the decor and the staff who are all part time models.  So where you do you go to find magnificent food at a reasonable price with no wait and a truly wonderful atmosphere?  At New York New York or the Paris Hotel, miniature versions of the Chrysler Building and the Eiffel Tower are meant to make you feel like you are somewhere else.  At Rincon de Buenos Aires I felt like I had truly left Las Vegas and found my own personal heaven.    And what a special place.  Down to earth yet professional, amicable, relaxed, just a wonderful place.  It's off the beaten path and unassuming yes, but sometimes this is where you have to search to unearth True gems.  I was gripped by the aroma of slow grilled meats that enveloped me when I walked in.  The hostess was polite and more than happy to accommodate us despite our large group... it was packed on a Sunday night!  If you like malbecs you'll be in heaven... well priced and delicious, several to chose from (I counted at least 6), and a far cry better than what you'll see on the strip.  We ordered empanadas and doused them in chimichurri sauce.  We also ordered ensalada mixta to accompany the meats; straightforward, light, crisp and fresh... just add olive oil and balsamic.    Now the meat.  We ordered the parillada for two (Martin Fierro) including filet mignon, short ribs, flap meat and skirt steak.  The filet mignon was just right.  The skirt steak was compact and easy to cut, but ample in size and the taste was superb.  I would actually say my favorite was the flap meat though!  The short ribs were a nice wild card, a bit more fatty and great flavor too.  We actually ordered two parilladas and that was enough for five people.  My favorite side is believe it or not the French fries but only bc we had ordered a salad already.  This restaurant exceeded our expectations.  They earned all five stars .  Everybody here is sitting around staring at everybody else's food until their own arrives.  It's just terrific.  If you like steak you had better head over here.   You don't need reservations and you don't have to pay for parking!  I'll be back any time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Call me crazy. I love a restaurant that doubles as a market. Plus points for being a restaurant and market with great wine.   Rincon is one of those places that I always leave happy, but often forget about. Prior to my last two recent visits, I was last there at least three years ago.   If you want a nice, clean, meat-centric meal, this should be on your shortlist. My husband and I may venture off to new appetizers or sides, but we always order a parrilla, which offers a selection of meats served on a sizzling grill with a side of stunningly delicious chimichurri. Our preferred parrilla is the Martin Fiero, which includes skirt steak, filet, and flanken short ribs. Pro tip: order your meat just under how you like it since there is definitely carryover cooking to be expected. The meat is always tender, juicy, and ready to be doused in chimichurri.   The Ensalada Argentino is a great accompaniment to the parillas, especially if you're keto (#waroncarbs) or just looking for something crisp to counter the fattiness.  One of my favorite sides or additions is the mojellas (grilled sweetbreads served with lemon, garlic, and parsley). Simply delectable. I also encourage adding a chorizo or morcilla (blood sausage).  Unless I'm carb-restricted, I'll use the bread provided with the meal to sop up meat juices and chimuchurri or to make folded sandwiches with my feast of meats.   My in-laws came with us on our last visit and ventured into the entrees instead of the parrilas. My mother-in-law is a super lover of Italian food. She ordered the lasagna while I sat and hoped she'd like it. She loved it. She ate the entire plate, all the while commenting on how good every element of it was. My father-in-law ordered the breaded steak covered in tomato sauce and cheese. Aside from the fact that my father-in-law has a tendency to order things covered in tomato sauce and then later comments on how tomato sauce gives him heartburn, he enjoyed it.   The empandas here are great, too. I just haven't been able to have them because #waroncarbs.   Anyway, on to the interior. It's just so cute. While you're waiting for your food, you can peruse the meats, cheeses, wines, and various Argentine pantry staples available for purchase. And you can almost always enjoy a soccer game on the TV.   Oh and there's a nice selection of Argentine beer and wine available, too.   As for price, this comes in cheaper than a visit to an All-You-Can-Eat salty meat feast (I'm looking at you Texas De Brazil), with better quality food. In my opinion, this is the superior option. And it's local. Come on, people.",

The meat cuts on that platter were the best we've had in a while. We ordered additional skirt steak ala carte...because it was hands down the best cut we've tasted in a while.

I've driven past them numerous times and never considered going in until I read the reviews. They are located in the same plaza as Hong Kong Garden. (formerly Cathay House)  The outside might seem lackluster but the inside is pretty clean albeit a bit dark. They have a deli counter filled with various deli meats, cheeses, and empanadas! Try the cheese or ham & cheese one. They have a more flaky, deep fried crust versus the baked shell on the beef/chicken empanadas.   I like to place take out but I noticed most customers are sit in diners. The staff is friendly and prompt, dine in customers get a free bread basket with a chimmichurri oil dipping sauce that I like. The menu is extensive with sandwiches, pasta, various meats, salads, etc. So far I've only tried several of their sandwiches (Cuban, chicken) but they've all been good.   If you can't dine in at least pick up some of their empanadas.",

We ordered a few meals, starting from Filet minon (Lomito), The classic Argentinian Choripan (chorizo and bread) and alfajores de maicena, which are extremely soft cookies sandwiches with Dulce de Leche. The meats were phenomenal, the accompanying chimichurri enhanced their delicious flavor. The Argentinian alfajores melted in our mouths. My wife ordered a cafe con leche, and she enjoyed it very much with alfajores.  At the end of our visit, we walked to the store section of the shop and grabbed some Dulce de Leche, Yerba, Mate Cocido. They have a great selection of Argentinean cookies, dulce de Leche, yerbas, fresh pasta and tapas de empanadas, there was meat on display with classic Argentinean cuts for sale.

The sandwich was o.k., but lacked flavor. The French fries are really good. The lasagna was good, but not the best in Vegas. The meats are cooked perfectly and is probably the main reason to come to this restaurant. Got a jar of Chimichurri and a container of Palmeras.

    "text": "Well, let me start by admitting the main reason I come to Rincon de Buenos Aires is because of the Quilmes. It is in my opinion the best import from Argentina other than the Argentine women of course. Ok, ok, I'll keep it food related. The rice taste really good, the way they cook it....mmm. It goes with every dish pretty much. I have had la pechuga, which is the chicken breast and it was delicious, somehow the flavor is different than what I had tried before in traditional U.S. American restaurants. Maybe is just me but the meats tend to be cooked to perfection in here, whether is beef, chicken or seafood.  It is also a deli, they sell meats and other Argentinian treats for you to take home and prepare. This restaurant is not big or fancy but when the food is this good, you won't mind at all. There are a couple of TVs usually showing soccer games or boxing fights happening. The place is very casual and clean, the service is prompt and the people here seem nice.  Give it a try, I have a feeling you'll feel the same way. For you gentlemen who like to enjoy a beer, get a Quilmes and by the time you finish it, you'll be a fan.",

When you come to Vegas and want the best Argentine food (or superb Italian food) come here - the variety of food is superb (best empanadas outside of Chicago I ever had, and the best grilled sweetbreads I ever had), they have both Argentine grill, pizza and even fish options (my fiancee feels it is the best lasagne in a restaurant,. I would have to agree). All of it is great - and leave room for dessert, the flan with the caramel is the best I ever had. I cannot rave enough of this place - when I go west next time, I will stop by Vegas and eat most of my meals here PS - did I mention the prices, very reasonable (even the superb malbec by the glass or bottle)",

They sell these crackers that he used to eat as a child in Argentina.  And he swore by their desserts.  He was convinced that there's a little Argentinian grandmother in the back making the desserts.  He said their flan is 100% authentic Argentinian, not the typical flan we get over here in the States.  I had the seafood plate, which I swear, except for the fact that there was no fish, it was the best cioppino I've ever had, which I've had at several restaurants at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  This was sooo much better.  The husband had the \"choripan\" which he raved about.  We stopped off on our way back to L.A. to pick up more desserts and pastries.  Yep, they're that good!",

Their Chimichurri sauce is amazing (hope you love garlic) and is served on the table with bread or you can use with your meal.  We had the Ceasar salad with just the right amount of dressing and a Mixed Grille (for 2).  The mixed grille was cooked to perfection and the flavor was True Argentinian, absolutely amazing!  There was also a deli and little market to get items to go.  I was traveling so didn't get anything but there were a lot of items I would love to try.  Next time I am in Vegas, I definitely will go back.  It is a must try!",

I knew from the beginning when I opened the foam plate the smell of decomposed that had . My wife told me I had to return that food . But You know What People. I preferred to let them know what You are exposing Yourselves to go to this place . its okay I pay nearly $ 25 dollars for an old ruined food . I work in a restaurant . in my work these kinds of things are unforgivable . because a restaurant depends on how the customer is satisfied .to make many customers.I will not return the food . but never return to this place . first and last time !!",

A quirky blend of deli and cafe, Rincon boasts lots and lots of meat.  Protein central!  My party ordered the grilled meat assortment, presumably for 2 people, but easily fed 4 adults and 3 kiddos with leftovers.  For funsies, we also tried the sweetbreads and tongue, along with more kid-friendly sides like the fries, rice, empanadas (VERY good), and oregano-sprinkled tomatoes.  Everything was delicious and everyone was stuffed...but not so stuffed for dessert.  Try the alfajores (shortbread cookies sandwiched together with dulce de leche) -- SO YUMMY.    Your meal will come with free bread and the awesome chimichurri sauce (comprised of herbs, garlic and vinegar).  I think I could dip almost anything into that sauce and I'd eat it.  None of us had time constraints, which was good, since the service was definitely on the relaxed side....however, a lovely first visit and great food.  I'd come again!",

It's a \"community\" meal (around $30, lotsa meat), so for 2-4 people, is a good choice. Have to mention that the service was absolutely fantastic, friendly and warm.

The empanadas were good but not the best i've had.",

My friend and our party decided to stay against my desires. I based my opinion strictly on it being a deli. I wanted a good steak and to feel special. I am super glad we stayed. We sat at a quaint table with white linens. I ordered the Parrillada Martin Fierro and shared it with my friend. It was amazing! I am not a meat eater; nonetheless, I finished all of it! We ordered a resonably priced wine from Argentina, it was good. Our friends ordered the Ribeye. Raviolo, and mashed potatos. The only thing I tried of their's was the mashed potatos, they were just okay. The spices with oil that was brought with the bread was excellent, I bought two bottles to take home. It's a very casual and family style restaraunt. Five stars for the steak, but considering the overall food and ambiance experience, I give it four stars. Very resonably priced. I will definitely be returning!",

We also left a nice tip because the owners here are so nice and friendly and answering the phone with my questions before they were open at 9am this morning.   Delicious sandwiches.  The bread for the sandwiches is also homemade too.  That's yummy also.  Will come back here next time to try other items on the menu.

    "text": "Rincon de Buenos Aires was busy when I arrived around 6:40 PM. Immediately detected an overwhelmed staff, to the point of antagonizing, as if my mere presence had driven them over the edge, but since I know moody, and have dealt with moody, I did not let this deterred me from my quest to buy mil hojas and empanadas. Neither were worth praising, but the mil hojas specially was the biggest disappointment. Mil Hojas is a highly regarded South American staple, which Argentina is widely known to prepare deliciously, among other versions like in Chile (amazingly good as well), Peru also makes them good.  What is essential in the preparation of Mil Hojas is the Dulce de Leche, known in its higher form as Manjar Blanco. Prepared with wholesome milk , but now a days, more and more often, condensed milk, which by boiling unopened turns darker and solidifies, and now is also called Dulce de Leche, which in a way is a valid name.  The real one used to be made with combinations of high grade milks and sugar, and several hours of stirring with a wooden paddle, under a medium size fire, to prevent any burning at the bottom of a huge copper based container. That method is way in the past, and very rare these days. Now just boil the cans and you can still call it Dulce de Leche, but any combination short of that, and your Mil Hojas suffer. Nutella, Caramel, fake copies and you  no longer have a worthy creation. Rincon de Buenos Aires cut enough corners in the making of their Mil Hojas, that their version is a discredit to real Mil Hojas everywhere. 1.5 Stars. Their Empanadas are edible, but the dough needs finesse, and the fillings too. How about some remedial training back home, where empanadas and mil hojas are second to none. So let's review: pissy service, terribly wrong mil hojas, and overpriced average at best empanadas. Sometimes, I've come to find out, the negative reviews are not necessarily the enemy of good eating, but instead the most sober and accurate of the opinions. Yes, there is the slight chance that all the rest of their extensive menu is nothing short of 5 Stars food, but one would have to be a little gullible to buy in to that line of thinking, with the righteous exception if one is Argentinian, for they are known to be supportive and loyal to all things displaying their country of birth. In that case, expect plenty of 5 Stars, like any patriotic citizen would be likely to rate, whichever country it may be. Not a mirage score, but a real one. 2 Stars.",

Highest of recommendations for the lomito completo sandwich, prepared with filet mignonette and a fried egg. It's the bomb. It's served with pommes frites that are perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, with just the right amount of salt.   In addition to these two spectacular items, you are served a house baguette with chimmichurri sauce. The bread is good preparation for what to expect for your sandwich- a roll that is simultaneously crunchy outside, and soft inside without being undercooked, or doughy. The chimmichurri sauce is phenomenal, and great to dip your frites in as well.  Lastly, I cannot recommend the house sangria enough. It is made on site and is the perfect blend of fruit juices and wine to make a strong alcoholic yet palatable drink that you can probably drink endlessly. I know I did. A pitcher will get you six glasses, FYI.   Service was top notch, our server was attentive and helpful, and available without being annoying, it didn't hurt that he was also good looking.",

We always get the combination mixed bbq  ($37) with short ribs, strip steak, filet mignon and flap meat.  The meat is tender and juicy and served with a delicious chimichurri sauce.  Even the salads fit in our diet since you just dress it with olive oil and vinegar.  We went back and tried an all you can eat korean bbq recently, the alternative was Rincon.  We regretted going to the AYCE korean bbq, the meat quality doesn't match up with this place and it was more expensive.  So, if your looking for a different place to pig on out meat...this is your place.  On a side note, we really enjoyed the salad with the palm hearts, great addition to all the meat.  This is a pretty casual place since it's a deli/restaurant, so don't plan a romantic date night here.  We don't eat bread, but the complimentary bread looked pretty decent.  The only thing kind of lacking is service, we had a hard time getting our water refilled.  The servers also work behind the deli counter as well.",

Located along Spring Mountain somewhere in Chinatown, you'll find this unassuming place.  It's in the same complex as Cafe de Japon and Cathay House.  They have a few tables and there was only 1 server when we went here - he did try his best to provide good service to all the diners so I can't fault him for that.  We were given a basket of bread with an amazing cup of chimuchurri on the side.  That's it, end of review!    But wait, I still have to share the other fantastic parts of the meal.  We had the empanadas (a beef, a chicken and a spinach) which were yummy.  I liked the chicken empanada the most.  The crust wasn't as crisp as the Spanish empanadas I'm used to but the filling was great.  We also got the parrillada Martin Fierro (short ribs, filet mignon, skirt steak and flap meat) with a side of papas fritas de provenzal (garlic fries).  The meats were so tender, juicy and packed with flavor then dip it in chimichurri?  Oh my goodness!  Intense tastebud experience!  The papas fritas were warm, crisp and garlicky.  For dessert I finished a mixto flan by myself.  The syrupy flan kind of looks strange but it's good.  It came with a side of crema chantilli and dulce de leche.  Eating the flan wih the dulce de leche was divine!  This Real Madrid fan gives Rincon De Buenos Aires 5 stars (even though Messi's our rival)!",

Honestly I think those were the stars for me bc they had nice charred crisp edges but were so tender inside and maybe the skirt steak is third. Beef empenada was so good too and of course everything was drenched in chimichurri which made it 10x better, in fact I was practically drinking it with every bite. Best Argentinian food experience I've ever had instead of those stupid buffets where they come around cutting meats for u. They literally put a hot sizzling grill right on the table that keeps the meat hot throughout the whole meal. The flan is so good too and not super dense nor too sweet which I like. The dulce de leche is a nice little touch and definitely sweet but on the side so I could nibble here and there. Awesome food!!!!",

Usually I get the skirt steak (Entrana) but this time we went with Parradilla Argentina that included: skirt steak for 2 (about 3 oz each), two portions of short ribs, 2 sausages, 1 morcilla (blood sausage) and sweetbreads.  We ordered a side of yellow rice to accompany.  Bread and chimichurri sauce came first followed shortly by the main.  They brought it out on a small barbeque so if you like yours a little more done, just let it cook (we ordered it medium rare to start).  I added a little chimi sauce to the sweetbreads and it enhanced most excellently (after trying it naked first, of course).  The prices compared to anything on the strip are a bargain.  The atmosphere is similar to any deli you'll find in South America, with a deli case next to your tables and tv's showing futbol.  Do yourself a favor and try this place.",

    "text": "I have driven by Rincon countless times and was amused by the name in big letters and below a small sign saying Italian deli.  It didn't seem to go together, but I get it now.  They have more than just Argentinian food but that's the highlight.  It's the corner storefront of this U shaped shopping plaza in Chinatown, hence the name.  I came here with a friend for a late morning lunch and we ordered and shared many items from the menu.  We were brought some bread and chimichurri.  The spices in the chimichurri were very good and went well on the bread and some meat we had later on.  We started with an order of provoletta--grilled provolone cheese topped with chili and the chimichurri spices.  We took our knives and dug in and pulled up some cheese that hung like melted cheese will.  I put the cheese on my bread.  Vary tasty and great start.  We then got the order of three empanadas--one ham and cheese, one chicken, and one corn and cheese.  All three were good.  I liked the chicken the most.  The crust was flaky and thin.  The amount of filling for the three was perfect.  Then came the main course--a Parrillada Argentina, a mixture of grilled meat.  Ours consisted of three sausages, sweet bread, skirt steak, and short ribs.  It was perfect for sharing.  We each had a length of short rib, one white sausage each, we shared the one black sausage (blood sausage or blood pudding are two names for it) and we each had a skirt steak.  We got all the meat cooked medium.  The skirt steak was a little tough but it was tasty.  The chimichurri added to the meat.  The grilled meats were really very good.  My favorite here was the blood sausage.  It's the first time I've had it and it was quite good.  Then we ordered four desserts to share--dulce de leche flan, an alfajor, a Mil Hojas, and a pasta frola.  While all four were excellent, I had two favorites here--the mil hojas and the alfajor.  I'd had an alfajor once before and it was good to have this sweet cookie once again and the mil hojas had a great filling of chocolate and the spice, which we couldn't quite place was cardamon our server told us.  The flan was very soft and the pasta frola--quince tart--was also quite good.    Service was great!  Our server was a delightful young woman who answered questions and always had a pleasant smile.  She refilled our water glasses several times.  A great meal with a good friend--that's what Saturdays are for--or any other day of the week ending in y.",

It loses a star with me because the service was a touch slow (the restaurant was maybe a quarter full is all) and the vegetables ordered as sides were weak. (In order to carry as a side dish of their own, a plate of summertime tomatoes absolutely should not taste like weak winter tomatoes. The fried potatoes weren't quite \"there\" in their texture--a little soggy.) And the portions were just a touch small for the price. Still, the parillada was a good eating experience and we'd come back for that.",

We came here last night at 5pm and were a party of 6 and the service was slow than I expected and it was not that crowded.  After we gave our orders, bread and chimichurri sauce came first followed shortly by the main.  I liked the chimichurri sauce.  I had the ham and cheese Empanadas which was good. The sandwich I had was Milanese and it was a little fry and the portions are huge and the prices compared to anything on the strip are not too pricey.    The atmosphere is similar to a deli. My friend had the steak that came with a choice of potato, soup, salad, or mixed vegetables.    I like their Tiramisu. Despite the fact I was not jumping up and down for their food,  I would come back and try something else.",

    "text": "This place is a cute authentic little Argentinian/ Italian restaurant and market that sticks out like a sore thumb in the heart of Chinatown in the Cathay Hills Plaza center. My boyfriend, is half Italian and Argentinian and he was eager to try this place out for dinner.     When we walked in, the restaurant/market smelled delicious! It didn't help that we were starving and wanted to order everything on the menu. Luckily the server quickly brought out complimentary bread and homemade chimichurri. We both wished the bread was warm or toasted, but it wasn't - it was room temperature. The bread wasn't the best or the freshest, but the chimichurri certainly made up for it. The chimichurri was flavorful and had a nice acidity to it.    We ended up with 4 different hot baked empanadas $2.25 each:  Beef - Very rich and meaty flavor, my boyfriend like this one the most. 4/5  Spinach - thick spinach and cheese filling. I enjoyed this one. 4/5  Corn - piping hot insides and tasted similar to creamed corn - just not as sweet. 2/5  Ham & cheese - this one also had a very hot and gooey cheese filling and ham bits. This is one of my favorites. 4/5  Also we shared a rather huge hot sandwich - Lomito Completo $10.99: Not worth $11 - A very thin hammered down piece of mignon with melted provolone cheese, very salty ham, fried eggs, lettuce, tomato, mayo, on a baguette bread. The steak and ham were thin and way over salted. The salt was so strong that it offended my taste buds. The fried egg was overcooked so it didn't have a runny yolk and that's always a shame in my book. The sandwich was a generous size in a huge bread roll. We were only able to tackle a half of it. The fries that accompanied it were nice, hot and crispy, just the way I like my fries. I just couldn't get past the over salting issue - I could feel my mouth shriveling up. 2/5  We also ordered 1 soda. Our total damage was $25 and change.   In the end, we were uncomfortably full - everything was extremely heavy, oily, and extra salty. I did appreciate their empanadas, but the hot sandwich was a hot salty mess.",

Humble decoration featuring many Argentinian pictures and arts, which gave me a nostalgic Tango feeling.  Wide range of meat cuts, charcuteries, cheese and sweets (including heaven alfajores). I ordered empanadas as appetizers, and I went for a rare grilled ribeye steak, morcilla and a salad (tomato, egg and carrot). Taste, texture and aroma were just heaven, awesome and an inspiration to the senses. A glass of red wine was a perfect match to the meat. And to finish a perfect dinner, I order a delicious flan with dulce de leche (Argentine style) with coffee.  Indeed, a truly gem in Las Vegas!!! Can't wait to get back.  Area of improvement: I would like to have more variety of greens such as Arucula, Chards, and Kale to accompany the meats.",

Ravioli - Wife hated it - said the sauce tasted sour Salmon - daughter felt is was overdone.  Woke up the next morning vomiting up half digested fish.  No temperature so it must have been the food.  We suspect the fish was bad and they overcooked it to hide this. Chorizo appetizer - tasty but overcooked Skirt steak with cheese and tomato sauce topping. My son loved it.

It was very tasty but  i actually think it's an overload - not just the amount  of food, but it's taste overload.  the fact is, as tender as a filet can be, it ain't high on the flavor scale so the ham and egg were the dominant tastes and then when you dip it in the sauce - wow !  It's funny that there is a sign outside the place - \"italian deli\"  - and yes, most of the deli meats and cheeses are italian.  But that's ok by me !  I gotta hit this place again and try the mixed grills with the chimichurri sauce - YUMMY !!",

The food was delicious, I had the garlic fries and steak sandwich with fried egg (forgot the name).  The bread they initially serve with the oil and seasoning is a delightful appetizer...and everything is in huge portions! I will be back to try everything on the large menu - it all looks mouth watering!",

They have pretty flat out awesome sandwiches, that wont break the bank and are a welcome shake up in flavor from other places in the area.  Its worth a shot, and if you dont dig it, you will only be set back about 12 bucks, which unless your a bum is not big deal...so go!",

    "text": "We visited this restaurant last night on a whim, having decided to just drive through Chinatown and find a place that looked interesting. We made it all the way to Koreatown on Spring Mountain before we decided to backtrack and try out the \"Argentinian' place.  Since we weren't particularly hungry, we thought that we'd just peruse the menu and pick out a few appetizers. As soon as we saw the guarana and the Belgium-made mango juice, we realized that this wasn't an ordinary deli/restaurant. My son had the lasagna, which he enjoyed, and the rest of us shared the Parrillada Martin Fierro, which was one of the shared BBQ options. The meat was a little better than average, which is probably why it's priced so \"reasonably\", but what really sold it was the fragrance wafting from the cooker plunked down in front of us. That, in combination with the free flowing bread and chimichurri sauce, made it an enjoyable experience that we look forward to replicating in the future.  We were too full by the end of our meal to try out any of the desserts, but they did look delicious.",

So, when we found this place she was very excited to go and show me some of the food she fell in love with while there. When I first went in I was terrified cuz, lets be honest, its kind of a grungy dark place. But we sat down and got some bread with the chimichurri sauce and I was hooked. I cant tell you how good that stuff is. If I didnt think that I would get a horrible case of the runs I would pour it on my ice cream and stir it into my drinks. We got some milanesas and empanadas and they were AMAZING! The empanadas were so delicious that I often find my mind drifting to the wonderful moments where I placed the fine morsels of food on my tongue and remembering how my tongue had never felt more loved than at that moment.  I recommend this place to everyone. The owner is amazingly nice and the food is fantastic.",

My Argentine friends took me to this place and introduced me to great treats. We tried their saladas and two different Parrilladas.     The Parrilladas come with different types of grilled meats. Some I loved, and some were not for me. But it was great to try everything.      And yes, as Gianna mentioned below, The Chimichurri is awesome. Good service and very good food, plus you get to check out the deli and maybe take some treats to enjoy at home.",

It has everything from a deli with wonderful cheeses, olives and other items you rarely see any where esle to a small mart where you can buy good quality olive oil and especially malta(goes good with rum).  They do have a menu to order from with a few tables.    My wife and I love to go in for a quick grab n go lunch.  We usually order the Empanadas and grab a couple of maltas to go.  They staff is always very helpful and nice.  Also in you are into soccer, its a great place to go on a weekend to have a sit down lunch and watch a game or two.  Again, if you are looking for something new, check this place out.  Oh yeah, try the chimmichurri, its awsome(you can buy a jar for like 5 bucks(well-worth it)",

    "text": "Oh man, how we love Rincon de Buenos Aires!   When you walk in the door of this very unassuming little restaurant/deli/mercado, you'd never expect that this restaurant is home to some of the best asado outside of South America...and it is. I haven't had morcilla or molleja this legit since I spent a summer in Uruguay, and it's a good bet that I won't find its equal anywhere else.  Rene and Mariano always take great care of us; they make sure that bread and chimichurri are never in short supply, and that drinks are always full.   The Noquis (gnocchi) are heavenly, especially with the rosado sauce. Tasty, baked empanadas. A half of one lomito completo sandwich will bust my gut - filet mignon sandwich with cheese, lettuce, tomato, ham, and a fried egg.   And then, if you drink yerba mate, they have a great selection of brands that you can buy by the kilo. We're talking Canarias and Cruz de Malta, for 6 dollars. No $8 ten oz bags of fru-fru whole-foods mate here!   To sum up - this is our favorite restaurant in all of Las Vegas.  Eating dinner here was my brother's only request when he came to visit from Austin, TX. Tell your friends!",
