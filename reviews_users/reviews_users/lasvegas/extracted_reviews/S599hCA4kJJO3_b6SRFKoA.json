    "text": "Ate here last Sunday for AYCE/D brunch.   The ambiance was nice, the staff attentive and the margaritas and mimosas were flowing for those that wanted them (and they didn't go light on the alcohol in those drinks either)!  I enjoyed the variety and freshness of what they had out for the taking, which not only included some Michoacan flavored Mexican dishes, but a couple main stay brunch items such as bacon and sausage.  The shrimp cerviche stood out as memorable, as did a tender beef dish I do recall the name of. Actually, everything I sampled tasted very good.  If you want any of their freshly made tortillas (corn or flour) you have to ask your waiter / waitress for them. A couple at our table bitched about this, but after I explained that if they left them out at the buffet line they would either end up dried out or soggy, depending on how they were left out, they understood and enjoyed them fresh off the grill.  Although the staff sport their \"gringo\" shirts I was not offended (takes a lot to offend this white boy), but it could others:  gringo  (r)  -- n  , pl -gos  a person from an English-speaking country: used as a derogatory term by Latin Americans    We would eat here again, should any future stay in Vegas accommodate the detour.",

Ok no problem, got our drinks with in 15 min ok it's busy, no big deal. Orderd our food , had guacamole for a app. Made at the table was great, a little chunky  and under seasoned, I'm ok still staying possitve for a good day, no silverware or napkins at the table, ask the waiter to bring some. Puts a pile of forks spoons and knives in the middle of the table. Ok still staying possitve. Then the wait, 38 min ( yes I was timing)  I asked the waiter about the time and said it was coming. 10 min later food came, everyones food was warm at best. Not a good experience for a specail day. If it's a matter of being busy should have not seated people. This location is closed for me.",

The place wasn't busy and guests who arrived after we did got their food first, the waiter was interested in serving as many cocktails as he could for happy hour instead of waiting on us. The manager who was walking around could also care less. When our food finally came out it was burnt after waiting an hour for it. Very disappointed from a place that was hailed as excellent with great waiters.",

    "text": "What do \"Hotel California\", \"Stairway To Heaven\", easy listening music, and Spanish guitar have in common? Lindo Michoacan. There was a great assortment of reworked classic rock playing softly throughout the restaurant today. It was a nice touch to an already beautiful restaurant. There in no shortage of painting and carved wood at this place. And so the afternoon started well enough.  I began my lunch with the traditional chips and salsa with bean dip thrown in for good measure. So far so good.  Next came the sopa de fideo. Its like Lipton noodle soup only better and perfect on a cold day like today. For my meal I ordered chicken fajitas. They came out quick enough. My respect started waining when I saw only two under cooked tortillas for what looked like a large portion of fajita fixings. It turned out there was just enough chicken, rice and beans to wrap in two tortillas. Yet there was more than enough pepper and onion to go around. I ended up eating those plain with a fork after my chicken and tortillas were gone. The flavor was lacking. I like more citrus flavor in chicken fajitas so I squeezed the lemon from my iced tea over the sizzling skillet for that sour boost of flavor. During this meal I couldn't help but think of giving Michoacan a 3 star rating as much as it pained to do so. Then came dessert.  I ordered flan which, I was told by who appeared to be the manager, was \"heavenly.\" I'll be the judge of that. I've had some good flan at many other restaurants in the past. This better be special. It  was.  It was firm and thick yet velvety soft. Rich. Decadent. Creamy. I don't know how to better describe it. It really was one of the best flans I've had anywhere. And there it was, the boost I so desperately needed to give them a deserved 4 stars.",

The server took it back and within 5 minutes I had the correct order. My food however was not as delicious as my husbands. Everything was pretty bland. The enchilada was flavorless, the tamale had very little pork and was mushy, and the rice was plain. We will most likely return, but definitely getting the burrito or tacos.",

I always figure, if the restrooms are spotless, that's probably indicative of the cleanliness of the cooking areas.

The ONLY complaint is that the entry to wait is so tiny and gets backed up but the outside area is huge and has pillars to sit  to wait and perfect if you have kids to run around. It's not like there are tons of screaming kids and is dark so can be a nice little date place but oerfect for family dinner too. They cater too for events! Btw if you wait outside ,just let the host know so they don't skip you when you're called. They get busy because it's good! LIndo resturaunts have been a well known family owned resturaunt name in town for years. This location is smaller but great service. Their pick up service is super fast and always right and good. Even the sides and extras. My fam has eaten at the original for years (before the original fire even in the 90's) I can remember being a kid watching them make handmade tortillas. All the locations are good but my favs have to be the original location and this centennial location. FYI it's next to Red Robin (it can be hard to see from street but has same parking location). Cute dark place and covered seating outside avail w/ heated lamps in the winter if needed on patio area. Has a great little bar inside too.  Staff is very nice. This place has lots of regulars. Because it's very good and they treat their guests good. We have them cater our Christmas dinner every year and it's so easy and good. I think if the order is over a certain amount they even deliver for catering but I'd check on that. Also the best desserts are the sopapillas! Yumm, this review made me so hungry that I just called to order pick up :0 Enjoy!",

My husband and I went here with our one year old twins and requested seating for two adults and two high chairs.  We were sat in a booth with no high chairs and then a gentleman came and tried to hand us booster seats.  I explained I couldn't use booster seats and that I needed high chairs.  He told us that we couldn't have them.  I told him we would literally have to leave if they couldn't give us high chairs and he shrugged his shoulders.  I was pretty angry by this point, especially because my one year olds would have fallen out of booster seats and hurt themselves.  A waiter saw I was frustrated and came and asked what was wrong.  I explained that we were told we could not have high chairs and he magically appeared with two and said I just needed to ask the right person.  While I appreciated his help i didn't appreciate the rude treatment by the first staff member and I still don't understand why we were told we couldn't have high chairs in the first place.  It honestly ruined our dinner but we were there so we ordered, ate, and left as quickly as possible.  I did send an email to their customer service email regarding this matter and never received a return response.  Needless to say we won't be dining here again and I would advise families with littles to go elsewhere",

So accommodating, friendly, and gracious.  We asked for recommendations on the menu and he nailed it!  The meal was gorgeous.  I had the Chicken with Rajas Y Crema (Chiles, onion, and cream.)  Just divine . My husband had the Carne Asada with Al Cilantro sauce.  Another awesome dish.  And The churros.   They should be illegal!  All in all, a delightful meal.  Cesar especially made the visit perfect.",

We both ordered carne asada burritos and they were delicious. They were super stuffed with meat and it was super flavorful. Would definitely come back again to try something else!",

I had the filete relleno. It is a white fish battered, fried and stuff with seafood like shrimp, octopus, etc. It is topped with a zesty mayo sauce that is flavorful and has a hard, slicy punch. The dish is served with more pinto beans, Spanish rice, and guacamole on top of rice. Everhthing tasted fresh except for the dry Spanish rice. It looked like they had put a can of mixed vegetables in it as well. Who wants peas in their Spanish rice?! Overall, the dish is pricy but worth it.   Their tortillas are authentic and well made. I have been taught how to make tortillas and these exhibit all the necessarily attributes.   For dessert try their churros. The cinnamon sugar, caramel sauce and whip cream are heavenly. Yes, that was the Yelp coupon they offered.",

You'd think they would want to take care of something like that right away. They really need to step up their game here.

There were about 7of us including 2toddlers. Everyone was so sweet and patient. The owner or manger even came out and asked how everything was.   Almost every meal has come with a soup. My kids love it.  I love enchiladas, theirs aren't the best. I think it's the sauce.. idk.. My husband gets the burrito bionico. It's huge, he loves it. And I'd say He's a burrito expert.   The complimentary chips are always fresh, they give you yummy Salsa, not too spicy, very tasty. They also give you a bean dip. I'm not a fan of beans but i love their bean dip.   Fresh tortillas  They give you a free warm churro if you can pronounce one of the Mexican countries. That was fun.   Every hostess, server, has been very attentive.

My daughter and I went to the restroom and it was very dirty. Paper products were all over the floor and toilets. Second, my daughter ordered a chicken enchilada, she received beef. We informed our server and just decided to share the food I had instead of waiting to remake hers. (She's 6, so there's no time for waiting.) At the end we ordered a piece of cheesecake to go. Got home, and what a huge disappointment for $6.50. It'll most likely be a while before I give it another go. I normally bypass this establishment and head to Red Robin.",

The hostess is always friendly as was our waiter this time. Fresh chips, warm bean dip and tortillas being made just a few feet away.  The bad: ordered a chicken enchilada but was served beef. When I brought it to the waiter's attention, he informed me I could find chicken in the other half of the enchilada and then walked away. Really?   The ugly: the sopa tarasca was extra oily. So much so, I could only take a few bites. We asked for the check three times and every time was told \"oh my god I'm so sorry\". 45 minutes later we got our check after our party of four stood up to walk out because we couldn't wait for it anymore.  Three stars because aside from the oily soup, everyone enjoyed their food. Even my beefy chicken enchilada.",

And after eating here the quest continues. The 2 stars instead of 1 is strictly for the service. We were seated immediately and were brought chips and salsa and had our drink order taken by a very friendly bus boy. The waiter was friendly. Otherwise, this place would have gotten 1 star. I am very picky with my food. I hate lettuce. I can't eat anything that lettuce has touched. I can't even handle it on my plate. I ordered a chicken taco with chicken and cheese only and a cheese enchilada with cheese and red sauce only. Of course my food came out covered in lettuce. The waiter brought me a new taco and apologized. But, the chicken was cold and dry. The bus boy took my drink to refill and never returned, but he was working really hard so i assume it was an honest mistake. My husband had the flautas and said they were ok, but not very flavorful. The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal and they were just decent. The beer was $6 for a small glass. We won't be returning considering I was still hungry when we left.",

The \"buffet\" was small and had items such as Salad with various dressings Taquitos Beef fajitas Chile Verde Ceviche Guacamole Pozole or menudo (can't remember which) Fruit Sweet bread Whipped cream Bacon Potato hash And a few other items  First nothing was fresh and second nothing was hot. Most things were warm-ish like the taquitos. Who wants a cold taquito? The beef fajitas were swimming in oil..The Chile Verde was decent it wasnt hot but it was warm enough to at least taste ok. I mostly filled up on the chips and salsa they bring to your table when u first sit down. They come with a mild salsa and bean dip which is pretty tasty and I got a big bowl of guacamole from the buffet to dip the chips into as well. I also had some Mexican sweet bread with some whip cream and it was probably the best thing I ate. I did order a mimosa which was standard nothing special buy it was nice that it was included.  The only other thing to mention was the little glass room right in the middle of the restaurant thats attached to the kitchen....an older lady was in there making homemade tortillas and it was pretty cool to watch. At least we know something is fresh there!",

    "text": "This place is way far away but to meet some quality people I made the drive! I love mexican food, I've been to quite a few parties where the families have cooked and its some amazing food.  So I come to this place and after the rave reviews expected a lot.   The atmosphere is quaint and nice, and the service is spectacular.  It also probably helped they weren't that busy.  The chips and salsa were good, not overly salty and as usual addictive.  I ordered the tacos, they only had hard shells and the shell was overly greasy and fell apart immediately.  i ended up eating it like an open faced sandwich.  My friends got burritos and meat dishes and they looked pretty good, and i usually love fajitas so maybe I'll give it a second chance should I be up that way again.   I did like that now they have outdoor seating and there is a lot of other nice places nearby.",

Chicken fajita for two was filled with chicken pieces that looked like they were scraped from a slaughter room floor. The seasoning made the chicken orange, and several pieces were nothing but connective tissue. Onions were not on the serving plate -- well there was one small piece of onion.   Flan for desert, was an insult to flan everywhere and was soaked in something like pancake syrup.   All in all, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE. Never again!",

The drinks are pretty weak, but they taste good and are bottomless...so how can I complain?  :P  Service is pretty fast and friendly too.  We were here for 3hrs and never felt rushed.

By now the wait staff know us by name and treat us like old friends. I'm sure the level of service we receive is observed behavior from Mark, the owner who is often wondering the restaurant, striking up friendly conversation with customers. I am happy to say the great habits of the owner, Mark, have rubbed off well to the hired staff. I can honestly say, even on days we dine there and Mark is not there, the waiters, waitresses, services, bartenders all have treated us very well. As far as the food, I have not had a bad meal. The menu is very large and there is a large selection. I personally recommend the seafood selections but if your unsure, I have always received great recommendations from the waiters.",

They were extremely dry , so sour cream and guac should be in this buffet for 16 bucks. They should also serve you fresh tortillas because they were very hard out of the metal basket. The beef fajitas I had were very dry and tasteless. The desserts are store bought cheap brownies and generic cookies. I have come here many times for dinner, but this buffet could be so much better if they just added a few things and made slight changes.  I hate waking out of here paying 20 bucks for a dissatisfied meal. The employees are amazing, and I know the management cares about customers complaints. Man, it hurts to write this review , but I have to be honest. Go for the fresh food in the kitchen , stay away from the bland dry food at the buffet. Urghhh... I was so looking forward to this",

My husband and I were waited on by Luis, who was overall fantastic, witty, and very knowledgeable about the cuisine. We arrived around 2 on Saturday and we were able to take advantage of happy hour prices for drinks (yes even on a Saturday)! I wanted to try something different than my normal chimichanga,tamale,burrito mainstays, and Luis suggested the Build Your Own entree. With his guidance I ordered the New York Strip steak, with the cognac cream sauce and fresh flour tortillas. It was fantastic and will now be one of my regular dishes to order! The steak was thin but very flavorful and tender. I was definitely pleased!",

    "text": "Searching for good mexican food is Vegas is not easy.  Every place, even the ones that use the word \"authentic\" are just americanized eateries that have the usual mexican dishes.  Lindo Michoacan is no different.  I agree with most of the posts.  The salsa is plain and way too much tomato sauce and no tomatoes, onions or cilantro.  The beans served with the salsa was as you would expect.  The best part was our shrimp dish.  The shrimp tasted like- SHRIMP.  We found that amazing.  Our server was great.  The house margaritas seemed watered down and we had a pitchers worth of them.  This is probably more a personal thing but I found a spelling error in the dessert menu, they used the word CARMEL meaning CARAMEL.  I pointed it out to our server and then tried to reach the overall manager for the chain, Gerardo at the number listed on the website.  He was too busy to take my call so I wrote to them via the supplied email address.  Three days later no email or call.  This indicates a real lack of concern and a lack of customer service that I expect where ever I eat. I would think they would be very appreciative of someone who spotted this mistake so they could correct it.  Now that I see how they ignored me, I am doubting they care or will ever correct it.  Overall the food was average to good.  The service was great, the atmosphere was typical mexican restaurant.  I really wish they would improve the salsa and margaritas and learn how to spell.",

The margaritas may been a bit weaker than you're used to, but they're bottomless!  Service has been great, as the groups I've been with have been known to stay for three hours or longer, and the staff never gives us a hard time.

We arrived at 530, one of the people had to make a 1000 flight, he actually was unable to eat because our food took way way too long, well over an hour after we ordered!  My son actually went to the kitchen looking for it, at which time they brought it out, all steaks, ordered medium.rare, were cooked thru!  I have brought people here for years and never experienced being ignored, bad food and having to remind our waiter to bring drinks.  The servers, all of who incall by name after knowing them years came with all our food at the same time, Luke warm.  Sadly, I will not return.  I tossed my rewards card.",

I ordered a 12oz chicken breast with cognac sauce and  my husband ordered the orange roughy.   My chicken was sooooo over cooked I couldn't even cut it. Beans were dried out and crusted over.  Rice was crunchy. So either they had it done and kept it under the light so it over cooked or the chef really doesn't know when to take food off the grill.  The fish was filled with bones.  I actually left the bones in the bill holder to show them.  I have eaten there before many times and it has never been amazing but it was fine.  Last night was terrible it has made it so I will not go back. The owner knew and something was up.  He kept coming around apologizing to people.  Would have rather gone to Taco Bell.",

We sat there for 45 min just waiting for our food so ofcourse we are eating tons of chips, everytime I had to ask for more the bus boy looked pissed and didn't really bring many. Mind you I'm 8 months pregnant so I can definitely eat!! I didn't appreciate the irritated looks he gave to me when I kindly asked for more. My daughter tried some of my habenero salsa and desperately needed water. He came by 3 times and each time she asked for water he never brought it. I'm so overly disappointed in the service. My daughters enchiladas were cold and tasteless, (server never bothered to ask how our food was at all) my husbands Chile relleno was microwaved and soggy. My food was fine but I'm not picky I'm pregnant and starving all the time! Haha. We never got asked how our food was once, I felt so bad for my husband especially since they were still hungry. We left highly disappointed. I don't think we will ever be back.",

Food take too long of wait and when it arrives there is missing silverware, food was bland and its overall experience is a 3.  I ordered enchiladas dinner plate.

It used to be our favorite place to have family dinners and drinks but not anymore. Something changed and it's not great anymore. We will not be coming back to this place. Yesterday was the last time.  As for the restroom. It was filthy and it appeared it was dirty for a long time. Just dirt and the smell in the Ladies room was horrible.  I give the restroom a 1 for nastiness. What happen to the management of of this place?",

Which was a surprise being owners are never there at their place and businesses suffer because of that. Anyways, it was nice and chips & salsa were given to us. The chips were crunchy and fresh. They were not greasy or flimsy, like chips sometimes can be. The salsa was not too spicy but had really good flavor. We talked and ordered some street tacos some lengua, Al Pastor, and Asada. The lengua was melt in your mouth as well as the others. Cesar was our waiter and he was punctual he never let our drinks go dry or and brought our food out promptly. The drinks were delicious and fresh. We shared a pitcher of Frank Margarita and had the best tequila we have ever tasted it was called Casa Nobel it was in a black bottle $25 a shot but you  only live once. I will be coming back here for the food, the people, and the drinks. Very great experience!",

Ordered a shredded carnitas burrito and it was big and filling but they left huge chunks of pork not cool, so had to leave it to the side to eat later. Then I ordered flautas with cabbage (they had no shredded cabbage) so they gave me shredded lettuce instead. The price point is a bit steep for what you get compared to other places. Overall, it's ok that's why I gave them 3 stars!",

Salsa and bean dip were tasty. We ordered: bowl of tortilla soup (very good), chipotle caesar salad with grilled shrimp (didn't taste anything caesar or chipotle about it, the shrimp were medium size & although plentiful, they were overcooked and not cleaned well which totally killed it for me), veggie aguacate tacos with rice & beans (only ate one taco & it was good with some help from the salsa). Happy hour was on so we ordered some bottled blue moon and bud light at $2.50 & $3.00 a bottle. Food took over 30 minutes to be served & I've had much better Mexican food for less money and will not be back here.",

Both unbelievably amazing! We've been going here for years and have never been disappointed. From the food, service and atmosphere...it is by far the best Mexican restaurant in town.",

I requested a booth for a party of 2 and there was clearly at least one available booth right next to the hostess stand and she flat out refused to seat me there. Her claim, that booths were reserved for larger parties.   1. I saw booths only occuppied by two people.   2. There were zero parties waiting for a table.  When a restaurant does not appreciate your choice to spend your dollars there given an entire city of options, that in itself is clear to me that they don't ever care if I return again. So there you have it - I will never again return to this restaurant to spend my dollars when there is simply no regard for or appreciation of it. You can remind your hostess that we, as customers, are in fact the ones who keep her employed by spending our money there.  Remember that.",

Parking was easy, the interior and the culture of the inside is so beautiful, staff and faculty are quite accommodating, but the prices for the quality of food was not up to par. Because of the buffet special our wee party of three opted for the Sunday Brunch Buffet for $15.95 per adult.  Quality of food was not as warm as we'd hoped, the flour tortillas were burned, and a lot of the food served was pretty dry. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of low quality food, therefore the low quality rating.",

The staff really makes this place above average! The outdoor patio is awesome!  The first time I was here was during the day, and I have to say oddly enough the food was actually much better. Maybe the day chef is more experienced? Or it was slower? Not sure, but we were all in agreement that.  The second time we went was for dinner, and it was busy! The food was still great, but not as perfect as the first time. Everyones dinner was a bit off. Meat cooked a tiny bit too long, some things hot, others only warm. And the $14 drinks was a bit of a shocker! Over all we had a great time.  Taking into account the pros and cons, I would go back.",

I almost turned around and went home because I couldn't find a parking spot..then in the very far last row waaaaayyyyy far away opens up a spot. No big deal, it's a special event.. The restaurant is sort of small, but there's also outdoor seating on the side. Check out the window into the kitchen for a peek at tortillas in the making, it's a cool feature.. For the special event there were a bunch of tables set up outside in front of the restaurant with a stage for a mariachi band and a raffle. The tent outside had very limited drink selections - beer and plain margaritas.  I opted to go inside and hit up the full service bar. There was a gal bartender that made an amazing raspberry margarita. $17 for a small margarita and a shot of Don Julio... Back outside, we started getting hungry.. Unfortunately there was no food service outside. I appreciate the whole setup, but you shouldn't have a courtyard full of drinking patrons and not allow some kind of snacks..at least some chips and salsa!  I prefer the Lindo in Summerlin South.. It's larger and seems a tad nicer.",

My husband loves their seafood soup.  I usually stick with my Mexican food standby of enchiladas.  Am giving them a 4 because Their enchilada sauce (red sauce) could use some more spunk.  It's not super flavorful.  We love the cups of Fideo soup they give with each meal.  It's such a simple soup, but we think it's nutritious.  The chips, salsa & bean dip is good.  We also like how the place is decorated.",

This is the kind of restaurant that makes me realize the importance of cooking at home. The only authentic Mexican print of this place is the music. Save yourself $60 and go elsewhere!!!",

If you're craving mexican food then this place will definitely satisfy you.  The authenticity is close, but of course,  not quite there.  The tortillas are handmade however and delicious. The only downsides,  in my opinion,  are the small wait area and the waiter never refilling my water,  which is a must when you have spicy salsa on the table.  Other than that, I left the establishment with a smile.  We will definitely be back.",

The food there is absolutely superb!!!  The service is awesome (Josua, Javier, Luis, & Omar, just to name a few)!!!  The owners - Mark and Kyle regularly check if we are satisfied and happy with our meals and service.  We have brought numerous friends and relatives to this Centennial Center gem.  Everybody has always agreed with us that this is the best Mexican, hands down.  None of our dinner guests has ever been unhappy with what they ordered.  They also have the best Margaritas (thanks to Jose at the bar). The bacon wrapped shrimp are to die for. The table side guacamole is a must. Last year, I had my retirement party here with over 30 people.  The owners and the workers bent over backwards to make sure that I and my friends had a very good time.

    "text": "So this is the second time we have been to Michoacan in the last month and probably the 40th time over the last year.  We came in on Cinco de Mayo and it was just awful.  The salsa was watered down, Fideo soup had no noodles, and the fajitas were dry and lacked any flavor.  Additionally, we had a conversation going on between three people that verged on xrated and spoke of their sex life so that four tables away we could hear them with no issue, and I am no prude.  If I would have had my children I would have left the restaurant and never returned.  Our waiter Efren appeared to have no issue and proceeded to give lackluster service.  Fast forward 20 days to today and we again have the same waiter and we again are disappointed by the food and waiter.  We ordered two burritos and a combo and received no soup and my chile relleno was raw and not cooked.  It is with great sadness that i write this as we have come here for years.  I fortunately refer you now yo our alternate mexican restaurant Viva Mercado in Village Square or any if the numerous Cafe Rio Locations, which to this point have not altered the quality of their food.  I may not come back, I will not come back for Cinco, and i definitely will not refer anyone at this point as it is just disappointing. Quality Quality Quality.  The one positive in all of this was the kick ass work ethic by Phibbs bussing the tables.  Sorry Michoacan but now you are just one of the 100's of mediocre Mexican restaurants.  James Miller",

I prefer the dinner plates where you choose the protein and then the sauce. There's about 5 sauces that I prefer and they never let me down. The staff are very good at matching the flavors between proteins and sauce. If I can't make up my mind,  then I go for the fajitas. Those are the best I've had in town.",

    "text": "Not bad!!!  I had tried this place years ago when we had a Vegan Eatz/V Animal Sanctuary dinner and.......I was not impressed.  Hubs and I were craving refried beans, some table side guac...the works.  The table side guac was yummy, I kinda wish I would have asked for more cilantro and some jalapenos (we were afraid it would be too spicy. But know we know.  Just speak up and ask for it exactly the way you want it.  Hubs got the vegan burritos they had grilled and sauteed veggies, beans with optional red sauce on top. It came with a side of refried beans. I tried it and it was very yum.  I wanted to FINALLY try a tamale. I'm not sure if I have really ever eaten a tamale? I'm not a fan of ground mushy maize. (It tastes like a wet dog smells to me for some reason.)  Well, this didn't. And it was vegan. It was full of mushrooms and garlic. You can choose either red or green sauce to go on top. It was yum. And big! One was filling to me. I got a side \"salad\" of tomatoes lettuce and onion with cilantro vinaigrette and it was too much food for me.  I really like their bean dip, salsa and chips! I can really put a hurtin' on them.  Keep in mind this is NOT health food and probably contains more oil than one should eat in a year total, but it's good Americanize Mex!!!!!",

The food, and the people that work there give a Great atmosphere to a very good dining experience. I was so pleased with how all the employees work together to make sure that not only weren't my dad and I left wanting, but from what I observed, neither were our fellow diners. Even though neither my dad and I ordered anything from the bar, I could see that a good number of people were enjoying themselves at the bar while enjoying the Golden Knights power on against Washington. If you want to enjoy a good meal and get stuffed--the portions are so much-- with or without drinks, my opinion, you will be greatly pleased with your outing at MICHOACAN...",

The hostess who took the order forgot to put it in the system until I arrived (30 minutes after I called to place the order to begin with). They said it would take 15 to 20 minutes to complete it. Because of the small space it was very congested and the manager wasn't helpful in the least, simply telling me he was sorry but there was nothing more he could do (what about a discount?). When we arrived home they forgot several items, gave us one wrong dish, and put them together poorly. On top of it all the food was incredibly mediocre. On the Border is a similar Mexican restaurant half a mile away. Save yourself the trouble and go there.",

After sitting unattend for the first 6 minutes a server brought us chips, salsa, and their bean dip; he left before we could ask for drinks. Five minutes later someone came and took our drink order. About 20 minute in we got our drinks and ordered. They brought my steak without a steak knife and forgot my tortillas, but I didn't notice till the waiter stepped away. Since they were no were to be seen, I mushed through it with a butter knife.  Later in the meal they did refill our waters a few times.  As we were finishing up, they were very quick to clear away our plates.  Overall, the food is far from special.  The service was slow and unattentive.

Which was great because we had my 3 year old and it was nice and secluded so we didn't have to worry if he was a little antsy since he missed his nap. The menu had a great variety. I was excited when I saw Squirt listed under the sodas. Ordered it. They did not have it. Decided to try a blueberry daiquiri since I saw it on the menu. The waiter came back to inform me they did not have it. For dinner ordered the skirt steak. Which is always one of my favorite cuts off meat in Mexican cuisine. Once AGAIN, the waiter came back and informed me they did not have it. I went with the NY strip instead, which was more expensive. My entire family was served their meal EXCEPT ME! Once I informed the waiter (food runners brought the meal out to my family ), it took almost 10 more minutes to get my food. What I did receive was delicious. But nothing was done or offered for the delay or that everything I ordered they were out of. Not even an offer to buy my dessert, as most places would. Our waiter was very sweet, but I feel the costumer service was lacking because of that. I think the extra kick in the pants is that my family wanted to go to another Mexican restaurant that evening, but I persuaded them to dine here and my experience was not that wonderful.",

We go almost every week now and at the time of this review I seem to be \"The Duke\" of this location here on YELP because I check in every time we dine.  This place is really worth it all around. It is individually owned these days and the quality of everything is superb. Family friendly and always packed on Friday and Saturday nights at dinnertime. Call ahead and they will put your name on the wait list. You can also reserve a table on their web site.  The owner told me the entire interior design and all the items were hand selected from Mexico by himself and brought to the restaurant. It's a great atmosphere and the staff is friendly, quick, and knows how to serve hungry customers.  THE FOOD:  When you are seated you get chips, salsa, and bean dip. Always great!  All of their sauces are made by hand fresh daily. I think they have 7 of them.  We have tried, and LOVE the following dishes:  - Chicken Fajitas  - Carnitas (they serve them with a rib!)  - Chicken Enchiladas (with the green sauce) This one is my favorite. The flavors are delicate, the chicken is shredded and tasty and it has me hooked. I normally ask for a side of shredded lettuce and cheese instead of the usual rice and beans. It's just my preference.  They also have a awesome dessert that consists of a huge ball of fried ice cream surrounded by caramel sauce and sliced plantains (think bananas) that is lit on fire and served to you flaming! Soo good!  I have heard their Sunday Buffet Brunch is pretty awesome, but I normally go on Saturday nights for the LIVE mariachi band so I miss going on Sunday.  I signed up for their loyalty card the second time we went back. They put 5% of the total of your bill each time you dine on a gift card that you can just save up and use towards any meal. How awesome is that? I think I have close to $30 right now saved on it.  The price of the food is very fair for the quality you get. Portion size is more than enough. All in all I can't say anything negative about this place... and no, I wasn't paid to write this. HAHA.",

Here's a tip.....if you want to come here on a holiday and you don't mind eating lunch early, stop by between 9:30-10:30 am.....it's open and there's no wait to get in.  If you come after 11 am, it will be jam packed.  I ordered the Nachos & Mom ordered the Playa Combo....which is a Chile Relleno & Chicken Taco.  The food came out quickly and of course everything was fresh and delicious.  I love how they have complimentary unlimited Chips & Salsa w/Beans.  The Salsa is spicy, just right and the Chips are homemade.  This place never disappoints!  Happy Father's Day to all the Dad's out there!  Voy a volver? Por supuesto!  (Will I return?  Of course!)",

The only issue we have had is the portions are very large. We ordered Ala carte this time which was perfect. We got the two fideo soups, a taco, an enchilada, and guacamole.  With the chips and salsa along with two margaritas we were totally satisfied.   The food, service, and atmosphere make this one of our favorite Resturant's in Las Vegas.",

The salsa is tasty and if you request it they will bake and not fry your chips. I usually call ahead if I know I am going to be there and they get them started for me. This last visit the place was packed. They have live music that is cool. It is clean inside. I think if you are in the area you should give it a try! There us currently a weekend lunch buffet that is a great deal.  I like that it is near the super wal-mart because since most of my paycheck goes to wally world I can at least stop by Lindo on the way and have lunch or dinner :)",

I got the vegetarian enchiladas which came with the entree, tortilla chips, beans and rice, little corn flour tortilas, fideo soup, and what was either a spicy sauce or salsa (not too experienced with Mexican food, so I couldn't tell if they forgot to give me salsa or if that was it).    The fideo soup was really good, kind of like a Mexican version of ramen noodles (I mean the real Asian kind, not the stuff college students eat).  I thought the amount of food was good for the price I paid.  I filled up so much on the rice and bean tortillas that I didn't finish the entree in one sitting.   The only complaint I have was the veggies in the veggie enchilada could have been more diverse.  It was mostly carrots and squash.  I would have liked to see some more cheese in it also.    They didn't wow me, but I would come back when I'm in the mood for Mexican.",

Me and the wife usually both eat for around $40, tip included. The Don Fransisco is my favorite dish, it's a nice size piece of carne asada smothered in melted queso, chiles, and cebollas...YUM! Also the atmosphere is awesome with live marriachi/rancheras music! The service is also top notch, and the waiters are very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu! And as any person who knows comida Mexicana will tell you...try the salsa and the frijoles first...if they are good, then so will the food be. And they are both AWESOME here! 5 STARS all the way!

A large party next to me barely ate 1/2 their food and they were all (happily) complaining about how full they were. They all left with to-go boxes. I had the Huachinango (whole fried snapper) with the garlic butter sauce on top. The fish was tasty with flaky flesh and crispy skin. The garlic butter sauce offered good flavor, but was primarily HUGE chunks of garlic. So large, I initially they were diced onions on top. Would've preferred a more blended sauce that would stick to the fish better. I like garlic...a lot. But that could be off-putting to some (see my pics of the fish). Finished the meal off with Churros **thanks Yelp check-in** You can't go wrong with a churro. It's drizzled with a caramel sauce and has whipped cream on the side. NO COMPLAINTS! All in all, a decent Mexican spot. Exactly what you'd expect, and I doubt anyone would be too disappointed with their food choices.  I would come here again: 1) I saw 1800 Tequilla Anejo behind the bar and I never find that at restaurants **my fave** 2) I'd like to try the Sunday Brunch Buffet",

I've been a couple of times and the food was good, but other times it's seemed as if they didn't season the food enough. Although, I will say the beans have been bland at best every time. It's unfortunate it's just not one of their strong suits.   The tamales were good one visit and just average the next, I don't know maybe they have a different cook like one named Roberto who is amazing and when he's in the kitchen the food is good, but when Fred is in the kitchen just accept the fact you're getting bland, sloppy, uneventful food.   Overall, I'm disappointed because I think Mexican food is my favorite genre and they're not living up to their full potential due to inconsistencies.",

Like others have mentioned, the decor is amazing. I came with my girlfriend and upon being seated, I immediately noticed that this place looked very clean and was well embellished.    It's quite small, but still a nice little antiquated Mexican restaurant.   As soon as we were seated we were given chips with salsa and bean dip. The salsa, like many people have stated, was subpar. Tasted like Campbell's tomato soup. However, the bean dip was excellent. For the main course I got the Dijon mustard grilled chicken, which was pretty average. My girlfriend got the combo that came with a chicken enchilada, beef taco, and a tostada, which were all pretty average, except for the enchilada which wasn't that good because the chicken was slightly lukewarm and the flavor was lacking. However, the True masterpiece of this place, is their tortillas. So soft and warm. They are the best tortillas I've ever had in my life! But I can't rate this place on the tortillas alone. So the overall score is 3 out of 5 stars. Because everything was pretty average.  P.S try the horchata, it's really good.",

The service was fantastic; Jen at the bar was so nice and she always gives top of the line service. The one thing that bothered me right down to the core was the manager on duty the night of 3/20. My boyfriend and I were definitely not the last people on the restaurant. Actually one gentleman and a couple walked in about 15 minutes after us. It was getting close to closing time and we were being mindful of the time because we would never want to keep a business open longer than needed but the manager was telling Jen to have us wrap it up and to have her leave early. We were gambling and the guy next to us JUST got his food; kind of a ridiculous request to me. This was about 40 minutes till close also. Then 10 minutes later he comes back and tells Jen to let us know last call. REALLY????? With 30 minutes, a couple still eating in the dining room bar area and a guy still eating at the bar you're going to say last call and rush us and your bartender out of the restaurant. I was completely offended by his actions. My boyfriend and I are late night eaters and if he's going to be the new manager at night we definitely won't be coming back.",

I'm giving a five star even though our last meal wasn't the greatest. We both had tacos, me shrimp and his was fish. His fish tacos were pretty good, probably could've used some more seasoning. And mine is where the problem was. My shrimp was totally cooked to death. They were so rubbery and over cooked. And I would've love some pick de Gallo with it and some kind of sauce other than mayo and ketchup. But we will still be coming back. The customer service is always awesome. Everyone is always so nice and always checking to make sure your drink is filled and if you want more chips and salsa/ beans. This is our place, where we get to go to without kids and have a meal just the two of us. And I'm sure if I said something they would've remade my meal. So thank you to the people that run and work here, best customer service.",

The tortillas is the best tortillas I have ever tried just because it's made fresh.   This time I ordered the chipotle lengua (cow tongue), I know it sounds nasty but hey it taste good. The lengua came with rice and bean's, guacamole. The rice was good, bean's not a bean fan so didn't get it, guacamole was good. For dessert I ordered churros, came with 4 small churros and whipped cream. When I first came here I ordered the steak rancheros, I would recommend trying it.   I would totally recommend this place to my friends and family and fellow yelpers. The service is great, food is great, and the place itself is nice and clean.",

For those who know this place it used to be called \"lindo michoacan\".Now it's just known for \"michoacan\". Well that right there should have said a lot to me. I gotta say that as soon as we walk in the place look dead, we had Jimmy take our order, I thought to myself we might not have to wait to long for our food , since the place was pretty empty. Well we almost waited 35 minutes just for our plates to come out. Jimmy and Javier kept bringing us drinks that we didn't even order, these two where the worst. And when we'd ask for extra napkins and refill for our drinks, they would just take their sweet ass time. The food we got was sooo bland, it had no taste for as long as they took to bring it out. I thought maybe it will at least taste great!!!! But guess what....it was horrible!!!!! Never coming back to this place. I would rather spend my money across the way at Red Robin. So here's the tip you two were expecting to get....provide better service next time, maybe then you two might get a tip!!!! And for you Javier next time someone asks you for a drink...don't look bother, it's your job!!!!",

And luckily it wasn't as bad.   Let me get rid of the bad... The food still suxx... I ordered a burrito, yes it was huge. They need to put on the description that it is shredded beef. Me no like shredded beef.   Now the good, the reason this gets 3 stars.   What this place has always had is excellent service, not gonna lie, probably the best anywhere. My gf's dad has a mean old temper and is impatient. Every time it looked like he was about to blow up, the waiter took charge and explained the situation, calmed him down and made it look easy.   This place seemed to accommodate my 2 year old very well! Best service for a 2 year old anywhere. Nice clean black high chair with cushion (Lexus of highchairs,) brought out a special sippy cup with coloring paper and crayons. AND she got her soup fast, so that she wouldn't get impatient while we ordered. Not too bad at all.   Lindo, sorry but your food still super sux.",

Margaritas made with sweet and sour instead of real lime juice, points deducted.   I had the skirt steak, my wife had the porterhouse covered in salsa verde.  Both were very good, although the porterhouse was overcooked a bit. My advice is to always order your steaks one level underdone when not in a real steakhouse.   The service was very friendly, attentive, and courteous throughout.   The food is good, but not REALLY GOOD. And certainly not great. I'm Hispanic, it's not that difficult to make tasty rice or beans, but Vegas strikes out once again.   This place is just a couple of blocks away, good food, but I'm good for another year.",

After waiting 40 minutes for our food my Mother received the incorrect dish. We had to ask multiple times to have our waiter come back and he picked up the dish, no apologies for the error. About 25 minutes later after the rest of us had finished our food my Mother did finally receive the correct dish but was sloppily put together. We asked for the Manager several times, which we later found out was the owner, Mark Berry. FInally after a bit the Owner came over and asked what was wrong without introducing himself. My Father asked if he was the Manager and he arrogantly said, \"I can be.\" We explained the situation and his response was, \"What do you want me to do about it?\" My Father told him to fix the problem and the Owners response was, \"You were unhappy the minute you walked in.\" We were mortified by the arrogance and condescending attitude from Mark Berry the Owner!  It ruined the lunch and we left. I went to Mark after my parents walked out and told him his behavior was unacceptable and he should not have spoken to my elderly parents that way especially on Mothers Day. Mark's response, \"Well I am only human, what do you want me to do?\"   Poor service, arrogant and unaccomodating Owner and marginal food. That is what you get at this restaurant. There are so many other wonderful Mexican restaurant choices in town that know how to treat a customer, avoid this place.",

Lindo was already hoppin' at 6:30, but we seemed to beat the crowd and only had a 10 minute wait for a table.  We were seated at a table in the bar area - between the bar stools and the massive booths they have.  (To be honest the booths look plush and wonderful, but are so large they seem out of scale with this rather small restaurant).  The service was warm and attentive throughout.  Complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip? Check.  All were good - the salsa even a bit hotter than what I expected, which made for an auspicious start!  House margaritas on the rocks with salt made with sweet and sour and Sauza were bright, tangy and not overly sweet - yummy.  Wow - their menu is extensive with all kinds of innovative, tasty sounding dishes like Fillet Relleno -  fish fillet stuffed with seafood and then breaded and fried.  I opted for the Enchiladas de Camaron - gulf shrimp in tortillas with red enchilada sauce.  The combination includes fideo soup - although it's just a simple tomato based soup with vermicelli noodles, I'm a big fan of any restaurant that serves it.  Love me some fideo and this one was good.  The entrees arrived and, after such an exciting stellar start, I was surprised they were a little...well...meh.  The shrimp were cooked nicely inside my enchiladas, but the sauce was kind of tasteless.  Rice and beans were fine, pretty much what you would expect to find in any mexican restaurant.  My whole entree was kind of a plate of bland.  That said, I definitely want to go back - I haven't lost faith, maybe I just didn't make the right choice off of their massive menu.  Mole anyone?",

    "text": "Pretty solid Mexican restaurant.  They offer the full assortment of menu offerings that we've come to expect from all of the Michoacan restaurants around town.  The food is good, but falls short of recipes at the other restaurants.  It's like there's just a little something missing, and the prices are anywhere from $2-6 higher per dish.    Be patient.  The facility is a fairly small and during dinner time there is often a wait to be seated.    The one area that they really conquer and rule the competition is their Sunday brunch.  None of the other Mexican joints can hang with their brunch.  It's a full buffet bar with freshly made dishes, soup, salad, and desserts.  Their tortilla soup is to die for; they offer fresh ingredients, that include ingredients such as avocado and creme fraiche to fix the soup up yourself.  Sunday brunch is $14, which includes the food and drinks.",

Staff was super friendly and helpful with menu suggestions, the live music was cheesy yet awesome, place was clean, service fast, food delicious!  The chips, bean dip and salsa hold you over until you get your food.  I ordered the three chicken tacos and it came with Fideo soup to start, Mexican rice and beans.  My wife ordered the Novillo Al Conac which was steak with a reduced mushroom sauce, Mexican rice, beans and tortilla.  She loved it!  For an appetizer we had some awesome Ceviche Camaron.  Not too wet, not to dry, plenty of shrimp and very tasty.  For dessert, we got the Lindo Flameado (fried ice cream surrounded by banana slices).  They set it on fire right in front of us. It smelled good and tasted even better!  Also the Dulce De Leche was ordered and it was fantastic!  My wife initially didn't want any but ended up eating half of it.   Nice place to have dinner on a night out.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

I like the salsa (although they could offer more types) and the bean dip. The chips are usually a little over done and need salt IMO.  I do like the fideo soup..it is a nice change.     The Margaritas are not impressive and I am sure I do better with one eye open missing an arm so that is a letdown as I crave good margaritas and will choose where I go alot of the time on them as sometimes I just want a drink and chips/salsa.   The service here is always amazing I will give them that but this is the only location I go to as I refuse to go the the GV location as it looks like a damn nightclub all the time it is so packed.  So final judgment is not an impressive place and another place that is over-hyped by people with no taste for what quality food should be",

The lighting was too bright. The chile relleno was soggy and swimming in tomato saucey water (whuuuut?). The burrito was huge but also swimming next to the relleno and a bit soggy (I felt guilty for having had an animal live and die just to go into that).   I don't know what the high reviewers see in this place...maybe other reviewers have assessed it rightly that they just don't know good quality food. Maybe the giant portion sizes impress them; for me, it's just more bad food. I actually prefer Taco Bell to this overpriced underwhelming \"gourmet\" restaurant. I was craving Leticia's but they were closed. Next time I'll just wait. This place has Leticia's prices but not even fast food quality.  Disappointing.",

Coming from Phoenix I had never seen Fideo served at a Mexican food restaurant so I knew this place was authentic! In Mexico my tia's use to make Fideo a few times a week.  It's a brothy noodle soup with a few simple ingredients that's so yummy!  Since I had company from out town, they always like to go eat Mexican and compare to restaurants back home.  I have been to this location a few times in the past and have always been a fan. I thought this would be the perfect place to stop by for lunch.  In the back of the restaurant, there's a viewing area to the kitchen where a giant comal is displayed so you can watch someone making homemade tortillas so this was a treat walking by as we were being seated.   Hostess was friendly and sat us at the table I picked-luckily I had that option. Being a control freak I always want the best seat in the house.  The soft guitar music playing provided some great ambiance. Lots of traditional decor including ceramics, paintings and carvings, it looked like you were in a little Mexican village. Our friendly waiter was dressed like a Mariachi!  Clever! I was ready to start requesting a song!  Immediately we were served this wonderful complimentary warm bean dip and salsa. The salsa tasted great with the perfect amount of spice and a bright beautiful red color.  A basket of crispy warm corn chips accompanied with just the right texture and thickness.  Nothing worse than a thin or thick chip.  I ordered off the A la Carte menu and chose the enchilada filled with shredded chicken and beef. The red chile sauce was very good.  The fluffy rice was cooked to perfection and beans were very tasty.  Service was speedy and we had friendly, all around great attentive service.  Plates start at about $10 and go up to $22 plus.  Lots of variety to choose from, overall a great place.  I can't wait to come back to try more dishes! Next time I'll try a churro for dessert and guess what Bobby Flay? Unlike Mesa Grill-they offer churros at lunch time! Bravo!",

We had a table in the very back of the restaurant and it was a smart move on their part as things got crazier the more mimosas we had... which was to be expected.  Free chips, refried beans and salsa.  The buffet includes shrimp ceviche, chicken taquitos, chile verde,  caldo de pollo, flour tortillas, Michoacan potatoes, bacon, sausage, beef fajitas, chicken fajitas, guacamole, jalapeno poppers, rice, beans, salad, fruits, cookies and pastries.  I made 2 trips to the buffet line (I would've made more trips if I didn't have a food poisoning episode the night before) and filled my plates with beef and chicken fajitas, sausage, taquitos, guac and jalapeno poppers.  Food was tasty!  We had the most profound conversations over champagne, mimosa, Midori, pina colada, etc.  The mimosas kept coming.  There was somebody celebrating their birthday at the next table.  So, the servers sang \"Happy Birthday\", put the sombrero on the person with the birthday and gave him a shot of tequila.  I've had 4 glasses of mimosa at this point and I may have uttered the word \"birthday\" because by my 5th mimosa, the servers came to our table, put a sombrero on my cabeza and started singing!  Jesus was playing the guitar and singing.  It was beautiful like church on Sunday.  But they didn't give me a shot of tequila, what gives? My birthday is not until August though.  We were there for a good 3.5-4 hours  and it was definitely $13+ well-spent! We'll be back for sure!",

    "text": "Went on Sunday 7-26-15 around 12:30 PM.  This restaurant is located next to Red Robin on Tropical & Centennial Center Blvd.   I have been to the location on Desert Inn & the one down in Henderson, and this one's no different.   It's an obligatory mexican restaurant.  Yes, there is crap hanging on the walls, yes they will sing to you on your birthday, yes they have margaritas.  I never liked guacamole until I had it at Lindo Michoacan.  It is phenominal.  They make it tableside. Yeah, it's $8.50 but it's soooo worth it.  I don't like avocados or cilantro but I love their guacamole.  It doesn't even make sense.   On this particular day I decided to try the combination plate #1 which is a chile relleno, chicken enchilada, and beef taco($16.95).  Too expensive and the chile relleno was sooo soggy and watery. It was like somebody fried a chile yesterday, warmed it up today, then dumped sauce on it and microwaved it again.  Yuck.  The beef taco and the enchilada were great.   The service is always crazy good.  Yesterday Luis was our server.  He couldn't have been better!!   One star for Luis, one star for the delicious guac, one star for cleanliness.",

Old:My family and I go here regularly.  The food is constantly good.  The service is always pretty good, with exceptions.  If you go here for dinner during peak hours, expect to wait.  There's a line, sometimes up to an hour.  There's a reason the line is there though, it's good food.   This is a slightly different style of Mexican of you're used Cali Mex, and it's nothing like Tex Mex (thank goodness, I'm not a fan of Tex Mex).  I've never had a problem with the taste or quality of the food.  Again, we go here regularly.  Worth the price.",

It was a chicken dish with a cream sauce and peppers. It was very good and had authentic spices. Hubby had the chilie Colorado and liked it a lot. Margaritas were very good and reasonably priced for non-happy hour pricing. Thank you Efren and Caesar. Great service!! The guacamole was great but I would have liked a little more ingredients in the salsa. It was a bit bland. Our son had already eaten but had the deep fried ice cream and loved it. Can't wait to try their brunch. We are transplanted from Southern Cal and wanted a great Mexican restaurant with a friendly staff. We found it!!",

I know the owners, did not see them around at all yesterday. YIKES, I know it's been a while since I been there but my wife and I went for lunch yesterday at 12:10 and it was the worst experience ever. Service was REALLY slow, had to ask multiple times for refills on drinks, chips and salsa/bean dip. Wife ordered her meal it came out room temp and siting in a pile of oil. I ordered fajitas I was served the lunch special fajitas (which I had not ordered) waiter failed to ask me which fajitas I wanted. I wanted the fajitas that came on a sizzling plate, not fajitas that were room temp and looked like yesterdays leftovers. Our meal took quite a while, heard other customers complain about the wait and telling the waiter they could not wait any-longer and asked for the meal to go. Waiter never asked if we wanted and desserts, which we were going to order until we were handed out check as the waiter hurried by. Hey Mark, I'm not sure what's going on at the restaurant but the staff was not pleasant, the service was very lacking, the food quality was less than what I have been accustomed to. I hope this was just a blip and not the new normal.",

    "text": "It has been a while since my last visit, so I am not sure if ownership changed or the cook or both, because food quality is not the same.   We came here in the past on several occasions for their Sunday Brunch and endless margaritas, and mimosas for the great price of $12.95.   However, we recently found out that their special brunch was only going to be served once a month from now on. So we made it a point to not miss this month.  I was  initially bummed that they would only have their brunch once a month but after today's experience, I'm okay if they have it once a year or never.  I mean if you are going to have a once a month brunch, make it count.  The selections were far less than I remembered, and I think they thought they could make up for it by adding 2 seafood dishes, but the seafood was completely overcooked and all the other dishes just seemed to lack flavor and authenticity.  The only dish that was decent enough for me today was their Carnitas a la Coca-Cola and for this dish alone I didn't leave hungry.  I know I always say that I won't torture myself with another makeshift Mexican Restaurant, but seriously, this place was pretty decent some time ago and I actually was looking forward to coming back here again... so disappointed and just glad we did not drag anyone else along for this experience.",

One of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to.  It was as high end as it gets for a Mexican restaurant without being stupid.  The handmade tortillas (which you see being produced in the window) are to die for.  The service was very helpful.  My go-to, enchiladas, were fantastic.  Take it from this Southern California Latino, Michoacan is a must-do.  If Michoacan want to come to Long Beach, I'd be happy to help!",

    "text": "Review for Sunday Brunch!  Not to be confused with Lindo Michoacan, this Michoacan is located next to Red Robin and across the street from Sushi Loca in the far North West.  Jade hosted a UYE for Sunday Brunch and this place was packed!  Sunday Brunch is from 10am-3pm.  What a deal!  It's buffet style, a short buffet but my favorite part is the all you can drink house margaritas and champaign mimosas!  I had three plates of fajitas and tons of guacamole since I love avocado but where I killed it was the margaritas!    The server we had was awesome, he was busy as hell so I had to flag down others to help feed me my alcohol.  And how we got a big party is beyond me but the live mariachi was awesome.  They even sang to a birthday girl in our party.    Flavored house margaritas usually run for $5.00 each and the food combined would have cost a lot more than the $14 Sunday Brunch cost.  So this was a killer deal, the foods tasted authentic meaning it doesn't have that added fake flare to it, the tortilla machine was spinning and they were coming out fresh to the buffet line.    $14 Sunday Brunch for all you can drink (and eat too I guess) is not bad at alllll.",

It was not bad food at all, it was just really average. The food was comprable to any taqueria but for much more money.  The resteraunt was clean with some cool knick nacks on the wall and they had the had the game on but the table was super wobbly which kind of annoyed me.

Upon seating we were served a big bowl of house made tortilla chips with the Lindo house salsa and bean dip.  Hey, great beginnings!  Chips were still warm, I don't normally like smooth salsa (I like em' chunky LOL) but the flavor was good in Lindo's.  But that bean dip though!  Very tasty!  We were happy to eat all of this up!  No appetizer needed!  Actually, we weren't hungry enough to order entrees for each of us - so we did end up ordering appetizers to share!  **Nachos Monarca's - Corn tortilla chips with beans, melted cheese, jalapenos, and carne asada, topped with guacamole & sour cream  **Elotes - Mexican street corn grilled with mayo, cotija cheese, and lime chile powder  Both great choices overall!  The nachos were covered in tender carne asada, and thankfully it's real shredded cheese over EVERY chip!  Not into that cheese whiz stuff on nachos.  The platter was big too!  More than enough for 2 to share.  The elote was good too but was a little light on the lime chile powder.  Gimme sour!  Gimme spicy!  Gimme gimme gimme!  Luckily the extra limes on the side provided an extra kick.  Next time I'm gonna tell them heavy on the chile powder!  I probably ate more carbs than I should have that night - wonder if I was able to stay on KETO?  Service was speedy & friendly - the place was packed on a Friday night.  We'll visit Lindo again, maybe next time for their famous Fajita platters!",

Now for the last 6 or 8 months t this place is just not the same.  The food is just horrible.  So we went today,  my husband had chila quiles and it was just so soggy.  He ordered steak with it. Asked for medium and it was more like well done.  I always order the pozolle. It was always my go to.  Sadly this was even not what it use to be.  It was completely bland.  No flavor to it at all.  My daughter ordered enchiladas and even that was dissatisfying. They literally just threw a tortilla over chicken and poured sauce over it.  She said it was the driest enchiladas she's had.  The friends were wth said they most have changed owners or something. Even they noticed the difference in quality and taste.  The service was ok.  Not as good ad it use to be.  Took our waiter about 10 minutes just to come over to get our drink order.  Other then that they were friendly like always.  I don't think we will be going back anytime soon.  It was just a waste of money today.",

    "text": "Yea, No!  I chose this place because I thought it was a Lindo Michoacan and because they might have some good chilaquiles. When you first walk in they have the whole \"mexican\" vibe going, the hostess has on the long hispanic looking skirt and a smile on her face. When our waiter finally took our drink order down it took him a really long time to come back and take our food order. I got the red chilaquiles and my bf got the green ones. When the food finally came we got 2 plates with red chilaquiles on them. We told the waiter that they were red and he just seemed to not care, so I politely told him to take it back and to check the order, never even received a \"sorry\" or even a \"my bad\". They came back out with the right plate and the chilaquiles had more onion than anything else.  Overall the service was extremely slow, the food wasn't good, and the experience was just not the greatest. Safe to say that I will not be coming here again.",

I ordered their Pipian with chicken and it had a very good authentic taste.   I love that they have options of the amount of protein you can order (6oz-8oz of chicken, as an example). I'm a big meat eater and I count macros so having a high protein meal is important to me and I can always make their food fit my macros!   Cesar was a great server. He came around when needed and didn't hover.   We had churros filled with caramel and topped with whipped cream and it was the perfect amount of sweet to end the night!!",

I asked for a few changes to be made and the server continued to talk over me but after repeating myself, he would say okay and nod as though he understood. When i received my food, the few changes i asked for were dismissed and i was given the meal with everything, despite my food intolerance needs. When asked for corrections, he smirked and was very rude. He came back multiple times asking about each item in the entree and wondering if it was \"safe\". Almost sarcastically even though i needed only one item omitted. The server was just negligent and honestly seems burnt out from his job.   Strongly would not recommend this place to anyone because you'll leave disappointed and upset at the fact you went to this establishment to be with friend and family and to enjoy a great meal that you are paying for and leave feeling disrespected and unwelcome.",

We came here for an event and booked out the whole patio area. For all the people in our group, the service was great! All the servers were more than happy to help, which is actually surprising given that there were so many of us. We didn't have an empty glass for too long, if we had one at all!

With that party being in there, they completely forgot about our big group sitting in there as well. We had to wait almost 20 minutes for a server to come ask us what we wanted to drink. Then we didn't see him again for another long chunk of time. Someone else brought us some chips and salsa awhile later, but still no drinks. We had to constantly flag someone down to get anything, whether it was our server or not. We sat and waited and waited. We finally got our drinks after all of chips and salsa were gone. Then he took our orders. We asked for more chips but I guess he forgot about us again. Another 20-30 minutes went by and our food finally came out. At that time, we had to ask again for more chips since they never brought more out and refills on all of our drinks. Took forever to get our drinks refilled too. At that point, we were ready to just finish eating and leave.  The food was ok, but the quality has definitely gone down. I miss the way the food was awhile back when we used to come here. The service alone, would make us rethink coming here, the next time we want some mexican food. Sounds like the service is a lot better in the bar area. Maybe we can come during happy hour one day to see if it's any better and they don't forget about us again.",

We were heading back to AZ and located this restaurant through Google.  So happy we did!!!! It was a Sunday and they had the buffet opt in which I'm generally not a fan of HOWEVER in this case not only did the good smell fantastic but looked amazing, fresh and was warm! Menudo was spectacular!  Lalo and the otherJose were really friendly. They were checking in with all the tables assuring everything was good.   This place has been in biz over 10yrs and I see why! Service is extraordinary with top notch food and choices!  My daughter orders a tamale anytime we eat at a Mexican restaurant,  we call her the tamale critic. She said \" THIS TAMALE IS THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD\" she's not easy to please being a teen- HUGE compliment .  Definitely will be our place everytime we're in Las Vegas! Thx guys your team is doing a wonderful job! Special shout out to Jose the bartender- your a complete asset to Michoacan",

Two of us; had large fideo soup $11 with tortillas $2.25, and create your fav pork carnitas w/ Rajas Y Crema $14.    Comp chips, salsa, refried beans were more than enough, and tasty.  We were very happy with all of the food.  The Rajas was just right for a mild sauce.  Both large soup & 8oz pork was enough to take home leftovers.  One thing I love about this place is option to sub fresh veggies for rice/beans.  Is a great mixture of green/yellow squash, carrots, shrooms, & onions.  Service was top notch for the level of restaurant this is.  All of the 4 staff we encountered was pleasant and efficient.",

As regulars who normally only go to the bar for the best service from jose, we decided to dine in today and received very poor service from the lunch staff.  Greeted immediately at our table, our server promptly took our drink order of two waters with lemon, and 5 minutes later returned asking what we had ordered.  it went down hill from here. I should have known it would be my only one. None of the five workers ever stopped to refill my glass.... and our waiter? No where in sight for the next 15 minutes.   Luckily we are patient and understanding people, but upon a trip to the bathroom noticed it wasn't even busy....we quickly regretted what we thought would be an \"in and out experience.\" My boyfriend was craving ceviche as we were out running errands and starving.. I normally don't have a strong enough stomach for the food so I happily obliged to be his ceviche wingman. Luckily I had a bowl of chips and salsa to hold me over, however I wanted some limes to brighten the flavor and every time an employee walked by, we stopped them and asked for limes. NOT ONE person brought them... UNITL OUR MEAL WAS nearly OVER. (40 minutes and no one could complete the task of grabbing us some limes?)    When the ceviche did arrive it definitely hit the spot! food was good as it usually is, and when we finished asked for the check. Again From 4 different people. Our original server? He was no where to be found. We were now realizing that we clearly were not being treated with quality service and even overheard the Table behind us equally becoming impatient pleading for anyone walking by to take their order.   Today's experience made us rethink coming back to one of our favorite spots. If it weren't for our favorite bartender, we probably wouldn't come back as we felt Thirsty, hungry and neglected.",

    "text": "Service was excellent. They kept checking on us to make sure our drinks were never empty and to make sure the bean dip and chips were replenished. With that being said, I wish I could say the same for the food and comfort. I'm not sure why there are sooo many great reviews on the food here. Maybe I am spoiled from being raised in a Hispanic family and having authentic food? but then again, they are supposed to have \"authentic\" food. My 5 yr old wanted a chicken taco. She loves chicken. I saw her taking the chicken out, and I asked her what was wrong? she said she does not like it. Seeing that this little girl is a meat lover, we found that odd, so my wife tried the chicken and spit it out. She even showed me how it looked. It looked old and like it was microwaved. It was terrible and tasted like poultry without seasoning. My wife and I had the Carne Asada Torta, it was edible but it was nothing to make us return. The steak could have had more flavor The fideo soup had NO flavor at all. None of us finished it. The bean dip was just okay. The rice, I will admit was good. It was the best thing we had there.  Seating is very uncomfortable for a family of 5. They sat is in an area next to the door. There was a wall but it had a decorative window opening in which all the cold air kept coming in, every time the door was opened it did not close because it would get stuck. Our food was freezing cold in a matter of minutes and my kids had to eat with their coat on. ( it is December). Needless to say, we will NOT be returning to Michoacan. We will stick to Leticias.",

We chose Lindo Michoacan because it has won Best of Vegas for Mexican food for many years in a row. I have a hard time believing this is the best Vegas has to offer. The food was very average. The house-made tortillas were good, the specialties mostly bland, the margaritas were made with Sweet and Sour and were very generic. Their house salsa served with chips is very poor. Our server was very courteous and efficient, but there was little for him to do, since we were mostly serving ourselves.",

I love that they have a free rewards card where you can earn points towards free appetizers, desserts, and 50% off your bill. What's nice is you can earn double points Monday-Thursdays 2pm-5pm. They have an awesome lunch special menu. Starting as low as $8.50. Which includes your beverage and of course unlimited chips and salsa. My two favorites dishes are the Chicken taco salad and steak ranchero. They make the tortillas fresh as well. A+ in my books!",

    "text": "I had a date at Lindo Michoacan on NYE, even against the warnings of some friends who said the Centennial location isn't as good as the other Michoacan restaurants in town. The way I looked at it, if the date was going well, we probably wouldn't be paying much attention to our meals anyway! We were tended to in a very friendly manner, the entire time. I was senorita'd a handful of times which always makes me giggle on the inside. I'm not a burrito kinda girl but my date's grande burrito looked delicious! &, well, grande. I made sure to be as generic as possible & got the chicken enchiladas combo plate. The rice had alot of potential but it was crunchy, I had a couple bites of the beans which were good, the enchiladas could've been saucier but the chicken was seriously so darn juicy & flavorful, I ended up picking thru most of the tortilla & going straight for the pollo! I so wished I could've eaten the 2nd enchilada. But!, here's what really impressed me... Knowing it was NYE, I called earlier in the day to check how late they'd be open (I saw alot of places were closing at 8 & 9) & was told they'd be closing at 10. My date & I are talking & talking & talking & it hits me that the place is QUIET. We look around & see we are literally the only people left so I check the time... it was 10:40! We thought it was awfully kind that not a single person did so much as hover to indicate it was time to get the hell out... 40 minutes ago! That sort of thing goes a long way for me. Overall, I'd definitely go back (not overstaying my welcome!) & recommend to others.",

I really like the corn tortilla quesadilla that is on the appetizer menu. I tried to order a vegetarian burrito and they brought me a burrito that was just filled with grilled peppers and onions, like the veggies that come with fajitas. It was inedible, but they made up for it with the live music. There is something totally awesome about a Mexican version of Radiohead's \"Creep\". I have to idea why the guy played it but it was hilarious. That alone made it worth the meal.",

You definately get what you pay for. Each combo comes with chips and salsa (of course), fideo soup, and then a side of rice and beans. For 3 of us our bill came to $37.66. You definitely cannot beat that, especially compared to many other Mexican restaurants.",

I always go for a combination plate because I can never decide on just one thing so I decided to eat three.  The fresh guacamole made table side is a must have.    The service is always top notch. Everyone is very attentive to the guests needs weather it be a refill of water or chips and salsa.  If you cannot decide on what to get ask a server and they will make a recommendation you will not be disappointed with.    These guys are locally owned and operated so be sure to go out and support them.  Sunday they do a brunch with 30 plus items that always look delicious.  I will have to try that one day soon.  Sometimes during the week they have a man playing a piano and singing which can add a nice vibe to your delicious meal.",

The entire staff was professional, timely and attentive to our group of seven.   The food was very good, as expected.  They live up to the self described gourmet Mexican food.  It really was gourmet Mexican food!!   Then after checking in on Yelp we won a free Churro they cut into 4 pieces. Who knew?   Almost everyone needed a carry out container.  (No doggie food here. )  Then I ordered pretty good cheese cake to go. They surprised me with two nice slices that filled the \"go box\". More than expected, just like the customer service.   \"More than expected\" pretty much sums up this review. We liked it!",

The salsa though that had a bite! Send some jalapenos and leave some cholula... tapatio on the table. Tender beef fajita were alright. Nothing special. Prices were higher but portions were large for one person so maybe that reflects the portion sizes? Who knows. But definitely in the future one order of fajitas for us to share. Drinks were weak... I was really disappointed in this even ordering a double and still weak  I'm not an alcoholic but I do like to be able to tell if there's tequila in my drink. Both times could not. Overall with so many options in the area I'll try somewhere else.",

Very unorganized staff. Fire those girls, get new management, turn off reservations if you are not going to Honor them. Maybe some front of house training on customer service, how to speak at a job to customers, and better systems.  And Pamela M I heard your whole phone call it was the girl up front who was rude too you when you came in and not a manager.   Servers were great!   Food is pretty awful.   My suggestion go somewhere else, don't even bother unless you want to be treated like garbage. They don't deserve one star with how they think their customers should be treated.",

I prefer this sit down Mexican spot over the others on the North and North West side. Their weekday happy hour is on point! It starts at 2, they have reasonably priced street tacos, chips and salsa/beans are included, and their large Cadillac margarita (super strong) is $10. Whew.  At dinner, I split the steak fajitas for two with the king of the castle. It was more than enough for us. We ordered table side guac as the app... Mmmmm! I'll always pay extra for that guac. There was so much that we had some leftover, a rare occurrence for our group.   My mom and dad got some combos. They cleaned their plates. Always a good sign, as they can be a bit on the picky side (and trust me, I know. They just stayed with ya for a month LOL).   Service: 5 stars Cleanliness: 5 stars  I'm looking forward to our next visit!",

Went back tonight Against our better judgment and decided we won't be coming back. We sat at the bar so we could gamble while watching the knights game. My bf had beer and I ordered a Cadillac margarita.. About 10 minutes later it still hadn't arrived so I reminded the bartender I ordered one. He said someone must've taken it and remade one for me.  My ribeye was over cooked, I ordered medium and there was absolutely no pink found in it at all. We had to ask twice for more chips, and seemed to be second best compared to the 2 young blondes sitting next to us.",

Management should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this culture in their restaurant! Now I'm wondering if my credit card info is safe after going there!  This was my first time there and I wasn't impressed with the food. It lacked the flavor of an authentic Mexican restaurant! I suggest another place. There are plenty of authentic Mexican restaurants to choose from without worrying about being stolen from.  After talking with Kyle about my experience I feel a little better. He explained that it was a mixup between another transaction and offered me a full refund of the amount that was charged to my card. Not sure how to perceive this? He was very nice and appeared to truly care. I may decide to try again and see if my experience is better. Either way it was very inconvenient to have to follow up and possible expose a problem internally. Let's see if this happens again with another customer.",

This time we did the Sunday brunch which also offered all you can drink as well.   I recommend attempting to make reservations or preparing for a small wait depending on when you go to Michocan.   The food choices were good for brunch but the standout was the omelette station. I really enjoyed that we placed our order at the table and it was brought to us. It seemed like a smaller buffet compared to other Mexican brunch buffets in town but worth the price.   I would love to see a taco station or some dessert choices but for the $15 price, it was worth it. All you can drink margaritas, mimosas or bloody Mary's was only about $7 or $8 more.  We will definitely be back to Michocan for dinner and Sunday brunches.",

Margs are great.  This is such a neighborhood family place to go. I don't know where else we'd go at our end of town if this wasn't here. Wheniever I have had a question or we had a bill issue they have always \"dont the  right thing\".  The customer is king here.  We've been going for 3 years now. Have only good things to say about this place!!!",

    "text": "Lindo Michoacan is an intimate Mexican restaurant. They sport the description \"gourmet Mexican cuisine,\" but it's not fusion, like Agave. They have mostly traditional dishes.   The restaurant doesn't seat many parties, but the floor plan separated sections of the restaurant, making for in intimate setting, as do the booths with high backings and shallow seating. There's a bunch of Mexican decor on the walls, not tacky at all.   Our waiter was warm and available. Between he and the buser, my water was always full. They started us off with chips y salsa y bean dip.   I ordered the Filet Relleno ($20), a white fish stuffed with octopus and shrimp, deep fried, and smothered with Sarandeado sauce. The sauce was pretty much a spicy mayo. But mayo and white fish always wins. Wins!   My mf got the Birria de Chivo ($16), goat cooked in a beer broth with chiles and spices, served with chopped raw onions, cilantro, and tortillas. It was really good. The broth is an intimidating magma-red, but it really wasn't that spicy. The goat meat was tender and tasty and very fatty ... but that's where the flava is.   The prices were reasonable.   I'll be back to try more.   * off the strip, non-casino",

Sad to say, we should have stayed with our first impression.  After we were seated, it took nearly 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge we were there and at least get some water.  This was just the beginning of extremely poor service.  When our food arrived, mine was wrong.  I had ordered beef enchiladas and received chicken.  When I pointed it out to our server, he offered to take it back, but being that my spouse had already been served, it didn't seem fair for their food to go cold while waiting for mine, so I just accepted what they served.  As before, the first time we were there, the food itself barely made mediocre.  Mexican cusine is one of my absolute favorites and this one repeatedly falls short.  There is no life in their plates.  The food just sits there begging to be taken away.  It is bland and unimaginative and very unsatisfying.  I understand that this is one of three or four locations Michoacan has in the greater Las Vegas area.  This one has runied the brand for me and I most assuredly will not be returning here or to any of the other locations.",

Not only do they make fresh corn and flour tortillas, but they also offer dishes not commonly seen in other Mexican restaurants. My personal favorite is their Lengua al Tequila. They also offer table side prepared guacamole with a variety of fixings such as cilantro, jalapenos, lime, and tomatoes. For the most part, the service is highly efficient and the staff is attentive.   The only issue I have with this place is their floor setup. It's like a maze and can get pretty crammed. It can be quite irksome when they seat you at the furthest corner away from the bathroom. If you are claustrophobic, it might bother you. Their waiting area is tiny, which is annoying because if there's extremes of weather, you either cram into the small area or wait outside for a table.",

I went with my friend and her day was equally shitty- we get seated right away and get greeted by a nice server named Vidal, he gets our drink order promptly- as we review the menu.... it is now time to order- this time a man named Juan takes our order..... he appears to be sweating and angry as I ask for the tableside guac he mutters something maybe in English, maybe in Spanish not quite sure.... my friend asked me what he said I said I thought he may have said it's going to be a while to get the guac....??!! Not sure..... lo and behold here comes Vidal  with a beautiful display ready to make our guac- \"senoritas would you like everything?\" Yes! He begins scooping the avocado Softly, passionately, and asks again if we are wanting it all? Cilantro, jalapeno, tomato, onion & limes.... we do!!! He continues on with the next avocado slowly starting to scoop it out.... we feel like this guacamole is exactly what we need and Vidal's passion is evident as he appears to be lovingly putting it together..... WELL like a bull in a China shop here steps in Juan.... muttering something to Vidal.... \"I will do it....\" all of the sudden Juan takes over.... he is angry going fast and hard!!! We don't know what is happening he is throwing the ingredients into the avocado- HARD! As I look over at my friend I tell her not to laugh.... we went from notebook love making guacamole to Fifty Shades of Grey- and then the mix.... the mixing was straight banging and pounding, it was unbelievable..... Juan hands us our bowl, as soon as he walks away we can't breathe as we are trying to catch our breath in between our laughter.... we continue laughing through our entire meal speaking to how amazing the guacamole was but how much more amazing would it have been with Vidal's sweet touch?! We may never know.....we contemplated ordering a second batch to re-create this experience, but we shall commemorate this batch with this review and wait for another batch on our next visit! Highly recommend everything!! Oh and we left in a happy joyful mood, forgetting all about our shitty day!",

I can say that our server was polite and prior to his arrival we received chips and salsa almost immediately but we were dying for drinks. When our food arrived (I ordered the rice with two pork tamales) a sizeable portion of the rice was covered in succotash (which was not good at all) and my wife's burrito also had a large portion of succotash in it. My tamales were crumbly and had little meat inside and pretty bland in taste. We've dined here in the past and had great experiences with our meals so I'm not sure what happened on this last visit. I will say that the staff is very friendly but I probably wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",

    "text": "Feature story: Michoacan  Gourmet Mexican Restaurant  If you want to travel to Michoacan, Mexico without leaving Nevada,  go to The Michoacan Gourmet Mexican Restaurant on Centennial Center. Owner Mark Berry has a passion for the very special place. From the moment you walk in the door you'll see paintings painted by painters admission work on, Mexican hats, the warmth of hand carved wood pillars and insets, that were really brought back by Mark Berry from Michoacan.   From the time you open the double doors you'll be greeted with a smile as though you're family by one of the beautiful hostesses.   The combination plates at the Michigan gourmet Mexican restaurant showcase charming towns in Michoacan, Mexico.  The time you walk through the door will be filled with a feeling of warmth that will surround you:  When you come through the double doors you will see: hand-woven tapestries;  hand carved wood, and you'll smell the aroma of Mexican food native to Michoacan.  From the beautiful tapestries on the wall, to the wood carvings, to the Mexican hats, and hand made pottery, there is life all around the place, the taste of the best Mexican food in Las Vegas and the sound of guitar music playing in the speakers that play music throughout the restaurant.   Not only is the regional specialties delicious from The Michoacan but the people who work there will make you want to return soon.  The people who work at the restaurant are treated like family by Mark Berry the owner and will treat you like family too.

I asked the gentleman could I get the lunch specials delivered for the same price and he said yes! So they just removed the lunch taco special menu off their site.

And I'm not big on guacamole but, they surely make it a show but making it at your table. Fresh guac/anything over boring salsa!",

    "text": "I don't find myself in the area often, but I was in the area visiting with one of my friends who I don't see nearly as often as I should I remember the buzz about the brunch options here.   We arrived around 11 and were seated quickly. The layout of the restaurant is just awkward. The aisles are tight to say the least and the booths were even tighter. As we were sitting the wobbly table bucked up and nearly fell over. Lesson learned, hands off the table. We sat and waited quite some time before anyone approached us for a drink order. This was fine since we were catching up and distracted after not seeing each other for so long.   Eventually a waiter came by to take our drink order but it was hard to get his attention with any more questions since the aisles were so tight as he was talking to other tables. We again sat a while, trying to figure out exactly what to do since no one told us where buffet was and we were tightly crammed in a booth across from a large family that had a child in a high chair that took up most of the aisle. Finally, we headed to the buffet area. It was jam-packed and there was quite a line. We waited patiently, but we were constantly having to move aside to let people pass and vice versa. The line was pretty slow, but we eventually filled our plates and headed back to the table. The food was ok. Nothing amazing, but I did quite enjoy the fresh tortillas and unlimited margaritas and mimosas. I didn't drink too much, but felt I got my money's worth. I think they need to have a better organization process for filling up the buffet as it got pretty sparse with the crowds of people waiting in line. Not sure if they could situate it in a better place in the restaurant but it was definitely in an awkward location since the walkways were narrow and the buffet is also on the way to bathrooms which makes for quite some congestion while people are waiting for their food and while the waitstaff is trying to transport drinks from the bar (which is also in this same small area) to guests.  The food was pretty good and I was happy with the meal. Service was slow to begin with but as we sat there longer the servers finally started coming by with refills more often. I'd come back but maybe a little earlier to avoid the rush and request a table in a more open area of the restaurant, like the bar area, that was easier to get up and down from. I'm actually kind of surprised they didn't try to fill the bar area that is closest to the buffet with those partaking in the brunch and trying to put more a la carte guests in the back harder to get to booths. That's what I would suggest for better flow in the restaurant.",

What made Michoacan a successful venture was the endless margaritas or mimosas, good quality food, and all for $13.95.   The guacamole with cilantro, onions, jalapenos, and limes on the side allows the guest to doctor up the creamy green dip to their specification. All of those sides could also be added into the tripe menudo as well. Those two items would be the highlight of my meal. Other notable items would be the shrimp ceviche, fresh tortillas, and roasted jalapenos. Two plates was my limit, but it was well worth it.    Kyle, our server, was on it. Our table was flooded with margaritas at different points in our meal. There was never a point where we had an empty glass in front of us.",

After 10 more minutes the server finally came and took our order. Fajitas for two and kids chicken fingers for our son, and drink orders finally placed as well. 10 minutes later, the dinner salad came out, but still no drinks. We finally received our drinks several minutes later. Service at this location was awful to say the least.   The server NEVER returned to check on us, refill drinks or anything else. It was as poor service as I have ever experienced. We waited nearly 20 more minutes after we were done with the meal in order to get the check. We asked the busser for to-go boxes, in which she brought one back and literally threw it on the table into the leftovers. That was the final straw. We asked for the manager. When all was explained to him, the manager seemed much less than interested in the issues. He offered no apologies, only dessert.  We asked for the check, and still we waited. Another 5-6 minutes and we had enough. We approached the reception desk and demanded the check at this point.  I can honestly say this will be the last and only visit to this location.",

My favorites today included the Menudo, the Gallo Al Cognac, Shrimp Ceviche, the Huevos dish, and the fantastic Guacamole. The Chile Verde had a tasty sauce to it, but the beef was just too tough.  What puts their Sunday Brunch over the top are the drink-till-you-drop margaritas and mimosas. I didn't try a mimosa, but I had a mango and a strawberry frozen margarita. I also tried the Midori frozen margarita and others in our gathering seemed to enjoy all of the available flavors. You can get a frozen or a classic margarita on the rocks.  I don't venture up these parts often, but I'll keep it in mind the next time I'm looking for a solid Sunday Brunch.",

    "text": "Vegetarians/vegans beware... I ordered vegetable fajitas and they even have a little blurb where you can ask for it to be vegetarian or vegan, and I asked my waiter to make sure my dish was vegan. To me that means there will be no animal products on the plate. There was no sour cream and no cheese which is what I expected, but when my food came out there were two big chunks of steak on it, which together were about the size of my palm, so I asked for a new plate. When the second plate arrived there were two quarter-sized pieces of what looked like ground beef, at which point I stopped digging through it because I didn't feel that I should have to pick through a dish that is advertised as vegetarian to see if there's meat in it. That they specify they can make dishes vegetarian/vegan means they're set up to prepare meatless dishes... right? The waiter was good about it and the manager offered to see that no meat was in the third plate, but I declined it because from what the waiter told me everything is prepared on the same grill. To me that is not at all vegetarian since who knows what other little pieces of meat make it on to \"vegetarian\" orders aside from the big pieces that I saw. I ended up not getting anything else because if it's all made on the same grill and no steps are taken to ensure no cross-contamination happens, that's hardly vegetarian.  That said, everything I did get to eat was pretty good. The guacamole was good and the salsa had a nice heat to it even if it was kind of liquidy. The portions are big although it's a bit expensive. My mother told me her fideo soup was bland but pretty good after she put some of the salsa in. As a vegan, however, I wouldn't feel confident that anything else I got here would be meat-free even though it is advertised as such and I had to write this so other people with my dietary restrictions are aware. At worst I consider it False and deceptive advertising to call a dish vegetarian when it's all made on the same grill with meat and apparently mixed together.   Also at the end of the meal when they brought the check, they had taken my order off but they had also bumped the cost of my mother's meal up by three dollars from what it was on the menu and then taken a weird $4.34 discount off of that total. Overall it was a meh experience, but I am giving two stars because it's a cute little place and if you don't mind random other proteins being on your plate, you may do just fine here.",

    "text": "I hosted a UYE (unofficial Yelp event) for their sunday brunch and the food and service was awesome. I wrote up a detailed review of my last visit and this one was just as good, possibly better. Consistency and value - they get the 5 stars. I think we will come here for Sunday brunch quite often actually.   There was a smaller back room where we were seated. We got sat right away, even though our whole party wasn't here. We were able to make a reservation for it and our table was ready for us at 11:30am.   I wondered if the menu changed per week and this was slightly different from this week to the last time I went. If you're curious of the offerings, they actually update their website menu for that weeks brunch so you know ahead of time what is in store. They keep staples the same but the soup rotated (last week- caldo de res, this week-menudo) and one signature dish changed (last week- shrimp ranchero, this week- gallo al cognac). The rest were consistent to what I thought of last week but these two new items were very good! The menudo was so tender, almost melty. The gallo al cognac was awesome. It had a yummy mushroom creamy sauce.... I don't know how Mexican this is, but it's something similar to a dish I make at home. They ended up being the favorites, along with a lot of people shoveling shrimp ceviche and guacamole in their faces.   The one difference I found out about this visit was about the drinks. Yes, with the $13.95 buffet drinks come with, including mimosas and margaritas and I knew about that....BUT.... I thought that you can get only the house margarita last week, but found out this week you can also request flavors! They had so many, but the popular ones for the group were mango, strawberry, midori, midori pineapple. If you get flavored, they come blended UNLESS you specify on  the rocks. I prefer on the rocks myself.   Service was very good, considering how big our party was and that the rest of the restaurant was also busy. Kyle was our main server and he was friendly and great on trying to keep up on the consistent beverage orders of the group. We had a few hiccups with drink orders, but I don't think having EXTRA margaritas brought to us was a fault at all. If someone wanted rocks and it came blended, someone in our party would want it. One nice touch was that it was Jieun L.s birthday this week and we were talking about it and wishing her well. Our server overheard us and took it upon himself to gather up some of the staff to play instruments and sing to her Mariachi style! They donned her in a giant sombrero and gifted her with a giant tequila shot and churros! It was a really nice touch and a fun highlight in our meal.   I feel like the more people will catch on to this buffet, there's going to be a line to get seated and a price hike. Until then, the BF and I agreed to come often for the great value brunch. This is one of those places that is in my neighborhood and I feel, why haven't I tried this sooner? Finding out about the brunch was a really happy accident.",

Very mild flavor and chilled from obviously having it sit out before serving with the rest.   Overall all too expensive, too long of a wait, and subpar \"food.\"",

It was inspired by a regular customer and I have never had another margarita that is as good anywhere. We support locally owned businesses especially in Centennial Hills/NW.   Mark and ALL of his staff are wonderful - we feel special once we walk in.  Make sure you have the table-side guacamole - made with the freshest avocados from Mexico with the warm fresh chips. Everything on the menus is outstanding.  They have Happy Hour for drinks and food! Great deal for the money. Huge portions for happy hour. They are very accommodating for any size party.  Use their on-line reservations and your table is ready. Their Sunday buffets are full of different choices each week, but they ALWAYS have homemade tortillas that are the best. They send out emails telling about their buffets - menu specials and other events that they offer all the time. They also offer outside seating (covered patio area). Great food - service - location - staff, etc.  This is a must TRY restaurant.",

    "text": "Two of my friends and I came in here on a Sunday afternoon around 4pm. Our waitress with long curly hair was super nice but then after we placed our order she went home without letting us know she was transferring the ticket.   We also asked her if there were any specials. She stated it was happy hour (the table sign said monday through sat but when we questioned she said it was indeed happy hour and $2 wines) so we ordered HH drinks.   I ordered food a la carte - a shrimp taco and a cheese enchilada. We also shared tableside guacamole which was awsome. The shrimp taco was great, the enchilada was just meh.   SO as I mentioned the waitress went home and no one came up to check on us for the longest time. we finally had to flag down a waiter who brought out the bill. We discovered that we had been charged full price for our drinks plus they added an additioanal wine to the bill which I did not order. We explained what we were told to the new waiter, and he brought out manager Jose. At first he wouldn't budge except to take off the wine then he agreed to honor what the original waitress told us. It was really the principle of the thing, we weren't trying to be cheap or take advantage. Everything was fine except for the drink ordeal whchi was handled accordingly.",

My husband loves the carnitas, flautas, and sopitos.   We have recently discovered their brunch buffet and I'm now amiss that we hadn't been going for years prior. Most of their best menu options are available but the best thing is the pan dulce. I don't know if they make it in house or have it brought in but the conchas are to die for.  The biggest reason we have been regular patrons so long and will continue to be is the staff. Some of the servers have literally watched our kids grow up. They're always so kind and effecient.",

We were super dehydrated so we were finishing our drinks left and right but are glasses never went empty.   I decided to order Gorditos de Camaron which is a rolled flour tortilla filled with shrimp, tomatoes, onions, and a bit of jalapenos. It's deep fried and smothered in cheese and served with guacamole on the side. It was so yummy and even though this was an appetizer it was huge! I couldn't finish it all so I took the rest home.   The service here is fantastic and very understanding. While we were waiting on the food we got a call from the car dealership saying to hurry back . My husband had to tell the waiter that as soon as we get the food we need the check right away . They not only did that but knowing we were in a hurry we had like four people from the wait staff checking on us to make sure we were okay. It was really refreshing to have everything go so smoothly amongst all the stress.",

We started with chips and salsa which came with an incredible bean dip. We also ordered guacamole which was prepared table side. They use 2 guacamole's and quite a bit of pics de gallo and onions which makes for a huge dish of phenomenal guacamole. My friend was full after the chips but I had to try the al Pastor. The al Pastor at Michoacan rates up there with the absolute best that I have ever tasted inside or outside of Mexico! Three tacos packed with al pastor, shredded lettuce and cheese. The tacos were accompanied by the usual Spanish rice and retried beans. Good sides but they can't stand up to the rest of the food that we ate.  Service is very friendly. The establishment is clean and well taken care of. Our food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. You can't ask for more at a local Mexican restaurant.",

Recently one of our favorite Mexican restaurants closed and we were driving by Michoacan's after church Sunday morning and thought we'd finally give it a try.   Upon arrival there were several people outside as well as standing in the doorway and once we got closer we realized why--the entrance and waiting area was tiny. I managed to squeeze myself through to get our name on the list so we had about a 20 minute wait. They were also setting up for their Sunday Brunch Buffet which seemed to account for many of the patrons.   Although the restaurant seems small there is actually quite a bit of seating that wraps around to the bar area and even outside. The decor is what you would expect for a Mexican restaurant with nothing over the top. They have an extensive menu with almost too many options so I had a hard time deciding. But I finally committed to the Campenchana along with an a la carte shrimp enchilada. My Hubby opted for his usual: cheese & shredded beef enchiladas. The meal was very enjoyable. I was happy the black beans were actually blacke beans and not mashed with lard like regular refried beans like so many restaurants seem to do.   Although our server was a little slow we didn't really mind as were relaxing and enjoying everything,   I would certainly go back, as there are other items I'd like to try on the menu.",

We came in at the beginning of their Happy Hour- good time to come if you want to maximize your dollar. We ordered 2 Mango margaritas along with a cheese quesadilla. The Mango margaritas were okay. They were heavy on the tequila but the mango lacked flavor. Not sure what that was about but it wasn't too bad because we did manage to finish the drink.   We came here because I was craving Mexican food. I specifically wanted Cheese Enchiladas with green sauce. My friends ordered a burrito and a Flautas plate. Their food came as they had ordered it but unfortunately, my enchiladas came in red sauce. I immediately told our waiter and it was quickly fixed.  Food was okay. Not sure if I'd come back here again.  Considering how slow it was (2pm) their service was extremely slow. Even after we received our food the waiter only came once to check up on us. So if you're not in a hurry or have time to wait around come here.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that Michoacan is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant. I crave it regularly and I am NEVER disappointed by the food. The reason for the 3 stars? One work. Cesar. Cesar is the worst server I have ever come across in any restaurant. The last 3 times I've been, I have asked to not sit in Cesar's section(it's that bad). He is rude, inattentive, and when you ask \"what happened to our food?\" He walks away, has someone else bring it out (after an hour), and never returns to apologize. That has happened to us TWICE. I have gone to the manager and of course they apologize and promise to handle it but he is there EVERY SINGLE TIME we are so I'm guessing he's related to the owner. Just search \"Cesar\" in the reviews and you will see MULTIPLE complains on him. Michoacan should be mortified that they have multiple complaints on Yelp AND get complaints regularly in person and they still have him working there. It's unfortunate that such a wonder place can be brought down by one individual. The rest of the staff has been nothing but wonderful. Literally all of them. So.. I HIGHLY recommend you eat here and ask to not be in Cesar's section. You won't regret it.",

I had to spit a lot of it out and that was embarrassing. I should have gone to Rio Cafe, I would have had way better food and it would have cost me way less. If you want a nice mexican restaurant, go to Viva Mercado on west Sahara.",

We asked about  a soup that we liked  but it was Not available with the meals anymore and there would be a $2.50 charge for it. We have not been there in a while so we figured that a new manager or owner changed the menu or rules. Lin had a Beef & Cheese burrito and she said it was nowhere as good as before. I had a street taco that was fine for me and the chips & dips were ok. Overall it was Not what we thought it would be but things change and we are sorry to say but we will have to take this off our itinerary for Mexican Food.",

I placed an order using <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchownow.com&s=5364e9714fd3f8be77d8bdcad06ea113835dbc9ab4e972b5e7a15cfc539827e2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">chownow.com</a> at around 6:25pm. I called the restaurant a few minutes later to see how long it would take and they pulled up my order by name and said it would be ready in 20 minutes. I arrived at the restaurant at 7pm. A young lady came to help me and I told her I was picking up an order. She confirmed that I had ordered through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchownow.com&s=5364e9714fd3f8be77d8bdcad06ea113835dbc9ab4e972b5e7a15cfc539827e2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">chownow.com</a> and then started helping another customer who had walked in after me. Several groups arrived, waited, and were seated as I just stood there waiting. The same girl who helped me in the beginning was still at the podium, along with another girl now. Finally, after 15 minutes, the second girl came up and asked what I was waiting for. I told her about my order and after some back and forth she told me the order had never been put in. I was shocked. I had spoken to them on the phone, and then in person when I arrived... and yet no one ever put in my order?? The manager only bothered to speak with me directly when I told the girl I wouldn't wait for the food to cook. He told me the food would be ready in 10-15 mins, but I had already been waiting for over 15 minutes and he didn't even take accountability for the mistake and try to fix it. At least two of his employees were aware of my order (the first girl at the podium and the person I talked to on the phone), and yet nothing. The manager was very apologetic, but that doesn't give me back my hour of wasted time. He finally gave in and canceled the order and I left. If he had just made an effort to make up for the mistake, maybe I'd be writing a very different review right now. Like I said, we're very disappointed... and hungry.",

Every single visit to Michoacan our wait staff has been very good. They are always friendly and quick to refill your drink.   One of my favorite Bean dips is brought to your table before your meal along with chips and a great hot sauce. By the way, save some of the hot sauce to use on your meal. The bean dip is warm and just the perfect consistency.   I have enjoyed the Carne Asada platter on several occasions. The Carne Asada has very good flavor and the meat is tender and juicy.  We dined at Michoacan last week for our 18th wedding anniversary. On that occasion, I tried the Chile Relleno. It was an egg-batter dipped large chili pepper stuff with a wonderfully gooey melty cheese. It was wonderful and I would recommend it highly. The Chile Relleno plate also came with a delicious chicken taco. There was a large amount of chicken stuff into the taco with a crunchy shell along with lettuce and tomato. I used some of the hot sauce I saved from before to place inside the taco.   I would highly recommend visiting Michoacan! You won't be dissapointed !",

My husband is very picky about menudo, he had their menudo and beef tamales. I had the chicken fajitas and we have to say we will definitely come back. We sat at the bar, Madison who was behind the bar was awesome. Hubby wanted to watch the UCLA vs Oklahoma game because he wanted to see UCLA get demolished ( SC fan hates Chip), Madison put the game on upon request. Great and friendly service. Highly recommend this place.",

We tried to order our food and he seemed that he wasn't interested in anything we said my wife's food was wrong she asked for cheese on top of her meal which didn't come on It. I ordered the shrimp tacos which Fernando asked if I wanted battered shrimp or grilled I said battered when my meal arrived they were grilled and by this time I just ate the food that came cause I didn't want to wait anymore, our waters where always empty and It took them about 10 minutes to fill the water every time (as they walked by and saw they were empty). At the end of our meal we waited at least 15 minutes for our server to drop our check off so I went to the front and asked the hostess if she could get my check for me since I didn't want to wait any longer. It was crazy how horrible our server Fernando was, we will not be eating at this place again and I would urge anyone thinking about trying this place to go somewhere else!",

Aside from the terrible food, the service was wonderful and the drinks..were drinks. Would not recommend this location and we will definitely not be returning.",

The place seemed very cramped however, thinking they were looking for that homey feel ( which I think they got but it isn't my cup of tea) so the atmosphere I give 3.5 stars.   Overall pretty good and I'll more than likely be back for sit down Mexican food.",

We ordered food and we waited till 8:45 and no food came. All we got was our drinks and chips. I had to ask for the soup because they didn't even bring it to us. So I ask the waiter about where our food was.. He said their thermal printer ran out of paper so they put a new roll in and our food will be out in 5 mins. We couldn't wait any longer because our friend had to go to work. My question is that if the printer was out of paper then why did everyone around us that got there after Us got their food?  If the waiter would've just kept up and realized we haven't gotten our food in 20-30 mins he should've known something was wrong. The problem is, they messed up.. And now they will lose a good customer. Like I said, my husband and I eat there at least once a week. Looks like we will be taking our business elsewhere . We got up and left, after waiting for over an hour for our food. I told the manager and he acted like he didn't even know anything and didn't care. The waiter should've told the manager what happened and the manager could've at least came to our table and apologize. We got nothing.  If I could give this place negative 100 stars right now I could. Not only we left with empty starving stomachs but we also left feeling like this place didn't give two sh*ts about customer service.",

    "text": "I eat a lot of mexican food.  I grew up in San Diego and mostly just called mexican food, \"food\"  we had it so much.  Im pretty tolerant of different interpretations of it and all that being said this place has bad food.   Heres the thing though it wasn't so much that it wasn't very flavorful (it really was sorta bland) it was the the 4 tablespoons of water on the plate that sogged the taco to where it fell apart when picked up.  It wasn't the coalgluted cheeses on the the chicken enchilada in tomatillo sauce not being melted enough and just pooled on the side of the enchilada like white cement, or the fact the whole plate seemed to have been tossed together in like 3 minutes put under a broiler (not even long enough to melt the cheese).  And then brought out for me to try and eat.  It came with a chile reano that was actually pretty good but the rancho sauce or salsa it was served with was broken.  maybe thats where all the extra water on the plate came from.  Olives and lima beans in the rice?   I know every places rice is different, however this was also dry and crisp indicating it was old and had been sitting out.  The beans were ok.  Service was great and i felt bad telling the waiter i was unhappy when he asked.  I showed him how the water pooled up on the plate (again where did all this water on the plate come from?) and that the shredded beef taco was chicken and a soggy mess with no crispness at all from sitting in the plate water.   it was awful, so soggy I couldn't even pick it up before it exploded on the plate.  Disappointed. As the wife and I had wanted to eat here a long time.  Don't understand how this place has gotten anything in the way of good reviews.  maybe it was an off night.  but the kitchen should have never let that plate go out like that.  that they did indicates to me no one at the pass and it must be the status quo.  I would avoid this place, robertos does a better job.  Seriously..Robertos.  never again.",

I live in California and was able to reserve their patio area for my 40 guests, they put the King robe, crown and scepter on my father-in-law (which I provided), walked him through the restaurant where we all waited for him to walk into the patio area on his red carpet (I provided) to yell \"surprise\". They allowed me to come an hour and a half early so that I could decorate the patio with my own decorations and even provided me with 2-extra 6 ft. tables to put my collage pictures, cake, and presents on. They even enclosed the patio and set-up portable heaters to keep us warm; due to the cold weather.    The accommodations were amazing!  I was able to choose different options from their menu for our guests to choose from and they made me personalized menus for my guests which kept the cost low to fit my budget. We had chips, salsa, guacamole and nachos as our appetizers and our guests had the choice of: Fajitas for 2, 3 Tacos plate (Carne Asada, Pollo Asado, or Carnitas), Burritos, along with a kids menu and much more. Once our servers took   everyone's individual orders, our food was out hot, fresh and Delicious within 30 minutes. We had family and friends fly in from: California, Arizona, Oklahoma and Colorado and every single one of my guests complemented on the food and service they were provided. They even cut the cake we brought and served it to each of our guests and made sure my father-in-law was served first!!   I have my own Mexican food catering service in California (Baja Style Tacos Catering Service) and I have very high standard and I have to say, I was very impressed with everything they did for me, their food was great and I highly recommend Michoacan!    I can't thank you all enough for taking so much stress off of me while I was trying to put this birthday party together for my father-in-law from California and made it a special day we will all never forget.   Thank you,  Inga Garner",

    "text": "Jade's UYE Sunday Brunch/Game Day was a wonderful opportunity to see the Yelperazzi, some I haven't seen since Nerdy Dancing 2! Due to a prior commitment, I arrived late (and several rounds of Margaritas) into the meal. Somehow I missed that it was a buffet: but I was so happy to be there, phobias did not take over.   Seated next to the lovely Sylvia Q, I quickly grabbed Shrimp Ceviche, Huevos, beans & rice, a homemade tortilla and a bowl of guacamole with fixins and a spoon. I do not kid when saying eating guac with a spoon is normal for me. Our super amazing waiter Kyle kept the drinks flowing: I tried a frozen Mango Margarita, and a sip of Sylvia's Midori but he gladly switched it out for one on the rocks. Our table looked like a Margarita rainbow! The food offerings included menudo and lots of carnivore food that I don't eat, but it looked good. Safe to say pescetarians & vegetarians who eat eggs can leave sated. I'm not a chips and salsa person, but they, too were plentiful.   This was a bargain at $13.95 per person AYCE & AYCD including ALL margarita varities and mimosas. The service was on point even though the back room we were in was shared with a second large party. Water glasses were replenished; they even had a mini mariachi group complete with sombrereo, churros, candles and a large tequilla shot because Kyle overheard it was Jieun's birthday. Now THAT'S lovely. Not too far at all from Summahood to take advantage of good food, atmosphere and service for Sunday brunch (the menu changes weekly)  Many thanks to the always incredible Jade W for hosting and inviting us all to an epic game afternoon at her home later. Great times made better by even greater company.   Yelp 100 Challenge",

The funniest thing from this restaurant is that they sing to you and put a sombrero on you for your birthday, oh and you get a free churro! Recommended for family fun!",

The soup was tasteless, I had to throw our salsa in it to add flavor (salsa was delicious!) The chicken taco doesn't stand a chance next to Juan's Flaming Fajitas (Trop and Ft Apache) or Casa Don Juan (Main St). It was pretty mediocre and had yellow cheese on it (yuck!) Our server seemed nice but very dry and not friendly at all. He especially got a little annoyed with me when I told him they added chicken in my soup that I had asked for with no chicken. Our food also took about 30-35 min to come out, with only about 5 tables in the entire restaurant. We'll stick to one of the Juans I previously mentioned to get our Mexican on from now on. This location ruined it for me.",

I live on the complete opposite side of town, but it was well worth the trip.  I don't know how to gauge distance to time in Vegas.  Needlessly to say, I was early.  But, that's okay, I don't mind being early.  The 8 of us were seated in the back room.  Good move as the language can get a little \"Salty\".  Especially after the all you can drink margaritas and mimosas kick in.  I took advantage of that aspect of the buffet.  Which, by the way, was $13.95, with the drinks included.  The food was good, for the buffet.  I had a huge plate, then focused my attention on the bottomless margaritas.  Our waiter was great and on the ball.  The highlight was the singing of Happy Birthday and Kathy wearing a sombrero.    I think we were there for 3 hours just drinking and cracking wise.  I would make the drive again to hang out with this group.  Good times were had!",

So if you are doing to try them don't go here!",

The plan was to go to Olive Garden but the wait was an hour so my husband and I decided to give Michoacan a shot.  We walked in and there was a small empty table right by the server station. The hostess told me it was going to take 30 minutes to an hour with only a large group waiting.  When I looked at the table than looked at the hostess she corrected herself than immediately sat us. We thought we got lucky until I realized she told everyone it was a hour wait but could be 5 minutes then everyone including a table of 11 was quickly seated.  I noticed on both the food and drink menus that there are extra charges for almost everything.  I got flautas and had to pay extra for flour tortillas and any flavor additions to the margaritas cost more and all thru the menu its $1for this or $ 2 for that.  I thought it was a little tacky.   My husband got a shrimp burrito and said it was rubbery.  The flautas were just Ok.  The guacamole was good. My husband actually ate it which is rare for him.    All and all it was edible but if Olive Garden is full again I will drive elsewhere.",

Can't really argue with AYCE Brunch with bottomless mimosas/margaritas for $14. That my friends, is a STEAL.  Service was fairly good, no complaints. I left early compared to the others so I may not have gotten my full $14 worth but I had a few mimosas and a plate of food so I'm not complaining :)",

    "text": "After getting my swole on at the gym I hit up my broski Milkshake to grab some food. He tells me about this Mexican restaurant called Michoacan. At first I thought he was talking about the new Mexican Transformers movie similar to the Decepticons. Sadly he wasn't and we were headed on our way.   After we parked we started walking towards the restaurant and all of a sudden a young African American urban youth appears on some cheap poverty scooter. I didn't think kids rode those things anymore. The 10 yr old compliments my bro on his legit/10 tats and then asks us for a dollar! His homies were prolly laughin at his broke a$$. So my bro goes \"yo kid, you way too young to begging for money. How about you get a job?\" I started lol'ing and as we walked inside, the urban youth yells \"hobos!\" I was like this cant be real tea.    We walked in and said \"2\". The Latinas were mirin. They knew our status. We sit down and in 2 minutes ordered waters and a beer. After grubbing on dat dere nachos with bean dip we ordered fajitas and a burrito. Chicken burrito.    The bar was starting to get packed with overweight blonde girls with a tattoo on her back that said \"American Girl Bada$$\" or something like that. I lol in my head and continued the conversation with my bro. Server was great and so was the food. There was an older Mexican dude playing the keyboard. Every song sounded the same. Some kind of Mariachi music. It reminded me of the time when I was in SA at the Alamo.    Despite the urban youths running around outside trying to hustle, I would definitely eat here again.",
