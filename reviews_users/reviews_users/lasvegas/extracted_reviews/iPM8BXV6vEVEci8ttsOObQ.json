    "text": "Seriously, wth??? The \"Wal-Mart\" of Pho establishments, in my opinion.  (And that's being generous.)    Came in tonight (Sunday) around 8:30pm; less than half empty.  Took over ten minutes just to get greeted.  We ordered:  Appetizer:  Egg Rolls.  Which came out extremely overcooked.  I asked the server if they had soy sauce since most places already have it on the table, and she said \"yes\", and just stared at me blankly.  I said \"well, can I have some please?\".  She left and eventually came back with it about 5 minutes later.  Boyfriend:  Steak Pho, which he said tasted pretty bland.  Me:  Vegetable Pho with extra veggies.  Broth was very sweet, and pretty gross.  I tried adding soy sauce, jalepenos, pepper, anything and everything to make it edible; which didn't help.  The only veggies that were in the soup were baby corn, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, and mushrooms.  Cauliflower? Really?  No bok choy, no cabbage.. Needless to say was VERY disappointed.  Being a vegetarian and having eaten at countless pho places, I was sorry I even ordered it.  Daughter:  Kid's Meal chicken nuggets and fries.  She had no complaints, but then again, she eats my cooking.  Not very easy to mess that up.  Service:  Polite at first.  Gentleman that took our order and delivered our entrees was nice.  Orders were correct.  Then, he disappeared and we had no service whatsoever throughout our entire meal.  We were finished eating and were waiting to ask for a container and the check for over 15 minutes.  A young lady appeared and asked the table next to us (that came in after us) if they needed anything, as they were just finishing up.  They asked for a container, and the lady took her soup to box it up, and didn't even look our way.  Not sure how she missed us, because we were basically sitting right on top of them.  5 minutes later she brings them their box and check and walks away.  My boyfriend literally had to yell \"excuse me\" to get her to even acknowledge our existence.  We asked for a container and the check, which she brought relatively promptly.  AND THEN... we get to the cashier and she THEN informs us that it's \"cash only\".  I thought my boyfriend's head was going to spin around at that point.  SERIOUSLY??!  Who, in this day and age, doesn't accept cards of any kind?? While my boyfriend was at the ATM, I, at least, looked around for any signs stating that it is cash only.  ONE. One tiny, single sign stuck at the bottom of the window to the kitchen.  That's it.  So, you know, just in case the kitchen workers forget they can't use their card..  Fortunately, my boyfriend doesn't have to pay any ATM fees, due to his military debit card.  Had we had to pay a fee, though, there would have been a problem.  That is it for the rating part, but just in case you are enjoying my rant, below I will tell you about the farm animals sitting all around us...  Tables are very close together, and a couple was seated at the table next to us at a table for 4, and the server purposely put the menus on the opposite end of their table, so as to give us room.  Nope.  They move over right next to us, pretty much sitting in our laps.  As we wait for our food, chick next me starts playing videos on her phone at FULL VOLUME, so loud that we can't carry on a conversation.  Didn't help that the music was blaring in the restaurant, also.  Then, a group of 5 adults, one child, probably 4 years old, get seated behind us.  They all start hugging in the aisle like they've not seen each other in decades, and just continue to stand there talking while the kid runs all over the place.  Keep in mind, the restaurant is very small.  They finally sit down and are talking so loud and making so much noise, you would have thought they were at home in their own dining room.  All the while, they are completely ignoring the kid as she takes out ALL of the chopsticks (not wrapped, they were plastic) and plays with them, before putting them back again.  Gross.  Table next to us gets their food, and the chick next to me is slurping her soup louder than any CHILD EVER would.  It was ridiculous.  I seriously began to think that I was On a hidden camera show, or Punk'd, or something.  All around, a very painful visit from beginning to end. Rant over.",

I waited for her to go wash her hands since she didn't cough into her elbow but nope! Never did. Not only did she CONTINUE coughing into her hands but she also blew her nose in the kitchen & picked her boogers. Does she not know the glass is clear & we can all see her?? It's disgusting. After she blew her nose I also watched her prepare food for another guest that has no idea she never washed her hands after all that. I'm scared to even ask for a to-go box. I love the 2 for 1 dumplings & I've been here so many time but this will be my last time coming to Jenni pho. I don't want to get sick.",

My buddy ordered the Chicken Pho and it came out first from the rest of our pho, except his soup was warm (suitable to eat right away while each of ours were scolding hot) and the chicken was FAR UNDERCOOKED and the waiter insisted that that was the way it was in their restaurant. I've never seen pho like that before.   I noticed in the kitchen that there was a huge vat left on low heat just sitting there, which is probably where the Chicken Pho came from.   The waiter did offer us a voucher for a free bowl of pho for our next visit, but we would never come back here.",

The pot stickers were buy one get one (rock on!) which was a nice surprise. The pho - was delicious! Soooo delicious I did a take-out session later on in the week. The takeout was bland and blah. It lacked the punch and pizzaz I had experienced in house.  :)  Hooray for dine-in.....  :( Boo for takeout",

    "text": "I wasn't feeling pho so I went with the honey chicken vermicelli (didn't seem to have regular chicken on the menu). However, I did try the pho a few years ago, and I don't recall having any problems with it and friend who ordered it seemed to be satisfied.  Surroundings - nearby many other restaurant options offering a good variety of different cuisines to choose from, no issue with parking  Atmosphere - casual, normal pho restaurant, \"open\" kitchen where there's glass around so you can see them cook your food  Menu - offers the normal appetizers including egg rolls and spring rolls, regular pho options (I believe you can choose up to 5 items to put in your pho and customize as well), vermicelli, a few specialty dishes, boba, and dessert. I took a glance at the dessert menu and I believe it had mini cheesecakes and truffles which was interesting. My order, the chicken vermicelli, tasted great, decent portion size, and came in a pretty bowl. However, despite the time it took to get my food, my chicken came out a little undercooked. Other than that, no complaints. It satisfied my taste buds and grumbling tummy :)  Service - slow, but kind. There was only one other table besides ours and there seemed to be ample employees (serving and cooking); however, our food took longer than it should have. It's probably the longest I've ever had to wait for food at a vietnamese restaurant. Perhaps it was because we came near closing... not sure exactly what the issue was there.  If I have a random pho craving, I'd probably go back due to it's proximity.",

Got my to go order within 5min, and they seem to have good service - 2 passing servers offered me water while I waited.   Unfortunately the pho was pretty average w really bland broth and their flank steak was about 90% fat and gristle. I only tried Jenni pho because its in my hood and I felt like sh*t, but I probably should've taken the trip to Chinatown for something decent.   I may try their broken rice dishes sometime, but I definitely wont be returning for the pho.",

The restaurant is cozy with booths and tables and they let you sit anywhere you'd like. I also appreciate that the kitchen is transparent and you get to sight-see the chefs hard at work. I've also enjoyed their spring rolls (goi cuon), which were excellently and freshly prepared. Their vermicelli noodle dished are also great. I don't work here and am not associated with the restaurant, I'm just a regular customer that knows a good thing when I experience it. Sharing the love is all!!!",

Walked in, most tables were occupied, sat down, waited for about 15 minutes until someone asked what I wanted to drink, waited another 15 mins for someone to come back with my drinks (water) & to take my order.  We ordered pot stickers, spring rolls, pho & a vermicelli dish. One taro slush & one avocado slush.  30 mins went by.. No food.  I don't know how I sat there for 30 mins without even saying a word. My boyfriend hates it when I complain about bad customer service at a restaurant because he thinks they'll really spit in our food.  45 mins came around & the pot stickers, spring rolls & vermicelli dish came out at the same time.  Boyfriends #1 pet peeve is when the appetizers & main entrees come out at the same time.  But anyway, we ate.  15 mins go by.. Still no pho for me.  At this point, I notice all the tables around us that came after us were pretty much almost done with their food.  I got up & walked over to the kitchen.  Long story short, I left unhappy & they seemed to not care at all. The food was horrible. The slushy drinks tasted like mold.. The Avocado one to be exact.  I once was eating at a Hawaiian BBQ by my house & overheard someone at the table next to me say that he worked at Jenni Pho. Which is how I heard of the place. I also overheard him saying that sometimes he has to call the owner & remind her to pay him his paycheck. I should've taken that as a RED FLAG.  NEVER GO THERE",

The only reason why I gave jenni pho another chance was because it was so close to the house and the food was pretty good. So I went back a week later to order my salt n pepper around dinner time but the waiter ask me to order somthing else cause the chef was not there, are you kidding me? 4 guys in the kitchen making pho but you can't make salt n pepper shrimp? Haha they recommended me pho again so I was like NO THANKS YOU. Not going back again even if GROUPON have special hahahh.",

What more do you want for a local little Pho place with great prices and service. We always get good service and the Seafood or Rare Steak Pho is my favorite. The broth is savory and never bland. It's not too salty ( I LOVE SALT) just perfect temperature and the portions are huge. I love their potstickers and egg rolls. I also had their Vermacelli tomato Seafood with no squid and that was pure heaven too. Their sauces on the table are great quality. The open kitchen window is very nice and allows you to see what a small kitchen can put out, which is deliciousness in a bowl. Their boba flavored drinks are all very good, THey have a huge selection of endless iced, coffee, smoothie and teas with or without boba they're all REALLY TASTEY! I live close by and so happy I can go there at least once a week. I love Pho and have had many and this is right up there if not better than some of the Spring Mountain Phos. PLUS they are VERY friendly, they aren't all weird and rude just because I'm not Vietnamese like some places are in Spring Mtn. Don't knock it till you try it and I would say I have a very sofisticated palate and have a good sense for what's good & bad. I'm not picky I'll try anything once. This place is a must!  I promise if you order a simple Pho to start with for those of you who are just starting you won't be dissapointed. LOVE THIS PLACE I'm gonna go now just writing this review made my mouth water!  Cash only but you can eat like a King with $20",

But I do have to say it's better than Saigon 8 (I think they bribed the columnists) sneaky azians.....meat was ok, not alot of noodles here.....they have a see through kitchen which is different, they usually don't like you to see the kitchen in case they drop something (u know that happens all the time in asian joints) but nice decor either way.  til next  time, good eating!  I'm still on a search for really good Pho.....",

I make my own pho at home about once a month so I know a few things about pho.  Jenni Pho I would rank as one of the worst pho i've ever eaten.  The broth is epic FAIL.  It's flavorless, it lacks the subtle charred onion and ginger flavor, the meaty and rich taste that comes from oxtail and bone marrow, and the spices of cinnamon, cloves, and star anise.  The noodle was ok but the rare sliced steak came out over cooked.  The size was decent but I didn't want to finish it.  I left disappointed but knowing that since i've had the worst, i know my next pho experience else where has to be better.",

My friend told me about the broths mad how it tastes better than most other places. That right there got me because I do enjoy drinking soup broths! So I got the flank and steak pho while my brother got the honey chick, my brother got the charbroiled pork, and my dad got the Jenni pho, which has all the meats that you can add. We also got the fresh spring rolls as our appetizers, just to see how they are.   When our spring rolls came, they were pretty standard like you would get at any other Vietnamese place. The sauce was a little bit different than most  other places though. The sauce had a peanut taste to it, but also this Chinese pasty/bread aftertaste to it, which I particularly liked. It might be weird that I like that pastry aftertaste, or even that I could even tell that it was there. That could just be me being weird, but the sauce was good!  When our food came, the first thing I wanted to do was to try their broth, and it was different than most places too, and in a good way! Their noodles and meats are pretty standard. Their prices were fairly standard as well for the amount of food that came, and it was a pretty decently sized bowl; I was satisfied. My mom's chicken was pretty good. It was juicy and tender the whole way around. My brother's pork was pretty tasty as well.   Overall, the food was really good. I enjoyed it a lot, maybe a little more than Pho So 1 or Pho Kim Long I would say. That's really subjective, but there was nothing about Jenni Pho I didn't like. The service was even good! Our server Justin was really helpful and checked up on us regularly. If you're in the area, give this place a shot!",

    "text": "I feeling some broken rice on my day off and decided too mix it up rather then go too my GO spot. Epic mistake on my part. I just should have stuck with the Pho action. I ordered the grilled pork chop and shrimp also comes with egg custard (name not sure) of sorts. First impression was WOW talk about lot of rice too everything else on the plate. Trust me huge fan of rice grew up on it. If I wanted all rice would have asked for side of rice. The pork chop was good. It was moist, nice grill marks, and nice flavor. The shrimp was solid too. The egg custard was ok nothing special. Here my problem is felt like with all that rice, not enough meat (the pork chop is thin cut and shrimp not u10), and the disproportion not working for me. My favorite spot for broken rice Pho Bosa they give you ample rice too but  everything else you get more of the good stuff!  The prices are very reasonable at Jenni Pho. Most dishes notice was under ten dollars. They have two for one special on there boba drinks. If one that need pic rather then description Jenni Pho has pictures of all the items on the menu. If short on cash have ATM right next too the front door.  I had mango ice tea with boba. Honestly  think that was the one thing that stood out for me more then the food. It was refreshing drink. No caffeine, really no sugar, and add the boba. Awesome.   Still need too try the Pho but if looking for good broken rice dish no one can beat Pho Bosa in my opinion. I love Pho will be back too give that go.",

Every time we were completely happy with this dish, number C6 on the menu, with the shrimps and egg.  We usually order one plate for each of us.  Other than this, we believe other dishes are great but just didn't have the chance to try because we love the pork rice too much.  The servers are very polite and attentive with smiles on their young faces all the time.",

The pho broth was super hearty and rich and delicious.   That was the FIRST time I came here a few weeks ago.   We came back yesterday and based on yesterdays experience I don't think I want to come back here.  The pho broth was NOT rich, hearty OR super delicious. I don't know what happened!  I also need to remember that the Spring Rolls here are NOT the business. Too much lettuce and not enough noodles!  The Egg Rolls WERE good though, but the Shrimp Rolls were NOT.   Next time Imma go back to my regular spot, Pho Annie!",

I to go the food, so it is super important that they don't over cook the noodles because once we open the container when we got home, it was a big blob of noodles.    Overall, Pho broth is decent, decent amount of meat, but the noodles can be done better.  Would we order food here again?  Maybe.",

Visited Vancouver, and Australia, so I have a good feel for the Pho game.  Jenni Pho at it's price point is one of the cleanest and nicest looking Pho restaurants I've ever been in (Bamboo Bistro is nice too). The service is uneven, but they are courteous, and it doesn't have that cafeteria feel. I've been in nicer Pho spots, but they are far more expensive. That made me want to give it five stars alone.  The Pho was delicious. The broth wasn't greasy, and the meat was bright red. So it wasn't sitting around or allowed to cook to hide its freshness or lack of. But after all is said and done... it's just consistently good Pho ... nothing special... not five stars.... 4 1/2  I eat here when in the area and want Pho, but prefer Bamboo Bistro for my regular spot.  Oh! parking is scarce during peak hours.",

    "text": "Tonight I had the opportunity of meeting the owner Jenni of Jenni Pho. We are fairly new to Blue Diamond, Las Vegas and I have been wanting some authentic soup. This location is conviently located less than 2mi from my house and shopping malls. The ambience of this restaurant is spectacular. It's upkeep and cleanliness is superb. Parking availability around the restaurant makes it seamlessly easy to arrive. This location is a Cash only restaurant. They do have an ATM inside, however, today the ATM was out of service. Easy fix- Walgreens! It would be nice to have an electronic payment option or even invest into a apple/droid Swipe adapter for card payments. Today I ordered the B9- Cold Honey grilled  chicken Vermicelli Noodle dinner. I personally wanted it hot but it comes cold (heated). As I wS waiting for my to go dinner, Jenni (owner) walks in and greets us. She asked what I was having. I mentioned to her I was going to take it home and add hot water. She advised me that adding hot water would take away the authentic Pho Flavors of the meal. So she insisted I take home some hot chicken broth w/green onions and try eating it separately. So I did! It was delicious. She's definitely a owner for a reason and knows how to appeal to her clients/customers. I am very pleased with her customer service and the quality of her food. Selections are made easy here, nothing complicating. Thanks Jenni for the amazing service, you definitely have my loyalty.",

The pho is good and it's a bonus that they have crab rangoon as an appetizer on the menu since you won't find it at many Vietnamese joints.   The pho is only good not amazing and the service is lacking from time to time. Hence the 4 star rating, not 5.   Just today, I stopped by and after I finished eating I was just sitting there playing on my iPhone and she cleared everything off my tables including my drinks. Kind of like \"Go play on your phone somewhere else, white boy!\" Haha! I thought it was funny though.   Honestly though, they are mostly on top of their game with service.

The Bad: The service is abrupt and aloof. I went to pick up take out and the guy behind the takeout counter was surfing the internet, apparently I was SEP and rather than say something polite like \"the cashier will be here shortly\" he just chose to make it mega-awkward and surf (what I assume was some highly captivating pornography) defiantly.  When you get Pho in the restuarant you feel like you're getting a ton of meat. When you get it via take out and get to see it in it's deconstructed form, you're getting about a dollars worth of lunch meat. Not good. I strongly suspect you get far more meat for dining in.  Horrifying: The meatballs, like a lot of Pho places, are just bad. Also they are almost perfectly evocative of reproductive organs. I believed this was my palate until I had good traditional Pho balls at other Pho restaurants. The same is True, even more so, for the tripe. It's about as chewy as it can get here. I am not accounting this into the score though, because I think this may be cultural.   Still recommended, just don't expect to be blown away.",

I walked in with my sister one time and saw a couple tables clean and open. We made eye contact with 2 of the waiters, and neither of them offered us a table or even acknowledged our presence. We waited around for about 5 min as they continued to ignore and walk past us several times. Then we just left.  I had high hopes for this place, especially since it's more conveniently located, but I guess I'll just have to continue going down to Spring Mountain to get my pho fix.",

Jenni Pho is the nicest and cleanest Pho restaurant I've ever been to.  From appearance, the owners have done a great job of separating themselves from your prototypical Pho restaurants.  The service here is pretty standard though.  Broken english, unfriendly, etc.  It's tough to describe, but there is a certain air here that I haven't experienced at any other restaurant.  Almost as if the hostess and waiters didn't care about their patrons.  This is very surprising considering they had a more staff then customers (with most of the staff just standing and joking around between themselves).  As for the food? Meh.  We ordered egg rolls as appetizers and Pho as our entrees.  The egg rolls themselves were small, light in filling, with a thick friend wonton wrapper.  It tasted like fried dough.  We didn't even finish all of them and that never happens.  The Pho itself was decent.  I ordered a custom bowl with flank, brisket, and beef.  The broth was a little oily for my taste and the size of the bowl and quantity of the noodles was small.  Mind you, they only serve one size here.  For 8.50 a bowl, I expected more from the Pho.  I guess they charge a premium given the decor... which I must say was their saving grace in my rating.",

    "text": "Lately, the weather in Las Vegas has been so chilly :-/  If the weather gets really cold, I'm always craving for some good Pho. Well, I couldn't stop thinking about it all day at work so I had to grab a bowl of Pho the other day @Jenni Pho. I am the least picky eater out there, in all honesty, although I can't have something too salty particularly. The only thing I won't eat now is black licorice, haha.  Anyways, what's the secret recipe for good Pho?? The broth( the beef bone) or the sack of magical herbs in the broth? I once read, in a Vietnamese food cook book that mentioned the beef bone and its relations to the period and temperature that it is cook. I guess, It takes good amount of time to make a good Pho :) I am pretty sure that only Vietnamese mom of generations can cook the best Pho.  I usually get  'Pho Tai Nam (steak& Flank)-$6.25'. They always give enough beef and a good temperature of the broth. Their broth has a nice, deep flavor and tastes very clean in spite of its cloudy appearance. I usually put a lot of bean sprouts(always very fresh), Thai basil leaves, little bit of jalapeno pepper slices, & a lime wedge. Just having a simple Pho, I like being able to customize it to my tastes; It is a fun moment of all! :P And I always kindly ask a server to bring me a small side dish of sliced onions...As soon as she puts the sliced onion on my table, I like to lightly sprinkle the red hot chilly paste on top of the onions. This is my way to enjoy my Pho ( I can't have a bowl of Pho with kimchi, right? :P). I was very happy that my Pho is accompanied by a plate heaped high with instant onion pickle that I created :)  At the end, I always kill the soup..,leaving the bowl empty..   Overall, Jenni Pho is a clean, has a good size of  parking lot (no hassle), & a good Vietnamese restaurant that is a great addition to the southwest area. Perhaps my complaints will be the slow service that often you get, as the restaurant can be relatively busy at night with a lot of customers.",

So, one Sunday after feeling sick the night before and craving soup that morning, my sister and I were driving by again and decided to stop for pho.  CASH ONLY.  (But they do have an ATM machine, if you don't mind the fee.)  Service was a bit slow, but the guy who welcomed us in and served us was friendly, plus he was even in costume since it was Halloween morning.  We each order our own pho bowls and boba drinks.  The boba was not that great, tasted watered-down and nothing special.  Save your $3 and make the trip to Chinatown area for the good stuff.  As for the pho, I thought it was good...the broth was tasty, the noodles were just right, and the portion of meats was satisfying.  I had the \"Jenni Pho\" house combo, so it was a mix of stuff.  Considering that I'm not really a big fan of pho to begin with, I was happy with what I had at this place.  I give it up to Jennifer (according to the menu, that's really the owner's name) and would definitely go back if I was having another craving for pho!",

I come here because of convenience when the hubbs wants curry across the way and I want something else. This might be the last time I come here.  25 minutes for one entree to go and there's only 2 tables with customers. The viet coffee was warm and needed more ice, when I asked the waitress/cashier named Sophia (according to the receipt,) she looked annoyed and walked away.  Serving food and preparing food isn't hard. I was a waitress in almost every type of restaurant and cafe.",

We came here last night 30 minutes before they closed.  I wasn't expecting so much because of all the awful reviews with slow service and the food is bland.  Especially really bad reviews of people coming close to closing too.    There were two lady servers, they were working, cleaning for the closing.  There were about 7-8 seated tables when we came in.  Two more came in a little after us.  They didn't rush us on ordering and it was easy and quick to flag them down to order.  They came the Asian server came by to refill our water 3 times.  That's a new thing at Asian restaurants for us.  In California, good luck with that one.  LOL, you would ask 2-3 times before you would get it and they give you the dirty look.  We both ordered Pho Dac Biet, $8.95.  The broth is quite nice, flavorful.  You can taste the rich beef, beef bones that's in the broth.  It's no comparison to Pho in California, but it's one of the best in Las Vegas in my opinion.  Overall, we enjoyed the pho and the service was good, not as bad as people claim it to be.  You must keep in mind about service, Asian restaurants aren't like American restaurants.  Elderly Asian family don't tip like this generation does.  The servers don't know or think that they're supposed to hustle to make the extra tip like in the American restaurants or the higher end Asian restaurants.  Mom and pop Asian restaurant are usually the same in service given.  You can always tip them in the beginning and I'm sure they will serve you the way you want them too.  [  Just a thought. =D  ]  I'm happy it's one of the closer Pho spots to our home.",

But I believe the broth is good enough on its own. I'm a simple kind of girl so I just go for the regular Pho Tai (rare steak).   I would give this place 5 stars but I wish they had different sizes to offer, for example, small v large. AND I wish they didn't have a $ limit on using a credit card here (I believe it's $15). But that's better than their old policy of no credit cards at all and cash only.   Employees were prompt and friendly :)",

    "text": "Jennie Pho is located in a free standing restaurant in front of a strip mall on Rainbow Boulevard just north of Windmill Drive.   After a long day of moving we decided to start trying some of the places in our new neighborhood that we've never tried before. I had a combo platter that consisted of a moist and tender grilled pork chop. That pork chop was so freakin tender that I was able to take the first few bites by cutting off pieces with the side of my fork! Also included was 3 large shrimp a fried egg, and a sizable portion of rice!  I haven't tried the pho yet but my friends weren't overly impressed. They both ordered the Jenni Special. They noted that it was okay but that they have had much better at other places in town(including several places in Chinatown and the Lemongrass Cafe on Eastern Ave.). I am quite sure I will be back to try it myself and at that time I'll be able to update this review regarding their pho.   The service was quick and friendly, but then again the place was pretty dead when we went in there yesterday afternoon.   I guess the biggest complaint I had about my experience yesterday was that we were ambushed by a couple of very aggressive gnats/flies. Very freaking annoying when you're trying to eat!  Be aware that they only accept cash. They also have an ATM inside for your money gouging convenience.  I did like this place enough to the point that I will return and try more things. It does have the potential to bump up to 4 stars and it's so close to the house that it would be great to make this a regular spot.  Until further notice though...it will be..  3 stars.",

Great texture and a little slip instead of some dryer ones I've had before. The pork and shrimp were grilled perfectly with the right amount of seasoning. Veggies were refreshing and crisp. I live on the other side of town and I would drive back here just for their vermicelli. Looking forward to trying their pho and other dishes.

    "text": "I have been going to Jenni Pho for at least a year now and find them them really consistent as far as prompt and efficient service, delicious food, and clean/ attractive ambience. There's another Vietnamese joint down the street from them and I feel bad for them because Jenni Pho hits them out of the ballpark as far as flavor and just, well, being so much more NICE inside!  I can highly recommend the beef balls (in the Pho), delicious strips of tendon, tender brisket, and I personally find the broth tasty, with hints of the requisite clove and spices, and not at all \"too salty\" as can be the case with other Pho places who try to extend their soup's taste with salt. I especially love their broken rice dish with spring roll, \"skewer\" pork (meltingly tender marinaded sweet pork) and grilled shrimp. I wish there was a little more shrimp and pork, but it works. It comes with their nuoc cham and some cucumber/ tomato to cleanse the palate.  The fried spring rolls are always hot and savory, with fresh and crisp lettuce and nuoc cham on the side. Any rice dish I've had always wins, though if you like pork, stick to the \"skewer\" pork, not the pork chop- I found the pork chop a bit tough and definitely not as flavorful as the other kind.  Boba in the boba drinks are comparable to any boba joint in Chinatown (staying soft and chewy) and for under $2, their milk-tea boba is a popular and ubiquitious choice.  They are very willing to \"go easy on the ice\" if you tell them to- making the drink that much more \"bang for your buck\" and tasty!  My only gripe is that they only take cash, and while they offer an ATM machine in the corner to address card-only customers (like myself), it still charges you X amount to use it. I'd say, come prepared with your paper stack if you intend to eat here!  Other than that, I love coming to this place and it never disappoints. Even their lunchtime service, full of customers, is reasonably fast. Definitely a neighbourhood favorite and a place I'll keep returning to.",

(Okay, maybe it was a coincidence but I got a kick out of it.  Then again I am easily amused.)  Pros: modern decor, reasonable prices, really good food (especially the pho), only good Vietnamese restaurant on that side of town, very friendly and accommodating staff  Cons: parking is tight, cash only, service can be slow  The pho is huge, has tasty broth, and lots of tender meat.  My only other favorite place is Pho Kim Long in China Town but Jenni Pho has won me over.",

I ordered pho with chicken. The broth wasn't bad but I ended up just eating the noodles and some broth. The chicken was just plain nasty. It seemed like it was just the left over crap from the chicken. The pieces were really grisly and tough. Did not enjoy it at all. Oh and they don't take credit cards. WTF? What business doesn't take credit cards?? They have an ATM in the restaurant. I ended up paying the fee from the ATM and got charged another fee from my bank. Yeah. Not going back. Ever.",

The difference is that Jenni Pho actually doesn't give cilantro in their pho unless you ask for it. It's actually good that they don't considering the amount of people who don't like cilantro. I had to ask for some on the side.   You know that saying that the dirtiest pho tastes the best? When you know their thumb has been dipped in the soup it gives it it's full flavor? Well of course it's just a joke, but point being, Jenni Pho's pho actually tastes really clean compared to Pho Kim Long and Pho So 1. So, I guess the dirtiest pho isn't the best, but in the end it's up to you to decide. If you do want cleaner tasting pho, or fresher tasting, definitely try this place out. Other than that, it's a pretty standard Vietnamese pho restaurant.   My #justeatit rating: whenI'monacleanseoradetox  #justeatitgirl",

I just can't get over their broths and how it's so tasty and refreshing until the very last drop. Sure, it may be more on the oily side but that's ok, I always ask for an extra bowl and carefully spoon out the liquid layers of fat.  The service is quite good; ample amount of waiters and waitresses hanging around ready to help you with whatever.   My only gripe about this place is that they don't accept cards! Debit or credit, doesn't matter. I think everyone will agree that in this day and age that's pretty unacceptable. They have an ATM but still, it takes an X amount of money for the transaction. I actually told them I'll stop by a BoA and come back. Luckily there's one not too far away. However, damage has been done, one demerit for you, jenni; Upgrade your cash registers!  Regardless, this place has awesome pho.",

After being seated, I called the waitress to take my order. Yet, the only two waitresses ignored me. One waitress only cared about cleaning tables and the floor while the other one just kept on telling the people waiting to sign in their names. I waited for 15 minutes and they didn't even serve me a water, so I left the restaurant. I had a terrible experience here because of their service here.",

Then for a while they were taking credit cards but with a $15 minimum, which of course is more than the cost of a meal. Now they take credit cards with no minimum!  Really good pho here. The broth is great; my heart breaks a little every time I see someone dump hoisin and sriracha into their bowl. You're ruining the broth! Those are for dipping!  The beef stew is great, too. I haven't tried the bun bo hue here, but I will order it with confidence if I'm craving it when I visit.  As a unique item, they also have a lobster pho. It's not the crazy whole, fresh lobster in the bowl like you'll get at District One, but for that you'll pay like sixty bucks. This is a lobster tail, and it's only $15 and comes with a free iced tea. I tried it once and enjoyed it a lot.  One problem: one night at around 9 I saw one of the women going around to the tables, topping off the condiment bottles. Not good! How old is some of the sauce in those bottles?? As old as the restaurant?! This isn't just icky, it's a health code violation.  That aside, even with all the good pho places in this neighborhood, Jenni deserves a spot on the pho rotation.",

Upon walking in, the staff at the counter greeted us and seated us immediately. You can tell this place is a homey place because of the way the employees interact with their customers. I was indecisive between the pho dac biet (basically the pho special with everything in it) or the bun bo hue (a special blend of spices to create an extremely savory soup) and decided to try their bun bo hue.   What I liked about it was the flavor of the soup- nice, rich and flavorful. It kind of reminds me of a bit of lemongrass with pork broth and a few other spices that I can't quite put my finger on. The bowl was large with a lot of noodles, a pork hock, Vietnamese meat loaf slices, slices of meat and slices of coagulated pork blood. I know, I know, it sounds gross but honestly, don't knock it till you try it. It tastes good especially with all the fresh crunchy veggies added to the soup to add a different level of texture. What I wish was a bit better was the depth of flavor- I feel like the soup was delicious but it could have been kicked up a notch a bit more.   My honey got the honey chicken with broken rice and it was yummy as well. It was char grilled chicken with fresh green onions on top of it and a heaping pile of broken rice with slices of fresh crisp cucumbers, tomato and carrots.  All in all, I am definitely coming back here to try more of their foods because it was delicious and it definitely hit the spot!",

We were seated right away & they also took our drink orders right away.    We all ordered the Jenni Pho which included all of the various types of meat.  My favorite is brisket and tendon. Yum!! They also have a kids pho which comes with coke or sprite.  It was weird though that the adults got the food before the kids.  I just believe it should be the other way around? Anyways, the broth had flavor and wasnt watered down or anything and was great.  The pho came with a big plate of veggies to accompany your soup.  I was sad that there was no culantro which is the first time ever in a pho restaurant not having it.    Other than that, service was good & food was good! The price also was reasonable and we had a pleasent experience.",

Delicious and savory. The pho I ordered was so delectable I  sat for a moment to appreciate the flavor blend. The soup wasn't salty, and the the noodles were soft. The shrimp tasted clean. I dislike when shrimp has a shady taste at some pho spots. If you spend more than twenty dollars, you get complimentary ice cream! The service was on point as well! This is my favorite pho spot in Vegas.  Pros: great service, clean utensils, clean tables, restrooms, new menu, easy parking, inexpensive, no wait time for seats, apple pay  Cons: no wifi  Overall: Still my favorite pho spot in the city!",

We typically live in Vegas during the winter months and dine at Jenni's often. We love the buy 2 get 1 on the Boba teas, for that boba on the go. I always get the P10 (Gna Pho) with white meat chicken. I absolutely love the flavor of the chicken and broth and the freshness of the pho toppings. My husband always gets one of the rice plates, today he got the grilled BBQ pork skewer and shrimp rice plate (c13). The portions at Jenni Pho are great for the price. The service is always great and everyone is always friendly. It is a little off the beaten path for a tourist, but if you're in the area, you will not be disappointed with stopping at Jenni Pho!

I thought it was an okay experience, the place is clean but unfortunately it was not as good as I had hoped for like the other 2 places that I love going. I got an appetizer and a combination pho, the broth was a little too bland for my taste and the bean sprouts that was brought to me was kinda old, it was on the brown side not like most places where it would still be white. The service was mediocre, could've been more attentive knowing that it was a really slow night. I asked for wooden chopsticks because I'm not into reusable ones but that's just me being nit picky. I get it cost is important. When it comes to a good pho place I need to have the right chili oil on the side if not then it won't be as great for me. They didn't have that apparently. I was in a rush so I asked for my bill right away because I didn't wanna have to wait or flag the servers down to get it after eating but assumed I was done and started bussing my table before I could finish without even asking me if I was all through when clearly I still had a lot on my bowl. Anyway that's just basic fundamentals of serving, don't assume but ask first please. The egg rolls were bomb tho!!",

If you order pot stickers on a sit-down order, they give you a double order at no extra cost.

They were constantly filling our waters and making sure everything was good. However, half way eating my friend noticed a small piece of hair on this egg roll.  We told the server what happened but since we didn't care for the egg roll we just wanted her to know.  I instantly lost all appetite because I couldn't get over the hair!

The pearls for the boba tea were undercooked and hard. The pho noodles were overcooked and a bit mushy but the broth had a pretty good flavor and the Jenni Pho had lots of meat. I did love how they didn't skimp on the fresh veggies and herbs for the pho and egg rolls. Fresh romaine lettuce, mint leaves, basil and bean sprouts. Their fish sauce for the egg rolls was very plain though. I had to add some chili garlic sauce and lemon to it to give it the right flavor.   Overall it was okay. With so many other good options in Vegas though, I don't know if I'd go back. Plus it seemed pretty pricey. $22 for pho, egg rolls and a regular boba? I don't know about that.",

    "text": "Our family is an original owner within the nearby Nevada Trails tract. I remember when Jenni Pho first opened--when the shopping center, housing it, was built. So why wait until now to write a review?   Back then, I figured Jenni Pho wasn't a \"destination\" and would only be of interest to residents in the vicinity. But in the past 14 years, the area has developed more residential and commercial--and other Vietnamese restaurants have opened nearby.   One of the nice things about Jenni Pho is the physical layout. Jenni Pho is within a freestanding building. It occupies its own \"pad\"--not a \"shoebox\" unit within a strip mall. This means that they have a lot more window area, and more natural light. It also allows them to have an \"open kitchen\". (Frankly, there isn't much to see inside the kitchen--but it requires them to maintain \"good optics\" for public viewing.) The decor isn't fancy, but it is nice; the colors are neutral and relaxing.  The seating isn't plush, but it is comfortable.   Frankly, I haven't eaten anything on the menu other than bowls of pho. But this is probably the most frequently ordered meal.   Through the years, I have found the food quality to be consistent. Meal portions are good, relative to the price. But what I appreciate most is the soup. One of my personal peeves is that many pho shops provide broth that is either too salty, too sweet, or both. The broth provided by Jenni Pho is just right--such that I can actually drink the soup as well as eat the noodles.   It's nice to have a number of Vietnamese restaurants nearby, for variety. But it's also nice to understand why I tend to frequent Jenni Pho more often than the others.",

I've been to Jenni Pho 4 times and it has always given me my Pho fix.    It's all about the soup base when it comes to pho. Soup is savory (authentic and good ingredients) and not overly salty (MSG) tasting.  I've had the opportunity to try 3 types of noodles on my visit, Pho Dat Biet, Bun Bo Hue, and Bun Riue.  All very tasty and more importantly very authentic.",

But it is actually good enough to go to because it's the closest place to go to for Pho without the far drive to China town.    The soup here is kind of bland but there is actually enough taste to make you come back on a rainy day.  It's actually a plus if you're looking for low sodium I guess.  There isn't much to the broth and you definitely have to dip all your meat in some kind of sauce before you eat it.  The fried egg rolls are good though and they come with lettuce to wrap it in.  If you want good authentic Pho, I suggest making the drive out.  But if you're super hungry and you're OK with good soup that you don't have to make yourself, go to Jenni Pho.",

I've been there where the ginger flavor was much too strong but I've also been there where they've had a perfect broth.   The prices are reasonable and I never have to wait.

    "text": "Vietnamese food remains a novelty in the southwest area of Las Vegas.  With the recent opening of Jenni Pho, it satisfies your basic pho desires.  Jenni Pho is a clean restaurant with an open kitchen viewable through the glass window, something you don't see often in Vietnamese establishments.  Their menu is quite limited (versus others), focusing on a handful of pho bowls, broken rice dishes, stir fried noodles, and cold noodle bowls.  They also offer boba and slushed ice drinks.  And yes, it's a bit more expensive than Spring Mountain restaurants.  I've been here a few times, sticking to the pho dishes.  Most recently I ordered the \"Create Your Own Bowl\" for $6.95.  You can choose  up to five items among 8 for your own combo.  I went for the fatty flank, steak, meat balls, crunchy flank, and tripe.  (The other three are brisket, tendon, and flank.)  They only have one size available, which is a cross between the small and large in other restaurants.   The Husband ordered the Bo Kho (Beef Stew Noodle Soup) for $7.50.  He asked for egg noodles, which costs a dollar more.  When we actually got the bowl, regular rice noodles were there.  We told the waitress and she offered to take it back and change out the noodles but we were hungry and didn't want to wait.  We just wanted to be sure we weren't charged for the noodle change that didn't happen.  They do offer a decent amount of noodles and meat in their version.    Overall, Jenni Pho has had a steady stream of customers when we visit.  And we notice non-Vietnamese frequenting as well, which I account for their picture menu making lives a bit easier.  It's a bit more relaxed here though, like a leisurely meal taking place.  It works when you're craving basic Vietnamese food in the area.  Cash only.  (Pics posted!)",

We had the egg rolls which were served piping hot and extra, tasty, crispy.  They were accompanied by fresh cilantro and plenty of fresh green leaf lettuce for wrapping.    Jenni Pho is nice because they offer chili paste and chili oil in the condiment tray.  The restaurant is cute and very clean and tidy.  The service is friendlier than most.    Vietnamese coffee was pleasing as ever -  a super strong, super sweet zing to start your day!  We were craving pho early and were so pleased to find out they opened at 9:30 am! What a breakfast treat!  The broth was very nicely flavored, and the portion was more than adequate. Everyone was pleased with the meal! Warm happy bellies make a great start to any day.  2 Vietnamese coffees, 1 coke, 1 hot tea, 1 coconut water, 4 bowls of pho and 2 orders of egg rolls = $53.",

The pot stickers were good and I don't like them usually,  salad rolls respectful and the dipping sauce surprisingly generous in proportion *the pb sauce you get. At the end of the meal,  I gave my debit card and I was told they didn't take debit but to use their atm  machine...and of course there is a charge and the owner makes more money off of an unaware customers,   not cool number 2. I still tipped generously since the young wait staff have to work with that poor excuse of an owner. As we were leaving, I think his wife said, 'see you soon' My reply, 'not that soon'. Too many places here in Vegas to eat pho, just drive up Spring Mt. Rd. Pho 87 is very tasty.",

I do feel like they should credit you what you have to pay in ATM fees because it doesn't seem fair to have to pay a few extra dollars just because the business is stuck in a time warp and doesn't accept credit/debit. But if you have cash, you'll be happy with the food here.",

I think I'm in love.    -Her name is JenniPho and she's from Vegas.   -She took good care of me when I was there.  -She plays modern rock from the 80's. -She dresses nicely with neutral colors and rattan furnishings.    -She's clean.  She even has a large window so I can see how clean her kitchen is and what she does in it.   -Her broth is excellent in her Pho Dat Biet (combo).  Even her beef balls impressed me!  With wonderful flavor and texture, it's evident that she uses fresh and high quality ingredients.  Too bad she doesn't offer a bigger bowl! -Her eggroll wasn't bad, and her grilled honey chicken was nice and gingery. -Oh, and she only takes cash!  I have to see her every time I visit the desert!",

There is an amazing young waiter here too, forgot his name (sorry)...but he always takes care of us and is really cordial. Yesterday instead if coconut water we got the green apple iced tea and Papaya milk tea! Both were so good! Must try if you're into those kinds of drinks :)  only sad thing is they only accept cash!

What turns me off about this place is that it's cash only. It reminded me of another pho place I went to that had no sign that there was a debit card minimum. Since I had no cash, they pointed me to an ATM onsite that charged a fee and was owned by the restaurant. How convenient. Do all Pho places run like this?",

Its a small establishment between Spring Valley and Enterprise. They have the most flavorsome broths in town. They set you up with separate sides so you can decide what you would like to add to your soup. I got the shrimp pho and oh my taste buds. There was so much warmness and deliciousness in that big bowl of pho. I couldn't help but finish the entire bowl. I definitely need to get back here during winter time when its extremely cold. My friends also tried the grilled honey chicken which her boys enjoyed. My kid ordered the chicken strips which she liked a lot.",

Everything was clean & you can see into the kitchen clearly.  Friends last minute b-day Pho request.  Ordered the Tofu, Pork & the Shrimp Spring Rolls since we have Vegan friends too & Jenni Pho was very accommodating.  All of the veggies & shrimp were fresh & a nice lite way to start before our filling Pho.  The pork tasted & looked more like a Spam Spring Roll to me, & recommend the delicious Tofu Spring Roll over it!  One Vegan Pho w/ Tomato broth, different & very tasty!  The Beef Pho & Chicken Pho were surprisingly delish to me because I have become a 'Pho snob.'  Lol!  I usually eat at two Pho spots regularly that no other compare to.  My white meat chicken was tender, but needed a couple more pieces even though it's a large portion of Pho.  The side veggies of basil, sprouts, jalapeno, lime, etc were fresh & abundant.  All sauces & chopsticks already on the table, not the soup spoons.    Not big on Boba drinks since they are also filling before Pho & I don't eat the tapioca balls, but I like the authenticity having them here if I do want one, usually on a hot day.    They do not serve alcoholic beverages or sparkling water.",

We both come here every once in a while to satisfy our vietnamese food cravings, and it doesn't disappoint.  2 meals, more than enough to satisfy with the portions. $21. Not bad.  SERVICE: The staff is very courteous and friendly. They forgot our bean sprouts platter for our Pho, and special soup spoon for the broth. We let the staff know, and they apologized and quickly gave us what we needed. One of the staff (I'm not sure if she's the manager, but looks to be) even gave me a small bowl of broth to enjoy alongside with my rice platter as a way to say sorry for the mistakes. I gladly accepted. The broth was great, and I appreciate the gesture!   It's fine to forget small things, as long as they quickly resolve them. Very friendly! Leave a tip for them. Kept our water cups filled.  VERIDICT: There is probably a place with better cuisine, especially in a place like Las Vegas. But if you are anywhere near the South side, this place doesn't disappoint. Good food, and friendly staff. If you're near, give it a try.",

I also liked that the restaurant was clean and organized. would love to come again (-:",

Some of our group were fiending for pho and this location was in extremely efficient proximity, so we ventured forth. Once seated, we got our rounds of icy cold water and debated over our orders. I opted for their beef special, which included various bits of beefy goodness including tendon, brisket and tripe. I ordered their blood cubes as an addition, which were surprisingly large once they arrived. I also ordered the green papaya salad for the table, which was alright. The salad included beef jerky, which was an interesting touch, though the dressing wasn't particularly noteworthy and a bit overly sweet for my tastes. The pho broth was alright, perhaps not as deep or nuanced as other places I've tried, and they brought ONE small plate of herbs for a table of five (and THREE of us had ordered pho). As soon as we finished and began filtering out, an older woman who worked there sat at our table and stared us down, making me rather uncomfortable.   Pros: convenient location for the area   Cons: creepy lady, lack of herbaceous goodness, underwelming salad, slightly elevated prices compared to other locations",

    "text": "My wife saw a huge billboard for Jenni Pho.  She looked it up on google and we were off on our next lunch-scapade.    Funny thing, she chose the WRONG Jenni Pho.  There are two:  one at Rainbow and a new one at Spring Mountain.  Since we were at the Wynn, it would have been convenient to just swing by the new location; instead, we hiked out to Rainbow.  And, what a hike it is.  Jenni Pho is located in a compact complex.  Parking is atrocious! And, people in Vegas fail to drive within the rules.  One way means one way and not two way.  Once you see the lot, you will understand.  Restaurant is not that bad.  It is a bit tight walking in and there is very little room.  It seemed like they try to squeeze as many tables together as they can.  Also, to save on electricity, they left the front door open.  So, people sitting next to the front door had to suffer a noticeable cold breeze.  Note:  Since this is during the winter months, this is not good.   My wife and I both tried the Pho Dac Biet.  We have tasted better.  It lacked a lot of flavor.  It was kinda water down.  However, I think it was a new brew and it actually needed to \"sit\" (like 24 hours) for awhile before being served.  Also, the water was not hot or warm.  I think the noodles were cold and they put the brew on top.  The noodles cooled down the water and it made the meal less appealing.    Service was decent here.  Unlike many Viet establishments, service was very attentive and they were very nice.    Overall, I thought the service was good, price was \"higher\" compared to other vietnamese restaurant (not too much, but enough to notice), and food was below average on this occasion.  We still plan to give this another try.  Next time, we probably try the Spring Mountain location.  Cheers,",

Yes, I realize I could possibly be the only person who doesn't like pho, as it seems everyone else in the world loves it.  Anyhoozles...  My friend talked me into having lunch here because she likes their cold noodles.  I can't think of the name on the menu, but it's basically cold noodles similar to somen noodles, with lettuce, carrots and I got the one with egg rolls.  It was just OKAY.    However, I took my leftovers to go and ate it two days later, and it tasted WAY better than when I was eating there.  I think because the sauce had time to actually soak into the noodles so it had more flavor.  The thai iced tea boba was pretty good and there was a buy 2 get one free deal.    I probably wouldn't eat here again unless my friend dragged me back kicking and screaming. :(",

    "text": "Vegas has a lot of options for Vietnamese food and I don't have a favorite (yet) but I love Jenni Pho because it's a little bit closer for me than Spring Mountain and it's always good.  I have tried their pho (I always do the build your own so I can pick the meats) and it is pretty solid.   Their rice plates are also a great choice especially for non-pho lovers. The grilled pork and short ribs are my favorite.  They also have other noodle options, beef stew, and oxtail pho (I still need to try).   The restaurant is very clean and the kitchen is visible from the dining room. Service is very friendly and attentive.   Tip: Jenni Pho also has 3 value bentos to choose from and for about 10 bucks my favorite is \"Option B\" where you can get rice, grilled pork, fried chicken wings, an egg roll, a cup of their delicious broth, and a drink (soda or boba).  Definitely an excellent option for Vietnamese food outside of Spring Mountain.",

It's cool cause they have clear glass between the kitchen and the dining area, so you can see the chefs at work.  The server was also reeeaaally nice and attentive.  I was recently recommended the oxtail pho that they recently added to their menu (which I had no idea existed as an option for pho). And I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was!  Ya'll should definitely come and give the place a try.  & I'm not that good at photos but maybe the lighting in the restaurant was just really good or something, idk.  Go and take your selfies .",

I myself got one of the combination dishes, it consisted of grilled skewer pork, grilled shrimp, egg rolls, and brown rice, 10/10 for the quality and wow they cook fast!  I was also surprised to find thai iced tea on the menu which is a plus for me because I'm always in the mood for it!

    "text": "Introduction:  It's a super cold night so I crave a bowl of Pho.  Ran into Jenni Pho and decided to give it a shot. Man, am I glad I gave it a shot. Here's why........  Customer Service: 5/5 Super friendly waitresses, from the moment you walk in till the time we left the restaurant.   Quality: 5/5 One word, YUMMY! We had the Pho Bento plate and the BBQ pork and egg roll vermicelli.  Both, were equally amazing.  One of the best fish sauce I've ever had (not so fishy) & also, the best egg rolls.    The egg rolls were super crunchy and doesn't have a funky smell to them, like some of the ones I had at other Pho restaurants.   Quantity: 5/5 I had the Bento plate, which comes with a bowl of  Pho, a side of BBQ pork, 2 pieces of fried wontons, an egg roll (I ate it all, felt like a pig) and ice cream.    My friend had the BBQ pork and egg roll vermicelli bowl.  Both orders had amazing portions, but we ate them all cause they were exceptional.  Price: 5/5 The Bento was only $12.99, as you can see, what comes with it as I mentioned above for only $12.99 is OUTSTANDING.  Cleanliness: 5/5 Unlike some typical Pho restaurants, this place was immaculate.  Atmosphere: 5/5 Super cozy, comforting and accommodating. Makes you feel really welcome as a customer. Sorry to say, but for an Asian restaurant, it's rare.  Tips: I love Jenni Pho, our new Pho place to go. We will definitely be back. Everything on the menu was super inexpensive.",

Parents get the Super size traditional Jenni pho to share with. Broth was fresh, hot and flavorful. They charged $1 for extra broth. Service were excellent and friendly staffs.

Very tender  - Broth is flavorful, a tad bit oily  - Thai boba tea was delicious!!  - Food came out quick  - Service is extremely friendly!

We ordered our usual order so that we could compare the two places. Springs rolls, charbroiled pork chops, and a beef ball and brisket combo pho.  Each of jenni pho's dishes fell short in taste in comparison to kim long's. Having tasted kim long's food the dishes at jenni's were a little bland. Peanut sauce was runny, spring rolls weren't fresh, vermicelli overcooked. I do give them points for great customer service. They lose points in being a \"cash only\" establishment.",

    "text": "I've heard from friends that Jenni Pho has the best Thai Tea in town. And since its right down the street from my house, its 1000x more convenient than driving all the way to Pho So 1 on Spring Mountain ( my usual pho spot ).   The restaurant is fairly small but well-decorated and well-lit with natural light. Generally speaking, asian food joints aren't the nicest places to eat. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that Jenni Pho is actually a really nice sit down restaurant.   In addition to pho, the menu features a variety of delicious appetizers and entrees for those who aren't pho people. My favorite bowl of pho is Pho Dac Biet which is their \"Jenni Pho\" so I went with that and an order of fresh spring rolls. The spring rolls were absolutely delicious: soft noodles, crisp vegetables, fresh shrimp. Definitely one of the better spring rolls I've had. But the peanut sauce was a little bit thick for my liking. So I added some soy sauce and sriracha to it to tone down the strong peanut flavor and thin the consistency a bit.   The server's timing was very good as well. I was halfway done with my spring rolls and he brought the pho to the table. I was immediately disappointed to see that all of the \"rare beef\" was fully if not over cooked. Next time I'll be ordering the beef on the side; I prefer my beef more rare than well-done. Pho Dac Biet doesn't usually come with meatballs. And nothing against Jenni Pho but I've just never been a big fan of Asian meatballs so I removed those from my bowl. Despite my issues with the meats, I still enjoyed this bowl of pho. The broth was very flavorful and it satisfied my craving.   Before I left, I got a Boba Thai Tea to go. WHICH WAS AWESOME AND CHEAP.  I can see Jenni Pho becoming one of my usual spots to eat. Overall, the pho was just OK. But I did enjoy my meal. And its so close to my home that I just can't pass it up.",

The ambiance here is relaxing and feels a little more \"homey\" and warm versus the second location. You can feel all of the love and effort this family owned business puts into their restaurant as soon as you walk through the door. Their wonderful service is consistent each time we come here. The delicious pho broth never changes and always serves to satisfy our pho expectations. Always order the crab rangoons for appetizer and if you haven't yet, you have to try the bun bo hue! They DO NOT take cash so remember to bring cash if you mind ATM fees. The commotion will be worth it. We love Jennipho!",

    "text": "So Annoyed with this place. I waited a few days to gather my thoughts before I left a review, because I didn't want my frustrations dictate my views. This is the second time I have placed an order (in person) and the second time it was given to me incorrectly. The first time I ordered 3 meals and a few side orders, I didn't bother checking the bag since it seemed so heavy. It was a $40 dollar order mind you-_-. When I arrived at the house, I noticed the third meal was not there and I called. The receipts they give you doesn't have the items ordered, they only have the total amount. Which is even more frustrating because the burden is on me to prove what I ordered matches the price. The lady on the phone basically challenged everything I said and so I just let it go. I didn't have time to argue with her. Fast forward 7 months and figured I give it a try again. I ordered Honey chicken (4 meals total), egg rolls, Taro smoothy and even pointed with my beautiful finger right over the name. The girl taking my order even repeated it back to me and so I paid an almost $70 price tag. I waited for about 20 min and the girl didn't seem too excited to be there, mostly checking her phone and looking around before deciding to make the smoothy. When I get the order I make sure to check everything and what do I see??? A sunny side up egg plopped on top of porkchop and rice. So I begin to question the guy who brought the food and when the girl (who took my order) noticed me questioning things, she came right over and crouched down to eye level while I sat dumbfounded on the chair. She looked right at me and stated...\" You ordered C6 which is a porkchop, don't you remember what you order\"? It took Every ounce of effort to not lose it. Am I not the customer here? Since my debit card had already been charged and I didn't want to end up on the news, so I simply decided to be the bigger person and just leave. With the food of course. Never will I ever go back to this place ever again. The food and hassle is not worth it.",

I ordered \"extra tendon\" but only found one small piece in my entire bowl.    As others have pointed out, they charge for refills on fountain soda which, in my book, is an automatic one-star deduction, and it's cash only - not cool.  Also they have no banh mi bread here, and I enjoy dipping my baguette in the broth...  I probably won't go back here unless I'm feeling too lazy to drive to C-town.  Also, they have a spicy blood dish I may want to try.",

It's nice to see that they have a variety of boba drinks.  My only complaint is that they only take CASH, which is very inconvenient since it is 2010 and no one really carries cash.  It seems to be more convenient for the owner who must enjoy not paying those small fees, especially seeing Jenni's high end luxury car always parked in the front. Just sayin'  Great service from the staff",

Jenni Pho is the BEST Vietnamese restaurant in the SW(because of the quality of the food and the customer service). I love that their dishes always come out hot, fresh, delicious, authentic, and plentiful(the soups come out piping hot :). Everything we've tried is yummy, but their pho, bun rieu(tomato egg soup), and thit nuong (charbroiled/grilled pork) are my family's faves. Service has always been friendly/great. Even when they get really busy, they don't lack service nor give you attitude if you need something. Jenni is very sweet and friendly herself; and you can tell she takes pride in her business (because she's there a lot). No restaurant runs perfectly; but if there's ever any issues, inform them(Jenni)(otherwise they don't know)and they will make it right! The restaurant is very clean, esp the restrooms. I like that they have an open kitchen(that's when you know they have nothing to hide :) ).",

The best thing in this place is the egg rolls, however they do not serve it authentically like the other restaurants in Chinatown.  Where's the pickled carrots and radishes.  Missing mint, the purple leaves and all kinds of herbs.  Best place for that if you really like herbs and veggies you have to go to Pho So 1.  I did stop by this place because my daughter wanted egg rolls and I did not want to do the drive to Chinatown.  It's good once in a while but I like grilled beef that I can wrap with the rice paper and pineapple sauce.  The best place is Pho So 1 for that.",

    "text": "It's a clean, friendly place but I've had better pho in town.  Here's what makes their pho not totally up to par:  * the broth is on the bland side, not flavorful and savory enough. * the rice noodles are placed in the bowls way before you order.  I can tell bc it comes in one giant sticky glob in the soup and it's hard to break apart to eat. * the sliced ribeye is completely cooked in the bowl.  Typically, the meat is placed into your bowl with the boiling hot broth and you can actually see it being cooked by it.  This place has the meat completely well done by the time it arrives at the table.  I suspect they have each portion already cooked separately.",

He checked on me without being intrusive, brought me extra cilantro when I asked, and served me a ready-made Vietnamese iced coffee.

We were promptly seated and the server took our order of 3 Phos and an order of egg rolls. I kid you not it took over 35 minute to get our Pho! WHAT THE PHO!!!!!? And then we asked our waiter about the egg rolls and he told us it would be a couple more minutes. When we were finished with our Pho guess what finally showed up??? We told them we didn't want it anymore so they apologized and took it back!  Then we decided to utilize the boba special they had (buy 2 get 1 free) and so we placed our order with the server.. 5 minutes later he comes back asking what we ordered again because he forgot...!! -___-  IDK I may try giving Jenni Pho another chance since the food was not that bad..and hopefully Jennifer is there next time because I hear everything runs more smoothly when she's present.",

The restaurant is arranged very nicely. You can see the kitchen because part of the wall is glass. I got the combo pho and a mango boba. First of, I thought that it was weird that my drink was served after my pho was served. I honestly think that our server just forgot because I remember asking twice. I don't have any complaints about the pho. I thought it was great and the portion size felt bigger than your average Vietnamese restaurant. Or server also provided us with enough sprouted beans and leaves for three people. The mango boba was also good, however, some of the boba balls were very hard and not exactly chewy. I'm just glad that it wasn't extremely sweet. I'll definitely come back to this place again when I am craving for pho that's close by my house.",

All closely located in the southwest part of town.    Jenni is chinese and is fun hearing them transition between chinese and vietnamese.  That being said, typical asian restaurants have poor service.  It's been hit and miss each time I've been - to the extreme where I've had to ask for water 6 times!  Other times they didn't miss a beat.  I'm not the best to judge for pho.  We like what we like.  Especially when we start adding in other crap like hoisin, siracha and mint leaves.  Their base is good.  Can't compare to Saigon 8 or Pho So 1 but we like what we like.  I do feel bad for their staff as they don't accept credit cards.  They \"conveniently\" have an ATM next to the register.  I can't imagine there's not one day - actually one hour - where someone doesn't complain that they don't accept credit cards and the ATM charges a fee.",

First off bring cash they do not expect plastic! They do have an atm machine in the restaurant, but who knows the fees that it might hold!!!!   Jenni Pho is a small cafe. The service was excellent and the Pho was so yummy. Even better then I expected it to be.  I ordered an appetizer of their Shrimp Rolls which were perfectly cooked. The crispy wonton wrapper was fried just right. It didn't fall all over you on the first bite! For my entree, I ordered the Seafood Pho. It had tons of fish, calamari, and shrimp and the broth was very tasty. I loved all the bean sprouts and other things you get to mix into it. My friend and her husband ordered two appetizers. She got the egg rolls and he got the spring rolls. They let me try the egg roll and OMG I would go back just for that egg roll. The chicken in it was packed in perfectly, not dry, and again did not fall apart on the first bite. For their Pho, she got the Steak and Flank and he got the Seafood Pho like me.  For my first experience with Pho I really enjoyed it. Jenni Pho makes some tasty broth and I loved the amount of seafood they give you as well. I can't wait to take my husband in for the Pho and the egg rolls! Mmmm I wish I could go back right now! lol",

    "text": "I came to this place about 3 times and after the last time, it just dropped a star for me. Here's why in a nutshell:  Food:  Generally if your at a pho restaurant, people tend to order pho, duh. So of course my husband and I ordered pho. Compared to Kim Long where everyone seems to go after a crazy night of clubbing on the strip etc. (must be a reason why). This place lack a bit in its flavor. They lack the genuine beef bones stock flavor in the soup and add too much clove that over powered the soup. This is not the garlic clove I'm talking about but a flower bud herb that is in many Asian cooking. (minus 1-star)  Service: I wasn't too hungry yet and decided to order the kids size which they were nice enough to let me order. The kids pho came with a soda and when I asked for it when my food came, then he tells me \"oh its for kids only\". In my opinion, I am paying for it so why does it matter? Why didn't he tell me before I ordered? If that's they case, I may have just ordered the regular size which the price wasn't much of a difference now that I didn't get my soda. How much would the soda be for them to serve it anyway.  I do have to admit, their service is great. But that whole soda situation was unnecessary to upset your customer and risk losing them. I just didn't like the fact there was no communication that if I ordered it, that I would not get my soda because I wasn't a kid?? If you allowed a customer to order it, then honor it. (Minus 1-star)  Parking: Plenty  Cleanliness:  Very clean and you can see the whole kitchen which is quite clean too, I'll give them that.",

I got Pho Tai this time around because I didn't see the former on the menu (but the staff said they will make it upon request), the pho was good. Not the best I've ever tasted, but my priorities are cleanliness and taste. It passed on both marks.  Just writing this review makes me want to go eat some pho...   The place is very clean, well decorated, and it's pretty cool that the kitchen is transparent (glass encasing).   I recommend, esp. if you're on the SW part of town. Otherwise, it's too far, and I stick to Spring Mtn.",

Not a big deal, but best to mention that they only take cash and the location works for me but just FYI location is SW Vegas and not your typical Chinatown area.  To me that's a plus!",

It also had some type of bones (I, hopefully, assume for flavor) which I didn't know was in the soup, so when I spooned it up and tried to eat it, obviously,  you cannot.  I had to spit it out.  A plate of bean sprouts????????  I didn't think I was ordering vegetarian soup.  My sister ordered another type of soup.  Hers, at least was hot.

It wouldn't be my first chouce Pho place, but I live in the Blue Diamond area, and when I am craving Pho, Jenni Pho is good enough for me!   I think that their Pho with the rare steak and tripe is comparable to other Pho places I have been. Their Bun with pork and shrimp however tastes a bit too charbroiled to me. Not enough marinate. My boyfriend usually orders the charbroiled pork plate with the french rice, which I have tried. The rice is too dry/ cooked (so it had alot of hard rice).. and again, meat is too charded.   All in all, I like Jenni Pho... but it isnt my number one choice",

I noticed that the table next to us got their food a lot faster than us. After getting their attention 10 minutes later, we let Travis our waiter know that we ordered spring rolls and pot stickers. Still waited patiently... Got the pot stickers half way through our meal and asked for a box because we were already full. Not to mention that I still never got my spring rolls. After the meal we let Travis know again that we would like a box for the pot stickers and that we still NEVER got our spring rolls. He immediately said he would cancel our order (that's cool, not like I wanted them or anything. *sarcasm intended) an apology was never said, but he did throw in a $2.00 discount on our entire check.

The noodles were nice and chewy, the beef was good. However the broth needed a little more kick. Service was very attentive and nice. We were just disappointed with the Tendon. The Tendon here is very different from the one you get over at Pho So 1, which is our favorite place in town to go and have Pho.

Very clean place as well.",

    "text": "The restaurant was clean and nice, serivce was good and  that's all the positive comment I could say about this restaurant. The Pho was very bland and basically was full of MSG. My stomach can handle a little MSG, but when there are alot (and I meant alot), I can tell. Bun Bo Hue was horrible. The grill pork combo rice dish was not great either. The price was expensive and they don't take credit cards, cash only. I'm guessing it was probably tax reason. Anyway, quite disappointed since I had such a high hope of finally having a good vietnamese restaurant near my house so I don't have to drive all the way down to Spring Mountain for a good bowl of Pho. Ohh, fine,, maybe I could mentioned one more positive thing about this place, which is \" this place is still better than Pho Hoang a few blocks away.\" I cannot find one good thing about Pho Hoang when I ate there.",

    "text": "I used to go to Jenni's  almost everyday since it's close for my lunch break. but for the last couple of weeks the pho  isn't the same, and I've noticed several of the employees that used to work there (which always greeted me with a smile) aren't working anymore.  Especially the cook, whom always knew what I wanted to order before I ordered it. Now the cook behind the glass adds very little meat to the Pho and always has a very snooty demeanor and is always yelling in the kitchen. I used to love Jenni Pho but I  think  the new employees won't replace the old. :(",

    "text": "My family and I have been loyal customers of Jenni pho since they opened. Just this evening I had dinner with my parents, grandma sister, my 4 year old daughter and 16 month son.  We all ordered are usual soups. But when we were served all the soups were mixed up. Oh well we were all excited to be eating our favorite soup. We were all finishing our food and winding down everyone full and happy. All of a sudden our grandma started being unresponsive we all stood up scared and quickly asked the restaurant for help in calling 911. The person up at register had his back to us not sure if he heard was going on but my dad asked calmly and kindly if we could use there phone to call 911 so that they would know right away our location. The man said \" No use your own cell phone\". Are you ?$!!!@!!! Serious??? None of the staff stopped to ask us if everything was ok. They just kept working like it was no big deal??? It wasn't like this was in the corner not everyone could see us we were sitting in the middle of the restaurant??!!!luckily the table next us were so kind and tried to help us and they called 911 for us. Yes we all had our phones but when your in that moment and you have 2 little ones as well and your thinking your loved one is dieing in front of your eyes you are not thinking straight. Finally after a few min a waiter asked if he could do anything we said yes could you please bring us a wet cloth he came back with only napkins??? Well we finally got my grandma who is on dyalisys  awake and coherent. We tried to leave as quick as we could because we were so appaled at the service we just received. We will no longer be eating @ jenny pho and we will be telling all our friends and family not too as well. Shame on you!!!",

    "text": "with the recent closing of Pho 777, there is a void of Vietnamese joints in the southwest area near blue diamond.  yes, there is Pho Hoang, but i guess what i mean is there is void of decent Vietnamese joints in the southwest area.  one day, after passing by this shopping center on my way to work, i noticed a this new pho restaurant opening.  i couldn't wait when i saw a lit boba sign in the window.  so last monday, my favorite dining companion (actually now my fiancee) decided to check out the restaurant, but as we walked through the UNLOCKED door, our hungry stomachs were punched when we found out that they were not opening until the next day on 11/4.  Well, I didn't make it to the grand opening, but i made it there today along with two curious coworkers.  as soon as we walked it, we noticed at how busy it was.  also, we noticed that you can peer into the kitchen whenever you want because there is no wall.  its a gigantic window.  its like going to the giant aquarium at the silverton lodge but instead of fish and and fake-topless mermaids, you see a bunch of people cooking and preparing your meals.  no shady business with your food here.   the menu was quite simple and not as extensive as other Vietnamese restaurants, but  they had your typical pho dishes ~$7, my favorite beef stew dish, vermicelli dishes, and rice dishes, too.  the only way to eat pho is to get the #1, which consisted of thin slippery rice noodles, thin slices of rare steak, well-done flank, extra fatty briskets, gooey gelatin soft tendon, and strings of tripe in a flavorful broth that hummed of star anise.  i love how not only do you have the typical hoisin, and red chili sauce, but they also give you the crunchy and oily red pepper to add some heat and flavorful zing to my pho.   im disappointed but they didnt have the option to get a bigger pho bowl, but my tummy was warm and full after slurping up this entire soup bowl.  service still seems to be learning the ropes.  they did forget our water and utensils.   i also have to add one more thing, when i ordered for Vietnamese iced coffee on the menu, i was told that they didnt have any today, but they did have tea.  WHAT????  that's equivalent to going to the golden arches, and not able to order and cold and sugary icey coca-cola to wash my big mac down.   above all....minus the coffee and the service, this restaurant has a lot going for it, compared to the earlier mentioned pho houses on this side of town, my ass will be plopped here a lot more often after that tasty bowl of pho",
