Coupons for buy one get one free drinks floated around to all the tables and our waitress was very attentive. We both got tacos, Charlies tacos and chicken tacos would recommend both although Charlies tacos had a little more spice and flavor to them. Great prices for a quick bite don't expect to be waited on hand and foot it's a casual more bar atmosphere. All in all would recommend and if staying at flamingo again, would come back to for a nice quick lunch. I'm giving this place 4 stars, for what it was it was good, not the very best I've ever had but I would recommend if you're walking around the flamingo and want a bite.",

    "text": "Had one of the worse experiences a restaurant ever. My hubby & i went after a long day of being on the road and checking in at the hotel...we decided to come here, without Yelping first. First, mistake. The service was very poor for the restaurant being practically empty when we were there. We finally ordered, got nachos since we thought it was the safest item on the menu.  they were decent. A quarter way into eating them, we spot a cockroach on the wall of our table. We freaked and wanted to leave asap. We told our waitress, who proceed to inform her manager. The manager came over to speak to us and apologized, she comp our meal but at that point we just wanted to leave. which did the minute we gathered our things.  We should have Yelp first.  Sad part was we were still hungry. Later in the night, this location plays loud music you can hear up to 21st floor at the Flamingo hotel. Not cool if you are trying to go to sleep, the hotel can't do anything about it since it's an indepedent business fromt he hotel. Ugh, just added more fuel to the fire to dislike this place. Although, they handle the situation according, it didn't make it any better.",

I told the bartender the last time I paid that much for a beer was when I was drinking a craft beer. It was a Ballast Point Sculpin to be exact. Then I asked him why this bar does not offer more selection than Coors, Budweiser, Corona and Dos Equis and he said most people prefer these beers. Really? The only reason they prefer these beers is due to the lack of selection at this place and other places on The Strip. I told him he should offer craft beer to differentiate this place from other places. Apparently he was not open to the suggestion. With that attitude and way of thinking,  I will be shocked if this bar is still around when I return to Vegas. Adios Carlos' n Charlie's.",

I don't recall the food being the low quality we had in this visit.  We were hungry for Mexican food;  So decided on C&C for lunch while at the Flamingo.  I had Charlie's tacos.  The meat was flavorful. Only reason this review isn't one star.  My daughter had the chicken enchiladas. There was almost no sauce on them;  and there was a sprinkling of peas. PEAS?? On chicken enchiladas?  She said the beans and rice were flavorless. Hubby had the carne asada burrito. He said it was okay.  He also said the beans/rice were flavorless.  We were not served chips and salsa. At the extremely high prices;  There should at least be chips and salsa.  Hubby's Grey Goose martini was tiny and he said it didn't tasty like Grey Goose.  Certainly didn't look anything like the GG martinis we usually drink.",

So the tortillas had crusty hard edges in which we got to put our barley warm chicken.,  Really bad.  Also the margaritas (not frozen) obviously made with a mix sickening sweet no alcohol you needed alcohol to get through this meal.  How can you have a Mexican restaurant and not provide complementary chips and salsa.. This should not be an add on item.  I am local and my husband and I have a date night on the strip every Saturday  Most restaurants in the tourist corridor are good ... sometimes over priced.. but this was the most atrocious dining experience ever,  it was just supposed to be a quick Mexican meal and go home  it was a bummer for sure!.........STAY AWAY.....There are many more dining  options cheaper, better food and better ambience both in the resort corridor and off the strip.  there is not reason to go to this place",

    "text": "If it were possible to give negative stars I would but then again a \"Star\" is for something positive, so if I could give this poor establishment of a restaurant negative remarks I most definitely would. First off my boyfriend and I went here for dinner around 8:00 pm. Only a handful of people were in the restaurant. Before going in to be seated I snapped a few pics of the rolling stones guys up front. I say that to set up what happened in the end. (Just keep this in mind). We were seated and the waitress came to take our drink orders. I ordered a water and my boyfriend order a raspberry tea. Immediately I get an attitude from our waitress because I ordered a water. (Strike 1) She brings back the drinks and says \"what would you like?\" I'm like \"we need a few more minutes to look over the menu.\"  So she walks away without even saying anything.  She finally comes back after a good 15 min.  When the waitress does come back she decides to sit down and take our ordwers. WTF?!? (Strike 2) I order the Chimichonga and my boyfriend orders the steak tacos. Mean while .... I do not see our waitress again until she beings our food out which was about 30 min. Never came to check on us or refill our cups. Once they bring the meals out I still don't see our waitress. The food tasted old and tasteless. No type of seasoning or any love was thrown into the making of our meals. The tacos hardly had any steak just an abundance of lettuce. My food was just tasteless. I guess I'm just use to Rio Grande back in my hometown of MD. Nothing at this place was fresh.   When we looked about done our waitress came to take our plates and she actually came back with the check right away. But.... why did she just stand there waiting for us to pay instead of going somewhere and tending to whatever else she gets paid to do? I mean who does that?  So I just looked at her and she got the hint. Forgot to mention that some chick came up to us while we were waiting for our order and slaps a hat on my boyfriend and says \"its resturant tradtion\" I was like what? She wanted him to wear a mexican hat and a silly mustashe so she could take a pic. She snaps a few pics and vanished. Dont worry.... towards the end she comes back with the pics asking us if we wanted to buy them. We both declined and she said \"it was worth a try.\" So as soon as we pull our money out here comes our waitress. We give her only a $4.00 tip and she didnt deserve that but we were being nice. We leave out but not before I snap a pic of my boyfriend standing next to the Rolling Stone wax men and the hostess comes running up saying \" Ms. We do not allow people to take pictures with the wax models.\" I was like \"wow, really!?\" Stupid chick unless she wanted to snatch my phone from me what the hell was she going to do about it. Worse food, even worse customer service and horrible staff! STAY AWAY!!!! Go to Margaritaville instead!!",

Maybe a good place to have a drink and watch a game, but find something else for food. My chimichanga was barely worth $5 much less the price they charge, as the chicken cubes  were sad and scarce. I went along with the group and checked Yelp as we sat down, we should have left but didn't. They try to offer guac with everything, you get a small and I mean small cup of guac that is not good at all.",

The staff there is what makes the place great. The waitresses were really fun and friendly, kept bringing us stuff even though we were sitting in the self service section. The bar managers Coco and Ian are really amazing. They were funny and nice and really talkative during the day. We went to a \"party\" there on our last night. The party was crap, they \"promoters\" who got us to go mislead us and the promotion staff there was beyond rude. A man from the promotions company yelled and cussed in my face, so close he was repeatedly spitting on me. He wouldn't tell me his name or who he worked for. The hotel did nothing. Ian and Coco stepped in and took really good care of us after that incident. I won't stay at the Flamingo again but I may stop by that restaurant again if I'm ever in Vegas just to see if they are still tending the bar.",

I don't like to jump on the bandwagon, but I just read some of these reviews I feel bad saying this but most are on point. Food was not good. The margaritas weren't bad. The picture guy did come by, but honestly we didn't mind that. It is Vegas and we got a cute picture of the hubby and I. Our waitress was Raquel (hope I spelled her name right) She was totally friendly and funny, so because of her I will give it a 2 star. Wish I could give this place a better review..",

We asked the waitress and she said it comes with a pickle. She didn't seem to know what the Mexican burger was supposed to have on it. After we showed her on the menu, she finally took it back and they added the guac and pico de gallo. My wet chicken burrito was mostly tasteless and the chicken was diced and mushy. Considering the price ($17), the burrito was small, not very good and the scoop of rice and refried beans inadequate. They didn't even serve chips and salsa. I think Carlos n' Charlie's relies on customers being too drunk to care about the taste or quantity of the food. All in all, you would be better served going elsewhere.",

This is probably more tex mex and still falls a little short  The frozen two for one margaritas are pretty good if you get the right bartender.

Even though they were open and had the drink sign up they weren't actually serving drinks yet.  So we ordered food and waited.

I am uber clumsy so when I see people throwing things and catching them too, my mind pretty much gets blown. Doesn't take much, I guess.

It included three flavors of frozen margaritas: regular, strawberry and mango.  I asked the awesome bartender Cory to pour some extra tequila in there for me each time.  I tipped $1 or $2 each time he filled my solo cup and he gave us a fun show throwing bottles around, juggling them and being super nice.  We stayed from 10:30 pm to 1:30 am and it got really hopping around midnight for some interesting people watching. The DJ played really great tunes which got better closer to midnight when it was full on the dance floor.  I cannot speak to the quality of the food, but it's a fun place to go to dance and have some cheap drinks. I didn't want to do shots, but that was an option.  The $20 special did not include beer or any top shelf drinks, but hey, it was well worth what I drank that night.",

Near by table had the same issue with food being cold.  Comped the meal but charged for the beverage. Definitely would not recommend this place. Coffee was awful and food quality is very poor.",

    "text": "A Mexican restaurant that can't make good beans should have you running for the door. If possible, this place would receive negative stars.   The service was far from great.  The food was mediocre at best.  The salad wasn't fresh (found a limpy brown piece).  They weren't busy at all yet they failed to send someone to our table to make the guacamole as described in the menu. The BBQ chicken was served cold; when told the chicken was cold, they merely heated up the same piece. (My food [chimichanga] was also not so hot, but instead of telling them I just stopped eating because it wasn't that good anyway) Oh, and one of the plates were dirty.  My hunni was immensely disappointed :( We felt a bit deceived because the hostess that showed us to our table was nice and friendly but I guess customer service doesn't reflect the quality of food. All in all, $60 at Carlos & Charlies = a crappy meal.  We had to make up for it by eating a wonderful dinner, so we went to Olives, at the Bellagio, which was delish! Review coming soon :)",

We ordered the following: Enchilada Special Burger Special Lemonade  Total with tax and tip came to $38.00  Pros: Enchilada was very delicious. Portions were very generous. I am a sucker for Habanero salsa. Salsa had a kick to it (+1) Server was attentive and very informative.  Abundant seating, TV's to catch games. Lots of specials on booze as well as food.  Cons: None.  There was an employee taking pictures and scamming us for a Las Vegas memorabilia postcard. Against the Mrs's protest, I fell for the tourist trap. *Laughs*",

Beans that have been sitting for days with a topping of old cheese and nuked in the microwave. The rice, oh heaven forbid we go there. Nasty...just nasty. The whole meal was disgusting. Our waiter was blah and it took a while to even be noticed. Our plate was not even 10% eaten and he didn't even ask \"everything okay\", \"taste good\", nothing of the sort. Seemed as if they already know what they serve is gravy train for humans. DO NOT waste your money or time here.

    "text": "Don't come here for the Mexican food. Don't come here for the awesome service. DO come here for a rollicking good time.  My sweetie pop and I had a Groupon, and we both LOVE Mexican food, so we decided to stop by after seeing the 4pm comedy magic show with Nathan Burton. We sat out on the patio near the outdoor bar. The first thing I noticed about the menu is that this place is EXPENSIVE!  Our server--Britany--was exceptionally adorable. She seemed genuinely helpful and wanted to ensure that our meal was done correctly, but she was quite \"green\" as a server. We placed our order for an entree salad as our appetizer and our food order at the same time. By the time we had taken 3 bites from our GINORMOUS salad the food runner came out with our plates. I protested and let him know (wasn't it obvious?!) that we hadn't even begun to finish our salad . He said he would bring the food back later, and he came back not more than 5 minutes later and tried to server our plates again. Really?! Yeah, we were still eating the salad, he could see that, but he still looked bewildered as to why we didn't want our entrees at that point in time.  So, finally,  another lady brings out our food, and lo! I behold the world's smallest $15 chicken burrito! Egad, I asked for a \"wet\" burrito, and they put the sauce on the bottom of the plate. Hmm, since when did wet plate = wet burrito? I'll never know.  Sweetie Pop ate the chicken enchiladas with a combination of the red and the green sauce. Salsa verde is my favorite, but theirs isn't done well here. The red sauce was much better: spicy and delicious. I've NEVER been hungry after eating an entree sized burrito, but my tiny little chicken burrito was downright pathetic. Who puts CUBED chicken in a burrito anyway? Carlos and Charlie's does.  We were attended by a number of servers, the manager and food runners. However, when we asked the same genius (insert sarcasm here:_____________) who kept bringing our food out prematurely for some water with lemons, he proceeded to bring out one glass of water and a saucer with exactly ONE, according to Sweetie Pop,  \"sad, sorry, sucked on lemon\" on it. Britney promptly corrected his error (after all there were TWO of us, so why not bring each of us  some water and lemons?) and she apologized for the series of food service mishaps.  Ultimately, I would recommend this place for the giant nachos (I saw them on someone else's table)  and the beverages. Thursday is Ladies Night, and ladies get all you can drink frozen margaritas. Bonus! After dinner we danced to the few line dances, and had a good time before calling it a night.  Carlos and Charlie's is a place for fun, not food! Those nachos looked pretty exciting though, and as my girlfriend once told me, \"It's hard to F**K up nachos.\" Too True.  p.s. Contrary to the sign on the way into the building advertising Carlos and Charlie's their happy hour has NOT been \"extended until further notice.\" It only goes until 6pm...Another disappointment since we arrived at 6:04pm. *sigh*",

Going into it expecting the norm for a restaurant on the strip is going to be over priced, with underwhelming food and service, will help keep this in perspective while dining here.",

I was actually surprised how much i like the place, we ended up going there several times last weekend.  Breakfast- Had a breakfast burrito and was surprised on how good it was, slightly spicey along side a huge pile of potatoes.  All you can drink for 20-  Me and my group of friends took advantage of this.  The only thing i didn't like was that Rolling rock was their only choice for beer.  Buy one get one Plastic Margarita glass- They were okay, a little weak.  Nachos- Must try.  These were the largest pile of nachos good enough to feed several drunk friends.  If you are a sports better you can get free drink tickets at the flamingo sports betting cage.",

It has mostly Mexican food items and a tacky Bennigans like decor. There were all kinds of random dusty nicknacks hanging from the ceiling.   It was about 7:00 PM with a DJ blasting music in a dark room with weird lights everywhere. I think they keep it dark so you can't see what you are eating. The whole vibe was weird and the place was nearly empty.   While the waiter put in the correct order, the kitchen made 2 extra (wrong) meals instead of what my friend actually ordered.   I ordered a $17 burrito  for two people to share (paid $25 with tax and tip) and it was really nasty. I felt sick immediately after eating it.  This place should really be on Bar Reacue, cuz it needs help! The only reason I gave more than one star is because our waiter was very friendly and helpful. He was really great.",

The service was lacking to say the least. The table was dirty. My coffee cup was dirty and disgusting.  My wife's pineapple juice was watered down and not even close to tasting like it should. The coffee tasted like burnt mop water. Perhaps the dinner or evening atmosphere is better. I don't know. The food was simply ok but not good enough to redeem the other issues. We have all been to dives where the food can make up for a bad experience. Not here.   As a note the manager was apologetic and took the beverages off or bill and also applied a discount with being asked for that extra step.",

The menu was not a \"regular breakfast menu\" - we were looking for American, which we were led to believe by the staff person.  Main thing was regular breakfast combo's (eggs, meat, toast/pancakes) was not on the menu.  Seemed like lot of a la carte items and few other combos that were basically eggs, plus refried beans or potatoes.  We opted for Scrambled Eggs with Potatoes (blah, didn't finish) and a Breakfast Burrito surprisingly tasty!) Relative to other places, this place is pricey for small breakfast.  It's minimum $10-13 per person (no drinks), and the 2 Eggs and Potatoes alone was $11.  Also, the guy hosting was not totally overt, but he was condescending.  Offered to sit us at the bar first (nobody else was there and there were tons of tables open) and when we asked for table, he sighed and led us to a booth next to a large noisy group (gee, thanks!).  Waitress was rather scattered . . . We saw the manager(?) serve food - She leaned over a kid across the large group's table to hand a plate to a woman - seriously?  Need to go to waitressing school!  (And, even though we almost ran into him, no \"thanks for coming\" - He definitely needs to learn about customer service or just get an attitude agjustment . . .)  Go do the buffet or head to Denny's or somewhere else.  We wouldn't come back to this place . . . And, given how happy they were to seat and serve us, we won't be back for any other meal either.",

I ordered the chicken flautas. They basically throw them in a fryer (for way to long) so the ends are fried to a crisp and when I finally got past the over crispy  part.... I hit the dried out rough chicken part. They serve you three but I only ate one and half before I realized it wasn't gonna taste any better. The rice wasn't so bad. It was tasteful and fluffy but the canned beans have got to go. Gross!! It was obvious our server didn't want to be there anymore than I did after tasting the food.

    "text": "This place just gives off a \"Meh\" vibe. On the bright side, it is located inside the Flamingo and you can get relatively inexpensive food and drinks. On the downside, the quality of products and service match the price point, so it isn't much of a bargain. I've been here for both the food and the nightlife, so I'll cover both separately.     Food: Pretty mediocre bar & grille food but at a very reasonable [Vegas] price. I paid (thanks to losing card roulette) for 4 people, including a few drinks and tip, and it was right at $100. I had a grilled chicken sandwich, and I don't remember anyone being overly impressed with their food.     Nightlife: We were passing by just after 1am on a Thursday and they were clearly having a party. Dark flashing lights, club music, and the place looked packed through the small window opening. The promoters out front tried to rope us in for the open bar, which lasted until 3. We wanted to go in and scope out the scene, but somehow the promoter convinced us we didn't need to do that. After a bit of price negotiation, we decided to go in around 1:30. They poured plenty of strong drinks (if you tip well), but they closed the bar at 2:30, not 3am, so we really only got 2-3 drinks for the $15 plus some obnoxious tips to get service. The place wasn't overly crowded, but they had select sections closed off so it seemed much busier than it really was.     I'd like to tell you that I won't be back, but in Vegas if you can get an edible meal and an open bar for $40 per person, you take it.",

They are located at the Flamingo on the Las Vegas Strip. We had a Groupon. We initially contacted the restaurant on Tuesday night, at 10:30 PM and were told the restaurant closed at 2 AM, I checked their website on the Flamingo website and same thing- it was open until the \"wee hours\". PERFECT. We are STARVING!  We drive over to the Flamingo, park and walk over to the restaurant. It looks empty, except for a few individuals at the bar. We walk in and the bartender bluntly says they are closed and the kitchen is closed and cannot serve us. No \"I'm sorry\". No \"We open at xxx tomorrow and close at xxx\". NOTHING. Jerk.  Well we decide to give them a try the NEXT day. Same guy, didn't remember us, fine. Whatever. We sit down, I order a drink and my boyfriend orders a water for the mean time while he looks over the menu. They had a special, 2 Rolling Rocks for $7. Not bad- he goes with that. We chit-chat, look over the menu, chit-chat some more, give our order. My boyfriend orders Street Tacos with guacamole at a whopping $2-3 more and I order the Fish Tacos, no guar.   Here comes our order... three street tacos and guac on a plate and three fish tacos. The Street Tacos were good, but for $15, plus the price of the guac, and NO rice or beans to accompany them, sorry! Those should be much less. Yes, I understand it IS Las Vegas, BUT geez louise- don't go all out on the price if you are not adding anything to accompany the tacos! My fish tacos were hard! VERY HARD! Was I unhappy. The breading was much bigger than the actual piece of fish.  I'll finish this off on a good note.. just kidding.. BAD NOTE! Not once did the lazy bartender ever come to see how our food was. There were two bartenders at the bar, one had about two or three groups and our bartender only had us to wait on. The other bartender was constantly making drinks for the tables, conversating with the other guests/customers. Ours was just there with a lame straight face on. So uncomfortable.   I just wanted to leave.  Mind you- ANOTHER customer came up to the bar, talked to our bartender about her experience and the lousy service she received. He gave her a comment card, I wish I could of gotten my hands on one of those.  Just in case you are wondering- No, I did NOT TIP.",

The lime was virtually in drinkable.  The mango and the strawberry were decent. Nothing I'd go back for though.

The sides that came with it had been sitting out for a while... Sour cream was watery and the cabbage/coleslaw mixture has been sitting out in the heat....it was turning sour. Kinda icky. Overall this was a 'meh' experience.",

My girlfriend and I stopped in here late on our first night in Vegas. We started with Margarita's and an order of Guacamole. The Margarita's were OK, but the Guacamole was the best thing we had all night. It was made fresh to order right in front of us. Our entree's were below average, even for a chain Mexican place. According to the menu, my Cheese Burrito was supposed to be filled with Cheddar and Jack Cheese with veggies. What it was was a Tortilla filled with onions and green pepper's with barely any cheese in it at all.  My girlfriend ordered the Chicken Enchiladas in Red Salsa. She summed up the Meh of this place perfectly after tasting my Burrito. She said that both our dishes tasted like they came out of the same pot.  Pretty sad when you consider how different our entree's should have been.    Our service was OK, but confusing. Our Server's seemed to switch about one third of the way through our meal and then the first Server reappeared when our check came out. They are wheelchair accessible, but I can't see ever coming back here unless it's to sit at the bar, have a couple drinks and order some Guacamole.",

Our server (I think Rocky - her name was smudged) was very attentive and helpful to our table. The HH specials were great for our group of 4. We got two Marg's for $10...and the boys got deals on their beers, but I don't exactly remember what it was. We ordered the chips & salsa & altho they weren't bottomless, there was plenty for the 4 of us.   I ordered the chicken quesadilla off the App menu & it was a perfect little meal. My brother asked for their HOTTEST sauce/salsa. It came out & holy smokes it was hot! I spread a tiny dot on my quesadillas.  (OH the Gauc was REALLY good!)  The prices all seemed really reasonable & Yelp has all sorts of deals when you check in. We will be back on our next Vegas trip!",

    "text": "To sum it up: terrible Mexican food, small portions, weak drinks, too expensive, loud, slow to get your food, crowded, and they don't give you chips and salsa unless you buy it.  First off, this place was way loud. We thought it was a Mexican restaurant but it was a Mexican sports bar. The food wasn't great at all. My husband enjoyed his but my beans were weird and my enchiladas too spicy and tasteless. Rice was tasteless too. My meal was 17$ for three crappy enchiladas and rice and beans! That's ridiculous! We ordered a $12 quesadilla and it was small and cut into four pieces. Delicious...but for $12!? To top it of they don't even serve chips and salsa as a compliment, you have to pay $5 for them! The drinks were $10 a pop and while what we had was delicious it was ridiculously weak. I'm a lightweight and I didn't get a buzz. The service was extremely slow, but our server was nice and polite, although forgetful. I think he was busy because it seemed crowded and probably understaffed. Ended up spending $100 we regret. Definitely don't go here!",

I ordered the Mexican Omelette with came with salsa, chorizo, cheese, etc. I ordered the omelette without tomatoes and onions and with a side of potatoes. The waitress brought out my food and it came with beans - so i ordered a side of potatoes. I then went to eat it and realized it was loaded with tomatoes and onions. The restaurant wasn't busy, so I find this frustrating. Because at this point, they were no longer serving breakfast.   It was okay overall and I ate most of. My friends weren't the biggest fans of their burritos, but they said it was \"okay.\" They only ate half of them. It was a very expensive brunch and we ended up spending about $35 a piece with tip. This did include a $5 bloody mary which was really good. That was the highlight of the meal!  I'd recommend checking out a different place while in Vegas. Sorry Carlos and Charlies, not for me.",

Came here on a Monday to kill a little time before our flight out. There was one server for the entire patio, which was steadily busy. I was a server for 5 years; I know, even a great server, cannot take care of 12+  tables and give adequate service. We were not greeted promptly, waited forever for drinks and even more foreverer (?!) for our food.  My comrades and I had beef enchiladas, Chicken tacos, and chicken sandwich. I don't think a single plate at our table was even half gone; food was just bad. No free chips and salsa like the good ole Mexican restaurants. Bland. Fatty and questionable meat. Ugh! Then we waited a while to get  out checks and eventually get out of there.   Save yourself time and a happy belly to go anywhere else:: even the buffet, tropical cafe, or pizza joint at the Flamingo.",

    "text": "I can't believe I failed to write my review so long ago! The memories still leave me shuddering... bleh.  This place suuuucks. Food, service, prices, everything! The colorful, \"chaotic\" decor was what brought my friends, husband and I in on one not-yet-drunken afternoon for lack of more variety of places to eat in our hotel, and we were starving.  I immediately Yelped and was pretty terrified to eat here. I mean really, I think a restaurant actually has to work at it to get so many incredibly low ratings. Once seated we ordered one of those massive margaritas which my girlfriends shared (such a waste of money; the cup is shaped like a fatty goblet but is really hollowed out like a wine flute inside.. bye bye $$$).   I ordered what seemed to be the safest thing on the menu - a cheese quesadilla with guacamole ($11.90 + 2.00 for guac... this thing better be gourmet!). I can't remember what everyone else ordered but they all seemed to shoot for \"safer\" options as well. My top-dollar quesadilla, which was really just a couple flour tortillas with melted shredded cheese in between, arrived with no guac. I tried to flag our waitress down but she completely ignored us after our food was delivered.  Then we tried to flag her down again for another round of waters. Ignore, ignore, ignore - we got the attention of a busboy who said he'd tell her but she still never came.   Then they turned on that hokey cha cha slide song and tried to get everyone up, servers and patrons, to dance. Our waitress amazingly reappeared to try and drag me to dance and I kindly refused and asked, \"can I just get a water please??\" She ignored me and went to dance. I honestly could not believe her!  In the end we never got waters, I never got guac (and she attempted to charge me for it), and our waitress \"split the bill\" between me and my friends but charged some of their expensive margarita onto mine. When I pointed out the error she said I was wrong, and the bill was just fine. I was done fighting with her so we paid and left NO tip. I can count less than five times in my life I've done that but in this case it was well-deserved. We will NEVER go back",

I ordered the grilled chicken caesar salad which was good , my fiance ordered the chimichanga to which he was pleased with . We also had the cheese dip which was GREAT, our friends had the Platter and it was so much food that two grown men to be precise were not able to finish the dish. The food was good service was good and the food order was correct as well as table maintenance including the evident teamwork when our servers co-worker delivered the food.      We had a great experience with with waiter as well as the manager Ian Dyer who went over and beyond as well as managing to regain my trust and assurance that we will return. When we told the waiter we had a discount for <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> at the end of the meal. He sent over another guy who I assumed to be the floor manager on duty who was completely rude to me. (his attire was a black shirt with black pants). When I showed him the discount that I was wanting to apply to our check via <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fresteraunt.com&s=e224fb3d0a6f3a0ce635c0de3e76feafbdd3a1f398ad369dc55be8fb3ae049ed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">resteraunt.com</a> he instructed me to \"stop yelling at him\" when I was simply trying to apply the discount. When he left the table and returned he then corrected us that we could not use our \"Groupon\" on the check. This I could understand if I were to use a Groupon it would make sense rather than <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> discount that I was trying to apply to the check.",

The chips and salsa are a set price (aprox. $6) but I can't complain, because it is the Las Vegas strip and here you get what you pay for. Or, you pay for what you get.   The wait time isn't extremely lengthy. It actually is perfect, especially if you're in a large group. All in all, the environment is very fun.

Jen was our waitress and she was SUPER, the Street Carnitas were delicious and we had 2 of the super HUGE VERY TASTY LIME MARGARITAS ! The Margaritas had a nice little kick ! There was also a table Magician named WilliAm Mandell who was simply  AMAZING!! Right in front of our eyes he did some trix that were mind blowing and he even let us keep the cards he used in his act where we wrote our name on them! Still can't figure out how he did this trick!!We ARE SO GLAD we stopped in to Carlos and Charlie's for dinner and drinks! The food was plentiful and delicious and fresh and we had unexpected entertainment with fantastic lime margaritas!!Thank you Carlos n Charlie's  staff, chef, management JEN OUR FANTASTIC SWEET WAITRESS AND WILLIAM THE AMAZING FUNNY MAGICIAN!!! We will be back every day this next week for more! Thank you and much Love to you all for making our day better!!",

We sat on the patio and ate dinner and drank margaritas.  It was simply an amazing experience.  When we planed our second trip we decided to bring friends with us.  This time wasn't as good.  The drink cups were smaller, the prices were raised, and a really annoying magician was going from table to table trying to get tips.  We will probably give them one more shot but I'm hoping this time it's more like the first experience than the second.  Our friends were shocked that we had raved about this place.",

Also, the sides of rice have every time of bean in them imaginable, like Lima beans, green beans, peas. Weird. Then she recommended my other two friends split a portion of nachos because they're really big, then when they tried to split them on the check, she said she wasn't able to \"alter prices\". Speaking of checks, when we asked her for our checks, she came back with one for the whole table. And then we tried to tell her who's food was with what, and that all the drinks we got were the same price so it didn't matter who's drink was with , but she tried to say one of the drinks was on the happy hour buy 2 for 1 menu (which she didn't even tell us when we ordered them?) and then charged someone who actually got the free drink. It was just a mess, honestly would not recommend. Oh, I almost forgot, we asked for waters when we got food and never even got the waters.",

I enjoyed my meal. My friend ordered the Chicken in Mole Sauce. We both tried each other's and both agreed mine was better. Her chicken had a little too much sauce. She still said it was okay. She mentioned that she got the Parmesan and Swiss Chicken before, and it was really good. We got the two-for-one margaritas with a coupon they were passing out in the casino. My friend got the classic margarita and said it was good, and I got the mango margarita, and it was way too sweet.  They were trying to force a party to start, so that was a little annoying at first, because I was hungry and trying to eat, and they were trying to bribe me to dance (offering free tequila shots if I did the Wobble with them or whatever they were doing.) Looking back, I should have accepted. lol. Oh well.  After we ate, it was fun. People started showing up and drinking and dancing more. They were playing good music. They were training a new shot girl, and so we got a bunch of free shots because they were showing her how to count pours and how to be more flirty and fun with the customers. That was cool.  We ended up leaving and heading elsewhere on The Strip. But it seemed like it would be a good time if you stayed all night. Apparently, it's all you can drink for the ladies after you pay $13 for your first drink. I'd come back again and check that out.",

Taco Bell has more authentic Mexican food than this place.  The only plus is that, during off hours like mid-afternoon on a weekday, the service is reasonably paced. But still.  The food is really awful.  If you consider Taco Bell good authentic Mexican food, than you might give this place 3 stars (its still overpriced and small portions).  If you expect more quality, then its a one-star-wonder.  Three tiny tacos were $16, and that only included Rice-a-Roni style rice.  Beans were extra??!!  So with a single drink and a tip getting a taco plate with beans will run one person $25.  My suggestion is to keep going.  Anywhere else.",

Plus, he was shining it in people's eyes, such as mine and I was clear across the room.  Waitresses stop & dance, so if you need service quickly, it will be hard to grab them at that time.  The chips and salsa were awesome!  However, it was too bad that it was not free w/dining.  The fajitas didn't really have any special or different flavoring.  It was kinda bland.  Overall experience was ok.  Would recommend this place more for dining before going to a club or another bar atmosphere.  We took our 2 year old son, not the greatest place for kids, but in some cases think the entertainment was a bit of a distraction-could go either way.  Pros:  -Chips, Salsa  -music, dancing, noise can be good for kids - distraction  -Good place before going out - good party kinda atmosphere   Cons:  -Very loud  -Strobe light effect with a flashlight  -Can be bad for family  -not good for business meetings or discussion  -wait staff not very quick and stop and dance  -chips/salsa and guacamole took a long time to bring out - have to pay for chips/salsa (not included)  -More pricey than most places  -Not conveniently located if you are driving to the Flamingo - parking there sucks and walking to restaurant is further   If you are looking for more of a bar atmosphere before going out and getting some drinks maybe even chips/salsa, this may be a good place.    4 people with 2 year old = $100/dinner price (did not include drinks)  -2 hamburgers  -chips and salsa -guacamole  -1 Fajitas beef/chicken combo (shared by 2) with shrimp -side of corn  -side of veggies   =little pricey   Groupon helped and not sure if we would go back w/out it!",

I broke my ankle out at the Flamingo pool and had borrowed a wheelchair from the hotel, and I asked him what the easiest way was to get through the restaurant to reach where my friends were sitting and he was not helpful. I told him nevermind, and asked if I could park the wheelchair somewhere out of the way so I could just hobble to my table. That's when he started treating me like I had a mental handicap and even started yelling at me.   I was very upset and the waiter tried to assure me that the host probably didn't speak enough english to understand me. But then we ordered brunch and the experience got even worse. The bacon looked like it had been sitting on the floor for a few days and even stepped on several times. And, the bloody marys were all ice.  Sure, it's conveniently located if you're staying at the Flamingo but the horrible stomach aches and verbal abuse by the staff is not worth it.",

You would expect the first impression  of a Mexican restaurant is their unique salsa not bottled salsa where you can get at Walmart. Then they have the audacity to give the chips in a white bag, since they are so lazy they can't even put it in a basket or plate. Hate to see how the food turns out. Here is hoping!!!",

There is no  one in that kitchen worthy of being called a chef! They did not even put all of the ingredients in the dish! I guess I was not supposed to notice there was no Chorizo in my Quesadilla, Really? Not everyone that visits Vegas is from Podunk! The margarita was good. The end!",

(We were close, at the Linq, family night.) Worst idea.  Our waiter was nice,  felt bad for the guy. The rest of the staff was very unprofessional. Bussers/waiters walking around with their shorts hanging off their butts; waitresses in tank tops with boobs almost falling out. A bartender trying to hit on me on my way to the bathroom.  We ordered mini burgers for the kids, husband ordered a carne asada taco salad,  and I ordered a burrito. The kids food came out first; they enjoyed it.  Then the taco salad, which came out of a prepackaged bag and with chicken on it, not carne asada . Had to send it back. Everyone was halfway into dinner,  and still no burrito.  So I ate one of the mini burgers, which wasn't bad.  Watched my husband eat what looked like the worst meal he ever had....  Still no burrito.  I asked for the check and for my food to go.  Fifteen minutes later we got our check,  and the waiter kindly told us the salad and burrito would both be taken off the check.  I couldn't wait any longer to get out of the place so I told him just to keep it.  No doubt this place needs some serious help.  It wasn't worth my time.",

Way, way too much cheese, no onions or peppers, (Server told me they were in there. If so, they were so small I could see or taste them. ) The smothered part was just a cold salsa on the side.  Could hardly eat it, and was so tasteless. My husband had the chicken burrito bowl. A very small amount of tiny minced up chicken, white rice, and mixed veggies. This was even worse than the burrito. Absolutely NO taste. Who uses white rice with green beans, lima beans, carrots and corn in a Mexican dish??? He couldn't finish it, SO BAD!! Guacamole is 1.99 extra and is maybe a tablespoon with mainly onion.  We spent over $50 here in food. I would definitely pass this place up. Probably the worst food on the strip. Sad we wasted our time and money here.",

The African American security guard actually yelled at us that \"she was a woman\" (who dressed like a man, and therefore our experience was supposed to be lessened).   A note to Raphael and the security guard: if you're trying to create an enjoyable experience, you're failing miserably. You shouldn't ever YELL at patrons, especially a female. It might make you feel tough, but this is a bar. Get a grip.  To everyone else, save yourself the disappointment. I wish I could give zero stars.",

I did pop my head up fans ask how his burrito was, he said really good. Then I was back to stuffing my face. Lol.   My complaint is the margaritas weak as hell!!! That frozen slush tasted like a slurpee from 7-11 I had mango and he had strawberry after asking our server if there was any corn products in them because he is allergic to corn. She said not in the strawberry but yes in the mango. Oh and they were out of passion fruit btw I love passion fruit anything!!! We there must have been corn syrup in the strawberry margarita because he got violently ill like he always does when corn is involved. This is why only one star. We checked with our server about corn in his food and his drink and told her that he was allergic to corn and corn products. Apparently their staff is not trained on food allergies. I'm guessing fructose was in the margarita mix which is a corn byproduct.   Had that not happened we would have given them 5 stars.",

Couldn't come close to finishing it. It wasn't great but it wasn't horrible either. Just your average Vegas Mexican food I suppose.   We each had 2 beers and were on our way! No complaints here!

Looking at other reviews, don't come here sober... you will not have a good time. I mean.... some people don't seem to like this place very much.",

    "text": "We were suckered into checking out Carlos' n Charlie's on a Thursday evening by one of the guys walking around the hotel handing out wristbands. He told us that we would get in for free with an open bar. Awesome, right?! Well, the wristband was good for the cover, but we had to pay $20 per person to get a red solo cup that was good for four drinks only.  We went in expecting to get out money's worth and were really disappointed with the crowd. Sure, it was Thursday, but there were maybe 20 people inside. Whatever.  We went to the bar and got decent service from a flashy bartender with a whistle who poured essentially a red solo cup full of vodka. Awesome, right?! Yeah, if you reallllllyyyy love vodka. We couldn't have finished four drinks unless we wanted to end up in the ER. So it really ended up to be a $20 cup of vodka. Also, the DJ was just awful. Occasionally he would play a song that people knew and would dance to, but he was sloppy and the music was terrible. I think there are many better places in Vegas to spend your money!",

There were probably 4 other tables groups of people in the entire restaurant while I was there, and STILL, the service was unbearably slow. My order was wrong, and cold, and tasted worse than Taco Bell tastes on it's worst day. Consequently I didn't eat more than 3 bites of my dinner because my stomach couldn't take it. My waiter kept forgetting about me. The time between when I sat down and was finally asked my order, was about 15 minutes. The time for my food to arrive was another 20. To get my corrected order took another 10. When I asked for my check, it took another 10 minutes just to bring it over to my table. Do not eat here. Don't waste your money. Go get a taco out of a vending machine and it will taste better than this place.",

Sadly it wasn't; the food and the quality of the open bar is so low and cheap that I could only drank a half margarita. And it was all I had for the night. We asked for a refund of the Open Bar  -which they refused-  since we were not willing to drink more of that weird stuff they serve as alcohol. Instead we were offered a \"comp real Bacardi\" which it wasn't enough to make it up for it. We decided to go, I feel robbed.",

I went there for a drink and had the house margarita on the rocks which was fine, typical house margarita. We had ordered the table side guacamole and it was disgusting!!!! Avocadoes were basically frozen so they were barely mashed and every bite you felt like you were eating icy avocadoes. The chips that came along with the guacamole were OK but the guac was such a turnoff we barely ate. We didn't stay long due to lack of an experience. A couple sits down next to us and orders the 2 for 1 margaritas. As we get our bill we see we paid full price so when we inquired with the 1 bartender for the whole entire restaurant he states the deal is only for frozen margaritas. Hello??? Wouldn't a bartender mention specials to their patrons? If we were aware we defiantly would have had the frozen margaritas. I honestly don't know how this place stays alive. Decor was gross and the bar was lacking any type of friendly positive vibes. This is a defiantly a do not go to place in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I was really disappointed after seeing such great reviews on Groupon. This was one of the worst restaurant experiences and food I have had in Vegas. I think Groupon needs to educate their vendors on the reason why people by groupons...to save money...NOT so that we will \"get a free meal\" by not spending more then the groupon amount.   They have a good atmosphere, almost like a college bar, its fun, loud music and people pouring shots. But the food is terrible. Cold chicken and steak, like its been sitting in the back all day (worse than then chicken cubes soaking in broth at Subway) The food was just bland, no flavor or spice. My tacos came with a \"side\" of beans. The side was a one ounce cup filled with an over salted pile of mush. Luckily I didn't get the side of rice or guacamole that was suggested, everything was $2 or more extra. Also, what Mexican restaurant makes you pay for chips and salsa!?!?   On top of the terrible food, our server just hassled us all night about the Groupon. We spent only 38$ since the food was so bad I couldn't bring myself to try the \"delicious\" dessert suggested by the waitress who also suggested the \"amazing\" beans. Since we only spend $38 and the Groupon was for $40 the waitress made a huge deal and said we had to order more. Then she said 'well treat me right and I can get my manager to maybe over ride it. Even though that means you are getting your meal for free\"  WTF!!! Who is getting a free meal?? We BOUGHT a groupon!!!! She told us at least 5 times to tip her well because she got us a free meal. I was so angry that we even left her any tip, I would have rather spent that tip money on a slot machine. Please do yourself a favor and don't go here",

Waited at the host stand for at least 10 minutes before being spoken to, the host then told us that seating outside was unavailable and didn't know how long it would take for a table to open up. So he seats us in the dining room at a somewhat dirty table. Maybe 2 minutes later he is taking a party of two outside...no seating outside my ass. Anyways, our server, Victoria, took at least 10-15 minutes to get to us and was completely rude. We had ordered chips and salsa as an app and when it had not arrived after 20 minutes of waiting we asked if she forgot and she said no it takes time. She definitely forgot to ring it in and then came out immediately with it. The frozen margaritas were gross and tastes like there was no tequila in it. Finally our food comes out and we have no silverware but our server is no where to be found. After waiting 3-4 minutes to ask her for silverware. We asked her repeatedly for waters and didn't get them until the end of the meal. When she brought the check the check said she ran our food in at 12:03 when we ordered around 11:30.  She also ignored us majority of the time and talked to us like we were stupid. I will never ever return to this establishment.",

I visited their restaurant in Cancun last year and we were treated like royalty..., here, we were treated as if they were doing us a favor. They were not busy yet it took the hostess 5 minutes to seat us. The table was wobbly and the seats were worn out. No drink orders nor were we given napkins and silverware! After 15 mins, a waiter stops and asks us if we'd like a drink. We ordered but 5 mins later, another server came and asked us if we were ready to order. About 10 mins. later our drinks arrive - we did not finish them! Chips and salsa are decent. The food arrived: carne asada burrito and chicken quesadilla with bean/rice. The chicken was overly spicy and dry. The tortilla was soggy and the cheese wasn't completely melted. The burrito was OK but nothing spectacular. Neither of us finished our dinner which cost: $78!! I did not leave a tip which was difficult for me because I have family in the restaurant business.  I would give less than a star if I could.",

We love reading Yelp reviews and everyone's experience can be different.   My wife has been to the Carlos N Charlies at Acapulco, but she wasn't expecting the same results as she is from there :)  I first presented my coupon which they said no problem and took our order. I opted for the 20 oz Cadillac margarita. This had a great flavor and left me with a slight buzz.  My wife had a virgin Pina colada, not sure if this was machine made or just a perfect blended result.    She opted for the Mole Enchiladas and I had the carna asada tacos.   The carna asada tacos had a lot of meat on them. More than the photos from CNC. I liked the flavor and they were very filling. They were better than I was expecting.  My wife said the mole was very good. Mole is a serious business to her :) She liked the enchiladas as well. But said the mole made the meal. The prices were on point with what other Mexican places on the strip charge. Just have to be used to the Strip prices :)  The waiter was nice and let us know this is also a club at night. We may go back for the club in July! Thanks for having us!",

The food is also pricey, with nothing much cheaper than $15. However, what still earns this place three stars is the atmosphere and location. Tucked away near the Flamingo hotel pool, Carlos n Charlie's offers plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, complete with misters that make 110 feel like 78 degrees. There are interesting decor items on the walls and bar stools that feature sexy lady legs. The servers are also pretty nice and welcoming, which is a major plus in Vegas. If seated outdoors, you'll also get a decent few of the flamingos and other wildlife located at the Flamingo. Worth visiting, just apologize to your wallet before and after.",

First off the hostess didn't smile whatsoever when we walked up to the stand. When she took us to our table, she put the menus down on the table and walked away without saying a thing. The chairs were so broken and wobbly that I was scared it would break. And, the person with me had the same fear with his chair. When we asked to be moved to a booth, the hostess was irritated and when we sat down, both sides of the booth were too low for the table, so it felt like little kids that wanted to ask for a booster seat. And, as far as the food goes... it was HORRIBLE!! I had a quesadilla and didn't think anyone could screw that up? My margarita was way too tart. The server never came back, so we just tried to make the most of it. My dinner companion ordered a chicken bowl of some sort and said it tasted like mush. And, before we even paid the bill, both of our stomachs were upset. The entire experience was awful. When the bill came we were both shocked by the total cost which was $56.00 for the worst meal ever. Do yourself a favor.... skip this place!",

So I selected this spot inside the Flamingo.  I was greeted by a friendly female host.  Hub & I decided to sit outside and enjoy the warmth.  The server, Denise, was very friendly, cool.  We ordered non-drinks, shrimp tacos & steak tacos.   It only took 10 mins.  I ordered the shrimp tacos which looked like they used Booth's pre-breaded frozen shrimp and carefully measured 3 shrimps per taco.  I have done this at home but at least add 6-7 not 3.  Plus it was a tad greasy for $20.  The rice was sticky, even the black beans didn't lubricate them.  The black beans were more blah, nothing exciting.  I love beans but this way will make u give them up.  The guac was average.  Taco Bell's had more flavor, zest.  The chips were as stall as 1 year old chewing gum.  No sea salt!!  Better yet let's let them soak in salt, they would have more flavor.  The salsa was more like whipped ketchup with a couple of ingredients.  This would explain why they want u to drink the 45 oz Big Mama margarita.  That's where the sea salt is, around the rim.  The patio is nice, spacious, birds flying everywhere.  Nature meets u!! Lol.  Would I recommend this place??   I'm not gonna make that determination for u, but I love seasoned food and quality food.  After reading this review do u think I found it??",

It wasn't too pricey, considering Las Vegas can REALLY get you on a bill.  SERVICE:  Poor.  This is where it all went south.  It was incredibly dark in the area we were sitting.  The  only light was a string of lights that couldn't attract a moth.  Our server greeted was prompt at first, but then it turned into a test of patience.  Things seemed to take FOREVER!

Once we had ordered our food, it took almost 45 minutes to arrive, which tells me the kitchen was slammed as well. Twice we had someone attempt to deliver the incorrect order to our table, which ended up being for the tables around us.  The food was just ok - shrimp quesadilla was a little undercooked (cheese not completely melted) and very overpriced at $16. The habanero sauce is legit though - super hot! That was nice. The \"big mama\" drinks are not much more than a pint - we tested refilling one from a water glass. It's mostly just thick plastic. Once we were done eating, it took forever to get the check and another forever for them to process the payment. Luckily we were with good company, but I'd definitely not come back by choice.",

After looking at the menu, everything was over priced. We decided to stay to grab something simple, and there were two servers standing in front of our table arguing that neither of them wanted to take our table. WHAT!? We could literally hear them, and instead of one of them deciding to help us, they both just walked away and we were never helped!!   We got up and left immediately. I couldn't believe the service at this place. Glad we didn't spend any money there because they do not deserve it!",

    "text": "I would give this place NO stars if I could. Went there for lunch with a friend when we were craving mexican cantina food (hoping it would be like paradise cantina). At around 11:45am it was still pretty empty so we were seated quickly and the server came over and took our drink order. He asked if he could sit down a few times which I thought was totally inappropriate seeing as he interrupted our conversation to ask. I was initially craving a taco salad of some sort but the only dressings they had to offer were Caesar and Italian. I was hoping for a more south of the border salad so I chose the chicken enchiladas (who doesn't love rice and beans and sauce!!) my friend ordered a chicken sandwich and fries. Our server told us that he didn't like our choices and tried to push us toward other (more pricy and larger dinner entree style) options. We explained why we chose what we chose and our food was delivered to us within 5 min. I'm not usually one to be negative about quick service but 5 min seemed a little microwaved or pre-cooked and warmed up to me. Regardless we thanked them for the quick service. We the dishes were put down in front of us my friends chicken sandwich looked good. Hot, crisp but thick french fries and a juicy chicken filet. My chicken enchiladas however were topped with a red sauce that tasted like a pizza sauce or thin marinara and then melted over everything was SWIS CHEESE. WTF?!?! I had my friend taste everything just to be sure I wasn't losing my mind and sure enough....italian red sauce and swiss cheese covered my enchiladas. SO WEIRD!! Needless to say I eat much of the enchiladas and was looking forward to the rice and beans but even they were \"rice a roni\" style spanish rice and the beans weren't fresh or very good either. SO GROSS!!!  The busier was quick to clear our plates but that was when the quickness stopped. The restaurant was no busier than when we arrived but we had to wait 45 minutes for the server to bring us the check and another 20 minutes for his to run our credit cards. He about disappeared a few times. I think it's really sad when it takes only 5 minutes from ordering our food to receiving our food and then an hour to pay the check?! COME ON FLAMINGO....UP YOUR GAME HERE. THE PRICES ARE WAY TO HIGH AND THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE AND THE SERVICE WASN'T REALLY THERE.",

We were told that it states on the menu that checks are not to be split (still not sure where that's stated).  We were never notified by the waitress that checks could not be split.  After speaking with the manager they still would still not split them.  This ment many members of the wedding party had to go to the ATM for cash.

Since we had happy hour, we were provided with 2 for 1 Magaritas (So glad). I must say the patio was so beautiful for dining al fresco with a nice dj playing that time. The food was exactly as advertised on their website (Even better then that, i Just loved it). The most delicious food I found were BBQ Chipotle ribs and the charlie's tacos with corn tortilla (yum yum). I also tried Habanero Salsa (They call it Tooth Of Satan) which was ridiculously HOT & Delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone who is going to / lives in Las Vegas, try this out and you would love it. I just want to go their everyday. Had awesome time there. Highly Recommended.",

    "text": "Went there last night before going to a show. We didnt get complimentary salsa and chips like most mexican restaurants. But that wasn't the issue. The prices are high for what you get. Ordered a burrito and it came with dried out refried beans. No lettuce or salsa even.  The burrito was terrible. The rest of the party had tacos and fajitas. No one was crazy about the food. I dont know what was worse - the food or the service. When we were done with the meal the server brought the check without saying anything. Just plopped it down. What if I wanted dessert or coffee? We couldnt wait to get out of there. Seriously, something needs to be done. We will not return.",

We were there with a group of about 20 and by the end of our stay (at the hotel) they knew each and everyone of our names!  They have the best personalities and make the best drinks on the strip!!  They made some of the best Guac I have had in a long time..   If you're in the Vegas Area..  Make sure to stop by the Flamingo Hotel and Grab a Drink (or two) from these guys!!!  Tell them the Chicago Crew says \"HI\"",

I should've known better and saved my friends and I from eating here when I was about to check in on my phone but we were hungry and wanted to eat ASAP. First off, horrible service! My friend specifically asked for something to be not on her food and they messed up the order! When my food came it was freezing cold. I never complain about food being cold but honestly, my food felt as though it was placed in the fridge for an hour so I sent back my food to get reheated. I could tell it was reheated and just sat there before it was served to me again because the tortillas for my tacos were dry and crunchy yet the meat was still cold! I didn't wanna waste anymore time here so I decided to shut up and just eat the horrible quality meat. The chorizo was okay, but the chicken tasted fake to me, yuck. Mind you our food took forever to come out! The manager was kind enough to give us free chips and salsa... guess I'll give the one star to the manager. Other than that, this place needs to seriously work on management and food quality.  Oh yeah, all of our waters were empty for a good 20-35 minutes and nobody came by to refill our drinks so I literally got up and found a pitcher of water and refilled all of our drinks. Customers shouldn't be doing that!!",

I tried to look this place up on Yelp right before we walked in because we weren't too keen on it, but I couldn't get service! Our foolish selves were so starved we didn't feel like walking any further...so we ate there...the other person is right, if you don't know any better about Mexican food, you will like it; but if you do know Mexican food you will be disappointed. Your stomach will regret eating here later :/ This place only survives because it's in the casino and there is heavy foreign traffic who don't know any better (or are severely hungry like er were ) . Never again will I eat here...if this place was in a neighborhood, they would be out of business so fast. Go to HASH HOUSE A GO GO instead!!! ...if you can even read this before you enter",

The restaurant was not busy and the service was still terrible, to start they managed to screw up a simple drinks order, even the beers were wrong ! The waiter then returned with the correct drinks and the beers were only filled up to where we had taken a drink from.....They could not even fill them up and at $17.50 for each beer, I think they are the most expensive on the strip ! Food was trerrible and a poor excuse for Mexican. We originally lived in Austin and this is nothing like Carlos and Charlies at Lake Travis, or they would have been out of business long ago !  Very expensive, poor food and no atmosphere - do yourself a favor and steer clear. There is much better available (almost all is better than this !).",

Cold meat/no salsa on the tacos, wilted lettuce & canned corn on the salad, and to top it off a $60 check?? I think not, sir.

My husbands carne asada burrito looked like it had all the left over greasy meat inside.  Needless to say we called the manager over.

I think Carlos 'n Charlie's is a nighttime weekend drinking spot, but definitely not a middle of the day lunch spot.  It was fairly empty, which is fine, but there was nothing there to make me want to recommend it to anyone.  The young hostess in the front was not particularly friendly nor welcoming.  Angie M. was our server.  She was a little gruff but friendly and attentive.  She made the guacamole at our table.  It was good but it just needed more salt.  Easily fixed.  I liked that she asked if we wanted the jalapenos in the guacamole (I didn't).    I settled for the cheese enchiladas with red sauce.  They were just okay.  Not horrible, but okay.  JAS had the burger and I don't recall if he liked it or not.  It was just one of those places where I wish we had decided to have lunch somewhere else.",

My food came out cold but I didn't say anything because I was hungry. My friend ordered shrimp tacos and she couldn't eat them because they were undercooked; there was gray coloring in the middle of the shrimp. My friend mentioned his burrito also was cold. Really made us lose our appetite and put a damper in our evening. It was an especially lackluster experience because the items are so over priced!",

Also there was this raffle for an all expense trip to Cancun, and yeah someone in our party won it, along with more free shots.

They were not very strong, but were delicious as I observed the birds and koi in the garden.    At 2pm on a Friday, the place was empty, maybe due to the fact that the outdoor area was closed for the winter, but I would recommend taking advantage of the drink special and then hitting the sites.",

For all the people giving it one and two stars, i am assuming they were expecting way too much out of this place. It's basically a restaurant that specialized in bar food. Mostly Mexican dishes but there are other options. Realistically you're in Vegas, do you want to spend hours in a restaurant? No! You want to get your food quick so you can get back out and enjoy the strip!   We were seated inside but we actually ended up moving outside after we ate. The outside patio is definitely a party atmosphere, where as the inside is a little more reserved.  Our server was very nice and recommenced items to us when we asked what the budget options were!   The prices were all reasonable and the food was good. We will definitely go back here on our trip next year.",

There was a pretty decent size bar outside as well with seats that looked like various sexy legs. I thought this was fun and a cool picture opportunity. It was breakfast time when I went service was fast and there was plenty of open tables. This place is connected to the Flamingo hotel for reference.  For the food I got a breakfast burrito with potatoes. It was average breakfast food. They also had five dollar Bloody Mary's and Mimosas. I tried the blood mary. Nothing fancy served in a plastic cup but not bad again average. I'd say it's worth a try if your staying at the flamingo or close by but nothing to go out of your way for.",

I think they are trying to serve Baja style food. It wasn't even close!  First off, the food is overpriced for what you get. It's like every entree is about $18 and the food is terrible!   Chips and salsa are $8! The salsa was bland! A slice of white bread has way more flavor! They bring the chips in a bag and give you bland salsa! I was so hungry that i paid $8 for chips and bland salsa! I'm a fool!  On top of that, the service was below average and terrible! It was everything that you hope doesn't happen when you dine out: waiting and waiting and having to ask for the check, dirty dishes not cleared away, having to ask for a refill, etc.   Terrible overpriced food with crummy service.",

I started with a raspberry margarita and it was sweet like I prefer it to be and I really enjoyed the cocktail.  For my meal I opted for the Quesadilla Charlie's.  I have never seen a quesadilla so thick. These have chicken, carne asada, and chorizo with cheese.  It was delicious and I ate way too much of it, but enjoyed every bit of it.  I would go back to order it again today if I was closer now that I am thinking about them again! :-)  Our service was acceptable and attentive and we all enjoyed our meals.",

    "text": "Second day in Vegas and I slept in after a late late night. When I woke up I was in the mood for some lunch. I had seen this place on the way to my room the first night and I wanted to try it so I decided that was the time. I went in and was greeted right away by the host. I have some pictures with him. He was totally adorable and his accent was so cute. He was very friendly and made me feel welcome. He got me something to drink right away. My waitress was also very attentive and friendly.   I ordered the shrimp tacos and I have to say they were very good. I can see from the other reviews that the food leaves something to be desired but in my opinion the shrimp tacos are a good choice. They were actually pretty big and had alot of flavor. I had to get a to go box because I couldn't finish all of them. I also ordered a cup of tortilla soup. That, unfortunately, was not good at all. It had no flavor and the menu said it had cheese, well where was it because I sure didn't taste any. Tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups and I have had it in many different places but this one was probably the worst. I will admit that the food is very pricy but at the same time Vegas restaurant prices are always inflated.   My overall experience having lunch there was good and I will be back.   I had another experience here at night. They had a 2 for 1 drink special going on and I just kind of wandered in at the spur of the moment. There was a group of Puerto Rican people there dancing. I went in to see what that was about and next thing I know they are pulling over to them to dance with them. I ended up with a margarita in each hand and dancing with these people all night. I had a blast. They kept the drinking coming and the music going. If you come with some fun people this place can be a fun place to party at. The margaritas were not the best I ever had but they were sufficient. I was more caught in the dancing.",

The food isn't authentic Mexican food at all, but the taste isn't that horrible. So why the 2 stars? The portions are too small, the price is too high and the service isn't the best.   At first our waiter was pretty chill, but after taking our order we didn't see too much of him after. I guess the only good thing was that he gave us a margarita for free since he made a mistake.   Food: I ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice. Everything was seasoned pretty well, but I wish it had more of a kick to it. Also, I honestly could have probably ate 2-3 plates since the portion really wasn't that large...  Overall, I'm glad I tried Carlos 'n Charlie's one time, but I most likely won't be back.

After looking at the menu a couple members of our party ordered some appetizers to hold them until the buffet opened and drinks, A small bag of Chips and Canned Salsa $7.00, come on it's a bar, you want people to drink give them some free chips and Salsa (Bartending 101) but no this place gouges you for $7.00 for chips. A small Cheese Quesadilla $14.00, again only double the price of any other Mexican restaurant.

Food only took about 15 min and for a total of $30 it was a way better deal than the buffets!!  We had a Belgian waffle, 2 huge pancakes, 2 scrambled eggs, 2 slices of bacon, and breakfast potatoes! It was delicious and we could not even eat it all!  Would I highly recommend this over the pricey buffets to get full and eat fast!",

It was a very hot day in August and even though it was about 8:00 p.m., it was still very warm out.  Still the hostess asked if we wanted to sit outside on the deck.  She mentioned it was cold in the restaurant as the AC was blasting.  We sat outside and it was surprisingly refreshing. It was warm but there were some fans buzzing nearby.  It was also very quiet as the late night party crowd had not yet arrived.  Service was good.  They have a happy hour that begins at 9:00 and when I told my waiter that I wanted to wait until that time to order drinks, he kindly reminded me when the time approached.  I cannot remember what my friend ordered but I had a burrito that had chicken, beef and chorizo.  It was wonderful, not too spicy but full of flavor.",

I wasn't impress with my dish. I got the Charles burrito. Comes with side of rice and beans. To add guacamole it was $1.99, and honestly it was sooooo tiny for that price.

I really (really) like the Baja shrimp tacos. It's really good with extra chipotle Baja sauce. My husband gets something different every time. He's not a big fan of the chimichangas, but had one the burgers and really liked it. We enjoyed the outside seating and there was a magician and a balloon maker walking around. Waiter was friendly and great. We had long islands and margaritas. Really nice on a spring eve. I'm sure they have happy hour, and open pretty early for breakfast.",

My husband and I ordered gucamole and drinks. The guac was made table side, which was cool, but the guac literally consisted of a single avocado, a tiny cup of tomatoes and onions. We had probably 2/3 bag of chips left by the time we finished our microscopic portion of guac. The drinks were a fair portion but tasted like almost no alcohol had been added to the slush. While we were eating, a photographer came by to take our picture. When I said I didn't want to buy the photo, she pressured us by insisting multiple times she could give us a better price and that we should really take it. A magician came by and, while he was talented and interesting, guilted us about a tip. For just arriving in Vegas, it felt very much like a tourist trap.",

We had a group of 4 and were seated after a very short wait.     Our server was quick to take everyone's drink order, the margaritas and mojitos were on point!        The Nichols were a mountain of chips and cheeses. I was a little disappointed with the amount of other toppings that came with them, we asked and our server and he happily brought us more toppings.       Our entrees all tasted amazing! I had Enchiladas de mole, the sauce was chocolatey and rich. The burrito bowl looked good as well the steak fajitas are another winner. The price wasnt cheap but I believe with the quality of food and service it was fair.      We were also lucky enough to be entertained with a few magic tricks from Michael.",

I should've checked yelp before we did because it is disgusting food and poor service. I mean, I'm sure if you're there just to drink, it's probably fine, but that's where it ends. The enchiladas were VERY bad. Tasted like canned sauce. The rice tasted like the kind you get in a bag from the grocery and microwave. Not even close to being \"authentic\" mexican food. Just a joke. My friends food was half cooked, half wet. Yeah, gross. The Coke machine was flat and when I asked for another, I never got it. We waited 15 minutes and then finally just told them to forget it. Again, DO NOT EAT HERE.",

I ate here twice during the week I was in Vegas because we had two Groupons to use among our group.  Food was quite tasty but they have very little on the menu that is vegetarian friendly.  How a Mexican restaurant doesn't have veggie fajitas or bean burritos or the like is beyond me.  They did have a great ensalada with apples, goat cheese, and walnuts but that doesn't scream Mexican to me.  In any case, it was good enough to eat twice.  The appetizer nachos were decent as was the tableside guac.  Both times we ate here everyone liked what they ordered.  They have 2 for 1 margaritas during happy hour as well as half price Smirmoff martinis for Thursday ladies night.  The ambiance is fun and the servers are upbeat and friendly when you can find them.  Expect a long wait for drinks, food, refills, the bill....  Prices are a little high but you can expect that seeing as it's Vegas.  You do save a little if you are a Total Rewards member.  Worth eating at if you are staying at the Flamingo and don't mind slow service.",

A couple rounds later we were wondering where our server was because he hadn't been to our table for about 30 or more minutes.  He FINALLY came by ad said his shift was ending.  She since we work in service industry we offered to close out with him and ordered another round from the new server.  We never saw our 1st server again.  We waited 20 minutes and asked where our beers were.  He said I will be right back with them...what kind of beers are you drinking again(we had a few empty bottles of the same beer on the table already).  Ordered the same beer again and waited for another 30 minutes.  Finally once we got our beers we closed out.  $95 tab..which is expected for the strip but with THAT service it should have been comped.  We then went to the bar which was a great experience.  So if you want to get decent service go to the bar......but needless to say I don't want to go back.",

This is not the kind of place you go to for a serious meal, it's a bar with food for god's sake. The gin and tonics were great and there is no way to mess up a beer - bottle or draft. The service was good and the guacamole an chips were just that, but it was a nice touch to have the waiter whip up the guacamole at the table. The place is noisy with numerous TVs conveniently placed throughout the place, but hey it's a bar not a place you go to for a romantic dinner or a first class meal. It is what it is and this is what I liked about this place. Let me add that I have been to other locations of this chain both in the US and Mexico and they are all very similar - decent bar food, a bit pricy, and a good place to park your bod for a few minutes or hours to people watch.",

When asked about happy hour drinks he was extremely standoffish. Once we received our margaritas the bill came to $16 for 2 (2 for 1)  but their margaritas are watered down & definitely not worth the money. After sitting here for 30 minutes & noticing how friendly \"Kush\" was to other patrons the only common denominator was that we were African American & everyone else he greeted & checked in on was White. He didn't even look at us one time! Sitting with two empty cups at a bar & not being asked how was it, do you need anything else, or anything at all is not something you get from this place. Definitely bring your money elsewhere.",

Don't come here planning on getting chips and salsa when you sit down at the table because that's extra. The quesadilla was the worst I've ever had. The tortilla was SOAKED in grease and there were very few fillings. The tortilla soup didn't come with any chicken at all, just corn, beans, and what looked and tasted like canned broth - DISGUSTING.  Everything is completely overpriced it's not even funny.

While I was there with my fiance and in-laws, we were entertained by our bubbly waitress and her ability to keep the atmosphere lighthearted with wit and slap-stick humor. The service started out great and even the guacamole was legit. It was all fun and games until the food arrived. My mother in law ordered a taco salad; the meat looked disgusting on it and surely when everyone started making tacos they started to chew a gamey sort of meat that tasted and smelled foul. We were all really disgusted and grossed out by the meat; my mother in law went into the restroom and vomited. We told the server about it and she did try to get our bill reduced, but $6.50 off the bill didn't assauge our grief, so we literally waited there for over a half hour watching their incompetent staff go through all of the motions to try and deny our request to get the item pulled off of our bill. After being firm and refusing to pay for it they succumbed to our request. At this point, everyone was in such a bad mood and although our server tried her best, we felt the food was way too overpriced to have this kind of thing to be happening.  This place is not inexpensive by any means, and for the price I was expecting top-tier Mexican food. The quesadilla I had reminded me of cafeteria food and though I ate it, I wouldn't have paid $10 for it had I known it would be mediocre at best. In addition, their margaritas were a rip off! $11 for 2 dinky margaritas which I presumed had a splash of alcohol in them at best.  Don't be fooled by this place; they have an ambiance that reaches out and grabs the party-going vacationers that are looking for a good time and rests on the ignorance of passerbys that have no idea of what awful food they're about to get. If this place wasn't so transient, they would no longer be in business!",

All we wanted was a good lunch outside on a patio and that seemed too difficult for this place to deliver. When we went to leave,  I let the hostess know we received no service and it seemed to not have really mattered. I've been in the food industry as a bartender for 8 years, and this was one of the worst experiences I've had. I know the 20 minutes sounds like an exaggeration because that's what customers do, especially when hungry, but I only knew because we started actually paying attention to the time tick away. I would never ever recommend this place to anyone, in fact I would go out of my way to tell people not to go there. Get it together Carlos, this is Vegas. Step up your game a bit. But then again, because it is Vegas, they don't have to care about one persons review because people will go there no matter what because of the name. Unfortunate for those future customers.",

I could have gone to taco bell and got more food. And on top of that, my fiance ordered a cheese quesadilla, the dumbass waiter brought out steak. We told him he had made a mistake but we'll take it anyway because we were hungry. He charged us for steak. But what drove me crazy is the drink prices, my god what a f'n ripoff. I realize its vegas but im not buying a large pitcher for $39.00. And if that waiter still works there, hes a total idiot. Kept on asking why we weren't drinking and was getting annoyed with us. Im assuming its because they get a commission for drink sales. $44 for 3 tacos, a cheese quesadilla, and water. If i could rate no stars i would. THIS PLACE SUCKS, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.",

In fact, I actually looked forward to going! I had the enchiladas, rice and beans. Everything was extremely flavorful and in good portions. To be honest I wished there had a BIT more red sauce, but that's a minor thing. The nachos looked great as well. As did the cheese dip. There is Happy Hour everyday from 2-6 and anytime football is on the screen. That is really the time to come. I enjoyed sitting outside and chatting with other guests around the bar. Everyone was friendly. TIP: When you come here and there is any issue whatsoever with your food, drinks or service, ask immediately to speak with Amy. I had the pleasure of getting to know Amy and beyond any doubt, she is extremely capable of handling any situation. And she will do it with a smile and a pleasant demeanor. If owned a restaurant, I would want her working for me. I promise you that Amy will make it right.",

They should be embarrassed of their chips/salsa/guacamole...the salsa was definitely poured straight from a jar of salsa they bought at Walmart, and the \"table side guacamole\"?!..might as well just bring your own avocado to chomp on and save yourself $10...another standard Mexican side dish you wouldn't think anyone could mess up..rice and beans! My beans looked like the poop emoji on the iPhone and the rice was a real crapshoot..my fiance's rice randomly had green peas in it? So that was interesting.... And then the service..our waitress had no idea what any drink or lunch specials were...we had to convince her that there even were lunch specials by walking to the front of the restaurant and taking a picture of the display that listed them. The ONLY reason they got one star is because they did at least offer drink and food specials throughout the day (and because yelp makes you give at least one star..haha).

Last year, this place was under construction, and we were pleased to find it finished this year and were excited about trying it out.  We were there on a Saturday night, a bit on the later side, and right away I should have turned and left because the music in the place was just incredibly LOUD.  I'm no fuddy-duddy but to have to lean over and SCREAM to be heard is just not my cup of tea.  My fault there - even the waitress thought it was really loud and asked the DJ to notch it down. We thought the food was good - we had the bean soup, and steak tacos.  But there were none of the usual \"extras\" offered such as crackers for the soup.  We basically had to beg for some carbs!    Prices were a few dollars higher than they should have been.  Many of the items are slightly discounted if you have your players card with you. I thought our server did a decent job.  Clearly she did not have a lot to work with. When we go back next year I will give this place one more try.",

Waitress brought us only two waters when there was three of us, and we had to ask her to bring the missing water.  Took forever to get the bill, refills, anything really.  Very poor service.",

However the meal arrived before the appetizer did, so we sent it back and asked for the appetizer to be serve.  The guacamole was actually pretty good.  However it appears that they just took our entrees that they served us before the appetizer and just warmed them back up after 20 minutes.   The ceasars salad was sooggy and the chicken quesidilla was just plain old.   The food is overpriced to begin with so thank god we had a groupon.   If you want a great mexican dinner at a reasonable price go to Mi Casa in the Silverton Hotel!!",

When it came to pay for some of the meals that weren't covered by the voucher, the server charged us for one too many.  When we protested, she refused to go back to check her records.

I echo everyone's sentiments that this is one of the worst dining choices you could ever make. This place is so horrible it needs to be called out.  I dined there on 11/12/2012. I was with a some people and we just wanted to take a break from gambling and get a bite to eat and some drinks before heading to another casino. Huge mistake.  While we were seated right away and the waitress took our drink orders, we didn't see our drinks (or our waitress) for a good twenty minutes. Eventually, some guy showed up (who was not our server) to take our dinner orders.   I should also mention the atmosphere. If you're planning to eat in the dining section, don't plan on talking to anyone around you. The music is blaring and you'll have to shout at each other. I've also never seen a group of wait staff pretending to have so much fun. I almost felt sad for them. And the kicker was when they started offer free tequila shots at the bar with a bartender pretending to be Tom Cruise in Cocktail. I've never seen a bar/restaurant try so hard and so epically fail.  As for the food, save your money (and most importantly your time) and go to Taco Bell. It's actually much, much better. And I eat at Taco Bell maybe once a year. I got the carne asada tacos which were the blandest thing ever. I heaped every condiment I could find on them and they were still awful. I thought about ordering the special guacamole appetizer which is made at your table but decided against it. Thank god.  After you've eaten, prepare to spend another 30-45 minutes waiting for the check. We actually had to get up to find our waitress and request it. She smiled, laughed, flipped her hair, and said \"Sure, I'll be right back.\" She did show up and take the credit card but apparently duty called elsewhere. She had to prepare the \"special guacamole appetizer\" for another table. Apparently the \"special recipe\" is something they share with their wait staff and make them do it. Another fifteen minutes go by and we're starting to wonder what she did with the credit card. We had to flag down another wait person to ask if our waitress was coming back.  Eventually, she showed up. She was all happy and perky. And oblivious. Much like this restaurant.",

We stayed in the Flamingo for a week and we were on a trip with lots of co-workers so I ended up having more than one experience here even though under normal circumstances I wouldn't have been back after the first time.  We stopped by at the end of our first night in LV to grab one more drink with a friend before heading to our room and decided on frozen margaritas. ( Let me start with 3 important facts: 1) I LOVE margaritas. 2) I enjoy sour things so much that I will happily peel a whole lemon or grapefruit like its and orange and eat it with no sugar. 3) We had quite a bit to drink at this point and weren't in any state to be picky.)  The margaritas were so mouth-twistingly bitter and sour that none of the three of us could get one down.  The next time I came they had some sort of all yo can drink thing going on.  Problem was, no one that worked there knew the rules.  We were originally sold a line about how you can come and go as much as you want and bring your drinks.  But every time they fought us about it making up rules about needing to get a new cup and then rules about having to have the same cup.  On top of all that, the latin techno that was playing was so loud that we were all sitting around the table texting eachother because you couldn't hear the person right next to you even when they screamed at the top of their lungs.   Beware of this place because they wander through the casino trying to sell you on $20 all you can drink tickets.",

    "text": "We have eaten here many times when we go to Vegas, and we're there once a month, I would say every other month we eat there. Food is always good and fresh. However, service is usually somewhat slow, but we go back as we like the food. This last weekend I ordered a fajita salad that I thought was very overpriced what what I received, overcooked dry chicken on a bed of romaine with 3 slices of tomato, a 1/4 avocado and a few slivers of red onions. It didn't appear to have any dressing on it either.   Our server wasn't around, however, I noticed the mgr. Yaixel \"Cuba\", I asked him to help me as I was sooooo disappointed with what I received, he offered to make me a new one, but I opted to have what my husband had since I started sharing his meal and it was delish, a Charlies burrito. He came back shortly thereafter with a new entree, discounted the check, and did it all with such genuineness and a smile. I could tell he truly cared about my dining experience, what a breathe of fresh air that was!! All to often, servers and managers on the strip do not care about what they serve you or how they serve you as most ppl are there on vacation and only visit once. Cuba had such a great attitude while working, having fun with customers and he is very authentic, I really appreciate that and will come back for sure! The only reason for 4 stars is that the servers need to also care about the job they are doing.  On a sidenote, the kids menu is priced extremely well, great portions and it comes with a drink and dessert. They may not have mexican food on the kids menu, but it works for us.",

Took a bit to get someone to take our order and the manager was in the neighborhood, so he took the order.    Started off with the ceviche and tortilla chips.  The ceviche is very bland and almost no flavor at all as it has tiny pieces of cod mixed in with tons of tomatoes, bits of onions and a few thin slices of avocado.   If you like bland ceviche, you will love it, if you like flavor add some Cholula or Tabasco hot sauce.    Also ordered the fajitas and came with a tiny portion size for $20.  The steak was flavorful and tender and the chicken was good as well.    Tried a sample of their margaritas and they were either too sweet or had too much lime.   I like a good strong margarita and these were too off the chart for me to order. Guess I'm used to the best frozen margarita in the land at Ztejas, in Costa Mesa, Ca.    Overall, the meal wasn't bad, but far from parable or great.  The service aspect of this restaurant definitely needs to be addressed, but I wouldn't expect any changes in the near future.  If you are not in a hurry and don't mind waiting, then it might work for you here.  If not, I would move on down the road for something quicker and tastier.",

This place is a dump and honestly is 100% because of the stank attitude from the management and wait staff. Even the security team were complaining about him and encouraged us to call corporate on the establishment. It's sad when the casino doesn't even want to be associated with this place.

The last couple times we've made sure to stop at Carlos and Charlie's for cocktails.  We always have a great time. To be honest the food is pretty mediocre, but we love to just sit at the bar and drink margaritas. We've been lucky enough to catch Omid on nights that he's tending the bar and he always takes care of us. Most strip bartenders are dicks unless your a single girl, but this guys is great. We are looking forward to our next weekend away.",

Myself and girlfriend stopped by to grab a late night snack before hitting the strip it was around 10 PM so for Vegas standards still pretty early. The restaurant was already in full club mode with the music cranked but no customers, we were first seated at a booth but the music was so loud we couldn't hear each other so we asked to be seated out on the patio. The waiter said the host would be right with us but that never happened so we headed to the patio since there were other patrons and staff out there just to be stopped by security who told us we weren't allowed to sit outside at this point we dropped the menus on a table and headed out. Just hard to believe they would turn down two paying customers just to make the dining room look busy. The food that people had on the tables looked pretty good.",

The jalapeno marg was just ok should be an infused simple syrup to excrete as much jalapeno flavor as possible not just spice with bits of pepper in it . Our server brought my marg and it was the wrong size ( so had to wait another 15 minutes for the correct size which I ended up having to go up to the bar )  Our food arrived and the reccomended entree(chicken parm) was bland and served with IQF ( individually quick frozen) frozen potatoes DO NOT ORDER the nachos were good but I would recommend layering chips with toppings . The queso and salsa appetizer were amazing though very yummy. The food was really over priced I don't care if it is las Vegas.  The service is what really is why I won't go back. Being a professional in the food service industry I would say dont go to this place and pay $250 dollars and expect amazing food and awesome service",

We noticed immediately that there was something weird about the table--it was huge [we couldn't touch hands with our backs against the seats, which isn't conducive to conversations], it came up to the middle of my chest, and it curved. Boyfriend thought the table was just warped, but all the booths were like that! My silverware kept sliding off my plate and into the middle of the table, so we moved.   The food was fine. I wasn't like blown away by the burrito packed with cheese and veggies. Skip the guacamole--it's super oily. Our beers were served in giant margarita glasses, which I kinda liked.   The service wasn't great. She didn't come by very often and we never got water. It also took quite a while to get the bill.  We were back in here an hour later because Boyfriend's group of pals showed up. This time we were seated on the patio. The nachos are ridiculously huge, which seems like something that they would point out in the menu. They're definitely meant for sharing as an appetizer and not for a single person to sit down and eat! Haha, it was a mountain of chips, real cheese, nacho cheese, and meant. The 2-for-1 margaritas were decent [strawberry was VERY strong, but I couldn't taste much alcohol in the mango so perhaps it hid the flavor].   Our waitress didn't come by very often and we had to go chase after her to get more drinks and our bills. When one of the guys in the group went to go talk to a manager about it, he was given an it's-not-my-problem response.   Oh, and apparently this place turns into a weird night club. We sent a friend through [she reported back as it being partially filled with mostly dudes] and decided to go elsewhere.",

On the topic of bartenders, the younger guy and girl that were serving were very friendly and even helped me get open bar price (it was an open bar for ladies night). Service was great.  The bar also had an actual dj playing the music which is always a plus.

But we had already sit down so we decided to stay and eat. The chimi was recommended by the waiter so we ordered. Very heavy. Lots of onions. Expensive and drinks are basically water.

There was only one bartender and it took him about 5 minutes to even realize we were sitting there. He finally came over and we ordered right away, chicken nachos. While the plate was full it took about 40 minutes for them to come out. Nachos are a pretty simple dish it shouldn't take that long. They were just OK and again the bartender never checked on us, didn't even try to sell us any drinks. We had to call him over to take our payment and when we did he just came over and said \"yea what's up?\" I expect a little more professionalism when I'm trying to pay my tab. He had is back to us the entire time we could have walked out without even paying. By the way they were $25 and NOT worth it!",

The music was playing and the food was good and the service was AMAZING! We had Peyton as our server and we loved him! To be honest he made my birthday so much more fun! And he took care of us and his customer service is exceptional! I've been in customer service line of work for over 12 years and he is just phenomenal! Thank you Peyton! I can't thank you enough for everything. We loved it so much we went everyday we were there sometimes twice. There was a table behind us one afternoon asking the waiter where Peyton was haha. So we're not the only ones who feel this way. Even better Peyton's twin brother Jason is an employee there and yes!! He is just as great! He was just as attending as Peyton and did everything he could to make sure we had exceptional service! Carlos n Charlie's you guys have gems on your hands! Please recognize these two amazing men! And thank you again guys for the memories!",

We went because my friend was staying at the Flamingo, so it was conveniently located.  Food was overall good, though a bit pricey: $17 for 3 carne asada tacos.  $1.90 for a small container of guacamole seemed high, too.  It looked like less than an ounce.  Tropical atmosphere was kind of cool outside (thankfully it was nice outside).  Biggest issue I had was with service.  Our waitress didn't seem that friendly, and when we finally got our food, we still didn't have any silverware.  She brought 2 and had to get a 3rd, but it's just a detail like that that's annoying.    Just wasn't impressed by the place.  Food was the best part, but definitely not my first choice on the Strip.  I'd probably try something new next time I eat at the Flamingo.",

We tried to dress it up by adding the salsa, but the salsa just made it colder (it lumped) and more blah.!! The quesadilla was supposed to have carne asada , chorizo and chicken...well, you fooled me. Just stay away. How can you make tasteless chorizo - seriously.

They do a really nice job of creating a fun vibe inside, and on the patio.  We went in for a late dinner and by the time we left, the outside patio looked like a nightclub.  Everyone was dancing, they had girls dancing on the bars, people coming around with shots.  I found all the servers and bar tenders to be over-the-top friendly as well.  The manager Genero (sp?) personally came by our table twice to check on us and make sure we were ok.  Who knows.. maybe they're really trying to up their service because of all their negative reviews on Yelp!!  I also think that, considering you're on the Vegas strip, the value is pretty good.  The portions were huge, and the prices weren't ridiculous.  Plus who doesn't like to get one of those giant plastic yards of alcohol, walk the Strip, and be a drunk tourist for a day.  This place is ok in my book.  Give it a shot.",

Placed our meal order of a chicken and cheese burrito and enchiladas.   The server said guacamole on the side and I said yes because I thought they would put it all over, but no, it is a $2 charge.   Annoying that I wasn't told.     Both meals were nice and hot, but lacked any sauce so they were extremely dry.  The Spanish rice was good  I am thinking that $75 for what we had was pricey.   The marguerites were $11 each. Ouch!  Overall, really not worth the money.",

Now I used to drink, especially when I would come down to Vegas, and I've drank in plenty of places outside of Utah, so I know I good drink. Quite possibly the drink was weak due to the fact that we all got wristbands for this place, and for a $25 cover, it was all the domestics and well drinks you wanted, with the ability to come and go as you please. I watched my friends down probably 5 of the frozen margaritas and at least 2 buds each, and neither was even slightly buzzed. I'm pretty sure that the frozen margarita mix MIGHT have a shot per serving, but the taste was good from my little but I had.  As far as the atmosphere...eh. It definitely attracts some of the lower quality, and probably the more frugal people in Vegas, and they allow people to enter who are wearing sweats, so that should give enough of a picture of the majority of the crowd that comes in. The people dancing seemed to be enjoying themselves though! A lot of top 40, which seemed weird because it has more of a Mexican or western style feel. All in all, this isn't a place I would plan to return to, but with the kind of drink special they have, and for being inside one of the lower end Strip hotels (the Flamingo), I definitely see why/how this place is the way it is.",

Chicken quesadillas, burritos, chunky salsa, Cadillac margaritas; all to perfection! We will definitely make this a \"go to place\" on our return trips to Vegas and no doubt, we will request Gelbert! 5 stars all the way",

Service was horrible, food was average, order was wrong when delivered.  Had a concern of why a hot cup of water cost more than Bacon , was asked if I wanted a manager I said yes.  Server returned with bill adjusted by $4. And rudely said   \"this is your bill the Manager has no Explanation\"  And walked away .  Properly attired, was in town to host /dj the 11th annual dance convention so guess who had lots of money?  Flown in from Philadelphia to dj in Vegas last 10 years, 99 problems money ain't 1.  So why did I get blown off? Any guess? Might be my tan.  Spoke with hotel management they emailed but that's not really a solution, people that have tans should stay away our money isn't welcome   New to help should be no stars at all",

The randomness is truly awesome, including a massive cow wearing pink cowboy boots hanging above the bar. I don't know what it means. I don't think anyone knows what it means. But, it's there's and those that notice it, get to wonder why!?  As for the food, it is unseasoned, uninspired, and boring, boring, boring. Two for one frozen margaritas from a machine, on the other hand, where pretty darn tasty.   So, I'd come in during happy hour, skip the other three people who will be there even though the place easily seats over one hundred, and stare in wonderment at the random paraphernalia. It's worth a star in my as yet undefined Yelp review scale from dreadful to awesome.",

It came out pretty quickly even though we were antsy. The Ceviche was served with chips, which were kinda stale but I'm not picky. Just thought I'd throw that in there for future diners. Anyway, I don't know if it was because we were in a rush, if we were hungry, or if we genuinely thought it was good. I mean, it was good but for the price, maybe not. They should probably consider bringing the price down a little bit LOL. Their drinks are really overpriced though, $3.75 for a grande sized soda. Our bill for the Ceviche and two drinks was $27. YOWZA! I'd probably not go back, but I have nothing really bad to say about the place.",

    "text": "Unfortunately my wife choose this joint based on a discount we had. Being homesick from Texas we were craving some street tacos. Jess got the Carne Asada on Flour and they seemed ok.. wait wait let me back up a bit.  We ordered drinks which were mediocre Jess a frozen margarita and I a mojito along with chips and salsa. Frozen margarita was as expected not amazing, mojito was not muttled at all, whole mint leaves etc., and light on the tequila. The salsa was fire roasted northern Cali sweet salsa style, slightly bland; chips were thick fresh and very good. Meaning they tasted like corn tortilla chips should, thick cut, not oily and the oil they were cooked in was obviously clean and not overheated or burnt. Food arrived quickly but the first thing I noticed was the \"Charlie's\" (mixed chicken, carne and Chorizo) I ordered we're on single corn tortillas. Tip: any street tacos worth eating on corn will have to be doubled to hold together because they aren't as pliable as flour. These didn't fall apart but the meat was minced, each meat was unrecognizable from the other. I thought it may all be the same and certainly all had the exact same flavor. Biggest issue was my first bit was similar to a chalky over cooked minced meat. Very over cooked. I liberally applied the hot sauce provided with the dish. It didn't help the dryness at all. I then addressed the beans and rice, mine was Charro style beans and white rice. The white rice was long grain but sticky like sushi rice and had dried out corn carrots and Lima beans in it. The chart beans were cooked well but no flavor or spice at all.  Mixed together with the hot sauce it was ok. After two bites of the bean and rice mix and two bites out of 1 of the 3 tacos I was unwilling to accept this. Jess doesn't complain and was hungry so she ate a few more bites yet confirmed my assessment.   So Roberto our waiter was very polite and attentive, I explained the issue when he came by and he took the plate offering me a replacement, I de lined and just said I didn't want another dish if it was going to be the same quality, he apologized. The manager came through shortly later not to address my concern but to retrieve Jess's plate. I wasn't going to go any further but he saw she only ate half and being we were not typical drunk or wasted Vegas visitors his face shown of his embarrassment. I explained as I did Roberto and he replied the corporate chef was here and he had just addressed the \"dryness\" of the Charlie's tacos. He politely dismissed the rice stating it was show they served the dish, (sticky). I picked at a piece of Jess's and a large skin from the outside picked up attached. I also pointed out the dried out veggies in the rice. They should revisit the white rice. In the end we ordered a second round of drinks and Jess let Roberto know we hadn't gotten the Guacamole she ordered with her tacos. He again was very polite and said all the good was comped, I didn't request this but it's the right thing to do. I retired for a Father's Day call with Abby, Isa and Analeigh. Jess said they were very polite so if there is a saving grace I suppose it's that the managers and severs at this location are top notch with customer service. I will also say that we were maybe an hour after lunch rush and perhaps we got the scraps!? Regardless any meat like carne or chicken and pork chorizo that's minced is gonna dry out!!!",

It offers overpriced, mediocre Americanized food...with a small discount if you show your Total Rewards card. Alas, the savings did not help. It was a bomb on so many levels.   Service: our server was sweet but slow and managed to get so much wrong. I ordered a Pepsi, got a diet, and despite my almost empty glass and her eagerness to refill my husband's water at least 4 times, I never got a refill. Given that the soda was $3.50, ugh.   She forgot to bring my soup and when we reminded her, she smiled and said she would take it off the check. Boo.   My chicken fajita salad was tasty. Basic, no complaints. Hubby had BBQ shrimp and did not like the spicy sauce or the bacon garnish.   We splurged and bought the chips and salsa...nothing like a paper bag of stale chips and jarred salsa to convince us we'd made a grande mistake. The noisy atmosphere and thumping soundtrack sort of topped things off.   One of the worst meals I've ever had in Vegas...live and learn.",

    "text": "The food is okay.  I ate there last night with my girlfriend and four of her friends.  I had the shrimp burrito.  I wasn't spectacular, but it was okay.  It was not worth the $19 I paid for it, but those are Strip prices.  My main reason for the two star rating is their unwillingness to accommodate their customers.  Apparently, they have a policy of not doing separate checks. There were six of us at our table, most of us using credit cards to pay.  The waitress basically said we had to figure out how much each of us owed and she could run each card one at a time, subtracting what we told her from the bill each time.  After ten minutes of trying to figure out the bill and how we would deal with the tax we finally got the manager and complained about the policy.  He ultimately agreed to do it for us and it took another ten minutes to separate everything in their computer with one of the members of our party helping him sort out the bill.  I have worked in three different restaurants in the past, not to mention have eaten in dozens of restaurants here in Vegas and never have I had a restaurant tell me they won't do separate checks.  Las Vegas is a top tourist destination in the entire world.  People come here in groups.  Why on earth would any restaurant have a policy like that in a city like this?  It defies logic and it's extremely inconvenient.  As someone who has waited tables and bartended in the past I do understand how annoying it can be to be asked to split a check for a large group at the end of the meal, but our waitress was asked up front and I didn't even show up until everyone else had finished eating so my check should have been easy to split off.   I was not happy about us having to jerk around with this for twenty minutes when we were ready to leave.  Change your policy, folks.",

    "text": "**Open Bar Review Only** 1/1/17 2AM. We were walking around New Year's Day on the strip when two guys from Carlos and Charlie waived us down and told us to check out the open bar night to open up the New Years. It was $25 per person and you had 1hr open bar. So we walked over to the Carlos and Charlie and the music was going but we couldn't see inside. Screw it we decided to go in. As you walk in they hand you a plastic Dixie cup and tell you to hold on to it or there will be a fee for a new cup.  That was weird as it was. We walk in and there is about 30 people just standing around listening to the DJ. The dance floor was all wet from people spilling there drinks on it. The reason why I gave it one star and wish I could've gave it negative stars was because of what they were serving behind the bar. All the bottles behind the bar were bottom shelf generic imitation bottles. The worst of the worst. All the bottles on the back shelf were not being served. They weren't part the open bar. They had a few beers on tap. I asked for IPA and they told me NO. I asked for Bud Light and they said No. So I told him to give me whatever was included in the open bar. Disgrace of bartender come back with Natural Ice. Within that one hour of being there we decided we had enough. Dump of a place could keep the money, they needed it. About to walk out when security stops everyone who's leaving because a female slipped and busted her face open. Since there was blood everywhere we had to wait till they cleaned it up to exit. Place is a dump don't go here.",

Yeah, it comes out looking like Mt. Dew and tasting like sadness. They also have margarita slurpee machines and I'd probably have been better off going that way.   The food was your generic churned out Mexican. Think... well, the \"Mexican\" dishes at places like Chili's.   They get two stars because the ceviche was fantastic. I couldn't believe it came from the same place! As someone who has made ceviche at a fine dining restaurant, I know my ceviche, and it was spectacular. Lots of avocado, which is great. Even my husband, who isn't really a foodie, commented that the ceviche looked strikingly different from all the other dishes.  Bottom line: order the ceviche and stick with Dos Equis.",

    "text": "My visit to Carlos' n Charlie's was a pop-in so I'm not sure if a review is really stating the establishment's True colors.  I sat at the bar at 11:30AM and there were only a small handful of people lunch dining.      I ordered chips and salsa along with fish tacos.  The chip came in a To Go bag and it was a plentiful lot of chips... warm.  The salsa was mediocre but a large portion.  I liked the idea of a bag of chips as people visiting Vegas always need some snacks for later, in their room.      The fish tacos came out quickly to be expected given the small number of people there.  There were three and each was loaded with a healthy amount of what I would call chipotle coleslaw and breaded fish.  I think I wanted more fish but as I ate my way through the first two tacos I realized I was eating some pretty good food.  The tacos came with three small bowls each having a sauce (hot oily sauce, ranch and tartar sauce).  I dipped into all three throughout my meal and liked the oily hot sauce best).  My drink order was club soda with lime - no way that gets screwed up.      So what can I say but give an A-OK rating.  The food was served hot, tasty, quick and I had the place all to myself.  My bar keeper was a lovely tattoo'd specimen with a friendly smile - charming gal really.  Life was good for 45 minutes at least for me during my visit to Carlos' n Charlie's in FLAMINGO Vegas.",

    "text": "Abandon all hope ye who enter here.  Carlos n Charlie's is not charming. They do not have good food. They do not have good prices. The service is the turd on the top of this poop sundae; they straight up refused to let us split checks (between two parties) and scoffed at the idea of subbing a cheese enchilada for a meat enchilada on a multiple enchilada platter.  The Cadillac Margarita comes in a plastic cup and is made from swill and imitation lime swill. The guacamole shouldn't have been able to be bad (since it was made in front of us) but the guy forgot salt and pepper and hence it was immensely bland.  Sidenote: one of our party members passed out at the table immediately after consuming the above mentioned guacamole. I am 92% sure it was because she hadn't eaten all day but I want to leave open the possibility this place is poisoning it's guests because it wouldn't surprise me.  If the Paramedics or the Flamingo Security who responded to the above medical incident were Carlos n Charlie's staff this review would have more stars because their customer service was dramatically better than the actual employees.  As an alternative I recommend everywhere else in the world. Literally you could just knock on doors offering people money to cook you mexican food and I am certain the first person to accept you in would be able to cook you a finer meal with whatever they had on hand (and would likely agree to a much lower price) than this lousy embarrassment of a \"restaurant.\"",

    "text": "We were tired and didn't want to leave our hotel. Mistake number one. We forgot to check this place on yelp. Mistake number two. We convinced ourselves it was cool to pay $6 for chips and salsa cuz it was Vegas. Mistake number three.   If there is a law about misleading people into buying canned crushed tomatoes under the guise that they will receive salsa, then somebody at Carlos and Charlie's is in big trouble. I don't know what brand canned tomatoes we received but it wasn't good. That much I'm sure of.   Interesting choice on the presentation of chips, btw. I don't know who came up with the paper bag, with a staple in it, placed on a plate idea but I hope they were immediately promoted cuz that is innovation!  I would like to take a second to compliment the \"chef\" on the unique ability to overcook something while still managing to serve it cold. The fries were rock solid and slightly burnt yet cold all at once. No easy feat.  The beans were, I believed also from a can, but my Mexican friend took offense to that thought because as he explained it, even canned beans wouldn't be that dry. They were old he assured me. Probably sat out all day before making their way to me. Very appetizing.  I hated the rice but one person at my table liked it. Chimichanga was pretty terrible and McDonald's most definitely makes a better hamburger.  The prices are inflated but it's Vegas so it is to be expected but when we are paying $8 for two sodas, a single refill at any point during the 30 minutes the glasses sat empty would have been a nice bone thrown our way. Incidentally, my one star is for Pepsi. The beverages were far and away the highlight of this meal.  If you are smarter than we were and you've taken the time to check yelp, walk (or run) to a different hotel to eat. Trust me!",

They make cater to kids with balloon animals along with the entertainment of dancing the conga line or the shuffle. It truly is a blast! A must when visiting Vegas l.

I've eaten at some not so authentic Mexican restaunts and none can compare to this bastardization of what they call Mexican food. Do not go here. They're regular margaritas was horrible as well.

It reminds me of a Mexican themed SaddleRanch. Worth a visit.  Had an order of guac, and cheese dip. Both were pretty good. Also had margeritas at happy hour. If not for the HH pricing, it would have seemed to pricey for what you're getting. But there's definitely a quality for having outdoor space to hang out at during the evening.",

    "text": "I ate at this restaurant with my girlfriend because we had a Groupon and were on vacation.  Bad choice.  The restaurant feels like the TGI Friday's of Mexican restaurants and is ridiculously expensive for the quality, even for the strip.  Chips & salsa, guacamole, and cheese will cost you quite a bit extra for any meal choice.  Drinks are overpriced.  $4 for an iced tea?  Really?    Our service was terrible.  The waitress was nice up front but then disappeared for a good half hour after taking our order, as people from the kitchen brought out our food and appetizer.  Trying to get her to come back for drink refills was nearly impossible.  Bill for 2 entrees (I got tacos, my girlfriend had a burrito - nothing fancy), an iced tea, chips & queso, and an alcoholic beverage would have been upwards of $70 + gratuity without the groupon.  If the food is going to be way overpriced, it would have been nice if it was at least good, rather than mediocre.    Not worth it.",

    "text": "Not bad for me! Visited during Happy Hour (it was a Thursday afternoon around 4 pm) to take advantage of the 2 for 1 margaritas. Ordered 4 margaritas (3 passion fruit and one regular- server said passion fruit was the best) for our group of 5, as well as chips/ salsa and the banana chimichangas (recommended by our server). That's right, no free chips 'n' salsa here folks. I didn't eat the salsa but the banana chimichangas were awesome, and the portion size was definitely large enough to share. Margarita was good- I agree the passion fruit one's the thing, and with the buy one get one it's a good deal!  Atmosphere... kinda TGI Fridays I guess? Makes more sense when you know they are owned by the same company as Senor Frog's. We really liked our server... a youngish woman that wore a flower in her hair... don't remember her name.",

    "text": "We're two 50-somethings from Texas that spend a lot of time in Vegas.  Our Hilton timeshare abutts the Flamingo, so we were excited to see the addition of Carlos N Charlies this past winter.  The Flamingo has long needed a fun restaurant.  In the past, we liked to gamble there, but there was little reason to eat there.  Carlos N Charlies is trying to be fun...almost outrageous...and a great time.  Their outdoor bar is quite appealing.  Our first experience, on a Wednesday night at about 9 PM, was disappointing.  Right off the airplane, cold (and overcooked) burger, cold fries, cold (and overcooked) chicken tacos.  The next day, I respectfully spoke with the General Manager, Genaro Dispa.  Told him about our frequent Vegas visits, our ownership behind his bar, and how disappointed we were with the kitchen.  I told him that they had invested a lot of money to be in the middle of the action of The Linq, and that by tightening up his operation he could move from mediocre to fabulous.  He made everything right.  Took my information.  Took me to meet the chef.  Asked wifey and me to give them another chance....which we did.  Our second experience was 180 degrees different from our first.  Saturday night at about 7 PM.  A couple of parties in the house added a good vibe.  Superb wait staff.  And Genaro and chef greeted us and made sure we had a \"right\" experience.  The food was hot.  Drinks cold.  Atmosphere upbeat.  Well satisfied.  As Genaro and staff keep up the good work (and keep the kitchen and floor staff tight and attentive) Carlos N Charlies will be a go-to spot.",

    "text": "I got two Groupons and came here with my girlfriend to hang at the bar before a show. We ordered two GIANT pints of Dos Equis beer and guacamole. They prepare the guacamole fresh at your table. It was excellent. As a local, I know never to order frozen margaritas or daiquiris or what have you because they contain mostly sugar and hardly any booze. I recommend you get a beer instead. Besides, if you order a huge beer you don't have to worry about them coming by to refill it. I   would come back just to hang at the bar but probably not for the food since it gets such bad reviews. Not only that, but who orders Mexican food on the strip when there are amazing places that locals go to? Do your research, people!  Be prepared for loud music and the staff dancing on the bar and what not because it happens every night.  Friendly bartenders and staff!",

But sadly it was drenched with dressing. I got the dressing on the side plus a drenched salad! He took it off the bill and I spent the night starving. My husband said burrito was good but on the spicy side. This place lacks organization and is too pricey. Manager was MIA. We didn't ask for one but you can tell that they weren't there. The frozen margarita was way too tart and was presented in a beer glass. I couldn't even finish it. Waisted $$ on that one too. We tipped the waiter well regardless. But what a disappointment!",
