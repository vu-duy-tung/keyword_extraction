There was a gentleman (assuming he was the owner) come around to give us sushi samples.  I thought that was fantastic.  Everything tasted fresh.  Just wish they had a fountain for drinks.  Another bonus is they have stamp cards!  Great way to keep you returning.  Will definitely come back!",

I can't put a chopstick on it...but this place is superior to other similar establishments for some reason. Maybe it's the three kinds of rice, maybe it's the speciality bowls listed for the lazy or novice, maybe it's the nicely visible and organized ingredients? Regardless, I've been many times. You can get a fresh, satisfying and healthy meal for less than $10.   Great for kids too. They love picking the stuff out and the thrill of the build.   You should go. I'll be back. Cute inside and friendly service. They will give you direction if you are torn between sauces and even have good ideas for mixing them. Don't fear...just ask. Yum!",

Overall the food was good, but I've been spoiled by how great California poke bowl joints are that I set my expectation bar very high. Once again another Vegas joint falls below comparison.   Serving size was decent, but dwarfed by the others I've had before in California. Price was where I expected it to be. Quality was good and food tasted clean. Staff was cool. Didn't know if it was cool/weird that they served their poke in a frozen yogurt paper bowl, still contemplating.   Definitely give this place a shot and see how you like it, especially if you live close by.",

    "text": "I like this place a lot better than Pokeman. The menu was a bit confusing, so definitely take your time to read through it before you order. Its sort of like chipotle. Pick a size, then a base + protein + toppings + sauce. I got a small bowl with super white tuna (hardly any other place carries super white tuna!) and 2 scoops of salmon. Thanks to the yelp check in offer I got a free scoop of protein. I added crab meat, cucumber salad, a bunch of toppings and some ponzu sauce. You can ask for different sauces on the side if you want to add more to your bowl. The rice was perfectly cooked and the fish were very fresh. I guess I'm not a huge fan of super white tuna though, so next time I'll stick to more salmon.   I think a downside is that they only have bottled/canned drinks and the bowl was pretty small so I had a hard time mixing everything together.   There's a display case with different types of sushi rolls if bowls/salads/nachos aren't your thing. Can't wait to come back for lunch or dinner.",

When entering the place you will see this big wood thing in center of the place (don't know what it's called), you look to the left there is sushi and snacks. You go right you are at the front of ordering your food.  The menu is really visible and very straight forward so you can't mess up. The seating though was a little to clustered no space to put my son in a highchair.  After ordering and finally sitting down admiring how the poke bowl look it tastes even BETTER! Compared to other poke places I visited the first time, this is comes in my top 4.   Poke bowl is just right not too much not too little poke,rice and toppings. For being open only a couple weeks and having so many people rush on in when I was about leave was amazing. It was a full line inside but the servers seem to move really quick to keep the line to a minimum.   I highly recommend first timers to come here if you haven't.",

The smell made me feel relaxed and the indie designs made me want to check out more of the store. Inside, we could easily see the sushi display window on the left. All of the sushi looks fresh and delicious. The way they sell poke bowl is similar to how anyone orders food at Chipotle. The servers were really nice. I told them this was my first time here and they explained everything on the menu and also told me what is popular in the store right now. After they finished packing my food, they also walked out from the cashier and brought it to me.  Food Evaluation. After I got my food, I noticed the color of the fish in my bowl were bright and clear. I could tell how fresh it was from the color.  When I ate it, the fish was chewy and it was like I could taste the ocean in my mouth. The smell from the bowl is fishy and sweet because of the poke sauce. I also taste some garlic and lemon flavor from the sauce. The two flavors from the sauce kept me from feeling greasy for eating fish.  I was very happy and enjoyed the food from this restaurant.",

Both times I have gotten the large bowl with tuna. You can customize your bowl any way possible with the ingredients they have . I got spicy mayo both times and added a few items to make it like a classic poke bowl. They have a variety of sauces and toppings for your sushi /poke bowl.  Today I also ordered the baked green mussels which were great and 6 pieces only for 3.00 ! This is only the 3rd day and the people behind the glass working are a little tentative but that can be expected at a new place . You can also take sushi takeout from the case . Miso soup for a 1.00 also . The tuna both days was super fresh. I'll be back here again for sure.",

Very simple way of ordering, it's chipotle, you tell want you want in your bowl. On one side they have like a \"Grab & Go\" thing where there is a variety of sushi rolls and hand held snacks. It's very convenient for those who have short lunch breaks or just want a quick bite. Anyway on to the food. It's pretty affordable. Flavor wise it was delicious, the spicy mayo they use isn't to spicy but it has some zing to it. Very enjoyable. The cuts of fish they had were a decent size. From what I remember they had salmon, octopus, tuna, spicy tuna, mackerel and other fish. They also have their own miss soup dispenser. Lit AF. All in all a great place.",

We came to To See Roll because of the name cognition and convenience (my parents live 5 minutes down Rainbow Road).  First off- when we came to visit my folks for Thanksgiving- where on earth did all these Poke restaurants pop out of?!?! I counted nearly 5 restaurants on Rainbow Boulevard alone between their house and here.  Wow- must be some high demand and heavy competition!  Nonetheless, To See Roll was pretty memorable. We each got a poke bowl- my husband ordered a combination (he subbed out salad for rice base) and I got a custom build-your-own. The fish was delish- very fresh. The sauces were also yummy. I liked the pour-your-own miso soup station; we even got a few refills.   Overall, I can't wait to try other spots and see how they compare.  Thanks To See Roll- you've made me a True believer in Poke Bowls!",

My first two visits were poor because of the unwelcoming staff on shift who were also not very helpful and that experience in itself was enough for me decide I didn't really care to come back here. Because of convenience, as this place is so close to where I live, I ended up coming back a few more times, and it was refreshing to see familiar faces; our younger friends who have now gotten older & begun working here.   They don't have a lot of options to choose from here, but their fish is definitely fresh. Close to the register they have a juice dispenser and even a miso soup dispenser! I have never seen that before. They also have this neat refrigerated section with snacks, drinks and sushi rolls you can purchase.   The one thing I would really encourage the owner to change is their bowls. They look like (and probably are) the same bowls that Yogurtland uses. They are tall, wide cups but the rice as at the bottom and the food is seemingly stacked so what we end up having to ask the employees is to mix it all prior to placing it in the bowls.   Other than that, I'm definitely taking a liking to this place.  **update**   I've given some of the staff here the benefit of the doubt countless times upon dining here and consistently this one girl on shift just has terrible customer service. She doesn't smile, she doesn't talk or greet any of us, doesn't offer stamp cards, no eye contact, and generally comes off as if she's having a bad day.... Every single day.",

I'm going to have to be picky and say the \"bowls\" (they're more like cups) are cute, but not practical for poke and make mixing the contents a chore.   The variety of protein choices is amazing. They have the basics like salmon, tuna, and shrimp. What was great was that they had yellowtail and red snapper, plus unique options like cajun tuna and albacore. The scoops were generous, cut into a good size, and fresh.   The sauces choices are vast. I went with ginger and too see sauce, which was a safe choice since I knew what it would taste like together. I did ask for a popular combo of sauces and only got a list of what was popular. It would be nice to have a \"popular list\" of sauce combinations because there's so many choices! They also sauce the fish just enough - it does not overpower  nor am I wishing there was more flavor.   Onto the toppings! They had all the general toppings you would find at a poke establishment. The sprouts and edamame were a different and added a nice crunch to the bowl. The furikake on top of the rice was also a nice touch to give the rice flavor.  Overall, a really solid poke place. Did not try the rolls, but will definitely be back for poke. I just really dislike the physical bowls themselves. It's a nice design/look, but not very practical for eating.",

I was super content with the small and thought between the rice and fish it was the perfect amount.  Not to mention, this place is inexpensive.  $6.50 for a small bowl.

    "text": "This is the second time I've tried a Subway-style poke spot. The first time; at Sweet Poke, I disliked what I got for a number of reasons, including the overall taste of the final end product. This time, at To See Roll, I enjoyed the taste of my Korean Bowl a lot.   I still have trouble embracing this style of poke because it is overwhelming for a first timer to order, you don't really know what the end product will be or look like (or wether the taste of each component will complement each other), and it isn't \"premixed\" for you, as they would in a salad.   I know that this place isn't a salad place, but because the options for the bowl are either rice or salad, I'd actually prefer to have my salad mixed for me with the poke and other ingredients because otherwise I end up having to pick through my bowl this way and that while eating to try a little of everything, or worse--trying to mix my salad and poke myself--which ends up a mess of leaves and such falling everywhere. I am sure that if it were rice it'd be different, and I love rice, but poke bowls with rice usually give too much rice and not enough veggies for my taste, hence my salad dilemma.   Overall, my Korean bowl had a bunch of very ethnic ingredients which went well together (I loved that it was not tailored to American tastes of Asian cuisine, but actually Asiaon tastes of Asian cuisine). Some things I wasn't a fan of, like the rubbery strings of seaweed, but it did add extra texture and taste to the bowl. The bowl wasn't spicy of course, Asian level spicy is hardly ever actually spicy unless we're talking curry, but it satisfied the poke craving temporarily. Also, it came with tofu miso soup and I threw in some extra masago on the side just for fun. The to-go packaging was beautiful and neat.   Overall, a great spot to try out.",

This is how it played out I walked in first and my husband held the door for that rude customer if anyone knows the line is to the right as soon as you walk in but instead the rude customer decides she's not going to wait in line because she's more important than everyone and walks to the left and goes straight to the cashier where another employee was checking out another customer. At this time I'm standing in front of the counter waiting for the young asian girl to  acknowledge us but instead she looks at my husband and I and proceeds to help that rude customer so this point my husband speaks up and said to the customer and employee (asian girl) \"Umm we were here before her/you\" and the customer said \"I'm a regular customer and all I want is a roll!\" (Duh! Same here!) After that was said the employee (asian girl) clearly doesn't care and proceeds to placed her ordered on the iPad. So I told my husband let's leave because it's very obvious she has bad customer service.  Plus if I'm paying and tipping and this is how poor the customer service is I rather find another poke place, there is PLENTY!  Definitely NEVER going back or recommending!",

I have to say though, To See Roll is probably the only place I'll revisit again until that food truck visits town. Their location is very convenient to me in the heart of South Rainbow!   You can choose a bowl or burrito and customize it however you'd like or choose their signature bowls. I usually order a signature salmon bowl. Their ingredients seem pretty fresh. I have yet to try their burritos but I'm sure they're good as well! They recently added a new menu that allows you to make your bowl/burrito a combo that comes with a side, which I chose lobster popcorn roll. However, the combo menu is all the way to the left side at the end of the cashier so it's a little weird when you're standing on the opposite side trying to decide what to order.  Their service is great, too! Highly recommend.",

They are generous with portions and even more with the sides you get-- miso soup and, if you check in on Yelp, a small hand roll. Just be careful when you use the Miso soup machine bc I spilled a bit and it is hot. I had the To See bowl which I think is my new favorite.  The ambiance of the place is a little weird to me. They're trying to go for traditional Japanese but I feel like the large bamboo seating just takes up space and makes the place dark. That aside, this  food is good.  Customer service was vet good and the line (about 7 deep) went quick- 5 min wait for a Saturday lunch time. Get a stamp card also!",

Definitely portion wise is a lot compared to other Poke bowl spots. The fish tasted very fresh, and I love their white tuna especially do recommend getting that as part of your protein choice. I got the \"To See\" sauce which tasted like ponzu sauce with some ginger to it. Very clean area and well organized with their many staffs working.   In my opinion one of the best Poke spots in town. Will come back to this soon as possible when craving some more Poke bowl in my stomach.",

When you first walk in the line you have the option to choose from rice or salad. Personally, I like to get half brown rice/half salad. They have some bowl combos for poke you can already pick from or you build your own. The sizes are based off how much fish that you want the small is 3 scoops and the large is 5 scoops. The one thing I like about this place is the unlimited toppings, it makes the bowl really stand out because some poke places puts a limit on you and who really wants that?   One down side to this place is the bowl they use. It's really hard to mix so I always ask for a second bowl that I can use for mixing. Most of the time they'll be okay with giving me the bigger bowl, but sometimes they get kind of stingy about it. I've seen other people do this too so maybe it's time to rethink the packaging.",

    "text": "With all of the new Poke bowl places sprouting around the Valley, this one ranks among my faves simply for the fact that they carry sushi hand rolls a la carte like the kinds you find in Japan. For those unfamiliar, they come wrapped in a special wrapper that keeps the Nori seaweed separate from the rest of the roll until you're ready to eat it. Crispy nori on a hand roll makes all the difference and To See Roll has them amongst prepackaged bentos and the like.  Aside from that, the Poke bowls are delicious. They take the ingredients and mix them in stainless steel bowls separate from the bowl they're served in (which is very similar to a FroYo place disposable bowl). My only gripe is cream cheese isn't among the toppings. But not to fret, the typical sushi fare is all there.   You can create your own bowl or choose from one of their standard menu items.  Fairly large indoor seating area and the service was quick. Very reasonably priced for the portion you get and the fish quality is superb!",

I went to Sweet Poke to give it a shot and it was a total scam. Much smaller variety of fish and they charge $12 for 3 different meats and To See Roll charges that price for 5 meats! Regretted going to Sweet Poke the moment I saw the menu and plus the fish had an odd super fishy taste to it. Point is, To See Roll is awesome and I have to control myself not to go there every day.",

This wasn't so great. It taste a bit bland. The only thing I could taste was sesame oil and I wish they would have said the to see roll bowl was spicy.

They offered gluten free soy sauce also, but I didn't get it this time. Seating is nice with private booths, everything was clean too. I can't wait to try the sushi next time!

We never wait long for our food. I love the \"build your own bowl\" concept with your choice of rice or salad, fish, sauces, and unlimited toppings to choose from. This place also has a large selection of sushi rolls, appetizers, and signature bowls for those who don't want to build their own. My boyfriend and I always get a small bowl with brown rice + two scoops of fish + toppings. The portion size is perfect for us and everything is made fresh to order. We love how the staff are generous with the toppings too. Tonight, we ordered the 007 roll along with our poke bowls and we loved it! It was delicious and very flavorful. In addition, our order was reasonably priced. Our two small bowls and sushi roll came out to be about $23. I definitely recommend this place if you want delicious food and great service.",

    "text": "So looking for a place to grab lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  I had driven by and seen the sign earlier in the week, so I figured I would stop and try To See Roll.  Glad I did! The entrance walking in was a little confusing, but quickly figured it out.  The menu is simple and at the same time a little overwhelming.  You can order poke, sushi, sashimi, rolls and even more!  I opted for a large build your own poke bowl and a side order of shrimp and crab stick tempura.  Since I picked my own combination of ingredients for the poke bowl, I could come back dozens of times to make different combinations.  The important thing was the service was great, the food was fresh and tasty and the place is clean and comfortable.  I will be back for more!",

    "text": "This poke place is not Hawaiian authentic but it does hit the spot. The decor inside is super cute. And remember to check in on yelp for an extra scoop of protein.   Everything is really fresh and delicious. I like to make my own bowl and get whatever I like. You pick the size of the bowl, type of rice, fish, sauce and toppings. My favorite is the Masago, avocado, tamago and spouts. Most places will charge you extra for seaweed salad or avocado, but this place doesn't ( unless you want an extra scoop then they will). Price is really reasonable and the portion is pretty big. Don't under estimate the size of the small. If you pack it with toppings you will get very full.   They also have individually wrapped sushi on the side like but I haven't tried those. I think I will just stick to the poke bowl!",

    "text": "Poke spots are popping up like crazy and they can't all be good. I didnt quite like this place- the name doesn't make any sense and their use of yogurt bowls bothers me. But I was pleased with my first order (To See Bowl with black rice), the service was friendly, and the price was about average. Plus, they have a miso soup dispenser. If that doesn't get you excited, I don't want to be your friend.   As a couple of other people have mentioned, the set bowls aren't the best value because they come with three proteins- the DIY large is a dollar more and comes with five. I was less than thrilled to have a giant heap of salad at the bottom of my bowl, where it got soggy under the fish and sauce.  Apparently this is the way they do things,  as I had the same issue with my second bowl. This is also the first place I've seen that marinates the fish and sauce WITH the rice, which saturates it and makes it difficult to eat with chop sticks. Build your own and be specific to avoid these issues.   Bowls aside, they also cater to the grab-and-go crowd with a refrigerator of rolls, bowls, and individually-wrapped nigiri (another thing I don't understand, lots of plastic waste) made fresh daily. I don't remember what roll I got, it was a little plain, but decently fresh and not covered in sauce.  This isn't my first pick for a poke bowl, but it's also not my last. Whatever you get, be sure to add on a miso soup so you can use the little dispenser, which looks like a fountain drink station. Can I get one of those for my house?!  EDIT: Adding a star. The more I come here, the more I like it. I'm still not a huge fan of the cups, just because they pack them so full that I can't move the ingredients around to mix up my bites. But the fish and produce are always fresh, staff are really friendly, and they keep adding more to their menu.",

A medium size bowl ($8.75) gets you 3 scoops of protein which is a great portion for the price.  They have a lot of options for your bowl.  For the base you can get white rice, brown rice, black rice, salad, chips or half & half.  They also have protein options that I haven't seen before like red snapper, super white tuna and Cajun albacore.  A scoop of crab meat and cucumber salad is included too if you like.  Then there are all the veggie toppings for no extra charge, including avocado!      Besides build your own poke bowls, they have sushi rolls and Asian beverages in a refrigerated section to the left when you walk-in.  Who knew you could find great poke out in the desert!",

    "text": "Too See Roll is definitely my go-to place for my poke cravings. Three days after they opened, I was definitely hooked to the point where I would go there every week or even almost 7 days straight lol (amusingly enough one of my friends actually did that haha).   At the entrance you'll see two glowing air diffusers with aromas of ginger if you smell closely enough. I thought that was an interesting touch and liked the idea of having a diffuser or humidifier around so I actually tried to google and find the exact ones for my personal use lol! The ambiance was very 'asianesque' - with shiny wooden tables and benches. You can get various intricately packaged sushi/bento to-go on the left hand side of the restaurant as well as Japanese snacks such as pocky, soft drinks, jello, etc.   I would come here sometimes after my graveyard shift and would be greeted by the owner, Bruce, with friendly smiles to start the morning. I liked how he would actually be in the forefront on scene and interact with customers as well as so some labor such as rearranging the tables and chairs - it gave me the impression that he actually cares about customer service and giving a positive perception, which is a nice touch because its rare to see this at most restaurants in Vegas. Charlie the chef as well would greet us from behind the counter with friendly chatter so it was nice being welcomed by enthusiastic and sociable employees.   My typical order here would be: Large, mixed greens, crab salad + cucumber, yuzu+sesame sauce+green onion, cajun albacore+salmon+super white tuna+spicy tuna+yellowtail, masago,bean sprouts,extra avo, yellow radish, seaweed, furikake, and finishing touches of drizzled spicy mayo with said mayo on the side. The yuzu and sesame sauces complimented well as it was neither too sweet nor too salty. There was a time that they would run out of yuzu sauce I was recommended to try the house sauce+sesame combo as it was close to the same thing, and it was, just less sweet.   As a side note, their black rice is definitely filling as it was warm and moist but it did lack flavor at the bottom so I would think that adding rice seasoning would do it better (they do offer that option too) prior to choosing your proteins.   If I had the choice and time though, I would come here every day til I get sick of it. Its the closest thing to California's PokiNometry, so I'm rather overzealous about this haha!! :D",

Both were great. The salmon was nice and fatty.    All bowls of course include rice. For options I saw white, brown, black etc.    Something I really loved were the included toppings! I got imitation crab, cucumber,  masago,  cucumber, avocado, sprouts,  white and green onion.   You also choose from a wide variety of sauces.  We both went with the house one.

They have multiple fridges against the wall on one side where they have pre-packaged individual wrapped sushi and sushi rolls, drinks and water machine. The staff were very friendly and helpful.  They have 4 signature bowls that you can choose from, each comes with a small bowl of miso soup. They have small, medium and large. I got the medium Korean style bowl which was very delicious. The fish tasted very fresh, the sauce was delicious, the seaweed salad on top was very good too.  However, I will go for the build your own bowl next time. If you get the large you get 5 scoops of protein and a base, a free scoop of crab meat (the signature bowls do not come with the crab meat), you can choose your own sauce and ALL the toppings you want. The signature bowls come with very few toppings so the build your own is a much better deal. Build your own bowl do not come with a miso soup though.   Overall, very fresh fish, awesome flavors, and I will definitely come back!",

They have pre-set bowls which comes with a side of unlimited miso soup , or you can create your own. Not really a fan of miso soup so I usually just make my own poke bowl. Plus , you get more toppings when you create your own (the pre-set bowl toppings are kinda limited). I like that they don't charge extra for brown rice or avocado. They also sell fresh sushi and imported snacks/drinks. Only thing I'd suggest is lowering the window thing , it's a bit hard ordering/communicating back and forth , or maybe I'm just too short.

    "text": "Came here on a Sunday and if you eat raw fish a lot, you know Sunday's a bad day to come in since they don't get fresh shipments and it's a high chance the fish is left over from Friday. But I must say, the fish quality was really good and tastes fresh. I liked that you could add so many toppings to it and avocado was not an extra charge. They had a wide assortment of fish and other seafood to choose from for your bowl. I decided to get a custom medium bowl which comes with 3 scoops of protein. I chose yellowtail, red snapper, and salmon. They give you a wide variety of carbs or greens to choose from to. The line moves slow but that's because there's so much you can do to customize your bowls from beginning to end. Their mango smoothie was really good! They should call it icee or slush instead though because it's blended with only ice and doesn't have the creamy consistency of an actual smoothie. Only thing I would suggest them changing is their rice.. I expected more of a sushi rice that's stickier and not hot cuz once I ate the fish that was directly over the rice it was too warm..",

To See Roll being the third one on Rainbow just blocks away from Sweet Poke, and Jaburrito.  I used to have to drive all the way to my beloved Poke Express in Henderson just to get some good poke. Poke Express is still my all time favorite, but To See Roll definitely comes in second. They have a wide variety of fish options that I haven't seen at the other places and they are very generous with their portions! The price isn't so bad either for all the food you get! I got the large  \"build your own\" bowl for $10.75. A couple weeks ago I went to a different poke place and ordered a medium. The portions was so small that I was still hungry afterwards. I wasn't sure what To See Roll's portions was going to be like so I went large. This time I wished I went smaller! My bowl came with 5 proteins of my choice plus as much toppings as I want! Everything tasted pretty fresh! I also love that they carry black rice! Another cool thing about this place is that they have a fridge area on the side of the restaurant where you can select various kinds of individual nigiri, rolls and Japanese snacks! (Tip: you can get a free nigiri or roll with your Yelp check in) To See Roll will definitely be one of my go to places on the southwest side!",

I was hoping it would be similar to the one in Anaheim called Pokinomitry but it's not.... :(   Their bowls look exactly like the cups from yogurt land but just slapped with their logo on it. Looked weird to me.   I ordered a large bowl, which came with 5 scoops of fish. I got half salad and half white rice as my base. Rice was so plain didn't taste like the Japanese rice (sushi rice). There was no dressing for the salad. The sauce that gets mixed with your  fish I wasn't really impressed with the taste. I went with their suggestion, which was the Korean spicy sauce. They didn't have the spicy miso sauce even tho that probably would've tasted better. The fish portion I guess was ok....since I did have 5 diff fishes in my bowl.   I'll probably give this place another try since they just opened. They do have a stamp card which is pretty neat to me. I just think maybe they should change their bowls tho. They're yogurt bowls!!!",

    "text": "July has been an interesting month on the Southwest side of Las Vegas. 3 poke places (Too See Roll, Soho Bowlritto and Sweet Poke) have opened within 3 miles of each other to challenge Jaburritos's monopoly. Additionally, a forth poke place is being constructed near Jenny Pho on Rainbow just south of Robindale.   Luckily, each business differs enough to have it's own style, so they don't compete head to head. Rather, each has its own niche. Too See Roll setup is like Chipotle (without the e. coli). Enter from the front, a line wraps around the perimeter to the right where you order, slide to the left as your order is prepared then pickup and pay.   You  choose from three different size bowls; choose the type of rice (white, brown, black) and/or salad; pick up to five proteins (of which there are 10 fresh seafood choices) depending on bowl size; choose your sauces (11 available); and lastly your toppings (13 available).   As you move to the left, the cooks expertly create your bowl. Rice/salad base goes on the bottom; your proteins and sauces are incorporated in a mixing bowl then placed on top of your base; to be followed by your toppings.   I found all the ingredients to be extremely fresh and of the highest Sashimi grade. Nothing tastes previously frozen at all nor was there any hint of \"fishy\" odor or taste. Obviously, the selection is great, and allows you to have fun by trying new combinations.   Unlikely Jaburritos or Soho Bowlritto, they don't make burritos. However, they do have pre-made sushi daily. What I love about their rolls is that the seaweed wrap is separated from the moist filling and rice by a easily disposable plastic wrapper that prevents it from getting soggy and maintains its crispness.   Also, the decor is very lively with a Asian hipster atmosphere. Natural wood is incorporated throughout the eating area and non-florescent lighting is used to eliminate any commercial/industrial feel.   Another amenity is Free WiFi and USB charging ports at the tables. Unfortunately, IT ISN'T A POKE STOP. Come on Niantic, Poke Bars and Poke Stops go together. It should be mandatory.",

Like most others, it's a Subway/Chipotle style of assembling your food starting with a base (black rice is an option), protein, sauces, and toppings. I like the quality here. Plus, they mix up the ingredients for you instead of letting you do it. That typically means a better bite when I'm shoveling it into my face. I'm still not a fan of the small frozen yogurt-style cups, but I can look past that because the food is so good. They also offer sushi made to order, along with some grab-and-go options in their display case.",

They have three sizes to the poke bowl and with reasonable pricing. Variety of fish, toppings, and sauces to choose from. They also sell sushi rolls.  I wasn't a fan of their Philadelphia roll. Like a regular roll, it came with 8 pieces. This roll was $5 but prices vary on which roll you get.   Their poke bowl was good. I put salmon, creamy sauce, to see sauce, seaweed salad, and avocado. It was good, but a small will not fill you up. So I suggest getting a medium or a large. The bowls appear big, but it's not too large.",

To See Roll has amazing Poke bowls and it's awesome how you get to see your bowl being made right in front of you. And the best part besides the all of the options of salmon, shrimp etc? The PRICE. This place is pretty cheap. I got a medium bowl and my girlfriend got a small bowl and it all added up to a little over $20. At Bowlology, although they also have good food, I spend about $20 on just myself and with a lot less protein inside. Definitely recommend this place!!",

    "text": "To see roll is arguably the best poke place in Vegas, to some people...  As far as value goes they're pretty cheap and the poke is decent. I really like how they just put up some additional menu items like kale, edamame, tofu, and corn. But for the cons, they are always inconsistent.  Almost every time I go, they give almost random quantities of sides and protein. Take for example one experience; I went in and asked for a very little bit of imitation crab and little bit of masago, but when they finished making my bowl the entire surface looked like a carpet of masago.. aaand the imitation crab amounted to a huge scoop of ice cream.  I'm not sure if it's a communication thing, but it feels like I can't really make any adjustments to my order because they don't really hear it, or they just don't care?  Another thing that sort of bothers me is the sauce, they sort of drench the poke protein in it, which can come off as too much and even worse is when they pour it in the bowl. It's not appetizing having an inch of liquid at the bottom of my poke. Also when you add avocado it's so tiny, like literally not even a full slice piece..  A pro though is the interior is really clean. The only issue with the inside is that the front entrance always smells of this weird sulfur or egg scent that's kind of unappetizing.  But all that isn't enough for me to give it only 3 stars, the single reason was because of an experience I had with bad service. It wasn't busy at the time but I'm pretty sure the workers had a bad day when I went in, because as soon as I went in they were just really rude.  After each protein I asked for they even tossed the scoops back angrily at the container. Maybe they were mad at working so early or had a disagreement with another coworker? Either way though it was off putting, awkward, and it sort of made me not want to eat there.   I don't think I ever felt so awkward ordering food before, but as a rule of thumb an uninviting environment can do a lot even if the food and value is decent. It's part of the atmosphere after all..  I would give this place 4 stars but I just don't think I can when other establishments like pokenometry in California taste better, gives more avocado, smells more appetizing inside, and is more consistent.  To see is a good stop and had potential, but I just can't say it's a 4/5 star place just yet.",

    "text": "To See Roll has become one of my go to spots when I get off work late, and want to grab something a bit more wholesome than fast food (which is basically all the time).  They take the build-it-yourself formula of the pizza places that give you all the toppings you want for $9 or so,  it instead go with a pokebowl twist.  Choose a small, medium, or large, and go from there.  Your customization options range from the type of base (type of rice), side (crab meat, cucumber salad), proteins (fish), sauce (you can mix multiple), and toppings (10 or so different choices).  Based on my calculations, there are over 6,000,000 possible combinations of ingredients, but do keep in mind that I haven't taken a math course since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.  The ingredients have all been of good quality, and service is quick so you're not waiting around too long to get your food.  Another nice perk is that one side of the restaurant has open refrigerators with some premade rolls, Japanese desserts, and Japanese soft drinks.  It's nice that they have a mini market setup if you just want to grab something quick and be on your way.  The quality food and variety of combinations will keep me coming back.",

Growing up in Hawaii, I'm used to eating traditional Hawaiian-style poke - most of the time, it's usually no more than 4 ingredients - and it's already delicious because it's not masked by 20 different toppings. As such, I opted for the unagi bowl.  I'm happy I took this route. Everything about this bowl was great. The ingredients worked well together; salty from the unagi sauce (albeit a bit too much was drizzled) and sweet from the tamago (sweet egg). There's a nice variety of texture as well (masago, fresh sprouts, unagi). Topped with a bowl of miso soup, it was quite a satisfying meal.",

It's really great that they offer options but never an overwhelming amount of options to customize.  The taste and freshness has been consistent, and never ceases to hit the spot.   My favorite think about TooSeeRoll is that flavors compliment versus overwhelm, which is a plus in the sauce options...so you never make the wrong combinations, or regret your combo choices...we have all been there right?!? And they offer yellow radish!!!!  It's a great pallet cleanser.  There is a craze of poke bowl joints popping up randomly the last two months alongside the sushi burrito trend the past year.  I think it couldn't be of better timing which I love,  I no longer have to commit to ayce sushi as the poke bowl satisfies my cravings.",

You go through a line much like Qdoba and you pick the size of your bowl. Then you pick your base of salad, rice or chips and add all kinds of fresh looking fish from there. After you've picked that you can add little sauce garnishes, wasabi, seaweed salad etc. I think the food is fresh tasting and really delicious.

The atmosphere is cool in here, but a bit strange bc you're directed to either go left for sushi or right for poke immediately at the entrance. Feeling like I beat the system, I went right and got both poke and sushi in a generously portioned combo!  With a Yelp Check-In, you'll receive a discount on combos, which include a roll and a bowl of your choice.  Depending on the type of roll, and the bowl size you choose, the combo price ranges from about $12-16. IMO, this is a great deal as the rolls were very fresh and the bowls totally hit the spot.  You get a lot for what you pay for, especially with the amount and options of protein. There's a lot of choices, but I only went for the tunas and salmon - super yum!  I thought the service was fair and patient, but could have been a bit better.  In general, poke spots really need to provide something on the ordering process 101.  To any first timer, all these options can be really intimidating.  My advice: take your time - you might oversee something you want.  Though everything here seems like it would be pretty good.",

I couldn't eat anything solid.  Now some of you might be saying I should have called the health department. But I'm not trying to put this place out of business. Just want the business and guest aware. Like I said I frequent this place a lot that it hurt that I won't ever come back here again. To the owner and chef I know it's hard to see everything. But get your staff aware of shelf life. Cause it can REALLY hurt the business and people.",

    "text": "I love Poke. Like I would drive 40 min every week to get my weekly cravings. Since my family moved out here I was honestly so scared that I wouldn't be able to eat Poke, but of course Vegas has literally everything. I found this place on Yelp and trusted the reviews and checked it out myself. When I went in it was a bit confusing to see where the line was. They had two lines one for desserts and drinks and one for the food. I didn't know and when entering I went with my gut instinct and went left...but ended up going to the wrong line so I had to circle around till I got to the right place. So the important thing...the foooood!! The food was great! The fish seemed pretty good quality and the taste was pretty good! I got yellowtail, ahi tuna, and salmon with Spicy Mayo. The sauce was a little bland, but it wasn't horrible. I think I should have just asked for a bit more. To my surprise there were a bunch of different fish choices and I wanted to try new flavors like the really white tuna, but since it was my first time I thought I should taste what I usually get first to decide if I would go here again.There was a variety of toppings too and AVOCADO IS FREEE if you get the build your own bowl!! :D (Three sizes: Small is two proteins, Medium is three proteins, and Large is five proteins). Overall, the food was good and I think the portion was perfect. Some people might think its too small, but honestly it was perfect for me. YUMMMMM I would definitely go here again!! Highly recommend :)",

Get black rice as a base it's excellent, flavorful and healthy. What are you waiting for?",

The setup is like a Chipotle: choose a size (S,M,L), build your own or choose from their signature bowl (but I recommend building your own), choose a base (white/brown rice, mixed greens, chips, half&half), choose your protein (range of tunas, salmon, octopus, etc), pick sauce for your fish to be quickly marinated in (I always go with mixing Yuzu, Garlic Ponzu & Sesame Oil), then toppings (masago, seaweed salad, tofu, etc.) They offer nigiri pieces & rolls, as well as miso soup, udon noodles, & various Japanese candy & drinks. My little complaint about this place is that they don't add much sauce to the fish, so that's why I mix sauces to gain more flavor. & I would prefer the fish to be colder & fresher. They even have a stamp card: buy 10 bowls, get a free medium! I started going here in the beginning of October & I'm close to filling up my card already!",

They lost a star though due to two minor things.  1.  Due to a medicine I take that doesn't get along with green leafy vegetables I can't eat lettuce.  The folks behind the counter had a real hard time dealing with that.  I had to tell them twice NO LETTUCE.  And 2.  the manager in his zeal to provide good service actually got pushy and annoying.  I was sitting in the corner reading my book and enjoying my food when he came over to check on me.  That was nice.  Then he tried to drag me over to look at the various sushi rolls they sell.  I had to inform him that I was reading and enjoying my food and really didn't want to join him.  Maybe it's because he's new to the USA, but he's got to learn to read his customers.  Some want to simply be left alone after saying they're doing fine.  Others want to be shown stuff.",

Aside from the food being delicious -- the customer service is great, portions and pricing are extremely reasonable, and the venue itself is very clean with lots of seating.

We love the selection of different fish and add-ons you get for the bowl. Everyone was very helpful and always willing to explain what you get in each section. They do serve sushi rolls as well but haven't tried them yet. Love the atmosphere and layout. Always have fresh filtered water for free. The prices are reasonable for all the fresh fish and food you get.   So glad it's close to so much on that side of town.

    "text": "I heard this place is all over town and popular so we came to check it out. Well, we are very disappointed. Don't understand why it's popular at all. This is a Subway of a Japanese food. The fresh seafood are setup like Subway setup. You pick whatever you want in your bowl and viola ! That's your poke bowl. The mashed spicy tuna, spicy salmon and others are in trays and they scoop it up with an ice cream scoop. For a sushi / sashimi lover like me and knows what a good sushi and sashimi is, it is hard for me to like this place.   We didn't order the poke bowl as It did not look appetizing. I can never eat my Japanese food prepared that way and not by a sushi chef so we decided to get the rolls. We ordered the Hawaiian Roll, Something Wrong 215 Roll, spicy tuna roll and the soba noodle. Both rolls were disappointing. The fundamental test of sushi is the rice. The rice was breaking apart. The taste and texture isn't good or very poor for that matter. The size is horrendous you can't cram it up in your mouth to chew it. It's not one bite but few bites hence it falls apart. The fish isn't fresh. We didn't even finish it. We left it. We prefer the spicy tuna more than the big rolls. It's bite size and better than the big rolls. But even then taste and texture isn't good. The price we paid for all is $30++. Pricey for a fast food.   The place is clean. It's a fast food Japanese food. Overall we only finish the Soba Noodle and the spicy tuna as we were hungry other than that it's not worth it to go back.",

I love customizing my poke bowl, their sauces are great and the fish is very fresh. We have also ordered something wrong sushi roll and it was great! Sometimes they can be a little heavy handed with the sauce, but it has never made the experience or taste bad. I've ordered my bowls with tuna, salmon and yellowtail and have tried the white tuna as well. I recommend the too see roll sauce and the sesame sauce. I like to put a different sauce on my protein than my rice. If you're looking for avocado..it's there just halved on the side where they can cut it out from the rind. Don't forget to add tempura crunch at the end! It gives balances the textures nicely. Maybe it's good this place isn't by me because they would take all my money.",

    "text": "I really wanted to try this place because the restaurant's name sounded like my favorite chocolate candy!   I love the way this place is designed. The concept of this restaurant is very similar to chipotle. They have a variety of items on the menu. I ordered their specialty Salmon Bowl and it comes w/ the miso soup. At first, I was very confused why I got bowl with just tofu and seaweed. The technology in this restaurant is like those of China. They have a freaking self serve Miso Soup machine and water machine!! FYI there is no soda machine here. BUT the miso soup and water is all you can drink. It was so cool! I think I liked the machine the best.  The salmon bowl was very tasty. Next time I come back, I would probably ask for more sauce. It was a little dry for my taste. It came w/ lots of veggies and this place is not stingy w/ their fish. Thank you!!!  There are lots of parking available as it's located in a large plaza. If you plan on coming here often, they have a punch card. So be sure to get that so you get good discount after 10 meals!",

I had the To-See Roll bowl and the fresh ingredients and portion size is absolutely amazing. Not to mention the prices are very, very reasonable. My bowl was under $10 whereas the same item at every other place would've easily cost +$12.  Try eating the Korean black rice. I was surprised they even had that option because normally they only serve white or brown, but the black rice went so well with my to-see bowl.  What's cool is they have a miso soup dispenser so you can get seconds, thirds..drink that to your heart's content. You can get a combo here with a bowl, soup and drink easily under $10.",

You can pick between three different poke bowl sizes. Each bowl with a varying amount of proteins. I selected the large poke bowl that consisted of five proteins. (Definitely had a food baby aftwrwards)They had so much variety of fish here! Even cajun styled fish.  What surprised me there is that they are very generous with the portions and told me that I could select as much toppings as I wanted, uh wow? Yay!  They also have plenty of drinks and side items you can order too. When I mean variety, this place has it! Also, they have a stamp card for every order. 10 stamps and you get a free medium poke bowl. But you can't combine your cards if you have multiple, so don't lose yours! I will say though, this poke place is slightly more pricy than some other spots in town. But it was definitely yummy!",

The young female servers are very stingy when it comes to salad / chips portions (large or medium bowl). Plus when you ask for add on sides like unagi / eel - the tone of their voices make you feel like you should not have it coz it's expensive (happens to me 5 times in a row). Hello I can read and I can see your menu and prices... you don't have say the price and make it seem like it's too freaking expensive!!! Decided to go to the poke bowl restaurant couple blocks away from NOW on.  The owners need to TEACH GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE and serve consistent portions to those female young servers ...otherwise this business will NOT last!!!!",

This place sets up a fantastic buffet of fantastic meats, seafood and fresh vegetables. There were plenty of different sauces and all were able to be tasted before you pick the one or two or three you want.  If you are trying to eat healthy for the new year, this is a place you can eat until you are stuffed and there is no guilt. I ordered a small poke bowl and a sushi roll. Trust me I am an eater and the small bowl was plenty. The spider roll I ordered was perfectly made. Staff is very helpful and friendly. The bathrooms were very clean. Enjoy",

After not having raw fish for 9 months, I was really eager to try this place along with all the other poke spots in town.  I selected a medium bowl, which comes with 3 choices of protein. I got super white tuna, yellowtail, and shrimp. The fish is fresh, no doubt. My favorite thing here was that they offer black rice, which is super nutritious! It's not too hard and it has a good taste.  Service is average. The miso soup is self serve. There is a section for ready to eat rolls, desserts, and Japanese drinks.  With so many similar places popping up around town, I don't think I'll make a special trip to Rainbow for this place.   *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 57/100",

    "text": "I wanted to update my review since I've been here enough to fill out a stamp card, and I've also tried other poke bowl places since I first reviewed this place.   CUSTOMER SERVICE: 4/5 The staff is not as eagerly friendly as when I first started going, but they're still kind all the same. The glass barrier and loud music still makes it hard for them to hear you order. Sometimes, they'll mishear me and mistakenly use sauce I didn't ask for, and they seem a little annoyed they have to remake it. It wasn't the case when I first started going, and it also makes me feel a little bad.  They still have pretty good customer service here though. The last couple of bowls I've had here were a little lacking with the fish. So when I asked for an extra scoop of crab meat, and was informed it's the same price as an extra scoop of fish, I declined. The girl serving me was extremely nice though and gave me a heaping scoop of crab in the first place. Which brings me to my next point...  SERVINGS AND PRICING: 4/5 The prices are still reasonable for a poke bowl, but they aren't as generous as their competitors. They charge you extra for everything, and they seem really stingy now. Maybe their model wasn't very profitable before, but it's hard to come here and know it wasn't always like this. And also that there's 101 new poke places who won't charge you for a couple extra pieces of tamago.   ENVIRONMENT: 2/5 It looks nice and clean, but the last two times I've gone here, it has smelled really bad. So bad, that as soon as I went in the door, I have promptly walked out. A place that smells weird makes me nervous about eating the raw fish it serves. Maybe it was just a couple of off days?   FOOD: 4.5/5  I still stand by the fish and the sauce here. The fish tastes a little better than their competitors and I'm a fan of their house sauce. Their miso soup is pretty good, but if you get a refill, it tastes like water. I'm not sure if it was the machine that day, or if it actually isn't meant to be refillable and it just gives out hot water (whoops).   Some other things I didn't like? That they serve the poke bowls in a yogurt cup and the Too See Rolls are actually not very good, despite being called Too See Roll (weird right?)   OVERALL: 3.5/5  This place is pretty good if you're in the area. I don't really think there's any reason to be driving past other poke places to get here though. They're doing the same thing, and Too See Roll's one cutting edge (the Too See Roll) is not very good.",

For the following: - build your own poke bowls - protein picks include Cajun albacore woohooo! - added menu selections - preselected item poke bowls - offers udon soup - miso soup specials - sushi rolls - desserts - carries Hawaiian Sun - nice seating arrangement with the bar stools with a view and fancy lacquered benches - personable staff (we laughed about why the smoothie poster had pineapple but they actually don't have pineapple smoothie) - prep system for poke bowl orders (workers were good guides in asking what choices we wanted instead of referring us to their menu)  Maybe baby points: - Their large bowl isn't as large as other poke spots I've eaten. Then again it could be the different type of container they use, not plastic. - The menu is backwards.  Confusing for starters.  Begin at the bottom right and move eyes to the left.  Am I the only one who likes eating the danmuji by itself?  I love pickled radish!  Give me yours if we're grubbing together and you don't want yours.  Anywhoobees...

    "text": "So I wanted to wait until i actually dined in before writing a review.   First i wanted to start off with the pre-made food in their display cases. Both times that i have been there, the displays have not been full. I guess they are trying to keep things fresh? But they did look very empty.   The food in the display case... Was ok. Just ok. For the price, I'm wondering if they are actually worth it. The price is around $3 for a roll that is about 3 bites....$1/a bite...lol... And the three different rolls that i tried... Spam, Mexican and the inari.... Were all a little on the sweet side. But on the plus because if the way it is packaged... The Nori is super duper fresh. Quality 3/5... Price 2/5.  Now onto the nitty gritty. The actual bowl. I got their special unagi bowl... Medium size. The first person that took my order was friendly but he did not offer me the different types of rice. Just assumed that i would want the white which is kind of disappointing as i would have preferred the brown or the black rice. I only realized they had other types of rice as the person behind me got asked which rice they wanted. :(. The second person that took over my bowl was a complete dud. He just started to place items on the bowl and when i tried to tell him that i didn't want one of the items, he just kept on going. The original guy had to tell him that i was talking to him.   Seriously, how can you be right in front of the customer and be so totally out of it that when the customer is speaking, you just tune them out. How? Especially if I'm right there in front of you.  And after it was pointed out that i was talking to him, instead of offering to make me another one, he just kept on putting items on there... The first guy had to tell him, \"ask her if she wants to get it remade\". Then the dud actually looked up made eye contact and asked. I declined as i don't like wasting food, but even after all that he barely looked up, barely made eye contact and barely asked me if i wanted other toppings on my bowl. Service (2/5) very frustrating when the person that is finishing your bowl doesn't even acknowledge you.   Quality...2/5. First bite was ok. second bite got sweeter and third bite and so on got even sweeter. They drowned the dish in the eel sauce. Unagi was not as tender as others i have had before... And by the time i got to the bottom of the bowl, it was almost soupy with the sauce. Definitely not good eats.  Price...2.5/5 for the amount of food that i got for the money that i paid.... I'm not quite sure that it was worth it.   And they do not have a soda machine or even hot tea... They only have drinks in cans or bottles....:(  Honestly, the decor was very simplistic and tables were dirty at 11:30am on a Friday which is why i sat at the window. Ambiance (2/5) And the miso soup that you get from the dispenser was probably the best thing i had here. (5/5)...i actually really loved the soup. Delish!!  Overall, it is middle of the road...2.5/5... But since i can't really do halves... It got rounded up to a 3 star review.  Will i be back? Probably not. There are too many other poke bowl places around here for me to eat at.",

    "text": "Good location in a new strip mall near to Cafe Zupa's and Pizza Rev. Menu is quite hard to follow if it's your first time. Read it from bottom right to left! Choose a size, base, and which proteins you want, then all the toppings you desire.  The price is right. A small will run you $7, and includes any two scoops of proteins. I love that they charge you by the scoop, and not specifically by which kind of fish you want. Even avocado is an included topping item. They'll just charge if if you ask for extra. Seems more affordable than many other poke places in town.   So why only three stars? A lack in customer service is understandable, but their customer service is just dreadful. Don't expect to be greeted with a smile or much help from the employees whatsoever. Inspect a hint of annoyance instead. I have felt uncomfortable for the way I've seen customers treated and spoken to. I contacted management through an email concerning this incident, and did receive a very professional response from the owner ensuring me they would improve upon their flaws. I appreciate that he took the time to apologize and look into the employees customer service.",

They give you a good amount of poke unlike some other places that think you're on a hunger strike. This is also a fairly priced poke spot. Obviously you're gonna pay a bit more since its fish, but it's worth it. Idk the Asian chef there, but that's my boy! First week of opening my girlfriend and I went there and he let us try some mochi! Try the to see bowl! And say wussup to my boy because I don't know his name smh.",

    "text": "My review for this restaurant is unfortunately 3 stars at this time.  It seems like every time I visit my experience gets worse and worse and it really should be the opposite.    When i first visited and a few times after I really enjoyed this place.  Loved the portions they gave, loved how crab meat, avacado, and masago was not an extra charge for your first scoop and especially loved that they were the only poke bowl place that served radish sprouts.  Even better plus was that they had a stamp card.   I loved this place so much I filled that stamp card in two weeks!    After a couple months passed I realized they started being inconsistent with their portions.  I never had to ask for extra before because the amount they put in was enough.  They started putting less and so I had no choice to ask and pay for extra if I wanted more.    The last visit I had about a few days ago I ordered my usual.  Once again with the lesser portions.  However this time when I asked for my usual extra tamago on the side they gave me a smaller amount than what I usually get.  When asking for more they said they were going to charge me.  I pointed out that there was no extra charge for additional tamago.  They said it had to be in the bowl.  Mind you I do not like tamago in my poke bowl.  I am from Hawaii and no poke bowl comes with tamago there.  In addition if they were to put it in the bowl it would still fit.  I reluctantly told them to put it in the bowl then since that was \"the rules\" and asked for just a little on the side still.  They were going to charge me for that but thankfully the gentleman at the register said it was okay.  Not sure if he was the manager or owner or something.    All in all I won't be back as often considering a lot of other poke bowl establishments are opening up.  The pros used to drive me to travel from Henderson just for their bowls but now it's just not worth it.",

We chatted with both and felt super comfortable. LOVE friendly people!!   The concept of making your own bowl as you go is really awesome and I'm so glad Vegas finally has this type of restaurant. I don't always want to sit down and stuff my face with sushi so I'm really happy this spot is right around the corner.   The additional concept of picking one piece sushi and mixing and matching is also genius!   I would recommend this place in a heart beat and hope everyone loves it as much as I do!",

They don't overstuff their bowls with rice which I love and they have such a variety of toppings and sauces! Only thing I would have to say is their spicy sauces aren't that spicy :'( The sushi is extremely convenient and inexpensive as well, great if you have a quick sushi craving but don't want to spend the $10 on a roll. Ambiance is cute and very well decorated, and they sell a variety of Asian snacks which is such a cute idea. There are so many things to try and I'll definitely be back to try them!",

Regardless this place is cute and a co-worker highly recommended it to me.  I decided to try their signature \"salmon lover\" bowl as it was my first time here. Delicious, reasonably priced and large filling portions. Although the staff was friendly enough I am giving 4 stars because THEY DIDNT HONOR THE YELP CHECK-IN OFFER ON THE POKE BOWLS. The offer doesn't explicitly detail this, and staff told me it's 'something we used to do, but now it's only on hand rolls.'  Additionally they were doing some renovations while there were guests dining in the restaurant which I found off putting. I am excited to return to explore the menu further and will update my review accordingly.",

But this one has a real sushi chef in the back and a manager who really cares. He came up to talk to me because I was standing there staring. He gave me some suggestions, and told me what's best for wimps who don't like spice. I had no nervousness about food quality. All of it tasted great. Next time, I'll plan out my order ahead of time so I can make a custom giant bowl of yummy stuff!",

The base can consist of salad, rice, brown rice, black rice, chips and of course topped with furikake!  The options for toppings is better than any other place we have been to and they even throw in avocado and seaweed salad without and extra charge.  They have edamame, tofu, daikon, ginger, egg cake, radish, tempura flakes, seaweed salad, crab salad, cucumber, masago, green onions, and more.  The fish options always seems fresh and they have quite a few sauces as well.  The portion size is also very generous...pro tip, if you eat in, it seems like you get more than if you take it to go since the bowl is bigger. Get a frequent eater card, after 10 bowls, you get a free medium bowl.  Once the summer starts, we'll probably be here weekly!",

They have both poke and sushi options, and I decided to use their combo option and get both poke and a philly sushi roll. While the person serving me didn't exactly know gluten free options, he did try to help out. There are several sizes, and I opted for small, which was sufficient for me. There were plenty of options to add to the poke and they had gluten free soy sauce to use as a sauce. The fish and toppings were fresh and tasty.  I really enjoyed both the poke and the philly roll and will be back soon.",

Since my last review a few things have changed. The prices have gone up a tad, which is slightly disappointing. They have added 20 different sushi rolls to the menu. If you dine in, you get a real bowl to eat out of instead of the froyo cups. The refrigerated sushi section is gone. They still sell a few grab n go rolls but the good stuff is made by the chef.  The reason why I like this place is the food is always consistent. It tastes good every time. Granted I get the same thing most days because why mess with a good thing? My usual order is a large bowl with salmon, ahi tuna, corn, edamame, masago, and green onion mixed with garlic ponzu, spicy mayo and sesame oil. Then I get seaweed salad and pickled ginger on top. Amazing! I will keep coming back.",

    "text": "This is good. It's my second favorite in town so far (out of five or so tried). It's just not quite to where I'd give it 5 stars.  To See Roll is actually one of the older, more-established members of the poke bowl craze that's hit Las Vegas. It's in the fairly new plaza at Rainbow at Badura, which was surprisingly packed at the tail end of lunch hour today. I guess I have shouldn't be surprised, considering how many other restaurants (Cafe Zupas, PizzaRev, Farmer Boys) share this parking lot. Fortunately, I was able to find a spot after a little circling.  The restaurant floor is oddly split, and arrowed signs at the entrance direct you either to the left (if you just want sushi or grab-and-go food/drinks) or to the right if you want poke bowls (but not sushi burritos, which aren't on this menu). I went to the right and waited just a few minutes in a fast-moving line to place my order of a build your own bowl. The model is pretty standard, and it's numbered step-by-step as follows:  1,) Size. Signature bowls are preset designs at $9.50 for medium or $1.20 for large bowls, but I wanted to customize my own large bowl ($10.75 for 5 protein scoops). You can also go for a $7 small or a $8.75 medium, which all come in differently sized bowls and therefore fit less of the other stuff.  2.) Base. Sou at Brew Tea Bar recommended the \"purple\" rice (actually listed as Black RIce), so I went for it. Brown rice would be nice too. White rice is probably too plain and therefore not worth it if it's not sushi rice, and To See Roll is not calling theirs sushi rice. I might try the greens or chips in the future too.  3.) Side Base. Crab meat or cucumber salad. Actually, the employee asked if I wanted both, and I said yes.  4) Proteins. I noticed at this point that the above items were going into a paper cylindrical bowl and that they had a separate metal bowl, which I've seen used as a mixing bowl at one other similar place. This also proved to be the case here, and my choices of protein (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, red snapper, super white tuna - 5 for the large size bowl) went into the mixing bowl.  5) Sauce. I went with the To See Sauce after I asked the employee what it was. Can't remember his response fully, but I think I caught the words \"sweet\" and \"soy.\" He also asked if I wanted more sauces, and I said no but would probably consider adding a touch of sesame or ginger because they're usually solid flavors to have.  6) Toppings. I got green and red onions, corn, masago, seaweed salad, and avocado, which the employee hand-mixed with the proteins and sauce in that metal bowl. I also got furikake, sesame seeds, and radish sprouts, which all would've been nice to mix in as well, but oh-well-whatever. I didn't notice the ginger anywhere for some reason.  Everything was yummy. The black rice was nice and had some bite to it. The fish was fresh and cut into decent cubes, and I love super white tuna. I've yet to see anybody else offer super white. The even mixing of sauce and toppings helped to distribute the flavor pretty evenly, and I'll pretty much assume off-the-bat from now on that places which don't do this are going to be less-than-impressive.  I can't quite give the 5th star for a couple of reasons. First, the bowl is inherently flawed here because it is hard to reach the rice at the bottom of the bowl early on. This means that earlier bites will be more fish/toppings-heavy, and later bites will be a little more base-heavy. You'd need a more flaring top or something to get to the rice effectively. Oh, and the other reason? Some of the fish was way too chewy. I think it could've been the red snapper or possibly the yellowtail, but a few pieces had connective tissue, and you just can't have that.  To See Roll is definitely a nice poke bowl spot. It's one of the best in town, owing to solid ingredients and the mixing of sauce and toppings into the proteins. It's also significantly cheaper than my favorite location, which is also on Rainbow Blvd. And now I'm jealous again of people who live near Rainbow and not over halfway across town, so congrats to you if you're close to this restaurant.  P.S. Stamp cards available!  P.P.S. I forgot to note this the first time, but the window counters have those tall rotating stools with comfortable backs. 5-star chair rating..",

Sushi to the bowls, fish is always fresh and flavors on point. So I suggested this place to our office. Hopped on their website and found one menu, the poke bowl menu. No sushi roll menu. So we went on yelp and found a helper photo with the sushi menu, printed that out and decided on our orders.  Called once they opened and asked for delivery. Girl on the phone said we don't deliver, we said it clearly states on your website that you deliver. Her response was \"well sometimes my manager will deliver of it's a big order\". So we said, well yes it's a huge order, for 10 people. We want bowls AND sushi. She said \"well my manager isn't here so it isn't possible..\" Okay...forgiven. I was hungry at that point and really just wanted to order and be done with.   So we started to state our orders and she said, you must be ordering from an old menu. We don't have those rolls, we don't even serve albacore anymore.. 3rd strike. By this time it was almost 11 and having to find another lunch option for more than 10 people who all wanted sushi was out of the question. Didn't want to argue with her so we just ordered what she suggested and a couple of bowls that they were still serving.  Again just a clarification, 2 stars are for the website that needs updating. Upload all your menus, and take out that delivery option.",

There are two things that determine how a poke place is for me. 1. the quality of the fish 2. the portion size. The poke shops in Vegas have all been disappointing in one of those categories. To See Roll- A+ for both.  Tuna, yellowfish and salmon were my favorites for the meat. White rice and UNLIMITED TOPPINGS. The toppings on the board don't exactly match the ones on the counter so pay attention to both! Don't miss out on the tamago and edamame like I did by only looking at the board. Extra scoop of meat with Yelp check in! The avocado was small in portion and starting the brown. Don't waste the extra money for another helping.  Ask to sample the sauces. The To See sauce is a mix of soy and mustard.... which doesn't describe it well. It has a slightly tangy taste and really no mustard-y taste at all.  They also have miso soup and other Japanese drinks, snacks.  There's a really good boba place nearby... I think you can figure out where it is ;) Perfect combo!",

Great quality of fish, fresh & best tasting homemade recipes, friendly service, & a beautiful aesthetic inside the restaurant! Not to mention they sell my favorite Hawaiian iced tea beverage as well as other great snacks and appetizers!  I usually come here with my girlfriend so a meal for two might come a little pricy but other than that, I love this place!",

The Asian servers were extremely nice, but the blond guy behind the register didn't bother to say hi or even wait for our drink order. There are 2 lines inside, one for sushi and another one for bowl. I didn't think that was very clear, but maybe I was just too hungry to think clearly.   I got a bowl + sushi combination, and it was very good. Fish were fresh and tasted amazing. Rolls were equally good and well prepared.",

    "text": "So it's official. I'm hanging up my Henderson membership card and traded it in for a SW Vegas one. This is going to be my first review since moving to the SW part of town. I had no idea there were so many great places to eat on this side!  To See Roll is a Chipotle-style poke bowl restaurant and one of the newest to join the poke bowl scene here in Vegas. I visited with some friends to catch up before we started our third year of school and it was great food with even better company!  You start by either picking a pre-made/pre-planned bowl or you can go the route that I went and create your own. There are three sizes: small, medium and large. I chose the medium bowl and it comes with 3 scoops or portions of fish that you choose from.   Something that is unique about To See Roll is that they have the option of 'black rice' which the worker described as highly purified and healthier and low carb. I decided to try it along with scoops of ahi tuna, spicy tuna and salmon. There are a multitude of toppings and sauces that you mix in with your bowl after you choose your fish. Choose and mix to your hearts content!  The fish was fresh and of good quality as was all of the ingredients. I started a stamp card with them and seeing as I live right down the street, I will definitely be back soon. My only gripe and :( about this place was that the avocadoes in my bowl were hard/not ripe and they come in plastic packaged portions, not cut fresh. Boooo",

Upon entering, you will see a mini sushi market on your left and a line on the right to order your poke bowl. I ordered the To See Bowl which came with an assortment of fish (salmon, yellowtail, tuna), crabmeat, rice, served over fresh greens with a sesame oil/ginger dressing. As I was watching them make my bowl, I was already doubting the food. They mushed the rice (you can choose your choice of white, brown, or black) together with the rest of the ingredients and plopped the mush on top of the greens. It looked unesthetic, dry, and tasteless--exactly as it had tasted. I asked for some spicy mayo on the side as I picked out the pieces of fish to eat. As hungry as I was, one would assume that I would eat absolutely anything to tame my growling tummy. But nope, I couldn't finish the bowl and had to throw it away. Although the food didn't meet my expectations, the mini-mart on the left did. They sold my favorite meiji gummi choco candies for only $3.50!",

The counter staff needs to be better trained and more enthused for their work. Yes, it might be low paying and not all that glamorous, but at least appreciate the fact that you're working and someone (the customer) is paying to dine at your fine establishment.   2. This place really needs a soda fountain. Overpriced cans of soda doesn't do it for me.   Other than that, it's great!   *No pic necessary. There are so many already and most of these bowls look the same after awhile*",

The only drawback is that weaving your way through the long line can be a challenge at lunchtime but it is well worth the effort.  The fish is fresh, the employees are friendly and the prices are on point.  If you have difficulty deciding, take a peek at yelp tips.  That's how I found my way.

The way you order is similar to other raw fish bowl places around the area.   -------------------------------------  Signature Bowl w/ Miso Soup - $9.50  To See Bowl - Rice, Crab Meat, Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Masago, Green Onions Furikake, Rayu, Sesame Oil Unagi Bowl - Rice, Furikake, Crab Meat, Unagi, Tamago, Ginger, Green Onion, Masago, Unagi Sauce Salmon Lover - Rice, Crab Meat, Salmon, Salmon Egg, masago, Green Onion, Yum Yum Sauce, Spicy mayo Korean Style - Rice, Organic Mixed Greens, Cucumber Salad, Assorted Fish, Masago, Sweet and Spicy Sauce, Sesame Oil, Sesame Seed  ----OR--------  Build your own 1 - Pick your base (white/brown/black rice, chips, bread, tortillas, organic mixed greens, half & half) with a size choice of either Small $7.00, Medium $8.75, Large $10.75.  2 - What do you like? Crab meat, Cucumber Salad, White Onions, or Everything 3 - Pick your proteins - Small (2 Scoops), Medium (3 Scoops), Large (5 Scoops) - Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Super White Tuna, Red Snapper, Cajun Tuna, Octopus, Spicy Tuna, Shrimp 4 - Pick your sauce - Chef's Special (To See sauce, Sesame sauce, Ginger sauce, Yuzu sauce, Korean Spicy sauce, Creamy sauce, Yam Yam sauce) or Basic (Miso sauce, Spicy Miso sauce, Ponzu sauce, Garlic sauce, Sriracha sauce, Sesame oil)  5 - Pick your toppings - Masago, Green Onions, Red Onions, Ginger, Seaweed Salad, Wasabi, Jalapeno, Yellow Radish, Furikake, Kaiware (Daikon Radish) or at an additional $1.50 per scoop - Crab meat or Avocado 6 - Side Menu - Miso Soup ($1), Udon with radish ($5), Side Rice ($1), 6 pc Baked Green Mussel ($3), Soda ($2), Mochi (Strawberry, Mango, Green Tea - $2 ea)   ----------------------------------------------  A friend had came here the day before and recommended getting the large as you get quite the amount of food. So i had ordered a large with a white rice base, everything (crab meat, cucumber salad, and white onions), 2 scoops of yellow tail, 3 scoops of salmon with a To See Sauce. I had tested that the creamy sauce my friend recommended reminded me of a sesame peanut sauce youd eat thai skewers with xD) toppings wise, i essentially got everything except ginger and wasabi. To complete the meal, i also got a miso soup.  (piggy i know LOL)  If i remember correctly, the bowls they use for the large is 24oz bowls. The scoops for the fish they use are essentially ice cream scoopers and not melon ballers like other establishment uses. So it REALLY IS a lot of food for the money you pay. considering you are probably getting more fish for a few dollars less than surrounding places.   Overall, pretty good deal for a really filling meal. If you are one to not prefer too much sauce, make note to notify the person prepping your bowl.   Im not sure if it was a mistake or what but i think u can order the crab meat and avocado once, then if u want extra, then they will charge you.  Side note - they make their own individually wrapped nigiri too that is in a side fridge that you can make your own sushi box with. and prepped boxes. never tried it but some does look good.",

You can get all the sauces you enjoy like yum yum sauce, eel sauce, garlic ponzu and many more. I've been here twice now this week. The great thing is that it's a set price and the portions they give you are more than enough. I always get a large and you get to choose to up to 5 proteins ( fish types) white or brown or black rice. The sauces are unlimited and you can add all the toppings like seaweed salad ,avocado ,ginger and masago. You make it how you want it. They also have a couple refrigerators in the front where you can get pre made packaged nigiri and rolls and bento boxes. This place is awesome I will be back for sure.",

However, the service here leaves something to be desired.   I typically get the to see roll bowl on mixed greens and black rice with salmon, yellow tail, and white tuna and get the combo with either a caterpillar roll or the spicy dragon roll.   So here's the rub. Ordered the to see roll bowl and the guy kept asking me what goes in it... Well, i don't know because I don't work here, whatever sauces that typically go into your name sake bowl! So we got everything to go so the bowl( we ordered a large, he put it in a medium container and when we asked him about it he lied to us and said it was a large... When we looked at the bowl, M was circled... And we were charged for a large )   Then it took about 30 minutes to get our stuff... Just one bowl and two rolls. But only the bowl came in a to go container and the rolls came on dine in plates... So that was confusing.   All in all, it's a good spot to get a really good bowl if you don't mind waiting a bit and if you don't mind them messing up your orders a few times.",

The poke bowl tasted great, but was a buck or two more for the same amount (or less) you can get at other places. The spicy salmon roll was LITERALLY the smallest roll I've ever been served, and I eat A LOT of dead fish. Miso soup was....miso soup. Fav part of the food was their soy sauce comes in squeeze bottles! Love THAT.  Atmosphere: 5 Stars. Huge wooden tables, that can fit the most obese slobs. The music was decent and not too loud. The place isn't too sunny and bright, which I like.  Customer Service(lack of): 1 Star. Not sure if they are filming the sequel to \"Us\" here, but there's absolutely no personality from these people.. Didn't offer anything to drink, or even ask if I wanted to buy something to drink.. Also, I said \"thanks\" about 3 times loudER with each time, and not one \"you're welcome,\" \"GTFO,\" nod, wink, or any other acknowledgement.   All in all, not worth $19+.   *See my other reviews for better alternative poke joints in town, and one in Tuscon! Haha",

    "text": "To See Roll is the \"To Go Place\" for poke bowls! It's my favorite place to get a quick and fresh sushi fix without having to go to a sit down restaurant and eating sushi roll after sushi roll.   While they have their signature bowls, I love their build your own bowl option so I can customize it to exactly what I want in my bowl. What I also love about To See Roll over other places is their variety of bowl sizes, bases, toppings and sauces. Favorite things they have that other places don't have are the black rice and yellow radish.  With great food, friendly staff, quick service and a loyalty stamp card, I'm sure to fill up the 10 stamps to get a free one really fast",

You choose your base (the Korean Black Rice with furikake is a good option) then your meat, which you can choose raw like salmon or tuna to cooked like crab meat and shrimp. You also have the option of mixing it together or leaving it on the side. Then choose your sauce (spicy mayo is highly recommended) and the sides like corn and seaweed and you're set. The food is great, the fish tasted fresh and the cooked option were cooked fresh also. Service is also amazing, the service knows exactly what their menu consists of and are very helpful also. The price is also not bad for two large bowls and two guava juice ($30 something). Wish they had POG though but maybe I just missed it. Honestly, this would have to be my favorite poke places in town and have no reason not to come back again and again.",

After being a long time fan of another poke location also on Rainbow, but feeling that quality there was slipping, we decided to try out this location instead. I wish we had been going to To See Roll all along! The bowls are huge (especially if you dine in), the ingredients are very fresh, and there are tons of toppings included at no extra charge (even avocado!). A custom bowl runs about $12 for a large which includes 5 scoops (or about 10 oz) of fish of your choice. You also get to pick your base (a couple kinds of rice, greens, half and half, or chips), as well as many toppings and sauces. If you dine in, you also have access to unlimited miso soup which is a big plus!",

I walked in a bit confused if I should sit down and order restaurant style, or maneuver past the booths to place my order in an assembly line. The young girl was helpful as I explained it was my first visit. She walked me through what was popular and provided combination ideas. I stuck with the Build Your Own regular sized bowl and based it off their To See Bowl but swapped salmon for cajun albacore and mixed greens with black rice (half n' half). The outcome was delicious as the cubed fish tasted fresh, the endless toppings of cucumber slices, avocado, ginger, and crabmeat were a perfect compliment to the base of the meal. Overall, pleased with the experience - good service, diverse menu, and fresh ingredients.",

I ended up going with the Korean Style poke bowl. This had black rice, furikake, mixed greens, cucumber salad, assorted raw fish, spicy sauce with sesame oil, seaweed salad, chili oil, and it was topped with sesame seeds. My order also came with a miso soup!  I ordered my food to go and on the way out I saw a miso soup dispenser. I absolutely need one of these in my house!!   The Korean bowl was definitely one of the best poke bowls I've ever eaten. All of the flavors mixed together beautifully and the black rice was delicious. The miso soup had so much tofu and seaweed in it which made me happy. Too often I get miso soup and there's one seaweed leaf in it and a couple chunks of tofu.   I will definitely be back for more poke and endless bowls of miso :)",

It's an inconvenience to loyal customers going there for the affordable bowls. I don't go to other places because they are way over priced. I'm no longer going to be going there because I can possibly find another location that charges less or make it at home for a third of the cost.

Everything in the bowl was good, but the spicy tuna was too spicy for me personally and it tasted a bit off.",

    "text": "Perhaps I should have stuck to a signature bowl rather than opting to make my own here, but the poke bowl I got just wasn't very good. I ordered a medium ($8-something) which comes with three little scoops of fish. The fish itself was fine: salmon, ahi, hamachi. I got it with unagi sauce, which has been a good combination at every other poke place I've tried besides this one. Toppings are free, which is nice: red onion, cucumber, imitation crab, sprouts, furikake, masago, tempura flakes. The flavor of the bowl was lacking for whatever reason. Probably just a bad sauce choice?   Anyway, it was good to try this place but I'll be looking elsewhere for my poke fix.",

You can add cucumber salad or crab meat or both. Pick a sauce and toppings and they'll mix it all up for you. You get a nice hefty, healthy meal for under $10 now compared to where i work or any other sushi restaurants where 1 roll is over $10. The workers here are really nice and the ambiance is cool and casual. I enjoy coming here because it's a block away from where I live",

Something wrong at 215, lasagna roll, and crunchy shrimp tempura rolls are all delicious and I look forward to saying that to the entire sushi menu. The sushi chef is very kind and doesn't seem to mind a little of customization to your rolls. ;) The seating area has cool tables with benches and inside awnings. Try the miso soup for a dollar!",

I'm going to be honest; considering the fact that I grew up in Hawaii where traditional poke is NO WHERE NEAR what these bowls claim to be,  i was originally turned off by hype of modern \"sushi bowls\" being labeled as \"Poke\". However, it doesn't knock off any stars because this place is delicious!  Pricing is impeccable.  You cannot find a place anywhere in town that compares to the sizes of their bowls for the price they sell them at.. let alone the options that it includes.  Depending on the size of the bowl, you get a choice of either 2, 3 or 5 proteins, as many toppings and sauce as you'd like, most of them being at no additional charge... and a great wall selection of assorted roll's and imported snacks/drinks.  My fave? I always get a large size with 5 proteins and I switch between the options of salmon, spicy tuna, shrimp, regular tuna, albacore. I love their black rice (apparently there are major health benefits to this type of rice), I go crazy on toppings and i love their creamy and garlic ponzu sauce mixed.  Oh and I always add the crab and cucumber as well. YOU CANNOT GO WRONG.  I'm a regular and I think I've turned in 3 full stamp cards so far. for every 10 you get 1 medium bowl for free!",

Bits of cucumber yellowtail and crab. So I scrolled down to see if anyone had the same experience. Yeah.. the thing with young kids working....they don't fully take responsibility for health code regulations. The stainless steel bowls are good upside down but they need to be completely dried then stacked. Also the sauces are good but makes me wonder when have the bottles been completely washed,sanitized and dried before filling up with fresh sauces. Labeled and dated.. FIFO toseeroll.. understand it and use it! Going to repost this and hopefully no one else gets food poisoning... I'm a local Chef at a major casino and definitely won't come back... highly upset.

I will say, though, it's not like there is a poke bar on every corner - it would be nice if they asked if you've been there before or been to any before so that we could have gotten guidance on what to order. There are no sauces or spices on the table, and I found the bowl to be a little bland, so that would have been nice. I went back 2 days later and the person working was much more helpful. I received miso soup with the order and was told it comes with it. That would have been nice to know when we went the first time. I would recommend to try it, it's tasty.

My boy friend and I have gone through 6-7 cards, meaning we've been literally like 60-70 times within the year. It's seriously one of our favorite places, if not our favorite! I've tried other poke bowl places in vegas- this one takes the cake! They have a good variety of different bases, fishes, and toppings to chose from. They also have a shit ton of sauces and they will mix as many as you want. Other places usually only give you 3 scoops of fish for a large- not including crab meat. Too see roll gives you 5 scoops of fish, and comes with the crab meat if you want it for no additional charge! They also have good combo deals, getting a poke and a sushi roll of your choice for a reasonable amount. The staff is friendly, always attentive, and willing to satisfy. Honestly, for the quality and the price- you can't beat it. I have NEVER once been disappointed in the quality of flavor of my order. This review is over due but, five stars hands down.",

I would definitely come back. Highly recommend    Location is a new building so everything is brand new & clean (so far). There's air freshener at the entrance which I didn't mind but I could see how it can bother some ppl who are sensitive to the smell. Love the seating/benches.

All the fish seems super fresh, and the serving size portion is great for the price.  Great poke bowls and I drive 30 minutes just to come eat here. The staff is super friendly as well. I will never go anywhere else to get my poke bowls.    I typically order a medium or large bowl.  Depending on how hungry you are I would suggest the medium.  I do not like eating leftover sushi.  The medium bowl comes with three different types of fish.  I normally get the spicy albacore, spicy tuna, and white fish.  When you check in with yelp, you get a free protein.  So not only are you getting a rice bowl, but then you get 4 different types of fish for the price of 3.    The staff does a great job with hand mixing the bowls, and they are pretty amazing.  I can't say anything negative about this place besides the fact that it is a small location, and maybe they should think about expanding locations and having more in different parts of the city.  It is extremely good, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves sushi.  The customer service is great.  The food is great.  And the pricing is great.  I LOVE THIS PLACE!!",

My lunch which was one roll, cucumber side salad and a drink was $12.00.   My friends got the poke bowls and said they were ok. I was a little concerned because my roll was all sashimi but it wasn't even cold on my tongue. I don't know about you, but cold raw fish should be COLD.

My boyfriend and I had gone there to get some food to go before we go over to our friends house. Tell me why it took 30 minutes just to order to go?!?!!! And it wasn't even busy. There were like two cars who pulled up next to me (I stayed in the car while he was supposedly to go in real quick to get the food) and they had left before us. I got irritated and called my boyfriend to see what was going on. He said he had ordered two bowls to go. Then he asked if he could use the Yelp check in. There is 15% off a combination order so you have to get a roll too. He then asked if he can use the 15% for two combination orders because then he wanted to get two rolls instead of one. They told him yes so he ordered two. Then they had to make sure the sushi chef was still there? When he was, it took him SO LONG to make two rolls. Did I mention how we waited for 30 minutes?! My boyfriend said the reason why it took so long was because the manager was chit chatting with the sushi chef. THEN when he's finally about to pay, the manager says he can't use the 15% off for the two combos because it's only one check in or whatever. So my poor boyfriend had to wait THAT long for something they said they would do- he wouldn't even have ordered the rolls if it was just for one roll because he felt bad they were only making one. My boyfriend said it was a horrible experience and doesn't wanna come here again. There are so many other poke places popping up that are also good as well! With much better customer service.",

    "text": "I think this is one of the better poke bowl places in vegas and i've been to quite a lot if them. They have sushi made to order but i always go for the make-your-own poke bowl. If you dont trust your own tastebuds to make a bowl yourself, they have a menu of poke bowls to choose from (+ you get a free tasty miso soup with these type of bowls). I like how there are many options to choose from: for example, when choosing a base you can do black, brown or white rice or chips or salad. I've always done the  black rice with furikake on top. There are also tons of proteins to choose from and depending on what size bowl you get, you can get lots of protein. (3 scoops of protein for a medium, 5 for a large-i usually switch between these based on how hungry i am). Not only that but their protein is pretty fresh tasting. What i like most about this place is that you can add all of the mix ins or toppings and won't get charged extra for things like seaweed salad, masago, or avocado like they do at other poke palces. I knocked one star for price just because it gets pretty pricey. It's not a place i can eat at everyday. But the good thing is that they have stamp cards..buy 10 get one free. Try it, you'll like it!",

Another thing I did not like was... They put my order in a bowl and with a gloved hand, she mashed/mixed it. Can they used a spoon to mix it instead of using their gloved hand? I know it is clean (hopefully) but still... It's kinda disgusting watching them smoosh, mashed, mixed, \"lamutak\"(in tagalog) your food!

The narrow snack and medium \"yogurt\" bowls make it kinda hard to eat out of.

Crabmix and Salmon as the 2nd and 3rd proteins created a perfect sweet/salty balance, and being able to fill the rest of the bowl with roe, seaweed salad, edamame, ginger, and more makes it so much fun to eat. Excited to try To See Roll a few more times, in a few more protein combinations!  Los Angeles poke/sushi bowl spots really have it dialed. But To See Roll is on the brink of awesomeness, and is poised to become the gold standard in Las Vegas. Definitely try it if you've never had it.

Scent is a bit excessive and not good for people who are sensitive to smell like myself. Tables are glossy and shiny as mofo. Holy cow, it is so shiny you could probably use their table to do your makeup.   We got their salmon lover bowl. Same procedure as other poke spots where they scoop proteins in a bowl and marinate with sauce before laying it on rice. Except the worker making our bowl squeezed out about half the bottle of sauce on salmon. Needless to say, those salmon slices were swimming in sauce. Or drowned in it. Other yelpers had mentioned that bowls here are bland so I'm not sure if they are working out some kinks and adding more sauce but it was way too much.   I also have to mention that their bowl comes in paper cup used for frozen yogurt. The spoon they give you is also for frozen yogurt. I hate it.   Bowl came with miso soup on the side. Instant miso soup. Bland.   Overpriced for what they offer. I won't be back here.",

    "text": "Went to To See Roll the other day for lunch as I was craving sushi. I just needed a little bit of it and not the whole sushi buffet experience.  As you walk into the restaurant, there are two lines, to the right is the line for poke bowl and the left you can order sushi. To my delight, they had pre-made single serving of hand rolled sushi you could select from. Unfortunately, because I got there towards the ending of lunch, a lot of the trays were empty. Once I figured out what I wanted from what was left, I went back to the front of the restaurant to grab a tray. I picked up a Rainbow, Philly and two Crunch rolls. The pre-made rolls are priced between $2.35 and $2.95. I also purchased a small bowl of miso soup for a $1.   Before I forget, next to the pre-made sushis are a few dessert items and japanese drinks you can also select from.  I've made sushi and musubis before, but this was my first time having to \"roll\" my own pre-made sushi. Each roll is wrapped in plastic. However, when you unwrap the plastic, the rice and contents is separate and the nori is in it's own plastic wrap. But I get it. If not, a lot of times the nori gets soggy. So I found it interesting for me to have to unwrap everything from it's plastic wrapper to re-roll my sushi rice with the nori.   You also have a choice of having a freshly made rolls that start at $7 to $13 depending on what you get.  In any case, its a nice clean restaurant. I'm definitely coming back because of the convenience of quickly grabbing a few sushi rolls for a quick and lunch.",

    "text": "I'm determined to try every Poke Bowl spot within 5 miles of my house and this place is just about the same as the others. My favorite is still Poke Poku because their sauces are great and there are soooo many options for toppings.   The downsides for me started with the separating lines that go on opposite sides of the restaurant (one for sushi/bottled drinks and one for bowls). What if I want both? I came for a bowl but it would have been nice to see the sushi roll options prior to paying. Next is the oddly sized glass case that covers the fish and toppings. It's just about forehead level for me at 5'5 so it was awkward ordering to someone I could barely see. After paying I got to walk past the wall with all the sushi and the drinks that are only seen as leaving. If I return I know where to look but newbies, keep your eyes open! Lastly the folks I ordered with were unenthusiastic and didn't offer much explanation. I told them it was my first time there and the most interaction I got was when I was offered to sample sauces after I froze with indecisiveness lol Luckily there was no line, perhaps, since it was almost closing.  Anywho, I ordered the large and it was 5 small scoops of fish plus crab meat and cucumber salad. It was a nice variety and everything was fresh. Food gets a solid 4 stars, I just need to find the right sauce combination to set it off.",

I was hesitant  because I was afraid it wasn't going to be fresh so I got the small bowl just in case. I ordered the white rice, octopus, tuna, shrimp, seaweed salad with cucumber. I like the tuna much better than the octopus because the tuna was fresh it didn't smell either. The octopus had a smoky taste to me. I liked the consistency of the seaweed salad it reminded me of the salad I had at the Aria buffet years ago. I tried it with the sweet sauce which they let me sample . If I didn't have to rush back to work I would have liked to try the white sauce also. The service was fast , friendly and all four of us got our food quick enough to eat it all during our lunch break which doesn't always happen.",

    "text": "Where did all these poke spots suddenly come from? Man, either I'm super picky or this place is just not good! I'm a big fan of Poke Express and sorry this place just does not compare.   Pro- sushi to go looks decent. I have not tried it though.  Cons- portion size for price, inconsistency, blandness, stingy on ginger, and \"hands on\" mixed approach  Let me explain. My friend got the same thing as me but her fish scooper gave generous heaping scoops of fish. My scooper gave precise to the line scoops which in the case of the tuna ended up being 5 tiny pieces. I think it should be consistent.   So I got the To see roll special. They place the fish (several kinds),the toppings, the rice, and the sauce in a silver mixing bowl and proceeded to MIX IT all up together like a big MUSH. It looked like dog food at that point. I don't see the point of this? Why not place the rice in the bowl then possibly mix the fish with sauce then place the toppings on top? Now I didn't want to eat all the rice but I had no choice since all the toppings and fish was mixed in with my mixture. It reminded me of when I was a kid and we took mustard, egg, relish, ketchup, oatmeal and a bunch of stuff and mixed it all up and then dared each other to eat it.   So she takes the mixture and places it by hand back on to the lettuce in the bowl. Maybe that's how some people like to eat poke all mixed up but not me. I was just so turned off by this woman mixing it smashing the ingredients together with her hands. It would be great if they explained this to customers or notes it somehow that this is how they do it since it's not how most poke places do it.   It was our first time and we let that be known and no suggestions were given by the employees.  On to the taste- it was bland. I asked for some ginger and the employee I asked gave me 2 slices in a plastic cup. It only filled 1/3 of the cup. When I asked for a little more she filled it up with one more piece. I didn't think asking for a full tiny plastic cup of ginger was that big of a deal.   I decided to save my comments to myself and asked my friend how she liked it. She began to pour soy sauce on top and told me it was bland and tasteless. I did the same. I would never do this anywhere else I've had poke.",

    "text": "Not joking about Poke crazy going on in Vegas. NO not the dam Pokeman game yelpers. LOL.  I decided wanted try one of the latest ones To See Roll for some Poke bowl action. I must admit out of all the new ones popping out around town. To See Roll definitely has some personality comes to the decor and gives you more options then just Poke Bowls. They have section that has bunch of different desserts mostly individual wrapped and most from Japan assume or based on the labels stuff see at asian markets. The rest of that cold ready to go section has individual freshly made sushi daily. Most of them are nigiri ones. They also have smoothie machines. Fountain drinks none they only sell by the bottles.   The way it works choose from three different size bowls. I went with the Large bowl. Each bowl it based on scoops for your protein. They have list choose from I went with cajun albacore and salmon. The large you get five scoops. It was first time but thankfully they were super friendly, helpful in explaining things, and told me not all five scoops has be the same thing. You literally could get five different things. Just FYI not really good idea...The scoop they use for the portion is pretty tiny. I went 3 scoops tuna and 2 salmon. The base you can choose from white, brown, or black rice (I think need to try that next time). Also can choose organic mixed greens for base. The sauce I just went with the workers recommendation of sesame seed or the one that most popular. It was really good. Not overpowering with the sesame seed with pinch of heat. The toppings works like most other places decent selection and then some that you would have pay extra. I stuck with simple. I notice they had green seaweed salad. I love that stuff and can not remember any other poke bowl place offers that as topping. The portion for large is good size, reasonable price, and it was filling to me.   The sushi not sure if it was the sushi chef. Someone was handed out pieces if anyone wanted to try. I like sure got the tamago. It nothing special. Ok. I did enjoy having that option if wanted little sushi with your poke bowl. Just odd seeing all individual wrapped.   The decor was awesome. Or maybe all the poke bowl spots been not this feeling of restaurant restaurant. At To See Roll few places that you can sit down. One of the first things that stand  out is they have humidifier all scented walk in. Inside is nice each table area feel own area not just table in open space.   The workers are all awesome. Friendly. Super helpful being my first time. Not doubt To See Roll will be one of my spots in my rotation of Poke Bowl rounds near the house!!!!",

There's a variety of sauces and toppings that you can choose from, so you don't have to have the same thing every time (unless that's your thing). There's a lot of protein options. The bowls may look small, but he portions are satisfying. It tasted so good.   SERVICE: 3/5 The service is pretty good. The people kind of helped me through the process. It gets a little confusing because there's a lot going on and the steps go from right to left on the board. I didn't have a strong impression, though, and the people didn't necessarily enhance my experience. I was a first-timer, so I was a little confused. At times I felt kind of rushed in the line.   LOCATION: 3/5 I think it's in a good location. It's easy to find from the street as you're driving, so that's convenient. However, I don't know if it's close to a lot of places though, so it's not easy to stop along the way to places.",

You have signature dishes you can choose from, but the lovely lady suggested we make our own since we can pick and choose what we want.  They offer 3 different sizes - small, medium, or large. You're give the option between white or black rice along with rice reasoning. They have a wide selection of meat. I chose yellowtail, tuna, and salmon. They have a wide variety of sauces - I was recommended the garlic ponzu. I'm a garlic lover, so it was an excellent choice. I also had the meat mixed with yum yum sauce. Lastly, you have your toppings to choose from.   They have a miso soup machine, which I found quite interesting. I mean... Let's be honest. How many of you have seen a miso soup machine?  Some perks that they have is quick sushi pick-up to go. They have freshly made, already packed sushi rolls that you can just buy. They also have a good amount of Japanese snacks near the registrar!

    "text": "Went here because me and my hubby love poke (just like errbody else) around 1pm on a Saturday. Place wasn't crowded but I guess cause it's new. Fresh humidifiers filled the room with a clean fresh smell which wasn't fishy at all. The whole decor is very Japanese like in the streets and markets in japan: open refrigerators full of fresh made nigiri (which no one was getting) and a smaller case filled with Japanese cakes, Pocky sticks and other sweets.  The menu was a little confusing as they have pre made bowls as well as make your own. Pre made is set price at 9.50$ while the make you own large is around 10.50$ (see menu in pictures)  Because we were hungry I wanted to get the most for my money. What is not made clear is that the set bowls only have 2-3 scoops of pre-chosen, non specified proteins and the portion size is about the same as a medium bowl.  TIP TIP TIP: Def not worth getting a pre made bowl when most of the toppings are u limited and u get less protein in each bowl. For 1$ more u can get a large bowl with 5 scoops of protein.  Here how's u choose: 1) choose base- white rice or brown, mixed greens or cucumber salad  2) choose your protein: tuna, Spicy tuna, taco, salmon, tofu, etc 3) choose toppings: masago, eggs, green and red onion, furikake, ginger Sauces: spicy mayo, ponzu, etc/more Being from Hawaii where the poke bowl is from, I've eat tons of poke and poke bowls. What I found super weird is the amt of greens that were being put into my poke bowl. We had to actually ask the girl to remove a whole ton of lettuce from our bowl because it is non tradition to have lettuce As a base- but I guess they do this to please the gluten free/non carb loading people. Anyways another thing that was annoying was that I'm 5 feet. The glass cover container covering the food along with the medium loud music, I couldn't for the life of me hear over the glass container that what the girl was asking me I wanted with my bowl. It was really frustrating.  As for the quality of the fish it was really good and tasty. Can't really speak on the freshness because most poke places have previously frozen fish.  I'm not sure if I'll be back because the portion sizes were too small for the price of 11$ for a large bowl. Don't come super hungry cause the portions of protein is tiny- even with 5 scoops of fish in the large bowl.",

Id had soho sushi burritos and jaburritos and I don't know why but they just don't compare to ToSeeRoll.   First of all, I come here way too often. I love grabbing a large bowl and taking it to campus as my lunch. I've sat in to eat once; its really nice inside but if you are sensitive to scents I'd just grab it your food to go (ginger-esque humidifiers are really strong).   The food itself is really great. TRY the Black Rice. All their ingredients look and taste really fresh and they offer so many choices of fish. I think they could have a few more veggie toppings but that hasn't stopped me from coming. They also have a variety of sauces so make sure to try different ones to find your favorite. (You can get more than one sauce in your bowl).",

What makes this place stand out is the endless options as well as FREE avocado (yes, I said FREE). Also, I love that you can get a combo that comes with a bowl and a sushi roll. Its poke overload for around $13-15.  Join the text club and receive promo texts and money off.   They used to have individual rolls and nigiri in the fridge cases when they first opened, they since have got rid of this. Now they do fresh rolls on the spot. I do miss my individual pieces of salmon and yellow tail for around $1.50 each, but now they come in a order that is around $4-5 dollars :-(",

It's DEFINITELY not a substitute for sushi (which was my mistake).   I ordered the 3 item medium bowl, and used the TOO SEE sauce for my bowl. The cucumber was vinegary and refreshing, and the imitation crab meat (yeah I like fake crab, judge me all you want) was good.   I loved that they sold individual nigiri sushi's on the side area where you can pick and choose. Their inari is pretty good. It's a bit small, but not a bad option if you are in the mood.   I definitely want to come back and try the Korean spicy sauce next time, in hopes of having it be a substitute for HWE DUP PAB (korean style sashimi and salad bowl with rice...kinda like bibimpab but made of raw fish).",

They now serve rolls. Not sure if they are made in advance or on the spot. Not really my thing, I stick to the bowls. Definitely make sure to try all the sauces when you are there.

I was super excited for this place to open because it was one of the first on rainbow.   To see roll is like the other poke places, chipotle style. You can opt to make your own bowl or have a signature bowl. My first two visits I ordered signature bowls & I did not like them. I think it was because of the sauce? But I'm not sure. If you do order a signature bowl though, you get a free miso soup! I didn't think I would come back to to see roll since I wasn't a big fan the first couple of times, but my friend loves this place so I had to come back with him. On my last visit, I decided just to make my own bowl & I liked that a lot better. I ordered a small bowl & that comes with two scoops of protein. I got pretty full off of my order!   To see roll isn't my favorite but I'll probs be back. I can't really comment on service since they don't wait on you or anything?",

I've been here a couple times now, but today was my best experience. Maybe it was the sauces or my toppings I picked out today. Shit, maybe I was just extra hungry.   I am more about traditional, simple Hawaiian style Poke. Just Poke and rice, maybe some furikake. Today, my overpopulated Bowl was actually really good. Fish was fresher (ahi, salmon, and spicy tuna) than I remember it being the first couple times I've been here. I like how they now serve sushi rolls as well; I may come in to try them in the future.",

    "text": "I love love love poke! It goes as far back as sneaking a bite from my dad's bowl back in Honolulu Hawaii and ever since that first bite, I fell in love. Even after getting my hand spanked by my dad for stealing his food and consuming raw tuna while I was a kid! lol However this place reminded me of Hawaii again.  *****Environment: The place is spacious, well decorated and gives that Japanese feel. With wooden dividers and big benches you can see and socialize with friends. They also had a humidifier at the front to help keep the place well humidified. The drinks were nicely placed on shelfs and the food was nicely presented.  *****Food: The food, ah yes the Poke was amazing! I would've built my own custom bowl however I decided to try one of their featured bowls, the Korean Poke Bowl. The reason why I choose this was because it was labeled to be the spiciest and you know me, I love spicy! The Korean Bowl was just delicious, there was a good amount of fish vs rice ratio and the flavor was just there unlike other places that are greedy with their sauce. This place really gives you the full sauce flavor! Definitely recommend. I also wasn't sure I would finish a large bowl, however after realizing how good it was, I devoured it like a baby who hasn't eaten in weeks!  *****Service: The service was friendly and patient with me, I explained that I was out of town and new to the place and they took the time to educate me and how the process works and what their recommendation is. Great work guys!  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place and I approve for being a great Poke getaway!  [ Taste it, Love it, Yelp it! ]",

    "text": "DIY poke bowl spots are a dime a dozen in the Las Vegas right now. To See Roll is my current favorite. It is rare if a week goes by and I have not had my TSR poke bowl fix for lunch.  The biggest issue I have had with other poke bowl spots is they just throw everything into a bowl and add sauce on top. To See Roll is the only place I have been to that sauces the protein separate from the other ingredients, which means your poke taste more like actual poke and your other ingredients do not get soggy as quickly.    These are the other reasons why I think To See Roll is the best:  -The location is clean and thankfully does not have that funky fishy smell some other places have. -It's affordable. I always build my own bowl, and a small is only $7! It is enough to fill me up most days.  -Punchcards are offered, buy 10 bowls and get a medium for free!! -Fresh and unique toppings, like daikon radishes. (I do wish mango would get added to the menu though!!) -No upcharge for any toppings, unless you want to double up on crab or avocado.  -Staff is usually very friendly and well trained. On my first visit, it was rather obvious I was dealing with extremely new employees. I have noticed a significant improvement on subsequent visits.   If DIY poke bowls are not your thing, To See Roll also offers up premade sushi and an assortment of other items including desserts and a large variety of drinks. I have yet to try any of these items, but they appear well made and fairly priced.  I haven't tried every one of the new poke spots in town, I can not say that To See Roll is the absolute best. I do know I can get what I want for a great price at To See Roll, so I am a huge fan!",

For the sauce I ask for their sweet yum yum sauce with a little spice of the spicy mayo.  All the sauce and protein are hand mixed and added on top of the brown rice. I add a lil bit of a seaweed salad, avocado and more furikake.  Overall presentation is beautiful and tasty. Best bang for the buck. There are also combos they have here, including miso soup.  They serve sushi rolls also on the side and other oriental goodies.   Customer service is A1",

So when I'm expected to pay for it, you best believe I'm holding these places up to a higher standard. Ok, I like the concept of the already made sushi bar. That's kewl. What's not kewl, having people stroll in around 4pm on a Saturday and there's only a handful of sushi left? What's that about? You could at least keep it going until 7 for the dinner rush? I was so disappointed when I got here especially since that is what I was really looking forward to. Since the sushi was a bust I decided to try their poke bowl and got my little one a miso soup (which is out of a machine -_-). The menu was a little confusing and the person who was helping me wasn't very helpful either. I ended up getting their To see Roll bowl and it was nothing to appealing. It actually had a wasabi taste to it and that killed my mood for it completely. I asked the worker is there is any wasabi in the sauces used for this bowl or anything in the bowl that uses wasabi and he said no. So thought that was weird. My kid took one sip of the soup and pushed it away which is rare since she loves miso soup.  Is this a place i would visit again? I don't know, maybe if I'm in the neighborhood and its early so I can see more of their sushi selection but quite honestly I'm not really going out of my way to come here especially since I live over 25 mins away.",

Love the signature bowl since it comes with Miso soup. Drinks were by can only, would rather prefer fountain drinks with refills. By the way, the Brown Rice is cooked perfectly and very filling. Yum yum sauce is a must and seaweed salad and side of ginger is a must. See you guys soon!!! Thanks for a great meal and experience.",

The Asian guy who took our order was like is it your first time here, and yes it was. I already knew everything I wanted in my bowl except the sauces because they're different from other poke places. I sampled the yuzu sauce which was okay, then he started preparing my bowl and he's like okay what sauce do you want? And I'm like well I don't know yet because you haven't given me the other ones I wanted to try so how would I know. I definitely felt rushed by the employee same with my boyfriend. He was actually finished with his order and was waiting for me to be done so I can pay, and the girl asked my boyfriend are you guys paying separate or together, and as soon as he said together she turns over the iPad as if he was suppose to pay. My $8 was def not worth it for the small bowl that I got.",

The medium is enough food for me, 3 scoops of protein, with crab always included too. Was skeptical of the miso soup because it comes in one of those machines but it is just as good as a cup from a sushi place, and only a $1 add on to the bowl. Haven't tried the sushi but it looks fresh and will the next time which will be very soon. They have a loyalty punch card too. Great ambience for a poke paper plate place and plenty of plugs to charge your devices with free wifi. Will become part of the regular rotation.",

We both got the Build Your Own bowl option you can choose what size you want, what poke, toppings, sauce, and a few other things. It was so customizable and the choices and variety they had was great. We ended up going two days in a row because we liked it so much.

The staff gave us a number and we sat down at the tables waiting. 30 minutes go by and my cousin noticed someone ordered and got their roll quite quickly. He went to the staff asking about our rolls and they forgot/didn't get our order! We thus had to wait a longer time. They apologized, but I felt very disappointed. Our sushi bowls were just in a bag, getting warm. When we got home, I didn't even eat my roll because there were coconut flakes everywhere. Had I known there would be, I would have said no flakes.

    "text": "I've read several reviews comparing the different poke bowls around the valley. Having tried four different locations, I would say this place is one of my favorite.   To be honest, it's one simple reason why I prefer this place over others. What is it? The spicy korean sauce.  There is a Korean version of poke bowl. It's like a poke bowl but has a lot of lettuce mixed in with sashimi, topped with the hot sauce. Why am I telling you this?   The spicy Korean sauce is what makes the Korean poke bowl come together. Which is the glue that is missing in poke bowls in a lot of other places. I've had poke without the Spicy Korean sauce... And preference it may be... But none of the other sauces compare. All the poke bowls I've tried are bland.  This place not only has the spicy sauce but a good variety of fish. It's a lot cleaner and more upscale than some of the other places I have visited. If it tells you how much I enjoy this place, I think I've already visited four times in the past month.   So. Try the poke bowl with spicy sauce. You might understand my obsession with it and the reason why I search out this place versus others.",

The fish is fresh, the staff is friendly, the flavors are EXACTLY what you would expect out of a \"Japanese Poke-style\" restaurant.   The concept is simple... it's like Chipotle for Poke.  Pick your bowl, pick your fish, pick your sauce... mix... ENJOY.  Something like this might cost $20-$30 in a Japanese restaurant, but these bowls around $10 each.  Yum.",
