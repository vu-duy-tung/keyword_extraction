It's a nice lunch hour that makes you feel like you aren't working, and the rest of the day goes by fast because of it.  We'll get a cheeseboard, yellow tail tostatas, lil street tacos, and my work wifey loves the adult grilled cheese.  Other times we've gotten the olive bites in this aioli thing,  sliders, random cocktails.    They have this gluten free chocolate raspberry ganache cake and illy coffee.  It's the perfect after dinner dessert.  I'd rank this as the best lounge, small bites option in Town Square.",

They pour 2.5 oz per three glasses which at first I thought was kind of overpriced but the pours were enough to get a buzz going. Great atmosphere and had the steak frachos which were amazing. The patio is covered and dog friendly. Cigars are available and the cheapest is around $10. Overall it was a pleasant experience and I shall return. It is a bit pricey, but I'm from San Francisco so in retrospect it's a decent enough deal here to return.",

My favorite drinks are the Blood and Sand and the DH Manhattan. But seriously, I have never had a bad cocktail here, so order whatever sounds good to you and I'm sure you'll love it.   Only downside is it's a tad pricey, but it's worth the money without a doubt. Also, it's a cigar bar as well. So steer clear of the patio if you can't stand the smell of smoke.",

More dessert options would be a definite suggestion. This is a great place for me to go to catch up with my girlfriends, we always end up staying (and drinking) for way longer than anticipated :)",

The bar at Yard House had reached its maximum occupancy when my friend and I came down for a few drinks one evening, but fortunately right next door is the Double Helix Wine & Whiskey Lounge.   +Lucky Ray: This fruity concoction consists of pineapple juice, schnapps, grenadine, and Riesling. Fans of sweet drinks might enjoy this cocktail.   +Riesling: I'm not sure what brand of Riesling I ordered, but this one had a slight sweetness.  +Garden Cucumber Martini: Made with gin, basil, and cucumber, my friend ordered three of these for herself; she loved it, but I didn't.  The Double Helix Wine & Whiskey Lounge is laid back and chill in comparison to its neighbor Yard House. Based on my experience, it appears to be a decent place to have a drink or two if you want to avoid the crowds.",

Isn't that how all  good stories start? \"So my friend was visiting from out of town and...\". I think so.   We went for Happy Hour and I was quite pleased with the experience. They really do have an amazing list of whiskey and wine to choose from. I felt a little frazzled, but that's just because I`m neurotic. We opted for some vino; red for her, white for me, and some of their fellini fries(parmesan, truffle aioli, parsley, do it!). The wine was good and those fries hit the spot. I wanted to marry them right then and there.  Service was really good. The girls were friendly and attentive. I felt like we always had water and it was the perfect balance between checking in on us and going away so we could enjoy ourselves. The place itself is really cute and has an inside lounge area with a bar and an outside patio with comfy chairs and couches. Bathrooms are clean and stocked.  Overall, I would definitely come back here. I am waiting for another out of town guest to start a story with.",

I had been in once before during their happy hour and it was packed. Luckly this time we got to sit right down at the bar and it was still happy hour. My friend knew exactly what she wanted, the sangria. I however had no idea what to order. It's a whiskey lounge but I'm not a huge whiskey drinker. I decided to take a look at their specialties. I saw a drink and it had the name Lucky in it so I said i'll have that. I then read on to find out it had riesling, peach schnapps, pineapple juice, and grenadine. the full name was Lucky Ray. Not a huge fan of wine but hell the rest of it sounds good. It came in a cocktail glass and i felt fancy as f@$%! It was also a delicious mix. I was really glad I stopped in. Hope to go back after a movie and grab another one.",

Don't get me wrong, the atmosphere was great, the wine selection was OK, the whiskey choices was amazing, the staff was drop-dead gorgeous... but the food was a joke!  The commercial video I just saw was very misleading. We wanted to start with a couple \"One-Handed\" appetizers. One was deep fried olives stuffed with chorizos, Olive Poppers. The other was the Arancini.  The waitress came with 2 huge plates, and when she set them down, all we saw was half-a-dozen marbles no bigger then green grapes.  Maybe I'm not cultured enough for the $1.50/olive, but the check didn't come fast enough.  It took some restraint on my friend's part. Our sarcastic attempt to make light of the situation did not amuse him at all. We even had to send back the Nutty Mojito.",

But I do think the atmosphere would have been enhanced if there was more of a variety of music. Something hip and alternative maybe.  Service was better than most places in Town Square and the manager was even checking in with diners to make sure they were enjoying themselves. This is almost an anomaly in Vegas it seems, so I thought that was impressive.  I think that the food is a little pricey for the portion sizes you receive and it's hard to convince myself the $12 is worth it for the martinis with Blue Martini being right up the stairs where I can get 1/2 off just for being in the industry. Happy Hour or some other specials would definitely help get people to return.  Overall, I really enjoyed it and would absolutely go back!",

Most of the stores were closed and the sounds coming from the Blue Martini made it seem like more meat market than nightcap, so we opted for the Double Helix.  It seemed like a quieter, more mature crowd on a Thursday night, and we were not disappointed.  Only a few tables were full, along with some folks outside on the patio, but the crowd grew as it got later.  We didn't order food, but loved the cocktail selections.  We settled on a coconut mojito and a Sipping Southern.  Both were sweet, flavorful, and worth a second round.  As a Southern sweet-tea connoisseur, the Sipping Southern would have been better with fresh, homemade sweet tea, but good for a Las Vegas whiskey bar!  The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable, and the customer service was outstanding.  I really appreciated his \"glass of water with everything\" strategy.  I'll definitely go back on my next visit and sample more of the menu.",

    "text": "So last night a friend and I were looking for a place to eat. We were playing it by ear. So upon walking around town square we came upon Double Helix.  IT was pretty crowded at 830 and were greeted by several hostesses which were extremely polite. We were told there would be a 30 minute wait. SO we went to the bar to grab beer, as we were at the bar one one of the Hostess (Manager baybe) came over to the bar and asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar why we waited for the table.  The bartender was extremely friendly  She then came over and told us our table was ready.. I thought this was a nice touch for them being so busy.  They did take my number to text me when the table was ready, however the personal communication was outstanding.    Upon sitting at our table our server came over and greeted us. We still had our beers so she said she would be back in a few to take our order. We then ordered a few things. The Arrenchini and Lobster mac and cheese were outstanding. As we were eating the server checked on us and even the Owner came to our table a few times. We had a quick conversation with him.... Upon finishing our beers the server came back over to ask if we wanted another drink. we asked her opinion on their cocktails.  She suggested one for each of us.  As we were done eating they removed the plates and the owner came back over and talked to us again about our drinks. My friend likes Irish whiskey so the owner and him talked about a couple and he even brought him a small sip of a Irish whiskey.  Great touch...  As we were about to leave we checked in on Facebook and a couple of our friends were in the area  and commented to meet them. We payed our check and left the restaurant.  We then met our friends and we decided to come back and have another cocktail. We got our same table back and same waitress. The owner came back over and mentioned he was trying to say bye the first time but we left so quick. He came and chatted with us again.  GREAT TOUCH. made us feel at home and this was our first time there.   I do not live here in Vegas but my friends do.. We will be back for sure..  Thanks for a great night.. The service at Helix made our night.  THANKS AGAIN!  GREAT JOB.... Keep it up.",

I work in Town square for Tesla and I'm very disappointed for the fact that the bartender would not allow me to drink due to my drivers license being expired a couple days ago because of my birthday despite showing my paper of renewal. I've been coming here a lot with co workers and NEVER been asked to be carded. I'm well over 21 years old and I have the grey hairs to prove that. I understand that this is a normal procedures for most bars to check ID but my message is to the Managers of this restaurant. Please be consistent in asking for IDs for everyone! Because I feel as if I'm being targeted individually due to my race or sexuality by the bartender! There is also a level of compromising with customers as well. No joke my ID expired 3 days ago on my Birthday! My photo looks like me and the ID information are the same that's on the renewal paper. Bars who check ID is to confirm Age and Identity that's it. I would understand if I didn't have my renewal paper on me or an ID that goes with the renewal paper. I will be expressing my frustration to my co workers and the people I meet to avoid coming here in the future.",

Ordered the hummus, taquitos, helix fries, and the blazin sliders. The hummus was bland and weirdly gritty. Ordered the burgers cooked medium but they were over cooked and dry. The fries tasted like they were covered in butter, which was strange to me. The taquitos were fine. The cocktails I ordered were great though. I can not recommend the food, but they have a really nice drink menu.",

I would say what I love about Double Helix is their mix of wines as well as a quality wine selection in a easy to find location within Town Square Mall!   Food: everything is tapas style so we decided on the double triple to try meats and cheeses in the double triple and it as amazing to taste different cheeses and lunch meats including the best prosciutto I've had!   Wine: I tried the double helix red blend that is my new favorite wine! Gary tried the Jameson cast free whiskey.   Service: here's the only thing that prevented me from giving 5 stars: our service was good at first and then super slow. The place wasn't that busy so I wasn't sure what happened but another waitress got my second drink and our bill.  Will we be back? Most definitely and I have friends from home who would love it so I'll give it another shot based on drink selection and food alone.",

    "text": "This place will Whiskey you off your feet.  Town Square is a bit of a hodge-podge. Since it's not too far away from the glitz of The Strip, one side of the street may cater more to tourists -- higher end name brands -- along with a price tag to match. The other side will have eateries, local businesses, neat-o nick-nack shops, and things like parks and splash pads; clearly geared towards the locals.   Double Helix harmonizes the same melody as it's host: there are plenty of items, specials, and pure, unadulterated goodness to please everyone's tastes -- along with a tremendous HH menu. Locals need not be afraid of entering \"The Vortex\" that Las Vegas Boulevard can be -- the prices are always fair.   The best way to approach a visit would be to grab some of the apps and libations during Happy Hour. Held from 3:30PM - 7:30PM, it includes some solid small plates, such as the wonderfully delicate arancini. This is a MUST for me, literally every single visit. The fried risotto fritters boast a smooth marscapone & roasted mushrooms, which are great on their own. The moment they take a slide through the truffle aioili, they transcend to another level. The crisp outside gives way to the creaminess on the inside. Dragonballs for the appetite!  The Happy Hour menu also offers half priced specials on select wines, whiskeys, and cocktails. The $4 Reisling is quite good -- a nice balance of flavors; not too sweet. The reds are also surprisingly good for the prices. These aren't bottles of Barefoot or a box under the bar.  As if this wasn't enough, they also offer some very nice beer flights with varying degrees of price and quality, and even a three course prix-fixe brunch on the weekends.   Offering several items for several different tastes, Double Helix is cemented as a destination I'll continue to hit!",

Double Helix has a great HH in terms of timing (from open until 7:30pm).  A HH ending at 7:30pm is almost unheard of in Vegas.  They have a couple of beer and cocktail deals for under $6 and then about 6 appetizers to choose from for around $6-8 a piece.  The drink selection was fine - nothing amazing.  I had the apple cocktail and enjoyed it but wouldn't pay sticker price of $12.  The food was actually pretty average.  Portion sizes were very small so coming here outside HH would probably require at least 3 dishes to suitably get full.  They have a nice whiskey selection and a few tvs to watch the game, but I think Double Helix is a little classed-up; a bar to the tune of Yard House or McFadden's next door is more in my wheel house.",

The hummus should be sold in stores. The veggies were a bit wilted and should have included cucumber and celery but the hummus was so exceptional that it is merely a mention and not criticism.

After scanning the scene for a new restaurant to try, we picked this one because of the late happy hour.  The ambiance was really fun. Kinda dark. Kinda mysterious. Enough excitement happening around to sit back and really enjoy the food and drinks. It is definitely a drinks and apps type place and not as great for a sit down meal.  What we got:  The Red Sangria (4 stars): great fresh fruit chunks and refreshing flavor The hummus app (2-3 stars): Very basic hummus plate with pita and some carrots. Hate to say it, but I enjoy Trader Joe's hummus better. The grown up grilled cheese (4 stars): 4 pieces of tasty melted cheese with some extra grown up flavors. Very good! The BBQ Pork Sliders (5 stars): Seriously, these sliders were amazing! So good that we ordered another round of them after all the other food! Great flavor, nice balance of elements, simply delicious.  The service was quick and friendly, and we definitely did not have to worry about getting to our movie on time. Definitely worth the trip!",

He also got the bacon sliders, which he enjoyed, but his medium-rare was more like a medium-well.  I got the steak frites, which I loved.  My medium came out perfect & the fries were delicious.  I hated having to share this dish with my boyfriend ;p  Our bill was $36 for the two tapas & one meal (no drinks), so decently priced.  Next time I also wanna try the adult grilled cheese!

Happy hour specials get you $3-$6 appetizers, $3 beers, $4-$7 wines, ~$5 cocktails, as well as 1/2 off premium well drinks (what's a premium well?) and 1/2 off their whiskey of the month.  After several visits here I've found myself enjoying their grilled cheese and arancini appetizers the most.  Gruyere and smoked ham make for a tasty grilled cheese, and the arancini comes with a good truffle sauce.  The food isn't amazing, but these are the two dishes that I've liked most.  As far as drinks, talk with Jessica if you're sitting at the bar.  She's a good bartender that is always happy to make you a drink based on your mood and palate.  Otherwise, their happy hour cucumber martini is delicious, and made with Hendricks Gin!    Decent food and good drinks make for a nice stop at Town Square.",

A lot of plush leather seating, clean tables, and the outside patio has a beautiful fire fixture that keeps you warm on nights when straight whiskey just isn't warming enough.  The drinks menu is well designed, offering explanations of the whiskey and their locations of origin.  This is perfect for those, like myself, that are interested in trying new types and want to learn more about what they're drinking.  There's even a map so you can visualize the area you're drinking from.  The food here was surprising.  During their happy hour, offerings are decently cheap and yet don't take away from the quality.  I often order the prosciutto and cheese platters, and so far its only ever been disappointing once.  Every other time I've ordered it, save the last time, the prosciutto has been high quality and a perfect item option to pair with the high quality liquor.    Minus one star for the last visits food quality, and a small lapse in service where I caught the waitress texting for ten minutes rather than serving the few customers in the place for lunch, I've always been pleased with the service and food quality.  I have, and will continue to bring friends back to this place to enjoy the unique whiskey and food combinations.",

The big plus for us was the outdoor patio that allowed our huge dog...and they were super friendly and served him water too.   The seating was pretty cramped, but not a big deal. Love the loungey, relaxed vibe of the restaurant.",

The soap dispenser was turned upside down on the wall . I asked for the manager who was the bartender too. She said she had just heard about and was trying to fix it .

Starting with the horrible attitude of the hostess (shorter, dark hair, glasses) and finishing with the waitress (taller, dark hair, glasses), who completely ignored our party while chomping on her gum, it was a huge disappointment.    After sitting for 15 minutes with no contact from her we flagged her down and asked her if we could order food.  She shook her head yes (didn't even have enough respect to speak to us).  We waited 30 minutes and she never returned to take an order.  We flagged her down again and asked for our check but she never brought it.  We had to ask another employee to bring us our check and then we went to Yard House to eat.  In a town built on hospitality it is a shame that there are people who still don't understand that they are in the \"service\" industry.  If you don't like taking care of guests then this is the wrong business for you.  The guest is the reason for your work, they are not an interruption of your work.  Hopefully the management will care enough to address the issues because they have a great venue with some staff members who don't care about their business and are costing them revenue.",

We were surprised when they allowed the little ones in so we sat down, ordered happy hour food and drinks.  It wasn't busy for a week day and the server was very tentative and very sweet, the owner even came by for a quick hello, which was much appreciated.  We sat in a booth in the corner of the restaurant, which was perfect considering we had little ones with us. The food was perfect for what we needed and price was on par with all the other restaurants and spots in Town Square. We ordered cocktails and enjoyed ourselves with conversations and the subtle music playing in the back ground.  It's perfect for a quick bite, a brief break from the daily stressors, a girls or boys night out, or a break from shopping. I know it's a whiskey and wine bar but we mainly came in for something quick and simple. Will be back for another quick one! Kuddos!!",

Kyle, the bartender, is one of the best in Vegas! There needs to be a better title, because to call him a bartender is a disservice to what he does because he is not only a magician with the cocktails, he also eloquently lays out what goes into each drink and what kind of taste to expect in such a way that both pleases the veteran drinker and informs the novice. He does this without ever sounding condescending, which is an attitude you see far too often in Las Vegas. My girl and I were pleased to have his expertise and humour, and he's definitely what we'd consider an irreplaceable asset to this particular location! Seeing as how he's been a fixture there for at least the few years I've been going there, the ownership probably agrees with that sentiment. I've honestly never had the food here, so I cannot comment on that. The environment is pleasant and the crowd is pretty good. Never seen any dramas or problems. Great place for a happy hour drink or impress your FarmersOnly date with a big city cocktail list.",

    "text": "Located inside the Palazzo on the 2nd floor in the middle of the mall, this place was one of our favorite places to grab a glass of Wine or Beer when we lived in Vegas.  During our recent trip back to town, we decided to stop by here for a couple of drinks before we went to The Act Nightclub.  First of all, we were happy to see that it was still in business.  Half of us ordered a glass of Wine and the other half ordered a chalice of Stella.  We hung out for about an hour and enjoyed the people watching.  Since it's located in one of the main intersections of the mall, you can see people walking around in all directions.  There were also several characters hanging out at the bar, which were fun to watch.  If you're looking for a place to have a nice glass of Wine and Beer, give this place a shot.  They also deliver to all hotels on the Strip, so take a look at their Wine menu and if there's a bottle you like, they'll take it to you.  Return Factor - 90%",

The bartenders are engaging and the servers are friendly and attentive!    My favorite time to go to Double Helix is at night when the lights are dim, but I also enjoy sitting outside on the patio while absorbing the sunshine in the afternoon.    Note: Double Helix also serves apps too!  My favorite are the olive poppers!",

I'm a big whiskey enthusiast and this is the only place in Vegas that i've found with such a great selection. They have over 50 different types of whiskey and the categorize it by region. If you ask about the different regions the bartenders are able to tell you the differences.   The best thing about this place is they have a whiskey of the month that is half off during happy hour. This isn't like half off Jack Daniels, its high quality whiskey at a great price. They also have excellent food and a great happy hour (3:30-7!). It's more fine american dining type food and atmosphere. I highly recommend the Pork Sliders. The sauce is amazing!  The staff is great as well. I have been multiple times and never had any issues and they've always been very friendly.   I haven't been here for dinner, but I feel I need to go. For whiskey lovers out there, this is your place.",

I do wish, though, that the serving portions were a little larger because I'm a hungry, hungry lady. The main reason this place only gets four stars from me because the service can be shotty. I love the bartenders and usually get great service at the bar. But, sometimes my group will choose to sit outside and some of the servers are great, but some of them can be pretty rude and take a while. On multiple occasions we've noticed them openly talking about other customers which just isn't cool. Get it together ladies.",

    "text": "My wife, roommate, and I tried this place for the first time Saturday night after our wine walk. The hostess was very sweet and we were seated fairly quickly considering how busy it looked. Our server was nice, we ordered our drinks first. Came out in a timely manner. And then we had a few appetizers.   Ordered the Prosciutto platter (I think it was), and the Bri (if I remember correctly), and the fries. Our server warned us the Bri would take 15min or so to make, which we were fine with. We actually got that first before our basic fries. In fact, we finished it first before receiving our fries. Our server was missing at this point, so I had to ask some random server about our fries. Within minutes they showed up.   We then asked to be seated out on the patio so we can smoke our cigar for the first time. It was nice seating near the fire pit. Our server was attentive now, and showed us how to properly smoke a cigar.   I took off a star because according to our server they were a bit understaffed. Apparently another server was able to leave earlier in the night. My suggestion is DO NOT cut anyone on a Saturday night especially when there is an event going on in Town Square. Aka Wine Walk.   Would I recommend? Sure if in the area. But it didn't leave a lasting impression for me to return.",

I tasted more whiskey than wine and it was more of a whiskey drink than it was a sangria drink. I wasn't that crazy about it. I can also say that I am disappointed about the new happy hour menu of food items which isn't as good as it used to be, but the small shredded beef tacos and hummus plate were good. It is not as good as it used to be and it is not likely that I will come back here again. There are other places to choose from that are much better and many new places that have opened around in that area that I have not tried yet. The service was good and we had a very nice person as our waitress.",

About 5-10 more minutes goes by, our waitress arrives with a large platter of cocktails for our party and then a few for other patrons. We continue sipping our drinks, never to see the waitress again. So, we decided to move on.  I personally wasn't too upset that our drinks weren't replenished every couple minutes, but our  friends were definitely annoyed.  Would appreciate better service next time, but whatever.",

    "text": "DH has been bookmarked forever and my gf and I were glad to find out that they have happy hour everyday from 3:30-7:30. DH has an extensive drink menu, mostly (you guessed it!) wine & whiskey. However their happy hour left my friends and I feeling pretty hungry still.   Happy hour food prices here are a bit high compared to the portion size, but then again DH does serve mainly tapas. We ordered the tacos, 2 for $7. They came out hot with a super soft tortilla and well seasoned pork. I'd definitely order this again if I come back. Most of the food on the happy hour menu is only a dollar or two off their regular menu price so I'm not sure if its worth it. Like other reviewers said, if you come hungry, you'll probably leave hungry unless you spend a lot.   Wine & sangria are about $5. I was hoping that they would have white sangria, but its made with red wine so I passed. Their apple fizz $6, was pretty tasty. The first few sips didn't taste like alcohol at all but towards the end it was pretty strong. The Whisky mule is made with lemon juice. I wish they added some mint to it. Also, I could hardly taste the whisky in the drink... not sure if that's good or bad!  We had some drinks and tacos and decided to head over to lazy dog for dinner. With so many other happy hour spots in Vegas, DH won't be on the top of my list unless I have a whiskey loving friend in town.",

The patio is a great place to enjoy drinks, but can be hard to secure a seat on a popular day.  They have a good happy hour menu, but I will say that the menu isn't too extensive or versatile. Don't get me wrong, there are great items to snack on, but if you come here often, I imagine the options get old. Lots of fried things for the happy hour menu. Options aren't too fulfilling if you're hungry.   While I enjoy this place and don't want it to go anywhere, we prefer to come here for happy hour with friends or a before-movie drink, rather than a sit down meal.",

    "text": "I've been putting off this review in hopes that the poor service I've received here were one-off scenarios, but it's clear that they are not. I really wanted to like this place; the food and drinks are great but this place gets a 1 star for service.   I checked this place out for the first time about a year ago with a friend, and the service we had was terrible. Our server rushed us, proceeded to take my friends order and then WALKED AWAY before I could order my food and drink - what??? So when she finally came back around to my table, I let her know that she didn't even ASK me what I was ordering before she walked away. Our server proceeded to ignore us until we finally had to chase someone else down to close out the check.  Poor experience #2: I came here with my boyfriend about 6 months later after we happened to receive a gift card. I assumed that the crappy experience my friend and I received was a one-off. Towards the end of our meal, our server disappeared AGAIN. We waited and finally flagged her down to order dessert. After ordering with her, we waited a full 30 minutes (no exaggeration) and dessert never came out. Finally, we flagged down another server to let them know we were still waiting. When our original server finally showed up, she explained that the kitchen \"messed up on the dessert\" and will be another 20 minutes - which is nonsense, it was clear by how flustered she was that she forgot to put our order in. We told her to forget it, we closed out our check and left.  Poor (and final) experience #3: I came here for the last time two days ago with my same friend from my first visit. I had a little left on my gift card and they were having a happy hour, so we figured we would give it a go. I couldn't possibly have bad service 3 times in a row, right? Wrong. We waited about 15 minutes for our server, who we realized was the young blonde who walked in clearly LATE for her shift through the front doors. When we finished our food and drinks, we let her know we weren't ordering anything else and we'd like our check. We waited. And waited. And waited. At this point, my friend and I were laughing. It was the same experience as we've had prior. Finally we had to flag down a different server to close out our check, as ours would literally walk right past our table and ignore us - several times.   I don't know what this business is trying to be. Do the employees think they're too good for everyone else to provide solid, attentive service? Whatever it may be, I'm not coming back, and I hope management sees this and pivots.",

The Double Helix is a great lounge for both snackers and whiskey lovers alike. This spot is located in the main hub of Town Square and they feature over one hundred whiskeys and an entire vineyard's worth of wines, both red and white.    Instead of just staring at their vast drink menu, I suggest going with a \"drink flight\", this is the best way to find out exactly what you do and don't like and yes, they offer whiskey and wine flights for the indecisive person. They also have great happy hour deals that usually highlight a specialty whiskey or wine. If you really want to get educated on whiskey ask for Kyle, one of the bartenders, he's the hunky guy in the Kilt. The dude is legit when it comes to drink suggestions and whiskey anecdotes.   Hummus, quesadillas, and fried cheese is just a small sample of the snacks they offer here, they also have excellent charcuterie plates to go with that bold red in your hand.   Sip smart Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I'm giving 2 stars based on the wine and quality of food. Wine was great, a little expensive aside from HH.. food tasted great, but when they say tapas-they mean TINY tapas. But nonetheless that all tasted great.  My main problem is I would give ZERO stars based on service alone. I was meeting a friend around 5:30 and I arrived before she did. The male host who sat me immediately got me waters while I waited. I did not see any waitress for over 10 minutes. Once she came over to me she said \"I'm assuming you're waiting for your friends?\" I said yes, and she would return once my friend arrived. My friend arrives, and 15 minutes later we get greeted by a very frantic and busy server, who then took our food and wine order. We could tell she was overwhelmed but her lack of knowledge about the menu was unacceptable! I asked for a couple of the sauces listed on the entrees to be placed on the side, and I'm her broken English she said she didn't understand what I was asking. I had to point to the menu and explain what I was asking, she wrote our order down and ran off. Our wine did not get to our table until maybe 10-12 minutes later, they were busy, so that was understandable. But then.. 25 minutes after placing our order, our (frantic) server comes to ask us what we ordered! It arrived about 15 minutes later, so about 40 minutes from initial placement with our server. After a couple hours of visiting, we were ready to close out. My friend and I split the check, she paid cash and I would put the remaining balance on my credit card. This server then proceeded to ask me if I could give her all cash because she \"already closed out my table\"!! First of all, not my problem. I would have given more cash if I had it, but giving my card I obviously didn't, she then said she would \"figure it out\" and my card was charged appropriately. But I was appalled that she asked me to give her cash in the first place. From start to finish, AWFUL service from this waitress who's name I regretfully did not get.",

Anyway, I was very excited to finally try this place out.  The ambiance was great, it was a big more upscale than the other bars around that area.  Music was tolerable - you can still have a decent conversation.  This is what we had:  Helix (house brand, I assume): Merlot and Pinot Noir ... it was very decent wines that we ordered 3 glasses each!  The food (let me see if I remember)  Pulled pork sliders: Sauce was not overwhelming (ie: messy) BUT they could have put more on the side just so we can add more to our liking.    Fried Olives: breaded perfectly (not oily and totally crispy).  If not mistaken it as kalamata olives.  Compot ACO (I think I got that right): The jams were tasty, wished they added more fruits and the cheese was great compliment to the Pinot I was drinking)  Skirt Steak: YUMMM!  Perfectly cooked for a thin strip of meat - it was still red in the middle - good job!  Hummus: Really liked this one.  Flavorful, not overwhelming and the added fruits (?) in the hummus sweetened up the bite.  The bread was thin and not overwhelming.  Margherita Flatbread: Crust was thin (brunt to a crisp on the sides).  Might want to watch it while in the oven.  The basil was very fresh (last minute addition) which brightened it up really nicely.  Would love more mozzarella.   a Chocolate Cake (I forgot the name): very rich, you can really taste the cocoa and coffee.  It was a great ending to the meal.  I must say, we ate a lot here...",

The service was attentive and our drinks weren't empty long before a waitress came to our aid. Lots and lots of whiskey choices from around the world. This was a big hit with my husband. He had a lot of fun trying different kinds. Price is moderate. Did not try the food- but smelled appetizing. Nice selection of finger food to enjoy with drinks.",

It was a Tuesday, so only a few people were there. Sat at the bar and enjoyed a nice glass of wine and had a very pleasant conversation with the bartender. She recommended that I stop back by later since happy hour ran till 7:30p, and advised that the food was really good.   Around 7p, we were ready for dinner, so decided to swing back around to Double Helix. There was nobody at the hostess desk, nor a sign about whether to wait or seat yourself, so being a nice night, we ventured out to the patio. We sat there for HALF AN HOUR without a single acknowledgement from the server or busboy. No silverware, no drinks, no menus. And not for lack of trying on our parts. Short of tackling the server, she simply had no interest in waiting on our table. It's clear that this place has more interest in hiring hot girls than quality servers.   Upon leaving, there was a petite gal at the hostess desk who thanked us for coming in, but I corrected her and told her that we were leaving because we were ignored for 30 minutes. She just said, \"sorry\". No mention of calling over a manager, or anything to try to change our minds to stay.  I give 2 generous stars because the happy hour at the bar with the delightful bartender was a nice experience. But that's the only thing I can say about this place. If you're hungry, seriously go someplace else.",

I called and found out their happy hour goes until 7:30 pm, yay! So we stopped by and ordered some small plates and adult beverages. I had never had the food prior and was impressed! Will definately be back soon. I will say their couch/love-seat chair seating is very uncomfortable, especially while dining. Good idea, but I would suggest taking those out and putting more small tables in.",

On the surface, a wine and whiskey lounge with a happy hour menu sounds great.    However...  This place seemed pretty confused to me.  There didn't seem to be any real connection to any of the menu items.  The decor was clearly expensive, but not attractive.  Prices were high (it seemed) on whiskey, and their drink special that day was Wild Turkey, which hardly seems special to me.  Waitresses dressed trashy as did the hostesses.  I can see how this might have allure in some contexts, but it just seemed out of place here.  The music was loud and really bass heavy, which would have seemed appropriate if they had a dance floor - but this is just a tiny little bar.  I don't know, maybe I missed something or just didn't \"get it\". I would probably be willing to give it another chance, but I am currently unimpressed with Double Helix.",

The staff had a very good attitude, but it did take a little time for them to give you attention. There is an outdoor sitting area with fireplaces that weren't turned on. We did try out some of the snacks and they were good. I didn't (check) or see if they had any gluten free options in the happy hour snacks so that's a little bit of a negative.  The margaritas were served in mason jars which was cute and they were tasty. Good place to sit around and chat with friends.",

When we arrived, it was early evening well before a dinner rush & we were seated right away. The food was awesome, service was knowledgeable & friendly.   Here's the rub. It was a Sunday, once football kicked off the music went down & the TV sound went up full blast. We asked if the football commentary was going to but audible for the whole game, our server has to go ask & returned to tell us that yes, on \"this night\" the game would be on.   Here's my gripe. If we wanted to have a football game blasting over the speakers, we would have gone to a sports bar. Unfortunately, it prompted us to get our check & leave. We were really enjoying the food, drink & service but this is not what we signed up for. Maybe we'll try again, off season.",

She upsold me on a lesser known whiskey, which was a delightful introduction to my palate. The food was amazing and delicious. I highly recommend the arancini! Brooke provided efficient and professional service that not only impressed my date but also surpassed my own expectations. I would recommend this place to all my family and friends with the hope that Brooke will be there to guide them through the delicious menu.",

    "text": "I love this type of Bistro. But the waitress was clueless, an unattentive.. We went for Happy Hour Thursday, and the wine pour is like half of a normal pour, so you really aren't saving money. $6.00 a glass, so your getting probably 6 glasses out of one bottle equaling $36.00 so your making a killing.  My husband drinks IPA beer, and the happy hour IPA was out, so did they substitute?  No. We had to pay full price which was 21.00 for 3 small glasses.  That's not good service...My girlfriend ordered asaid I  well scotch and water, and they charged full price~~~and had to argue with the waitress over why isn't Happy Hour, she was oh we don't have Happy Hour price for Scotch ,What???   Really, let your customers no this.  Just crazy ... Your local customers  aren't coming back with that.  Lord Flemings gives a better pour. The charcuterie was very very thin sliced, and the cheese portion was smaller then what Delta serves on the plane. The atmosphere, the bar is really awesome.  You need to bump up your pours and your small bites, and your place could be the **locals go to bar***",

He was fair and offered great suggestions for  small plates to have ready for the group when we arrived.   We were planning on having the party around the firepit, but strong gusty winds forced us inside.  I was so worried there wouldnt be room for my group of 15 but Michael made it happen and reserved a large table for all of us.   His ability to accommodate a last minute change like that is an example of excellent customer service.    The food was great, the arincinis are my favorite.  The whiskey was even better and Michael even sent over a birthday drink for my boyfriend while we sang to him.   Jessica our waitress was attentive and offered suggestions for drinks when asked.   Would highly recommend this place for a small gathering or even just a date night - they really excel in customer service.",

The only food we ordered this time was the fried oreos since we had just eaten dinner. I would recommend these if you are looking for a dessert. I mean it's fried and it's a cookie-how can you go wrong?  I have ordered pretty much everything from their happy hour food menu in the past and you can't really go wrong. My favorite is probably the Arancini out of everything. If you are looking to only get one thing I would recommend that.   They indoor and outdoor seating. During the winter you can sit by a fire pit which I haven't tried yet but is on my to do list!",

The indoor seating sucks so be sure to snag a seat outside! They have a pretty extensive wine/whiskey list and a short list of your usual cocktails.  Decent happy hour, menu with food- however more of a place to grab drinks than eat. It's located in the center of Town Square, in front of the movie theatre, next to Yard House, catty corner to Yogurtland. Parking behind the movie theatre gets you the closest :)",

This seems like a nice place to take a date, maybe order some wine and a cheese platter (which looks amazing). It's dimly lit, and has a kind of romantic vibe. A few friends and I met here for Sunday brunch and sat inside. They do have a patio, but it was as bit chilly to sit outside. I will be sitting out there when the weather gets warmer though.   So they have a small brunch menu, which has a few appetizers and a couple entrees. For an appetizer I went with the crispy olives stuffed with chorizo and honey goat cheese. Sounds delicious right? Well these things were TINY. I guess I expected a larger olive to hold all of the filling. I couldn't taste any chorizo and could faintly taste the goat cheese. I wouldn't order these again. For my meal I ordered the veggie omelet which was delicious! It had seasonal veg, although I don't remember what exactly, and fontina cheese, and it came with a side of potatoes. It wasn't too much food, but it was just enough. My friends ordered the steak and eggs which looked ridiculous juicy and delicious, I will definitely be getting that next time.",

Their happy hour was in full swing and we all ordered from that at first.  After the first round three of us ordered from the salad section and we were each pleased with the plates.  They were good sized portions for the cost which was around $5 each.    The only hiccup of the evening was when the bill came and they had double or triple charged us for some items.  However they correct it quickly and apologized saying their system was having issues.  I would definitely come back again to enjoy the happy hour or try some of their wine flights.",

The menu was simple everything is reasonably priced; we could tell that their main focus was drinks and the food was a little more fancier than the usual bar food. We ordered the Long Island iced tea, Jameson Mule, Shortie tacos, and Fellini fries. We downed our first round of drinks and hoped our food wouldn't take too long...but 30-45 mins to almost an hour we waited for our food; It was shortly after that the manager came out to our table and apologized, offered to cover our second round of drinks (which we took advantage of). Our food came out, hoping it would be a decent size; the tacos came in 3 (finger food size) and the Fellini fries were better than the tacos ): Although our server was super nice and our water refills was on point; I'll give this place 2 stars. Maybe I'll change my whole view of this place, if I stop by in time for their bottomless brunch!",

On this visit they had $2 tacos but we decided to order items off the menu and everything was really good.  The little burgers were ok, the pesto was amazing on it and the fried cheese was good as well, the burgers were just ok.  We also had fried risotto balls and they were AMAZING.  The only complaint was the bartender.  I ordered a mojito and she forgot to put the grenadine in the drink.  First off, the bar was not that busy and if she would have focused on her job instead of wanting to chat with another lady sitting at the bar, maybe she would do her job better.  She seemed more interested in chatting and acting like a customer instead of a bartender.    What was even worse is that instead of telling me they forgot an ingredient, both the server and the bartender hoped I would not notice.  REALLY???  This girl needs a new career and anything with drinks is NOT it.  The second drink I ordered supposedly had all the ingredients, but it just did not taste the same.    I like this place however if I come in again and see this girl bartending, I will not order anything from the bar.  IF there is no way to get a drink without going through the bar, I will go somewhere else.  I don't care for dishonest people and this girl was trying to be dishonest instead of taking responsibility for her negligence.     Aside from the bartender everything else was good.",

    "text": "When your mom is in town and says she wants to have a few drinks and \"eat light\" there aren't very many places that come to mind. Double Helix is the kind of bar that a lot of other cities take for granted, and Las Vegas' equivalent is a PTs. It's a great place to go for an early evening cocktail and light dinner. Since it's in a shopping center it's also a great place for a light lunch on a shopping trip. The main downside to Double Helix is that it is in a shopping center so I hardly ever come here as a local (even if it is a \"locals\" shopping center).   DRINKS: My mom ordered the ABC wine flight and I ordered The Last Samurai cocktail. The Last Samurai was $16 which is pretty damn expensive. However, when I realized the cheapest Japanese whisky on the menu is $12, I figured fine I may as well have a cocktail. Can't be ordering a cheap Japanese whisky for fear of getting judged by the bartender. The bartender informed me that the cocktail is different now than the menu's description and he sort of alluded that it's a \"dessert cocktail.\" That almost made me not order it but I did anyways. It wasn't overly sweet, sort of similar to a Manhattan. It actually reminded me of those chocolate oranges in foil that come in slices. I guess they got rid of the grapefruit part of it, which is what caught my eye in the first place. I would probably order this again if I knew I only wanted one drink all night.   FOOD: Since we went on a Thursday we got a free Arancini with the flight my mom ordered. The Arancini is basically 6 fried risotto balls. It tasted like truffle mac and cheese inside so.. very good and even better free. We also ordered the Shortie tacos and the Blazin' sliders to share. The Shortie tacos' short ribs were AMAZING. I want all my tacos to have this meat. My only complaint was the tacos ended up looking pretty empty, they could have put more filling in them for sure. The Blazin' sliders were surprisingly really spicy, but I like that. It's the perfect amount for two people. The fried yucca sticks were basically tortilla strips. I think they could have given us a little more of these too, or just left them off altogether.   If you can get here for Happy Hour, that's the way to go because the prices are borderline too high for what you get. Keep in mind you can order tacos for a few dollars cheaper and burgers for a few dollars more (with fries) next door at Yardhouse. I like Double Helix because it's an upscale bar with better-than-average bar food and it's not smoky and doesn't have video poker all over the bar. Sure, it's in a shopping center, but it allows you to escape Vegas for a bit and pretend you're in San Diego or somewhere chic-er than here. It's still a great option for first dates, girl's night pregames, happy hours, or light dinners with cocktails.",

I had seen this spot before she at Town Square so we decide to check it out.   Upon entry the hostesses greeted us. We chose to sit at the bar. Our bartendar welcomed us and took our drink order.   They have a huge selection of whiskeys and wine from all over the world. It was great to have such a variety. They offered flights as well, Yay!!!! I started with a cucumber garden martini, very refreshing and light. Then moved on to the around world red wine flight. Loved the Bordeaux it was a blend so it was easy to drink.   They have happy hour everyday till 7:30. Longest happy hour I've seen, especially on a Friday and Saturday. The happy hour menue isn't very big but we opted to try a few of the items.   Arancini, vegan hummus and yellowfin tuna were my favorites.  We tried the olive poppers which were a bit odd, different however. The stuffed jalapeno was quite large and filling. Smoked Duck charcuterie wasn't our favorite, tasted a bit processed.   The ambiance is nice, they offer seating out on the patio around a fire pit which can be a fun place for a friendly gathering.",

    "text": "Alright, kind of hammered as I write this review thanks to Double Helix.  Going to review on drink tips for now because that's all I had tonight.  Once again, just the tips.=)   This is my 1st review hammered, but regardless, I'm always honest af..so let's do this....  Service: Our server Kristin was so sweet..  She was totally cool with explaining the wine flights order a 2nd time as my buddy snapped it.  she just started watching game of thrones and we made sure we didn't mess up her show by talking about the recent seasn.  All I know is that Khaleesi's army is super extra....as was Kristin taking care of us.  Drinky Drinks I sampled tonight, was feeling whisky then moved to gin... 1) Last Samurai = Suntory Whisky Toki + amaro + scrappy's grapefruit bitters + topped with lemon juice  2) New York Sour = Wine-Spiked Whiskey Sour 3) Last Word = DH Barrel aged In + green chartreuse + maraschino liquor + fresh lime juice  The Last Samurai & NY Sour were tasty af and got me hammered quickly.  The Last mf Samurai was my favorite, by far.  I like their style.  For whatever reason, I switched to the Last Word with Gin for my last drink, word.  Little too sweet and overwhelming for me, kinda like my last couple of relationships but like this drink, got my last one in, said goodbye and we both moved on amicably.   Just let it go, so something new can enter your life..ijs..  Value: $16, $15, $11 were the prices of the 3 drinks I had.  Tasty and less than a bad lap dance/decision in vegas. So I've heard...  Ambiance: Intimate, couches and conversation.  This is where you can find all 3.  Chilling on the couch + booze = stimulates good conversation with good peeps.    Summary: Although blitzed, I know good service and drinks when I experience it.  Thanks to the staff for hosting a great night as we entertained our close friend from out of town. Double Helix's casting couch is a great place for conversation and to catch up for drinks.  Time to hit up some food and update this review in the near future. Respect...  .",

Double Helix makes fabulous drinks, I won't say anything bad about that I love the various cocktails & whiskey but the service needs improvement.  It was not very busy, during happy hour we ordered we two drinks and two entrees, the waiter forgot to add one of the food items. If it was busy I can understand, it can get loud there can be room for misunderstanding but this waiter felt he was going through the motions. The tacos were good, but I felt they were soggy because they kept falling apart. Afterwards we chose to pay the bill and go to Yard House for burgers.",

    "text": "Came here for HH for a friend's birthday- the focus is definitely on the wine and whiskey, and the food is secondary so plan on a meal ahead of time or opt for the cheese or charcuterie plates. Location is large but maintains an intimate atmosphere and service puts them a step above other options in the area.  We shared a bunch of appetizers but nothing stood out as especially good- the tacos got raves from some in our group while the arancini stood out to others, but the taquitos, fried olives, and stuffed pepper dishes were not something I'd order again.  Our group of 6 was welcomed by Michael, an owner or manager who is crazy-nuts about wine. He came over and let us sample one of his favorite pinot noirs, not yet available on the menu, and spoke with us extensively about it- his passion for wine was palpable, and is a large part of why I'll be recommending this spot to other winos.",

    "text": "A lovely couple Rach & Adrian, recommended Double Helix for happy hour and turned out to be a great decision for Lavi's birthday and new job!    Original plans completely changed last minute.  Even so, not knowing exactly how many attendees would show, we were able to get a table which accomodated our group - no reservation; and were seated almost immediately.  Great regards to our lovely couple friends (my new daughters - inside joke).  Indoor and outdoor seating is available.  There are bar height tables, regular tables, lounge couch seating, and bar seating.  The decor is super cute.  I love the lamps in this place.    The happy hour menu is really cool.  HH includes wines, whiskeys, and pretty good appetizer options.  The tacos get my vote!  The truffle risotto balls are good too.  I tried the whiskey mule... smackering sourness... get me a drool bib!  I'd say I'll just stick to an original or a raspberry ginger beer with J.D.    Leaving out the cons in this review, as overall the experience here was good.  And I'd return for happy hour hangouts with fun friends.  I'm not a smoker, but this is also a cigar bar.  Michael, the General Manager was extremely generous to acknowledge Lavi's birthday and introduced a new wine that just came out on their menu October 1st.  Much gratitude sir; you made her night extra special.    Also, the pinot noir that was introduced to us was definitely thumbs up.  I had only tasted a French wine at a thanksgiving dinner once; didn't capture me.  This Bourgogne, changed my thoughts.  It's really pleasant; not heavy - especially the after taste.  Wonderful introduction, thanks to you!  Cheers to many more new and all sorts of celebrations!",

Food came out very quick, and excellent service from all of the staff.   We pretty much ordered everything on the menu and liked all of them. Especially the tacos, meat was super tender and great flavors. The mushroom and truffle oil fritters were amazing! Had to order a second order. The tuna on taro chip was also really good! Their regular menu is not that expensive either. We ordered mushroom ravioli - the sauce was delicious!! The meatballs were also really good, meatballs were super soft and tons of flavors, garlic knots that came with it was fluffy and flavorful - dipped these in the ravioli sauce and OMG - heaven in my mouth!   Will definitely come back for happy hour! Wanted to try their beignets but was too stuff - so obviously I will have to come back for the beignets...and the fritters...and the tacos...and everything else!!",

I love that the wine of the month is half off on Wednesday's and their happy hour goes late until 7:30 pm.   The four of us shared the three meat & three cheese charcuterie board and I also had one of the bang bang jalapenos. I loved the bang bang, very different and not too overly spicy. For the cheeses I definitely recommend the goat cheese and Gouda. The prosciutto was my favorite of the meats.   Overall this place was pretty good, the service was a bit slow which was the only reason for a 4 rather than 5 star, but I'd come back again.",

They also have a patio, which seems like the best place to sit and sip on a glass of vino.  I stopped in here randomly because I've been meaning to check it out for awhile.  The bartender was friendly....maybe a little TOO friendly, if that is possible.  I don't like people I don't know (who are providing me with service) to address me by \"baby\" and things like that.  She was just kind of weird.  The food looked pretty wine bar standard....flat breads, charcuteries, cheeses, etc.  I didn't eat, but it looked good.  I had 2 glasses of red wine, and when I received my check, it was a bit more than I was expecting.  The bartender explained that the price I was expecting was for 1/2 glasses and I was getting full glasses (I didn't realize this was an option, and would have MUCH rather had the 1/2 glass).  It was, of course, on the menu, so it was my mistake.  However, it would have been nice if she would have clarifyed this with me when I ordered.  She was more interested in other patrons, who she apparently knew and were ordering shots.  Also, they didn't have a closing time listed on the door, and there was a pretty good sized crowd in the place....but they just decided to close at Midnight.  Suddenly they were telling everyone it was last call.  Again, weird.  One really great thing:  they have Templeton Rye on their menu.  This is a small rye from Iowa, and I've never seen it here in Vegas.  I didn't order it, but it is nice to know where I can get it!",

The staff running this joint seems like they just stepped out of high school. Gossiping at the register, cliques at the hotess stand. Getting off work and hanging at the bar in your work clothes...  Upon entering the lounge, it smelled like a bathroom. I could've left at that point, but we decided to stay & give it a chance.   We were sipping our drinks inside at the bar, and the music started playing \"N'Sync\"...then a song by \"New Kids on The Block\" and I said aloud, \"what's up with the boyband music?\" One woman at the bar said it was from an app on your smartphone where you can control the music. I asked her if the customers are controlling it? Because for a wine & whiskey lounge, it doesn't seem like a fitting dynamic. She semi-explained that you get to pick one song for free then you have to pay for the service. The next song that came on was Brittney spears. We paid quickly and were ready to leave.   The bartender came running out with a big smile and explained that one of their coworkers was controlling the music from home as a joke. It's not funny when it's running business out of your front door.   Here's an idea; don't play child's music at a wine and whiskey lounge. Try that. Then maybe everyone won't be standing around and gossiping because you'll actually have some business.",

Huge variety of whiskey---not sure about other liquor since I only drink whiskey. The food is delicious. Some of the food is quite small with regards to portion size, but it's amazing. Love the appetizer tacos and blazin' sliders. The deep fried olives were nothing special and could have done without.",

They have a large fire pit that will keep you warm on those chilly evenings. The staff is very nice and super knowledgeable on everything. Huge kudos to them!!!",

I am a big fan of this place just because it's cozy and comfortable.  The noise level isn't drastic and annoying.  We can actually talk to the people around us.    The bartender who served us was very knowledgeable with what we should eat and just brought out drinks that she thought we would like based on how we described our personalities.  The food she suggested since we weren't all that hungry was:  ARTISANAL CHEESE SELECTIONS accompanied by seasonal fruits + homemade onion jam + quince paste + gourmet bread BOUCHERON goat milk . ivory colored paste surrounded by a bloomy white rind . creamy gooey middle + claylike toward the rind  5 CHEDDAR two-year aged handcrafted with premium cow milk from small Vermont family farms + creamy mouth feel + unforgettable individuality  5 MOODY BLEU made in small batches from fresh local Wisconsin milk . delicately smoked over fruit wood to create subtle smoky undertones with hints of roasted nuts + coffee . rich + sultry + seductive  5 COMTE AOC fruity + nutty French gruyere . from the Jura Mountains in Switzerland 6 TRUFFLE BRUSCHETTO cow + sheep milk blend for extra flavor + dimension . folded with pieces of black + white truffle . sweet + tender + plenty of earthy truffle flavor 8  CHARCUTERIE SELECTIONS accompanied by mustard + homemade pickles + artisanal bread SPANISH CHORIZO  spicy + dry with touch of smokiness from Spanish smoked pimento 4 SALAMI TOSCANO  black pepper + touch of salt + fresh garlic + fennel 4 PROSCIUTTO  cured on the bone + aged over nine months . sliced paper thin 5 SMOKED DUCK  enjoy the layer of crudo + fat + skin on this naturally smoked Magret 5 SPICY SOPPRESSATA  rich flavors of garlic + peppercorn + paprika + fennel + red wine 6   This was awesome and definitely worth having.  Most of our drinks were beer and wine.  However, there were a few shots our bartender made us to keep the night going.  I just don't remember what they were.  I just remember how much fun we had here that night, thanks to the company we had, the bartender and the food and drinks.",

They were made with Angus beef , bacon, avocado relish, and chipotle aloi. When they came out they looked unreal. Some places serve you sliders all smooshed and sloppy but the tops of the buns were fully rounded.  They tasted really good too! We also ordered the Pearfect Salad ($9.00). It had spinach leaves, grilled Asian pears, bufala mozzarella, candied walnuts, rocket arugula and spritzed with champagne vanilla vinaigrette. The pears were good sized and four of them came with the salad. It was delicious and big enough to share.   I love the food here but the drinks are overly too strong for me. Mu husband ordered a grown up shake but I could only take a sip from it.",

    "text": "We went to Double Helix the 1st time back in Dec 2013 as a stop on our \"progressive \" dinner. Yes I know normally people go house to house but in Vegas (and NYC) we go bar to restaurant to bar.  It was a great choice for the 1st stop. We had a round of cocktails. then ordered the Chef's Selection of Charcuterie & cheese plus 2 orders of sliders along with a carafe of Sangria. More than enough for 6 people.   Or so we thought.   The Chef's selection was perfect for a little nosh - but we are BIG folks & so we ordered a second one of the top 3 choices from both cheese & meats.   The smoked duck & the chorizo were the star attractions from the meat side while the Moody Bleu & the truffle bruschetto were the big cheese.   I want the homemade onion jam on everything.   The \"boys\" of the group wanted cigars - so while they were having around of maker's mark cigars, we ordered another carafe of the sangria. I'm a sangria purest. fruit, juice & wine. But why stick to boring fruit when you can have blackberry brandy, orange vodka & apple schnapps coupled with a very full bodied red wine.  Luckily there was some nice crusty bread to soak up all the liquor.   But if you follow my yelp, you'll know i'm in this for the 'fatability\"  So yes they have nice hip friendly seating. without having to ask for it.   Food: tasty & fresh Ambiance:  pleasant but a bit loud with the tv's going.  Service: attentive but not overly so.   total bill was $176.00 including tip & cigars. Appx 60.00 per couple. Not bad.   Would we go again? Yes! Tonight as a matter of fact. What better spot to celebrate National Crap Spackle day?",

    "text": "We popped in here for Girls' Night on a Friday night because we heard about $5.00 wine tasting and various food specials. Yay! A new place, new tastes, and deals to boot. How can you go wrong?  Let's start with that part, shall we?  The service was mediocre at first, and that's being a bit generous. It was about 15 minutes before HH/tasting specials were to start and the place was not busy by any stretch. Three or four servers and two bartenders seems like plenty of staff to get this party started with some recommendations and indivualized attention and service.  Um... *flags someone down, gets acknowledged, waits a bit longer*  Let's try that again. \"wave/flag/air horn*  Hmmm...  \"Oh! Hi, didn't see you (after making eye contact a few times).\"   *sigh*  Once we began ordering it wasn't that bad. It's still a cumulative experience, however, and it was a tad slow throughout the night.  The other WTF moment came when the specials were explained. Two specific dishes and only the house wine were offered as specials. The server even admitted that the tasting was almost always the house wine. So it's not a tasting, but a special on house wine. Got it.  We ordered a couple glasses of wine to taste something new (and help us decide on a bottle) and then ordered a bottle of the collective favorite. The wine selection isn't bad. I found some new things to consider and some solid restaurant favorites. Still, for a place that is part wine bar, I have seen better lists in lesser places. Just a thought.   We also decided on food and ordered the steak (one of the specials) and a charcuterie plate.  *This* is where it all picks up. The steak was generously portioned for a tapas/appetizer selection, had a fantastic flavor, and was perfectly tender. The charcuterie plate was fantastic. I wish there were more (quantity of each versus quantity of choice - there were lots of different flavors already represented) cheese to go with the copious amounts of meat. That is my only hangup, however, as everything was paired creatively and the small additions (gelees, fruits, nuts, etc.) were unquestionably complementary... and seasonal to boot, always a plus!  We also shared a death-by-chocolate sampler that, aside from being a diabetic coma on a beautiful plate, was done well. Various takes on sweetness, richness, and textures made it all work together and offered something for every type of sweet tooth.  Service improved a bit, as I said, as the night went on... but it was still a little too inattentive (including forgotten water, twice).  Parts of the evening were 4-4.5 stars, some were 2. Overall, a solid 3-star (maybe even 3.5), A-OK kind of place that, even if just for the charcuterie, is most likely worth a return visit.",

They offer specials during their brunch on Saturday & Sunday from 11 AM - 3 PM.  The arancini were so good we ordered them again!  LIttle balls of risotto, marscapone, and mushrooms served with a white truffle aioli...mmmmm....  We also tried the bbq pork sliders, very good as well, American fries, and the heirloom tomato salad.  The salad was another hit!  Fresh burrata, arugala pesto and a sweet, rich balsamic.  Very refreshing.  The fries were a really nice surprise!  They are served in a cone and seasoned with shallots and herbs, and then served with two sauces:  a sherry aioli & a spice ketchup.  Yowza!  And the drinks, you might ask?  That's why I've been wanting to try this place.  I started with a pear winetini, a refreshing, slightly sweet (not cloying sweet) mix of prosecco, pear vodka, and st. germaine.  I also tried a flight of red wines from Italy - very nice assortment.  They have Happy Hour specials as well, so I'm thinking there's more arancini & wine in my future.",

I never order off the menu when he works, I just tell him what kind of drink I want and he comes up with something for me. The only food I've ever had here was the meat and cheese plate, which was excellent. This is a great place to have a couple of drinks with friends and the location is excellent since it's on Town Square.",

    "text": "Quality off the Strip wine bar at off the Strip prices.  WIN!  Straight to the libations.  There is a short list of outstanding, highly rated, old world and cult wines offered by the bottle at dirt cheap prices (ie the impossible to get '09 Mollydooker Velvet Glove $225.  It's so hard to get that a wine shop in Hawaii only let me touch and caress the bottle but not buy)  There is also a good selection of wines by the glass offered both in full and half pours to help with tasting.  Unfortunately whiskey, scotch and bourbon drinkers are left out.  For a place named Wine and WHISKEY, you expect more than just the most common names behind the bar  The simple food is wine centric.  It all pairs well.  Props to the \"Grown-ups grilled cheese\" with its gooey, melted gruyere and smoked ham core; olive poppers (goat cheese and chorizo studded olives); and the rich mushroom arancini with a white truffle scented aioli.  The cheese and charcuterie selection is very good (thanks to a misunderstanding, I tried them all.  No one thought it was funny to serve a dish for 5-7 to ONE me huh?)  They do offer salads, sandwiches and pastas for those wanting something heavier.  Don't be surprised to find the same items at their other location, Bottles and Burgers.  Great happy hour from 3:30-7:30  Recommended",

Bartender said they would remake the burgers, which we said was fine as we were not in a rush.  Five minutes later, what are clearly the same burgers reappear with most of cheddar scraped off,   Same French fries, now cold - mentioned to our server who wasn't particularly interested but did get us fresh fries.  The burgers (one medium and one md rare) were delicious, the new French fries were also amazing.  Really though? A $20 hamburger and the kitchen makes it wrong and scrapes off the cheese?  Wouldn't you at least comp the food when we are drinking wine at $150?  Our server did say he would discount the wine, not sure if that actually happened or not...",

We had people trickle in and out which I know can be a nuisance but there were very nice about it. Lisa was our server and took excellent care of us! We had the \"grown up grilled cheese\" which was excellent. They're plate sizes are similar to tapas. Very small portions but cuts up so everybody can have a tiny piece. Overall great experience!!",

Vicki the waitress asked me why (I DIDN'T LEAVE HER A TIP ON MY CARD)  I stopped by with a group of colleagues  for some drinks after a long day at work, and everything was going great until we were all about to leave.  That's when Vicki the waitress comes over looks at me and loudly says in front of everyone \"Are you ok? I just wanted to make sure my service was good enough for you, because YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ME A TIP\" I was baffled that she had said that I didn't know what to say, how dare she ask me why I didn't leave her a tip on my debit card? I told her \"yes, I am ok you are ok\" she then walked away and hid away at one end of the restaurant.  This upset our group as not one of us could believe she had just said that, how embarrassing and rude of her.  One of my coworkers gets up and speaks to Kyle one of the bar tenders and begins to explain to him what had just occurred.  And from the other end of the restaurant Vicki screams to us \"THAT'S HOW I PAY MY BILLS\" once again we were baffled with the way she was acting.  I stepped over to Kyle and explained how regardless of Vicki's day she had no right to treat me or anyone  in such a rude outrageous way.   I had planned on leaving her a cash tip, that of which she never received, nor deserved.  I can't even begin to explain how upset I was, this sort of behavior is TERMS FOR TERMINATION.  Kyle passed us his business card and apologized and we left, Vicki was nowhere to be seen.   I will never return here, which is upsetting because I love town square's, atmosphere.  Vicki was not attentive to our table at all, and provided terrible customer service from the very beginning, so she had never genuinely deserved a tip.  It's so unfortunate that we had this experience, i hope no one ever has to experience anything like this.",

Great selections of wines, and great food!  We ordered different cheeses and meats, and got a great recommendation from the server on the best cheeses and meats too.  Their grown up grilled cheese, and meatballs were also both yummy!  It's smaller than other bars in town square, but it's perfect.

They have two sitting options, outside or inside.  Happy hour is everyday 3:30 pm to 7:30pm with half priced select wines, whiskey and food. They have an amazing cigar selection with 12 different cigars.  They have a ton of different food options that range from tacos, cheeseburgers, meatballs, tuna, grilled cheese and more. They have a ton of wine, and whiskey options as well as mixed drinks and beer. I love how they offer local Vegas beers as well as bottled and domestic.

This gives you the oppurtunity to taste for a fraction of the price $$ and we all love that. The selection of whiskey is one of the best I've found and If you are a wine lover the selection is just as amazing.  If you are looking for a bite to eat they offer something for everyone.",

I had to bug a few while they were sitting at a table rolling silverware and they were so nice and sweet and didn't treat me like a bother at all.   The drinks are on point and delicious. The bartenders are very knowledgeable about all their inventory and different drinks. One of them happened to be walking by when I asked a friend a question about why they would have something as an ingredient and they stopped and explained why and we had a great discussion about It.  The only minus is the decor. It is a bit dated, or maybe it's just me. I don't care for red and black. Also the music was ai little different. Not exactly what I would expect to find at a 'wine and whiskey bar. Air supply was playing when we walked in and while there we heard Smashing Pumpkins, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Dave Matthews Band, Journey, and The Postal Service.   I love it but it's not exactly what I expected.  Overall we had a fantastic time and I will definitely be back",

If you're interested in the $5-6 glasses of wine, many of them are already that price every day so don't feel like you're missing out and have to come during happy hour. There's TV screens so you can watch sports as well as a cigar shelf if you'd like to smoke.   I ordered the arancini (fine) while my coworker ordered the chapters salad (overloaded with shallots). I know it's a Tapas-type bar but I wish there was a portion of the menu with bigger entree-like items",

I have been here a handful of times and each time had great service and an enjoyable experience. We always get there right when they open to take advantage of their great happy hour. I have made a charcuterie board where you can pick 3 cheeses and 3 meats from their lists. It also comes with bread and other various accoutrements including pickled veggies, mustard, jam, and fruit. We asked for extra bread at no charge when we needed more. They have a really great patio with a fire pit or you can opt to sit inside at the bar or a high or low table. I have never been disappointed with the wine selection and will most certainly be back next time I am in town.",

I did not make the reservation (a friend made it for us), but I called on Friday to confirm.  The reservation was confirmed during that call.  When I arrived on Saturday, I was told that they did not have a reservation for us and was told they don't make reservations for Friday and Saturdays.  I was told that \"when some tables leave, we will try to get you a table\".  I promptly texted all the guests that were not there yet and told them not to come (as I was not sure those of us there would get a table).  It made me feel like a jackass.  We waited quite a while and finally got a table; in the meantime, a staff member spilt a drink on me.   They tried to make things right: birthday shot for me and a round of shots for the table.  However, when you planned to have a party of 18-20 for dinner and end up celebrating a milestone birthday with 7, it's a bummer.   The delay also made us late for the next part of the celebration.   It's likely a great place if it's not a special occasion and if your plans are loose.",

It is very nice to have a small nice cigar menu when drinking good whiskey. This isn't allowed in Washington State because our wait staff is mostly ill people who will die prematurely of second hand smoke if they just smell it for one minute of their day, never mind the damn forest fires we smell for months at a time during the summers, anyway, sorry I got carried away......The menus items we requested were presented professionally very tasty. I'd tell you what we had but then you would realize just how much of this place we tried and that maybe overindulgent but ya know it was happy hour for like four hours!  We were very comfortable here and we had two wait staff help us since we moved to the smoking deck, both very professional and friendly.  I only give it a four because the smoking deck was to small.",

I got to sample some first and it was exceptionally smooth with a minimal nose burning alcohol scent common to many whiskeys. I was a fan!   Foodwise, we ordered the chickpea hummus and the BBQ pork sliders.  The hummus was delicious and had a perfect consistency.  The BBQ pork sliders were so good!  The buns were soft but toasted on the inside.  The pork was moist, juicy, and very flavorful.  There was a wonderful apricot sauce and the chipotle slaw had a lovely tame flavor to it as well. All the flavors worked together really well. Both dishes were excellent for bar food.  The bar is sized well and the entire lounge had an adequate amount of tables and bar seats.  They also have a few large tables available to support bigger groups.  They also have outdoor seating available.  Double Helix offers a comfortably warm ambiance.  There are only two single stalls bathrooms though, so I found myself waiting for the restroom a couple times.  They use Rockbot, an app that lets patrons select music in the bar.  They had an awesome playlist that night with Florence, Imagine Dragons, and some of my other favs.  Our server was Kelly and she provided wonderful service.  Our water glasses were always full and we had drink orders in before our drinks were empty.   All in all, great happy hour and great price.  For 3 glasses of whiskey, 1 glass of pinot noir, and the BBQ pork sliders, I paid $32.  Not bad at all.  I'll definitely go back with some girlfriends or go here on date night.",

When my friend suggested we meet at Double Helix because she loved their Happy Hour, I groaned a little but agreed.   When we first walked in the place was dead. Literally no one. We grabbed a table and ordered some Happy Hour drinks and food. The options are pretty good for both. The red sangria is great and you can get it in carafes. Also, the Happy Hour food was surprisingly filling and had some pretty swanky options. Those ahi taco things are killer.  After a while more and more people started showing up and by the time we left it was pretty crowded. Our server was really nice and always on top of refills and additional orders. Initially I thought Double Helix was going to be one of those Happy Hour places where you feel out of place if you dont have your nails painted and your best pearls on, but I was wrong. It turns out it is much more relaxed and enjoyable than it may look at first. The lighting is low and the vibe is just laid back.",

    "text": "On a random night off, a friend of mine and I decided to head over to Town Square for a movie. Our plan was to hit up a Happy Hour scenario after the flick, and Double Helix wine bar fit the bill. I hadn't been in for over a year since it opened, and back when they were starting out it was kind of quiet. I was happy to see that business had picked up.   The bartender was really great, the happy hour specials were cool and the style of the place is nice. It's a bit mis-matchy in design, but that's for another review :) in any event I'm sure I'll be back down for a cocktail or two as they have a descent bourbon collection and I'm a fan of that. The food was just ok in my opinion, but that's relative I suppose. Basic and good for drinking, flat-breads and items of the sort. Check it out if you get a chance. Happy Eating!",

    "text": "Decent small plates restaurant in Town Square. Their menu has a few similar items as their sister restaurant Bottles & Burgers (minus the burgers). The arancini ($9,  risotto fritters with mascarpone, roasted mushroom, white truffle aioli) is just as good as the ones at Bottles & Burgers. It's also one of the best items to get at Double Helix.  The olive poppers ($6, crispy olives stuffed with chorizo and honey goat cheese) are good and not too salty. You get seven per order. The BBQ pork sliders ($9) have a slight amount of heat and are topped with a sweet apricot sauce and slaw with a marginal amount of mayo. The churrasco Argentino ($15, angus American skirt steak, chimichurri sauce) was tough  and chewy. Their \"Perfect Salad\" ($9, grilled Asian pears, bufala mozzarella, candied walnuts, rocket arugula,champagne vanilla vinaigrette) was anything but perfect. The best thing about it was the candied pecans. The fries ($6) weren't as good as the ones at Bottles & Burgers.  The atmosphere is relaxed and loungey, which is a nice change of pace from other spots at Town Square. There is a kid's menu. Our kid was with us and he got the chicken tenders ($5)... actually, that should be singular because it was only one chicken tender with a bunch of fries.",

    "text": "Double Helix, Town Square  - An elegant, comfortable, cozy place for happy hour (3:30-7:30, DAILY), either at its classy bar or in the attractive patio by the courtyard. It has an EXTENSIVE menu for drinks ($3-7 for beer, wine; 1/2 price cocktails, whiskey) and bar dishes ($3-6)!  - See menu on this link: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lvhhtime.com%2Fdouble-helix-wine-and-whiskey-lounge-happy-hour.html&s=28f87c6f11dd4fbe227859e20a52513d87045f7ba94d408825f61328c34df0ce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lvhhtime.com/double-heli...</a>   DETAILS: - There are several nice places in Town Square that I like to relax in over happy hour, and Double-Helix is among the top on my list, for its quiet ambience, great selection of drinks and bar food at very reasonable prices, as well as excellent, friendly service! It's the place of choice, when I prefer a quieter ambience; and/or when I'd like to try its whiskey special, also. Yes, they have flights of 4 different whisky combos on the menu.  - Its horseshoe-shaped bar counter is small,  but comfortable and inviting. Its beautiful display shelves showcase a great variety of whiskeys! From the bar, one can see the cozy, nicely furnished patio by the busy courtyard. The tiny dining area around the bar counter has an intimate ambience. Other than the courtyard, there is no view, however.  MY HAPPY HOUR EXPERIENCE: - I enjoyed my happy hour here a couple of weeks ago. I had Stuffed Olives ($3); Arancini ($6), a Stella ($3.5); a glass of Sauvignon Blanc ($4). The olive dish came with six stuffed olives, which looked cute and were bursting with flavor! Arancini tasted a bit bland, but ok with djon muster dip.    - A couple of gentlemen at the bar had a flight of 4 whiskey brands. I forgot the name of the flight, but remembered they said 3 of the four were absolutely superb! According to them our bartender, Jessica is an expert on whiskey. She was very friendly, efficient, and attentive to all customers. All serving staff was friendly, and helping each other out - good training and practice.  - Wish it'd have reverse happy hour, too, for the after movie crowd!  Peterskis, Nov 2012 --",

We started the night with appetizers and wine in the restaurant part of the bar.  Our waitress was extremely friendly, polite, and knew what to recommend based on our tastes.  She even recommended the wines for us perfectly.  As we sat there talking, one of my friends had a question.  He waved down someone he thought was working there, and we come to find out that the person we waved down was the GM of the store.  It was nice to see the GM working just as hard as his employees.  We ended up having a nice conversation about the types of cigars, and he even helped make recommendations on what we should get for cigars.  Overall, our experience at the store was amazing.  The employees were helpful, the GM was amazing, and the food and cigars were perfect.",

Always seems like the same staff and two friendly bartenders which speaks volumes about the quality management.  Not only do they make amazing drinks but they're very knowledgeable about every bottle on the shelf.  My only complaint is that it is a little pricier than other bars e.g. McCallan 12 is about $18 when it's $12 next door.  The environment and welcoming staff make it worthwhile.  Take advantage of the whiskey of the month...  It's typically something unique for a great price.   **Update**I stand corrected...  It's $15 for the Mac 12 and apparently they pour 2 oz versus 1.5 so its actually cheaper.",

I had their pork carnitas tacos and still wondering where the habanero or the Helix sauce they shared in the description were incorporated.   Also, it seems they have one tiny fan for the entire bar so be prepared to be hot. I won't be heading back there any time during the summer, maybe in the winter and if I'm in the area. Definitely not a place I'd go out of my way for.  Last thing, they wouldn't do separate checks for our table, granted there were only 7 of us -  including two couples ",

    "text": "\"It is being here now that is important,\" George Harrison. He also said:\"there's no past nor any future!\" One can take this way of thinking anyway you like, but too many of us linger in a small realm and cannot get out.   Break free of the realms that bind you, my visit is a venture to the  continues celebration of \"the now.\" This was my husbands favorite bar, restaurant, and chill place. We spent so much time here! It's been over a year and I'm ready to \"be here\" again. It is a great honor to be able to explore and find happiness in the things that we enjoyed routinely again.   Moving forward, let's sit at the bar. It's warm and cozy on this bar stool that just hugs me. Marcus is my guide for the evening. Believe it with the weirdest weather happening around the globe. Is it not? It's snowing here. The snow was a sleet base; yes I said snow. The bar is the place to be; it's truly very comfortable and mellow in here. The bartender that continues to make my drinks should be referred to as the marvelous Marcus. I enjoyed his company all afternoon, into the evening. While watching him make drinks, his skills are that of a True master bartender.  As I sit here I relive ghosts of the past. A time when we would sit on the couch that's out on the patio. All gathered around the fire pit with a drink in one hand and cigar in the other. These are great haunting memories and images from so long ago. I am so glad that I can enjoy them now, even though my Chris only walks in the shadow. I came in on a Saturday and caught the brunch deal. This deal included either Sangria, Bloody Mary, Peach Champagne, and some other types of beers, unlimited for $20. This is an incredible deal. It's pays for itself after two drinks. I ended of drinking four before the deal ended. The drink deals that Helix has is outstanding. Continuing the celebration let's move on into evening with some Bourbon.  Presentation is Everything! Ordering my Bourbon on the rocks, actually rocked. The ice that the Bourbon was poured over contained a lotus flower. What a beautiful gesture? The lotus flower represents purity and perfection! The bourbon could not of been more perfect. Sticking with Bourbon let's see how good Marcus is at making a Whiskey Sour. Marcus made the Whiskey Sour to ultimate perfection. He even included the egg white. The Sangria that they serve here is only made with all the freshest ingredients and juices. Top shelf liquor is used, with a full bar. The spin on their Sangria includes slices of apple inside shaken and then shaken again: with apple cinnamon along the rim of the glass. My guide Marcus turned this experience into tolerable amazing fun with cinnamon on top!  Wow, this is work! Aside my Marcus, all of the associates that call Helix their home are a family. They move and treat one another with such love. They care for one another such as a family does. The wait staff could not of been more kind when we dined here with the twins either. Did I mention, it's doors are open to all. Although the littles cannot, \"yet\" be in the bar area; their day will come. Drinks are served all day and why not let the chefs here make dinner. Come, bring the children; save some wine. Create new family memories that the family will cherish for life. Let the family of Double Helix provide your family a fun and incredible dining experience.   Margarita pizza with cheese that will not quit. Ridiculously delicious. When they placed the pizza in front of us; first just blown away by the presentation. The pizza is served on a stone plate; thats not only beautiful, but keeps the pizza warm while you enjoy it. Lifting those slices up the cheese just lifts with it. In all its glory and there is so much cheese that it does not even pull away from the bread. The incredible smells coming from that pizza , just needing to taste it! My senses so wet finally I can enjoy; extraordinary. The sauce is perfect with absolutely no after taste. The fresh ingredients that are surrounded by massive amounts of cheese. Come explore your eye opening pizza experience for yourself. Let cheese rule the day, and it pairs well with your choice of wine. Salut!  Break the cycle! Know that happiness and life are a wonderful gift. Paired with fabulous drinks, sexy cocktails, cigars, pizza, and family and friends. Come trust the family of Helix to provide you and yours the very best experience and celebrations. Make new memories and live in the now! Cheers to humankind!",

Service was great.  However, the prices were a bit steep - $10 for two tiny bite-size lobster tacos? They were delicious but not -that- delicious. Cucumber martini was crisp and refreshing though, I'd get that again. I don't drink whiskey so I can't speak on their selections but as a bar overall, it was a pleasant experience.",

Well you found it!  Friendly and accommodating staff were there to greet us when we first walked in and there's a usually a good amount of seating, whether at the bar, a corner table or outside next to the firepit - they have a spot for you!  Double Helix offers a fun atmosphere to enjoy time with a partner or friends while feeling that you're being acknowledged and valued as a guest. A well stocked bar makes finding the perfect drink for you really easy and if you have ticket stubs from the cinema like we did, then DH offers their own-name wines for half off, even outside of Happy Hour! Amazing!  We had some taquitos while we were there and they came out hot and quite fast. As bar snacks go, these were great! Not greasy and full of flavour. Would order these again.  If this isn't for you, don't fret! They have specials everyday, a Happy Hour and a comprehensive menu, not lacking in ideas!  Double Helix is definitely somewhere I'd return to. For the variety of drinks, fun chilled atmosphere, friendly staff and tasty nibbles at good prices, it's a no brainer!",

I didn't even know that whiskey was made in Taiwan! Mind blowing.  Knowledgeable bartenders - whiskey sommeliers, whatever the case may be, they know their stuff and can make excellent recommendations based on your preferences.

The meat is \"Blue Moon Beer Braised Short Ribs\". It was tender and juicy, perfectly cooked medium rare. It was served with pico and a poblano sauce that was delicious and tasted homemade.  I also had the Spicy Vegan Hummus. It was served with warm pita wedges, toasted lavash and an eggplant topping. Overall a very good dish.  They feature a decent cigar selection. The cigars are kind of pricey, but you can bring your own.   I enjoyed the experience a lot and will definitely return!",

I love the vibe here and the warm feeling the place has. The mad men is probably my favorite drink I've had so far. I have never gorged on food here simply snacks such as meatballs but all were tasty. Wouldn't think of this place for a main meal but definitely great for light fare and some yummy craft cocktails. The staff is always super nice which always adds a star for me. :)",

I want to come here for drinks more because it is a really nice environment and the bartender is great.  He listens and is very helpful in deciding what to drink since they have a very extensive drink menu, which is always a good thing.  The problem though again is the price.  I get that the whiskeys are unique but I think they are easily overcharging.    That being said, I still come here, albeit less than I would like to.  I guess this makes it my guilty pleasure spot.  It's not something I necessarily need or can afford on a regular basis but yet I come here because the way I feel when inside.  I feel welcomed and not as nervous as I would say, in another bar if I happened to be drinking alone.",

And you can get bloody Mary's too! They have a nice comfy patio which I super cool but they do allow smoking as this is a cigar bar so if you have a small child sit inside because smokers will be out there (had this issue before).

The server was so attentive and extremely kind.  The drinks were amazing.  I had sangria, my spouse had an apple fizz (jack daniels apple and champagne I believe).  We had happy hour apps (bang bang which is a fried jalepeno stuffed w/ lobster and covered in a cream sauce) and fried risotto balls with a creamy cheese sauce (arancino).  They were both to die for, and super cheap, along w/ the drink specials, going on during happy hour.  Seems like a really solid establishment.  We will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "If you are looking for a place to grab a quick drink, I don't suggest coming here. My girlfriends and I came just after happy hour and had to wait for a table, not because they were all sat, but because they were understaffed. In a situation like this, it's not the fault of the guest; perhaps a manager should step in and help run drinks or whatnot?   Due to the fact that they were understaffed, service was slow. When I am sitting with an empty glass of wine I shouldn't have to \"beg\" you to take my money. It kind of ruined the vibe of our night...do you stay and have another drink because the company is great or go find another bar? We  ultimately decided to have a second glass of wine.  The food was great and came out fast. We ordered the ever-so-popular Arancini and a cheese/charcuterie platter. The smoked duck was delicious and the cheese selection was nice. I would maybe suggest combining the cheese/charcuterie on one plate, or serving the cheese on a smaller plate as it not only made the dish appear smaller, but there was barely enough room for 3 of us to eat at our hightop. We each had a small share plate, glass of wine and glass of water...nothing too crazy.   When it came time to pay the bill the server, along with most of the guests, disappeared. Had it still been packed I would have been a little more understanding. It's almost common sense that after you drop off a check you should check back within a few minutes...  UPDATE: Tried this place again on a Thursday evening and took 10 minutes to be acknowledged/same slow service. They do have great happy hour deals so it's hard to resist coming every once in a while.",

The food was off the charts.  We started with a few orders of apps and plates to share which were all delicious.  The place combined a southwest feel with some food that we could all relate to home - from mama's meatballs to the flat breads and everything in between.  The ambiance of the place was great - very mellow which was great for us to kick back and grab a meal, we were out there on a bachelor party and the place was great to just chill and enjoy some great food - not to mention the selection of booze is off the charts, which was good for our party and the place was crawling with tail.  Definitely a good experience and I would and will go back - as a tourist it was a great spot that was off the strip, away from the mayhem yet still in a classy good looking establishment that isn't going to pick your pockets.   five stars.",

I asked if they could accommodate 20 to 30 people and seeing how the place was empty I didn't see why not. The hostess asked of we could sit outside which wasn't ideal since it was over 100 degrees and we were all dressed up. But we did anyways since we weren't given other options. At first We received great service and the drinks were great. Then as everyone came trickling in from the wedding our waitress seemed irritable. We ordered a round of drinks for everyone. 45 minutes later no drinks. So my sister (The Bride ) saw our drink order sitting at the bar getting warm so she kindly asked the waitress if she could grab the drinks for everyone. The Waitress then snapped at the Bride telling her \" No you may not, clearly I'm the only waitress here so you can wait.\" needless to say many of our party left after the poor service and lack of their orders. Finally an hour later we got our bottled beers and mimosas. Paid and left. I will never be going back there again. Luckily a bar next to them had no issues taking our party and their business.",

(10 dollars for 3) bacon wrapped dogs with a pastry puff? oh my. get in my mouth! (that's what she said.) but really. those were so good. our waitress hardly checked on us and when we had to flag her down we caught her staring off into space. poor girl must've been bored. it was over 40 dollars for all the goodies and my male friend still left hungry. so ladies if you come here with a guy make sure they understand small plates and sharing. for the prices of the small plates though i think i'd rather opt for firefly. it was okay, but not omg gimmie more! i may come back if i hear about a happy hour.",

In good faith that this was an accident and the girl obviously was horrified and very apologetic, we did not cause a fuss and finished our drinks before leaving. However, when the bill came, nothing was done to compensate the ruined clothing or fact that he had been sitting there sticky and wet the entire time. When this was brought to management's attention, he came over and apologized and said that he had edited our bill to compensate, but when we were redilivered the check, it was HIGHER than when we gave it to him! One of the servers then told us that he didn't really care about things like this anyway. We left disgusted and will not be back. What a terrible way to treat your patrons.

All four of us ending up spending $40 each, including tip. The decor is great and most of the drinks were great. The only complaint on the drinks is that I got the sangria martini and they put brown sugar on the rim of the glass. It is gross combined with the drink and honestly, I don't like brown sugar in the first place. Once I cleared away some brown sugar so I could drink, it was fine. The hummus was amazing and we couldn't get enough of it.. my friends got the sliders, grilled cheese and these cheese ball things. I tried the cheese ball things which were also amazing. They liked their food, as well. It was pretty slow to get anything out to us unless it was the hummus. The waitress also forgot a couple of drink orders so we waited forever for those and then we had to basically force her to take our payments. But the happy hour drinks and food combined with the prices are lovely.. I just wish the service was also because it would seriously be my new favorite place. I'll try again in a bit and see if anything changes!",

    "text": "So, Double Helix has popped up at Town Square after the demise of The Grape.  We recently ended up here for a night cap after a night out.  Pros: the decor is nice and upscale.  They also have a decent selection of whiskey and scotch, and offer various cocktails made with whiskey and scotch.  There's also a nice outside patio area with fire pits, or something to that effect.  While some crazy bastards were sitting out there at night, it's just a mite too chilly for me at 40-45 degrees right now.  I imagine, however, that it will be pleasant to hang out at in the spring/beginning of summer.    Cons: it's expensive!  I can understand more expensive pricing for drinks containing premium whiskey or scotch.  But I ordered Irish coffee and it was $10.  Ten dollars for small cup of coffee with Bailey's in it? Give me a break!  There wasn't even a dollop of cream or anything fancy in it.  Adding insult to injury, once the bill came, I signed the receipt and placed it in the wallet in front of me on the table.  It's something I typically (and absentmindedly) do while my party and I wrap up and get ready to leave.  Well, our particular waitress came over, and without saying one peep, reached over me and my coffee, and grabbed the wallet.  (We were sitting at a bistro table and thus, were higher off the ground.)    I've NEVER, EVER have had anyone do that to me before at a restaurant or bar -- big, small, fancy or shady.  Who does that???  I understand that it was late, and they may have needed to close the register.  But, it would have been proper to ask first before physically reaching over me.  Nope, not here.  Not even an \"excuse me\" or anything.  Nor were we the only or last people inside; in fact, there was still a good amount of patrons inside and out.    I'm not a snob about service, nor do I have wildly unrealistic expectations.  I understand that people working in the service industry get busy, may be tired, have bad days, etc.  But this was simply discourteous and poor form.  Not cool, chick.         I like the place itself and *may* give it another try.  But sadly, it was disappointing the first go around.",

    "text": "I went here the first time I went to town square and made sure to make it here for happy hour.  They had a lot of good deals, cheap whiskey, half price select appetizers, half price wine and cocktails on select items.  It was a good deal.  The food we got was good, we had the arrancini, the grown up grilled cheese, the steak with chimichurri sauce and a chopped salad.  The food was all pretty good.  I know my standards are high so I will give it a solid 4 stars.  The cocktails were good.  The only criticism is of the term \"wine and whiskey lounge.\"  I'm not being mean but their wine menu was bad for a place that considers itself a \"wine lounge\" and their whiskey menu was boring for a place that considers itself a \"whiskey lounge.\"  Don't go here expecting to be able to try some great wines or some artisinal whiskey.    If you are going to a movie and want a place to get a cocktail and a snack before, this is a great place.  Try the arrancini. :)",

We sat outdoors and the seating was very comfortable and the fire pit was a definite plus. This is a fun place to meet for happy hour,  great for people watching at Town Square. We ordered a few items from the happy hour menu,  and they were very tastey but fairly small. Next time I will eat a little more before hand so I can enjoy all the sangria I want with one well paired appetizer.",

If you are ever hanging out in town square this lounge is a nice place to kick back and unwind to some great tasting food paired with the best Chardonnays or wines. Helix has a full bar and there are big couches to relax & dine on too. Very chill. And the reason why I'm reviewing is because it's so far the best tapas I've tried yet. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Took my family from out of town here to try the whiskey flights.  In the end the manager tried to rip us off and our waitress, Brittany, was rude.  The prices were outrageous and the staff was not accommodating.  I was ashamed of bringing my family there.  I will not be recommending this place to any of my friends and family.  The manager, Michael, tried to sell us a 1 ounce shot of Jack Daniels Sinatra for $25.  The 2 ounce shot they sell is priced at $40.  The manager made up his own price of $25 for the 1 ounce shot which should have been no more than $20.  We were getting ready to spend over $200 but when the manager tried to over charge us $5 we made our way out.  When I confronted him about it he acted like he didn't care, was rude, and decided to change his mind  to $20 instead of $25.  I told him it was too late because my family was already upset and walking out the door.  He didn't even try to apologize and sarcastically told me to have a nice day.  These guys make over $500 off a $165 bottle (25 ounces) and you're telling me there was no way he could be generous or hospital to us for a 1ounce pour of fire water!?!?  We didn't want a discount, we just didn't want to get ripped off and pay more for less!   We had just finished dining at Ri Ra Irish Pub inside Mandalay Bay shops, and got a flight of single malt scotch for $18 and amazing service.  We even tried more whiskey after the manager came over and engaged in conversation with us and pointed out some single malts he wanted us to taste!  So we were stunned when Michael at Double Helix tried to rip us off right away.   If you want reasonably priced whiskey and hospitable service stay away from this place.  Worst experience I have EVER had in Las Vegas by far.  I have been living here for 8 years and used to work in the Food/Beverage Industry as a bartender/manager.  This is their mission statement online too: Double Helix strives to achieve and maintain such distinction in food and wine service and knowledge, delivered professionally in welcoming atmosphere, that the restaurant gains a first class reputation for unique gastronomy, gracious hospitality, comfort and beauty which draws new and repeat customers year after year.",

    "text": "I've been to both the Palazzo and Townsquare location, and I can say that I both like them equally.  The interior decoration for this location is very dark, but light and chill.  I like how the set up is made, and the mood of the music can be quite interesting if you come on a good day.  Sometimes it would be indie, other times it would be house. Regardless of that I did wish that the music was a little lower than it should be, I don't think we're at a night club guys.    Well onto other important factors, the people at the bar a nice.  Sometimes you might even have intriguing conversations with them.  I'd like to add that there is happy hour, but only on selected items and it varies on certain days.  The food here has been the number one attention grabber for me so far, I've tried almost everything on the menu and I can say I'm quite impressed for a bar that's well known for their wine.  For those who complain about the prices of the drinks, they're not selling the cheap stuff. You can't get a glass of merlot and expect it to be $2.00, you're not paying for a glass full of crap.  So excuse my language, but this isn't your typical bar where you just order cocktails and shots.  They do serve wine and the expensive stuff by the glass, hence the name \"WINE and WHISKEY.\"  The food's served as tapas, somewhat like a Firefly experience.  What I did get to try were the: - Aracini: It was delicious and oozing hot fresh when I first bit into it.  The taste of the truffle oil was dominant, and I loved it.  - BBQ Pork sliders - I love the taste of coleslaw in any burger, and I was happy to have it incorporated.    - Quesidilla - MMmmmMM, what a well incorporated dish. Everything just oozed together, I was merely impressed. And the addition of guacamole just made my day.  - Heriloom Burrata - all I know that the prosciutto and cheese with basil leaf anything, is always good.   - Chipotle Slider - Guacamole in any slider with bacon in my book, is worth trying.    - French Fries - Ahh the crispiness of their fries, and the two sauces on the side.  I love fries, so you can never go wrong with that.      Aside from the food, I hope they do continue to improve with their kinks and do well because there food is amazingly delicious. That with a glass of Moscato, and I'm good. Tipsy even. ^_^",

I'm not asking for experienced Somms but you know an inexperienced one when you see one.  I wouldn't suggest die hard wine lovers come to this place...I think it's for a more relaxed sipper.  The hostess/sommelier/waitress/eye candy girl was very nice.  I think the rule is though, you don't pour your own wine, but the guys I was with were really left with no choice.  She didn't come back for a while.  It wasn't a busy night...maybe she could tell we were bored..  The goods:  Their water was fantastic!  Seriously that's all I ordered.  My friends seemed to enjoy the bottle of Riesling they ordered (shame I didn't share it with them, Riesling is my favorite), and I had a sip of some Desert Blood thing.  Not too bad.  The atmosphere:  I was really confused.  I expected a modern almost futuristic design but it seemed like it was a cross between a hookah lounge complete with Indian lanterns and a pub, squishy leather loveseats included.  I definitely want to give it another shot, maybe pull everything I can out of the experience.  But until then, I'm afraid this is all I've got.",

I was, as usual, running late so by the time I arrive it was the last few minutes of happy hour (which is from 3:30-7:30pm) and the other ladies already had drinks and placed a food order.   I didn't like that the happy hour specials were not more clearly indicated. The waitress rattled off what my options were and waited for me to select. When I go to a new place for the first time, I like to check out all my options before deciding on something but I suppose that's what I get for being late.    I ended up getting a Stella since it was the happy hour beer. I know, ordering a beer at a wine bar? Not really my style but the wines that were on special didn't appeal to me. I was disappointed when the waitress brought back a bottle of Stella and said the tap had just run out. Bottled beer is not the same as beer from the tap, but at least it was half price.  I didn't bother ordering food because again, the items that were half price simply did not appeal to me and the items that did appeal to me seemed pricey. Service was ok, our waitress seemed a bit spacey when it came time to split our bill but it could have been a lot worse.   Will I be back? That I am really not sure of, Town Square has places I have enjoyed drinking at more then Double Helix. .. Maybe if I am already there and craving a glass of Merlot....",

Got the vegan tacos, hummus plate, and fries.   Vegan tacos - lettuce wrap style with couscous, baked chic peas, and slice of avocado. Very tasteless. Almost broke a tooth on the chic peas. They were way way too hard for consumption. I ended up pawning mine off on a hungry co-worker. I don't need the dental bill the next day. I imagine these are better on another day!  Our waitress was a little slow last night. She was super nice and friendly, but the place was packed. I don't want to blame her for this, I'm chalking it up to the management staff to put more boots on the ground. I think I only saw about two girls taking orders, the rest were food runners.  Possibly will update this in the future. I do love this place. It's where I met my better half, so it holds a special place in my heart.",

Based on the reviews of the staff (mostly) and the food I decided to try it.    I wish the before mentioned staff would have been on duty while I was there.    Since I am not from the area I needed to rely on the staff for wine selection.  My waitress's only suggestion for wine was the MOST expensive at $21 for 5 ounces.   $350 per bottle.  It was good,  but still...  It seemed that she didn't really know the wine. Or care.  The arancini was as reviewed.   Worth going back for.  The patio was comfortable back yard patio furniture.   It was difficult to catch my waitress to pay as I had a show ticket.   Otherwise,  she and the other staff provided decent service.",

If I were ever to commit a crime you'll find me taking their wine glasses and light fixtures. They're beautiful, don't judge me.  Any place that carries the Mollydooker Shiraz gets my vote every day. I've managed to drool over my friends choices of food and have yet to have a bad meal here.  I've personally tried the lobster rolls with are presented on a garlic puff pastry which is simply amazing. Their meatballs are deliciously prepared and come with garlic knots that I'm willing to turn a blind eye to the carbs that I'm ingesting.  I am jealous of my friend's salmon sliders. I'm kicking myself for not ordering them because they're nice portion of salmon fillet with a tapenade aioli. I've finally eaten them and they are as tasty as they are to look at.  On a final note, I want their wine glasses. They are a nice size, delicate and beautiful.",

Food was surprisingly good (had charcuterie and skirt steak) I had originally come to the barbecue place around the corner, but it was weirdly empty, and the Yard House just seemed a little too chain restaurant for me. I think I made the right decision - this seems like the best in the area.",

It really just gave me the feeling of being at home on your patio/backyard and just hanging out with your friends while having a drink and a smoke. No rushed feelings of eating at a restaurant, just really nice and comfortable. The service was really good, very helpful, and the food was also good. I enjoyed my wines, I ordered a muscat and port; I love a place that gives the option of these two types of wines, even though I drink other types but these are really sweet and sometimes I'm just craving sweet. They had a pretty good wine selection, some nice California wineries(Napa, Paso Robles etc), some very familiar ones. As for the smoking, the cigars, I could really tell you nothing about it cause I'm not a smoker but I did see on the menu lots of different varieties, I'm sure you smokers will find some you really like. Anyway this is a place I have to come back to when in Vegas, trust me you'll love it too!",

There are wonderful wine selections including wine flights and unique things on the happy hour menu, not just what ever they need to get rid of.   The owner / manager, has a great pallet and the pairings are fantastic! We ordered mostly munchies, but they were all good! The bartender, Kyle, makes a MEAN Manhattan! Their whiskey selection is extensive and among the best I've seen in one restaurant. There are also whisky flights available so you can try a few different ones.   They have an outdoor patio and smoking area so that you can partake in the cigar selection they have inside. While it isn't the most expansive selection I've come across, it is descent and was perfect for a casual evening out on the patio.   The atmosphere inside and out is perfect! Outside chairs are comfortable, the fires are nice in the winter. The patio lights are well distributed and provide for that perfect ambiance. Inside the lights are dim and the decor is chic and trendy, but casual and inviting.   Above all, the service was outstanding! We've been back twice now and had the same experience. This is one of my FAVORITE places in Vegas. It isn't showy, it just has substance!",

We had the aracini, lobster tacos, seared yellowfin, prosciutto, smoked duck (twice), crime brulee cheesecake, and triple chocolate mousse. They were all very delicious, however the prosciutto was definitely on the overly salty side; wished there was at least some fruit or mild cheese to balance it out.

A friend and I were able to go to Happy Hour (3:30 - 7:30) and tried a few tapas- From the HH: Arancini: The best dish we got. Crispy and delicious risotto inside with a savory truffle aioli to dip them in. I could've ordered ten of these plates.  Olive poppers: Not a fan of olives, and these were just alright. Salty & tasted like a tortino's pizza roll. Would skip next time. BBQ Sliders: Meat was well seasoned, but with the slaw, tasted oddly burnt.. wasn't horrible. We also ordered the Whisky Mule and Southern Sipping (more on the sweet side, but less fruity than we had hoped).  Not from the HH, we had the Grown up Grilled Cheese which was good. Soft and cheesy on the inside and out. Prosciutto plate was overly salty as well.. the meat is salty to begin with but with the sauce added, was too much.  Service was nice and food came out quickly, so I can't complain. Would return for the drinks and arancini, but not the other menu items I tried.",

We waited.  By then there were 3 bartenders there and not once we're we greeted , not once did they say we will be right with you, they didn't even look at us. We got up and left.  It's a shame as we were ready for a good night out.  We didn't come for just a drink, we were ready to spend some time and money there.  Instead we went to another bar and spent our money there. We won't be going back.",

    "text": "A great spot in Town Square that I visit frequently!   Double Helix is a small but very welcoming bar. There's couch, table, and bar seating available inside. There's also seating outdoors and a rectangular fire pit.  Their happy hour is from 3:30p-7:30p with discounted wine, beer, whiskey and appetizers. I love going on Mondays rather than during happy hour because they have 1/2 off bottles of wine all day. I go and enjoy my favorite Pinot Noir Meoimi for $20! Tuesdays they have 20% off the final bill for all industry locals and Wednesdays it's 1/2 off featured whiskey and wine of the month. I also like going on Wednesdays to broaden my whiskey horizon. Having great daily specials makes Double Helix that much better.   I don't care for their menu items but I do like their custom charcuterie tray which pairs perfectly with wine. It can get a little pricy adding in all the different meats and cheeses you want.   The bartenders and servers are all very friendly. Jess is one of the bartenders and she is absolutely phenomenal! We love going when she's working. She's quick and always engages with us.   Love this place for the wine, whiskey, and fun ambiance.",

Bartender was very patient as my friend sampled the happy hour wines trying to decide on a favorite. I went with the malbec right away and was pretty happy with it.  I tried to be good and ordered the gluten free appetizer, Seared Yellowfin Tuna. It was really good and at happy hour prices, it was a steal. But then I got weak.... And had to order the Grown Up Grilled cheese. It was adorable. I ordered it sans pork (allergy) and it was really good.   My friend ordered the Olive poppers, but I couldn't try them (also had pork) this place is very pork friendly. I don't think she expected them to be breaded & deep fried. She also ordered the Salmon Caesar salad. It was very big & looked delicious! She said she liked it.   I'm definitely coming back to try some other stuff, if I can keep from ordering the Grown Up Grilled Cheese, that is... Try it!",

    "text": "I am shocked and disappointed by how I was treated here. This was my first time here. This will be my last. The General Manager, Michael Pierotti, mocked my friend and I and accused us of lying about our experience - an experience in which we ordered a dessert, paid for it in advance, and did not receive it.   My friend and I were attending an event at the AMC theatre on a Wednesday evening. We were supposed to be at the event by 6:30. We arrived early and decided to grab a quick bite. So at 5:40p, we stopped by Double Helix for the first time and sat on the patio. We ordered 3 tapas to share. Between 5:45 and 6:05, the food came out pretty quickly, about 5 minutes apart. So at 6:10, we figured we had time to order dessert, the beignets. I asked a male server if the dessert would come out quickly since we had to go soon, and he said yes. So we ordered it. 6:10 is also the last time we were able to get any service or easily get a server's attention.  Between 6:10 and 6:35, the next 25 minutes, no one asked if we needed anything. I had to flag the male server and our original female server a couple times to ask about the dessert. My friend paid ahead of time so we could eat and leave quickly. We paid for our meal about 10 min before we were to leave.  Finally, at 6:30 and no dessert in sight, we got up and stood inside waiting for our server to reappear. We told her we had to leave but we would return for the dessert after the event. She confirmed that with the manager and then we left. When the event concluded, we returned to the Double Helix around 9:30. About 6 min later, we received our dessert, brought to us by the GM (I didn't know who he was at the time. He never introduced himself). As he set down the plate, he said, \"Thank you for coming back,\" with a definite attitude.  We were caught off guard by the tone since a.) we had already paid for this so of course we would come back, and b.) we expected more of an apology for the inconvenience.  We ate and again for about 20 min, no one came by to see if we wanted anything else. All we had was water and our already-purchased dessert. We weren't even provided menus. When the server finally came by, I asked if there was anything they could offer because of the inconvenience. Then the GM returned. He asked how our beignets were and we responded that they were good. Then my friend asked, \"Do you know what happened?\" The GM responded to the effect of \"you put in a rush order and then decided to go\" indicating this was our fault. My friend said, \"Well it wasn't a rush order which is why we thought it odd you just thanked us for coming back.\"  Then the GM responded, \"Yes, I was thanking you for enabling my staff to enjoy some free delicious beignets.\" He went on to say that we chose to leave behind the beignets which were ready to go out. In a sarcastic and mocking tone. We were stunned.  I went on to explain to him the situation: a.) that we ordered the dessert with time to spare and were assured twice by the male server that we would receive it quickly, b.) 25 minutes passed and it never arrived, c.) we had no service during that time and had to seek out and flag servers to get updates and info, and d.) we had to go, and since we had already paid, we came back.  He immediately went on the defensive. No apology. He started with an explanation of how busy it was during happy hour. I certainly understand that. That doesn't mean you ignore patrons for the duration of their stay. Happy hour ends at 7:30. It was 6:10 when they stopped providing us with any service until we stood up to leave. Also, the service was still poor at 9:30.  Pierotti also went on to dispute my factual account of how long things took. The GM claimed our order was a rush and it was ready in 3 min and by the time we were leaving it was ready to go out. We ordered it 25 min before we left. So that math doesn't compute. He didn't agree, implying we were lying. He argued that 25 min would be ridiculously long, that the only thing that takes a long time is the brie. I said yes, that is a long time and that's why we had to finally leave to make our event in time. We also paid for it 10 min in advance. So even then, that math doesn't compute. How could the kitchen have only first heard about the order three minutes before we left when we paid for it 10 min prior? If someone dropped the ball and forgot to put the order in, then that is a simple mistake. Which brings us back to the original issue - this was a great inconvenience and all he had to do was offer an apology and ask what he could do to make the situation better. Standard customer service. Instead, he was defensive, rude, condescending, sarcastic, and accusing us, Customers!, of lying to him about our experience.  The food was fine. But I won't return. I have never encountered a GM who would treat anybody this way. He is abusing his power, and it is a shame there is no one overseeing him to hold him accountable.",

    "text": "(YOUR STAFF THREATENED PAYING CUSTOMERS & ATTEMPTED PHYSICAL ALTERCATION)   Last night I my bf I decided to meet here for drinks and some food, we've been here before and really loved it. Everything is great as the evening goes on. At some point, I'm not sure if it was the bar tender or the bar back, but one of them manages to knock over an entire glass of ice water that completely soaks my jeans and jacket. (We are sitting at the bar) they make a fuss with napkins and wipe the counter but water is already spilled whatever.   I'm annoyed but what can you do. My bf on the other hand is really upset at the situation. It's not until 10 min later the 2nd bartender comes with a napkin saying \"hey I heard water was spilled!\" Uhh ok, thanks but you're a little late. My bf is clearly upset kind of just tells the guys \"it's already spilled there's nothing you can do.\" The bartender doesn't say another word. Not a word about \"hey let's get you another drink.\" I understand they don't have to offer us a round of drinks on the house. But they spilled a whole glass of ice water on my & clearly the customer is upset, and yet, in the moment they do or say nothing to repair this whatsoever.   About half an hour goes by and we decide to leave. We get the check and everything is paid for. I offer to leave a cash tip, which my bf takes because he is so upset at the situation at this point. I get that too. But I'm also the person that always leaves 20% even when it's horrible service, I can't help it. SO WE LEAVE.  The bartender then follows us as we're OUT OF THE DOORS ALREADY, and starts asking my BF what the problems is, how he doesn't want him to leave \"UPSET.\" Ok, at this point now I AM THE ONE GETTING MAD. It feels like the bartender is now just antagonizing him KNOWING damn well he was upset, before we left. The only reason he stops him is what, because he didn't get his tip???? WE PAID THE BILL. And you have every opportunity to repair this customer relationship, we sat long enough AFTER the water spilled, that there was ample time for it to dry by the time we left. SO NO, do not now decide to follow is out because you don't want him to be \"upset.\" That's absurd! You could have done something sooner and you chose not to.  My bf is angry at this point he doesn't talk to the guy and instead walks away from the situation.   And to my disbelief, as we walk off towards our car, THE BARBACK has now followed us and is trying to FIGHT MY BF. This guy left his JOB to follow PAYING CUSTOMERS, so that he could threaten and attempt PHYSICAL ALTERCATION! That is absolutely INSANE!!!!!   I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO DOUBLE HELIX.  YOU WORK A CUSTOMER FACING JOB. YOU MAKE MISTAKES AND CUSTOMERS GET UPSET. IF YOU CAN NOT HANDLE THAT, GET A NEW JOB!!!!!!!!",

The jalapeno was undercooked but it didnt really ruin the dish. I moved on to a pesto grilled cheese sandwich. This was actually pretty good as well. The cheese was really the star of the whole sandwich. After the grilled cheese I ordered some Italiano sliders. I ordered them medium rare but they got to the table and they were more on the medium side. I did enjoy them none the less.   I did notice that a few whiskeys they had on their bar were not listed in their menu. I went to the bartender to ask how much they were but he was a bit too interested in talking to some pretty girls sitting at the bar so I just waited till he was done with the short conversation he was having. When I inquired about their whiskey of the month my waitress informed me it was a scotch from northern Scotland. While not wrong I felt like if you are going to work at a whiskey bar you should at the least know the regions of Scotland and what region certain scotches come from especially if its your whiskey of the month. I ended up having some beer that was on special during happy hour as the prices for their whiskey are a bit high for what you get in return compared to almost any bar Ive been to in Las Vegas yet. After the beer I had a couple \"whiskey mules\". These were actually pretty nice. I would definitely order them again.  All in all it was an alright experience. They do have some decent happy hour specials but the prices on their whiskey are just a bit too high for my tastes.",

    "text": "Whiskey and I are not friends but wine and I are.   Mimi X. and I were supposed to have a girl's night out at Yardhouse but because of the UFC fight and St. Patty's Day weekend, the wait times at Yardhouse were atrocious. Mimi X. suggested that we make our way to Double Helix Wine & Whiskey Lounge instead.   What I love about this place is its ambiance and how swanky it is. The restaurant itself is not very big, but there's ample seating and plenty of room at the bar. The lights are dimmed which adds to the relaxing feel of the place. Basically, this place is perfect for a date night or a night out with a couple gal pals.   Mimi X. got a couple glasses of whiskey on the rocks and I ordered a glass of the Monchoff Riesling. I was quite satisfied with my wine. We also ordered two plates to share.  The Olive poppers (deep fried olives stuffed with chorizo and goat cheese) were delicious! I wish there were more on the plate. The saltiness of the olives sort of hid the taste of the chorizo and goat cheese but nonetheless, it was a tasty appetizer! We also ordered the BBQ Pork Sliders. The apricot sauce, sweet pickle and chipotle saw with the pork was the perfect balance between salty and sweet. Two small sliders come in one order. Again, I wish there was more of it!  I hear that Double Helix has an awesome happy hour from 3:30-7:30 everyday. Whaaat? Even on the Weekends? You know I'll be back real soon to take advantage of this!",

We had ordered dessert but it never came instead the server just came with the bill, we didn't feel like waiting another half hour so we just paid and left. The second time we went right when we were seated the server was fast to get us some water asked if we were ready and we said we needed a couple of minutes. A couple of minutes turned into 20 minutes. Then we finally ordered. Their staff needs more training. Service sucks but food is good.",

    "text": "The happy hour from 3:30-7:30 is one of the longest in town. There is no need to rush from work or cut your day short. The weather today was beautiful, so my friend and I wanted to sit outside on the patio. We got there around 5:00 and the whole place was almost empty. No need to fight others for a seat. This was gearing to be prime time happy hour, where was everyone? Walking past Brio and Yard House made it apparent that everyone were there.  Double Helix's HH food selection is not the most impressive, but it good. Between my friend and I, we got the arancini and the grown up grilled cheese. The arancini came as six small balls. Due to their size, they are more crisp. I enjoy mine a bit larger. The truffle sauce on the side was flavorful. The ham and cheese sandwich is awesome. The gruyere cheese is plentiful and oozing everywhere. Although other places offer a better menu, atmosphere is better at DH. The drinks are ok. The Lucky Ray tasted like all juice and went down easy. The use of Riesling as a base alcohol made it smooth. Their DH Muscat is the drink I enjoyed the most. It has the aroma and flavor of Asian pear or pear apple.   Even though it got busy out in the patio later on, it was still very easy to converse. It is not a wild party spot and I enjoy that.",

I think I've tried every item on the happy hour menu, and been to brunch here twice.  Also sampled several of the cheese plates.  It's the best brunch I've ever had in Vegas.  You MUST try the french toast.  It is incredible.  I love the decor and the ambiance here. I've been to this place in every type of attire you can think of...work uniform, dressy dress, yoga pants and a hoodie, jeans and a club shirt...every time they make you feel super comfortable and really take the time to show that they're happy you're there.  So come one, come all...try this place out.  I hope you love it as much as I do.   **Also they have vegan and vegetarian items.  :)",

The interior is very classy and has dim lighting.  Although they weren't all that busy, they still had plenty of TV's showing the game which was an added plus!  The food menu is rather limited since it's primarily a place for drinks.  A few of my friends split a bottle of white wine since it was a 50% off Monday special.  Our waitress was very friendly although we felt she disappeared quite a bit for a not-so-busy night.  Someone in our group asked her for a wine from the state of Washington and she didn't really have an answer and began flipping through the menu.  So overall it was a good expereience, expect a bit of mark-up for the atmosphere but I would not be opposed to coming back here again!",

I wouldn't recommend this place for dinner, as most of the stuff they have here are good, but of small, bite-size portions to pair with drinks. We usually go here before dinner to grab some drinks and appetizers and hang out before dinner.  The service has always been pretty good so far.   I can't speak for their wine selection, but they do have a pretty decent whisk(e)y selection. As far as scotch goes, they break down the whiskys by regions, e.g., Islay, Speyside, Highland, etc..., which is nice. They also have a good rye and irish selection, if that's your thing. They also have a pretty good happy hour, and a whisky of the month that they'll offer at half the price.   One of the things I really enjoy about this place is their outdoor sitting area where they also offer cigars for you to enjoy with your drink. Coupled with the amazing Las Vegas weather, it makes for a very nice experience with your friends and/or loved ones.",

Overall the place hasn't changed much, it's still the romantic ambiance and sexily dressed waitresses. Their happy hour prices for alcohol were great. I chose to get a Stella, my friends opted for wine. Our waitress was upbeat and attended to our needs very well.  As for the food, I'm just going to have to say... 3.5 stars. So, a little bump for their happy hour and food, mostly because the quesadilla had really good flavor and was very different from any quesadilla I've had. Unfortunately the quesadilla is not on the happy hour menu, to which I implore management - please put it on there! During the course of the night I also had the olives (meh), and the BBQ Pork Sliders (also meh, but kudos for the sweet pickles!). The bun was soft though, but overall I've definitely had better pork sammies.   Will I return? Perhaps, when I'm in Town Square or if my friends happen to want to do happy hour here again. I am also interested in the Pre Fixe breakfast on Saturday and Sunday! So maybe I'll have to go back and try that out.",

My only reason for not giving this place 5 stars, is that during happy hour they are always conveniently out of the less expensive bottles.

    "text": "I absolutely love this place. Every time I go the bartenders are so friendly and clearly enjoy talking to their customers. They have really good daily specials and a nice happy hour. For food I love the grilled cheese and the stuffed olives. The arancini are also nice for a light snack. Also if you're a wine drinker, make sure to try their house wines. I was pleasantly suprised!",

    "text": "The server we had, Candy or Candice, was amazing. She was fun, cute, and gave a great first experience for me. However, the food and menu was a disappointment. I'm aware of it being a tapas place, but the menu was limited. The food was good, but pricey for the small portions. The fries and grownup grilled cheese was great. Do not waste your time on the flat-breads. We didn't participate in the Sunday brunch. Firefly is still the best tapas place in Vegas. I will not be rushing back to Helix, but I will return if I was with a party that all decided to go.",

    "text": "The food and drinks are OK.  But make sure you only go during happy hour as they otherwise VERY over-priced.  And watch your bill very carefully.   They charged my credit card $316 when I only signed for $186 and I'm still trying to work with my credit card and the BBB to get it worked out.   Very dishonest business.    WATCH YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENT CAREFULLY IF YOU GO TO DOUBLE HELIX !!!!!!!!",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Town Square but frequently find myself at the same few places (Yardhouse, Whole Foods haha!) so I was pretty excited to try a new place.  I met a friend for drinks and loved the extensive and creative cocktail bible (it was huge) that I was presented with.  My one complaint (that I have with most places) is the reaction I get to my request for modifications. I do not like drinks that are super sweet and am perfectly satisfied with the sugar that is found in the fruit that comes in cocktails. I ordered the 'Repo Man' - tequila, sour, agave nectar ('healthy' simple syrup), ginger syrup and muddled strawberries, apples and lemons. That's a WHOLE lotta sweet in one 8 oz glass. When I asked the bartender to keep the agave nectar out she flat out wouldn't do it, insisting I wouldn't like it. No, I'm pretty sure I know what muddled fruit and tequila will taste like, thank you.  She instead cut the amount in half and SHOCKER it was still far too sweet for me.  For my second drink, I went with the 'Nutty Mojito' - coconut vodka, coconut cream, muddled lime, mint and soda.  It was decent, definitely better than my cup o' sugar I had previously.  My friend had 2 glasses of Shiraz that were pretty fantastic so I ended up rounding my night out with a glass as well.  Overall, the vibe of the place and the decor is comfortable and I'm sure I'll go back.  But bartenders - Us drinkers KNOW what we like..TRUST US! Especially when I'm paying $10-$13 for it!",

    "text": "I am wavering between 3 and 4 stars. Yelp, this keeps happening to me...please make this an option! This bar being in the middle of open space in a mall loses points for ambiance. It just seems so oddly placed. I did like the drink selection, and highly enjoyed the cocktails they had to offer, along with the definitely-hit-the-spot cheese plate. Service was pretty good, I'd possibly come back for a glass of wine if in the Palazzo.",

    "text": "Didn't go in with high expectations as I wasn't impressed with Bottles & Burgers at Tivoli Village, but a friend wanted to try this place out. I am willing to give any place a try at least once, especially if they offer patio seating. The only bad part about their patio is it's located in between the two escalators that lead up to the second floor, so there was a lot of traffic, it was noisy and distracting. I didn't try the food, but I had their cucumber martini, wasn't bad but I've had better, and then the sangria, hands down the worst I've ever tasted. It came with a sugared rim which was strange, and it tasted like prune juice, I'm not joking. The only drink that was good was my honey jack on the rocks, can't mess that up. If you're looking for a nice outside patio, go to Brio, comfy chairs and fire pits, plenty of room and great people watching.",

    "text": "My family and I stumbled across this location as we were shopping in Townsquare when we first walked in the ambience is undeniably beautiful we were told by the awesome waitress that happy hour ended in 12 minutes. We agreed we were all going to down the first drinks so we can get the next ones before they doubled in price. Only to be told that when she asked the bar manager Jessica , she said \" no\". We were still well within the time period. When the waitress came back it was two minutes after happy hour. We ordered $160.00 in food, it was fabulous. The service was undeniably outstanding. However, we will not be back because of Jessica. When I find someplace I like I am always loyal and would have return time and time again with my friends and family. I hope the $18 savings was worth it.",
