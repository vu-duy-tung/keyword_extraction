    "text": "They really, really know what they're doing here! Our pizzas were fantastic. The crust was thin, but easily held up to the mountain of toppings without getting soggy...throughout the whole meal. My son and the grandkids constantly commented on how good it was, too. I apologize to my daughter for ruining them on cheap pizza, but even the non-crust eaters ate the crust. The toppings are super generous. You could barely see the pizza under the ham on my son's half. For a supreme pizza lover, this is the place. Go for the super,   Heck, one of the kids noted that the Coke tasted like McDonald's Coke. I can vouch for that statement. Some places have their mix a little too syrupy, but this was spot on. They have a nice espresso machine, so they may have a great water filtration system, too.   Garlic knots? Check! Bruschetta? Check!   The mango sorbet was very good, but the banana/dulce de leche gelato was unreal.",

I didn't want to review after my first pizza' it was delicious, but a mess. I ordered sausage and green pepper and the sauce was to die for. I also ordered chicken parm done perfectly! I thought this was gonna be my place! So I ordered again last night, just pizza and wings and, once again, the pizza was a mess. All the ingredients had slid to the side and cheese was resealed. You know the look. The crust is so good, the sauce perfect, but they can't get it to your house cut and toppings spread all over. I don't know what the problem is but when you receive your pizza like that, you can't get that perfect, cheesy first bite. And of course, the left overs are a mess, had to tear the pizza in where I thought the slice was. Disappointed, this would have been my new pizza home. UPDATED REVIEW: The owner, Jason, was concerned that I had received my pizza in poor condition. I reordered today, and my pizza was PERFECT! Delicious, meaty, perfect crust! Thank you for being so concerned about your customers, I really appreciate that. By the way, I also ordered the Chicken Parm, and there is something so addicting about that sauce, it's my favorite!",

    "text": "Being in Las Vegas for a week having a lot of different foods. I haven't had pizza. A good pizza place. Woke up on a later afternoon thier were no more dart competition me & my bf slept in. When we got dress my bf found this place heard a lot of great things most definitely the garlic knots. Reading the yelp reviews the garlic knots is a must try.  It's was a nice drive to get there. When we got there it my bf got a little discouraged about the place being small but we decided to go in anyways. It's a small place with 7 tables we were told to sit anywhere we like. Looked at the menu and seen a lot of pastas, sandwiches, & of course pizzas.  We were serve by a lady a nice lady asked what we wanted to drink and she mentioned about the garlic knots so we got a large order of the (12 knots). About 5 minutes later the knots came in they looked so damn good real garlic hella garlicky but good. So if you don't like a lot of garlic don't get it. Then I check in to this place & notice they had a $5 off coupon just by checking in. We had a speciality pizza we got the all meat pizza.  We were eating the knots then the pizza came in hot & fresh the cheese was zooey & cheesy it was New York style the crust was light and crispy. I had two slices I got full quick. My bf and his friend ordered zeppolis with chocolate drizzle. They LOVED it. They said it was soft & warm. I didn't want it because I don't like chocolate.  This place is wonderful. The food is great for pizza and desserts. I would definitely will go again when Im here in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "We had an excellent dining experience last night at Giovanni's Hole in the Wall. It was our first time there and we'll definitely return. Literally within 10 seconds of walking in the door we were greeted with a warm \"welcome, come on in\" from one of the owners. Our friendly waitress seated us immediately and poured us a generous glass of the house red wine as we received our menus. She made a couple of recommendations from the menu, gave us a few minutes, and came back to answer any of our questions. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer, and it was both plentiful and very tasty. The calamari has a light breading, most of it was the calamari rings, and it had a pleasant, sweet taste. They cooked it just right so there was a little firmness without being chewy. The menu says the lasagna is \"the best in town\". I decided to try it and see for myself. My wife ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. With our entrees we received two fresh house salads. The salads were made with romaine lettuce, broccoli, and cauliflower. The house dressing (vinaigrette) is made by the restaurant and is quite good. There are other dressing choices if vinaigrette is not your taste. A basket of six garlic knots came with our order as well. They were warm and smothered in butter. When our entrees came, my wife's eyes looked a little like deer in headlights because of the size of the meatballs (2) sitting on top of her spaghetti. They were close to being the size of a baseball, maybe a little bigger. The meatballs and spaghetti were yummy, the sauce was tasty with a little spiciness that didn't dominate the overall flavor. The lasagna was quite good as well. I'm not one who wants a lot of tomato-based sauce on my food (pasta or pizza). The serving did have quite a bit on top so I just slid it over. My wife said it would've been just the right amount for her. That said, next time I'd simply ask for light sauce or sauce on the side. The lasagna itself was a filling and scrumptious combination of meat, cheese, and pasta. We both had a sampling from each other's plate and gave it a thumbs up. During the dinner, the other owner came to our table to meet us, check on our food, and chat for a few minutes. He added to the welcoming environment. There was an abundance of food, so we brought a lot of it home. We did order a slice of the strawberry cheesecake to go. My wife described it as good and very creamy. The slice was on the small side. The atmosphere includes smaller tables, checkered vinyl tablecloths, a brick wall with lots of framed art, and candles in wine bottles with melted wax on the sides of the bottle. In the corner was a piano player playing enjoyable and non-intrusive lounge-style music. We were there late in the evening when there were about 15 other people in the restaurant. The room probably seats only about 40, so if it's full be prepared for a wait, and a little tighter feel as tables are close together. With our check came two complimentary creme de menthes, a nice little touch at the end. We liked the service, food and atmosphere, and we'll definitely be back.",

We ordered a small pizza, chicken fingers with fries and another side of fries ($36 with tip) for delivery through the Eat24 app on a Thursday night and it took more than an hour to deliver. The food wasn't worth the wait in any sense. First, everything was lukewarm, at best. The chicken fingers were soggy and a weird texture (yuck), the fries were dried out and cold and the ranch was watery and flavorless. The pizza (simple cheese) was the best part, but it was mediocre: not good or bad, but at least not dripping in oil or something. We won't be ordering again.",

My usual salad with tomatoes, cheese and dressing was the same recipe, but instead of thick sliced tomatoes red ripe and juicy, it was thin sliced half ripe tomatoes.  Ugg.  The cheese garlic bread had cheese, thin as possible, on 2 of the 5 pieces.  The pizza was the worst disaster of all.  About 2 to 3 pieces of sausage each piece.  Definitely not the same quality ingredients.  No friendly owner to say hello and thanks for coming in and cold careless waitress.  We won't be back.  Sorry to see the original go.  This new owner has zero chance of survival.",

Some slices had only one small piece of sausage, and no slice had a lot. That was my only gripe, but even so, I enjoyed the pizza. The crust was not quite as good as Bambino's, which is a little crisper, but it was a good pizza. I also tried the meatballs, which were good, but garlicky.",

    "text": "Well this is awkward. I do not take a bad review lightly. So, I just called to order a pizza from here, as it has been a while, and was told that I was red flagged in their system to not have my order taken. For what you might ask? Well, let me begin by saying I am never rude nor do I not pay my bill. I am polite and always tip very well. That being said let us go ahead and explore my last experience with Papa Pinny's Pizzeria. I ordered a pizza, it arrived late and cold, I accepted the pizza in my hands and tipped the driver, and upon opening the pizza box in my kitchen it was very apparent the top of the pizza had shifted as if the delivery driver took a very, very, sharp turn...  Like a U turn... which led to the pizza topping shifting a good third worth over. So when I saw this, considering how much was spent on the pie (They are by no means a cheap pizzeria), I called and politely said that I was not satisfied with the quality of the pizza as it arrived. I mean.. Hell yes I want a pizza to arrive looking like a pizza with the toppings intact, who doesn't? The person who answered the phone said they would sent out a new pizza, when the new pizza arrived the delivery driver curtly requested I return the damaged pizza, which I did. I did not choose post anything at the time because I do not like to post negative reviews and understand that sometimes things just happen. We were satisfied with the new pizza and its condition. So, this bad review is because Papa Pinny's Pizzeria clearly does not take responsibility for a poor product that was clearly their error. Shame on them.",

Great crust, excellent sauce which took me back to NYC and tasty pepperonis. I would say as an east coast guy who is a bit spoiled the only thing that keeps this pizza from being among the very best in Las Vegas is the cheese. The cheese is very good mind you but if they just went one step up in quality I would say it would take this pizza up to a higher level like Grimaldi's, Due Forni, or Settebellos, which are world class. Highly recommended.",

The marinara sauce is awful, the chicken piccata is a mess, the meatballs taste like garbage, the mozzarella sticks were burned, bottled soda was expired, and there's parsley dumped all over everything. They took a great neighborhood restaurant and turned it into crap.  Edit: I never worked at a restaurant. I live in the neighborhood where this restaurant is located and use to order from them regularly. Five months ago my husband and I received a terrible food order from them after the new owners took over. Maybe its changes are better now but I wouldn't know because I never got a response until 2 months after the fact. I'd love to try the restaurant again and give them another chance but the response below makes me doubt they care. I wish you the best.",

Some not-so-bad but we probably won't visit again, some good but too pricey to make a habit and some, like this one, that move straight to the top of the list first visit! So, it's not just the food, which is, btw, utterly fantastic...but the total surprise of the quaint and comfy Italian ambiance secreted behind the heavy drapes in a crappy little strip mall with a flashing Pizza sign (really?) and the genuinely hospitable manner with which all the guests are treated. The owner pulls up a chair at your checkered-tablecloth table with a giant one-bottle wine glass in hand, fills your UP and lights your waxy Chianti bottle candle. The menu isn't overwhelming, just enticing, and we were hard-pressed to finally decide on \"the best lasagna in Las Vegas\" and chicken piccata--(both eye-rolling divine!!!) but not before being enticed by the organic beefsteak tomato, fresh mozzarella, basil and most amazing balsamic and olive oil dressing I have ever had--with garlic love-knots, no less!!! We were stuffed like fat raviolis but couldn't leave without Giovanni's labor of love, his creamy, dreamy not-too-sweet cheesecake! Thank you, you little hole-in-the-wall....what a delightful find you are!! Shhhhhh, don't tell anyone!",

It has the classic red and white checked tablecloths, huge waxy candles in the center, housemade wine. It reminded us of our recent trip to Italy!  The service was spot on, if a bit slow. But they were every attentive during the slow time, and sent out tasty salads on the house as we waited for our pizza and fettuccine. Our drinks were never empty, but continually refreshed. These people know how to make you feel at home! The food was great! The fettuccine was DECADENT! Creamy and full of beautiful flavor. The pizza has amazing crust flavor and chew, the toppings quality. The only downside us that the pizza is a little on the salty side. The housemade cheesecake is velvety with a forward sour cream note complemented by hints of vanilla and lemon. Really good! All in all, this hole in the wall is a great spot, and I'm so glad we ate here tonight. I'll be spreading the word!",

At first it looked like just a normal pizza joint from the outside but boy were we wrong. Our server was absolutely AMAZING. I had a steak and lobster and my husband a steak with alfredo pasta it was delicious! We also had the garlic knotts, cheesecake and bottle of wine everything was just perfect. We had such a great time and we will definitely come back and try that huge pizza they have.",

    "text": "Stumbled upon this priceless, hidden gym, with my son Friday night. It felt like going back in time- old school Italian, with charm and ambiance that added to our experience. We were warmly greeted, and seated right away. House wine was poured, and fresh out of the oven garlic bread knots were served. The owner was very personable, and made us feel welcome, and the waiters were attentive and kind.  Our orders were taken (chicken parmigiana and linguine with white clam sauce) and a dinner salad was included. The guitarist and violinist played mostly throughout the meal which was great, as it added to the experience.  It didn't take long to get our meals, and it was as good as any Italian homemade meal I've made/had.  My son and I finished off the evening with splitting a slice of the incredible New York cheesecake with strawberries.  The price for our meals were beyond reasonable!  In the 19 years I've lived here, this experience was definitely at the top of time and money well spent.",

Tiny, but quaint space here in a very cozy atmosphere, accompanied by a guitar and violinist who brighten up this perfect, Italian atmosphere. We enjoyed the steak and lobster special, fettuccine Alfredo and the eggplant parmigiana. Each dish was cooked perfectly and was filled with a varietal I'd perfected tastes. Giovanni treats you like family; professional service, perfect atmosphere. Giovanni, we'll be back. Thanks again!",

You'll be surrounded by lots of Chicago memorabilia hanging on the walls as you look through a menu that isn't limited to pizza. There's plenty of other Italian-American dishes ranging from pastas to calzones to sandwiches and chicken wings.  The pizza is pretty good compared to most quickie, take-out or delivery places but not on par with the top pizza makers in town. Their crust is thin, chewy, with only slight crispness. Their meat lover's pizza is generous with toppings with a tangy sauce with some acidity to it. Their white pizza was excessively oily (yeah, I know it's a white pie, but even by those standards it was too much).   They're a clear step up from pizza chains and prices are respectable. As close as they are to my house, I'm sure I'll give them another shot and try more of their menu.",

    "text": "This was a total accidental blessing of a find! I was dropping my friend off at the gym next-door and I had a craving for garlic knots so I stopped in to see if they had any. Not only did they, without exaggeration these are the best garlic knots I've ever had in my life!! This place was so good and the pasta smell so good when I walked in the door that I took my friend back there to sit and dying in the next day.The owner was great, very friendly and offered us complementary wine. We had the fettuccine Alfredo which was bomb, and of course more of those amazing garlic knots. It is a little bit higher price then a cheap quick bite to go, but reasonable for the food and the portions. I highly recommend this if you like authentic Italian, it has a real New York feel which I do realize is not Italy, but I have not been to Italy so the best reference I can give use New York.",

Boy, am I glad we did! It's our new favorite!!! I ordered a garden salad, expecting iceberg lettuce, half a tomato, and a bit of bitter dressing, like other pizza places.What I got was such a level up, I was amazed! 4 or 5 different greens, chick peas, kidney beans, tomato, cucumber, olive, etc...beautiful array, topped with mozzarella cheese, and wonderful, homemade dressing...plus, the amazingly charming owners treated us to some extra special garlic bread...the kind my Italian grandma used to make! We ate like no tomorrow!  When the pizza came out, it was cooked to flavorful perfection! The crust was a cut above. We will definitely go back, bring friends, and hope to score more of that incredible garlic bread! Loved it!!!!",

    "text": "We drove out of our way from the Strip because of the Yelp ratings.   We got the Pinny Signature pizza. It was good, but not awesome or anything outstanding. The pizza knots were ok, but nothing memorable. The sauce for the pizza and the knots were too tomatoey for my liking and lacked typical Italian seasoning. Got the six-piece wings (hot) and they came with an order of fries. The wings and fries were both good and worthwhile.   Service was meh. The server either wasn't paying much attention or something else was amiss. Kept having to repeat and reclarify the order. There wasn't any language barrier, so I don't know...  While she was attentive, she gave off the aire of hovering over us -which was both annoying and creepy. She also stood behind the refrigeration/display counter staring in our direction when not hovering -no doubt she was watching the game on TV -but it was creepy.   I'm glad others have had good experiences here. But there are other choices for independent Mom&Pop pizzeria fare -and I think we will continue to shop around.",

Pizza was crispy but still loaded and not too think, chicken was fresh and delicious with crispy french fries and the mozzarella sticks were super cheesy! Was so yummy but not only was the food great the service was exceptional! Very warming seeing the owner helping the cook making sure our food is done and server was great!

    "text": "OMG!!! Where do I start?! First off, my order consisted of a 12\" Pinny's Signature Supreme Pizza, with extra pepperoni, extra mushrooms, extra cheese and extra sauce, and 12 pieces Jumbo Wings Medium sauce with blue cheese. It came to $42.45. Worth every heavenly morsel! My delivery time was 30 to 45 minutes it arrived at 37 minutes into the delivery time, mind you, I live on West Charleston and Torrey Pines. Kudos to the driver, he was very friendly and made my mouth wish I had ordered the garlic knots, they sound Delish! So on to the food, the smell of the pizza and wings, drew me in like those old cartoons where they levitate to the food, I kid you not! The pizza was piled high with toppings and extra pepperoni, mushrooms, cheese and sauce as I had asked! Woohoo!! It gets better, I went to lift a piece of pizza out of the box and it was a little soggy, now, I know it was contributed to all the extras so I wasn't too shocked. Now the great part! The pizza, despite a little soggyness(my fault) was beyond, it had the green and black olives, crispy pepperoni, fresh tomatoes, mushrooms( no can here) and crispy big (not too big) bacon. The onions and green peppers were fresh and crisp not soggy Now the sauce is homemade in the best way! Great seasoning! The crust was crisp on the edges and tender and flavorful. Homemade dough is the secret! Man, do they have it right, all of it! Now the catcher, I called to give my praise and Rosy answered I asked to speak to the manager, Rosy politely related that they do not have a manager, yet a owner and he was with a customer, \" Could she take a message\". I went in and praised my order from wait time, to the sauce, to delivery driver John. Best online order experience I have ever had! No question about it! Now just a little back story, I throw down in the kitchen in all styles of food, so I know my way around the kitchen. I bake,cook,grill and make all my own breads and dough. I make pizza as well, and let me to tell you, this pizza and wings made me do the happy dance and want more! I just moved today, and afterwards, did not want to cook, after being in the hot, muggy, humid air. I was skeptical, reading the reviews, I decided to give Papa Pinny's Pizzeria my coin and I am elated I did! I have lived here since 1990, and it is really hard to find a great pizza place, pizza hut has been mine because I got tired of paying big bucks to only get disappointed. I can vouch , not the case here, I hope Pappa stays around for the rest of my years in this life and then some! Don't change a thing Pappa! Don't get overwhelmed with profit margin and cut corners, and whatever you do Pappa, DO NOT FIRE ROSY OR JOHN, HECK THE PIZZA MAKER EITHER!! I appericate you!",

Small hole in the wall with only 6 or so tables, and it seems like they recently remodeled and added outdoor tables and wine decor inside.   This isn't the first time we have been here. Treated my daughter (5 years old) to a candle lit dinner last night and it was great so it reminded me to review. I didn't review in the past, because I loved the pizza but the spinach salad was sooooo greasy, and I wanted to only give a 4 or a 5 cuz I know they're trying. Waited it out and they've since removed that salad from the menu, ha!   I was at the mercy of the kindergartener, so we ended up with a cheese pizza and Caesar salad. I really liked the Caesar. Perfectly dressed...not crazy amounts of dressing.   Pizza is surprisingly good here. The crust is crisp on the bottom and sides, and chewy. I recently saw this Yelp type influencers posting videos of some pizza place that uses scissors and the guy citing talks about the \"crack crack\"...it's just like that. I like the semi tart sauce. Cheese is a little greasy since it's normal shredded mozzarella (as opposed to the buffalo mozzarella like Grimaldi's, or whatever they use there), but a very satisfying pizza.   They brought us this super tasty garlic bread (basically a super buttered, super toasted soft hoagie), complimentary.   Sit down service can be slow because there are only a few tables, and the server (who we've had every time) has to answer phones, be a hostess, put together Grub Hub orders, etc. She is a super sweet lady and I tip her 50% every time. I know she is trying her best and I appreciate her.   I'm sad that we will be quitting piano at this location and it's pretty far for us to drive, but we will be back.",

We ordered pasta which comes with garlic knots but we weren't given any with our meal. We asked about the missing items and the server made us aware that the cook never even made them . We waited patiently but after 30 minutes of no knots we decided to eat without them. The server kept apologizing but the cook in the back seem to careless . Over an hour with NO KNOTS!!!

That meant I could double-check my on-line order after it arrived.  Sure enough, I had ordered what I thought I had ordered, but that's not what got delivered.  One of our two pizzas was the wrong size.  Our side pasta bore no resemblance at all to the description on the menu, and was nearly inedible.  (Here's a tip, Giovanni's - fettuccine is not a small tubular pasta, and lobster is not the same thing as calamari.)  This is the second place in Vegas (that I know of) that bills itself as a \"hole in the wall.\"  In both cases that description is pretty accurate, and not in a good way.

    "text": "OMG! This place is hands down 1 of..if not THE BEST Pizza/Italian food I've ever had! 1st, let's start of with the ambiance, it's so adorable. It's small & intimate but its perfect. I felt like I was at a legit Italian restaurant in Italy. The music, the decor, the setting was just amazing. The service was 100000% on point. The moment we set foot in the place, we were greeted & seated. The whole staff was so nice & helpful. They made us feel so welcome. We sat down & instantly got attended, our server I believe was the owner himself & his attention to detail catering to us was phenomenal. He went over the specials, what was popular & what he recommended & it was just nice. He served us a cup of this amazing wine that he assured went well with everything on the menu. & lemme tell you, he was right. The wine he gave us paired well with EVERYTHING we ordered. It was complimemtaey btw, for us being 1st time customers. He also hooked us up with some Garlic Knotts, a House Salad & the wine...on the house! Everything was made fresh! Most definitely worth the wait! Ugh I cant get enough of this place. I fell in love with it & the food! We ordered a meat lovers pizza, a calzone, chicken alfredo & the Caprese Salad. I cannot lie when I say all of it was exquisite!  IT was just beyond delicious, words just simply cannot describe how good this food was. You have to try it for yourself 2 understand. I HIGHLY recommend this place. I will most definitely be coming back. The ingredients taste so fresh & it all tasted so good. The alfredo was my favorite, the sauce was 2 die for! You can just taste the quality of the ingredients. So rich & creamy. Perfection! I also ordered the cheesecake but I have yet 2 try it because I'm so full, but ugh. More people need to know & come to this divine establishment. I can go on for DAYS reviewing how amazing the food was & the exceptional customer service of this restaurant but I will let yall experience it for yourselves! Please, next time you are in the mood for authentic, delicious, exquisite food. Come 2 Giovanni's. You will not regret it. A hole in the wall it is indeed. Amazing, simply amazing beyond all rationality. I simply cannot put into words how happy I am with this place.",

The stromboli had lots of cheese but you had to search for the pepperoni. Also, the marinara sauce was bland. The shrimp Alfredo was excellent but they forgot the garlic knots. When I asked for them the server acted like I didn't order them...even though they come with the pasta. In the end, I left a tip for the pasta but zilch for the stromboli. Perhaps they had an off day...but I will not be returning.",

    "text": "First: Ordered a pizza for delivery. A bit pricey at $25+ for a supreme, but the pizza was huge and loaded up with toppings. Crust was good, sauce had flavor, and there was plenty of cheese. Order arrived on time, if not a bit early. It's rare for me to do delivery, but this is a place I'd keep in mind for the future. Four stars!  Second: Came in to pick up an order of pasta. Location is cozy, staff was polite, order was again ready quickly. The chicken piccata has protein, pasta, a bread stick and a side salad, all nicely priced for $14. Unfortunately, the sauce makes this dish and it was lackluster. Something was missing, it was just okay. The side salad was ordered with bleu cheese dressing which seemed to be either a cheap bottled brand or made in-house by someone who doesn't know it. It was gross and ruined the salad. Two stars?  Third: Ordered takeout again, got the antipasto salad with the bruschetta app. Ton of food, around $15. The bruschetta was fine but the salad was a bust. Looked more like a plate of cold cuts with meats and cheeses on a scant handful of spring mix. \"House italian\" dressing was a creamy version that was gross and brown? The whole thing looked and tasted like it was made by someone who doesn't like salads for other people who don't like salads. But the bruschetta was good. Three stars it is.  TLDR: Stick to the pizza and maybe the appetizers. Order pickup or delivery through the app, they're quick and friendly.",

    "text": "So I wanted to be lazy and order in so I chose this place using the GrubHub application via Yelp.  I put in all the info and it said estimated arrival 9:34 pm and by 9:40 pm I am calling Giovanni's asking where my pizza is.  A nice lady Annie answers and puts me on hold and come to find out GrubHub never faxed them!  So why did I give this place a 5?  Its not the restaurant's fault but they took full responsibility which was impressive.  Pizza and bruschetta was great just like their customer service.  Annie was so nice, had the food delivered in 15 minutes, threw in a 10 dollar voucher and apologized for something that wasn't her fault (shame on GrubHub). Now let's talk food. The bruschetta was fresh and flavorful and is a must at this place.  I chose the Mexican pizza because the only other place I've experienced that had such an option was the chain Godfathers pizza (so good).  If a taco and a pizza had a baby this would be their love child.  Ground beef,  chorizo, jalapenos, sour cream, tomatoes, olives . . . food fusion at its best.  Only thing it was missing was a lil shredded lettuce on top and maybe a few beans in the mix. Otherwise still amazing .  Conclusion: throw some hot sauce on this pizza and have a fiesta in your mouth.",

My kids complimented on it and the cheese was high quality, not like Little Caesars or any other commercial pizza parlors. The house salad was amazing.. We are from California and we were at a nearby baseball park for a tournament this restaurant was well worth it we will always come back when we are in town thank you for such a delicious meal and kind service.",

We have tried almost every pizza place in town and we have finally found a pizza that blows every other place in town away.  We found  it on Yelp, and decided lets go......what a stroke of luck and genius.  Walked in smelled amazing, the owner Jason greeted us right away and recommended a pizza.  WOW, YUMMY, the crust is crisp and delicious and the toppings (Pepperoni & Sausage and Veggies) were to die for..(think he brings in his ingredients from Chicago, where he's from)  The prices are reasonable, beer was cold and the place is spotless.  We were planning our return trip on the way home.  Way to go Jason!!!!!  John & Jayne (Packer fans, sorry)",

There are a couple of TVs in there & filled with football stuff! definitely a place to hang out at for game nights.   So we ordered a couple of things starting with the garlic knots. Myyyyyy goodness. These were amazing! By far the best I've had in Vegas. Came out hot & fresh & just amazing. Probably my favorite out of everything that we ordered. We got a large margarita pizza & with the check-in, it's $5 off! I'm not sure if I even liked margarita pizzas before today??? Lol but this pizza was soooo good! Hot, fresh, crispy crust, good flavoring. Idk what else you can really ask for. We also ordered zeppolis ,or however you spell it, to go. These were okay. I'm not sure if it was cos we took it to go? They weren't bad though.   The nice lady always made sure to ask if we were okay, or if we needed anything, and made sure our waters were never empty. Really good customer service!   Overall, definitely one of the best pizzerias in the valley. Will keep coming back! Even if it's quite a drive lol.",

However this last time, they got my pizza order wrong, and then did not double cut as we always get, and then argued about the situation after the fact. Not that hard guys.   I didn't blame the order taker or the pizza cook. But a guy came from the back and was totally disrespectful, full of profanity. I called for the owner who came from the back.  He was rather apologetic, but the guy from the back continued with the profanities. I could  not believe it. Giovanni , the owner, stood there and listened to him shout profanities and did nothing.  He disappeared after 2min.   Mistakes happen. I have no problems with mistaken orders. But I cannot believe the absolute poor service, profanities, and the owner cowering to an employee, despite clear mistakes. No, i will never be back. Giovanni is the new owner. He's in for a rough year.  There are at least a half dozen pizza places within a mile from here. It's not about one pizza order, right or wong. if I'm right, they will be out of business in 18months.",

The pizza? Not a fan. I ordered their version of a margarita (sp?) and one half pepperoni half cheese.   As soon as I took a slice of the first, the tomato and one basil leaf with a slice of unmelted mozzarella slid off entirely. The pizza is covered in sauce and they place a regular slice of tomato, one leaf of basil, and a slice of fresh mozzarella. The mozzarella is poor quality. It didn't melt and the consistency and flavor were totally off. It tasted like rubber. I wanted to give it another chance, but the second slice was completely soggy. Wet pizza crust from the tomato and too much sauce. Would not recommend ordering.   The second pizza I took a slice of and because the ratio of cheese to crust was out of balance, the toppings came completely off.   Way too much cheese for a super thin crust. The texture of the crust was ok, but the crust doesn't have enough salt in the dough. The sauce is ok. A bit tart, but decent if not completely drowned by cheese.   The timing and service were really good.  The pizza. Some of the worst I have had in a long time. Won't order again.",

Very fresh.   The house salad was also delicious.  I enjoyed the spaghetti which had fresh parsley.  Meat balls were A+.  Very good.   The lobster ravioli was excellent.  I also tried the clam sauce which was very good too.  One of the best in town I was told.  Someone also ordered the fettuccine and loved it.   So I highly recommend, but go with patience and to enjoy the atmosphere which is unique.",

As far as service goes, Victor is a True professional. Extremely outgoing, nice, and was able to guide us through the menu and answer any questions. The owner, Davo, is who I aspire to be. Walks around with a HUGE wine glass just chatting to the guests. If you don't try his cheese cake then you are truly cheating yourself. It's perfectly airy and creamy at the same time, it's absolutely amazing.  Wish I could give this place 10 stars. Can't wait to go back!!",

    "text": "Edited review--the owner contacted me immediately upon reading my review and offered me a dinner for two this was incredibly caring to immediately attempt to rectify the situation, which I greatly appreciated. I wish Giovanni the best!  Review: Greatly disappointed in the customer service and my order tonight. We are visiting from Seattle and I wanted to go somewhere off the strip, I thought this place sounded perfect, big mistake! I ordered a to-go order via GrubHub and we picked it up, they weren't busy at all my husband had a nice conversation with the host who had been having a nice conversation with another guest at the bar eating his spaghetti. We drove 10mi back to where we were staying...we ordered one spaghetti meal which is spaghetti, salad, garlic bread, and in addition a mozzarella appetizer,  also on the receipt clearly written was \"please add napkins and utensils.\" That's forgivable if they didn't have utensils, no problem. We left a $4 tip for the to go order online ($30) and left. However, when home we discovered there was no salad and no garlic bread, sigh.., so I call and ask for the manager just to let them know to quality control before the order leaves the door and the host or the individual answering the phone said \"call back in five minutes (I did not let him know there was a problem with the order I just said I need to speak to the manager) the manager is in a meeting with one of the owners.\" So I called back and it goes to a fax, so I called back again and I was placed on hold and then eventually hung up on so I called back again and I said I'm waiting for the manager and he says, \"oh that's right\" and hangs up on me again (mind you I didn't mention wants to him that he hung up on me already) so I call back the fourth time and I get the fax again, finally I called back the fifth time and said I'm waiting for a manager and he said he was the manager, different voice, I told him I had gotten an order to go he said \"I packed it up myself\" I said  the garlic bread and the salad isn't in the order...long pause....tick-tock, and then he said \"I usually keep the salads put away until you arrive for pick up to keep them cold and I'm staring at the bread right now.\" Oh great that doesn't make me feel any better you're staring at my hot garlic bread that I was craving! I proceeded to let him know I was just calling to give him feedback regarding quality control before to-go orders leave, and told him about phone issue, he said, \"Well that's rude,\" re phone issue. I felt it was sarcastic, that he was just trying to sweeten up the situation, all in all he said he could offer us an in-store credit I declined and I said we won't be back because we are from Seattle, he then gave me somewhat of a genuine apology. All in all I would've had a greater experience had I went to Albertson's and got a jar Ragu and cooked it myself!!! He also gave  me the typical excuse of a manager, \"oh he must've been busy\" referring to the guy at the front, umm no he wasn't!   In this area the key to success is excellent customer service and accuracy! There are 1000 other pasta joints I could've went to!",

From my giant $6 glass of wine, to Gio himself I loved everything about this small Italian hidden gem.  The outside looks like a place to grab a slice, and it is, but it's so much more than pizza. You walk into a romantic dim lit setting with Italian music playing, and a friendly staff, including the boss man Gio, his huge glass of wine, and welcoming attitude won me over before I even tasted the mouthwatering lasagna. Which was truly just that, literally the best lasagna I've had since my Aunt Paula's. The guy went for the steak and lobster special and was happy with everything other than the lobster. Said he'd pass on it a second time but the steak was of a decent quality and the homemade mushroom sauce on top is the real treat. Including wine and dessert we spent $60 and I can't remember the last time we have done that at a nice Italian restaurant for date night. Even if you're not in the area, it's worth the drive at least once. I can't wait to return and try more of their offerings!",

We ordered a large Supreme Pizza, a medium White  Pizza, Chicken Fingers and Fries, Pasta with Garlic and Olive Oil. Supreme pizza was very tasty, lots of great flavor, but the crust didn't support the amount of toppings. Wish they would have cooked a bit longer. The White Pizza would have been amazing except they use frozen chopped spinach, not fresh! I won't order that particular pizza again. The chicken fingers were great! Some of the best I have had, the French Fries were not crispy.... but it was delivered so I won't hold that against them.  The delivery part weighs in again with the pasta. The flavors are amazing! But wish the pasta was a bit more al dente. It's hard to have good pasta delivery!!! The side salad was great! That was a nice surprise for a pizza place!  This one was tough to review. Three stars because of delivery issues on the quality of the food, but I think if you eat in it would be much better!",

The portions are just right, not too much at all that I will consider fattening (and I do eat quite a bit); prices are very fair.   Overheard a young couple (white male, Asian female) who recently moved to Las Vegas from California give their two cents to the waitress suggesting that the garlic bread should have been made all-you-can-eat, and that the portions should be bigger. I found it funny considering she was less than 5' and plump.   In any case, I recommend this place for a bite to eat and a place to chill out. Nothing fancy, just good food, with the right serving portions! Will definitely be back!",

Y'all were right and for that, I thank you! Covered in buttery goodness and chunks of real garlic, I'm a fan. I honestly would just order those along next time with extra sauce. Pay for the extra sauce people and dunk your little hearts out.  The pizzas were simply okay. I had their signature supreme and although it was loaded with toppings, it lacked in the cheese and sauce. The crust was delicious. A little crunch and a whole lotta flavour. The white pizza was delicious in flavour but the crust was a miss for me. Perhaps I could order the white pizza with the supreme crust next time? I dunno! I'll have to ask.  I did drive across town and back for the order (we're talking 20 minutes and then some each way) so no points deducted for the food not being hot. When I picked up the boxes the food was piping hot and my car smelled of marinara and garlic for days. I was able to order pickup through the Yelp app, my order was accurate, and the staff was super nice.  I was surprised to see the intimate space set up like a little Italy. Different styles of tables and chairs for your to dine in. They even have a few tables set up outside. It would be a really cute little date night spot. It's True love if you both order your own garlic knots and don't mind kissing after.",

The place is very small, seats maybe 20-25 people, but the ambiance is fantastic! If you have children in strollers or you need a high chair, find a different restaurant. This is not a place for small kids. The food was great! My husband ordered a pizza and I had the spaghetti and meatball. Yes, you read that right, one large meatball. It's all you need.  We were stuffed after eating but we were convinced to try the cheesecake. The lightest cheesecake I've ever had in my life! He wouldn't reveal his secret, but it was so good! The wine that was paired with the food was fantastic! I think it was the house wine.  Highly recommend this place to everyone, locals and tourists alike!",

The pizza was delicious and they don't skimp on the toppings!  I love that the layout of the restaurant is simple and cozy - the decor and atmosphere made me feel right at home.  Also, Rosie was our server and she was absolutely amazing from start to finish. She is such a warm and genuine spirit and made my dining experience that much more memorable.  The quality of food is excellent and I'll be sure to make another visit soon! My hunt for amazing pizza on the west side has come to an end here at Pinny's!",

There is a hidden gem, on west Sahara Boulevard, Papa Pinny's Pizzeria.  Last evening, we enjoyed a very expensive family meal. This evening, we were looking for a good Italian meal that wouldn't require a second mortgage. Frankly, I was hesitant to dine at a pizzeria because we wanted a sit-down meal and more than pizza. Papa Pinny's was a great choice.  From our salads, garlic knots and garlic bread starters, to our entrees, that included chicken marsala and salmon, everything was exceptional. Rosie, our server, was very attentive and made terrific recommendations. I rarely give five star ratings but Papa Pinny's deserves it. Be aware that the atmosphere is pure pizzeria with limited seating.   When we return to Las Vegas, Papa Pinny's is on our dining list.",

Being from the east coast Manhattan, what I like to do sometimes is a slice taste test and It would've been cool if they had slices any hr instead only during lunch time specials. It was evening and needed a quick bite but had to settle for a small pie. They probably were running out of sauce cause the 12inch I ordered didn't had much and it was like a light spread coating, the dough and cheese is what filled me up instead. I should've ask to put it back in the oven and cook it more for a mild darker edge cause the crust was too softy bread white all around. Maybe if I'm across the way next time I'll go for a well done thin crust. The women behind the counter was courteous and friendly thou. It's aaiight as we say ..",

They also have a great happy hour! 2 for 1 wine or beer, half priced appetizers, and free tapas with wine or beer. The service was great. Papa Pinny himself came out and took very good care of us.

I was in the same plaza getting an eye exam with my daughter and decided to stop in for lunch while we waited for our glasses to be finished.  I had not read any yelp reviews before going there.  Seating are clean and inviting.  You can see back into the kitchen which was equally clean.  Awesome!  We were greeted and waited on by the manager, Dave who made us feel welcome.  He told us about the place, how long they had been there, etc...  It was just pretty cool to chat with him.  I kept it pretty simple for my first time in, I got a 2 slice lunch special and my daughter got the spaghetti.  Both were amazing!  I have been back several times since but always get pizza, it is that great.  They do have a chef there, not a \"cook\" who makes some great looking dishes.  I have seen what others around me are eating and I keep saying I am going to try something different, but I always stick with what I know.  Also now, our friend Rosie works there! We know her from way back and the most friendliest person you can meet.    This is my new local pizza hang out.",

It was as good as a frozen microwave meal.No real flavor or any depth to the sauces. We've pretty much had a couple of bites, ate the bread and the rest lingered in the fridge for days. Italian food never sits around in our home.   This was really a disappointing experience; pretty much the exact opposite of what was anticipated because of the reviews. I know we only had two dishes, could have been a bad day but do I really want to go for seconds? No, it was so unappetizing   In my opinion, I would not recommend this place to anyone. I am better off making my own as I have been.",

Jason F greeted us as we walked in, and explained the menu as well as their signature menu items.  The place had a relaxed atmosphere, and great food.    I ordered the eggplant Parmesan entree.  It came with pasta, along with a bread stick and a small salad... The house dressing was awesome!  We also ordered a cheese pizza for the kids, and a Cesar salad. The food was excellent, and priced well. We will definitely return to this restaurant.",

Our waitress was an older Italian lady seemed like she was having a bad day. We were the only table in the place and we still had to get her attention to fill our drinks. In our opinion she should've retired 10 years ago. Maybe this place is better for delivery but in our opinion there are better Italian options in the area. Such as Roma deli for a great lunch or Nora's for great sit down dinner.",

If you're visiting Vegas, or are lucky enough to live here you should eat here. You WON'T be disappointed! If my fiance approves, then it's truly worth it.

Upon entering I was taken back at how small it was, only about 12 tables and a 3 seat bar up front. Then my head exploded.  We were greeted by an exceptional waiter/counter person who  poured us homemade wine, kept great conversation, joked and kept working like it was his house. We ordered a pizza and the mushroom ravioli. While it cooked, the owner, Dave, came to us with fried polenta treats, more wine (his glass was gigantic) and kept up the conversation. It was fabulous. We took the food to go and the pizza was extraordinary!! The mushroom ravioli was great as well and the sauce it came in would make my hand taste great!!  We will be back to this place often!!",

He sure knew how to read someone's energy. I tend to be very upbeat so he matched that attitude with enthusiasm. He took the cake and told me he'd see me in an hour (my reservation was for an hour later).   Came back with my friend and of course we got seated immediately. The decor inside this cute location definitely makes for a great date. The red and white tablecloths provided you with a True italian feel. The candles and dim lighting gave off such an alluring ambiance. It definitely slows down the pace and allows you to enjoy your meal. They had great music playing as well that matched the tone of the restaurant.   The host/waiter ( think his name was Victor) and poured my friend a glass of wine to celebrate his birthday. We ordered the caprese salad and got their medium supreme pizza.   The food came out with good timing. We had the salad first. Their tomatos were clearly fresh and organic. We enjoyed the mozzarella cheese that was used. The basil and balsamic sauce over the salad was perfect. Victor came by with some garlic bread to bring the salad together.  What a wonderful appetizer.   My friend and I are pretty big pizza lovers. We've definitely tried a variety of pizza places around Vegas. We bit into the supreme pizza slice that we ordered and it was heavenly. The crisp crunch and blend of the flavors on this pizza was wonderful. We were also satisfied with the pizza size.   Giovanni, the owner was walking around greeting people. He stopped by our table and greeted us. He said happy birthday to my friend and even offered their specially homemade new york cheesecake with ricotta cheese.   They came out with the cheesecakes and sang happybirthday to my friend. We asked for our check and finished up.   Honestly, the restaurant and the staff just felt like home. It felt like we were stepping into someone's home and they were just treated us like family. I hope to come back with more friends and continue to explore the menu.  Thank you for having us over!",

The pizza is delicious and they are generous with the toppings. I'll typically start with the knots which are pretty amazing! They have minced garlic on the top with I think some olive oil. I don't waste any of it ! If some of it falls off I save it to put on my pizza. I love ...love garlic!   The customer service is great! I brought  coupons with me the server let me know which one would be the most beneficial.  My drink was also topped off often so that is always a plus for me. When you are thinking about ordering from a pizza chain I would suggest trying this place out! I like trying new things instead of eating the same old pizza. The knots are worth the trip alone!",

We were a party of 6 (part of our hockey team that was in for a tournament from Houston) and I looked at yelp to find a place to eat close to our Air BnB. I said \"hole in the wall? its gotta be good!\" and when we walked in and saw how small it was we were worried about out size being accommodated or just being those diffract customers none of us want to be. They immediately took us and moved some things around to make sure we were seated. Giovanni welcomed us and had such a great attitude and sense of humor. We had decided to splurge and so glad we did. The garlic knots were out of this world and the house wine was pretty good (not to mention the fantastically large glasses!). We had the calamari and caprise salad for appetizers - so good! Everyone loved their main dishes (lasagna, eggplant parm, two steaks (WOW- so good), ravioli) and we raved for days to the rest of our teammates. Giovanni sold us on the dessert with his description and since we had decided we were splurging we went for it (ordered three for the table) and OM MY! - decadent....  We felt so comfortable and at home due to the atmosphere and the service, not to mention Giovannis personality just makes you feel like family.   I spoke to Giovanni about having a team party there next year, thinking we might fill the whole restaurant as there are 20 of us and he said not a problem! We will definitely be back next year and maybe more than once!   This hidden gem is a must go for locals and visitors alike - I promise you will not be disappointed!",

I just deleted a lengthy explanation but wiped it  - I will not be returning here.  If you enjoy being told that the server never gets anything wrong (so that you, the customer, must be wrong to dare suggest that you did, in fact, not order what the server rather rudely delivered to the table), and when a fix may have been super simple but alas, was not even attempted... Nah.   Not going back",

    "text": "Really Great Experience. Giovanni is a funny guy. The health district came in and gave Giovanni a C for their health score and Giovanni plastered the sign all across his restaurant and invited Dirty Dining to come and fight against it. The episode will air this Wednesday at 11pm. We had the privilege of staying and eating in the restaurant while all of this was going on.   Based on past experiences and their quality of food, I would say they are an A for cleanliness and food preparation. I think the health inspectors dinged them for the number of chairs in the cramped restaurant (it's a hole in the wall) and also, they only have one server or waitress taking orders for everyone. I can see how they would lose points for that as well, as things might be left on the counter for a few minutes, so they can help another customer.  Giovanni has been nothing but courteous and friendly. His staff is extremely nice too. This place has the best Italian food I've ever had, and their cheesecake is top notch (blows cheesecake factory out of the water). Apparently, Giovanni stays until 2am everynight to make it fresh. He only sells it by the slice because he runs out of stock fast. He's given us a gift card each time to offset the wait and to give excellent customer service. I am going to nominate him and his business for Customer Service Excellence with the Las Vegas Metro Chamber Of Commerce because they simply are one of the best in Vegas! That way Giovanni will have something that is TRUTHFUL to hang on his walls for his AMAZING food and EXCELLENT customer service instead of the joke C-grade inspection the money-grabbing health district put on his little restaurant. It's very rare to be in a restaurant where the owner cooks and eats with your family. You know Giovanni really cares about his food, his reputation, and his customers, and that makes this place one of the best dining experiences in Vegas.",

Very homey setting, with candles in wine bottles with wax drippings on the sides, checkered table cloths and wine and wine glasses. We ordered calzone which was huge, stuffed with cheese, pepperoni and mushrooms. Lasagna which was delicious and eggplant parmesan.  We also got garlic knots which was a little overdone but still delicious and homemade cheesecake for dessert which was creamy, rich and sensational.  This little place is definitely worth checking out. Our waitress Shanna was very friendly and attentive to our needs. We definitely will spread the word that this place is a must go to eat place when hungry for Italian food. We will be back",

The marinara is the best in Las Vegas.  We've been there a few times and always try something new.   Everything is delicious.  We always start with his house salad which is fresh greens topped with a zingy vinaigrette served with garlicky knots.  And last night we tried the pizza.  Wow.  Hand tossed and baked perfectly.  Lots of toppings but not soggy.  We tried the cheesecake and it's not the usual but a wonderful blend of cheeses.   Still trying to identify what kinds........  But I saved the best for last:  Giovanni.  He greets you at the door and makes you feel like you're a family member.    This is a place you really need to try.   Family or couples it's absolutely wonderful!",

It seemed like the kitchen was larger than the seating area where I would guess there is seating for 20 total inside.  Our experience was that the food was delicious, the service so-so, and the atmosphere charming.  After greetings us like old friends, Giovanni poured us all a glass of wine that was delicious!  I never learned, but we assumed it was their house wine.  We ordered the calamari appetizer and was such a generous portion!  The three of us typically fight over the meager quantity, but there was no need at Giovanni's.  And it was served with nummy marinara too.  I ordered mozzarella sticks but received the caprese salad instead.I tried to get Giovanni's attention to make sure he meant for me to have the salad but gave up after a while.   Taking this as a sign that I should have chosen healthier than mozzarella sticks anyway, my husband and I enjoyed the salad.   We also all enjoyed our main courses: steak Napoli for my husband who just raved over the sauce, broccoli chicken for my teenage son who thought it was good, and eggplant parmagiana for me and it was delicious too.  The food was good but I didn't get my requested water until the end of the meal.  I think I heard that they were short staffed that night so patience was a little necessary.   I almost forgot to mention the live music (we went on a Friday night) and it was really good and added to the whole atmosphere.",

It doesn't even come close to Rocco's pizza Summerlin location (across from Red Rock Casino)  The 4 cheese pizza was way way too salty, with too much sauce which was overly acidic. The fettuccine Alfredo had no taste and the sauce tasted like it came from a can. The grilled chicken in the Alfredo was the only thing that saved the dish and was pretty good. We also had a side of meatballs which the sauce also tasted like it came straight out of a can. They were also way too salty and didn't have much flavor. The texture was also not great.   Nora's or Gino's has much better pasta. Rocco's for pizza.",

I asked to apply a coupon that came attached to their menu for $3 off a $20 order because it qualified by $3 and change.    The cashier is new and needed to call her boss Jason (or James?) in order to apply the discount.  After a prolonged hold she told me that they would NOT honor the coupon because the taxes can't count toward the order.    I told her that answer didn't make any sense, and reconfirmed that my subtotal was $23 without taxes, which should amply qualify my order for the coupon.  She agreed.  I asked to speak with her boss but she said he wasn't there, she had to call him on the phone.    Rather than wait another 20 minutes to get the food underway I just put the order on my card without the discount and told her that I would Yelp it.  I'm blown away that in this age of Yelp and Social Media, a pizza joint would refuse to honor their own coupon.",

When we received the pizza it looked like the driver did donuts in the parking lot and gave it to us. I'm giving it a 4 star rating because when we called to complain they were very kind and rushed the second pizza to us in 20 minutes.

Almost a year old - if you are looking for a Chicago style pizza (Chicago thin), Chicago dogs with fries and Italian beef - some of the best comfort foods in the city.  The owner and staff are from the Windy City - so if you are from Illinois like myself....stop by and check them out.  Great food and friendly neighborhood eatery.  I will be back to try some of the Italian food and some pizza pie.",

The garlic knots had an amazing flavor and the texture was divine. Highly recommend the garlic knots. The pizza crust was cooked perfectly and the cheese on the pizza was the best we've ever tasted. Chicken was tender and the alfredo sauce was creamy and consistent. Best meal in Vegas. Highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "We like to support mom and pop businesses and gave this place a shot. The service was slow, very slow. The salad was bland - was there any salad dressing on it? Drinks were served with plastic straws (both for water glasses and soda glasses). A diet drink had two straws in it to signify which glass was diet. Talk about non-environmentally friendly!   It took 40 minutes to get our food order - unbelievable considering there are only a handful of tables in the entire restaurant. And by a \"handful\", I mean 5-6 total tables!  The eggplant parmesan dish was so-so; a bit undercooked. The four-cheese pizza didn't have enough pizza sauce on it, even though we asked for extra sauce. Condiments (specifically the peppercorns) were provided in a half-empty container. We asked for basic Italian bread with our spaghetti and they only could provide garlic knots. The table was so small, we barely could fit the pizza, eggplant dish, drink glasses and our eating plates.    The experience here was well under our lowest expectations, and so far below, it doesn't even deserve to be called a Hole-in-the-Wall.  \"Hole-in-the-walls\" usually have enough character to elicit a fun experience which you want to share with friends and family.  Not here.",

Perhaps the worst I've had in Vegas since living here. I got the Chicken Marsala w fettuccine and a small supreme pizza.   The Chicken Marsala barely had any sauce, flavor and the chicken was extremely dry. It tasted like a microwave dinner. The pizza was beyond lackluster in any flavor and sauce.   It literally felt as though I threw $35 dollars into the trash can.  What a waste, the people who worked there were very nice and friendly.",

    "text": "My boyfriend decided to surprise me with going to Giovanni's Hole in the Wall, Sunday, at 4:00 P.M. He saw all of the rave reviews for Giovanni's Hole In The Wall and decided to bring me there.  As soon as we walked in, we noticed the tables were not properly setup. The waitress came over and provided us seating at a round table. It was not properly evened out and was wobbly. There was no table placing, no silverware, or napkins for us initially until after our appetizers arrived.  We had ordered the following  10 Garlic Knots White-Pizza [Small] Spaghetti and Meatballs Chicken Alfredo (We originally asked for Lasagna, but they were out of the Lasagna).   Typically, a lot of Italian places comes with just bread and butter for the table. I had asked the waitress, and she said their restaurant doesn't do that. It also was extremely hot in the restaurant. Their AC wasn't working properly. It felt like it was about 90 degrees inside.  The appetizers came out [2] salads and the garlic knots. The salads were a mixture of spinach, and romaine lettuce, a typically garden salad, with a Italian/lemon vinaigrette topped with mozzarella. It was okay. I didn't care for the lemon vinaigrette dressing. It had too much lemon for a Italian flavored dressing.  The garlic knots were under-cooked. In the middle of the garlic knots was dough that wasn't cooked all of the way. We finally had to ask for table placements to the waitress.  Our food came out shortly afterwards.   The Spaghetti and Meatballs was under-flavored. It needed more salt. The sauce tasted like it came from a can jar, then actually home-made. The Meatballs were a little too spicy. There was jalapenos in the meatballs which made it pretty much inedible for me. My kids couldn't eat it either.   The Chicken Alfredo lacked flavoring and seasons as well. It tasted more of a Parmesan and butter sauce. The chicken in the Chicken Alfredo was overcooked and tasted rubbery.  The White Pizza was uneventful. There was way too much cheese on the White Pizza that you could taste any other ingredient on it. The dough in the middle was under-cooked because there was too much ingredients on the pizza. The meal was quite expensive as well, coming out to $70.00. I don't plan on coming back to Giovanni's Hole In the Wall.",

We ordered from a very wide selection of dinners. The crispy eggplant Park & chicken parm. Both came with pasta and very large portions. House salad was crisp n cold.  I asked a couple that was leaving if they enjoyed the meal . She said best meatballs n pasta . He said he had chicken parm and after a few glasses the wine got better.

When we stepped inside, we realised exactly why the restaurant was given the name that it had. The space itself is very small, however the owner has done a great job in avoiding making it seem cramped and the space is used very well.   The restaurant itself is so unique and interesting! There's so much to look at, from the art on the walls that add some culture and colour to the space and the people that fill it! Our server - a young man - was very friendly and accommodating and a man I believe to be the owner (with a very large glass of wine!) came over to welcome us and made us feel at home. They strike the right balance between being friendly and hands on, but also leaving you to enjoy your evening.  The food itself was also delicious!! We went for the ultimate pizza to share (basically all toppings) and it was so good!! You can order by the slice or from 12 up to 20\" pizzas I believe. Crispy crust, not overly greasy and full of flavour. Food came out quite quickly and in the meantime, the owner made sure we had enough drinks flowing and some garlic bread to snack on.  We wished we could have managed one of their homemade desserts or shared another entree but with full stomachs, there will always be a next time!  Can't wait to return!",

Be advised, the dining area is relatively small, so if they get busy, there might be a wait.  The highlight of the visit was the gentleman who served us today, as well as helped cook.  He was FANTASTIC!  Always stopping by to check on us and getting whatever we needed immediately, give him a raise.  He also mentioned his busser called out, so he was doing double duty.  The food was excellent.  We ordered mozz sticks, the Bigga steak & lobster ($26, includes sauce and pasta), chicken parm sandwich, lasagna, shrimp & lobster ravioli, Mardi Gras pasta (I think) and mushroom ravioli.  All of the items were fresh, well prepared and very tasty.  The steak and lobster value cannot be beat anywhere, any time.   Do not miss an opportunity to visit this spot, it was great!",

The pepperoni pizza I had was greasy but exactly how I prefer it, dripping.  The mozzarella cheese is excellent quality.  The consistency of the service has been great both visits here.  The chief is a well spoken, understanding person and takes pride in his cooking.  May 19th at 2:30 PM was my first time here.  I chose to dine in with my friend from Rhode Island in town.  I had ordered a Philly cheesesteak with mushrooms & peppers it was really good! I didn't snap a picture because it was so good to split.   Last night (June 4th 8 PM) I placed a pick up order for large pepperoni pizza because hubby was getting out from work.  Honestly we loved it to go too!  I see some reviews complaining about soggy salad for delivery when it's difficult to transport cold items with hot items.  I would suggest sticking with hot food if you request delivery.  If not, you should definitely dine like we did our first visit.  Very nice tables and furniture to get comfortable.  I love this cozy place. It's 7 minutes from our house.",

It looked amazing but I was stuffed. This is a True hole in the wall some how when you walk in the service, smells and food make you feel like you're your favorite restaurant with your family/loved ones (and I went by myself). It was highly  advised to make reservations but given that i went alone I did not and was seated promptly. Service was very quick and the perfect amount of friendly. Home made ravioli (to die for) comes w knots and house salad which were also sensational. Not too salty but very flavorful. So excited to return. Can't wait until my fam visits and I can bring them here.  Till then i will continue to explore then menunext stop cheesecake.",

The place is definitely small as it used to be a pizza place, so don't expect a large restaurant. Let's get right to the food, my all time favorite is Chicken Picatta, so delicious. My husband loves his homemade lasagna, eggplant Parmesan New York style, chicken marsala, and amongst many other things that I don't recall!  His calamari appetizer is a nice huge portion very  delicate, not tough or chewy. Then there's his homemade cheesecake, it's the best I've ever had!",

If you're in a dinky congested small space that can't even seat 40 people, one kid will seem overwhelming as it is. Welp, we had three! Get over it. The owner wants to be accommodating to who he wants to serve. As a business owner, anyone who comes out of their way to spend money on your business, you should be appreciative and learn when to shut the fuck up. We aren't looking for a pity sympathetic comp. We are simply calling you out for being a straight up asshole. I tipped the server accordingly because I know it's hard to clean after kids in the restaurant.   Obviously, the owner is a brat since he wants to pick and choose who can eat at his shithole in the wall. In other negative reviews, he calls the servers he hires baffoons. What the fuck?  Parents shouldn't be limited to options because an establishment can't handle children. Anyway, the eggplant, ravioli, calzone and our server compensated the awkward dining experience. Chuck E Cheese does have better pizza and they are 10000x welcoming for kids, but we felt like wasting our time and ruining your biased ambiance.",

The small quaint little restaurant is a True experience I Got the Whole New York feel by being that it's small compact the seating area for the restaurant is smaller than the kitchen which means the guy is truly focused on putting out a quality product. I had the chicken puttanesca that was preceded by a great salad with homemade Italian dressing. Great flavors lots of olives and capers the chicken was cooked perfectly moist with a great marinara sauce shaved Parmesan on top. It was all over top of wonderful linguine that was cooked and made fresh. Giovanni stopped by to chat with me several time with his near magnum sized cabernet wine glass. He gave me a free taste of his incredible cheesecake that was the best I had in 10 years. I now have to explore the entire menu and will be back soon to do a job well done.",

My wife got the lobster and shrimp pasta dish ($17) and I was hungry after a bike ride and got the chicken parm. for dinner ($15). There is just something wonderful when you love the sauces and flavors. They came out just right. Both dishes came with a nice dark green salad and garlic bread; mine also came with a side of spaghetti. Wife's lobster and shrimp pasta had a super generous amount of big shrimp and lobster both of which were very flavorful. We left with half the food for breakfast the next day. The big $5 glass or red wine was also quite good. It's a very small restaurant with a nice quiet ambience. We will be back enthusiastically.",

Exactly what we were looking for. We ordered off the website and picked up and it was ready at the exact minute it said it would be. The gentleman in there went above and beyond welcoming us, checking our order and making small talk.   It is a little pricy and I wish there were available coupons or coupon codes. The pizza was a little greasy but delicious reminds me of my hometown NY. NY pizza is hard to find out here so I was surprised. The gluten free pizza was delicious and cooked to perfection.   The wings are a great traditional wings!! Will defiantly be back when I'm visiting again!",

They offer a string of spaghetti for 10 cents. Seems a little pricey for me but that single string was absolutely amazing well worth the 10 cents. You don't have to take my review to heart but this place is well worth a shot. If you think papa johns or Pizza Hut is good you need to take a dip into the deep end of the pizza pool and try it. We will definitely be going back again!",

I don't think it's my responsibility to heat it up more especially when I'm paying for a product that should be ready to eat.

It is the first time I've ordered from them. I had a 12\" pizza with black olives, fresh garlic, anchovies, and shrimp. Loved the garlic, but it was very strong, so consider that if your date isn't gonna eat it with you!  I choose Papa Pinney's because 1. I'd never tried them before, 2. My usual go-tos were all closed, 3. They offer shrimp as a topping, one of the few places in Las Vegas that do, and 4. I always like to try new places. I'm constantly in search of the best!  Papa Pinney's pleasantly surprised me. A True New York style pizza, with a crusty rim but soft under crust, perfect for folding; a very fresh-tasting tomato sauce, and nice, melty Italian cheeses. I put it in a 250 oven for a few minutes, box and all, when it arrived, because delivery pizza inevitably ends up being delivered lukewarm. It was delicious!  I subtracted one star for two reasons: Their smallest pizza is a 12\", way too big for two people with small appetites and smaller wallets (although I'm betting this very good pizza will be great tomorrow, too); and although I'm thankful for the shrimp, please, Papa Pinney, remove the tails from the shrimp and chop them up, so I can have a bite of shrimp with each mouthful!  A hearty recommendation for this local pizzeria. If they chop the shrimp and offer a 10\" pizza, I'll upgrade my review to five stars!",

    "text": "I was at the store next to this pizzeria to get a gift with my 3 year old baby girl for my stepdads bday when all of a sudden I hear her say, \"Mommy, I need to go bathroom.\" The store I was in did not have a public restroom so I went next door to this pizzeria where their bathroom was locked. I looked at the older woman who seemed nice that was there and said, \" I'm so sorry but my 3 year old needs to go potty.\" Where she replied, \"It's only for customers.\" So i said, \"she's only 3\" like really what harm could it have done to them? Now I understand how there are places with this policy, but I don't understand how you can say that when you see a toddler that needs to use the restroom. As I was walking out the man putting the pizza together in the background felt the need to yell \"It's only for customers\" which was not necessary since I was already walking out the door. Honestly had they let my baby girl use their bathroom I would have gladly repaid that kindness by purchasing something as a thank you..I almost mentioned it too but it all felt so wrong I could not wait to get out of there plus I didn't want my toddler to pee on herself. You will never have a customer out of me.. you may not care about that either but it's sad how people no longer have compassion... God bless you guys just the same.",

The meat lovers had a generous amount of meat and a delicious, slightly sweet sauce.  The white pizza was equally amazing, bursting with garlic.  Papa even gave us a complimentary piece of his homemade cheesecake.  This is a MUST if you eat here.  Rich and creamy, with a fresh taste from the lemon zest in the filling.  I will definitely order from here again!",

I ordered a bone in Ribeye steak cooked medium well...and OMG, absolute perfection! It came with a brandy mushroom sauce atop the steak and damn if that didn't make even that much more better. Not over powering at all, a nice sudle, but flavorful sauce. This is an off strip restaurant, but so worth the short drive off the strip to get an amazing meal for a low price. My ribeye & lobster tail dinner was ONLY $25...an easy $60 to $75 meal. Don't be surprised if the owner walks around with his extremely large wine glass that easily can hold a bottle of wine. Oh yes, the red house wine is pretty good too. A perfect pairing with red meat.",

Service was on point both times and the bottom line is that, just like the terminator, \"we'll be back.\".  Tip: restaurant seats about 32 inside only. Reservation definitely in order for large parties.  Our party of 11 had a reservation and was seated immediately on arrival at 2 reserved tables.  Had chicken alfredo fettucine with \"no salt\" for me and wife and several others tried the lobster and tenderloin special for $19.99.  I really don't know how they manage that price point, but I will take advantage as long as it is offered!    My dish was huge and prepared exactly as requested.  Pasta was perfect al dente for every pasta dish, which seldom happens.  Wife's lobster and tenderloin were cooked to perfection.  We tried a slice of the hawiian pizza another in our party ordered.  I would have chosen another, but the pizza was cooked to perfection, with toppings to the edge and the crust brown and crispy... just like I make it myself.  One in our party called the marinara a bit sweet for him.  I tasted it and I disagree.  Full tomato taste and great savory marinara taste.  On our second visit, I had the lobster and shrimp and sausage in white sauce over linguine.  Excellent is all I can say.  On our second visit, the man at the next table raved about his lasagna, which is on my radar for visit number 3.  He pointed out it was bubbling when it was served, which I love, having received so many lukewarm examples of this particular dish.  I will not bore you with other individual dish reviews.  Suffice it to say that none disappointed.  Finally, you need to try the red wine.  It is suprisingly good table wine--  not too sweet, and not too dry-- and Davo will entice you with a sample pour if you attempt to resist his friendly sales pitch.  Pro tip.  Davo pours generously.  You get 4 glasses per bottle.  Such a deal.  When we were finishing, Davo surprised us with complimentary NY style cheesecake.  So very good.   In case you haven't figured it from other reviews, the owner, Davo is the star of this show and he is entertaining, without fail.  He is originally from the Bronx and has operated 10 \"joints\" as he calls them.  I will not step on any of his many jokes and one liners.  Thera are a couple I have appropriated from him.  Davo, I haven't forgotten the cheer wood smoked salmon I promised you on our second visit.  It will hit the door in the next few days, OK?  Lastly, there is an authentic Italian piano player on the weekend. He was pretty good, but he speaks mostly Italian, so brush up!",

    "text": "The food was absolutely excellent- but believe it or not, that's not the best part of the experience. We came in from L.A. and drove across town from where we were staying because we had heard good things. There's tons of places you can get pizza in Vegas, but from now on, in my mind- there is only ONE. PAPA PINNY'S!!!  We were immediately welcomed by Kiana and Tom who were both incredibly friendly. The restaurant is charming and inviting. It's exactly what a traditional pizzeria should be. We hit them up on a Monday night not during peak hours, so they weren't busy- but that may have been the best timing ever.   We ordered garlic knots and a supreme pizza. After we ordered, Kiana came out to offer us some complimentary wine. Shortly after that, Papa Pinny himself came out to introduce himself to us and talk with us about our experience. He also offered us some complimentary wine. Did I mention that he brought us out some complimentary garlic bread? Delicious garlic bread. Some of the best garlic bread I've ever had.   Really cool to watch a hand-tossed pizza being made like a True artist like Tom! And the pizza was delicious. Perfect mix of sauce and toppings. Loved it.   Like I said- the food is outstanding, but not even the best part of the experience. The best part is the people. Everyone was so incredibly kind and friendly. Tom and Papa Pinny kept coming over to visit. And there was a nice gentleman there named Scott. We talked a lot. We talked about hockey. We talked about Los Angeles and Vegas and Hughes Aircraft and you can tell- these people care about their customers. And it wasn't phony. These people are just genuinely cool, kind people. How often do you walk out of a pizza place feeling loved and respected? How often do you walk out of a pizza place feeling like you've made new friends? Feeling like family.  Papa Pinny has a guest book for everyone to sign. We were glad to sign it. And at one point, Papa came to take a picture with the family. We were told they were collecting photos of happy customers to put up on the wall at some point.   Long story short: I can't say enough good things about this place. And we love the people. We will be back. I can't wait to come back.  And maybe next time we'll take the challenge of the massive square cut pizza they offer!  God Bless Papa Pinny, Tom, Kiana and Scott and everyone there! TRY THIS PLACE!",

They are amazing musicians that you can't help but move to their music. Just loud enough you could have a comfortable conversation but not feel like you're a part of everyone's conversations. What a great find! Thin crust pizza that stayed crisp and the flavors complemented each other. It was so delicious! We waited a bit for our pizza but that's to be expected with freshly made food but again the live music made the wait feel more like a show. To finish it off we ordered the strawberry cheesecake made from scratch by Giovanni. Delicious!!!! The service was so friendly and attentive! This is an experience and a must try!",

    "text": "Craving pizza and not able to leave my house, I called in an order for delivery one weekday afternoon. The lady who answered the phone and took my order was very sweet. I ordered a house salad with house Italian dressing, and a pepperoni and mushroom calzone. Total with tax and tip was $27. A bit pricey for a meal for one in my opinion. She quoted me 45 mins for delivery and the delivery time was spot on, if not few mins early.   The calzone was pretty good. It was stuffed with delicious ricotta and mozzarella cheese, and I got pepperoni and Mushrooms as toppings. The zone came with a side of marinara sauce which was tasty. The house salad had spring mix, black olives, garbanzo and kidney beans and mozzarella cheese. The Italian dressing was very good, definitely house made. This wasn't anything that I need to have again ASAP, but I'd be inclined to order the salad again for that yummy Italian dressing.",

Your business response makes me sure that I will never be returning to your establishment. On top of the pizza being thick, it was gross. I tried to call your restaurant the next day, and it was closed, otherwise I would've dropped what you describe as \"pizza\" off. Your server even explained to me that the cook was new. It was a half-and-half pizza, nothing crazy off the menu and it still was done incorrectly and, instead of your restaurant taking fault, you blame me for being incoherent when clearly the server understood me if my pizza was the correct half-and-half but just thick and gross. \"INCOHERENT\"??! Puh-lease. I have plenty of degrees that say otherwise.",

Victor, our waiter (who could have a future as a comedian and exuded the best happy attitude) greeted us and got us settled in no time with the delicious house wine served in very generous glasses. The complimentary garlic bread was amazing, we had salads, pasta, pizza, and dessert and every item was amazing. The owner was super friendly, checked on us a couple of times, and when we were about to leave another staff member offered to carry our pizza box etc to our cars. Now a days you don't see this type of genuine attention and service often at all. The place, the live music, the staff, and the food get an A+ from me. Great job!",

The waitress went to the back 5 times over 40 minutes.  Her explanation was he said they'll get them when they get them. Really nasty experience and we don't know why. RIDICULOUS!! The waitress did apologize and said she would let the owner know but doesn't do anything for me",

Our first go-to was Yelp, then Google Maps and after a few wrong turns we finally found ourselves here.  I prefer to call it \"Giovanni's Gem In the Wall\". As soon as we opened the door and heard Sandor's lovely violin, everything just went up from there.  Seth our great server, Giovanni the owner....oh and the food!  Did I mention the food?  It's superb!",

    "text": "What a find!!!!! Saw there were new owners so decided to give it another go and so glad we did! What drew me to this place was the $19.99 Filet and Lobster special but what we ended up having was just as divine!  Davo the owner took the time to come over, introduce himself and chat with us with his HUGE glass of Dego-Red in hand. We found out through conversation the lovely lady who greeted us was his wife who was also very welcoming. Ordered the Antipasto, Caprese, Spaghetti and Meatballs (BIG), Cheese Ravioli, homemade cheesecake and homemade tiramisu accompanied by a delicious House Red blend. Total bill: $80 The antipasto was huge with a great selection of quality meats and cheeses, the caprese made with heirloom tomatoes topped with a creamy buffalo mozzarella and a nice balsamic glaze. The spaghetti and meatballs-my Dad could eat this dish morning, noon and night and every time we've gone out for Italian-the dish always falls short even at some of the 5 star restaurants here in Vegas. BUT NOT THIS TIME!!! He's eyes actually LIT up when he tasted the sauce! \"THIS\" he said \"IS HOW YOU MAKE SPAGHETTI!\" I too loved the sauce-great consistency, slightly sweet and all essence of the tomato-not your typical overly seasoned too thick wall paper paste or the ragu type sauce...perfect balance! The meatballs-homemade, huge and free of fillings other than what should be in a meatball. The raviolis were filled with a very creamy cheese that melted in your mouth. The portions...definitely enough to split and satisfy 2 people. Even though we were filled to the brim; we couldn't pass up the cheesecake and tiramisu which were D-Lish!!! Also, there's a nice keyboardist who plays at a perfect level of sound who complements the quaint decor and welcoming atmosphere. Great things come in small packages and this one delivered!!!!  Can't recommend here enough; whether for a date, family dinner or a few friends coming together for good conversation and food-this will become your new spot! It's become ours!",

The owners and all of the staff really care about their customers and making sure everyone has an amazing experience at Giovanni's hole in the wall!

Total bargain for what you get. *might not always be available... I don't know*  My personal bias is against loud TVs in restaurants; but in a pizza place, I can let that slide. I frequently do some work in this little strip of shops. Papa Pinny's is certainly going to become  regular lunch place for me.",

Both dishes were great and the entrees are huge.
