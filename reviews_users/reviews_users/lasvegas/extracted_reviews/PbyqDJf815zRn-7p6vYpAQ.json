This establishment still rates high on the suck-o-meter.  2000mg glutamate-ridden burgers.  Fries that even Ronald does better. And what is this? No milkshakes?!?!  What kind of burger place doesn't offer a milkshake? Ah they have pre-packaged ice cream sandwiches from CoolHaus though, come on!  Here is why Umami gets one star instead of none...because I can use their outside entrance to gain access to the SLS quicker.  Milkshake, figure it out...it's ice cream, milk...and a god damn blender.",

We had their Manly burger, which had house beer cheddar, bacon lardons, smoked salt onion strings, ketchup and mustard. Burger was mediocre. First, it came out lukewarm. Second, the burger tasted like it was previously frozen with no flavor. Thirdly, for $13 it was small and unimpressive. We also had their fries, which I thought were pretty good. Almost McDonald's like but still decent. But, again, $5 for them was fairly steep.",

There's something about the food though, it doesn't taste the same as other locations. Granted, I haven't been here since they opened, so maybe I need to see how it is now. I expected this place to be a regular spot I'd frequent, but the first visit just didn't wow me enough to come back. Our server was great, but he actually wasn't a permanent employee here, they were still sorting out staffing at the SLS and one the hotel's departments had workers that were placed here. You could kind of see confusion though with the other servers at other tables. Our burgers, fries and dessert just weren't as good as I remember the SF location being (I even took the day off of work to make the venture into deep SF to indulge)... and it just didn't.. umami. I think anyone who hasn't gone to previous locations though will like this place well enough. The SLS itself is all kinds of blah, so that probably has something to do with my overall aversion to coming back. Vegas has a ton of burger options and this place needs to step it up if it's going to survive (which I really hope it does, Vegas economy doesn't need another hotel closing).",

The Truffle cheese on the fries were just right and the burger was cooked to a medium rare perfection. I definitely recommend Umami Burger!!",

I get it, it's a sports bar but I think Umami could have been as successful if they kept their modern design vs. the \"Man Cave\" vibe.   The pickle platter was bomb!   I love funky flavors and each item brought a flavorful kick to my palette.  The pickles were very craveable. My husband and I shared a burger, hot dog, and onion rings.  Onion rings are good but eat quickly or else you will see a pool of grease.  The other thing different at this location is the lack of homemade ketchup.  We received regular ketchup in a squeeze bottle and not the brownish red homemade stuff that we are used to. I would definitely go back and recommend it!",

Random people sitting around watching sports at tables, maybe 30 people in the place, 10 might be ordering food. Random servers walking around talking to each other and sometimes some people sitting around get a menu. I came in to bet and maybe get some food.  So this happened both times. Sat around watching a game for about 30 minutes. Asked for a menu from one of the servers that seemed to be just randomly walking around. Got one after a while. Then waited for someone to take my order, oh for about 45 minutes? This last time I just left.  Food is pretty good actually. Burgers are juicy, chicken wings are tasty and prices are just fine. Just whoever manages the place obviously has no clue what they are doing. Just managers and servers walking around, looking around with no organization or idea of what's going on. 2 stars still because of the food, sportsbook and nice TVs, but they are gonna close up..I mean, that's easy to see after about 10 minutes in the place.",

The seating itself is a bit wacky, as it's combined with a sports book and outdoor area, so make sure you get there at the right time if it's Sunday or Monday night. People are staying at those tables for a loooong time. Items ordered.. Buffalo chicken loaded \"potato nachos\" - chips with cheese and chinks of buffalo chicken on it. Hard to get a piece of chicken onto the chip. Finger food time!  Black bean burger (chipotle black bean patty, Cotija cheese, guacamole, street-cart pickles, cilantro) - Very, very average. On the dry side and quick to crumble.  Truffle fries - Good fries, with or without the truffle cheese. Came with three dipping sauces which were all unmemorable.  Beers- not a huge selection but some nice stuff. Check their webpage for drink specials.   Bonus: There's a good manager in the house and the truffle fries are comp'd with Yelp check-in",

Mind you I had already spent $40 and my father in law $60.  This made no since, until a party of 8 women sat next to us, then she was elated to serve them, even though they had not played any of the bar machines.  I guess \"Natalia\" only serves those who order directly from the bar.  Not good for locals trying to show relatives a good time.  Thank you \"Natalia\"",

Some claim \"double patties\" but it's really just the single patty cut in half. With a group of 6 people, the waitress tacked on a 20% gratuity tip without informing us, and the receipt still had a place to fill in an additional tip. I would say 20% or more is what we usually tip for decent service, but our service was pretty subpar. The waitress came by to take or order, and drop off the check. Busboy brought food and drinks. When the waitress was asked almost anything, she was very attitudinal with us for no reason. Not worth 20%. They don't have a basic burger for, say, a ten year old. Instead of informing us the cheapest option is to take a couple things off a fancier burger to make something simple, they wanted to charge us per topping. Good thing I asked before she put our order in - got the same burger for dollars cheaper! Probably will not go back.",

I ordered the Truffle Burger Royal (the one with the egg on top), the sweet potato fries, and the pickle platter.  Everything was just the right size, not too small, and not too large where you feel like death afterwords.  The fries were a little cold, but delicious. Really delicious.  Plus the temperature was totally forgivable, given the fact that I was able to enjoy them in the privacy of my hotel room.  I found the burger to be something truly special, and would order it over, and over again if I could.  The meat was perfectly cooked, the egg was perfectly runny, and the compilation of ingredients was quite spectacular.  The only reason I can't give Umami Burger 5 stars, is because much like other people, I found the ketchup to be pretty gross.  I don't understand the reason for that exact recipe, or consistency, but I felt like it actually took away from the meal, rather than added to it. I'm a pretty big stickler for ketchup, so I really hope they decide to go another route.",

I had the umami standard burger. overall the burger was not juicy, rather dry.   could not find the mushroom that was supposed to be on the burger.  the sauce was really ketchup,  the sweet potatoes were undercooked.  had the dessert of warm cookie with ice cream.  if by warm it meant room tempature, well it met expectations.  the ice cream tasted like ice cream you get when you buy 5 gallons for a dollar.  too wast of money 3.  speaking of money, this place is way overpriced.  take an uber and go somewhere else, it may end up costing the same but the quality would likely be better.   4.  if you are a nonsmoker, you get the enjoy inhaling smoke. 5.  lots of tvs but you only get to watch the games they want on the tv.  i asked to have a specific game on the tv that is situated inside my booth. \"we will see what we can do\"  nothing was done.",

Pros: the meat in the burgers is really well cooked and super juicy. The beer cheese on the manly fries is superb. I also really liked the sweetness of the Umami ketchup.   Cons: too much bun in top and not enough on the bottom. The buns get really really soggy. The fries also get pretty soggy from all the sauce they put on them.   Flavored were very good, but in all aspects I have had better. It's a solid restaurant though. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly and food came out quickly. I'm just not crazy about any if that food.",

    "text": "I really want to give this  place 4 stars but I just can't. When we arrived and said we wanted to watch football, eat and drink, we were told if we sat inside it was a minimum of $50 per person. Wait, what? Outside there was no minimum. Being a gorgeous  Vegas day, the choice was obvious. Outside was a pleasant roomy space with many TVs. All the games were on, and our server was super nice. She was so nice that I really don't want this review to reflect on her. Now here's where the stars go down. Apparently there were some flies around (um it's outside) and so they turned on some fans to dispel them. Normally that would be fine, but these were super turbo fans( seriously it sounded like we were next to a jet airplane) and we couldn't hear  the games or each other. They did turn the one over us off after we said something.  I did enjoy the truffle beet salad and the ahi burger was very good( and very messy), but our orders took forever and were sometimes forgot. I'm not sure who dropped the ball but they do need to work on these problems.  After getting the bill it was very obvious we were on the strip. We could have sat inside after all. Will we come back??? Unfortunately, I just can't say for sure.",

I wasn't sure if went with something specific or if it was just for the table or etc.    My burger was delicious. I added one of the spicy sauces and that made it that much better. The pretzel was the biggest one I have ever seen. It was really good. Soft, fluffy and Perfect. I also really liked the fried oysters - it had a really great flavor.

I think the GPS inside CC is kinda off... but anyways, we trekked our way to SLS to eat some burgers. If you enter through the Las Vegas Blvd entrance, just walk to your left and you'll see Umami quickly.  Got our seats and table quickly and our server came over and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. Water please! And he left us to go get us water while we looked at the menu.   I ended up getting the manly burger: manly $12.95  House beer-cheddar, bacon lardons, smoked-salt onion strings, Umami house ketchup, mustard spread.  and they also have a Yelp Check in offer, of free fries or a draft beer if I recall correctly, as we opted for the fries.  The server came by regularly to refill our water, but all our attentions were to the many TVs that lined the Umami \"walls\" (they're not really walls, as you can still see and feel casino of SLS outside). They even have a personal TV for each table. However, I do not know if you can change the channel of the TV next to you.  Manly burger- Onion strings. After taking a few pictures and enjoying the mix of bacon on medium meat, along with the addition of ketchup and the mustard, you feel manlier. Just kidding. It's mostly because of the bacon and onion strings, along with the flavor you get with everything else that makes it come at ya ;) Tasty but I don't know.. $12.95? :/   Their truffle fries were heavy but amazing. It did not make me sick like the ones in the Irvine Spectrum did. It's a good amount for two people to share (so make sure you don't get too many if you have the Yelp check in offer).  Service is attentive. Even with the college football game of the week going on, the server came to us and asked if we had everything, if we needed anything else, etc.  Maybe I'll try Umami again in Socal, because of the LV location~",

Perhaps, it may have been my fault that I got a Turkey burger over a Cow burger.....but nonetheless I still got a burger.   Turkey burger: 2.5/5- The buns were fluffy and soft. I do have to admit that I thoroughly enjoy a great burger when the buns are fresh. I hate stale buns, what's the point of that. Secondly, I was mildly obsessed with the fact that my burger had sprouts on it. Double points. Thirdly, this is where I couldn't do it anymore. This green salty sauce was horrible. It overpowered the burger and it was extremely salty for my palate. UGH!  Truffle Fries: 3/5- I could go on about these. I love cheese on my fries and even better truffle oil. I must say that the truffle oil was a little bit on the lighter side, but the cheese made up for it.   Sweet Potato Fries: 2/5- Why is their sugar on these? You may want to let patrons know that it is covered in sugar. I was thoroughly saddened by the sugar on these fries.....  Poke: 2/5- My fault for ordering poke at a burger place. It just sounded good at the time. Too much sauce that covered the poke. Not the best poke ever.....",

    "text": "What does Umami mean? Since I have never been there I googled it and this was the best answer.  Umami is a basic taste like sweet, sour or bitter. Umami comes from glutamic acid, which is an amino acid - a form of protein. It gives food a \"hearty\" or \"meaty\" taste to it. There are specific taste buds on the tongue to pick up on it.   So after reading this, it only made me want to go there even more. As luck would have it, the Umami Burger that is located inside of SLS was the designated restaurant for Social Sundays that day. It is an event every sunday where a particular restaurant takes 50 percent off its menu prices.   So me and two other buddies meet up there around 8:30. I was kind of surprised the place was not that busy given the fact that it was social sunday. Im thinking great service should ge a given.  Since it was my first time, I went with their namesake, the Umami Burger also known as the \"Original\" ($12.00) and an order of Tempura Onion Rings ($5.00). My buddies both got the Sunny Side also known as the \"Truffle Especiale\" ($14). They also opted for Korean Fries ($6.00) and Truffle Fries ($5.50). Note: These prices are what is in the menu so what we paid was half of what you see.  The Umami Burger has parmesan frico, shittake mushroom, roasted tomato, carmelized onions and Umami house ketchup. After the first bite I knew that I had picked the right burger. Definitely lots of flavor. The beef patty was very juicy and from the looks and taste of it, it was cooked medium. This burger might just end up being my usual.  The Tempura Battered Onion Rings had the nice crispiness to it just like how tempura is supposed to be. You can tell that it was cooked fresh and not frozen simply because the onion itself was still semi crispy. They cooked it just right.  The Korean Fries were sweet potato fries topped off with kimchi, scallions, goat cheese, and Korean ketchup. The sweet potato fries by themselves were already good but when you eat one that has the above mentioned toppings on it look out! It had a bit of a kick to it but very tolerable.  The Truffle Fries were shoe string fries smothered with melted truffle cheese. Nice flavor combination of crunch and seasoning of the truffle cheese.  Im glad we shared all three sides because we would of never gotten to taste the variety of each plate. Im assuming that their Maple Bacon Fries were really popular because that was the first thing we wanted to order but our said they ran out of maple syrup.  As for the service, eh, it had great potential when we first got there seeing that the place was not that busy. Our server took our orders and got them to us in a timely manner. Now thats where the service pretty much stopped. We didnt see our server for quite sometime and ended up flagging down another server just so we could get refills on our waters and sodas. One of my friends had already used up most of his napkin to so he asked for another one but never got it.  So overall, the fact that it it was 50 percent off and everything we ordered was delicious, that deserves 5 stars. But the lack of service after receiving our food kind of ruined my experience. So 1 star for bad service and 5 stars for great food which was half off. So there's your ok rating of 3 stars. Im hoping that the bad service was just a fluke and that my next visit will be better. If it is then I will update this accordingly.  Yelp 2015 Review #26 524 overall",

    "text": "My husband and I were fed up with the overpriced dining options available at the Las Vegas Convention Center during the Wizard World Comic Con, so we opted to dine at SLS instead and ended up choosing Unami Burger for our dinner spot. According to the online menu, there's a black bean burger available. The menu lies. There was, however, a vegetarian \"burger\" option that was pointed out to me by the hostess. Salvation!  SLOPPY MAMI ($12): I'd best describe this as a vegetarian sloppy joe. The burger was topped with tasty lentils (so tasty it made me wonder why I'm not including more lentils in my diet), a fried onion \"haystack\" (I hate onions but actually liked these), and slithers of jalapenos. Melted cheese held everything together. I was impressed with this Sloppy Mami. The downsides? Not enough jalapeno and it comes a la carte. 4/5   THIN FRIES ($4): You simply cannot eat a burger without a side of fries. Thumbs up for these fries! 4/5  BEEF NACHOS ($10): I loved that the nachos came with a side dish of salsa. Who does that?? No one, that's who. My husband super duper liked this dish. 4/5  SERVICE: The food came out within 7 minutes of ordering, but service was intermittent. There's room for improvement. 3/5   VIBE: The layout is kind of weird since the SLS Sports Book is inside Unami. Weird, I know. There's Unami diners, and then there's people lounging on sofas watching sports on TV. The restaurant was pretty rambunctious, noise wise.     Worth a Return Visit? I'm hoping to come back on Social Sundays to score a 50% discount!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #96",

She surprised us with an item from Umami's secret menu. I don't remember what it was, but it was some sort of cheesy goodness! The outside seething was a great idea, it was bright, sunny with a cool wind. The ambience is relaxed, the food and drinks were good.

    "text": "The atmosphere here is a little different than the usual Umami at the LA locations and I honestly didn't mind that all. It's a little sports barsy compared to the intimate/trendy vibe of the other locations. I have been to several Umami's and the U-mini (cheaper but still as tasty spinoff of Umami) in Westwood and I think consistency in their food has always been key at their restaurants. Their menu is exactly the same as the California locations as well.   Loved that we got seated at a massive booth right away, service was so also pretty good and our server took our orders right away.  We did get our waters right away.. However, we probably waited for about 20 minutes for our burgers to come out. It was a Thursday night and the restaurant was not packed at all.   -Truffle fries were on point, and the server did give me the options for all the sauces (pretty standard) - Truffle burger was great but I think is a little overpriced  - Manly burger was also pretty good with the lardons and the onion rings however it is again, a little overpriced imo..  Umami has really got the flavor of the burgers down but size has always been an issue for me. I've always thought their burgers are a little too tiny for 15 bucks.. and it does leave me a little hungry still after.. I may be a petite Asian girl, but I can sure down a huge ass burger when I want to.",

We stopped at the Las Vegas location after 6 hours of driving on our way back from the Grand Canyon to Southern California. I was ravenous. I ordered the truffle burger (added roasted tomatoes) and we split truffle fries (blahhhhhh give me my own fries people! Friends who ask to split fries are bad food friends). NOM NOM NOM! I was a happy camper. I do not know if it is the best burger I have ever eaten but it definitely ranks up there in the top. Truffle. Brioche. Meat. Fries. More Truffle...need I say more?",

    "text": "I've had the original Umami location in LA bookmarked for the longest time, and for whatever reason, we've just never had time to make it there when we're in town. So, when we booked our room for SLS, we knew Umami was definitely going to be one of our meals!  This location inside the SLS is quite large. Not only is it a full service restaurant, but it's also houses the casinos sports book and a beer garden. There's quite a bit of seating throughout the location, but the way it's set up is weird and there seems to be no real uniformity. Alongside seating at the indoor bar, there's small tables, high-tops, and couches for the sports book. Then when you walk outside, you've got more picnic table style seating, and another fairly large bar that's got to be a good 50+ feet long. There's just a lot going on and depending on where you sit, you may not be able to order food or just sit down to enjoy a drink while watching the games. If you are coming strictly for the food though, they do offer text notifications so you can go gamble or do whatever while waiting for a table.  Looking online, it seems like the menu is pretty much the same as at other locations, and there's a good amount of options too. If you're not feeling a burger, they have salads, \"Un-Beef\" sandwiches and even sausages. The sides are pretty typical for a burger joint and the fries can be customized in a handful of ways. There's 8 burgers to choose from and this Umami is no different from the others as their infamous no substitution rule is in full-effect. Although, they will let you request a different cooking temperature for the meat. Standard cooking temp is medium rare, just so ya know.  We decided on an order of fried pickles to share, and I opted for the Truffle Especiale burger. Oddly enough, after receiving the order, our waitress told us that she wasn't a huge fan of the fried pickles. I couldn't disagree with her more as they were definitely some of the better I've had. The batter was thick, crunchy, flavorful and stuck to the pickle completely. It never fell apart and I liked that the pickle inside wasn't so hot that you couldn't eat it. Adding to the flavor was a nice side of jalapeno ranch that was creamy with just a touch of heat.  Although a bit on the small side, my burger was equally impressive. If you're a fan of truffle, Umami does not disappoint! Topped with both truffle butter and truffle arugula, the flavor is immediately present without being overpowering. The arugula still had a nice crisp texture to it, and it coupled perfectly with the fried egg. Now, these guys are proud of their beef too...and rightfully so! The meat isn't smashed down like meatloaf and on it's own has hints of both sweet and salty flavors. It was juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare.   With all the commotion going around on their first day, I admittedly expected less than stellar service. That was far from the case and I thought the service was excellent. Apart from her expressing her hatred for the fried pickles, after we ordered them, our waitress was extremely friendly and even a little funny too. I appreciate that she knew the menu well and didn't hesitate to answer a single question. And not only was she on her game, but other servers were checking on us and every other table to make sure drinks were full, etc. The team work and overall ambience was just great!  For a burger joint, the overall prices aren't horrible, but they aren't great either. My burger was $14 and even though I think this was more of a casino thing, I was pretty irritated about paying $5 for a soda. For 2 burgers, 2 drinks and a side, our bill was $55 with tip. I'm also not a huge fan of having all that stuff packed into one location. But the food and service were both very good and I definitely see myself coming back!",

While the server we had was amazing, when we originally arrived we wanted to sit outside, when we were rapidly approached by a \"harsh\" waitress that told us that if we wanted to sit outside we could, but we would have to go order our food and drinks inside ourselves and basically we weren't going to have service. Sooo we look around and there were at least another 4 tables outside with people eating and drinking. So we don't know what was that about, we went back inside and got a table there, so we get the menu, husband and son order beers from their menu and they were not available, so they pick a second choice and once again they were not available, were we not at a bar that specializes in beer and burgers? Anyhoo the server made it up by offering something similar to what was originally requested. Burgers were great but the french fries and the sweet potato fries were seasoned great, but they were cold. Overall it was just a weird experience. This was our second time here, first time we were impressed with the overall experience, that's why we went back. This time was a disappointment.",

A couple yrs ago I used to eat the turkey burger at Umami in Costa Mesa on the regular. It was so good I would order two! They used very good quality turkey, I think it was from Diestel farms iirc. Then they started changing it about a year ago so I quit going. This turkey patty they are serving now tasted like processed crap that I remember from the cafeteria in elementary school. I really wish they would go back to using high quality ingredients. I hate it when chains expand quickly and start focussing solely on increasing profits. Customers do notice the difference. The truffle fries were the only good thing we had here. My bro got the Manly Burger and he said it was just ok. The chicken wings tasted old.",

The other half of our party got their food (that we had ordered at the same time) and were over half finished before our boxes were brought out.  The food was cold when we got it and despite my mom telling the waitress the checks would be separate ahead of time she only brought one check.

Leave your name & # w the hostess, get your gambling on, & they'll txt you when the table's ready.   Cocktails are $13. The mule that I ordered was alright. Seeing that it was opening day, I'm sure the kinks will be tweaked out.   Ordered the Royale ($15). Consisted of braised short rib, truffle aioli & truffle cheese on a med-rare burg. Taste and consistency were pretty on point from my usual go-to locations here in LA. Never had the short rib before so that was a nice tasty addition. Sweet potato fries ($4) were good as well. They had all the sauces displayed out on a plate per usual w the small pho spoons.   Service was good. Each booth has a tv that in the future, you'll be able to request a channel change for a certain game I'm sure. Layout of the place is nice. Very open w a lot of tv's & a small lounge area in the middle of the restaurant that reminded me that there's an actual sports book in the restaurant.   **PSA*** NO tots for at least a week!! Was very sad to find that out when I was there. Reason given from the waiter was that the training of the cooking staff had to be perfected before \"secret menu\" items were brought out. That also means no burger special for a while too.   Overall, it's your usual Umami burger restaurant w the sports book addition. Great burgers w a lot of other menu options as well. If you can't get to LA or NYC, this location will def get the job done for the Umami fix. ENJOY!!",

It's loud and exciting, but not too busy..The place was organized, but the tables in the middle are TOO close together. We might as well have just pushed our tables together with strangers because it was basically like we were talking to each other. Someone please space the tables away from each other!!!!   Service: 3 - Our server was sweet, but the service was great and fast in the beginning...but very, very slow at the end. Not too fun to be waiting 20-25 minutes just for the check! And there wasn't even that many people around.   Food: 3 - Food was just okay. I got the Truffle Burger, Truffle Fries, and Onion Rings. It's a little sad and disappointing for me to announce that the best thing I ate was the onion rings..and maybe the sauces on the side they gave to us.   I did not like how the truffle burger was just --drenched-- in truffle sauce. It made my entire meal soggy, and that's just not what a burger is about for me. I think if they go easier on the truffle sauce around here, people might like it better because it WAS actually a juicy and well-cooked burger.   The truffle fries were way too salty. We had to constantly wipe salt off of ours. The truffle sauce and cheese that's on it is already pretty salty! Hopefully they will be subtle next time with that seasoning!   When I had wine tasting classes, they taught us that umami was a balance of the tastes on your tongue. Yet, everything was either too salty or too soggy. Find a balance, and you'll get better reviews!",

    "text": "My favorite burger in the world!!! I always order the truffle burger medium rare! It's the perfect blend of sweet, savory, saltiness, juiciness, umami, and texture. This is the second day in a row coming and I'm ordering the exact same thing again!! It's just tooooo good. I've had billionaire burgers at Holsteins, shake shack, bachi burger, and a few other gourmet burgers, but the truffle burger at umami burger is by far my favorite!!  Little tip: don't ruin the burger with adding additional sauces like ketchup or mayo. Just have it the way it comes from the kitchen. Guaranteed to amaze!!! Also thanks Carlos for being such a dope server!",

    "text": "Booked a booth and table here for Superbowl Sunday. 130 a person included a $20 food credit PP, open bar and the kicker... a nice comfy booth. I forget the hosts name, but big thanks to her as she dialed in our booth and table right next to each other. Also sat us right in front of the video wall which was great for the game.  Positives: - Lots of TVs - Solid Food - Good service (Wish I remember her name, but we did take care of her on top of the auto gratuity) - Sportsbook in the restaurant, which was great for mid game betting  Cons: - Location of the SLS in general. It's a bit off the beaten path - Umami Burger was fine, but walking into the Casino reminded me of some weird mashup of trendy LA and Fremont street. - Some interesting characters walking around the casino (and by interesting I mean sketchy as fuck). Security needs to be improved. - The DDR-esque lightup entrance to the casino was severely tacky and slightly depressing   Side Notes: - Had 800 Degrees Pizza after the game and it was delicious - Needs improvement overall on the casino front, but SBE knows whats up when it comes to restaurants",

I seriously cannot remember eating a burger that delicious! The only downsize is the burger is a little on the small side, so if you're really hungry, it will not be enough. And for the price and size, the burgers do not come with fries or anything. I did order the Truffle Fries on the side which were also pretty good. Their fried pickles was okay. The pickles are huge spears, which is hard to share, would be better if they were cut smaller like in slices. Onion rings were good too, the batter was pretty tasty.  The service could have been better. Our server kinda had an attitude problem so we weren't thrilled with that, Honestly though, the food was pretty damn amazing. If the burger was a little bigger than a kids meal size and came with fries I would totally give it 5 stars! So because of that, I will give 4.",

So I stopped at the sports book to place a bet and to look at the Umami menu. I sat down in one of the couches and the first person that approach me was one of the managers. Super friendly and he had great recommendations, his beer knowledge was impressive, he suggested the Hawaiian beers on draft and he brought some samples over. My server was also great and the food amazing. I can't wait to comeback for football season.",

We were given the option on sitting inside or outside and our hostess recommended that we sit outside since they had multiple televisions. We were seated very quickly. It took about maybe 10 minutes for them to ask what we would even like to drink, it wasn't even crowded either. Unacceptable. Took about another 10 minutes to actually get the waters and order our food. So all in all it took 20 minutes to place our order, crazy.  We both ordered the royale burger and my friend got the sweet potato fries while I got the truffle fries. The food was brought out in a timely manner, surprisingly! They bring out 3 different selection of sauces that were phenomenal. The royale burger was pretty tasty but I do like the truffle burger a little better. The truffle fries never disappoint and the sweet potato fries were good, but nothing mind blowing.  When we got the check we instantly paid and left. The meal was very pleasant just like California locations, just kinda wish the customer service was up to par like the other ones. I will be back in the future with the hope that the service will be better.",

We get some weird mix of juice mixers from the bar for our son because there aren't any drinks for kids (and that's OK really - we know it's Vegas). My son spills half the juice right away on himself and the booth and I use the napkins on the table to wipe it up. We never got new napkins, even after we asked. Server didn't seem to notice us frantically sopping up the spill on our kid. My wife was skeptical of the cheese sauce on the Hatch burger and asked for it on the side so she could try it out. This apparently annoyed the server. I got the Umami burger. We got sweet potato fries for our son. Food comes and my wife's burger is wrong - sauce and aioli on it which she wanted on the side. My burger is completely wrong - some other item entirely. We have no napkins and never received silver ware when we were seated. Had to ask for it. Our server proceeded to avoid our table for the rest of the night and help other tables around us. Various other servers and bus boys handled our requests for the right order, silverware, napkins, ketchup, etc. Food was pretty underwhelming. Hatch chilis had no heat or flavor. The burgers were nicely cooked and meat tasted good but otherwise it's just a heavy, fall-apart meal. Server finally comes back and we ask for the bill. Twenty minutes pass and we have asked a bus boy who bussed our table to get our server to bring the bill as well as another server who walked by. We ended up walking to the bar to pay. This might be the worst service I've ever had. Restaurant was pretty empty too, so it looks like everyone else knows to avoid this place as well.",

It seems that they have a really good filtration system as we couldn't smell much smoke compared to other casinos. It could be that there was just not a lot of people smoking there. Now, down to business. I ordered the impossible burger. The cost was really high. It was about $18 just for the burger. The side of fries was another $8 or so. I did get truffle fries which were delicious. The burger was really tasty and it came with two patties. I also ordered a lemonade which was $4. My girlfriend got a salad and a beer. The salad was around $12 and a beer was $13. I would come back here but not often since it costs so much. But on a special occasions or to treat myself. Parking is complementary which is nice and I did like the ambience. Your options were sit in a booth, a table with chairs or you could sit on couches which is what we did. Our waitress was really attentive and anticipated our needs. Excellent customer service! I did enjoy my plant-based burger which tasted very good , the only issue I may have with the burger and the fries is that it is a bit more on the sa side then I'd like it to be. But it was still tasty.",

    "text": "Umami burgers are amazing, they are cooked well and have amazing flavor. If, you like Umami type food.   The fries and other appetizers are good, but truthfully, the burgers are what make the trip worthwhile. Though everyone likes the truffle fries.   And if you're a fan of Vegan, their Impossible Burger is second to none.   A little more pricey than the usual burger fare, but the quality is usually worth it.   Great beer garden too, when the weather cools down it will be fun and packed and the best option on the north side of the strip (before downtown Freemont, that is).",

This is my second visit here (staying at SLS), and this food is so mediocre - my husband described it as \"even deader cow\". The buns were cold and stale, the roasted tomatoes on my umami burger were cold, the burger as a whole came across as a pale comparison to the original Umami Burger, and even to this location from 2 years ago. Meh, disappointing. However, our server was attentive and the reason for 2 more stars (she deserves 5 stars). Food/energy/cost wise, there are so many more options in Vegas in general.",

On top of that the service is sub par.  The staff caters to the bar, and drink orders, took a long time for our food to arrive, and the culture of the place is definitely Rude.  I don't know if it's the Smokey casino environment, or having to manage a full bar on top of the food.     The burger wasn't cooked rite, and the sauces seemed old, or off I guess would be the best way to say it.   In general I would say soft PASS on Unami, they just don't impress. Definitely will try somewhere new next time I'm feeling a burger.",

The waitress, I believe her name is Casey was very nice and attentive. Food was good, drinks were on point.Is it like this everyday? Probably not, but be realistic about what you are saying of this location. Most of us that come to Las Vegas is to get away from our reality, have fun, perhaps do new things, pretty much experience something different from our norm. Most of the reviews are correct in a few things like its a sport bar, hundred percent correct. Every food joint is completely different from each other, so don't expect that the wings here are going to top Buffalo Wild Wings or the hamburger is going to top In n Out. We all have a preference, be open minded. Come check them out and be a judge yourself. If you don't like them, great! get some cardio in and walk to In and Out or go the very well known, commercial food joints and enjoy. If you like them, now you know where to come next time.",

    "text": "I went to an Umami Burger in LA and now I've tried the SLS Hotel Umami Burger in Las Vegas. Great burgers! Totally different vibes! The one in LA didn't have the sports bar component. The Umami in Vegas is located next to the casino of the SLS Hotel. Right beside Katsuya restaurant. Very close distance to the monorail entrance.  The truffle burger was just awesome! I loved the touch of the charred U placed on the top bun. The meat was tender. Branded burger! My mom loved the ahi poke burger.  We split the two burgers in half so we could try both. She took a few bites of the truffle burger and wanted the ahi half back! And I wanted my truffle burger half back as well!  My truffle fries are totally delish! The fries were super thin with some cheese and garnish on top. Very easy to eat. On the other hand, the sweet potato fries were so sweet they should've been dessert! I felt they were overly coated with cinnamon sugar. We actually treated these fries as a dessert at the end of the meal. I found the fries reminded me of the Filipino dessert kamote cue (deep fried caramelized sweet potato).  The service was quick and pleasant. I felt the prices were a little expensive but it is Vegas after all. I ended up spending about $50 for myself and my mom. At the end of the meal the waitress said a new menu was debuting that day! She encouraged us to come back. Next time I'm in Vegas I definitely will!",

    "text": "I saw via a post from both Alton Brown and Umami Burger about a special collab burger and I wanted to try it so I go on down and then the server informs me they don't have specials after I mention the Alton burger. The reason I came is not there, disappointed I don't wanna feel like I wasted my time so I order their truffle burger and simple fries. Didn't take as long as I thought it would.  The patty was thick though undercooked (I like my steaks rare-med. rare but when it comes to burger I prefer medium+ normally.) I didn't mind that too much. Sadly the burger was overall disappointing. The meat was way too under seasoned and they amount of truffle  aioli they put on the burger was sad. I didn't even taste it. There was some on the plate and I tasted it and it was good. Shame they didn't put enough on the burger itself to lend any flavor what so ever. Patty, a slice of melted cheese and a thin squiggle of truffle aioli is all I got. No other toppings that could have helped impart the burger with some flavor.   The fries came out cold. They are super thin and while crispy seemed overlooked and hollow.  Overall my experience was very \"meh.\" Definitely over priced for what you get. I didn't taste quality, poorly seasoned beef led me to tasting not much of anything to be honest. Just the burger and regular fries after tax was $19 and change and I left not satisfied. I suppose I should be thankful they didn't serve the Alton Brown burger as I am a fan of his and if I had such an experience trying the Alton Brown I would be even more disappointed.",

I had always had the truffle or the umami burger, but I tried the sunny side this time! The egg adds a great taste to it!   I can't believe just a small burger can be so filling! They're definitely different than most burgers. Truffle fries is a plus! And when you check in, it's free! Also, their sweet potato fries are good!  I love how clean and different the place is than others. They also serve there condiments on spoons, super cute!  Megan G was such a wonderful server. We were being somewhat complicated, but she was still amazing and didn't mind helping us out! She always had a smile on her face. We need more servers like her! Thank you so much Megan!",

Can't say they were too busy because there was only 5-6 tables being used and the bar had nobody.   Never even got a menu so we left.  Being local I thought this was a new good choice to bring out of town guests for food and gambling. Super embarrassing.:.Beer Park please.  Lots of fun there.",

The hosts were talking and taking their time and ignoring people. When my family sat down, it took forever for the server to come. When he finally came my order was messed up and when I finally got the right order, the food was terrible.   Never again will i ever go this location.",

    "text": "We've been wanting to stop by Umami and try their gourmet burgers in SoCal, so when I saw the Umami Burger Bar at the SLS, I had to give it a try!  The Ahi Tuna burger was so delicious, I brought my hubby the NEXT day before we drove back to CA.  The second lunch was even better than the first! Since we don't eat beef anymore, we split a \"Greenbird\" (turkey) burger and an Ahi Burger (seared with fresh ginger & wasabi sauce) and both were outstanding. The sweet potato fries were good, although they were more than we could eat.  Mandy was our server and she was great !!   Not only was she super friendly and attentive, she genuinely made sure everything was to our liking and the food was cooked to perfection. She even put our tea's in \"to go\" containers for our trip home.   Excellent service and innovative, tasty burgers,..especially for a chain restaurant in Vegas. Umami is definitely worth trying, and we'll be back.",

Loved the fact I could substitute chicken breast turkey patty or portobello mushroom for no extra charge. Also found a Yelp check in for free fries or beer. Got the fab truffle fries. Amazing. Great service. Good food. Only complaint was I have wanted Ahi Tuna on my burger  but the server did not understand when I asked her if it was sushi grade she had  no idea what I was saying.  I overheard hear ask a server who said \"\"always say yes\". I ordered the chicken. English was not her first Language.  Very loud but then again  I'm old.",

And they were good, but really it's the little things that made the meal stand out. Homemade ketchup. Yes. Ketchup. It was really flavorful and tasty. As was the diablo sauce that spiced up the fries nicely. Also, do yourself a favor and ask for the roasted tomatoes. Alone or on top of a burger.  You'll thank me. Finally, the whole meal was tied together by the buoyant and responsive Tashja. Ideal personality to enhance the meal and take the experience NL. We will definitely be back before we leave town. And we will definitely ask for Tashja!",

Had to borrow the ketchup from the next table as we could not find someone to bring us any.  Our waitress didn't even come to check on us until we were nearly done.  Wasn't offered a refill on my tea until they brought the check.  The table next to us seemed to have issues with their experience as well.  For the money, there are far better places in Las Vegas.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were checking out the SLS so we decided to have lunch at Umami Burger.  I had read good things about the chain and was hoping for a good lunch.  Unfortunately Umami Burger did not deliver.   First, they tried to seat us outside in 105 degree heat even though there was plenty of seating inside.  You would think they would at least ask us before we are seated.  The next problem came when we went to order.  My girlfriend asked to add pickles to her burger but was told they couldn't do substitutions or additions because it would \"mess up the flavor profile of the burger\".    I've been to all kinds of restaurants in my life and that was a first.   I ordered the \"manly\" burger cooked medium.  When I got the burger the first thing I noticed was the size.  To call a burger this size a \"manly\" burger is a joke.  The next problem with the burger is that it had cubed bacon on it.  It was chewy and half of it fell off when taking a bite.  After taking a couple of bites I noticed that the burger patty looked pretty red for medium and was literally falling apart.   I took the top of the bun off and the meat stuck to both sides of the bun and was clearly RAW and room temperature.  My girlfriend's burger was cooked more but was still falling apart and mushy.  At this point was was done eating.   I spoke to the waitress and told her I wanted my money back.  She then proceeded to tell me that I didn't understand that their burgers just look raw because the meat is really fresh.  I was floored.  She took my plate and a few minutes later the manager came out and tried to get us to try the burgers again.  He gave us the same explanation about the burgers being raw because the meat is really fresh.  I have been to just about every high end burger place in Vegas and this was by far the worst burger I have ever had in my life.  I'd rather have a Big Mac from McDonalds. Then the manager has the balls to tell me that I just didn't understand their \"fresh\" meat.   At least my girlfriend didn't mess up the raw meat flavor profile with some pickles!  Eventually they comped us the burgers but still got $20 out of us for two Pepsis and an order of fried pickles.   If you're in Vegas and looking for a good burger do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  There are plenty of burger places that will give you an excellent burger the way YOU want it.  At Umami burger you get a raw burger with a side of superiority.",

    "text": "While on vaca at the SLS we ate here looking to see the NBA playoff game.  The hostess was a little overwhelmed I guess I'd call it and it showed.  The inside was crowded due to the game being shown, so we opted to sit outside at the bar, which was okay, I say that becasuse the bar seats weren't that comfortable.  We asked the barmaid if sitting at one the tables was an option and it was, however we had to go back in and have the hostess seat us.  So we did as instructed, but the overwhelmed hostess expressed to us that there weren't many servers for the evening so sitting at a table would mean a long wait.  So we just went back outside and sat back at the bar.  We ordered drinks and our food.  Drinks were good enough and the burger and fries that we ordered were okay.  I truly have had better burgers and fries.  I had the Cali with Truffle fries and my husband had the Manly with skinny fries.  My burger was cooked good the fries were a tad over salted and the ketchup that they make and serve is not that good.  My husband enjoyed his food, but mine was just \"Meh\".  When the check came I felt that I was charged entirely to much for a Vodka lemonade made with Grey Goose and an extra shot $28.00! So I pointed it out to the barmaid and she was thoroughly pissed and bought in the manager to explain why it cost so much. The manager was gracious enough to take $10.00 off of the drink.  Not one of my favorite places.",

One of the entrees was the wrong burger. They fixed it, and the server said she'd get us a dessert for the error, which was nice. Then the appetizer finally arrived and it was also the wrong item! At that point we just wanted to get the heck out of there. The food overall was ok but nothing spectacular. The kitchen needs to get it together and get their orders right.",

We  asked for \"Mandy\" because we were assured she would take care of us. We were in luck because she just so happened to be working! She was also being requested by a party behind us... I guess she is somewhat of a celebrity in these parts ? She was very busy, yet very fast and gave us the personal attention as if we were here only table. I especially liked that she was not \"over the top\" and really was a expert on the menu. She described the cooking process, the choice of meats used and even what beverages would compliment each entree. The recommendations were all spot on as well. We each had selected something different so we could sample everything ( all 6 of us).  I Had the truffle burger... I CAN NOT PUT INTO WORDS HOW AMAZING THIS WAS !  I myself, am opening a sports pub/ lounge and tried to get our server Mandy to come and join my team... (she definitely would have a following) , she of course declined stating she herself would miss umami burgers  to much. I have since visited twice, as it is the spot I take family and friends when they come into town... Definitely exceeds its reputation !",

But food is not their strong point. The signature Umami burger was small and just ok in taste. The sweet potato fries were also just ok. The beet salad was so bitter I could not eat. Service at the counter was lacking, the waiter never refilled water and just stop briefly once to check on me. Expensive for the quality of the food- burger was $12. There are much better burgers on the Strip.",

Our server, Tashja was great. Fast accurate and fun without trying to be our best friend. I had the original, cooked perfect and the mushrooms were great. My wife had the throwback which was also very good. We split an order of thin fries that come with three dipping sauces. A couple of less surly bartenders and this place would be a 5+. Oh, the booths each have a monitor which they will change to your favorite sporting event and with the sports book on site it's great.",

Issue one was it was $12 for just a burger, and fries or any other side that would normally come with the burger at any other place was a seperate cost. It took forever for the food to get to the table and when it did my burger was missing the Portobello mushroom.  It took me several mins to find anyone who noticed me to tell them about the mistake and by that time my husband had finished his burger. When i showed them about the mistake they pointed out two tiny black chunks and said that was the Portobello and it just comes with one mushroom... this was highly insulting so I explained i wasn't going to pay $12 for a burger that didn't come as ordered so she went in the back and brought out 2 Portobello mushrooms. The burgers them selves are nothing to write home about, honestly I could get a better burger at red robins or fuddruckers and pay less. Due to the issue the waitress comped our drinks which was really nice.",

I had a manly burger and a side of thin fries. While I enjoyed the manly burger I would have to recommend the original umami. The manly is heavy and rich but doesn't have the distinct flavor profile of the umami burger. The things fries were well cooked and tasty. I asked for some ketchup which never came but as we were sitting outside all the way on the end service wasn't stellar. The bartenders were very friendly and attentive though. I had no issues placing a couple bets on the NBA playoff games though I was a little disappointed that the sports book closed in the middle of the late game. I was a little worried I wouldn't be able to cash out my ticket until it reopened but I had no problems getting my money at the cage after telling them the sports book had closed. It's definitely a great spot if you a casual sports fan like me who wants to have a couple beers and maybe throw down $20 on a game.",

I read another comment that said they got 3 so i guess they are getting cheaper. The thin fries were also kinda awkward to eat and the ketchup tasted weird.",

    "text": "Eh. It wasn't terrible - quite edible and serves a purpose as an eatery in the sports book of the SLS Casino. Nothing special as far as menu items go .. To a point where I just went with the namesake burger, to get just anything to eat.. Fairly uninspired as a stand alone restaurant concept - just great as a sports book cafe.   We had a giant pretzel and chicken fingers to share and sweet potato fries and an Umami Burger. Heading to a show at The Foundry, we wanted quick and tasty. As I mentioned before, the food was fine. I just. don't see a lot of reason to ever go back just to eat .. We sat in the beer garden that is along Las Vegas Blvd and even still it was just whatevs.   The the pretzel was a large pretzel smeared with mustard. The chicken fingers didn't look worthy of Costco (who have very good chicken fingers available, btw:) the Umami burger was my favorite and it was still pretty basic. The Parmesan tuile was a nice touch - but the single shitake mushroom and single roasted tomato - makes for a \"pretty\" burger (see photo) but a semi boring burger.  I'm still mad about the chicken fingers tho. If they were made in house, which I highly doubt, they were made terribly. I honestly hope they weren't made in house ... So that drops it to 2.5 from a solid 3 stars. Not trying to be mean, they were just not good. Everyone was hungry and one was left uneaten. I couldn't do it so I left mine there. Cuz it sucked. Lol. Anyway.. Happy Eating!",

He said it is till 10 but the last call is at 9:30. I checked my phone and it was 9:33. If they were around at 9:30 we could have placed our order. Anyways it was a very disappointing experience.",

I love her bright, happy personality, and her ability to make sure that our experience is perfect. The customer service experience is on another level because of her, and I can't say enough how much I value that! Good eats, good staff, good place! As a local or just visiting, Umami Burger is worth popping into for sure. Be sure to ask for Aj for a top notch experience.",

The burger wasn't as good - a little dry and crumbly (overcooked for medium). Toppings were really good, though.  The fries here weren't homemade either. What is with Vegas and frozen fries? But I have to admit that they were good with the truffle sauce. Beer selection was much better. though no local beers. I probably enjoyed Umami better, but not enough to make me return. Hoping that the next burger place is better.",

    "text": "I stopped by for the NFL kick-off, which seems like just yesterday, to see the Pats-Steelers game. The place was obviously packed but we still managed to snag a booth. They had several servers walking around handing out free samples. Great for customers, but awful for the servers as many people probably didn't order food or tip well since there were plenty of freebies all night. I tried the skinny fries and sweet potato fries, both were tasty and crispy. I also tried slider version of their truffle burger and hatch burger -- the patties on both juicy and cooked to about medium. The former only had subtle amounts of truffle in the aioli, cheese, and glaze, while the latter had just enough heat to enhance the flavor.   As for the food we ordered, the Korean fries had a mild kimchi flavor paired with sweet potato fries while the chicken wings had to be sent back because they only gave us five instead of the advertised six. They corrected the mistake and  sent out a correct order. Each coated with a crispy exterior coated in a spicy BBQ sauce. The lone full size burger sampled was the Manly burger ($12). A bit small but filling with a densely packed patty topped with house beer-cheddar, bacon lardons, smoked salt onion strings, ketchup and mustard. The branded bun was a nice touch.  The quality and variety of burgers and appetizers lags behind the top burger joints in town, but it was a cool spot to watch the game thanks to the in house sporting book, large TVs scattered around the room and the smaller TV right at our booth.",

Our waitress was very friendly, helpful and accommodating to our large group. She explained the beer menu and took her time in taking all of our orders. She gave us our free yelp fries with a check in. She also gave us a free birthday ice cream sandwich.  Pretty much just because our waitress was awesome, I'm giving it another star.  The food was average.  I felt the same way as I did before when I first tried the food back in LA. The fries were semi crunchy. The grilled chicken nachos were sad and barely could be considered \"nachos.\"   I ordered the grill chicken sandwich and it was alright. The parmesan cheese was a nice texture added to the meal, but it was nothing special.  Overall, I'm not a fan of umami burger at all. It's expensive, and you could get a better burger for much cheaper.",

I'm definitely a burger snob so much so I did a search for the best burger in San Diego and Southwest Riverside County.  Okay so I Yelp some burger spots in Vegas and this is one of the places that came up along with Chef Ramsey. I was in this area anyway and decide to check it out so in order to get here I had to walk through the casino which wasn't a big deal. I found it and was seated pretty quick because I came early evening. My waitress was cool so no problems there and she was easy on the eyes. I ordered the burger and when it came out it looked like it was going to be very good.  The burger was very simple but the ingredients made the burger seem like it was going to be fantastic. I was a little disappointed with the burger because the flavor just wasn't there for me and it wasn't that juicy either. Would I come here again? Yes because I give places second chances!",

I had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich the spice and the flavor were good but the chicken was severely over done. It was so tough and hard. We also had the sweet potato fries they were ok. They tasted like they were from the freezer section of your local grocery store. The highlight of our meal was the appetizer. We ordered the large pretzel and it was delicious. Our server was also great. Other than that this place is pretty overrated",

Already familiar with several of the Umami locations in the LA area so the menu isn't really a surprise to me.  We were greeted and sat right away by the hostess. Our server came a few moments later and got us started with drinks and allowed us wayyy too much time to look over the menu. She pretty much disappeared on us throughout our dining experience. We asked other servers for help but they said they would call our server for us..not sure if they really did because it took her so long to return to us.  Food wise, their burgers are good.",

We then returned to watch the Duck game and were amazed with the all you can drink package during the game.  Yep I said it outloud All You Can drink for the duration of your game 2 hours and man we took advantage of that for sure.   If your looking for a great place this is it!

We checked them out because they carry the vegetarian Impossible Burger.  The venue is lively and comfortable. It basically also serves as the sports book area. The service is adequate, but misses the target frequently. They may or may not know you've been seated and they may or may not bring you things you've requested. But they are friendly.  We tried their Throwback and Impossible burgers. The portions are good, but feel a little over-priced for what you get. Strip prices basically. The Throwback was fine. The Impossible was a very impressive vegetarian burger that tasted and felt like real meat.  All in all, you'll have a good meal and a good experience here, but we probably won't be back any time soon due to the high prices.",

The first night I was there I absolutely avoided it because I was scarred from the first visit. All I could remember was being disappointed because someone told me that they had the best burgers in Vegas. Still not True if you ask me but they are certainly good.  Anyway, my coworkers convinced me to give it another shot, so I did just that and to my surprise it was way better from what I remembered. I actually enjoyed the burger, fries, and beer that I ordered and I certainly felt that the pricing was pretty great.   In fact, i went there for a second night and enjoyed another burger. My only gripe was that the wings that we ordered left me unimpressed but I definitely recommend it for a cheap good meal at the SLS. If I stay at this hotel again I am certain that I'd go back for another burger.",

    "text": "I've been looking forward to trying a Umami Burger ever since I saw a TV special on them a few years back. I spike my own burgers with everything from fish sauce to marmite, so this is a burger I knew I could appreciate.  It was an exciting moment when I finally wrapped my hands around a $12.95 Umami Burger consisting of a 6-ounce beef patty reportedly made from American Wagyu beef and seasoned with soy sauce, ground-up dried porcini mushrooms, and dried fish head dust. Toppings included roasted tomatoes (tomatoes slow-baked in soy sauce), shiitake mushrooms, caramelized onions, and a round parmesan cheese crisp (referred to as a \"frico.\") The burger was served on a Portuguese-style roll.  Imagine my horror as the flavor of the burger tasted muddled going down, almost like the burger was not made of meat, but instead of mushrooms or vegan ingredients. To be fair, the after-taste of the burger lingering in my mouth after I swallowed was good, quite \"beefy\" -- but there was something \"off\" by a mile with this.  After another bite, I identified that the burger was waaaay under-seasoned, despite whatever umami infusions happened in the meat. The lack of salt in this burger was tragic -- think of drinking a can of Coca-Cola without sweetener (sugar or otherwise) and how weird and jarring that would be. Salt is nature's best and most powerful flavor-enhancer. It is bizarre that a restaurant so focused on achieving a big umami flavor would eschew salt, likely relying on the soy sauce for salt rather than seasoning the meat manually.  Another crucial element was lacking: one of the best ways to generate umami flavor is to invoke a Maillard Reaction (e.g. browning reaction) and generating a flavorful crust on the meat. Yet, my Umami Burger looked baked rather than grilled and did not go through this process, arguably the most important flavor-producing reaction within all of cooking.  Some of the toppings were more effective than others. The roasted tomato confit was good (yay! flavor!), but the caramelized onions were just barely discernable. The burger needed cheese, and the problem with the parmesan cheese crisp is that it doesn't hug the burger the way a melted slice of cheese would, and it seems very separate from everything else when I was chewing it all.  On the other hand, the thin Truffle Fries I ordered were very tasty -- salty and crisp, smothered in melted cheese and a well-restrained amount of truffle flavor. Best of all, they're free with a Yelp check-in. If I found myself at the SLS late-night and hungry, I may hit up Umami Burger for the fries, but I probably would not get another burger.  I'm interested in knowing what I'm missing here. Somehow this restaurant remains in business and is known for its burgers -- what am I not getting?  Food/Decor/Service: 2.6/2.5/3.5",

When the food came both items were cold and uninspiring.  After about ten minutes we got the staff to pay attention to us.  We did get replacements for all and the second round of burgers were better.  The fries reminded me of gravy not truffle style, not sure what that was all about.  The 2 stars is due to the fact that they comped us the food.  TIP FOR the PLACE - WARM up the hatch chiles so it doesn't take away from the heat of the burger.",

It had a great sort of roasted flame flavor that really kicked it up a notch.   I had the truffle cheese fries. Those were really good but not amazing. A little too much cheese for my states. I ordered the salted caramel ice cream sandwich to finish and that was incredibly good. Simple but packed with flavor. Highly recommend.  It is a unique layout with one very large room with couches and leather chairs underneath massive big tv screens for sports fans. On the perimeter of the big room are booths with individual TVs.  I definitely think it's a good chocked for football and food. I don't know if I would make a special trip just for the food as the menu is a bit small. But either way the burgers are excellent.",

    "text": "I was skeptical trying Unami Burger at first because of some of the low reviews. I had  a 50% off coupon because it was my birthday month so I figured , \"why not\"? I called ahead of time to the hotel's players club to see how to redeem the coupon and they told me to redeem it at Unami Burger. When I got to Unami Burger they told me to go to the players club to redeem it ....see the run around. Finally the players club had to work with Unami on how to redeem it. When I got back the fries were cold and the burger was warm but at least the problem was solved.   I had the Manly Burger which consisted of beer cheddar, bacon lardons (bacon chunks), smoked salt onion strings, house ketchup, and mustard. The burger was juicy and had a distinctive taste it didn't taste like a burger from Jack and the Box or anything like that. The burger was overall very tasty. The Make em Manly fries was a different story. In short they tasted pretty bad the fries being cold didn't help either. It had the same toppings as the burger but the taste differed in the fries . It was too salty for me to eat and the fries were not crispy enough to withstand the toppings. The fries ended up a soggy mess. I ended with Mintimalism for dessert. It's a double chocolate chip cookies with dirty mint chip ice cream. I wouldn't suggest this unless you really like mint like I do. It felt like Christmas in my mouth which was great because I wanted to get rid of the salty taste of the fries out of my mouth.   The service was very accommodating despite the birthday coupon snafu. They kept checking on us to see if we needed anything else. If you don't want to try Unami for full price the SLS offers 50% off one of their restaurants every Sunday. You would need to call ahead to the players club to see which one is being discounted on that Sunday.",

Unfortunately, I didn't want the buffet since I had heard some bad things about it so decided to go to a better place (being Umami).  I know there are other Umami burgers (one in SF), but I definitely wanted to try it.   As a family we ordered the smother 'em fries and a some nachos. We had them to share. The nachos were good - like regular nachos with beef. However the smother 'em fries are delicious. Gravy and shredded short ribs are a delicious topping to fries. It's really like poutine without the cheese curds. Wished that we could just get the fries poutine style!   I ended up ordering the Royale burger - with short ribs, truffled aioli, and truffle cheese. All this truffle is delicious in a burger. My dad ordered the original which he enjoyed. Brother ordered the B.U.B. which was a big burger. 2 patties is quite a bit to eat, but he seemed to have enjoyed it a lot. Mom ordered the ahi tuna burger. Delicious!   Overall, decent service, kind of slow, but there quite a few people eating at 9, but then again it is Vegas. Burgers came before the nachos and fries which we wanted as an appetizer which was kind of weird.",

    "text": "Ok sorry I  know that as a Vegan I should not have any expectations of being able to eat something in a burger joint.  Serious I know this.  But when you travel with people that eat meat there is a certain amount of compromise that must be done.  So there I was at the Umani Burger - went all the way to vegas to eat at a chain, so disappointing.    Anyway,  I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was a portabella burger on the menu,  so I order this to share with Buttercup and then we find out that the bun has butter, so our waiter enthusiastically informs us that he can make it a wrap and will take care of us so we order the portabella and sweet potato fries.    Ok what comes out is the just wrong on so many levels.  it is a grilled mushroom and a couple leaves of lettuce.  no tomato, no onions pickles like nothing.... I ask for tomato or something he leaves and comes back to tell me the tomatoes are not vegan.  Whaaaatttt?  ok so we eat our mushroom and lettuce and them try to fries.  They are covered in sugar and cinnamon. super gross who decided this is a good idea.  So at this point our waiter is avoiding us,  I catch him because he can't avoid the customers around us and request regular fries.  He brings he takes away the desert fries and brings us regular ones.  They could use a little salt, but the table has none,  what every we eat this and wait for our bill.  The bill finally arrives and yes they charged us 12.95 for a portabella mushroom and a couple pieces of lettuce.  Really if the kitchen or our waiter had put any effort at all into making this decent then that would have been one thing but not so much.  The draft beer selection was decent. My friends enjoyed their burger so if you want a burger then it beats McDonalds and they have beer so sure go for it.",

On Mondays, KU noodle is closed, and so are most the other \"light bite\" places at lunch, so Umami was the ultimate choice. We got the most lively waiter ever, being 1pm in the afternoon and hung over, he happily brought us everything we needed to remedy our ailments.    The burgers are on-par with the LA counterparts, but I still wish they would ditch the ketchup in a spoon concept. I need more ketchup than that. The garlic fries are bomb, but the sweet potato fries were a bit dry. The best part of the meal was the mint chocolate icecream sandwiches. Real mint leaves infused in icecream wedged between two chocolate cookies. B.O.M.B. Must try for anyone who hasn't had it.",

I've been here four times total, with visits for both lunch and dinner last Wednesday.  On Wednesday night, we came for game one Cavs/Hawks. There are plenty of televisions so you can catch your favorite baseball team also. For drinks, we had the bucket of 5 beers for $20. If you have your Code card, they offer drink specials for members. Ashley took good care of us for the duration of our stay. No complaints with our service this time or any time previously.  We had nachos and wings while we were there. Both were average. We didn't get any burgers that night, but I've had three on the menu. And while not the best ever, a few of them have some unique twists and I would rate them above average. I like the sunny side and hatch. We also received a free order of delicious ice cream sandwiches using a coupon which was in the discount booklet for guests staying at the hotel.  The biggest draw for me is the sports book along with the in game wagering if you're following the flow of the game. We were pumped that the Cavs took game one on the road. We were even more pumped that we took the +2. We took our $100 winnings after we cashed our ticket, gave it to Ashley, and walked out happy without giving away a dime out of our pockets. I'll be back for drink specials, to get some action on the game I'm watching, or just to hang out, possibly in the beer garden.",

I was curious to know about the bacon londrons that came on the Manly burger and she did an excellent job explaining it to me. We got the nachos and we both got the Manly burger. When I tell you those nachos were DELICIOUS! And the BURGER! The actual burger was seasoned so well and it was so juicy. The cheese spread that was on it was so flavorful and those bacon londrons set it off real proper like! Everything is a la carte. Slightly pricey, but it's VEGAS!",

    "text": "We came here for #SocialSundays when locals get 50% off the menu at a selected restaurant and obviously, on a Sunday. What a fabulous deal! I made a reservation through OpenTable and requested a table in their Beer Garden. The hostess couldn't find my reservation, but luckily, I resolved that through OpenTable. Fortunately, it wasn't busy yet and we were seated in our preferred area immediately.   Side note: They're open an hour earlier (10AM) on Saturdays and Sundays during football season. If you sit inside, there's a $50 F&B minimum PER PERSON during the 10AM games. This does not apply to the Beer Garden though!  The Beer Garden is their outdoor patio facing Las Vegas Blvd. There are several televisions along the walls showing multiple games. The seating is picnic tables and very casual. There's also an entrance/exit to street, but you can't just seat yourself. It was a great atmosphere, especially with the beautiful weather that day. They don't allow smoking on the patio, but some patrons thought that hanging their arm off the patio railing meant that they were abiding. Yeah, no. The smoke was bothersome and off-putting.  Our server was really nice and with supporting staff, everyone was relatively attentive to our needs. The manager was constantly walking around the restaurant and he was approachable. There was an issue where we were watching a particular game and it was switched abruptly (however, the audio remained on that game) and we spoke to our server and the manager to have it resolved. First, we were told by our server that they do not change the channels for anyone or any reason (Really?). Second, we were told by the manager that the games switch automatically during Half Time, however, the television did not revert back after the game had resumed the second quarter. It took approximately 15 minutes for the game to FINALLY appear! No explanation as to what occurred. I can't imagine anyone being happy if this happens often during big games.  Truffled Beet Salad ($7): truffled ricotta, smoked almonds, wild baby arugula, and truffle dressing. The arugula was fresh. The truffle wasn't too overpowering. Overall, a decent salad, but nothing special. It's missing something - I didn't get that \"umami\" factor.  Fried Pickles ($6): artisan-crafted pickles, jalapeno, ranch, and shaved Parmesan. The pickles were okay; still had a bit of crunch. The batter was light.  Nothing remotely worthy of a repeat.  Smushed Potatoes ($4) with roasted garlic aioli. These were good. The potatoes were nice and soft inside while having some exterior texture. Their roasted garlic aioli is great.  Thin Fries ($3): Nothing special, but not terrible.  Umamify Your Fries - Truffle 'Em ($3): truffle cheese fondue and truffle salt. This definitely made their boring fries much more exciting. Nothing I'd come back for though.  Hatch Burger ($11): Roasted green chiles, house American cheese, and roasted garlic. This was just okay. It wasn't cooked medium rare like we requested. There was nothing exciting or even good. I can barely recall its taste now.  The Original ($12): Parmesan frico, shiitake mushroom, roasted tomato, caramelized onions, and Umami house ketchup. This burger was terrible. The burger had no flavor and I didn't have anything remotely close to an \"umami\" experience with it. Oh, and you know how it says you get \"shiitake mushroom\" with your burger? Yeah, you really get only ONE mushroom and it had the circumference of half dollar coin! WTF?! How does that make any sense? Why wouldn't you slice the ridiculously small mushroom and attempt to distribute it on the entire burger? You get the experience of a shiitake mushroom, but only in one bite. You're SOL with the rest of the burger.  Spanish Royalty Combo ($35): Jose Andres Burger and Estrella Damm Inedit. The Jose Andres Burger ($15 individually) has a pork and cured ham patty, piquillo pepper confit, caramelized onions, Manchego cheese, and roasted garlic aioli. The Estrella Damn Inedit (750mL; $25 individually) is a malt and wheat beer created by Ferran Adria and his El Bulli team in 2009. So, you save $5 with the combo. Thank goodness this burger was good! It earned the additional star. The patty was juicy and the whole burger was extremely flavorful (or maybe just in comparison to the other tasteless burgers). I was happy with this burger. Ruben enjoyed the beer very much.  The food was extremely disappointing. We've been to Umami Burger in California and really enjoyed it, so this experience was surprising. The burgers are much smaller than the ones we had there. Even the Smushed Potatoes are smaller! Everything was hit with a shrink ray when it came to Las Vegas. The sides were decent, but the burgers (the Jose Andres Burger being the exception) were offensive! Also, I'm not sure when you receive the soup spoons with dipping sauces, but we weren't offered!",

Husband had the Original Sin apricot cider, which was ok, but I like their straight cider better.  The chicken fingers were indeed extra crispy and well done.  The jalapeno ranch dip was strongly jalapeno and the first bite was a little much for me.   When I added less dip to chicken it was tasty.   Husband liked the burger...saying the bacon lardons (like French fry sized bacon pieces) was weird but good.   We also got a flight of the beers...mostly from the local Tenaya Creek, which were pretty good (keep in mind we are not big beer drinkers).

Didn't check up on us frequently how he did his other two tables.  Food was not the best! The burgers were plain no lettuce just meat, cheese, and a sauce. I got the the classic and it had a roasted tomato I felt like I was eating a meatball sub. The truffle burger was better but still plain. Fries got soggy real Quick, onion rings were over battered and soggy. The only thing I liked was my jasmine green tea. I did not feel like I got my money's worth. I spent $50 for nothing. All a hype.

    "text": "I vouched for Umami in my BurGR review, only knowing what existed in LA. Since my visit to Umami in Las Vegas I have gone ahead and altered that.   It's been years since my visit to a Umami, but I remember the trendy vibe they'd have going on. It's a negative here, it's got the feel of a Hooters.  The sports book? They have a guy in a polo taking bets with lunch order style betting sheets.  The service was moody. One second they smile with your greeting, then they don't at your order taking, then they do when they bring you your food and then they...you get it.  Umami Stuff  The burgers were the only thing that I could close my eyes to and feel like I was on Cahuenga Blvd.  Truffle Burger: The truffle everything gave it a melty taste that faded into your taste buds quite nicely. The meat was cooked how I ordered it. Another solid one at Umami. 4/5  Sliders: I love caramelized onions. So to pack that in a bite size serving was nice.  The overall was nothing short of what I would expect but nothing above. 3.75/5  Truffle Fries: I'm such a sucker for the word truffle. They were alright. I wouldn't say that their truffle cheese is the best match for everything but the fries were well fried and that didn't hurt the topping. 3.75/5  Boring Review  I felt no energy writing this and it might be because I pictured myself there all over again. The burgers are Umami burgers but the ambiance and service just did not feel like it has in the past at other locations. I would not recommend a stop at Umami Las Vegas but I will say their burgers are a must try. It makes sense, believe me, it makes sense.",

I tried the impossible burger for the first time and it was amazing and I can understand how it got it's name... drool, for a non red meat alternative... it really established what vegetarian can taste like.

    "text": "Before heading to the airport, totally spent from a few days of \"conventioneering\" and a little late-night indulgence with friends, I needed some some lunch...hello Umami Burger!  Turned out, it was a great spot to relax, watch some sports, have a beer from their excellent selection of brews and eat good food with friendly, efficient service.  My wife ordered a pretzel to get started - YES!  A giant, yummy pretzel showed up with two dipping sauces (a cup of dark mustard and a cup of melted cheese.)  Loved it.  I ordered a turkey burger with sweet potato fries for lunch. Oh my, it was delicious - all of it!  The burger was not giant, but sized appropriately for a normal human being.  It was beautifully presented and tasted delicious.  The sweet potato fries showed up in a sizable bowl sprinkled with sugar & cinnamon (they were delightfully good and complimented the tart green sauce on the turkey burger.)  In all, a rewarding lunch experience.  I'd like to return sometime and have a few brews in the beer garden.  4 stars",

So the fries looked yummie, but wayyyy too salty.  So the burger was dry, so I had to ask for more sauce.  As I was eating it, it seemed to also be way to salty.  Com'on Umami, ease up off the salt!  Let people add there own salt to it.  I couldn't even finish my burger or fries.  I only ate 1/2.  And if anyone knows me, I try and eat everything on my plate, and I couldn't do it.  Even 1/2 was a bit much.  Heck I guess we broke even, because I used the local speciall they were running.  Locals eat for 1/2 price and that's all I ate was 1/2.  I would have been pissed if I would have paid full price for this burger, it wasn't worth it!",

After reading some fellow Yelpers reviews I wasn't expecting much but the food ended up tasting pretty darn good.  I opted for the Hatch with a portobello mushrooms rather then the burger just to mix things up a bit. The flavor was great! It was a bit messy to eat since the chillies kept sliding out and the bun was a little bit bland, but overall very good.   I also went with the side of truffle fries, yum. They had a cheesy topping on them as well as plenty truffle flavor. I personally love skinny fries so these were right up my alley.  I must say it was a bit pricey for a burger joint, but it is technically the strip after all so you kind of have to expect that. My bill came to around $30 for a \"burger,\" fries and pear cider.",

The SLS is involved in the Rock N Roll 5K event, and had several participants staying at their hotel. I came here prior to the run, and my BF stayed here while it was going on.   Arrived to a fairly empty restaurant area, despite the busy casino floor and many race participants around- BF approached the bar to order a beer,  placed a bet at the counter, and watched a game. After being gone nearly an hour, I returned. BF stated he hadn't been able to order anything, because no one had come by. At all. In almost an hour.  We stuck around a little longer to see how a game ended, then went to another property to dine. This is now the second time we have tried to come here and apparently the staff do not have any interest in providing service. It's not due to lack of staff: there are plenty chatting away to one another. I have no idea how this place stays open.",

Umami is a sportsbook as well, so it was pretty lively on Sunday at 12pm with plenty of people in gear rooting for their team.  1. Ambiance is lively. There are hightops, tables, booths with personal TVs, bar with games, AND comfy coaches in front of HUGE screens. 5/5  2. Drinks are good. Upon checking in we redeemed free 16 red rock beers. The other option is free fries. I purchased two additional ones at $7 each with an additional whisky shot $5 each. They have many size options available to accommodate all sizes of thirsty. 5/5  3. Food was AMAZING! My date had the manly burger. He is quite a big guy himself but was full for hours after.  I did not taste it, but he raved about richness and amazing taste.  I had the ahi tuna seared burger. WOW! This was so delicious,  a must try! I had lettuce and tomato added.  I really like that it was a full leaf, not shredded.  We added some tasty wings and truffle fries , so delicious! 5/5  4. Service is solid here. We were welcomed immediately and sat without wait. After our server took orders, another waitress brought waters and place settings.  Despite it being a packed house , service never lagged! We were never left empty handed and they took all empty plates and cups during our meal. Perfect! 5/5",

We shared our order of chicken tender, umami burger, and sweet potato fries. The chicken tender was just perfect and crispy! Umami burger was juicy with great flavors. The crispy cheese! Yum. It's different, but good. Sweet potato... meh. It was way too sweet. It taste kind of like candy or maybe too much cinnamon on it? *shrugs*  -1 Star: Service was a little slow since I think there was only 1 or 2 waitress on the floor.

    "text": "Bad experience: There are plenty of welcoming restaurants in Vegas. Don't waste your time and money at this one.  A friend of mine stopped in to grab a late night meal. I had just won big on the slot machines and we wanted to celebrate. We opted to sit at the bar. My friend asked another customer at the bar playing the game, would she mind switching her purse to the other side so she wouldn't hit it or get any food on it. The customer, in an escalated voice, said no, I was here first and I'm not moving anything. So as soon as more seats became available, we slid down a little from the customer. We proceeded to order our meal with a nice male waiter. Then a female waitress that apparently knows the customer, started chatting about the brief incident rather loudly at the bar. We interceded and explained that it wasn't an issue, we just didn't want to hit her purse and at that time, the bar was packed with people. The female waitress started saying that gamers are the priority and she was there. We continued to explain that it wasn't a big deal. But the waitress became irate and started screaming at us. Then she placed a chair in between us and the customer. Which wasn't necessary. We were minding our business and eating chips and queso by this time. Then, a security officer comes out of nowhere and tells us to move to the other side of the bar. By this point, we are frustrated because we just wanted something to eat. We have no idea why we were not wanted at the bar. We paid with green money just like the gamer who was friends with the waitress and should have been treated equally. Once the security officer came, I chose to pay for our appetizer and beverage and cancel the rest of our food. We should not be giving our money to a business that treats customers this way.",

Annoyed we went to a different Area to enjoy the game and again before even getting a drink order we were being told there would be a minimum per person.

We ended up having a few food allergies that our waiters helped us figure out and get them food they could yet.

    "text": "I finally got a chance to check out SLS.   Pros-Came here on Thursday night football, and WOW! They have like a 150 4K foot screen and it was beautiful! Surround sound was incredible. Restaurant is built different then what u expect but it was cool.   Ordered the manly burger because quite frankly I'm a man. Lol it was very tasty. Wasn't blown away by it but it def did the job. The sweet potatoes fries are INCREDIBLE! They add like brown sugar to them. It's heaven In your mouth! (Pause) lol Server was really sweet and pleasant. My burger didn't come out to the specific temp I wanted and they took it off my bill. I didn't even complain! That was a huge plus I just upped her gratuity .   Cons- good beer list but some of their beer was over priced. 12$ for a Octoberfest? 14$ for a Duval? That's ridiculous lol. Maybe more menu items in the future it was pretty limited. If you don't like sports don't come here during game time (I do love sports by the way) but it gets  pretty loud.  Overall I'm glad I waited to come here. I will def be back!",

    "text": "Went to Umami for dinner. There were 3 of us, no alcohol, and the tab was $74 without tip just to give you an idea of the prices. Burgers are about $12, but do not come with any sides. I think that's the new trend following the lead of the pricey steakhouses. Everything is a la carte, so what you think is a $12 burger actually becomes a $15 - $20 burger once you add some fries or another side.  I had the Manly burger with American cheese and bacon. The bacon chunks were tasty, crispy on the outside and chewy inside - just right. I was hesitant on trying this place because of the negative reviews. My burger was very tasty, meat cooked right, and overall and above average burger. My wife had the Original and she loved the Parmesan frigo on it. Her cousin had the Truffle Especiale.  He loves the fried runny egg on the burger. I should have added a fried egg on my Manly burger. That would have been awesome. I have an issue with them charging $5 for a soda. I don't even know if the soda is bottomless because they only serve bottles. A Pepsi is $5, really?  Desert is an average size cookie sandwich for $7. It was OK. We tried the salted caramel ice cream with snicker doodle cookie.  Ambience - a sports bar with booths around the perimeter, and tables in the middle. Each booth had a small TV, but you can't control what is on your booth TV. That really doesn't make sense with all of the channels they have available. We wanted to watch a different game. The waiter made up some story that the \"guy\" with the remote was walking around and would change the channel to whatever channel we wanted. We never saw the \"guy\" with the remote. The people ranged in age and style from club goers having a bite to eat before hitting the club to an elderly group grabbing some burgers. There were some couples there as well. The middle of the floor has a living room type setup with large screen TVs and leather couches around some coffee tables. You can sit there and have a beer and burger, and bend down to eat over the coffee table like you do in your own living room. My wife didn't get it why there were a bunch of guys using the couches to eat. Gives you the opportunity to stand up and walk around if the game is stressing you out.  Service - sub par. I think it was just our waiter. Everything was soooo slow with him. He spent 90% of his time standing in the kitchen. I could see his bald head through the window of the kitchen door while waiting for water, to order something, desert, the check, etc. I actually gave the lowest tip I have in a long time (15%). I usually give 20% without question, but wanted to make a point. Hopefully, he gets it. He was a very nice guy, just very frustrating to have to wait for him every time we needed something. Waiter, try walking around to your tables more and ask people how they are doing. Make yourself available. The restaurant is charging premium prices for burgers. The service should match. This isn't McDonalds. Charge me McDonalds prices and I will happily get my own napkins and ketchup.   Summary - get the burger of your liking and one order of thin fries to share between 2-3 people. Burgers are good if you get them medium. Drink water or a beer (somewhat overpriced at $8 for domestic). All sodas aren't worth the price.  Skip the apps. The fried pickles ($6) taste like Vlasic yellow pickles with some breading that falls right off on the first bite. They were overly sour, and not like good deli pickles.  Skip desert as well. If you must have, split one cookie between two people.",

    "text": "I took advantage of a discount coupon (spend $50, get $20 off) to check out Umami Burger a few nights before Christmas.   It was my first visit there, & first time dining at a restaurant inside the SLS.    Things can be somewhat deceiving -- the gaming floor inside SLS at about 7PM on a Thursday night was absolutely dead.  I felt sorry for some of the dealers, etc. as they just stood there.  Some were just looking at the floor, one was actually filing her nails(!!) and when others made eye contact with you, it reminded me of volunteering at the local animal shelter, where the dogs all gaze up at you & beg you with their eyes to take them out for a walk...    Anyway, my friend & I were seated promptly (no reservation), and a waiter quickly stopped by to take our drink orders.   My iced tea was about $4, so when it showed up not filled-up to anywhere close to the top of the glass, I was rather annoyed, but thankfully, they had free refills so it was a non-issue.  My friend ordered a burger, as a vegetarian, I the one burger I could have -- the \"Sloppy Mami\" burger.   We decided to share an order of Battered Onion Rings, Smushed Potatoes &  Thin Fries with the Truffle treatment.    The best way to describe the atmosphere & ambience of the SLS Umami Burger -- at least at the time we were there -- is SPORTS BAR!   There were dozens of TVs all over the place, *plus* the SLS 'Sports Book' is just there on the other side of a rail -- its basically part of Umami Burger, whether they describe it that way or not.  Seems like if you're wagering at the sport book, you're basically going to sit at one of the tables used by Umami Burger.   The place was loud -- so loud that my friend & I really couldn't carry on much of a conversation.  I have no idea if it's always like that, or perhaps there were just some particularly 'important' games going on that evening (I'm not a sports fan...).    My \"Sloppy Mami\" burger was, despite the name & list of ingredients, actually pretty tasty so I was pleasantly surprised.  A lot of 'upscale' burger places just glop a bunch of vegetables together into a patty to make one token burger for us vegetarians & that's what I was expecting, but the Umami people actually seemed to put a lot of thought & effort into designing theirs, and it was very good.   My friend said his burger was good.    The onion rings were just OK -- not a lot of flavor to them unless you dipped them into the ketchup, and them they tasted like ketchup.  Come to think about it, onion rings at most places are pretty bland.  Umami was no exception.    Thankfully, the thin fries & Smushed Potatoes were great -- mostly thanks to the truffle flavoring.    All in all, food & service were very good.  If I was big into football, I suppose I may have appreciated the atmosphere, but there's a difference between showing some sports on TV & being a sports bar, and at least during prime-time hours, Umami Burger is absolutely a noisy sports bar.    In retrospect, they do have outdoor seating -- a semi climate controlled patio looking out onto Las Vegas Blvd.  I'm not sure if it's only open seasonally, and I know it does have TV sets in that section too, but it may have provided us with a quieter environment.    It can be a lot of fun to people-watch along the Las Vegas Strip but the Umami Burger patio area is back a couple dozen yards from the Strip/sidewalk, plus the SLS is on what at least these days is considered the far Northern extreme of the LV Strip, so there's not a lot of action to watch.    Would I go back?   Maybe in a couple months, if I had another coupon, yes.   But without a coupon, I can get food I like better elsewhere, cheaper.    If I was into sports & staying at the SLS, I'd go there to grab a beer & watch the game.",

It was soooo tender, juicy and flavorful. We really enjoyed it. The onion rings were breaded nicely and fried, but not greasy. Unfortunately they were totally flavorless. We told our waitress, but it wasn't taken off the bill or anything despite us clearly eating less than half of them.   The wings were ok. I felt the bleu cheese dipping sauce was really a detriment to the wings as it was nearly bitter and a runny consistency....rather odd in my opinion. I love dipping my wings in bleu cheese, so I was really let down on that one  I also ordered a Pepsi because my hypoglycemia had badly kicked in, so I was really surprised to see it come in a bottle. Definitely trendy, but honestly, I prefer it from the fountain, especially for the price and no refill.   The presentation was really impressive, the atmosphere was really fun and laid back, especially for people like us who had literally only been in town for maybe an hour. I enjoyed finding my hometown pro team stickers on the wall, and cheering on a few teams on the huge tv's. I really like how they have so many games going so you get a nice variety. We really liked the SLS, so it would be a place we'd gladly try again",

I put my $20 in the machine and then the bartender informs me that the large beers r not compted when u play.  Isn't that nice?  After I ordered.   After I said something she did fix the issue with a smaller beer. However I was already done once again with this place.

You'd think someone who works at a place that caters to tourists would have a little more patience.   I'd wanted to try this place for a good while. Now that I have, I can say I am unimpressed.

The restaurant had been plenty of room and seating inside and outside.  Wide range of beer selection and very nice staff.  The only thing I was a little unhappy about was how long the service took. I will definitely be back for the Ahi Tuna burger for sure!",

My husband ordered a Guinness that was all foam and the waitress told him to just \"give it time.\"  It ended up half foam still so we sent it back. I ordered the hatch burger and my husband ordered the manly burger. We also got a side of sweet potato fries. The burgers were good, but definitely not the best burgers we've ever had. If I'm making a trip to the strip for burgers, i would rather eat at Gordon Ramsey Burgr or Burger Bar. Atmosphere is cool--would be fun with a group of people to watch a game. Prices were decent for the strip.",

    "text": "What can I say other then I love this place. Not just because of the great hand made food made to order but because when you're located in Vegas, you get sectional couches to relax on and tons of TV screens located throughout this fine location. Oh did I also mention that you can place bets on any sports games there while you eat.   Umami burger is conveniently located with the beautiful SLS casino at the end of the strip. So because it's a new casino what better way to pull people in then to build one of the best burger joints to eat at. The layout of this place is awesome! The have a bar and bench area that overlooks the strip but puts you right in front of this wall size TV screen. That's almost every mans dream right there, to have huge burgers covered with truffle cheese sauce and a cold beer.   I will say they also have extra dishes on there menu compared to the California locations. So that was a pleasant surprise. So the first time I was there I ordered there standard truffle burger, (I love truffles) so this burger was packed with flavor and a side of oozing and rich truffle fries. On day two I ordered the 12oz. double patty, caramelized onion infused B.U.B burger. If you're on a diet or squeamish, I suggest you not order this burger. It will keep you set for the rest of the day.  So when in Vegas or staying at the SLS, stop by umami burger. It's never let me down and hopefully it won't for you.",

But of course our waiter had to put the 2 cheapest burgers on our groupon. -_-  I don't think I would ever come back here. It took 15 minutes just for us to get our check. Another 10 minutes just to get our receipt that I needed to sign. It seems like all the waiter and waitresses attention were towards the ones who kept ordering alcohol.",

I really didn't know what to expect, but everything ended up being phenomenal.   I had 2 great IPA's that my server, Abby recommended to me. She knew I was eating alone, so she was extra sweet and chatted with me about my conference and suggested some local things to do that evening.   I told Abby that I suffer from celiac, and she helped me pick something out that was gluten free. I ended up with the fabulous Turkey Green Bird and a side of Sweet Potato fries. YUM! Great suggestion, especially for those of us who love a turkey burger.  I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this place all around. It was a great spot for lunch, and the service was exceptional. I will definitely be back on my next trip to LV!   Thanks to the great staff, food, and BEER! :)",

It was also topped with shiitake mushrooms, roasted tomato, carmelized onions, and house ketchup. The top bun is seared with a letter 'U' for Umami!

However it was overlooked, asked for medium, came out pretty well, no pink in the center, but we didn't send it back. Was just hungry from the pool.   The thing I did not like at all was the maple bacon frites. It was too gooey (too much syrup). You can't even taste the sweet potato fries and it was greasy. They give you about 3 pieces of bacon bites, you have to search for it. Just stick with regular fries, onion rings or sweet potato with nothing on them.",

    "text": "First time having Umami burger, & honestly, I think people just live for the \"hype\" of this place.   First, customer service was terrible. For a very slow night out waitress's only came to our table once to refill our glasses (which were empty for 20 mins). The restaurant only had 5 tables occupied & a couple people at the bar. Not only was my boyfriend & I waiting for our glasses to be filled, but also the table across from us. Before we got our food, I noticed my knife pretty dirty. It seemed like there was still food residue on it. I asked our waitress if I can have another knife, & she came 10 mins after we got our food to give me the knife. Which was useless.  Second, the food came at a good time, we didn't wait too long. The burger I got was the sunny side burger, which had the egg in it. I enjoyed my burger very much. The meat was juicy & not too much crap in it; just the greens, cheese, patty, & the egg. My boyfriend got the regular burger & his was just plain bland. We even put a onion ring just to have some type of crunch or flavor, but nothing. On the sides we had onion rings which were pretty good with their homemade ketchup. The fries, we ordered from the secret menu & had the \"manly\" fries. It had truffle sauce, cheese, & bacon bits on it. The fries were cold and did not even taste like it came from the fryer. It wa soggy and had way too much sauce. The fries even tasted like stale potatoes. The bacon bits were real bacon, but it was so hard that I'm questioning if that bowl of French fries were sitting out for awhile before it was served to us.  Overall, place is alright & they're burger... Well the sunny side burger was good.",

Unfortunately the service was quite the opposite..  the first time we showed up we had placed an order at 11:00PM for a few of their signature jose andrees burgers.  we were standing around waiting, they said they could text us when it was ready so I left my # and we hit the tables.   a few heaters later, no text.  some more heaters, still no text.  no text, no calls, no texts. you get the point..  we went back and had inquired about our burgers through an employee who said she would go and check, she left.  inquired again through another employee, he left.. never came back.  we saw them bring out several to-go orders and leave them on the bar counter and we had asked if either of them were ours.. the waitress said not yet and she, just like the others said she would go and check.  at around 12:15AM my friend said forget it, he hopped the line and started checking bags. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? our order was sitting on the counter and the completed ticket said 11:30PM.  Our burgers were sitting on the counter for 45 minutes, cold as a pair of rock solid fake silicon implants.  ***we asked the girl at the bar, she said sorry, I can get you guys a free round what would you like? **I asked for a Hennessy on the rocks and she said SORRY, ONLY WELL-DRINKS. OR A BEER. I dont want to sound like a snob but keep in mind we paid $40 for two burgers and some FRIES?!?  the manager said sorry, ill see if they can make you a new set. after eating they were just nuked a bit because the bread was softer than a pair of real.. well, nevermind.  he apologized and said if we came back he would take care of us.  we ordered $220 worth of burgers to the rooms and the truffle fries were delicious. we also came back and dined in to watch the sunday games while gambling away our life savings and the waiter wearing the packers jersey on 12/14 was phenomenal.  either way we didnt get the manager, didnt want to be disappointed.",

    "text": "It was my fellow Yelpers who convinced me to come here, and there's a lot I like about this place.  First, I like the design overall because it combines a little of everything. It is right off the casino floor, there's a two-sided bar with gaming machines, a neat dining room, a place to make sports wagers and a huge outdoor bar and patio.   Honestly, this is not your \"traditional sports book\" and is basically a window to make bets adjacent to the restaurant. They have a handful of high top tables reserved exclusively for sports book patrons, but I much preferred sitting elsewhere where you receive bar or table service.  A new manager named Drea took a ton of time to answer my questions one night, so I planned a return for the Sunday Night Football game and a bartender named Natalia also provided exceptional service and conversation.   There were a couple beers on good specials for the game and they went well with my Manly Burger, which was cooked perfect and served quickly. This burger featured a really high quality meat and I enjoyed how all the toppings complimented the meat, but did not dominate the overall flavor of each bite.   Others here on Yelp seem to question the size of the burgers for the price, but I do not. Sure, I can find a bigger burger at a better price somewhere else, but couldn't that be said about virtually any food/restaurant if you really think about it?  This would also be a fun place with a small group if you can get one of the couches surrounding a coffee table that is set up like a living room in front of the televisions. The outdoor patio is another good option with how they set up the tables and the bar outside is very long with plenty of additonal seating.   Oh, and it is significantly louder inside than outside. So pick your noise level accordingly.  On a lighthearted note, way too many servers and bartenders were wearing Seahawks jerseys. I'm just guessing most of these were purchased within the last year unless Umami Burger imported 25% of their employees from the state of Washington. If it looks like a bandwagon, it usually is one.",

After fifteen minutes of being bounced around (five minutes of being on hold then transferred to the concierge only to be transferred back to UB only to wait for another five minutes then bounced back to the concierge only to be told I had to be transferred back to UB then waited another five minutes to have the operator hunt down a manager and relay back to me that the manager said they don't take reservations... I guess the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing and they have False advertising too. They must not want the business of a large local group. If I could give zero stars, I would. Why do they even bother writing in big orange letters to call the number on their website to make a reservation if they don't take reservations?",

I wanted to make sure that there was some sort of substitute for any of the non-vegan sauces for the burger, I'm fine without vegan cheese. The hostess confirmed the burger was vegan and they could leave the cheese off to make it fully vegan! Awesome!!! Went down to eat, asked the waiter and they said the bun isn't vegan, so they could just do a lettuce wrap... lol. Imagine paying $20 for a burger wrapped in lettuce when you're on vacation and not in LA. I let them know about the misinformation the hostess had given us and they said they would let her know but come on, y'all. The other places that had vegan options were closed, so we were out of luck.",

The Umami burger is TO DIE FOR honestly haven't had such a good burger in my whole life! Fries were okay.  The salad was great too! Has a kick of wasabi that didn't hit you too hard at all.  HOWEVER, the mozzarella sticks were... An embarrassment. The marinara sauce was of lower quality than Little Caesar's pizza. The sticks would fall out of the breading when you ate them so you'd be left with empty carcasses of breading (which weren't worth clearing the plate). The breading was also way too hard and make it feel like I was trying to crack open a coconut just to get to the cheesy goodness.  Everything else on the menu was amazing so I just don't understand why those sticks were even on the menu. It's almost disrespectful to the rest of the menu to keep those on there with the rest of the food which was amazing....  All in all great place to eat. Just very confusing to start with low quality mozzarella sticks in a great fusion place called \"Umami\" burger.",

We seated ourselves and then sat there for almost 15 minutes waiting for the waitress to acknowledge us.  We ordered 2 drinks, and shared a umami burger and maple bacon sweet potato fries.  Underwhelming to say the least.  I've always wanted to try this burger and coming from the East Coast we don't have this restaurant there.  Not missing anything.  The hamburger itself tasted freezer burned.  Not fresh at all.  The tomato jam or ketchup was a gloop of inedible grossness.  Even the fries were yuck.  Waitress never came back to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything.  Other burger places in Vegas, sad I wasted my $ on this one.",

Sadly this time the burger was not the same it was juicy but was lacking flavor and it's hard to describe it but the meat tasted extra chewy and to make a long story short I only ate a quarter of my burger because it just wasn't right. Im not one to ever complain or send things back unless I'm acknowledged by my server that something is wrong which my waitress did not. My boyfriend only ate half of his because he felt the same way about the burger. Which if you don't know you ONLY get the burger it doesn't come with fries and it's $11! This is usually fine because the burgers should be bomb dot com like they usually are, but when the burger is crappy with no sides I feel your waitress should see there's a problem. We paid our bill and left and within an hour my boyfriend and I were super super sick and had a terrible case of food poisoning for a complete 24 hrs from their burger!",

It made me wonder if I was having a True umami experience.  Our server was wonderful. She was the only server on Christmas eve, and you could tell she was working hard. Kudos to her.  I had one of the truffle burgers and tempura onion rings. The burger comes out looking visually stunning. I enjoyed eating it until about halfway through. After that, the truffle oil felt overwhelming and I didn't want to finish it. The tempura onion rings were huge and so light tasting. They were delicious with the house ketchup.  I'd give umami burger another chance, but maybe not this particular one.",

I would come back however, I would just drink water or soda cuz the alcoholic drinks are too expensive.   It prolly was busy but the waiter was neither nice or rude. She was basically doing her job.

The service overall is mediocre at best.  It took a good minutes to get my cider and my boyfriend's beer, and the server did not stop by very often....but at least we were not forgotten about again.    The food is delicious!  This is the place I do not mind paying a bit more for a burger.  The truffle burger is by far my favorite.  It is very juicy and flavorful.  The bun they use is perfect and it does not get soggy with all of the cheese!    While the service still needs improvement I will definitely be back for the yummy food.",

However Vegas has a great rep for taking restaurants, franchising out to the strip and poorly executing it. I ate here and paid 14 for a burger and 6 for some fries. Price to me isn't a huge deal however to me the meal was not that great. The burger had no flavor, the fries were alright. However there are way better places you can go for a good burger on the strip.   I will say that I usually have a bad experience with female servers and my server a bubbly blonde if I remember correctly, did however make the meal quite pleasurable. She was a great server and I will note that.",

For $25, that seemed like a steal! My friend and I both ordered the truffle burger, complete with truffle fries (clearly we were indulging). The burger was cooked to a perfect medium, per my request. The burger was delicious! Thankfully, the truffle flavoring wasn't overpowering (some restaurants tend to go truffle-crazy). Presentation of the burger and fries was very clean and minimalistic.   It's been a couple of months since my visit, and I can't remember what we ordered to drink (may have been due to drinking beforehand). However, I do remember that they were off of the specialty cocktail list--and they were amazing!  I will say service was pretty slow, but our waitress was very apologetic and nice. There was a larger party being tended to at the restaurant, causing a bit of a lull in the arrival of our food and drinks. Considering I was on vacation and not in a hurry to go anywhere, this certainly didn't detract from the overall experience.",

    "text": "The ketchup tastes like it is very fresh and made by scratch, their jalapeno ranch dressing is tasty, not too spicy. The beet salad was excellent. My boyfriend got the original burger and I got the manly burger.  I ended up sending mine back because I don't like the fondue type of cheese that came on it... Nor did I like the bacon lardons- they are too thick and not as tasty as real bacon. I was frustrated... I just wanted a bacon cheese burger with real solid cheddar cheese or solid pepper jack cheese on it. Unfortunately I learned that Umami does not have any solid cheeses. I decided the next best thing to get would be a Parmesan cheese crisp minus bacon lardons. The bun was cute with the U on it. At first I thought the burger quality was good but it just fell apart in my hands and started breaking... My boyfriend said it was because it was too juicy... Not sure but it made it very difficult to eat. I felt bad that I needed to send so many things back...   Even the diet Pepsi because it tasted flat. So I got iced tea but there was no sugar on the table and it didn't come with a lemon. Our server was sweet but way too busy to check on us enough, perhaps due to poor staffing. There was indoor and outdoor seating. I loved the open layout with couches, our booth was comfortable, there were televisions everywhere for the sports fanatics.   The sweet potatoe fries were a little too sweet, like they had excess sugar on them. I am a sweet potato fri expert:)  Conclusion is that Umami in my opinion is better than a fast food burger but nothing compared to Hook (located in Woodland Hills). I thought Umami would be very similar in quality compared to Hook. If Umami used a pretzel bun my burger never would have fallen apart. If they used solid cheese and plane jane bacon I think they could accommodate more customer requests. I don't think I have extraordinary tastes when it comes to burgers.",

We got a great deal - a special package incl. unlimited draught beers and wings. Only reason I deduct a star - the wings were average, but I'm fancy so don't let that put you off! Tv's everywhere, good atmosphere, friendly staff, and free easy self parking. Great hospitality for local industry people. Thanks for the patron hangover Tony!",

They have portobello mushrooms for the meatless option.  I didn't try them but oh that sounded so good. I got the lettuce wrap.   We had tater tots for our starter (Ben suggested them).  They had these sauces you could try.  I fell for the Jalapeno Ranch. It wasn't spicy at all.  They're not on the menu, shocker. They should be.    I had the Hatch Burger $11, no bun but I cracked and had the bun on the side. It's a portuguese roll. I'm portuguese so I couldn't turn it down for a few little itchy hives. Besides it reminded me of home (Rhode Island). The bun wasn't overly sweet. It was just right.   Very filling. Locals should come here.  It's a nice sports book to grab a bite at the same time.   The bill came to $24.86, they took the tater tots & Pepsi off the bill. So we left a 32.5% because we felt the service was excellent.",

    "text": "It was my first time at Umami and I was surprised at the scene upon arrival - loud and totally packed with football fans.  I did not realize that not only is it a restaurant and beer garden but sports book as well - and we were there the first Sunday of the football season.  I'm not a sports bar type of girl - I enjoy watching sports but from the comfort of my own couch :p  And it was too loud for my liking.  We were reserved a table inside but were shown a table outside and allowed to choose whether to dine inside or out.  The only tables available on the patio were out in the hot sun, so back inside we went!  It was very loud in there, and it looked like my sister and I were the only ones there for the food and not the games, but I couldn't complain being in a room full of guys and the 49ers game playing on all the TV's :p  Service was good and the food even better.  I ordered the Manly Burger (fitting for the day we were there lol) which is basically a bacon cheeseburger with onion strings.  My sister got the Truffle Burger, and we split some Tempura Onion Rings and Truffle Fries (like we couldn't get enough of them in our burgers lol).  I liked all the food, especially the burger and the onion rings - soooo good!  I was afraid the burgers were going to be on the smaller side - they look like sliders in pictures - but it was plenty of food.  I couldn't finish it all.  We split an ice cream sandwich for dessert, the one with snickerdoodle cookies and salted caramel ice cream.  I like both snickerdoodle cookies and salted caramel ice cream but this ice cream sandwich was just \"meh.\"  Sounds great on paper but really not all that spectacular.   While the dessert was underwhelming, overall I was definitely not disappointed by this place at all, and while I wasn't too sure about the loud sports bar atmosphere it ended up being a fun time :)",

    "text": "I came here 3 times during my stay at SLS. My girlfriend and I sat at the bar twice and in the restaurant once.  When we sat in the restaurant, our server went on break in the middle of our meal and informed me someone else would be over to take care of us. A blonde girl walked by once and asked if we were ok and quickly walked away before we could even answer. We had finished our meal and were waiting for the server to come back over and deliver our bill/check in. In the mean time we went to the bar to gamble and grab a drink and our server still hadn't of come back. Finally I had to walk to the hostess stand and tell her I just wanted to pay since I had finished my meal over 15 minutes previously and wanted to leave. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like I shouldn't have to practically beg someone to come take my money. A server should be eager to get customers out, get a tip, and have that table sat again. From an operational standpoint, a restaurant shouldn't be sending servers on break when they have tables they are responsible for still, and throwing the table onto another unwilling server. The manger Jessica was very apologetic though and comped our food when she realized what had happened.  The food it's self was pretty good. I recommend the barbacoa nachos and pretzel. The Ice cream sandwich wasn't something I would recommend though. It was Ice cream in between a bun and not something I personally found appealing.",

I'll warn you on the truffle fries once  you start you cannot stop until you are scraping the cheese on the bottom of the basket. Service was very good. I would of gave this 5 stars except for the cost $30 for 1 drink and a burger seems very high. They get it and the place was full.

Fukuburger, Badger cafe, Burger Bar at Mandalay. These are all great burgers and all cost less. We ordered the \"Manly Burger\" and an order of fried pickles. S O asked for regular ranch instead of jalapeno ranch for the fried pickles. Waitress said \"we don't have regular ranch\". Ok, kinda odd at a multi million dollar new casino trying to impress but we carried on. The burger arrived and it was tiny! This is a freaking slider folks. The nerve of calling it \"The Manly Burger\"! Before I took my first bite I thought to myself for $14 this better be awesome for this price. It wasn't :( It was average at best. The fried pickles barely had any batter on them and tasted like warm soggy pickles. I got 5 pickle spears for $6! Come on guys, really? I have no problem paying high strip prices for a premium product (I.E. anything at the Wynn) but you gotta deliver a premium product. The waitress noticed we didn't eat the pickles and did take them off the bill.   Atmosphere was ok and the service was good. I just can't figure out why people would pay these prices for micro servings that aren't amazing.   General lesson for SLS and any other new business. You can't charge ultra premium prices and not deliver 5 star food and service. I have now eaten at Cleo, Umami and The Griddle and I wouldn't recommend them to anybody for now. As a long time local I want The SLS to succeed. We need jobs and great showcase properties. Come on gang, pay attention!",

Cheese like you get at the movies,  jalapenos from a can, fake tasting guacamole, overcooked bland beef, and canned beans that would have looked much more appealing had someone bothered to rinse them before putting them on the nachos.   I'd rather pay $20 for decent nachos than $9 for .....that.",

    "text": "I ordered a chicken Cobb salad. Probably the worst salad I've had in a long time. Hard chunks of bacon fat found only two small chunks of chicken in the whole salad. The wings were drenched in sauce and had too much breading on them. They looked like they came straight from the freezer to the fryer. Nothing screamed fresh about them at all. Being at such a nice hotel I expected more from here. I was surprised to find they do not carry a regular ranch dressing. Who doesn't carry such a basic condiment? The other two ranch flavors were not up to par for me. If the salad wasn't already a fail it was after I learned I couldn't get my dressing of choice. Drinks were ok and a nice place to watch sports, place bets, and relax. I will not cancel this place out because everyone else's food looked so good maybe I just made bad choices but u expect everything on the menu to be good. Hopefully when I visit again I can try something else and update this review.",

The burger's bun and toppings were good, but burger itself was small and lacking any real flavor, maybe overwhelmed by the toppings. At least was cooked properly. Fries were good, but not wow.

Atmosphere - This is a sports book/beer garden, and yet it was family friendly enough that I could have dinner with my 15 year old son.   Service - The waiter was very attentive and responsive, and even took the time to explain how the mechanics of the various different kinds of bets that were available on basketball, even though that's a separate company in the same space.   All in all, it was a very pleasant, tasty, and fun experience.",

My friends and I had a few  orders of wings, which were great. The sauce was really good, we also had some nachos which were amazing. When I ordered them I thought it was going to be an OK amount of nachos, but when we got them I was like \"Oh sh*t! That's a lot of nachos.\" it was a mountain of them. We also had some burgers which were pretty good too. All the food came out to us pretty quick, considering there were a lot of people there.   Drinks: We had that all you can drinks package which was pretty good, so it was worth it. Got to enjoy a lot of drinks while watching the game.   Service: Service was excellent! Food didn't take too long, neither did the drinks. Our server's was Eddie, I think. He was good, quick, and very nice, didn't take long to get our drinks. Always checked on us to see if we were okay with food, water, or drinks, which was awesome. The bussers (Joe and Eric) were real nice and attentive as well, we never had a bunch of stuff in the way because the bussers took everything we didn't need right away, so our table wasn't a clutter.   This place was really cool, I love the amount of TV's they have, they're literally everywhere. No matter where you turned you couldn't miss a part of the game. The vibe was real nice, and hype. Seemed like it was the place to be! Only thing that could have made it better would of been a win for the Seahawks! Will be back.",

I ate on the patio on my first visit - the Beer Garden (which is basically a let down of a name btw). I ate inside on my other visits. On all 3 occasions the staff were patient, attentive, offered great advice and even remembered us from prior visits.  My first visit I sat on the patio. It is referred to as the Beer Garden, but I can't figure out why. It seemed nothing like a beer garden to me. Seating consists of big huge picnic tables, which is great for large groups - a little strange for small groups. There are tons of big huge misting fans hanging, which help keep it nice and cool. My date and I shared the Sunny Side Burger, the Manly Burger and the Truffle Fries. The Sunny Side was by far my favorite, I can't generally pass up a fried egg on my burger. It was big, flavorful and worth the $14 price tag. The Manly burger was good too, lots of onion straws - but I don't think I'd order it again. The Truffle fries were TO DIE FOR! Shoestring thin, covered in truffle cheese but not soggy - perfection! If you like truffle you must try them!  My second visit I sat inside. There is a variety of seating, from big plush booths to leather arm chairs and sofas. It's what some might call a sports bar, but really it's a sports book! You can watch the games and bet on the sports, all while eating or enjoying a beer or cocktail. I had a Caesar salad with Grilled chicken. It has anchovies, which are optional - but I usally like that. The meat portions however were very small (my date had the same salad with Salmon) and the salad was just ok, maybe because it is kale, not sure why, but I didn't love it. I didn't finsh my salad and I definitely won't order it again.  My third visit I had the nachos with beef. The beef was shredded and marinated, it was amazing! There was plenty of guacamole which I appreciated. Strangely though the salsa came on the side and the cheese was a sauce, not real melted cheese so that was a big let down.  I will totally eat here again, but I don't think I'll branch out beyond the burgers, fries and beer next time however. Stick to what they are known for!",

I'm honestly not sure what happened in the 3 months that it took me to come back, maybe my palate changed? That and perhaps the service... no, the service definitely changed.  I'll start from the beginning. On my second visit to Umami, we had originally wanted a booth but were told that three guests were waiting ahead of us (still unsure how that one booth remained empty during our time at Umami)... we were also told that a private event was being held in the Beer Garden so we couldn't enjoy the nice weather either. We ended up taking the table that they offered us instead. The table was in the middle of everything, it seemed. Not only that, but in one of the more crappy locations to view the TVs. TVs were important during this particular visit considering that football was on. This table was also the table of a server who was either swamped or due for a break.   A host dropped some water off for us but it took about 15 minutes for someone to actually greet us and take our drink order. We had ordered chips and queso to start, pretty simple. The chips and queso actually arrived before our beers. Chips were pretty bland, not sure what exactly I was expecting out of chips, but they were that bland that I feel the need to address it here, ha! The queso was also lacking some flavor. I was pretty hungry though so I gobbled it down mindlessly.   The burgers were the main thing that we came here for. We had found a Groupon that offered dinner (a burger and a side) for two ($40 value) for $25... yeah, not really worth getting at all. The burgers were tasty, per usual. This time around we ordered the garlic and parm fries... they were simply okay. It would have been nice to have the parm cheese melted... but it was not. Simply sprinkled on top; the fries weren't even warm enough to melt it.   My biggest gripe this time around was the Groupon situation... the deal said that it was a $40 value but they split the bill and only applied $25 to our bill! We basically just went through Groupon to pay $25 of our bill. What in the world? The server was nice about explaining that the deal was specifically for 2 burgers and 2 sides, and I understand that it was out of his control. Seriously though, Umami? Why list that you're getting a $40 value for $25 when you're really just getting $25 for $25? LOL!   Overall, the service ended up being ok, after we finally got a chance to put our order in. The food was ok, nothing stellar like our first experience. This place has potential to be awesome (again)... just gotta go back to whatever it was they were doing 3 months ago. :)",

The service was friendly and attentive, that was good.  The menus were crisp and well-laid out.  The selection of beers, however, contained a lot of superfluous, turgid descriptions of trash beers like Miller or Bud Light alongside a raft of garden-variety beers you see in just about every bar in America.  There was a small selection of higher-grade rarities, but the premium charged for these was laughable.  Also, the souvenir beer bong thing you get for $24 is a plastic lip-murdering beast that is best left behind.",

Megan L. was our server and she was wonderfully sweet and a great server! I had the Sunny Side (which is pictured) and I am telling you right now, this is a burger you want to have! My hubby is more of the veggie/white meat lover and went with the greenbird. Both were so scrumptious and we swapped back and forth. Add a side of truffle fries and two cold beers, pure bliss!",

Then we do order, food comes, our beers are finished .... 20 minutes later - still empty beer we flag down another server to get our check and that takes another 5 minutes. My biggest irritation is that she lost revenue for the restaurant and thats not the person you want on your team.  Food was OK, I wouldn't go back.",

In n out burgers are better, and cheaper.  Chicken fingers from US Foods doesnt cut it either when your paying 12 bucks for frozen chicken fingers.  Truffle \"fondue\" didnt even taste like truffle but more like swiss cheese, and came out cold.  But you can charge more when you put the word truffle on a menu...we came here cause a friend was stayin ast the stratosphere so it was convenient..but never again.

We were told that it was only good for Rolling Rock... which is fine if that is what you like.  However, the hotel coupon did not indicate the beer type was limited to Rolling Rock so I was somewhat disappointed. I also tried using yelp for a free beer and we were told we would have to spend $40 to use both the yelp and hotel coupons.  When it came time to pay, they gave us credit for both coupons (and I did not drink Rolling Rock). I had a burger and fries which did not sit well with me later in the evening.",

No, that is not True at all! She was very helpful and I guess I should mention the food. It was unique, in a very good way! The last time I ate there, about a week ago, it was filled with lots of TV's showing games, and one on some sort of Chinese station. I have no idea why. But trust me, you're going to love it, heck, you're going to like it for sure, well, it is OK, if you are into that sort of thing. :) Honestly it is better than any Applebee's, Friday's, and just about the same price. You also don't get to hear any clapping servers singing happy happy birthday, may all your dreams come True.... And ask for Karina, and let her know Paul said hi!",

The menu was a befuddlement of strange ways to make a burger. I picked a Cali burger but without the house sauce (careful due to egg allergy). It tasted weird, really...weird. The tomato was a glop (fire roasted apparently) and the onions were more like egg noodles - wet cooked strings.  I scraped it off and tried again but it still tasted weird. Megan, my attentive waitress, asked if everything was good. I expressed my opinion. Although I didn't like it I didn't blame the restaurant. Sometimes things just aren't to your taste. However my  surprise and delight the manager immediately swooped in, organized for me as close to a \"regular\" burger as they were able to construct - which was basically burger, bun, lettuce, raw onions. The manager also brought over a selection of sauces on the side. She asked if I like mustard. I said don't even go there I only like colemans. 3 minutes later she showed up with a side dish of English mustard! The new burger was much more to my liking.  So there you go - it's not my kind of restaurant - but that's no-ones fault. This place went above and beyond to make it as right as they possibly could. Epically amazing service.",

The burgers were AMAZING! My husband is a burger snob & thinks most burgers aren't that great. He said this was one of the best he's ever had, kids said the same. I had an awesome salad. The service was fantastic, friendly & fast, which we appreciated since we had a flight to catch. The manager stopped by for a bit & chatted, offered a few suggestions of other places to try.  Bottled beer selection is pretty decent, the tap beer selection not very interesting - given the absolutely massive selection of good craft beers around, they could get a few more interesting beers on tap.",

Sunny was our waiter and gave us excellent recommendations! We had the Manly burger ,the Greenbird burger and truffle cheese fries! All were stellar!!! We were so sad it was over when we finished. And have already decided to go back later in the evening to have it again. Lol! Sunny also recommended an AMAZING beer that wasn't on the menu. It was Samuel Smith's organic chocolate stout beer! Let me just say it's the best I have ever had! Highly recommend this place!!!",

Both times I've been here I've had to get the attention of a manager and complain about waiting and not being helped.

In a hurry, I looked up something nearby. This place was awesome!  I had the original burger medium well with the free order of truffle fries. The 3 sauces were great with the burger. My friend had the cali with the Korean sweet potato fries. The burger was juicy and mouthwatering even though it was medium well. I'll definitely be having it medium next time I visit. The truffle fries are to die for but the Korean sweet potato fries were lacking compared to everything else.  If you are a local nevadian you get 50% off Sunday. I recommend this place for a filling meal that won't break your wallet.",

Our meal was pretty decent, although we didn't order too much because we weren't hungry.  Not entirely your average sports bar food.  Some more adventuresome dishes.  Plenty of big screens, but surprised the crowd was pretty lame for a playoff game.  Maybe a bigger sport book with more gamblers would have juiced up the crowd.",

I only frequent Vegas for work purposes so I usually order Togo and take it back to my room. This last time it was nearly impossible to get anyone to help me. When I finally was able to get the attention of the bartenders I didn't even ask for a menu ,just gave my order and I was ready to pay. She put in the order and I waited 35 minutes before she even remembered I was there. Someone finally saw that my Togo bag had been placed on the counter and the ticket showed it had been ready for the last twenty minutes. She mentioned nothing of it, processed my payment and gave me the bag. I get to my room and the burger was ice cold. Had it not been for the fact that I had to be at the airport at 4am I would've brought it back. I simply tossed the cold turkey burger in the trash and considered my money wasted. Word to the wise, unless you're coming to sit and truly enjoy a hot burger at a table... Togo is not where they strive.",

Not to mention way over priced ! $5 for a soda. The burger was decent but nothin to rave about. There are too many burger places in Vegas that are much better and most cheaper.

As far as the food, generally excellent. The burgers are unctious and full of the namesake flavor sensation, which I'm not sure some reviewers get. Meat is ground in-house (which yields a much better texture than typical compacted rubbery ground beef). The fries are underhwelming. They'd do better to switch to a hearty steak fry, especially since \"manly\" is a recurring theme on the menu. Contrary to the fries, the onion rings are thick cut, not encased in heavy batter, and are among the best I've had.  Make sure you also have the Brooklyn Later, it's as winning as Nancy's service.",

The truffle burger is AMAZING! So juicy and bursting with flavor. If you like tater tots, order the cheesy tater tots. They're not on the menu though, they're a secret... Shhhh. My hubby and I agree the jalepeno ranch sauce is best with the tots. The other sauces are just ok. I took a star away, because online it said they weren't taking reservations until September 1st. But when we walked into the dining area, after about a 40 minute wait, all of the booths were reserved. The waitress  was nice though!",

We walked in past the hostess because she was busy chatting with her colleagues. We didn't where to head out so we ended up coming back to the front and letting her know we need to be seated. The service was good but slow bec the server took our drinks, while it took sometime to bring those drinks. The food took sometime to get out of the kitchen. When it did, it was really good. In addition to the deal, we ordered their fries selection and they were awesome. Their umami. Tigers are really flavorful with a good quality and size. Their bun is pretty tasty too. I would get that again for sure and their truffle fries.",

You receive a massive menu, of which, 1/8th is actually food and the rest, beers and drinks.  If you like different craft beer - may be a fun place to try. The food was good too. Burgers were cooked well and had good flavor. I don't care for ketchup or mustard on a burger and requested mayo, they have a garlic aioli instead, which was very good.  The truffle fries are good - but strong. Make sure you have some gum for after your meal. :) Our waitress was great and recommended the spicy sauce and house made ranch for the fries....both had a good flavor.  3 stars because while it was good, it wasn't memorable....not sure I would necessarily return if we found our way back to Vegas.",

    "text": "We were sat yesterday around 2:20.  The server came to ask for beverages.  We all ordered water with lemon as we really don't drink.  The disappointment on the servers face was evident because we didn't order alcohol.  My sister ordered coffee with cream and sugar.  No biggie we thought.  Drinks were delivered and food order was taken but no cream or sugar for the coffee or lemon for the water as requested.  I went to go ask an employee to send over a manager as we still didn't have cream or sugar after 10 minutes for the coffee.  Our server never came to the table to tell us there was an issue with the cream or sugar.  Apparently the manager had to go across the whole casino to retrieve cream and sugar (WTF???).  My sister didn't receive her cream or sugar until 2:35 with no explanation or apology from the server or management.  I had to get up from the table again to ask another employee for lemons as our server forgot!   Food was delivered in a very tacky way.  The food runner came to the table and auctioned off the Food.  Apparently Umami doesn't have position points so the runners don't know which guest gets which item.  So the runner stays in one position at the table and delivers the food expecting us to grab the plates instead of moving to the other side of the table and put the plate down.  Very tacky to stand in one area and attempt to deliver to 5 different people.  Most decent restaurants have the runners walk around the table and deliver to each customer.  I asked the runner for more napkins as we only had 1 each. The manager finally came around and wasn't really empathetic at all and didn't really seem to care that we received horrible service.  I told her that I am a local and work in the hospitality business.  I had to ask another employee again for napkins as they we're forgotten. The food was extremely average for vegas standards.  We were done eating and it took at least another 10 minutes for someone to come around, I asked for the bill.  The employees didn't start pre-budding the table until the bill was brought.  Normally pre-bussing is a given when everyone is obviously done and stacks empty plates on the table.  I guess Umami does it differently than every single restaurant I have worked in for 15 years on the strip.  By the way the manager never came back to ask about the food or say anything to us.  I felt bad about leaving a very crappy tip but we did receive the worst service I have ever had in Las Vegas.  I like the SLS but Umami sucks.  We were all extremely disappointed.",

Mandy, our server, made several sharp recommendations on our orders and they were all spot on. The food arrived warm and fresh and tasted very good. The big screens were very sharp/ had great resolution. I wish I was here on Sunday for the NFL.

I like a tasty basic burger - and I think sometimes - the more stuff they are piling on top - it's to disguise the fact that the basic burger itself is not very good.  I ordered the Manly Burger, and I just didn't really like it.  I removed the bacon lardons cause they are just too thick for me to find appetizing.  The cheese is more of a cheese sauce, kind of runny and hardly any flavor.  And part of their thing is there is no lettuce or tomato or onion or pickles.  I'd rather eat at Smashburger or even 5 Guys for a tastier burger.  I did try the Sweet Potato fries, based on other reviews - and they were pretty good. Also, nice that you can get a beer - quite a large selection, and I think mixed drinks too.   Our server was friendly and the food didn't take that long to arrive.  But the atmosphere here is also lacking, in my opinion.  It's like eating in the middle of a noisy sports bar - with TVs everywhere you look.  And if that's what you want - then that is great.  And then, also, with the Strip location - you are gonna pay way more than at any normal spot.  2 burgers, 2 sides, 1 beer, 1 pepsi, + tip: $50.00.",

The red IPA she suggested after I started with a Firestone IPA, was awesome.   It was a busy Sunday, and she was making drinks non-stop for all the waiters AND helping half the bar. I was really impressed by how flawlessly she handled it all. I'm used to bartenders in Vegas just wanting to up sell you and take your money, but here the staff is so friendly, and just seem interested in making sure you have a great time. Will definitely be coming back here for football on Sundays with Melissa!   Also, I've read some reviews about the burgers being too small? They are perfect sized, especially if you get a side of the amazing manly fries. They have so much flavor too! That's why most Americans are overweight, because they want to eat 3 serving sizes for 1 meal!",

They did not have a vegan or veggie patty, and to top it off, what they did have was a sloppy joe type or sandwich that was open. The menu stated \"vegan mix\" with lentils, tomatoes, and cheddar jalapenos and some other stuff. That's not vegan. Maybe the chef needs a refresher. Then I got my food it and it  had a creamy sauce on top, again, why does your \"vegan choice\" say vegan when there is dairy in it. I didn't want to complain because I was out on a birthday lunch, the environment was great. U can eat on the couch and watch sports, or sit at the bar. Service was ok. Fries don't come with your meal but burgers start at 12$!!! I found that crazy. Huge drink selection but nothing appealing. Maybe I'll consider going back once they update their \"vegan\" selection.",

The hostess opened the gate for us never greeted us and told us we needed to go inside to the hostess stand to get a seat outside.  We walked through to find a hostess to seat us outside, we then waited for another waiter to take our drink orders.  I received my drink 10 mins. after I ordered it and then the other drink came 10 mins. after that.  They were out of the first choice, had no ginger soda on hand. Ordered the signature burger,  you can't specify how you want your burger cooked. Our waiter just said it's a thin burger and it comes the way it's cooked.  We were never given any napkins or utensils and had to grab them from another table...we were told not to do that.  lol.  They had all these workers walking around doing nothing!  We had to move from our picnic table because of a smoker.  they didn't want us to use our free fry coupon because we ordered truffle fries, scolded us again for that... upon leaving the hostess opened the gate and we were herded out with no goodbye or thank you again!  I was warned by a friend that spent the weekend at the SLS,about the place;  thought I'd try it anyway.  I guess they don't want any locals, this is not a feel good place u-mami?",

Went up to the bar that was facing the casino because there were too many people at the main bar. It wasn't too crowded but I stood there for a minute while the douchey bartender flirted with the girls sitting at the bar and poured them free shots. He took my drink order, told me one price then charged my card for a greater amount. When I questioned him he rudely stated \"Well I guess I just told you the wrong price.\" After me expressing that this was not an acceptable answer he proceeded to say \"what do you want me to do, give you your money back?\" Then pulled a few dollars out of his wallet and threw them at me. Having been to the SLS in Beverly Hills, I was definitely not expecting this type of service. I really expected better and hope that they improve.",

It took at least 15 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us. After he finally did, taking our drink order seemed like an inconvenience for him. Sitting here at the bar for an hour and haven't seen him smile once. He ran out of fireball while pouring a shot and filled it with some generic whiskey to top it off. When he finally came around to take our food order, we felt rushed and once again like we were inconveniencing him. When I food arrived, my burger was rare and I thought that it was strange that they didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked. When the bill came, I saw that he had taken the liberty to put in how I wanted my burger cooked without asking me.  This sounds like a lot of complaining on my part but I work in the industry.

They do room service and all so we thought, why not? Let's eat and hang in the room. For some freakin reason, NO ONE answered! No one!! Hell, the operator was even lost to why they weren't answering. Took maybe 6x to finally get through to them but that's because the operator tried another extension. HORRIBLE.   When we finally got our order, which was disgusting and super oily, it was a mess. I feel like the person who delivered the food decided to swing the bag around hardcore and hit some random gambler on the way to my room with it.   We ordered:  Umami truffle - Decent at best. Simple expensive thing. $13 Manly burger - Regular...mediocre...a mess. $12 Truffle Especiale - The egg makes everything better. Like I said, everything looks like it got into an accident or shaken to death. $14 Smothered fries - This looked like puke and it was cold. I couldn't do it. $5? Truffle fries - I liked it. This was my fave thing. $5? Ice cream - Prepackaged, overpriced, CoolHaus ice cream. $7 per a small sandwich.  There was more, but these are the ones I tried.  BTW, they forgot our ice cream. Dude had to make a 2nd trip and he had attitude. Wow...   We ordered a lot, I get it... It also cost a lot. Cost over $100. Ugh... We should've just went to In'n'out or at least Bachi Burger.   This really upset me. I liked the place....but this location killed it. BAD.  Never again. Go to In'n'out or at least Bachi Burger for gourmet burgers instead.  Service - F- (Retrain the staff.) Price - D+  Food - D -  Ambiance - C   Overall: NO. Never again! 0 stars if I could. It's hard to wear my patience thin and this place definitely did.",

    "text": "I heard a lot of buzz around Umami this last year. Friends, yelp, and a whole slue of other people have told me how much their love their burgers. While I enjoy a good gormet burger, normally I find myself always going back to The Counter and calling it good because I have yet to find something to top that experience.   While Umami is indeed really good, I still do not think it takes the title of being top dog.   We were eating at the SLS and everyone wanted to try a new burger. We sat down in the heavy sports bar feel of umami because there are TV's absolutely everywhere just like a sports book. It took us a forever and a half to get served because of a mix up, but when we actually ordered everything was smooth sailing.   I shared a truffle burger and some sweet potato fries. I loved the truffle on the burger, the cheese, the patty being cooked just right, and the bun. It was just a little bit small for what I was paying I feel. I got the sweet potato fries because my girlfriend really wanted them. Normally I hate sweet potato fries, but these were not like other's I have had before because they had cinnamon sugar sprinkled on them. This must have been magic pixie dust because it made them go from something I do not enjoy to a plate of fried potatoes that I wish I was no longer splitting with someone else.",

Hard to find and the host was no where to be found. This wasn't that big of a deal but it was just weird. When we were seated the waitress we're wearing t shirts advertising the impossible burger but no one explained to us what it was and there wasn't any information about it anywhere. It also came with regular cheese not vegan cheese. This could all be overlooked but the $16 double impossible burger came out and my first thought was I thought it would be bigger. The burger was good but I was not even close to full and was really disappointed with everything but the taste.",

    "text": "SLS hotel's grand opening was today and while there were many restaurants to eventually try, a gourmet burger was what my mind and stomach were set on.   The wait for a table was a good 30 min. but this gave us some time to explore the casino.  The friendly staff took our info and we received a text message when our table was ready.  When we arrived, we had the option of indoor and outdoor seating.  We stayed cool inside.   The atmosphere is loud.  Half the room caters to the sports book where you can order food while catching multiple games on large plasma tvs or sit at the bar and have one of their specialty cocktails.  The music rolls in from the casino so you won't be making much conversation though without raising your voice.   Our server was very nice and accommodating, explaining the menu and the sauces, and making suggestions for us.  We opted to start with some fries as an appetizer which you can customize.  We had gravy and braised short rib on top.  Delicious.    We ordered the original umami burger and the truffle especiale. Descriptions on my photos, my wife and I decided the truffle burger was the better of the two.   Other non-beef options like ahi tuna and the green turkey burger will have me coming a second time at least to try those.   The one hiccup was that my wife had her burger (the original) ordered well, while I like some pink and ordered mine medium. The order came out switched so I had to give up a majority of my yummy truffle burger to her!  We were just too hungry to send it back! :)  Anyways, solid burgers and fries. 4 stars!  Will be back.",

The smells that are coming from the kitchen are amazing! They are also making me hungry. Originally I was only staying for a short while but the servers keep passing the bar with all these lovely treats.   I enjoyed my drink at the bar and I ordered a rum and coke. The bartender was even sweet enough to add a cherry to it too! The staff here are very friendly and pleasant. They provide such great service and have positive attitudes too. There is a lot of team work between the server and the bartender. A team that gets along provides a better atmosphere for all.   After another look at the menu I fell in love with the maple bacon fries. Who does not love bacon and now with fries. These fries were amazing and it is best to smother them in ranch dressing too! The serving of fries is so large that I could not even eat them all. The menu here for little treats is fantastic and a must try!",

Our server did come quickly to get us all something to drink while we looked at the menu.  However, after we got our food. We really never saw our server again until we got the check.  We never got refills on our drinks and we had to ask another girl passing by for a to go box.    Other than the service issue, we had a good experience. Enclosed is a photo of the menu. There's many different types of burgers to choose from. Yes, they are very expensive.  However, you are in Las Vegas, in a hotel restaurant. So that is the Norm.   Kamala and I both ordered the Umami  burger.  It's a vegetarian burger. It has a lot of bread with it, I found it to be really good and had cheese and lettuce on it. I thought it was great. I will order it anytime .  Our other two friends both ordered regular burgers. They both loved them. The fries and salad are extra, a la carte.  We ordered regular fries and sweet potato fries. There was more than we could finish, so that is a good value as well .  The food is good, worth a try.  It's located inside the SLS Hotel.",

I had the Nashville chicken sandwich it was pretty tasty nothing really special or big \"wow\" factor. My wife had the throwback burger she said it was ok again just s regular burger nothing special. We tried the mushroom fries they were interesting probably wouldn't get them again at $12 price point. We are staying at this hotel so we will probably give them another shot for lunch. Wouldn't come here to go to this restaurant but if staying at the hotel it's a convenient choice.",

I ordered the burger with the fried egg at rare. So good! It was so juicy and full of flavor and the temperature was perfect. We also ordered their calamari, it was so thick and in slices not rings. We were so surprised to how good the meat was. I thought it was gonna be chewy since it's so thick but it was delicious. I highly recommend this place.",

The interior seating area was empty and we wanted to sit outside where while it was hot out, they kept cool and comfortable with fans and water mists. There was no one behind the bar so we went back in to ask for a server and were told that they didn't have anyone working the space in spite of the number of people sitting there. We asked if the could make an accommodation and they wouldn't. We were told we could place a to go order, wait inside for it and then bring it outside.  If the restaurant had been even remotely busy I wouldn't write or post this but it was truly dead. We left.",

Pricy and since my good friend is a meat scientist and told me all about ground beef, I order my burgers well done. They brought out medium rare +.   After letting it sit a bit to cook more, it was pretty good. I could only eat half - good sized portion.  Sides are extra. Got the Brussels sprouts - they were VERY good.   They have two types of red wine, a Pinot and a Cab. Got the Cab. It's alright.  Service is slow. There were games going on, place wasn't very full.   Overall it's what I'd expect from a sports bar, but with Vegas tourist prices to match.",

Service was a bit slow and when we asked to split the check they said they had computer issues previously and basically didnt want to do it because it would take them 20 mins or longer. Finally a female manager said she would do it for us which was kind of them. They did however provide an ice cream bar for the bday boy. Just guess I expect more being in Restaurant Management for years this was just okay and wouldnt recommend for further reservations.",

We figured sitting at the bar would get us pretty quick service since that's been our result at other places. We sat for probably 10 minutes before anyone asked us for our drink order, and then our server left. Everyone else at the bar had attentive service, but we were blatantly ignored. I would've understood if the place was on and poppin busy, but there were literally only about ten of us seated.   The food was average. We shared a caesar salad, chicken fingers, and a pretzel. Pretty basic bar food.   I'm sure others have had positive experiences with Umami Burger, but this was honestly one of the worst service experiences I've ever had.

First of all, having a waitress who didn't know what a \"Manhattan\" cocktail was is a bad sign that they are hiring the worst of the worst to work there.  I ordered the Hatch Burger, and from the start when it came out, I was underwhelmed. The food looks a lot better in the photos, and frankly, the preparation of chopping the chills up -- with the seeds still in them -- shows they aren't aware of how to properly prepare a hatch pepper.   The burger was cold, and nothing about it was remotely hot. The meet had clearly been sitting out by itself, and then the toppings added to make the burger. My client who enjoyed eating there the previous night, also complained about the same thing.   Clearly the service is not up to par or consistent. Probably will not go back there again.",

We had the grapefruit beer! Delicious! Then the food... We went all out!!  Bavarian Pretzel 5/5 salty warm and perfectly cooked!  Tatie Tots (not on the menu) 3/5 I wanted them to be cheesier, if you can believe it.  Truffle fries 5/5 delicious skinny fries covered in truffle cheese!  Manly Burger 4/5 I have to admit I hate the name but i ordered it anyway! Bacon, cheese, onions! So good and juicy! The bun fell apart that is why it lost a point.  Truffle burger 4/5 truffle on truffle on truffle!!  I gave Umami a 4/5 because I was up sold on a shot a vodka which ended up costing $13 alone! So that was excessive but other than that I loved it! Great place inside the SLS.",

    "text": "SLS? Seriously Lacks Satisfaction.  This is no more obvious than at Umami Burger, destination for our latest foodventure. But foodventures are not always successful, as Umami (Japanese for something) would prove. When Mama R wanted a burger for her birthday, Emijandro and I found it as our opportunity to try the much talked-about burger spot at SLS and off we went.  My thoughts on SLS itself are... sub-par at best, but this review strictly focuses on Umami Burger, which we found along the wall fairly easily. Walking in, there was a very... recycled... feel to the place, which I thought was supposed to be an urban hipster sports bar vibe. But one glance at the CHECKERED FLAG CEILING ABOVE revealed they just gutted the NASCAR Cafe and didn't bother to redo the ceiling.  When we were seated, we were handed small, trifold menus. Mine was dirty.  Seriously, your F&B department could have printed a ton of those, but you're giving me a dirty one?  Maybe it was to hide the fact that the basic burger was $12. No fries. NO GAWDANG FRIES. **flips table**  I ordered the Manly Burger, without the beer-cheese (?) as I don't care for cheese on my burger. The (dirty) menu said it had \"bacon lardons\" on it. \"Ryan,\" you may be asking, \"what in the Sam Hill is a 'lardon?'\" I didn't know either, but it's somehow related to bacon, so I took the risk ($$) along with an order of Tempura Onion Rings ($) and water (HAH TAKE THAT CORPORATE MURRKA!). Emijandro ordered the Jose Andres Burger ($$$) and Mama R ordered the basic burger. Well, basic according to Umami's standards.  The burger is an art form. I know. I'm a burger connoisseur. A burger gourmand, if you will. Its art is found in its simplicity. A patty made out of some meat, toppings-a-go-go, and a bun. Delightful. But at some point Umami just made it all too fancy-schmancy. First off, lardons are apparently cubed bits of slab bacon. I suppose that's fine, but some thick strips of bacon are just as tasty and probably less expensive for the restaurant so they can lower their prices. Secondly, would have liked some barbecue sauce on this type of burger (also had onion strings), not their Umami Ketchup (Japanese for something ketchup), which really was just ketchup, nothing really different.  The burger was too pink for my taste -- apparently my waiter heard \"medium rare\" instead of \"medium please.\" Or he was just dumb or hated his job -- the service was unsatisfactory, he spoke too quietly for a sports bar atmosphere during the third quarter of Monday Night Football, and dropped items repeatedly  (fortunately not our food). When we could hear him, he was being pushy about us ordering dessert.  Listen, dude, I know you're supposed to upsell, but when my bill is already about $19, don't give me a look when we say no to dessert.  Which I could have gone for, by the way, because for that type of money, the burger was small. To be fair, I didn't leave hungry, but I didn't leave with that OMG NO MORE FOOD IT WAS TOO GOOD kind of feeling. It just left me with a general MEH. I shouldn't leave with MEH for $19.  A few positive notes: The onion rings were tasty, though I could have used a dipping sauce beyond the four tiny little ladles of sauce they provide, one being the Umami Ketchup (something ketchup), and one being HOLY CRAP MY BUTT WILL REGRET THAT TONIGHT kind of spicy.  Umami should be Japanese for \"overhyped.\" If you want the best burger on the Strip, it's still at Holsteins at The Cosmopolitan. Or stay off-strip and you can find a lot of high-quality burgers at a much lower price point. Either way, maybe SLS stands for Satisfaction Low, Sorry.",

Drinks as far as soda are pricey but they are imported from Mexico meaning no garbage chemicals they use in fountain drinks.

I was disappointed because they were not able to bring the correct beer. The first round was correct but after that they always brought the wrong beer. I mentioned it twice but they were not able to fix it. They made me pay for all beers. Not a good example of fixing a problem. Again this is convenient if you wanna get a quick bite while staying here. Holsteins has way better Burgers for sure.",

    "text": "We were tired, hungry and getting a bit jaded with flashy Vegas restaurants. We went to Umami because everything else in SLS was either closed or unappealing.  We were seated in a booth that was comfortable and immediately greeted by a refreshing friendly voice and face. Our waitress AJ was a breath of fresh air. She gave us plenty of menu advice and time. She was genuinely concerned with our enjoyment of our experience.   We didn't want to watch basketball on our booth TV. As soon as we let someone know we'd prefer hockey, the game was switched.   The food:  ahi burger - amazing!  Big, well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Throwback burger - solid traditional burger, substantial amount of beef and a very tasty bun. Truffle burger - just excellent, a wonderful grown-up mix of flavors.   A choice of three sauces plus house made ketchup is offered up to the table - these were a great compliment to everything we ordered including the tempura battered onion rings, cinnamon seasoned sweet potato fries and truffle fries.   Then there are the cocktail and beer selection. Amazing!  Try the Le Freak brewed by Green Flash!  I'll sum up the experience like this: this is the only restaurant in Vegas we went to twice during our trip. Loved the drinks, the food and especially the staff. Go there!",

When I asked the spiciness of a burger the server told me about the Diablo Burger, which isn't on the menu. It comes as a turkey or beef burger, with beer cheddar cheese, onion straws, diced hot peppers and Diablo sauce. I got the beef - it was very spicy but not some much that you couldn't taste the flavors, and it was delicious. I also got sweet potato fries which weren't very good, I got them with salt instead of the cinnamon sugar, that might have made a difference. My husband got the Parmesan fries which were just ok, the Manly Burger which he said was a really good bacon cheeseburger. The fries were a good portion and enough to share, I expected the burgers would be bigger but they were still filling. We used a Groupon for 2 burgers and 2 sides so this was a great bargain, as well as a good experience.",

I do have to say that while I didn't not care for my burger there were a couple others on the menu that I would still like to try. I opted for the Cali Burger. It had caramelized onions on it which I love but these were disgusting. I don't know if they made a huge batch of them early in the day & then just popped some on the burger each time it was ordered but they  tasted gross. They also made the top of the burger slide off in every which direction. Loved the truffle fries & the sweet potato fries. Tried the onion rings & while they were as big as a softball there was absolutely no flavor what-so-ever in the batter. Not even a little salt.Glad I hadn't ordered them. They were very accommodating to our party of 12 that included a child which technically they couldn't seat where they original sat us but did accommodate us by moving the sports book lines since there wasn't any one actually sitting in that area. Server was frazzled but she still did a great job.",

We were informed they would only be open Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday.  WHY?  Being local we love to go to the SLS at least twice a week, do a little gaming and have lunch at Umami.  The restaurant always looked busy, including the patio.  Apparently the hotel has new owners and no decisions will be made about anything regarding the hotel/restaurants until the deal is done. If you want to have lunch at the SLS there are now only two options, the pizza place and the cafe, neither of which appeals to me, my wife or our friends.  Guess we will have to find a new favorite hamburger place until such time as the future of Umami is decided.  Just an FYI, we do not go to the Strip on the weekends.  That time is for tourists. Hopefully the new owners will realize that locals can and do patronize the restaurants on the Strip.",

The food was packed nicely and I like that they brand their bun. This burger wasn't bad but didn't live up to the reviews. Although they paint a pretty picture with imagery with the description of the \"gourmet\" ingredients, they actually sound better than they taste. If you want a comparable burger (or better) that live up to the hype. Go to Fukuburger, Bachi burger-or dare I say-Fatburger. Yeah I'd eat fatburger before I eat here again. So overall not a bad burger, but waaaaay over-hyped.",

Aside from the crappy food, soda is served by the bottle (so be prepared to shell out $3 for each 12 oz bottle you drink).... and the real clincher: on top of the 20% gratuity they automatically added to the bill, they added AN EXTRA 20% SERVICE CHARGE simply for being a party of 6 or more.  Nope, sorry... never again!  Good luck surviving in SLS where the hotel smell alone made me want to vomit!",

    "text": "Too bad Umami is so far from Houston!!   Booked my hotel at SLS and a friend heard this place has really good burgers.  Turns out, it was fantastic!  If I ever run into another Umami Burger I am down to go in a jiffy! The place looked really nice, I think it's one of those places that take down bets and has those super huge screen to watch sports.  Waiters were fairly quick and attentive to us. We had: --Truffle burger (5/5) (added bacon) :D --Truffle fries (3/5)(didn't taste the truffle much, but it was still good) --Ahi Poke (2/5) (it was alright, wasn't that much of a fan)",

    "text": "I have never been to any Umami burger joints in LA, since we stayed at SLS hotel, there weren't many choices for lunch, I wanted some ice cold beer, so Umami burger it is.  Glad to see there are veggie appetizers, ahi tuna burger and vegan burger. That's all I can have on the menu. The Belgian draft beer I tried was pretty good, very tasty and strong. Had a glass Stella for second one, couldn't finish it, poured it in a plastic cup and took it back to our suite.   Appetizers: House pickled veggies, Thin fries.   The assorted pickled veggies were delicious, sour and salty, great hangover snack. They provided three dipping sauces for fries, the yellow jalapeno sauce was extremely spicy, loved it.   Burgers: Umami burger in medium rare and Vegan burger.   Hubby liked his burger alright, he said it was tasty but nothing spectacular for being their so-called signature burger. My sloppy mami was really\"sloppy\", it was open faced and impossible to hold, also hard to take a bite, the stuffings made the buns so mushy, tasted nasty, but the stuffings were very delicious, liked the onion strings so much.   Food was good but not great, portions were huge, our waitress was friendly and fairly attentive.   This place is great for watching sports on the leather couches in the mid section, a few enormous flat screen TVs hanging up high right in front of those seatings, those are for reservations only. A great way to kill some time in the afternoon hanging around here.   Unless we want to have drinks and watch sports, I wouldn't come again, just not my type of food.",

    "text": "Located in the SLS hotel and casino. When you enter, to the immediate left there's what seems like a fully stocked bar with usual gambling games. To the right of that a comfortable area with tables and couches to dine or watch whatever sports game playing. The high ceilings has a black and white checkered pattern. And to the right of that their sports book with a few tables and tvs. But wait there's more. Exit the doors and you'll enter their \"beer garden\" outdoor patio area with lots of seating, ping pong table, and an even bigger bar than inside.  The staff are very friendly and welcoming. They were patient enough to explain the items and what the concept of Umami Burger was each time.  They are supposingly a known business which I've never heard of and they prefer that you don't mess with the chef's creations and have them as is . It seems a like a place to hang out at and have some beers but I wasn't impressed with what I ate.   Korean Style Brat <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/umami-burger-beer-garden-and-sports-book-las-vegas-2?select=EXZKbmaYdCoXrn7spPRf-g#EXZKbmaYdCoXrn7spPRf-g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/umam...</a> It looks great but I probably won't order it again. It was a pork belly brat topped with caramelized kimchi, their korean ketchup, sesame aioli, and green onion for $11. The pork belly brat was sliced like a hotdog bun it was thin and tiny in proportion to the other components.  It was like eating a bun filled with just caramelized kimchi. The caramelized kimchi was kind of nasty tasting for me, maybe too caramelized not sure but I needed lots of water just to finish it.   Manly Burger <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/umami-burger-beer-garden-and-sports-book-las-vegas-2?select=61-9mqfYzG0SuuOpy7DuNw#e-XzbnWpPTFtb9y9GM93FQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/umam...</a> Their burger topped with beer cheddar, bacon lardons, smoked-salt onion strings, their house ketchup, and mustard all for $12. I don't know if I liked too much. The manly aspect wasn't there unless manly meant tiny. It was like an over sized slider.  I would've preferred the onion strings to be crispy. The U on the bun was nice.  Also had the Truffle Fries. Thin fries with truffle cheese and truffle salt. Didn't like it maybe try the manly fries or something else next time. The fries were cold and were all stuck to each other.   I've had way better comparable food for the price in Vegas. I was expecting something on the line of Bachi Burger or at least better than 1/2 of the numerous burger places here but got something far far from that. Other than that I like everything else about it the huge misters, decorations, the bar, the many TVs, customer service, the outdoor patio with view of the Strip and people walking or driving along the Strip which is why I didn't give them a 1 star.  I might be back.",

    "text": "I'm not a fan of Umami when I tried it a few times in L.A. years ago. My sister has never been and I can't say no to a free meal with family. You have to reserve a table (what?) or open-seating at the bar. I'd much rather stay at home and do homework than be here but since my sister already went out of her way to reserve a table, I showed up anyway.  Random thoughts: their house ketchup tastes like Filipino spaghetti; you only get 3g or protein per 100g (1 cup) of mushrooms which does not meet my protein needs therefore, I must stick with beef patty; I have low expectations of Umami Vegas thanks to Umami L.A.; Umami beer garden???; Umami buns look huge but press to deflate; they'll give you 4 different sauces: 1 spicy, 1 ranch, 1 garlic aioli that doesn't taste like garlic at all and house ketchup.  The Original: House ketchup, parmesan frico, shiitake mushroom, roasted tomato and caramelized onion. The frico adds crispness to an otherwise boring burger. 3/5  The Royale: Braised short rib, truffled aioli and truffle cheese. Again, not truffle-y enough. The short rib was a nice touch. 3/5  Truffle Burger: Truffle cheese, truffled aioli and truffle glaze. Sounds like a lot of truffle but it sure didn't taste like it. It had a hint of truffle and that's it. 3/5  Truffle Fries: I've had way better truffle fries elsewhere. The fries were soggy and lacked truffle flavor.  Get the smushed potatoes instead. 1/5  Sweet Potato Fries: Sprinkled with sweet salt. This goes well with the spicy dipping sauce and the house ketchup. 3.5/5  Mies Vanilla Rohe: Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream in between chocolate chip cookies. The cookie itself wasn't that great. The ice cream was ordinary. Hello, cavities! 2.5/5  At least in L.A. I've gotten better service, food was a bit quicker and my drink glass was never empty. Umami is a casual dining place but calling it a sports bar/beer garden and having that atmosphere is just blah. Flat screens everywhere with different football games on and Criminal Minds = headache! There are other better burger places in Vegas.",

    "text": "Umami:  noun a category of taste in food (besides sweet, sour, salt, and bitter), corresponding to the flavor of glutamates, especially monosodium glutamate. ???  I wasn't sure what Umami meant, so my assumption was that this was going to be an Asian fusion burger. Nope, this is just a straight up burger with truffle oil randomly thrown in the mix. C'mon, you were thinking the same thing when you heard the name, \"Umami Burger\".   I came here with some friends and we started this meal off with a cornucopia of deep fried, carb loaded appetizers, Mmm Mmm my favorite. First up, the \"Smushed Potatoes\" these were ok, but a tad flavorless. They look like a mini-baked potato and be careful when eating, I tried putting a whole one in my mouth and nearly lit my tongue on fire. These little pockets of heat are best cut in half and dipped in Umami house ketchup, which I liked a lot. It's ketchup, but with a mix of truffle oil and something spicy. We also ordered sweet potato fries and tempura fried onion rings. The sweet potato fries were cooked perfect, crispy and soft and the tempura coating on the onions was light, flaky and not too heavy. Overall, deep fried goodness.   On to the star of the show. I ordered the Truffle Burger, the hat trick of truffle oil infused beefy eats. This burger has; truffle aioli, truffle cheese, and coated in a truffle glaze. This burger was super juicy and full of flavor and honestly didn't need any sauce assistance, but I still dipped it once or twice in a mixture called, \"Diablo Sauce\"? Plus the bun was super soft, like dissolving in your mouth soft. Cute side note, they adorn each bum with the letter, \"U\" which in the words of Ralph Wiggum stands for, \"Umm-believable\". After the burger entered the equation I completely forgot about the side dishes and went full carnivore.   To finalize the meal, like any good eater, we ordered and shared a dessert. This was an Ice Cream Sandwich. A snicker-doodle cookie with caramel ice cream filing. Sooooo good, a must order!   - Was this the best burger I ever had? Nope.  - Was it tasty and satisfied me? Yes - Would I come back? Maybe. Every once in a while.   Umami is good, but the prices are a little high for a burger place, but If you haven't been here yet it's definitely worth a try if you're any kind of burger loving American.   Cheers.",

    "text": "I had heard a lot about Umami Burger from friends and relatives from California. So I was, naturally, excited to hear that there would be a location inside the new SLS Casino.   We had a party of 5 of us this past Sunday evening. We had the option of having a table or booth, so we opted for the booth. I was diggin' the layout of the space. It is attached to a William Hill sports book, so there were plenty of TV's around playing football(including in our booth!). You can NEVER go wrong with me by having football on the TV!  The service was outstanding! Our server, Mandy, was both personable and engaging and helped us with recommendations(including my tasty Stella Amber!). Our party ended up trying a little bit of everything. First we ordered appetizers of fried pickles and \"manly\" fries. I didn't partake of the fries pickles, but those fries were delicious! I had the classic burger, while my friends had the B.U.B. and the Truffle burgers. They all ranged in price from $12 to $14 each. The burgers were juicy and tasty. My only complaint would be that they were a bit on the small side.  It wasn't until after we were finished that we walked out to the patio facing the strip and took in the Beer Garden. Looks like a very cool set up and I do look forward to coming back and trying out some more menu items!  This was a pleasant experience and we will certainly be back once things calm down a bit at the SLS...  so I have to give it..  4 stars!",

My friend had the Cali burger and she says it was totally worth it. Another friend for the nachos and she wasn't impressed, but she doesn't like beer and supposedly the cheese is beer infused. Last dish ordered was the chicken Cesar salad and she says it was good. Nothing as great as the ahi air the burger. Yum!! Also dairy free burgers. They melt in your mouth.",

Although the place wasn't packed for lunch, our waiter was a bit scarce at critical moments: Like after we were seated.  And after the great food was delivered and it became apparent extra napkins would be needed.  And when drinks were running low...  The burger I had was excellent- both flavorful and juicy. Price points are a bit higher due to being a hotel/casino restaurant, but by no means outrageous. Will hit this place again next time staying here.",

My group had 7 people so we were told beforehand that we would be charged addtl. gratuity which usually I don't mind but when we received the bill I saw that we were charged 20% which is ALOT! especially when the server freaking forgot our umami fries even though I checked with her twice that I had put in 2 orders of umami fries.   I ordered the umami especiale truffle burger, and we also shared the umami fries, fried pickles, and sweet potato fries.  I especially love the ketchup that they have here, it is the only ketchup that I will eat.  The sweet  potato fries and fried pickles weren't particularly worth it, since they only give you 6 spears of pickles for $6 so $1 per pickle wtf.   Service just took way too long, and it was pretty obvious the staff did not know what they were doing. I wouldn't mind the price for this restaurant if only the burgers were a little bigger.  I usually cannot finish an entire burger but at Umami I always can.   P.S. ONLY umami with a full bar.",

Lacked flavor  Hatch burger - nicely seasoned  Cali Burger - OK  Mint cookie ice cream sandwich - refreshing, chocolate cookie was warm and soft. Mint ice cream was nice n minty  Peanut Butter Ice cream sandwich - Too peanut buttery for my taste  Service was great. Very attentive with good recommendations. Food was just ok to me.

Umami Service & Ambiance:  The decor is sports influenced nascar (?) influenced as evident by the hanging football helmets and the checkered flag ceiling.  There's plenty of booths and tables in the open main dining area.  Flat screens are hung throughout the resto. The hostess at the front was very friendly as she directed my friend and I up the handicap access ramp.  Our server was friendly but it looks like they were understaffed as we didn't really see her through our visit.  She was making her rounds and trying her best it appeared  Umami Burgers+: We started off with the duck fat cauliflower and it was the perfect flavorful light appetizer.  This is a very creative dish.  The Yelp bff went with the Sam's Crispy Chicken and it was juicy and savory.  Truffle everywhere as I went with the truffle Burger & the truffle fries.  The thin truffle fries were on point and tasty.  This was a fantastic truffle burger: truffled aioli + truffled cheese + truffle glaze.  As much as I want to try a new burger on the next visit, I feel like I'm going to order this again.  Severe first world foodie problems.  I have a feeling I'll be back here when the NFL season starts.  There's plenty of monitors, beers on tap and burgers I want to try.  See ya at the bar, cheers!",

It's \"seat yourself\" however, no one was really tending to the floor.  Food was the same, about 4 stars if I were to rate it. Had my manly burger medium rare with truffle fries.  My card took about 15 min to come back after having given it to the server. The gentleman who finished at the same time at the table next to me got his check, paid, and was out quite a bit before me.   Came back a day later so I could get lunch and work out of my hotel room. They charged me for sauces this time, where as yesterday, they did not. $0.50 per sauce. Ketchup is excluded from this. Not sure if it's because of to go or not, however it seems to depend on who is helping you.  Sit at the bar if you want to be served quickly and efficiently, but it seems as though the bar's standards and requirements are much more different from that of the floor. Checked my ID twice (once to be seated, second time to pay). Charged for sauces.",

They are located inside SLS, so it was convenient to just eat here for lunch. We were all starving and got different burgers without planning on it. I ordered the umami burger and thin fries for the table. The others got the sunny side burger, spicy jalapeno burger, truffle burger, and the ahi poke nachos.   Service was pretty quick, so everyone was happy. Everyone enjoyed their food, except my friend who ordered the ahi poke nachos. They were okay, but since they are known for burgers, I'm not surprised. She tried a bite of my burger and liked it. The fries were thin and very tasty.   The burgers were expensive for how small it is. You can eat a whole one without being too full. I like how flavorful the meat is though. I'm glad I don't have to go to Vegas if I want to eat this again. They have many locations in LA and Anaheim as well.",

I was expecting a fancy sit down high end burger place. While the burgers were delicious enough to be on any high end burger spot, the atmosphere was very much like a sports bar. Plenty of large TV's with Audio. Personal TV's in the booths and a sports-book inside the place.   Two burgers, tot nachos, and fries came out to just under $50. Super filling and good portions for the price.   The burger patties were thick and meaty. The cheese on both burgers was super delicious and they didn't skimp with a thin slice of cheese. They melted it all down the burger. Super delicious. They even paid attention to the ketchup which was spruced up with what I think was truffle something.   Definitely on par or better than every high end burger spot in town. Coupled with being a great place to watch any game and I will 100% be back. Highly recommend you check it out as well!",

The burger itself was very flavorful and worth the price but ok priced for vegas. The bartenders were very nice and accommodating.   Highly recommend this place at the SLS.",

The onion rings were good, but the burger was just so so. The meat was okay (nothing to write home about). After all, the burger is about the meat. The bread was okay..maybe if it were a bit toasted it would have been better.  I always get the sauces on the side, as many places have a tendency to use too much sauce, thereby overpowering the flavor of the meat.   All in all, not my favorite burger. The price was also outrageous. $25 and change for a burger, onion rings and a Pepsi? Definitely not worth it.",

After our meal all 5 of us thought the food was ok but not great. The best part of the meal were the fried pickles which were done in a way I had never seen. The burgers were ok but under seasoned and the condiments all had something different added to them (ketchup and bbq sauce, ranch and jalapeno) which changed the flavor of the burgers and fries. I think there is a lot of potential here with the menu but there just needs to be more flavor.",

As people began to show up , our waitress Mandy , and the restaurant manager were more than friendly and accommodating . As time went on over 40 people showed up , and Mandy was our only waitress. I've got to give major KUDOS to this girl!!! She was awesome , and believe me she ran her ass off taking care of the party . She did get help from the manager and kitchen server . All in all we had a great time . Mandy kept a smile on her face and never showed signs of frustration, impatience , or exhaustion . She kicked ass ! Thank you Mandy , and the staff at Umami for making our farewell party fun and running smooth . The food was awesome, and it was a good time for all.",

    "text": "Not sure why this place got such low stars but I think it's pretty awesome.   Their Impossible Burger is my absolute favorite. I'm not a vegan, but I love trying new vegan and vegetarian food. This is definitely THE best non-burger burger I've ever had. It's amazing how much it tastes like a burger. I'm not sure what voodoo magic they do to it, but it's impressive. If you or a friend are a non-believer in meat substitutes, this is a burger to change your mind. If you're still unimpressed, it's safe to say veggie burgers are not for you.  Their regular burgers are really good too, although whenever I come here I always just get the Impossible Burger. I mean, you can get a regular burger anywhere else. But if you come with a friend, have one of you get the regular burger and one get the Impossible Burger. Then you get the best of both worlds, like Hannah Montana.   The service is really good too. I often like to make modifications or special requests of my orders and the staff has always been accommodating. Also any burger can also be lettuce wrapped if need be - although their bread is pretty good!   The only downside is the menu is a little on the pricier side. My recommendation is to sign up for an SLS card. Even with a little bit of a gambling, you should be able to easily get a $10 dining coupon once a month. My husband and I each have a card and that's how we fund our Impossible Burger habit. Don't forget SLS also does a $30 off $60 purchase on the month of your birthday too. And with a $60 threshold to meet you can really go to town then!",

For a 35 minute wait and having to sit out in the heat (even though the were many empty seats inside) the food was not worth it.   I guess they don't realize how many great burger places we have in vegas.   Food quality I'd say was better then fast food, but just a bit better then In and Out burgers.  Compared to some place like Bachi Burger, this place seems average.  Our server was a sweet heart, but I think she was assigned to cover too many tables.  I felt bad for her because I could see her trying to give every one attention but just not being able to keep up.  She wasn't slow either. She was quick and accurate, but there were just too many tables.  I have to imagine that the LA location must be better then this.",

Not too many places give out nice little extras for locals, let alone point it out to them. Very much appreciated the quality service from hostess booth to the table.  I got the choose-for-me combo with beer. For $22.50, you get an entree, fries, and a beer. After being assured I was not going to receive a Stella or Bud Light, I went ahead and gave it a shot. Was glad I did!  I received even more sweet potato fries (one of the apps we initially got, along with truffle fries and onion rings), which were seasoned just right with brown sugar and salt. The entree was the Hatch Chili Burger, and living around Carlito's Burrito's I love them and this burger! Was well cooked, chilis were well roasted, and the bun on the burger was just firm enough to hold things together, add some texture, but not get in the way. Finally, the complimenting beer was Old Chub Scotch Ale, a pretty good micro-brew. All in all, loved the pairing, and look forward to ordering the dining world's equivalent of the \"I'm feeling lucky\" button again soon.",

They will text you when your table is ready, which I think is cool.   Sat down, got the beverages in a pretty timely manner.  Fried pickles were tasty, full spears served with a garlicky jalapeno ranch sauce (too runny, but flavorful).   Then it just went downhill.    Our order of Cali Burger, Manly Burger and Manly Fries seems simple enought, right?   Well about 15 minutes after our pickle app, our fries arrived (very delish thin fries with beer cheese and bacon!).    Burgers should come out at the same time or shortly thereafter, right?   Waiting....waiting....fries gone... Have been there for an hour now....no burgers.  Got tired of waiting and just left frustrated.  Staff was apologetic, and Management offered to comp a full meal for us and our friends on the next visit, which I appreciate.   I'm not rushing to get back, maybe give it a month or more to iron out the kinks.",

There was only one thing on every tv, basketball. We were watching hockey, but before the third period started it was done.   I ordered a pear cider which was served luke warm with a warmer glass.   My husband got the ahi burger that he enjoyed more than my umami burger.  The garlic fries were not worth the title.   We waited 15 minutes to get the check, then twenty to process the payment.

    "text": "Terrible service, okay food, good drinks  Umami Burger is basically a poor man's Bachi Burger, or a dressed up overpriced burger where you over pay because it is on the strip.  Combine this with a total lack of competent service, and you're in for a disappointing night.  As to the service, SLS apparently stands for \"Style, Luxury, Service,\" but Umami Burger contorts that to \"Severely Lacking Service.\"  If you're local, eat at Bachi Burger before going to the SLS and you'll get a superior burger at better prices.    While I can appreciate that the restaurant just opened and it may be working out the kinks, the service was incredibly disappointing.  To top it off, a marketer for the restaurant went to the adjacent table to see if they were locals to give them information about local specials.  When we looked at her to catch her eye, she just looked at us, then ignored us, and walked away.  This was pretty much on par with the terrible service we also had from our server who had nothing but attitude and rarely came back to check on the table.  That said, the server was cognizant enough to smile and tell us that she hoped we had a great dining experience when she was dropping off the check.    Umami Burger, you just lost 8 customers who will never eat at  your establishment again.  From looking at the other reviews, it looks like you will be alienating your future customers.  At least you're consistent.",

Sunny helped us out and he was the most perfect server, a F&B operations manager can ask for:  attentive but not overbearing, quick but not clumsy, made cocktail suggestions for my cold (yes, I was drinking with a sinus/respiratory infection. #yolo)and THE BEST thing ANY server can do, which Sunny did with finesse, is to fix mistakes rapidly without making into a huge deal to draw attention.  I let my hubby order food choices for the both of us because I always end up eating his dish.  He ordered the Umami & Manly burgers, a side of sweet potato fries and the Beef Barbacoa Quesadilla.

A short menu of appetizers and burgers (duh) but much more extensive choices of beers, wines, shots and bombs. Try the Clover Bomb, subtle and easy.  The chicken fingers were sizable and fairly tasty and so were the burgers themselves.  I had the Ahi Tuna burger with a side of sweet potato fries. Other than a flavoring in the avocado,  I enjoyed it. They do offer a cookie and ice cream desert but I skipped it. For a December Friday night,  it was fairly tame in the restaurant & casino which was a plus.",

To me, truffle anything is a winner for me. Anywho, let me take you my adventure at Umami Burger at the SLS hotel.  The Umami Burger is combined with the Beer Garden and Sports Book. A dream combo for any beer fan and sports fan. With wide screens all over the place, this is definitely one of the casual hang out spots at the SLS hotel. Our server arrived promptly and explained the whole menu to us. This was my first time eating here, and if any server explains the menu to me, they are off to a good start. Two burgers that caught my attention was the Truffled Burger and the Jose Andres Special Burger. For those that are unfamiliar with Jose Andres, he is the culinary superstar chef behind the world-known Bazaar. A hint to all is that if its a Jose Andres creation, it certainly worthy to try out. Along with the burgers, we also ordered fries...truffled fries of course. The neat thing about this 3 hit combo establishment are the beers. Most places will have the typical everyday beers you can find from the supermarket. This place surpasses all of those expectations. This place has craft bottle beers and even beers that Ive never even heard of.  Beers are out, fries are out, burgers are out. Everything tasted great, service was prompt, and the dining experience was great!  If your low on a budget and want to eat something casual a the SLS hotel, lets this be your number one go to spot.  UNTIL THEN!! ^-^",

It would be a great place to watch a game and grab some food.  Our server was super friendly and we got our food very quickly.    I ordered the Sloppy Mami, a vegetarian sloppy joe.  It was served open face and was piled high with lentil sloppy joe mix and topped with fresh slices of jalapeno.  It was absolutely DELICIOUS!!  The texture was great, the bread was soft and the flavor was rich and perfectly spiced.   We ordered a side of onion rings.  OMG the onion rings were scrumptious!  They were huge rings with a nice, flavorful, crispy coating.  They brought out a variety of dipping sauces which I thought was a great touch.  I would seriously go back for the Sloppy Mami again.",

The space is nice and large and our waitress was awesome - absolutely lovely, fast, and accurate.  The menu is rather limited and healthy options do not abound. The chicken lettuce wraps were rather lackluster - pieces of chicken and mushroom slobbered in ranch dressing and covered in a mountain of fried onions.  No intrinsic flavour to speak of.  According to my husband, the Cobb was decent and the fries were good, but were served in a porcelain bowl that assured they got cold within a minute of being on the table.  We will probably not come back.",

The restaurant is like any sports bar, but it's more roomy & the seating is comfortable. However the 'Umami Burger' is a little disappointing. First off, the burger comes without any fries or salad. Fries & salad are extra. The patty was not very tasty; NOT 'umami' at all. There is not much of anything on the patty...maybe a sundried tomato & a little bit of onions. It is just not very appetizing. I expect a yummy burger, but this burger is really bland. You pay this for $12.95, without any fries or salad. I had better burgers  somewhere else.",

We could go on Monday ( they are open FRI - MON  we are told this time,  if they told us that last time, we could come on Monday easily !! ).

I went with his cocktail recommendation, the Burning Mandarin. Citrusy with a little kick to it. The perfect Vegas drink.  My truffle burger was the bomb as usual.

The atmosphere is more of a sports bar with couches, very laid back. Perfect for MNF!  I was really shocked to see that the menu was so tiny. What threw me off guard was the fact that it's a beer garden and they had Bud Light and Stella on tap...it needs a much wider selection! We had the Pulled Pork nachos: the flavor of the meat was great, the presentation wasn't there and besides the massive layer of meat on top it was just cheese sauce and cold chips. Turkey Burger: I ate half and pushed it to the side. The green sauce they put on the burger wasn't good at all. Burger itself was flavorless and the bun was so soggy that I had to eat the bits I did have with a fork and knife. Manly Burger: this was probably the best thing at our table. Full flavor and was gone in under 5 minutes haha Truffle Fries: the cheese sauce had alittle hardening look to it. It was definitely sitting in the window waiting on the rest of the ticket. It had the consistency of almost hard wax. The sauce was only on the top part and they sprinkled some green onions on top and called it a dish. The truffle salt was good but besides that we couldn't eat them.  This place has a lot of potential but it just seems to be executed in a lazy way",

Ok, they are probably short staffed but still.  I ordered the truffle burger. Meh, I've had better. It tasted plain, not a lot of flavors going on, maybe because I like my burgers with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. The truffle burger consisted of meat, cheese, sauce, and bun. The only item that I really liked was their ketchup, that ketchup was souped up with something. All I'm saying is for the price, I could go somewhere else and have a way better experience food and service wise. (_- )",

    "text": "Concept restaurants are great and all, but you need to be able to execute without flaw to justify your ego.   FOOD: I get that at the flagship location that you don't allow any substitutions on your menu. Good for them. When i ask for something different on my burger, I don't want to argue or have to debate Stanford's Debate Team. I want a, \"Sure thing!\" and I understand I might get \"That's gonna cost you a couple bucks extra\" at which point I'd say \"I'm worth it.\" OR if you don't want people to make changes, then tell them and own it.   Avoid the nachos and the pickle plate. The nachos were put on the menu because people were asking for it and even the manager understood why we were disappointed. Question: If the manager knows its bad why are you serving it. Issues: only a tablespoon of the braised beef accompanied a slave labor camp's output of chips with \"beer cheddar\" \"fondue\" drizzled on about 7 of the chips.   The pickle plate was also a let down. They obviously use a boiling method for the pickling and they over boiled the canned veggies. Carrots, mushrooms, beet, red pepper, an actual pickle and green beans. Pickling is an easy process, it just takes time. Why not just use better ingredients and something a little more exotic for your vegetable selection. Tried everything and pushed it away. Bachi Burger has a much richer pickle plate if you ever want one in Vegas.  SERVICE: Kinda touched on this already, pushy about their concept, but this location really doesn't have one so it comes off as misguided. Our server was nice, but I was noticeably unimpressed with her attempts to stick to her script of no substitutions even though this location allows them... and I think she was just not in the mood to have to put out energy to make the experience good for us so she gave us a lot of space... for a while.   The busser cleared our plates and even asked us how things were for the first time since we got our food and we were honest about how less than spectacular we thought it was. That guy winked at both of us about 22 times in the span of 30 seconds. It was magical, but not enough for us to change our minds.  The lead/manager/assistant manager/some guy with bill control powers came up and asked how our meal was, we were honest and he agreed that the nachos and pickle plate and the wings (he mentioned them, not us) should not be eaten here. He took those items off of our bill as we barely ate any of them.  OVERALL: There's nothing here that you can't find somewhere else, better and nicer. And if a place is gonna stick to its guns about no substitutions, then it better make sure EVERYTHING on its menu rocks hard the way it is.   And one more thing: you need to be a litte more Johnny-on-the-spot with the channels on saturday afternoon during football. I don't watch football, but i sure as hell don't watch Judge Judy for 20 minutes or need it broadcast over every speaker in the joint while i'm searching for some nacho meat.",

We ask for a booth for 4 people, they seat us in a booth made for probably about 10. Huge table. Really? We asked for a smaller one but the hostess or whoever told us, \"Well they're all dirty so..\" there were at least 5 dirty empty booths at the time so I asked if they could clean one maybe? Hostess seemed irritated that I god forbid even asked of such a thing.. and told us that if we wanted to wait that we could. .. ok..   So we waited for them to clean the table. And waited. And waited. They finally do and we go to sit at the smaller booth, and one of the servers tell us \"uh, somebody is going to be sitting here...\" we replied \"yeah, us.\" Totally rude. Eh, whatever.   We get our drinks after waiting for at least 7 minutes for anybody to even realize we exist. From the busser. The server comes later to finally ask what we want. We order, and I'm watching the tables around us being sat.. at least 3 tables we all watched being ignored. Waiting at least 10 minutes to even get acknowledged. Are you kidding me?  One table ordered champagne, and the server didn't even know how to open the bottle. Had to take it into the back. The customers seemed confused. The people at those tables were still waiting to order food, looking around for anybody to help.. seriously there's so much to type but I can't even deal with writing the rest right now. Just irritating that customer service has gone down the CRAPPER.",

The first was a week night at the indoor bar where my order was taken but never came. I left hungry and chalked it up to the busy crowd.  Grounder to shortstop, out on first.  On the second time around, I witnessed a lone waiter in the main dining area performing customer service heroics by juggling a dozen tables and very nearly saving everyone's Saturday night.    Rare triple to left field, but it's caught anyway.  And this last time and surely my last trip here, my order was completely botched during an off-peak Tuesday afternoon.

After deciding that we would give them two more minutes for SOMETHING to arrive before walking out, our drinks arrived. Our server seemed frazzled but was very apologetic. The manager caught wind of our situation (or maybe he just saw the stopwatch running on my phone) because he came over to apologize as well. He offered us some \"complimentary sauces\" to go along with our fries, but, not surprisingly, those never arrived. (And I was looking forward to those \"apology sauces.\") Oh, and our check showed up before being asked if we were interested in dessert (which we were)! I guess they weren't offering any that night. Oh well.  ATMOSPHERE: It's difficult to tell where the sports book ends and the Umami Burger begins, but maybe that's the point. Either way, I can't say I enjoy eating while ESPN commentators scream in my ear about college football, but that's just me.  FOOD: Not much to say here. The fries were okay and there wasn't anything all that offensive about the burgers, but nothing stood out. So, as Las Vegas locals with lots of other restaurants to try, we won't be visiting Umami Burger again.",

I substituted a portobello mushroom for my hamburger patty and went with the Manly Burger. Wow was that good. Bacon cheese and shiitake mushrooms on a delicious bun. Fabulous!! We shared a side of sweet potato fries. They put some sort of topping on it that made it incredibly sweet and Incredibly delicious. My buddy got just a plain hamburger ( bun burger bun with nothing on it). He also said his Burger was delicious. Our wives also raved about the Umami burgerrs that they ordered. The setting is like a sports bar with the Sportsbook at the far end of the restaurant. Tons of TV so you can catch any game that you're interested in watching.

This was one place I had yet to try at the SLS so off I went to have a burger and fries before going to a play.  I had looked at the menu online and I knew what I'd order before I got there.  It sounds like I had truffle mania but actually there was little truffle taste in anything that had the name truffle attached to it.  I ordered the Sunny Side burger which is also known as the truffle especiale.  The menu describes it having parmesan frico, fried egg, truffle butter,and truffled arugula.  Along with this, I ordered the truffle fries described as thin cut fries with truffle cheese.  I ordered my burger rare and that's just the way it was served.  That was great!  The burger was large.  I didn't eat the top bun with its U brand for the company.  The burger was good.  I ate it with knife and fork rather than the pick up and slop over myself.  The fries were OK.  They were limp which I gather is the way Umami always serves them.  They were like an 80 year old who hadn't taken his Viagra.  I also had a black iced tea--known as gun powder tea--that was refilled without needing to ask.  My server was Courtney and she was TERRIFIC!  She was pleasant, knowledgable, and good at her job!  I'm glad this place was the Social Sunday place.  It was not a $25 meal but for the $12.70 price, it was OK.",

The wings were cold by the time they got to me which is lame considering I asked for them to be well done. The bar was nearly empty when I placed the order.  Burgers are small comparably here I saw. I also don't like the signs at the bar that say basically- \"don't sit here and expect to get a complementary drink unless you are entering $20 per drink into the machine & betting max bet\"  It's lame. If you sit and legit-ably gamble, your drink should be comped. Very stingey SLS.  That is the problem that I believe is that  Umami burger and SLS are separate entities and can't agree on a policy that suits guests of the hotel vs. walk ins?",

I cannot speak for the other days, but I went here with a group of 4 girls on Sunday night to take advantage of the 50% off the bill for locals. The restaurant is HUGE, and it wasn't packed. I believe they are understaffed, because the waiter took about 20 minutes to come to our table to ask for our drinks. That is by far the longest I've waited for water. AND, it was ONLY 20 minutes because I had flagged the waiter down while he was serving customers two tables away.   During those 20 minutes, my friend had even left her order with us to go use the restroom, maybe took a number 2 or the bathroom was far away, returned, and was shocked that we hadn't gotten our waters yet. Actually, we hadn't spoken to a waiter yet when she had sat back down.   Despite the slow start, the food came out within 15 minutes of ordering. I'm not sure if it had anything to do with us letting the waiter know that we were in a rush to catch a show.   I don't blame the waiter, as he was trying his best to serve the customers. Perhaps they were understaffed or didn't have the system figured out completely yet.   As for the burger--I\"ve had Umami in L.A., and this was similar. The burger was good, but not out of this world.   Truffle fries- I don't like it when my fries get soggy. I did not like the gravy looking sauce that was all over my fries, and the flavor of the sauce was meh.   Onion rings-  VERY GOOD. I'll come back on another day for that, and try out a few other items. When I'm not in a rush, and have a good 2 hours to kill.",

    "text": "It's pretty crazy how an experience can vary from one day to another.  We came in to just grab some dessert. We got a couple of ice cream cookies and shared it among friends. Amazing! The salted caramel is probably my favorite. More importantly the gentleman that served us was AWESOME. Even though we were JUST getting dessert, he treated us super nice, was super personable and even checked in on us to see how the desserts were.  So, we came back the next night. This time to eat....sure cookies were the plan, but also to grab a late meal. This time, shiz went south. Real fast.  Placed our orders...and even though it was pricey I ordered a frozen beer. I think they are only available in a few places so I said what the heck. Got SUPER excited...then....our waitress forgot my beer. Like never wrote it down, never came with it. Burgers came out. They were good....  I mentioned to the waitress my beer (after flagging her down ... since she disappeared for a while). And told her we'd like to take a look at the dessert menu.  5 minutes pass. 10 minutes pass.  She finally comes back! Alright, so do you guys want dessert? UMMMM...you forgot to bring dessert menu??? Oh, yea...here let me get you one. No, that's fine. We will skip dessert. At this point I was frustrated. She didn't bring my beer. She wasn't around the entire time. She forgot the dessert menu.   I asked for the manager and she came over. She gave me what I considered to be a pre-rehearsed speech. \"We are going to take care of your meal.\" No, thank you...I'd like to pay. I just wanted you to know that your waitress really ruined the experience...and the guy the night before is AWESOME. \"I understand sir, that you didn't ask to speak to me to get a comped meal, but we will be taking care of it since you were not 100% satisfied.\" It was robotic they way she said it. I reduced again. We went back and fourth a few times...then she finally brought my bill.  Listen, I'm sure they deal with drunk, angry customers all the time. But I was obviously sober (she forgot my beer, remember?). I genuinely wanted the manager to know, hey...this person is f'n up while also give props to the other dude. She seemed uninterested, and just offered a comp meal as a solution. I didn't want a comp meal.  So while the food is good - the service can really ruin the experience.",

The chicken nachos are just like the movie theaters, processed cheese and overpriced......and canned processed chicken. When your done eating the nachos on top the bottom of the plate is \"watery cheese\" due to the chicken juice and cheese. It was a miss and wouldn't recommend unless your here for the umami burger and the fabulous server and that's why I gave 2 stars.",

    "text": "January 30, 2015 Friday - 6:00 PM dinner 2 adults   Atmosphere - 5 stars Food - 5 stars Service - 4 stars  Background - Wanted an easy meal and in our hotel.  So I used my open table app to get a table.  After getting their clearly we did not need to.  But I got my points.  I could have made my reservation through my television in my room.  Atmosphere - Huge sports bar.  ESPN radio was taking their stuff out and CBS Sport radio was setting up.  I expected a bigger crowd for 6 PM on a Friday night.  But it made it easier for me.    Food   Drinks - Ballast Point Calico in a bottle.    My Meal     Main Course - The Hatch, a burger you would expect to have an egg with that name, but it did not.  I think it was the type of green peppers used, but the menu did not call that out.  The meat was cooked to order, and the peppers gave a nice amount of heat.  The bun was soft and held up to burger and toppings.      Side - Ordered a side of onion rings as everything is a la carte.  Our waitress told us the sides are large and one order would take care of us, and it did.  The onion rings were thick cuts and season well.  They came with three dipping sauces and all were excellent with the onions.  Sorry I do not remember their names, but the middle one had some serious heat behind it, the other was a garlic aioli.   Service - Out waitress cover a huge portion of the restaurant which made it difficult to flag her down.  But other team members were always helping out.   The only problem was when we wanted to wrap up the bill our waitress was difficult to find, and the manager actually delivered us the bill.  Future - sure.",

The menu had about 6 or seven type burgers for everyone's taste, truffle fries and a few other sides available all great choices.

Overall I thought the price for the food was a little high. Not surprised, being at a casino. For the price, fries should have been complimentary. I'll go back again for the service and atmosphere.

Nachos weren't piled w/a ton of topping but it worked! I got to taste each ingredient including the super fresh chips! Then came our burgers.. A manly and sunny side.. We couldn't decide so we split both. Sunny side was good.. Manly was AMAZING! Best burger I've ever had! Going back for lunch!  Lauren was our server.. Great service!",

We came to Umami Burger on a Monday night during Monday Night Football. The place was packed and loud, but we were seated quickly. The table was a little dirty and the sad little paper menus were stained, too.   I ordered the Jose Andres burger and a side of fries to share with my mom. The burger was a good size, but I didn't like anything about it. The meat was only good around the edges and the texture was a stringy, fatty and greasy. The flavors were just not what I was hoping for and was incredibly bland. The fries were even worse. They were dry, overcooked and flavorless.   I didn't enjoy a thing about anything I ate at Umami Burger. Even worse than the food was the service. Our waiter practically whispered every word to us and made no effort to speak up when it was clearly noisy from the football shenanigans happening around the restaurant. Refills were slow, condiments were in tiny portions and offered nothing to enhance the flavors of anything.   I don't have any interest in trying this place again.",

Because we weren't dressed to impress and I was in my race gear, the quickest place we found with no wait was Umami. Good choice since they served beer and had the college football games on. TONS of TVs! YESSSSS  We were led to a nice table in the restaurant. The tables are kinda close together and you can literally talk to your neighbors. We were serviced by a really nice lady who was friendly and accommodating to our needs.   Because of our race, we had 2 for 1 draft beers. NICE! We started off with a couple of drafts and then ordered truffle fries ($6.5) to share. I ordered the Truffle Especiale protein burger (parmesan cheese, fried egg, truffle butter and truffled arugula ($14). The fiancee order the Cali Burger (butter lettuce, roasted tomato, house spread and house American cheese ($12).  Damn these burgers were pretty expensive and lacked flavor. IMO, needed salt (which are not available on the tables). Without the buns, the portion is small. I did enjoy the fries however. Thin and crispy.  We ordered the Mintimalism Coolhaus dessert ($7). Basically it's an ice cream sandwich. It was a nice treat to have minty ice cream with chocolate chip cookies. MMM  Great place for beer and fries and to watch sporting events in a kick back atmosphere.",

We made reservations a few days before so I recommend doing that especially if there's a game. Service was also good. She was very attentive and explained to us the menu and sauces. Overall had an awesome experience and will definitely go back..maybe next week..haha!",

After we got our table,  I was relieved to find a cool atmosphere and a friendly waitress.  I ordered the Cali burger with a Portobello mushroom for the meat.  I wish they had a veggie patty - they only have a veggie sloppy joe. My burger was great despite that.  It was cheesy and the roasted tomato is awesome! They also have a house ketchup that was delicious.  My bf ordered the umami burger and said it was good.  Similar to the Cali.

At first glance, they looked small but the flavors were rich enough that it filled us up (coupled w/3) 3) SWEET POTATO FRIES. ORDER THEM.

Attentive,  never had empty drinks,  chatted with us,  and it was clear she was that way with all her tables.  David who dropped our food off was so wonderful too!

Service also delivered nicely every time, never had any issues anyone else is describing. In fact, it's probably one of quickest and most convenient \"nice\" burger spot on the strip.   But this most recent time I ordered Ahi burger. Holy cow, run and hide.   We all love ginger, I just think it should be a bit more subtle than thinly shaved strips atop your burger. And burger itself was absolutely inedible. It's as if a frozen patty was thrown on the grill in haste. Zero seasoning, zero flavor and it was still watery and cold! Come on, at least give it time to thaw out on the grill.  I'm the sort that NEVER complains. I pay, smile and don't return. Call me passive aggressive. Voila.   Why am I even rating it 3- my party's food was ok, service was quick and beer plentiful. Just wish Ahi burger wasn't such a bleh experience.",

The house salad dressing was awful... They dont describe what's in it but I dont think I want to know anymore. Their signature ketchup has also hint of spice in it, it was ok. The only thing I did enjoy was the sweet potato fries and the buns... I will not recommend this place.",

I don't feel like she deserved 20% for showing her face twice. I spent more time watching the server interact with the booth next to us than actually seeing our server.  Food was good, the only thing keeping a third star. Although 3 of us ordered the same burger but cooked differently, and when they were brought out they passed them out as if they were all the same. It was never indicated which was which. Not sure why they asked if it didn't matter? They also brought a bunch of different sauces with our onion rings but never said what was what..

    "text": "I heard such amazing things about this place and then was underwhelmed...sad face.  Maybe I put too much anticipation into the restaurant.  The menu is small, and all of the burgers sound delicious.  I got the Classic, but when it arrived, I was surprised at the size of the burger (read: small).  Having been to Bachi Burger and Burger Bar and even Yard House, for the $12 price tag of the Umami Burger, I was expecting a nice, huge, messy burger.  But it was about the size of a McDonald's double cheeseburger.  Worse, my burger was dry and flavorless.  My husband got a burger with beer cheese, bacon, and all sorts of stuff on it, and that one in contrast did have a lot of flavor.  And then came the fries.  When you order \"smothered fries\" you expect them to be SMOTHERED.  What we got was a little bit of gravy in the middle of the bowl and dry short rib on top of that.  I mean...put the gravy on top of the short rib to keep it moist.  It was hardly smothered in anything.  Things I did love: the patio has great misters and a great environment, our waitress was wonderful and perky and attentive, and the jalapeno ranch.  Oh damn that jalapeno ranch is good.  One last note.  I ended up getting a tequila based cocktail for $13 (yes, that's right, the cocktail was more expensive than the burger).  When we went next door to The Sayers Club, the EXACT SAME cocktail was $18.  As a whole, I think the SLS hotel has the most expensive drinks on The Strip, and I was shocked at the mark up from one restaurant to the lounge just next door.",

The busser came by twice looking at us each time. There were 2 waitresses who were around but never came by . We sat there for a good 7 minutes with no one even stopping by. The place overall was not even busy. As a local who has lived here for over 10 years, I was very disappointed.  On our way out, I spoke to a manager who apologized and offered to take care of us but we decided not to take him up on it. We ended up eating at another establishment at the SLS and had a wonderful experience and meal.",

    "text": "I would like to rate this place as one of the best burger joints I've dined. Gourmet burgers for reasonable prices.  UB is a hidden gem...tucked to the side within the hotel.  I felt compelled to give this place a high rating because of the menu variety and excellent customer service.  I enjoyed all the TV's in every booth and inviting fresh, fun atmosphere. UB focuses on quality and intention.  The buns are soft. The burger patty is flavorful, juicy, and the portion is generously perfect.  I was really stumped on what to eat  because I wanted all the burgers.  But, our server, Lauren (with the pretty dark hair), made it easy to choose.  She was very knowledgeable and friendly.  The Manly Burger and Truffle Fries were delish!!  I enjoyed my trip to Vegas earlier this month and next time I visit, I will be sure to return for another delicious meal at UB!!",

I got the B.U.B. this time, although it was really good, I still absolutely love the truffle burger.   Service here was fast and friendly. Our server Matthew was always there to take care of us, and our food came out fast.   As good as this place is, it's not as great as the location in The Grove. I feel like I'm at a sports bar but I guess this place is a sports bar too. In Los Angeles the Umami Burger feels more upscale.   I'm still giving this place five stars because as I've said, service is fast, friendly, and the burgers are so yummy!",

There are a lot of TV's, nice open bar area, and everything is new and clean looking.   The staff is very very pleasent.  Everyone has a smile on their face.  One thing that perplexed me was when we arrived (Like 9 at night) they told us there was a 30 Minute wait for a table... as I looked into the dining room it looked empty? I am assuming they didnt have enough servers on for the late hour? (Thus the 4 Stars)  However we were told that we could go out to the beer garden area thats open aired to the strip for immediate seating if anything was available.   The outside bar area is fantastic! Very modern looking, plenty of seating.  Very artsy with the lighting.   Shout out to Chris the bartender.  He was extremely nice, and took care of our needs.  Our drinks did not go empty.   They have this Frozen Beer there.. ask about it. It's simply genius.",

    "text": "Came to Umami Burger after a trade show at the convention center. I was staying at the W and ate at Cleo the night before, this night I was wanting more of a place to go to the bar and grab a beer, eat, watch sports, and head back. When I got here the bar was already full (good sign people were here) so I got a small table for myself. I kept catching myself looking in all directions at all the different screens there were, there is also a sports book with people betting so that was neat (if only they had a blackjack table in here).  I ordered the Umami burger because 1) the place is named after it 2) it had a crisp Parmesan cheese 3) shiitake mushrooms. The burger was great. Only disappointment was I think they shorted me on the mushrooms since I only noticed one shiitake mushroom, nonetheless it was a solid burger with soft buns and cool logo burnt on it for a nice appearance.  I also ordered the Truffle Fries. These were great as there was not an overwhelming taste of truffle and the cheese was good. What really caught my taste buds out of everything was the sauces! ASK FOR THEIR SAUCES. I believe this is one hidden gem of this place. I got their jalepeno ranch, buffalo sauce, diablo sauce, and BBQ. I'm a sauce guy so I was excited when my waitress brought all these out after only asking for ranch and buffalo. The ranch is more of a homemade ranch that they make in house, the buffalo is fantastic if you're a buffalo fan, the diablo is exactly how you imagine it tasting, and the BBQ was a smoky tang flavor. LOVE the sauces.  Lastly I had the cookie with ice cream and it's a perfect dessert in the desert...(good luck to the people who can't read the difference between those)  A warm cookie oozing the chocolate chips as you fork through it to the perfect scooped vanilla ice cream on the bottom. Not too rich!  Other than the food the service was prompt and respectful. The beer came cold, the burger came much quicker than expected, and the waitress was very nice.",

Very flavorful and the juices just oozed with every bite.  They put thick slabs of bacon chunks on top of the burger so when you bite into one, you just get a big chunk of chewy, moist bacon flavor.  Each bun was branded with the \"U\" logo which was pretty cool.  Not too pricey, but everything is Ala carte so fries are separate. :(  Looks like a great place for parties.  Very trendy, but when I was there, it was not too busy so although it was a nice atmosphere with large screens everywhere, the room lacked the buzz.  Nice drink menu.  Even offered frozen Kirin beer, which sounded yummy, but too cold for this Hawaii girl in Vegas!  Overall it was a great dining experience and would definitely go back for my manly burger....Yum!",

    "text": "My wife and I tried this brand new LV location for lunch, I ordered the manly burger, honestly I was very disappointed, it was slightly bigger than a slider, not worth $15, taste and quality average, I've had lots better that were less $. The big problem we had was with my wife's order, she got the Korean style brat, as she was digging into this brat she found the casing which was as tough as a rubber glove, couldn't even cut it with a steak knife, our very nice waiter was concerned and helpful and offered her another item, she ordered the Boring salad, not quite boring, after a few bites of this salad she noticed a few leafs and jicama had black gritty dirt on them! Our waiter felt really bad and got the manager. The manager offered to take both items off the bill but was hardly concerned about anything, she was more interested reading her texts on her phone, she didn't even ask us what was wrong and took no initiative to bring my wife's food back to the kitchen and check with their staff, absolutely no concern and no people skills. Not coming back to this place",

    "text": "When you fail the fundamental basics of customer service, you're going to get a 1 star. Looking for a bite to eat before meeting friends, I decided to try Umami Burger, as I'd heard good things about it. I waited patiently, since the place had a handful of tables busy, and the bar was half full. 10 minutes went by. Not even so much as an acknowledgement that I was there, let alone any hope of getting seated. The final straw was this guy in a Manziel jersey (all the staff except the bartender had football jerseys on, due to it being an NFL Sunday) who walked lazily past me four times, looked at me directly twice, and ignored me. At that point, I'd had enough and walked out. Rule #1 of any service industry - acknowledge that the customer is there. Needless to say, I won't ever be eating here voluntarily. If you can't even get the first, most basic rule right, that speaks poorly of the business as a whole.",

THE BUN WAS RIGHT OUT OF A BAG :(  the fries are $8.00 extra, theyre soggy, the onion rings are $10.00, the batter was thick, cold and soggy, very gross when you bite into one. one person ordered their chicken wings, very soggy with icky sauce... Why is everything so soggy ???? the patties had no flavor, the green chile buger was awful,  they also charge $3.50 per pepsi NO FREE REFILLS, ice teas? $3.50 NO FREE REFILLS.... you dont find out until you get the bill...... bad restaurant policy :(  everyone in our group said they were the worse burgers they ever had !! save your money......... yes......... we did order their apple dessert..YUCK...............right out of the micro wave.. the crust was tough and chewy... what a disappointment....weve never been to another location and sure wont...for VEgas??? terrible save your money:(  fyi: for a third of the price Smashburger has a great, tasty buger!!",

I went on line/ they didnt take reservations which was fine- there was room when our party of 4 arrived. The menu has alot for everyone but we came for a burger. Our group each picked a diff one based on our likes.  I had the Mindy Kaling burger-spicy deliciousness: my hub had the Manly with the bacon lardons. He didn't speak for 20 minutes telling me he enjoyed it. Our friends ordered the Umami burger which came with an awesome parm/cheddar crisp and home made ketchup. We all enjoyed it. Including the tempura onion rings and deep fried butter pickles. Our server was also delightful. Very helpful and fun as well. Great spot.",

I've never had truffle anything before, so I figured I would give it a go. The fries left an extremely odd taste in my mouth, which i didnt really care for. I'm not sure if this is because its an acquired taste or if it was just no good, but I'm leaving this at three stars just in case. I ordered the Manly Burger and it was absolutely fantastic. I would come back here again, i would just be wary of the truffle fries.",

    "text": "I was excited when I heard Umami was finally coming to Vegas but my excitement quickly turned to disappointment when I actually tried this spot out.  A lot my review is based off a comparison of this location to the ones in Laguna Beach and The Grove in Southern California. If you've never been to a Umami before, its definitely worth checking out even here at the SLS.   Umami serves up some pretty good gourmet burgers and fries. The burgers are juicy and flavorful, and you can taste the quality in the toppings. The stamped buns are almost begging you take a picture and Instagram it. Plenty of sides and entree options means there is something for everyone. While the food is fine I take issue with the dining experience itself.   Each time I have dined here the restaurant has been virtually empty, but somehow there is always a 10-15 minute wait to be seated in a barren dinning room. The outdoor patio huge and overlooks the north end of the strip. The free ping-pong, air hockey and foosball tables are a nice touch and a good distraction while waiting on your food. Unfortunately, the massive size of the patio makes for just an awkward dining space. Rarely is anyone at the bar or eating out there and the backless wooden benches make for an uncomfortable dining tables.They merged the main dining room with the \"sports book\" and its a mess. Random people walking in and out making bets and standing around creates a weird dining atmosphere. Service has always been slow and disappointing. Its sad that this locations gives so many first timer Unami eaters a bad first impression of the franchise.",

We were promptly seated with our party of 6. Carlos was our server and gave great explanations and recommendations. We started with the truffle fries and the buffalo wings. The wings were crunchy and not soggy or dropping in sauces, the truffle fries were amazing with the truffle cheese. For lunch I got the Truffle burger medium and my partner got the green bird with a beef patty. Both burgers exceeded expectations. My picky teenager got the manly and devoured it. We also had the sweet potato fries from checking in here and those were also simple and amazing. I love the food and the atmosphere (think sports bar) and definitely recommend it for anyone wanting to catch the game, get a good drink, and really good food.",

Finally visited and it's an odd experience for an upscale burger place. Maybe because it was around 6? Seat yourself - which equates to a 10-15 minute wait for service. Ordered everything once the server arrived to avoid future wait times - Hatch burger and Manly burger with sweet potato fries. Both burgers dlish and portion of fries enough for 2 to share, but no special sauce, just Heinz. The vibe was so off from the locations in LA and for the prices, I'd expect a little more service. Maybe the focus is different since the SLS was sold?",

    "text": "I came here with a few of my girls before hitting the Foxtail Dayclub. There was no wait and we were seated promptly at a booth table. Walking in, I instantly noticed how different the decor was from the location in Palo Alto. While the one in PA had a much more college library type of feel, this location has more of a sports bar type of feel.   Our server was Tashja. She was super sweet and attentive to our needs. I ordered the throwback burger which had two beef patties, ketchup, pickles, mustard, cheddar cheese, and minced onions along with the FREE truffle fries (make sure you check in on Yelp for this!). To be completely honest, I think the burger I ordered had too much meat portion. But that shouldn't be anything to complain about lol so to make it better maybe some produce like lettuce or tomatoes would make the burger taste even better. Also the burger seemed to have too much bread as  well, so it did seem like a heavy burger. You would think that since the order of truffle fries is free that they would be smaller in portion. But no, my order was heaping with fries!   I don't think I would go out of my way from the strip to SLS to come here, but if I am in the area; I would come back!",

    "text": "Came here because groupon was having a really good deal, $25 for 2 burgers & 2 sides.   You have to park in the SLS parking structure and then walk into the casino. Umami Burger is on the opposite side of the casino floor. No worries though, because SLS is very small so its not a long walk at all.   When my friend and I first arrived, we were really confused. There were two lines, roped off but no host. So we went inside a bit, no one said anything to us, and walked back out to the host stand and was about to walk to the other entrance when the host finally came. I wouldn't have known she was the host because she didn't have a uniform, I just saw her ear piece and was like... maybe she'll help us. She didn't say anything to us, and I had to tell her seating for two people. Even when she led us to a booth, and set down our menus, she still didn't say anything.   Our server wasn't too friendly, but he was attentive. I added lettuce, tomatoes (which he told me were grilled), and onions to my truffle burger. I wanted to order the truffle fries but was afraid it would be too much truffle so settled on the garlic parmesan fries. My fried ordered the ahi burger and sweet potato fries.   Our food came out in a good amount of time. My friend said she could SMELL the truffle when it was brought out. Maybe my taste buds suck or something, the truffle burger had truffle cheese and a truffle aioli but i didn't really get that much of a truffle taste. The burger patty itself was very juicy, and cooked medium, just the way I like it! One of the RARE occasions where I actually get my meat cooked how I want it! I like my fries to be... not so skinny. So I didn't enjoy the fries very much, but they were crispy. The pieces of shredded parmesan was just sad. At least melt the cheese or use a different type of parmesan. A lot of the parmesan fell off as I was trying to grab the fries.   Overall, my friend and I enjoyed our meal. It was interesting to watch all the different sports on the many many TV screens that they had. Apparently, you can bet at the bar and watch whatever sport they have on the big screen. Trust me, the screen spans the entire wall. They had baseball on as well as football and boxing.   Don't expect to come here for a nice date night. Because of all the sports, it can and WILL get very loud! On the way out, we walked right past the host who just stared at us. I was watching the way that she seated other parties (without a smile), and wanted to see if she would thank us for coming in or at least say goodbye. Nope.   SLS is a pretty confusing drive from Henderson, our GPS took us in a weird route. I may be back but not anytime soon.",

We waited in line forever at 800 Pizza for them to tell us when we finally got to the counter that they were out of gluten-free crust, so this is where we ended up. (As SLS has a pretty shitty selection of restaurants and by then we barely had time to eat) Anyway, enough about us..  This place is a small burger joint that is directly in the tiny sportsbook, so you get to listen to the blaring sports games over the loudsystem while you to try and converse. The menu sucks. Maybe 10 items on the menu, and very limited toppings for burgers. Also, the burgers don't come with fries, everything is a la carte. I ordered a \"burger\" with truffle cheese, truffle oil, and substituted the patty for a Portobello, as I don't eat meat and had it wrapped in lettuce since I don't eat bread.  They don't offer a small salad or anything for those of us that don't want fries. No other sides, whatsoever.  He ordered a turkey burger, and one side of truffle fries. Soda water and iced tea for our drinks.  Server wasn't rude, but certainly not friendly. Acted like we were a burden. Food runner dropped the food and ran. Had to keep asking for ketchup, mustard, and extra napkins, as nothing is kept on the table. For one \"veggie\" burger, one turkey burger, one side of fries, a tea and soda water.. $43.00. He said his was just ok, however mine was delicious. The final straw, though, was that we were charged $3.15 for soda water!! I've never seen a place (yes, even on the strip) that charges for soda water. Won't be back.",

I had half of the tuna burger and half of the umami burger, both were great, but the tuna was my favourite!  If you like onion rings, theirs is A MUST! Perfectly battered and crunchy, I fell in love. We ordered the buffalo wings as a starter, they were nothing to write home about. Just your generic wings, really, which was a bit disappointing.  I also loved that they have a \"taster\" option for their draught beers. Great for if you're not sure what beer you want, or if you just like a bit of variety!",

My burger has amazing taste and the onion  rings (which I highly recommend) are mind blowing.

    "text": "I've been to the bar twice, I was met with high beer prices and unfavorable service. I'll never understand why a beer garden has a wall of vodka, but anyhow... We finally gave Umami Burger a try. The Code sent my husband 50% off for his birthday. It seemed like a good excuse to give it a whirl.  Service was attentive. Our waitress got started on our Union Jack ($9) and Mama's Little Yella Pils ($8) while we looked over the menu. We settled on the Manly burger ($12) for him and the Umami aka Original burger ($12) for me. Both prepared medium rare. We ordered two secret menu items: Cheesy Tots ($5) and Manly Fries ($6.50).  Prior to our food coming out, we were given house condiments: jalapeno ranch, mega spicy and garlic aioli. We were warned of the spiciness but didn't believe it would be as hot as it was. We enjoy spicy too. We didn't like the aioli at all, but the jalapeno ranch was the standout. It livened up the original burger and it was good on the tots and fries. Also, better than the housemade ketchup.  The Umami burger is topped with caramelized onions, roasted tomato and one shiitake mushroom, and parmesan frico. The burger to bun ratio is good, the bun was decent. I like the branding of buns - it's a good emphasis of their brand. The patty was of good size. All of which are good things, but why was it so bad? I wondered. It came down to the meat being overdone. It was dry and bland. There was no juiciness at all. The caramelized onions and parmesan frico were the only redeeming qualities. What's with one shiitake mushroom? You better enjoy that single bite.  The Manly burger is topped with beer cheddar, bacon lardons, onion strings and slathered with ketchup and mustard. It was not cooked medium rare, it bordered on medium to medium well. This was, however, the better burger of the two. Still, both were pretty disappointing.  The sides, though, were quite good. The tater tots were salty, potatoey, crisp on the outside and gooey in the center. I really enjoyed them. The manly fries were quickly consumed. Crisp shoestring fried topped with beer cheese, bacon and onion strings, kinda hard to go wrong there. I guess the secret menu is where it's at!?!   In the future, I'd order a beer and tots for snack, but I'd definitely skip the burgers.",

I liked how each booth had a flat screen but there were flat screens and sofas if you just wanted to relax as if you're at home!  I opted for a booth but had great views of the entire place for decent people watching. I started off with a cold green tea which was flavorless. My waitress who was there physically but mentally absent took my order for BBQ wings , onion rings and the  B.U.B burger. I specifically requested the wings first and others to follow later but within minutes after the wings arrived the other two items appeared. When the waitress returned and I advised her what happened and her reply was the kitchen was caught up!  The food was decent but I was pleased mostly with the wings. The onion rings were too large, under cooked and a few had too much batter. The burger which contained two large slices of beef, bacon bits and contained another slice of bread which I removed. The burger was overcooked and on the dry side. I was ready to order peanut butter ice cream but the absent minded waitress didn't even bother asking if I wanted dessert and just left me my tab. It's ashame an establishment put this much time and money into this business and yet they have such a sad and unmotivated employee interacting directly with clients. I made sure I tipped accordingly which I thought was still generous.  Compared to my first experience outside at the Umami Beer Garden, this was a horrible experience. Such a disappointing dining experience. If I ever returned here, I will make sure and request not to be seated in the area of this waitress!",

    "text": "Well talk about shocked only gets three stars...Or should say not sure why Umami not getting much yelp love except everyone has right too ones opinion. I feel that Umami Burger offer unique experience comes to watching games at a sports book. Trust me use to be one of those sports parley betting addict every weekend. Before realize the house always win. Lol. I can only think of handful of sports book that first off offers food more less quality food not just your normal fried everything bar food. Plus the ones that do offer food usually adjacent or may need to walk some ways get food then bring it back. Not like the sports books are made for food. The chairs made for parley sheet, drink, and sheet write down bets. If in front of small television booth in reality same thing. The thing about Umami literally you just walk up place bet (live betting; that new one for me) and go back too eat, drinking, or talking stories with friends. I came here watch MNF with friends visiting from the 808. I read reviews that need order certain amount on Sunday or on football days in general. Between the three of us ordered everything and the kitchen sink so we were good. We started with truffle fries, nachos, wings, and I had \"The Royale Burger\".  The truffle fries was Amazing! By far the best truffle fries had in long time. I had the ones at more fancy place like Olives that totally suck compare too Umami. The thing that makes them shine above the rest. The homemade truffle cheese that put over the fries, then add truffle oil on top, and nice hot right out of the fryer. Just the smell is divine. If not fungus person this not the dish for you. But if love cheese fries in general these truffle fries take tradition fries too another level. Rich. The Nachos with the short rib meat on top, fresh guacamole (one of the better ones had in town), jalapeno, fresh cilantro sprigs, and the chips. The CHIPS tell fresh chips nice thick corn ones. I could have just eaten chips and salsa whole game be content in life. Me my pet peeves with Nachos like mound of stuff on top but think excess not always better. I love the fact that really had the right amount that none of the chips got completely drowned by the topping that the chips on the bottom bottom still has the crispy crunch. The chicken wings we had six an six. Those were ok nothing really memorable about them.   The \"Royale\" Burger talk about gourmet burger! This one rivals any of the top gourmet burger joints in Vegas. I can honestly say hit the full list from Gordan, Bobby, Burger Bar, Holstein, Fuku, Bachi, and the only one missing is Guy. The thing I love is the combination of all the flavors. It heavy burger with lots of meat! The burger, short ribs on top, then got truffle cheese, and believe might put hint of truffle oil top it off. Messy burger. Those are the best one that all the good stuff comes out with every bite and gets all over your hands. The \"U\" on top of all the burger that nice touch that definitely  Umami style. The burger buns are on point. Few more reading description that need get me some next visit.   The service was five star for me!!!! Our server was on it. This was on FOOTBALL day or say MNF. Our server was friendly and during the game on it making sure never empty on our beers. Since first timers all around answered all our questions.   If one thing that had issue. Maybe only had one hostess working that night. Not sure if we sit ourselves down or go hostess stand get seated no sign. From the outside looks more like lounge then restaurant restaurant. I never checked out the Beer Garden.   Umami Burger is awesome. I look forward too trying more of the burgers next time.",

    "text": "This is not my first time at Umami, but this was my first time at this location. My first Umami experience was at The Camp in the OC.  I wasn't impressed with the service, the wait, and my burger at the OC location. At the time, I thought Umami was just over-hyped.  After my experience at this location, I'm convinced...I know Umami is over-hyped.    Let's start with service. We arrived around 1:40 PM on a busy football Sunday.  We were fortunate to get seated right away.  Our orders were taken fairly quick and our waitress was attentive. The service and the wait at this location is 10 times better than the location in Orange County.  I just think we got lucky and had a good waitress.  The guests seating directly behind us weren't so fortunate. I noticed that no one was attending to them. After about 10 minutes, they left.    This Umami was packed with enough TV screens that there's no chance of missing any football action.  There's even a sports book right inside Umami.  If you're a fan of William Hill's Sports Betting, then you'll love the ambiance here.  I didn't place any bets because most of the afternoon football action was already closed.  Good for me. That also means I didn't lose a cent.    I thought that the food was less than average. We started out with their Smothered Fries, which is their thin fries covered with braised short ribs.  This wasn't bad, the burger on the other hand, was. If you've been to Umami, then you know that their burgers look better than they taste.  First of all, Umami uses a thick or high bun.  The bun alone is about 4 inches high. I think this is done intentionally to compensate for a weak burger patty.  I got the B.U.B, which is supposed to be 12 oz.  For a 12 oz burger, it was small, exceedingly greasy, and lacked taste.  The burger is so greasy and the bun so soggy from the grease that you're almost forced to eat your burger quick.  Otherwise, your burger will turn into an open face burger.  Yes, it gets all over the place. I wasn't impressed with Umami. I wasn't impressed at all.  Overall, I was disappointed with the food at Umami's.  The only reason this Umami gets 3 stars from me is because of their sports book and game day TV screens.",

    "text": "I wanted to know what the addition of Unami  ingredients would enhance or compete with the beef.  After a couple of minutes the wet ingredients overcame the dry bun so I ended up eating it with a fork and knife.  Each ingredient was highly tasteful; portobello mushroom tomatoes carbonized onions and the parmesan\"Frico\" were knockouts.   What I missed was my idea of a burger:. Something I can hold in my hands and get a great burger taste, maybe with cheese.  What I got at Unami was almost a burger and a bunch of ingredients that didn't help the meat even t though they were good.  The burger itself was not hand made and I think that it did not have enough air in the ground meat which led to a tougher bite.   Overall it's good if you want to go for an alternative to the traditional burger.  At $14 I don't think I'd come back",

    "text": "We stayed at the SLS and decided to try Umami after arriving from the airport and checking in. We were extremely tired from a day of traveling (I was practically closing my eyes at the table), and we were super hungry...so a burger sounded great. The restaurant was pretty much quiet and dead, but it was a Sunday night. I think we were one of five tables there.   We had a coupon from the hotel desk for a free appetizer, and I asked if there were any exclusions, and the waitress was a little snippy. My boyfriend ordered the Truffle Burger (she asked how he wanted it cooked, and he said medium) and I ordered the Greenbird, which is a turkey burger instead of beef.   My boyfriend took a couple bites into his burger and I could see on his face that something was wrong. This thing was super rare...way more undercooked than he anticipated. We're never ones to really complain about things, but he pointed it out when the waitress came back to check on us. She was kind of rude and seemed oddly confused about it. She just stared at him and said \"well OUR medium HERE is red like that.\" He always orders medium, so clearly this place must do things differently, or the burger wasn't cooked long enough in the kitchen. He asked for a replacement burger cooked medium-well so that he'd at least be able to enjoy his $14 burger. When she brought it out, her attitude was a little better and she apologized a few times. Her words were \"sorry guys, that was my fault\" which caught our attention, because we didn't exactly get what THAT meant after all that trouble...  She also noticed my boyfriend's empty water and said \"oh...I'll get you more water\" but never came back for the duration of our meal, except for dropping off the check. (Like I said, it was not busy at all in there).   My turkey burger was also a little pink, which I didn't expect for poultry...but I honestly scarfed it down in like 2 seconds and was too tired to care. It probably shouldn't have been that pink. The greenbird is definitely a tasty burger though.",

Something about the tomato just threw me \"off\".  The sauce that they put on it was very tasty.  Not entirely certain what it was, but it was yummy.  We also ordered the Umami burger, which was very good (so I hear, as I don't do mushrooms).  To top it off we ordered the sweet potato fries to share.  They were good but the brown sugar threw me off again.  All in all, we would visit again if ever at the SLS, however I wouldn't make a special trip for it.   Service was good, not horrible but not great either.  The place was not super busy and they were still just opening, so I understand some confusion.  All we ordered was water due to it being 116 outside and having a plane to catch.",

The burger itself was a little dry and the flavor wasn't as rich and indulgent, especially for the price we were paying.   On a brighter note, the drink list is pretty extensive and there is a sports book with a bunch of tv's.   Umami is tucked in a corner on the casino floor of the SLS Resort on the very north end of the Las Vegas Strip   We came here on a Friday and there was absolutely no line and very few guests dining. (Should have been an indicator)   All in all the burger experience was mediocre and would have gladly gone to in and out instead.",

My last visit on Thursday.. how can you get rid of the special sauces for the burgers???? Isn't that part of the Umami burger experience? Jalapeno ranch.. gone! Aioli.. gone!!! Urggg.. I ordered fries just to dip in the Jalapeno ranch and what I got was' bottled' ranch... yuck! Please bring these back... I hate to know you corrected the service and now have missing special sauces.

The restaurant was not busy, maybe six tables all together. 10 minutes passed and two tables were sat after us and acknowledged by a server. So, we waited another 5 minutes and still no acknowledgement. I advised the bartender and hostess, they said they would send someone over and apologized. So, now it's 8:35 and it has been 15 minutes... not even a glass of water or a hello.   Finally, we waited and we saw a waitress come out, she walked right passed us, and went to another table that just sat down. At that point I was done... we sat there in an empty restaurant for over 30 minutes and we were not acknowledged once by any server.   We got up and walked out, and we will never be back.

    "text": "I was pretty satisfied with my experience at umami. The atmosphere of this bar was awesome. I was there during the NCAA tournament which made it even more fun. The crowd was really into the games, they were very upbeat and excited to be able to watch the games on multiple tvs while placing bets without having to be at the sports book.  Also the food was pretty good. I ordered the green bird which was a turkey patty with avocado and it was great! Very tasty, perfectly cooked. I added some truffle fries to my meal and I was pretty happy with them.  They offer several options for their skinny fries: the garlic fries, the truffle fries (probably the better option) and the sweet potatoes fries. They also carry a good selection of bar food in case you do not feel like eating a burger. Overall, a good place to watch sports, place some bets and enjoy good food!",

I love the brussel sprouts, once they were a bit soggy and undercooked, regardless the flavor is amazing, definitely on the sweet side.

The worst aspect was the lack of professional service. I ate at the bar since I was alone....and waited for 15 minutes for one of the two bartenders to acknowledge me. After ordering it took 20 minutes for the food to arrive. Part of the problem was the two bartenders having to make drinks for the full bar and for the table waitstaff. The place was jammed and management should have provided more staff. Prices were excessive but then it's Vegas, where everything is overvalued.",

Back to my favorite part, Liz put in the order for the impossible burgers and added truffle style. Again, I was incredibly surprised that it wasn't beef! Literally, the best burger on the planet.

It had onion straws, bacon and cheddar. I asked for it medium. It came out very well done and had American cheese on it. I realllly don't like American cheese but I couldn't tell it wasn't cheddar till about two or three bites in I was wondering why it tasted like plastic. So I didn't send it back. Also, make no mistake, this is a sports bar. It is not quiet. It is not pub-like. It's loud and there's tv's and sports fans everywhere. Also totally fine if you know what you're getting. But I thought it was a gourmet burger place. My mistake.",

Umami itself has a really open feeling and lots of TVs. You'll get lost in many sporting events here. The patio is calling my name and I can't wait until the fall to enjoy some cold ones.   The food menu is somewhat small, with a few salads and burgers but their beer list is ginormous. Seriously though. It's 3/4 of their entire menu. Awesome. Pour me a cold one!   Our server was awesome. There were 6 of us and he rattled our orders back to us without writing a thing down. I ordered the Truffle Burger, lettuce wrapped and the plain fries. He asked me what temperature I wanted the burger cooked and I requested medium. The fries are shoestring and I'm a steak fries kind of girl, but they were fries and they tend to be good no matter how large or small. This batch was a bit saltier than I prefer, but I still managed to finish the whole batch. The burger was cooked on the med-rare side, so although it wasn't hitting the spot, I was starving and finished it without complaint.",

The Truffle burger was tender,savory and juicy as well all the ingredients seem to compliment each other. The Truffle fries were great too food came out after about 15 minutes and was hot.  Only deducting one star because the portion sizes are kinda small and I thought it would've been similar to say like slaters where you could create your own burger but it wasn't really like that. nonetheless was good and would definitely recommend !",

Thank you KC for a great experience.",

We chose Umami Burger, I had high expectations because of the reviews but really this place is not worth it. My husband ordered a Sunny and I ordered an Umami, meat was dry and overcooked ( in both burgers). We liked the fries and my daughter chicken tenders were ok. I'm sorry but this place is too expensive for a dry and overcooked burger.",

    "text": "More of a review of the Beer Garden located within Umami Burger.  Good spot to watch a game, place some bets at the attached sports book, and enjoy a cold beer.  For a beer garden the tap selection is underwhelming though but an overall decent selection of brews.  They have some outdoor seating if you feel like melting to death in the 100 degree temps. I preferred sitting inside with the cold air conditioning and multiple screens to view all the sports. Plus, the booths have their own tv's too. Video poker at the bar area.  Just had a beer here so I can't comment on the food, but my brew was chill, the service was good, and the Stanley Cup playoff game was on. Life is good.",

    "text": "When I was walking around the SLS Las Vegas Hotel while waiting for my hotel room, I was ecstatic to try out the Umami Burger restaurant. I sat inside near the bar on my first visit. Their alcoholic beverage menu had more items than the food menu. The first burger I tried during my first visit was the Throwback burger with two beef patties, white cheddar cheese, miso mustard, Umami house ketchup, soy pickles, and minced onions. I also had sweet potato fries on the side. Let me tell you, I was amazed with the Throwback burger that I literally wanted to order another one, but I was too full. It was juicy, not too salty, and a tad bit tangy. The sweet potato fries tasted more like cinnamon, which I did not mind.  My second visit to Umami was on the second day of my stay at the SLS. This time around, I asked for outdoor seating since I was in a group with five other people. I ordered the Truffle burger with truffled aioli, house truffle cheese and truffle glaze and a side of truffle fries. Out. Of. This. World.  My last visit was on the fourth day, in which I ordered the Sunny Side with parmesan frico, fried egg, some butter, a hefty amount of arugula, and truffled aioli as well as a side of sweet potato fries. The Sunny Side burger wasn't the greatest for me. It tasted more like an arugula salad than a burger. The sweet potato fries were great anyway.  The service at Umami in the SLS Las Vegas was outstanding. I even used the complimentary ice cream sandwich coupon from the coupon book that held my room key and tried the Peanut Butter Double Chocolate ice cream sandwich. Sweet and salty amazingness.  I'm just so glad that there are two Umami Burger restaurants in San Francisco. I just checked their menu and there is a wider variety than the menu at the SLS. Score!",

    "text": "Umami fans in SoCal should know the drill here for the most part - for everyone else, Umami is a decent burger place that has some unique little spins although the menu doesn't seem to have really innovated all that much from many years past with a taste that is just okay.     The restaurant is primarily a beer/burger place with some side options like salads and such.  If you're staying at the SLS, make sure to bring down the coupon book in case they do have some interesting options for food (like free ice cream sandwiches).    Burger-wise, I tried the Ahi Tuna burger.  Presentation was fine.  The taste was simply okay.  The burger oddly didn't have much flavor although it had a ton of ingredients on it.  My friend said he enjoyed his onion rings and truffle fries along with their unique slightly spiced ketchup.  The ice cream sandwiches weren't bad but nothing too special.  Also had the beet salad side which was surprisingly big.  Didn't like the flavor very much this go-around for some reason though.  Prices will vary about $8-$15 per item.    They have a regular beer/bar menu with a sorta-extensive beer list.  Surprised that the beer flight was limited to just a few of the core beers that included such not-so-great examples like Coor's and Bud.  They do have specialty beers at the very least which is worth checking out if you like it.  They also have a bar area with video poker.    Decor-wise, you're looking at a very sports/bar setting.  They seem to have a beer garden in the back although when I was there, no one was around that outer area so we stayed indoors which had plenty of seating and tons of TV's.    I'm personally surprised it closes at 11PM - being a beer garden/sports bar in a Vegas location.  Perhaps it's with the lack of a crowd at night but feel that it's a restaurant/bar that should be open much later - especially for the late munchies crowd.    In the end, I'd give the restaurant about a 3 1/2 stars.  It's not bad by any means and hasn't lost much in the transition to the Las Vegas.  It just doesn't seem to have evolved much in its taste and even lacks a little bit in the wow/taste factor.",

    "text": "One of my fav burger places in LA finally made it to Vegas! Unlike many of the LA restaurants, this Umami burger is also a sports bar and beer garden.  There is usually plenty of seating unless there is a big game on. We've been here twice already and the burgers/fries are so consistently well executed. I'm not a huge fan of truffle fries, so I usually get the regular thin fries and Umami burger. The size of the burger is on the smaller side, but it is very filling especially with fries and a beer on the side.  This Umami burger is located in the SLS hotel, and they offer both valet and self parking. I would definitely recommend the burgers here for anyone looking for a casual dining restaurant!",

There were 12 TV's outside that I saw, a lengthy bar area, and some table games as well. I would definitely recommend eating outside; however, they raised the window shades halfway through our meal which in turn raised the temperature about 10 degrees. Keep the shades down guys! The view isn't worth it unless you like looking at trashy souvenir shops.   I only tried the sliders and sweet potato fries (because they were free for the party!) but both were delicious. However, the Pepsi I ordered was very watered down and the menu was very basic with little variety at all.   I was impressed with the good service! Our waitress Rachel was juggling several rowdy tables but made sure to bring over drink refills and ask if we needed anything else. She had a huge smile as well. Take note, management! She deserves her tips tonight.   Overall, I enjoyed the kickoff party, food specials, and the football atmosphere but wouldn't return on a regular night.",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of getting an invite to a private party here at Umami Burger, SLS where I was treated to comp burgers, fries, drinks, and dessert and it was OUTSTANDING.  Thanks so much to TouchTunes for throwing an awesome party and inviting me to come!  I have eaten at an Umami burger before and liked it and this time, I happened to get a truffle burger as the tray was passing by and it was so delicious.  Sometimes things covered in truffle oil can just be overwhelming and more hype than yum, but this burger was mouth-wateringly fantastic.  I paired it with some of their sweet potato fries which are sweet AND salty and thus, deliciously flavorful - hm.  Umami?  Luckily for us, they also brought out some of their signature ice cream sandwiches and we got to try each.  I liked them, but my first one was the best, chocolate cookie with peanut butter ice cream.  By the end, the cookie parts were getting a little soggy for my taste.  Overall an AMAZING experience and the people working the party and wandering around with trays of tasty treats were so polite and friendly, we really felt like we were at a friend's party.  A few days later, we found ourselves BACK at Umami Burger.  We were looking for somewhere to watch the Nascar race and I remembered that Umami Burger is also connected to the sports book at SLS and is filled with televisions everywhere.  Because it was the March Madness semi finals, I was worried about where to go, but no worries, we were able to get into a booth at Umami and have our private television in the booth tuned to the Nascar race.  Of course, no sound, but at least we were right up close and personal and could see all of the racing action.  Since we'd done burgers and fries, we decided to try some of the other fair offered and the husband ordered buffalo wings and I had the nachos (sans beans).  The nachos come with braised pot roast on them and it's really good.  I enjoyed the nachos very much... only thing that would have made them better would be MORE CHEESE.  Why are people always stingy with the cheese anyway?  We also ordered the pickle plate which is not pickles at all... well, there are a couple of bites of pickles, but it is a plate of a bunch of different pickled veggies, more of a giardiniera with beets, spicy carrots, peppers, etc.  It was tasty! I also actually ordered one of the ice cream sandwiches (the same one I'd like before), but it was surprisingly soggy like the ones I'd had late in the evening at the party, so I thought that was weird, and disappointing.  I wouldn't recommend the ice cream sandwiches due to that.  We milked a good 3 hours at that table and our server was very gracious, but we kept ordering and I dropped a 25% tip to make up for hogging the table.    Between these two experiences, I definitely recommend Umami burger.  The food is quite tasty and my service experiences were very good.  I'll be back.",

We should have just left at this point.   We started off with the truffle fries (which are free if you check in on Yelp). These were very tasty! And the three sauces they were served with were amazing as well. My favorite was the spicy orange one. These fries were the only reason I gave a 2 star rating as opposed to a 1.   Our waitress explained that since their meats are very fresh that the color of the meat may be more red than we are used to. Okay, no problem. I asked that my burger to be cooked medium and there wasn't any redness in the meat at all! It looked more like it was well done....Why give us that warning if all of our burgers came out dry and overcooked?",

I came here last week with my family while we were on vacation and staying at the SLS; we wanted a quick bite to eat and decided to stop in here since we'd heard good things.  BIG MISTAKE!  My father, husband and I all got food poisoning despite ordering different things.  My husband ordered the original burger, which he received completely charred despite ordering it medium well.  My father ordered the hot dog, and I had the tuna burger; other members of our party ordered other burgers, and we all shared a bunch of the fries.  To be fair, the friend food tasted mostly okay. My tuna burger was inedible; I expected it to be raw in the middle, but it was inexplicably rubbery and tasteless, too.    Needless to say, any positive experiences we had (the service was fine, and the prices weren't horrible for what's around, I guess) were completely negated by the fact that half of our party spent the rest of our vacation throwing up and unable to get out of bed.  We all got sick within hours of eating at Umami burger, and none of us had eaten anything else questionable that day, so we are pretty sure of the culprit.  Totally ruined our stay in Vegas!",

Inches away from the next diner and to get up, you basically had to walk a block.  So I saw an empty booth and asked to be moved and they did relocate us.  Ordered the Manly's and garlic fries.  My first comment was that the food was not hot.  Burgers seemed that they were probably par cooked and then finished to medium, but it was truly just luke warm.  The fries were not hot at all.  For half price it was just OK.  If I paid full price I would be unhappy.  On the plus side, being that it was super crowded, the service was very good.  Our food order taken quickly, drinks came right out, and food came out very quickly.  But, I don't think I will return.  Fat Choy, just 3 blocks away is leaps and bounds better.",

My medium hamburger was served raw in the centre and had to be sent back. After waiting an extremely long time to be served they obviously rushed the order and undercooked it. But that makes it all the more disappointing, because then I had to wait around again to get a properly cooked burger. (And let's be realistic, unless the meat is cut on the property, hamburger meat needs to be carefully cooked.) The fried pickles were excellent. The onion rings were obviously dropped into a fryer that was too cold since the batter was exceedingly oily and had little flavour and we only ordered them because so many people rave about them, only to find them almost a total disappointment that we didn't even want to eat.  So basically, good server, bad (slow) service caused by the kitchen. Disappointing onion rings and undercooked burger. What a disappointment... recommended by Thrillist, but maybe they haven't been here lately?",

They had a hard time getting their logistics together but tried really hard.  Really great service here, especially by their manager Rachel, who went over the top for us here.    Get the regular burger, which is what they are known for.  Do medium rare.  It's juicy, slightly salty and tart, with plenty of beefiness.    Good service, good food - place some sports bets.    And thanks Rachel.",

As a local, and a foodie in Las Vegas I don't usually subscribe to reviews that I read about restaurants until I experienced it myself. Well, apparently the reviews on this place are spot on. All I have to say is save your time and money and go to Bachi burger for a Wagyu burger for the same price as the smaller truffle burger you get here. Minimal flavor, and the portion sizes are very small. Much better quality at Bachi and the truffle fries are much to be desired. Also I could use a little less of the football Mongoloids at the sports bar. If we don't keep them honest they're are just going to keep churning out mediocre burger joints.  I posted the burgers from this restaurant as well as Bachi burger, and you tell me which one looks better.",

    "text": "I love Umami burgers, I love sports betting, and I love beer gardens. This place does a bad job with all three. I don't know if it's a lack of process controls from corporate, but the burgers just don't compare with the LA locations. They're either overly greasy and raw..or burnt to a crisp. The sports book is small, the odds board is just a couple of flat screens, and as far as I know they don't give out drink tickets for placed bets. The beer menu is pretty limited for being a \"beer garden.\" The LA locations usually only have 5 draft beers, but at least they are interesting craft selections. And don't get me started on the required minimums to sit down at a table. My group was told that we would have to commit to spending $100 a person in order to be seated. That's a lot of burgers and booze! We refused and they seated us anyway...go figure!  On a separate note, review your bill and credit card bill carefully if you choose to eat here. I don't know if its willful fraud or just lots of billing mistakes in their favor, but I have had overbilling problems at multiple Umami burgers. In previous experience, the Hermosa Beach location billed my card twice on two separate days for the same meal. It took multiple calls and a Visa chargeback to fix the situation. During my visit to Umami Las Vegas, we tried to split a $170 bill (tip included) on 3 credit cards. Each card was charged $90. When we complained to the manager, he claimed that it was a typo and that the waitress had meant to type $60 per person. We signed and left....but just to be clear $60 x 3 does not equal $170.  I like the concept of a restaurant branded sportsbook. I just don't like this one. I'm gonna spend my time at traditional sportsbooks, where I get to watch games with free drinks rather than get overcharged for already overpriced ones.",

She was very friendly, knowledgeable and was very eager to answer any questions we had about the menu.  Decor: Restaurant was very open, with tons of TVs to watch any channel we wanted. We even had our own TV for our booth, which is really nice. The place was also very clean.",

    "text": "There a quite a few interesting items on the menu, from truffle burgers and fries, to gourmet sausages.  I went for the Manly Burger and Smothered Fries (short rib and gravy on top of them).  The burger arrived looking anything but Manly.  However, there were large pieces of bacon as advertised.  The fries had a large pile of short rib and a thin coat of gravy.  The burger was cooked perfectly and had a good flavor to it.  The bun was sturdy and overall, except for the size was a very good burger.  The fries were ok but by themselves were nothing to write home about.",

In addition we waited 25 minutes to be seated in an empty restaurant and couldn't get a booth even though they were all empty and everyone that got seated after us got a booth. Weird level of service. They better get their act together because we have many options for burgers that are actually good.",

The bar is not quite as well stocked as I would hope and the service was nice enough if a bit slow at times. If you find yourself at or near the SLS, it's definitely worth trying.",

If you haven't tried any variation of umami's truffle burgers you are seriously missing out.   I gave this umami 5 stars bc there is more variation of drinks/beers but also AJ was super sweet, attentive, and checked on our table all the time. Customer service is what makes this Umami burger stand out from the other umami's in LA that I've been to.",

I'm sure you could probably customize some burgers to your liking if the menu items don't tickle your fancy. I will definitely come back.",

    "text": "Foodwise, this was the best burger I've had in Vegas. We were staying across the street at the Hilton and after finding Unami on Bon Appetit's top 50 burgers list, I knew we had to roll over.  We came with a group of 8 and were easily seated outside at one of the picnic tables. Only disappointment with that is that we were seated on the far left side where there was no light. And it was bout 7pm and so it was dark. Would have been nice to be seated closer to the lit bar, or inside.  Drink specials during football season are amazing and so our beer drinkers were very pleased. I had a tequila/ginger beer cocktail that was delicious and well worth its $13 price tag.  Food wise, I had the cali burger and smothered fries. Everything was beyond delicious. The burger was thick and super juicy. I like the homemade american cheese and the caramelized onions were perfect. The smothered fries were heaven as the short rib was very tender and the gravy was super good. I had some of my cousin's beet salad and that was very good as well.   Service was my main reason for deducting a start as our server wasn't around very much. There would be long stints that she was gone, even though the restaurant was quite empty. She also quickly asked to process our check as she had tickets to a concert that night and wanted to leave as soon as she could. Made us feel really important.  Overall, I would definitely return for the food and atmosphere. This time I'll know better to request not to sit at the far end of the patio and will cross my fingers that there are no concerts going that night.",

I waited 10 minutes before my waitress came to the table to take my drink order. I ordered the pretzle, as that is why I came in the first place but was told they had run out earlier that day. Not quite sure how a restaurant runs out, but would have thought they would have made more instead of a certain quota since that is one item this place is known for. Ordered fried pickles and was disappointed that I only received 11 for $6 and don't expect your burger to come with any sides. My burger was $13 and it came with half a pickle spear. Only 6 oz burgers, but maybe that's before they're cooked as that burger didn't look like 6 oz to me.",
