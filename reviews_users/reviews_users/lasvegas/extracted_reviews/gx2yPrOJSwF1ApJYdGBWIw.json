This place is great! First off, I adore the atmosphere. It's very mellow and dark (as a ramen bar should.)       I've had my server Alex, 3 times and each time she was remarkably nice and very attentive. From what I can tell, so is the rest of the staff.      As for the food, in my opinion, Jinya does ramen right. The pork broth I had was flavorful and slightly thick. Noodles were on point. The Cha Sui pork slices melted in mouth and nothing is better than their seasoned egg. The appetizers we ordered, which consisted of Spicy tuna of crispy rice, crispy chicken, and pork Gyoza, were also all delicious!        If you're looking for genuine ramen, even if it's late night. Then Jinya is the place you need to go.",

We were both in the mood for ramen and had initially went to another ramen bar (our favorite) but the line was too long.  Made it here where their line was not as long.  After a relatively short wait we were seated.  The ambience was excellent.  Plenty of room for such a small venue and very clean.  They were quite busy for a Tuesday night but our server was prompt and quaint.  We both ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy bowl (I ordered my usual side of Kim Chee).  Very tasty.  Spoke with the manager after listening to her handle a guest who complained about the noodles (which I found annoying).  She was gracious during their exchange and I let her know that she did well not to lose her cool.  All in all I'll probably be paying future visits in the near future.",

But most of my co workers love to come here at least once a week after a long shift at work so this time I decided to come through. I was pretty impressed at how the place was set up. It was a very social setting with all tables kind of close and they had this huge square tables in the middle you could share with other patrons. The lighting was new and elegant and dimmed perfectly for the time of the night it was. My friend and I were the last to join the table. We saw them so we decided to just roll ride over without really talking to the hostess. Something I generally still wait for out of courtesy but my friend darted over there so I was like okay I'll follow (sorry hostess). I sat down in the seat next to our friends and my section of the table had sake spilled all in front of me and finished plates to my right. I was like oh it's ok like I sat myself this is obviously my fault. I didn't give them proper time to clean this up before I sat....BUT unfortunately it sat there for 20 more minutes as I sat there. I even got my order taken and it wasn't taken away.  I decided to stack up all the plates and cups for them nicely and push it to the right seat of me which was empty. And then I wiped the table with this napkin I also found laying around next to the plates and finally wiped all the sake off my area. I'm not sure if this was them punishing me for seating myself or maybe they just didn't see it but whatever I recognize half of it is my fault for seating early so you still get 4 stars. I would of gave you 5 even if someone picked it up in 10 minutes of me sitting. I'm pretty fair. The food was awesome by the way. And I recommend the Coedo Shiro beer. It goes well with everything on the menu.",

We had a group of 6, so we basically took up a corner of the large table. Not really ideal for seating.  For starters, I decided to go for the Jinya Pork Bun, which was amazing, as well as the Pork Gyoza, which was actually really good, probably the best gyoza I've had at a restaurant. For the main course, I had the Tonkatsu Black (Jinya No. 1), which had a very rich pork and garlic broth that felt a little salty at times. The pork and egg in the bowl was delicious and pretty much melted in my mouth.  Overall I think I would come back here again to try some other items on the menu.",

I haven't visited the restaurant first hand but having ordered togo a handful of times and had great food I'm sure dining in will yield a great result.

The broth is tasty.   Maybe a little salty for my taste but nonetheless it was enjoyable.   The noodles I have no complaints about either.   Where the stars went shooting from a 4 down to a 3 was the meat.  I got the one with chicken and they give like two fairly small pieces.   Chicken is cheap as hell.   Can I please have a semi respectable amount in my bowl???    It just feels like it's not proportionate.   And the chicken itself is nothing at all special.  But a brother needs some protein with his meals.    Honestly, I'd rather get pho than ramen.  So I won't be back.  But hey, to each their own.",

This ramen is good for a very biased and specific reason; Brussel sprouts. Before I continue to my favorite part, though, we had the Brussels sprout appetizer, the chicken bun, and the creamy tempura. The sprouts were lightly salted and super crunchy, so good. The chicken bun had an awesome sweetness and creaminess as well as a great texture. Every bite, you're met with the crunchiness of the outside of the chicken and the juicy, tenderness on the inside. The tempura was very good. The fidelity of the crunchiness was not compromised by the sauce. It wasn't soggy or hard. It was just right.   Now to my favorite part, the ramen. You're met with the usual umami: heavy pork flavor and al dente noodles. This ramen is excellent due to one thing: Brussel sprouts. The deep fried sprouts not only add texture, but the lightness and the bitterness of the sprouts refresh your palate. This is a ramen you can eat without getting fatigued. Get brussel sprouts!!!  Lastly I ordered the block bar. It's sweet lol.  Will eat again!!",

    "text": "This awesome ramen shop is only a few minutes drive from the strip. They are just off of Flamingo and Decatur. During my visit, I arrived for an early dinner so it wasn't crowded.  From their parking lot, I noticed a drive thru menu board but, it wasn't opened as a car was parked, blocking the entrance to the drive thru. Maybe it opens up later in the evening. I certainly hope so as this would be my favorite ramen place to go in Sin City! Imagine driving by and picking up some late night ramen before heading back to your hotel or home. What a concept! I'll have to make a return trip and confirm if see this is True.  Now for their ramen. Soup flavor excellent, ramen noodles al dente. Truly a favorite go to ramen spot while in Sin City. Take it from your ramen connoisseur, Jinya is worth a short drive from the strip. Enjoy!",

    "text": "One of my favorite ramen places in town.  Environment: The restaurant is located just up the street from the Palms casino and is in the general Chinatown area. The outside gives the impression of the place being small and the surroundings aren't exactly the prettiest setting ever but upon entering the decor is hip. They play trendy music, have nice lighting, and a variety of seating options including small booth, a communal table, and seats at the ramen bar. Jinya can get busy though so the limited seating does sometimes require a wait so be warned!  Food: While at most ramen places the most important thing is picking the right ramen, at Jinya the appetizers are just as good. Their jinya buns are amazing, the tebasaki was surprisingly delicious and although they don't have it anymore their crispy rice spicy tuna used to be great too! However, on to the ramen, I typically go with the tonkotsu black ramen, which has most of the ingredients I usually add to ramen anyway: garlic, hard-boiled egg, nori, etc. I have also tried the spicy chicken ramen, Cha Cha Cha ramen, and the sprouting up ramen, each of which is just as good.   Service: Service is generally good, especially for a fast-paced ramen spot. We had multiple employees checking up on us throughout our meal and I never felt like I was left needing something.  Overall, Jinya is one of my go-to ramen places, and I since the Monta location in Henderson shut down not too long ago I bet I will be coming here a little more frequently than usual!",

I would assume the food would be the same since it's the same company, but I was definitely let down this time. We ordered takoyaki, sweet potato \"fries,\" the chefs special tonkotsu and the tonkotsu black for me. I requested for no mushroom and when I received my ramen there were mushrooms as if they disregarded my request. Also the worst part was that there were pieces of egg shells on top of my egg. I was so shocked and upset that they didn't have quality control with their ramen. Not only was this such a disappointing experience, but the management just seemed so stand-offish like sheesh shouldn't you be able to accommodate to customers when it's their fault?  Never coming back when I'm in Vegas.",

I got to Vegas at 11:40 pm , and after checking in my hotel, I figured not too many good restaurants were still open. Luckily, JINYA opened until 3 AM, so i made a trip there.  Surprisingly, there were still lots of people waiting in front of the restaurant at 12:30 AM, and I also had to wait 30 minutes before I was seated.  Quality wise, the ramen was decent. I had the Tonkotsu black ramen. The broth was decent, the meat was decent. Every thing was decent. Not too bad and not very good in my opinion. The roasted seaweed was not crunchy so that was a minus.   It came out to be $14 including tax and tips. A pretty decent choice for late night dinner in Sin city.",

You're surrounded by fun knowing that although it's a spacious place to dine in, you get to vibe to the variety of entertainment they serve. For example, the music. They offer a diverse selection, it can be jazz, house, pop or even rap! The service is great! Though there is a line, they try cater to you as soon as they can. They give out smiles, warm welcoming, recommendations etc! A solid team for sure.   And hey, with great customer service comes fantastic food! I think that answers the question why there's always a line here, its good stuff!   I would definitely recommend this place to people who just wanna have fun while enjoying a fresh hot bowl of ramen! By the way, their menu is crafted to cater any of your cravings! From chicken wings to salads to rice and hey, even alcohol!   I've been here more than I even bothered checking in yelp, and it's always an awesome experience. With a place that opens till late? What more to ask? Till the next one!  -Arashai?!",

    "text": "A ramen chain in the West Coast. I decided to give myself a treat after my exam. I wanted to try the quinoa salad for some reason I forgot all about it when I saw Brussels sprouts on the menu.  Brussels Sprouts Tempura: My bad for not seeing the \"tempura\" part. I wanted a vegetable...fried veggies just don't make sense - what's the point? Aside from being deep-fat fried, these poor things are doused in truffle oil and heavily salted. After forcing ourselves to finish the sprouts, there was a good teaspoon-ful of oil at the bottom. Veggies aren't supposed to give you a heart attack. 2/5  Fried Chicken: Kara age. Lightly breaded but extremely oily and salty - Soul Glo oily. The pieces of chicken were not dry. 2/5  Jinya Bun: Pork belly bao. You get a nice thick piece of pork belly with sauce, Japanese mayo and greens. 4/5  Tonkotsu Black: Pork broth with chashu, kikurage, green onions, nori, seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion and thin noodles. Probably one of the best bowl of ramen I've had in Vegas. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was excellent because of the garlic. 5/5  The service was good and the place is typical of a ramen bar. I appreciate the variety on their menu. The ramen was great and they are a ramen bar. But man, the oilyness and saltiness of the appetizers were unforgivable. We walked out with our lips all pale and feeling so bloated after eating all that salt. My hair smelled like oil the whole day. I would still come back for the ramen and nothing else though.",

We walked in, were seated quickly and the server asked us if we have been there before. My bf and I said no and her response was \"hmmm interesting.\" Uh wtf is that supposed to mean and what happened to \"welcome thank you for joining us.\" Are you guys so freaking well known that you are appalled that we've never eaten there before? That just put the rest of my dinner experience downhill, and honestly just straight pissed me off.   Tempura Brussel Sprouts: You could smell the truffle oil and garlic right when it got to the table. Batter wasn't too heavy and it was fried perfectly.   Tonkatsu assari The noodles had a good, firm texture but not too hard. The broth was rich and creamy. My favorite part of eating ramen is the soft boiled egg, which I always save for last. This was cooked perfectly as well.  Pork chasu bowl This was good, but the pork was a little tough in my opinion.   Mid meal, the initial server who put me in a bad mood had to go home, so she introduced us to our new server. She was nice and I'm glad we got someone new. I hope the tip we left went to her and not the first girl. As you can see, their food is great, but that one girl brought my whole experience down. If I come back, I hope I don't get the same server.",

I got it without onion and I added an egg. They have 3 levels of hot/spicy, and I went with the hottest. It wasn't unbearable, but it had a good kick, in my opinion it was just right. The bean sprouts added crunch, I couldn't really taste the spinach, the chicken was moist and there was a good amount of noodles. It was the perfect serving size and left me satisfied.  Went to the bathroom before leaving and found myself in awwww of the toilet that sat before me. This toilet was the king of all toilets, and was amazing! This thing was huge, lit up when I came in and the seat cover lifted on its own. It cleaned itself for me and was ready to go. I sat down to find a heated seat cushion and control panel to my left. Awesome! They had rinse, spray, and all kinds of gadgets for your bathroom experience. A must try. =) The service was good, they all seemed happy and were friendly inside. The interior was nice and hip inside. Totally not what I expected from seeing the exterior of the building.   So if you're in Vegas and want some delicious ramen, stop on by.",

I like that the menu has several different appetizers that you wouldn't usually find at a ramen spot.. We enjoyed the spicy tuna on crispy rice.. The spicy tuna did not have any kind of \"fishy\" taste and the crispy rice was perfectly fried. I recommend trying the chicken ramen.. You don't see that everywhere and the broth was surprisingly just as creamy and rich as the pork broth.. I do, however, prefer the pork chashu that comes with the pork ramen VS the chicken that comes with the chicken ramen.   Service was good but we did get a few plates that were not properly cleaned.. :/  HOT TIP: There is no drive-thru.. they should take their sign down lol",

    "text": "Oooh fancy fancy! I'm not going to pretend I didn't eat a ton of the .25 cent packages of Top Ramen back in the day.. but now that I am older, I am all about this fancy ramen and JINYA is my favorite place to slurp up some curly noodles.  My first visit to JINYA was with some of my favorite Yelpers, Jessica M. and Dyanna L., both who had made multiple visits to JINYA and were able to guide me through ordering. I have since returned with my husband and every experience has been excellent. Never too long a wait to be seated, friendly and efficient service and the ambiance is quite nice as well.  The chicken ramen is my go-to order, the broth is so flavorful. I always get some additions to customize my order: I love adding butter, mushrooms, corn and LOTS of freshly pressed garlic.  JINYA has more than ramen, the tempura brussel sprouts are a must get, they are amazing.   For your late night, party animal types: JINYA is open until 3 am, and has Happy Hour from 3-5pm AND 10pm-12am!   Pro tip: Do not leave without checking out the restroom.",

    "text": "Maybe ramen really is the new pizza!  It's kind of mind blowing how I was dying for just one legit ramen joint in Las Vegas only a few years back and now I could do a week straight without going to the same spot.  I'd also have to chug 500 gallons of water during said week but still....  I was looking for a basic, no frills ramen and their \"Tonkotsu Assari\" fit that bill perfectly.  Our server also mentioned it was his favorite.  Assari consisted of pork broth, chashu, green onion, egg and bean sprouts, but the thick noodles were the clincher for me.  Most of Jinya's ramen offerings come with thin noodles which I am usually not down with although I didn't ask if they would substitute.    It's a good thing they put me at a corner table since I slurped my face off.  From top to bottom, it was solid through and through.  There is better chashu to be had in town, but this was still a nice bowl of satisfaction.  I'd also skip the salad (dressing was gross) plus gyoza add-on and opt for another tapas dish instead.    To my knowledge, Jinya is also the first and only spot in Vegas to do takoyaki the right way.  I've had so many awful versions of it since moving from Japan that I had given up hope.  I was delirious after my first bite!  The light crunch, generous chunks of octopus with its signature sauce, mayonnaise and dried bonito flakes put my taste buds on another planet.  It was a terrific dish that I will be having multiple times in the future.  Love that they're open until 3am!!    Good call with giving only the ladies the nice Toto toilet.  :P",

The tonkatsu spicy is made with their thick noodles and the black is made with their thin noodles. I liked the broth of the spicy but preferred the thin noodles that come with the tonkatsu black ramen. Next time I'll order the tonkatsu spicy with the thin noodles. Overall, both good ramens.  I highly recommend the Pork Chashu and kimchee tacos! The pork is nice and tender combined with a great crunch from the fried taco shells. The kimchee adds a nice saltiness to the tacos. An order comes with 2 tacos and is a perfect appetizer.   Service is very quick and attentive. The restaurant was packed but our food came out quick and easy. Good experience overall.",

The menu selections here are also plentiful with traditional ramen and rice bowls, along with familiar dishes with a Jinya twist on them, and even a few tasty tapas style dishes.  We started off with a Jinya Bun, Mini Chashu Bowl, and the Tempura Brussels Sprouts with Truffle Oil.The bun was very tasty, and the sprouts were delicious too, things we'd probably order again. However, the Chashu Bowl IMO doesn't top the one found at Ramen Sora even though Jinya's version is a tad bit bigger with a soft boiled egg.  Our waiter suggested the seasonal Chicken-Lime & Cilantro Ramen, so we split that. Although the flavors were good. It had more of a Vietnamese/Chinese flavor to me.Looking to try the more traditional type ramen when we return. Great service, open until 3 am, and solid food overall...we'll be back!  ALOHA!!!

They have chicken as well which is what I prefer. You can make your ramen from mild to spicy. You also have your choice of veggies to put in your ramen like broccoli, bean sprouts, spinach etc. The flavor is amazing and the serving is generous. The chicken is all white meat, juicy and tender. It's a little off the strip but just about 5-10 min depending on traffic. Completely worth it. Also I recommend to get here early or you might have to wait a while, it can get packed.",

Jinya is open until 3 am and thus one of these places. It is always, always worth it.   The restaurant is bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. There are regular tables, a bar, and a big table in the middle, at which customers sit with other random customers. Jinya may be a little on the dimly lit side, but then I guess that's the atmosphere they're going for as a barstaurant. The servers are speedy, helpful, and friendly. Drinks are kept refilled and orders are taken immediately. The cooking time is also reasonable. I've never had to wait longer than 13 minutes for my order, regardless of how busy the place was.  And then of course, there is the ramen. Sweet, sweet Jinya ramen. The egg is one of my favorite parts. It is cooked just enough for it to be solid on the outside and smooth and soft on the inside - just the way I love it! Each serving of ramen comes with thick well-cooked noodles and plenty of meat, no short-selling there. Actually, can we talk about how the prices are crazy low for the huge portions of ramen that are served here? I have never come out of this restaurant anything less than full. In fact, I sometimes wish I had a little more room left for dessert, that's how big the portions are.    My only gripe about this place are the windows: The one time I was here during noon, the sun was shining through the windows so badly that my friends were practically blinded throughout their entire meal. I'd love if this place adjusted their blinds a little so that wouldn't happen to people sitting on the window side during lunch. That by itself is not worth a downvote, though. 5 stars from me!",

We could see a table in front of us, but they weren't sure if they had a 4 top.   The server came around pretty quickly once we were seated. Our server, though, was not particularly helpful. When I asked her what were the best dishes (her recommendation) she just pointed to the the three biggest pictures on the menu without much explanation.   I ordered the Jinya No3 with extra ground pork and fresh garlic. The Jinya No3 was great as the broth was not too thick like some ramens are. The fresh garlic was a nice touch. It just comes out in bulbs and they hand you the press and you can press it in yourself, which was nice. I don't think the ground pork added much to the ramen, however. For some reason, it didn't have a fresh taste. Maybe a little old.  Friends of ours had ordered spicy ramen with extra noodles. Their dish came out and it didn't look spicy at all (just plain yellow broth). When they asked the server if it was spicy, she wasn't sure herself. She didn't check either. She just assumed it was. She also had to be reminded to bring extra noodles.   Overall, it was good Ramen. Personally, I'm a bigger fan of Pho than Ramen. Just be sure that you are on top of your order.",

We waited 40 minutes and asked different waiters and they all said they are making our food now it will be out shortly. The last guy said that our food doesn't hold priority since we aren't dining in. There were multiple groups that sat down and got their food before us. I understand waiting for our food but telling us that our food doesn't hold priority and waiting that long is ridiculous! If this was the case they should tell the customer. And lastly when I did get my food it was the wrong broth. I will not be back nor recommend this place.",

I had the miso black ramen combo with crispy chicken and house salad with a jinya bun and their ice cream flan for dessert.   The ramen was too fatty for my taste and the chashu was a bitty fatty as well. The crispy chricken had a nice flavor but that too was heavy and oily after a few pieces. The jinya bun was mediocre at best, as it was just sweet. The desert was very good and was the saving grace of this being a 1 Star.   ...Side note this meal left me with the fattest headache for the rest of the day, so I don't think I'll be back when I have my ramen craves.",

I am particularly fond of the fresh garlic that you hand press for your soup. My latest visit, they changed the press used for it and I had an embarrassingly long time figuring it out, but I did it! The struggle made it more rewarding.  I usually get the chicken broth. It's quite rich from what I am used to, but it's still a great treat. Read carefully what each ramen includes because they all have different vegetables and meat. I'm used to ramen spots having the same across the board with different broths.  I enjoy spicy ramen, but can never know if a restaurant's spiciest level will be too much for me. I ordered medium and it wasn't enough, so if you are like me and can handle say an 8/10, get the spiciest level because their medium is a 4/10 in my opinion. They also have bonus spicy condiments if you want to gradually bring it to your ideal level.  My favorite appetizers that you need to try are their pork buns, shrimp tempura, and the brussels sprouts tempura. Yum!!",

Probably seats 25 people comfortably. It took us 30 minutes to sit which was okay. It's a very chill vibe and they play good pop music while I was eating. But I went here again because my friend told me the pork chashu bowl was amazing and I also tried one of each of the mini tacos. The pork, salmon, and spicy tuna. The spicy tuna one was really spicy to me, the pork one was decent, but the salmon was my favorite. Btw you only get 2 little tacos per order on one little wonton strip. I don't think it's worth the price but I wanted to try it. But yeah the salmon one was bomb. The pork chashu bowl was amazing!!!!!! I loved it so much. They got a regular and mini size. The pork is flavored in this Teri sauce and it was so good! It comes with rice and green onions and some other greens and 2 halves of a egg. I really loved how the bowl went together. Would definitely come back for that. That bowl is definitely 10/10",

I tipped over 20% to be nice , we got our food in a good time and it wasn't disgusting. But wow show your waitresses how to be a little nicer ?",

Though our waiter/waitress wasn't consistently one person, they were all great.  The menu has various ramen options that are separated by tonkotsu, chicken, and vegetable. Apparently their JINYA bun is popular, but we just were too full. They also have some interesting items such as mini tacos and BlockPops.  +SPROUTING UP RAMEN: This may not be the most traditional ramen, but I absolutely loved the brussel sprouts in here; they added some crunch. The broth is also rich and creamy and overall a wholesome ramen bowl.  All in all, the ramen shop offers some delicious albeit possibly non-traditional ramen. I would love to return to try some of their other non-ramen offerings because they also sound tasty.",

At first I was a little uncomfortable because I thought the toilet had a bidet then I warmed up to the idea.. See what I did there?!  Let's get down to business. Let me start off by saying I was not hungry when I stepped through the door. As we waited, I noticed how busy it was and the hostesses said 20 minutes is nothing. They also said that sometimes there is a 2 hour wait and mentioned how much people enjoy Jinya. As we were seated, I noticed how they do not have TV's set up and seat you at a giant table.  We came at the right time because it was happy hour and they have a decent amount of food to choose from. I got kimchi tacos. They were enjoyable but a little too salty for my taste. The list of ramen had my mouth watering at that point. I got the Cha Cha Cha. It was delightful because of how garlicky it was. My favorite thing on the menu had got to be the noodle refill. I can't tell you how many times I've thought how delightful it would be to be to add more noodles to all the broth I have left over because I'm a monster.  I didn't mind the wait and I can't wait to use the restroom here again.",

    "text": "I've been trying to go to Jinya for a couple of years, but it is always packed! I finally made it in to Jinya a couple of weeks ago and had a really great experience.  I don't always like to rate a place unless I've gone on multiple occasions, but I do sometimes when I feel like I tried enough of the food.  Jinya is within the China Town area of Las Vegas right off the strip on Tropicana. The plaza it's in isn't the best looking one in Vegas, and neither is the outside of the establishment. The restaurant itself is modern inside and very clean. The one gripe I have with the decor is the huge community table in the middle of the space.  Jinya is a Japanese restaurant that specializes in ramen. With this huge surge in ramen joints the last few years I see Jinya standing the test of time. They have a great menu with many different ramen with varying flavor profiles and spice levels. They also have a bunch of tasty appetizers.   I'm a classic ramen type of person: I like a savory broth with tons of flavor & some corn for some sweetness.   I suggest taking your time reading the menu and figuring out what sounds best to you. A unique choice I enjoyed was their sukiyaki ramen with poached egg. An appetizer I'd recommend is their takoyaki. It's become such a popular dish, but theirs is served with egg salad underneath-such a good flavor combination.   Jinya only had a handful of people working their floor, but they're incredibly attentive and nice. I love how they have some starter dishes for around $5/$6 bucks. I thought Jinya was just hype, but I really enjoyed myself and their food.",

It definitely seems like a \"cool\" place for the under 30 to eat Vegas' latest food craze.    But honestly,  it wasn't quite worth the hype it got.  There was a 10 minute wait when we got there at 9pm on a Sunday,  and the wait staff seemed run down and overwhelmed by so many people... but I hear they're always busy, so you'd think they'd have it down by now.  They were out of EVERY sake.  Not just one sake... every sake.  The ramen was pretty good.  A lot of choices,  and the tonkotsu black was better than the chef special chicken I had.  I don't think the noodles are home made,  but they still taste good.  The chef chicken special was hard to eat.  Chicken pieces so big I really wanted a knife and fork to cut them up.  Try getting a bite out of a semi tough piece of chicken while holding it with chopsticks and trying to remain a lady... impossible! Even the bamboo shoots were huge.  I had to bite it down 5 times!   All in all I'd be back if I lived on the west side.",

It consisted of baby greens, kale, broccoli, quinoa, garbanzo and red beans in some sort of creamy dressing. The portion wasn't huge, which is nice and it hit the spot.   I'll have to come back one day and try out the ramen. Seems like everyone else in the restaurant ordered it and left the bowl empty. A good sign!",

It definitely wasnt the same experience but it was still good.  The taste just wasn't the same for some reason.  The thing I really enjoy about Jinya is that they seem to have an understanding for my love for garlic!  They give you whole garlic with a garlic masher and its totally free of charge.  You can have fried garlic added to your ramen as well, with garlic oil.  Omg the vampire in me just dies everytime!  But, since we came with dad of course we had a pretty nice spread of food.  So we got to try a bunch of things.  All were very good, very tasty.  And I think we got in right in time for happy hour too so the buns, tacos and gyoza might have been from that happy hour menu.  Take advantage especially if you have a group.  The staff were very attentive, kept the waters full and orders were on point.  Parking is conveniently super close but there arent a lot of stalls.  They have a private bathroom but its pretty dim inside so not too sure how clean it was but it didnt smell...  prices were alright.  I definitely recommend esp if youre into garlic and ramen like I am!",

I just wish they would either make their pork slices thicker or even have more than just two flimsy pieces.  But other than that, amazing!  The gyozas are always delish.  This trip, I also ordered the Spicy Creamy Shrimp Tempura and OMG, I think I just had an orgasm in my mouth!  At first I was obsessed with the seasoned egg, now the spicy creamy shrimp tempura has taken its place.  I love this place!  I wish they would make this place bigger.  With a small space and it being busy, during this visit, it bothered us watching how the waitresses were seating the customers.  Clearly, a two top was seated at a table for four when they could have clearly seated them at the big community table.  But whatev's.    With all that being said, Happy Eating's!",

    "text": "Yaassssss! I finally found another decent ramen place to add to my list in Vegas. Thanks to my friend's recommendation, I was able to finally check out JINYA.   This place was ridiculously delicious, but a little pricey for Vegas prices. For a party of two with one appetizer, we spent about $37 bucks with tip and tax. Who would have thought that sin city had some good ramen places, huh? JINYA would be in the top 3 ramen places in Vegas. The place was also well-decorated too and had a nice hipster vibe to mesh with the overall atmosphere.   JINYA was generous with portions and offered a huge variety of topping options. I ordered the JINYA Tonkotsu Black with thick noodles. I enjoyed the noodles as they were perfectly cooked and chewy. The broth was decent, but unfortunately, the flavor wasn't as delicious as Monta's Black Tonkotsu version. It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. As far as flavoring and taste goes, it's a solid 3.5-4/5. The noodles, meat and seasoned egg were a solid 5/5.  We also ordered the fried Shrimp Balls, which I highly recommend! It had just the right amount of crunch, shrimp and cream cheese that made it beyond orgasmic.  Overall, this place is a solid choice to dine for a quick bite. We went on Monday around 5 and were seated quickly. If I had to wait in line for this place, I probably wouldn't wait more than 20 minutes. The service was attentive and friendly, especially when we told them it was our first time at the restaurant! Our waters were always constantly refilled and they routinely checked up on us to see how things were going.",

    "text": "After a late night workout, I was hungry for some ramen and around this time (10:30 PM), many ramen places seemed to be closing. After yelping out some places, I found JINYA which seemed to have good reviews, not too far from where I was, and opened till 3 AM.  The location had a lot of parking and the spot seemed quite busy. Some people were waiting outside the door so I kinda got iffy to dine in, assuming that the wait was long. Asked the hostess how long the wait was and she said 15 mins so I went ahead and reserved a spot.   In less than 10 min, my boyfriend and I were able to get a seat. The atmosphere was great; lighting was dim (I didn't mind it) and I really enjoyed the music playing.   Our server was able to assist us pretty quick from the time we sat down. We didn't know but it was happy hour at this time so we got the crispy chicken and the salmon taco. We enjoyed both and I definitely loved their mini salmon taco!  As for the ramen, I got the chef's Tokyo Tonkatsu Ramen and my bf got the same one but the Tonkatsu Ramen Black (soup base was a little different). Both tasted great, good toppings, and the soup base was delish! We finished the whole thing! Definitely gonna hit this place up again.",

    "text": "So So Jinya!  I'm pretty new to this Ramen craze and before dining at Momofuku at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas I decided to take my friend girl up on her offer for a \"ramen\" lunch introduction.  I want to like Jinya honest I do but there were way to many service failures to count Sunday afternoon that took away from the overall experience. Side Note: majority of my friends rave about this place being phenomenal. Returning is a gamble at this time!!!  Main: I ordered Vegetable Ramen ($10) and it was just okay. I asked for spicy but I don't think that was communicated very well. No hint of spice in sight!  My friend ordered a \"chef special\" chicken ramen ($11.00) which comes with half egg. After a short debate with our server about ordering an additional half egg to her order; the ramen arrived with no eggs at all! Awkward! Appetizers: Caramelized Cauliflower ($6.20)was by far the best item ordered. Bold flavor and the pine nuts were a great addition. The chickpeas were loaded with cumin. A bit too much to be honest but I did enjoy them!  We ordered Spicy Creamy Shrimp ($7.80) which literally arrived at the end of our meal. The server came by two additional times and acknowledged she forgot the remainder appetizer as she continued to forget! Flavorful and delicious but late af! Dessert:  I ordered the Panna Cotta ($3.50) which was also blah! The graham cracker topping and ice cream taste like it was uncovered in a fridge for quite some time. My friend ordered a block pop ($3.80) which arrived unwrapped and a little moist like it sat out a few minutes (she shared this dessert is always wrapped).   The icing on the cake was our server coughing directly into her hands before setting up the small table next to us without washing her hands. She touched the napkins and the spoons. I'm no sanitation police but this was totally unacceptable!  Not sure the total because my friend felt bad recommending the place and took care of the tab!",

It has that trendy, industrial vibe. The music is pretty cool too.  I got the cha cha cha and I regretted it. I love garlic but the blend wasn't good at all. The broth wasn't hot in temperature. It was almost cold which made the experience unenjoyable. At first the broth tasted really good. It's pork and fish based. I guess after blending all the other ingredients, it tasted bitter and couldn't taste the flavor at all. The pork was really good. It tasted just right. The egg was good. I think it was suppose to have a garlic flavor but it tasted like a regular egg. The noodles were thick which I didn't really enjoy. Something wasn't right and I can't really point it out but I wouldn't recommend the cha cha cha.   The service was great. They were attentive. They came often to refill your water and see how you were doing. The people were nice.   I would come back again but I would try something different.",

    "text": "Was not a fan of these guys.  Was excited to check it out based on the recommendations of a friend but left disappointed with the quality and especially the staff.  I really love late night ramen and it was cool to see these guys open so late, and we came by right around midnight for a late dinner.  I got the garlic ramen and it was decent but I would argue there actually wasn't enough garlic with it.  The noodles were okay as well but nothing special, and the price/value overall was fairly average.  Overall, it was fine and definitely filling, but the flavor was a bit lacking.  The staff was where I had the real problem, though.  Our waitress couldn't be bothered in the slightest with us and barely spoke to us while taking our order.  We really never saw her again as other servers came to refill our drinks and such.  We ordered two appetizers we didn't receive until we brought them up twice and they arrived after we had almost finished our ramen, and my wife didn't get a drink she ordered until late as well.  The waitress also mixed up our check with another one and added items onto ours that we didn't order.  When we went up to talk to her and a manager about the bill and the lack of service, we were met with indifference and no effort to make things right.  I'm not usually one to complain about wait staff because I know it's a hectic job and I don't leave crappy reviews for for things like waiting a few extra minutes and such, but this was not acceptable, at all.  With so many other excellent ramen options in Vegas, we will not come back to Jinya.",

That being said, a year ago Jinya was my go to spot for ramen, but the quality of food seemed to decline as the months went on. It's either that or maybe things just weren't consistent, which is a no go for me. So, I started to go elsewhere. Fast forward to last week in which an impromptu lunch date landed me here, and let's just say everything is back to being perfect!!   The noodles in my spicy chicken ramen were cooked perfectly, not too overdone that is (I can't stand soggy noodles); the shrimp balls were golden & crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside; and although they were out of jinya buns, the karaage chicken being fried to perfection definitely made up for it. Customer service had also improved and everything came quickly and correctly.   It's safe to say Jinya is back to being my favorite!! Although I wish they'd  bring back the tofu dessert, it's definitely not a deal breaker.",

Cute ramen shop with lots of different ramen bases and add ins to choose from! It was so late that I don't exactly remember the name of what we got, but I did get a white...tonkotsu base? And my be got something with hellllaaaa garlic. All you need to know is that the flavors were reaaaallllyyyyy good! We also got the pork buns as an appetizer and I'm fairly happy with those also!   I feel as if the cuts of meat were generous, but I still have lots of love for My OG spot in Vegas- Monta Ramen. Monta is a more simplistic ramen with good cuts of porkbelly and relatively basic but delicious add ins. I'd have to say that JINYA is unique for the different flavors, the atmosphere with great service, and the attention to detail with their ramen. Definitely try this place out!

    "text": "Really just so so.  There are such super great reviews on this restaurant - my conclusion is that the selection of good ramen places in Vegas are limited and compared to all, they maybe good?  To start with, majority of the patrons (90%) are non Asian, at least at the lunch time we were there, thus my guess is that the reviews are really not the Asian standards of what a good bowl of ramen should be.  It is so great that they have a kids menu.  For $7.50, you get a small bowl of chicken ramen with corn and spinach; 2 crispy chicken, small bowl of chicken and rice, slice of orange, lollipop and a small vanilla ice cream.  I would say that was the highlight of the whole meal.  For the adults, we ordered the Tokyo ramen special, which is just the to tonkatsu (pork) soup base with skinny ramen noodles with cha siu and a soft boiled egg.  If you were to go to an authentic ramen place, they would boil the broth for each table, not just scooped out the broth from a big pot.  At this place, you know they just scooped the broth out and assemble the toppings and bring it to the table.  Out ramen came quick before our appetizers (hint).  The broth was not hot (which it should be).  Disappointed!!!  Now come the food - we ordered the Brussels sprouts tempura, it was really good because they put truffle oil in their tempura batter so it was very fragrant.  The crispy chicken was also tasty.  Authentic Tonkatsu broth should be white or close to it, it was brown so assume they add quiet a bit of soy sauce, which made the broth quiet salty.  Oh and by the way, everyone in the kitchen was non Asian.  OH AND there are no Japanese restaurant (at least not the authentic Japanese restaurant) that will charge you $1 for tea.  Tea or water supposed to be complimentary.  We are not at an American restaurant asking for a cup of tea or coffee that is on the menu.  Very disappointed considering we purposely took uber to come for this ramen place which supposedly have such great review",

It isn't bad by any means, I just think there are a few places up the street that work that ramen magic better.   But go here for happy hour! They have their JINYA bun on HH and it's awesome. Two of those and a glass of Sapporo and you're good to go for lunch",

I came here with two other people and waited about 15 minutes for a table because we didn't want to sit at the big table. I love when hosts/servers keep you updated on the status of a table when they can!   We had gyozas and a pitcher of Sapporo. Everyone ordered the tonkotsu black. The only thing I didn't like about it is the thin noodles but that's customizable so that's what I'll change next time! The egg is absolutely perfect. I love that there is fried garlic because it adds so much flavor! The broth is just to my liking. I can't wait to come back.   Oh yeah, their ladies room is really cool! make sure to check it out. My boyfriend said the men's room was nothing special tho.. LOL  And little do I know... They have jinya's in LA. So I'll make sure to check it out here too.",

I don't know what is going on but you are made to feel completely unwanted and it is an inconvenience your there.

Dining alone can sometimes be a daunting task, but I am quite used to it. Often, servers and staff don't know exactly how to treat someone dining alone, but the staff at JINYA did a perfect job. They weren't all over me trying to fill the silence, but they were ever present and anticipated all of my needs. My server was fabulous, but the entire staff worked together to check in on me and make sure all my needs were taken care of. My drink was ALWAYS full and multiple people checked up on me to make sure everything was to my liking. I work in the restaurant industry so it takes a bit to impress me. This was some of the best service I've had in my life. The food was also phenomenal and the server knew the menu inside and out and made some wonderful suggestions. 10/10 will be dining here again soon.",

The salad was served in chilled bowls, making it nice and refreshing. But dressing tasted like shoyu. The gyozas were good and the curry was decent. My grandma and bf liked the ramen. I didn't care for it much cause a few bites in I started to feel sick. Decided to take the rest home, figured might be too much oil for my tummy.

    "text": "JINYA needs to get its shit together. This used to be my favorite Ramen spot in Vegas but the customer service has completely deteriorated.  I just got done waiting 45 minutes to potentially be seated and still had 6 groups in front of me.  The managing of customers waiting needs to improve if I ever come back here.  Not one person greeting people at the door, 0 communication, empty tables that SHOULD be in use, and people are just sitting around at their table staring at their check.  I decided to leave and I know a lot of people did the same after I told them about other places to eat around town. If you're reading this,  bored as hell in line at JINYA, just leave and go to Pho Kim Long or Sora down the street. At some point,  you have to recycle people out and get new people in or at least reassure your customers that you fucking care. Unfortunately JINYA has become a joke. Embarrassing.",

Sushi Ida bit on the bland side but I don't go for that. It's called ramen house for a reason. I recommend it highly.",

    "text": "My first time visiting was on Saturday night. I caught a movie at the Palms and decided to head over and try out some Ramen. I've had Pho before and it was delicious but I knew deep down in my heart I'd love Ramen more and boy was I right! This place was amazing! I went around the happy hour time of 10pm-12am and started off with some hot Sake for only $5. Talk about a good buzz for cheap. I was floating with the stars and still had plenty to share with my girlfriend. I ended up ordering the Crispy Chicken Appetizer and the Spicy Chicken Ramen at the hottest level. That chicken was so perfectly fried and seasoned and the sauce they serve with it was out of this world. I loved every bit of it! Now let's get to the Ramen. The broth...... OMG. It was savory and bold in flavor and is exactly what I like. I ordered the Seasoned Egg and also added Ground Chicken (Can't remember the exact name on the menu) =( and I was beyond satisfied. Our server was great and checked on us periodically and the overall atmosphere was chill and relaxed with dim lighting. I will definitely be back here on a regular basis. My GF also taught me how to use chop sticks that night so that made it even a greater experience. I felt like an idiot looking at everyone going to work while I was the only one who had a fork in my hand lol. I'm not sure what some of the bad reviews are about but just know you can't please everyone so don't hesitate to give this place a try!  -P.S. I'm a Chef so take my word for it. I know what good food tastes like ;-) (Instagram: Thekitchenleroux)",

I ordered the spicy chicken ramen and there was a piece of HAIR stuck and wrapped around one of the wontons in the soup. I was beyond DISGUSTED. I have never experienced this at any restaurant before. The waiter did not offer to bring me a new bowl of ramen when I notified him about the disgusting matter. He instead made a joke about stating that it could've been his hair (he is a young white male with long hair). Unfortunately I do not remember his name. I was forced to pay for this unsanitary meal and the manager never came out to speak to me about the matter which is an absolute no-no. I work in hospitality myself and this has never gone on at my restaurant and if in fact there is any reason the customer is not satisfied, our manager comes out immediately to accommodate the customers needs and to express sincere apologies. This restaurant obviously does not know the meaning of hospitality and does NOT care about their customers. What a DISGUSTING establishment. For my first time trying ramen, I was horrified with this experience and all I can picture is that nasty strand of hair in my food. I am beyond traumatized and feel gross. This place needs a visit from the health department.",

We started off by ordering the crispy chicken appetizer and our waiter said that it would be happy hour within 10 minutes and he could place it then so we agreed.  In the meantime we each placed our order for ramen.  We got our ramen but not the chicken even after we finished eating the ramen and by that time at least 30 min had passed from the time that our waiter said he would place that chicken order.    Another server saw that we needed water refills and said he would come back with it than our waiter also passed by and offered to have it refilled but minutes passed and no refill...finally that other server realized he forgot and came back.    We finally asked for the check and we weren't charged for the chicken appetizer because it obviously was never placed.  As we were leaving I told the server and he said \"do you still want it?  It's coming out\" and I said \"no\" because clearly we were leaving and how could it be coming out if it was never placed.  There are so many other ramen noodle places in this city that provide much better service than this one!",

Now why in the hell would you stack something heavy on top of something light?!

    "text": "It was a rainy day in Vegas & I knew I needed ramen stat. JINYA had been chillin' in my bookmarks for a while now so I thought it was time to give it a try. I wasn't surprised to see a lot of people waiting outside & inside the restaurant. It's a quaint place so there wasn't really a designated waiting area or chairs at all. The set up of the restaurant is pretty unique. A counter facing the kitchen, tables on all sides of the restaurant & then a massive rectangular wooden table surrounded by stools is in the center of the restaurant. Heads up for large parties-- this is the only place you really can sit at so don't expect to eat facing each other, you'll most likely be sitting side by side & there will probably be a longer wait to accommodate you, although turnaround is quite fast since it's ramen.  Anyway, onto the customer service. It was a really busy night so I pretty much people-watched while we waited for our table. Hostesses were so-so. Not exactly chipper but not entirely rude either. It also wasn't clear who's who. Servers sat people, hostesses took orders. However, it was as organized as it could get for a packed house. Our server Rachel was really sweet. She handled orders for the whole big rectangular table with ease.   Lastly, the food was yummy! I ordered the Premium Tonkotsu White & the fiance had the Chef's Special Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen. There wasn't much of a difference between ours except for the supposed spicy sauce on mine and fish powder on his. The pork chasu freaking melts in your mouth. MMMM. The taste of the broth was pretty identical for us. One complaint is our ramens were not as hot as we would have wanted. Even with us moving the toppings quickly, the broth was only warm. Also, of course I agree with everyone here. Takoyaki is BOMB & the egg salad at the bottom is just icing on the cake.  Prices are a tad higher than other ramen bars in town but that's what you get for eating at a super hip ramen bar right? All in all, I'm sure I'll be back. Vegas just needs to stay colder for a little bit more. :)",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to trying out Jinya since I read a good amount of positive reviews on Yelp.  We arrived at about 5 PM on 11/24, before heading out to catch our flight back home.  We were seated pretty much right away since it was a Monday and we happened to show up during their happy hour which is from 3-6 PM, I believe.  I decided to order the pork ear chicharones as an appetizer, since it looked really interesting from the picture on the menu.  My son loves hot sauce so we were hoping that it would be one of those items we'd come back for on our future visits.  It pretty much tasted like they just drenched tapatio sauce all over it.  It wasn't spicy at all so we won't be trying that again.  We both ordered a bowl of the tonkotsu spicy ramen, my son went for spicy while I opted for medium.  The broth was pretty good, but you can see that extra layer of fat once your broth gets cold which I'm not too crazy about.  The noodles were really firm to the point where it seemed undercooked.  Maybe I will ask to have them cook it longer next time.  Overall, I would come back if I need a ramen spot that stays open late, but if it's during regular business hours...I'll continue to enjoy my ramen at Ramen Sora.",

    "text": "I finally decided to give this place a shot. The wait is usually kind of long after 5 so make sure to plan for that. First of all, the service was not that great. Myself and two friends went and we all ran out of water and had to flag someone down for awhile to fill them.   Happy hour has some sweet deals though. Got sake for $5 and some apps;  Takoyaki - I love takoyaki. And I've eaten it too many times to count. It wasn't served hot at all which made me sad. Good, but I've had better. (Poku poku has amazing takoyaki! :p)  Pork chashu w/ kimchee - I was very confused. It didn't taste like kimchi at all nor was there any kimchi in it. The pork was good though.   JINYA bun - I enjoyed this a lot. The pork was very juicy and melted in my mouth.   Now, for the ramen, I got;  JINYA Tonkatsu black - really appreciated the broth. I could really tell how long it took to get that type of flavor into that broth. I've had many salty broths at other Ramen spots and this wasn't overpowering. I also love garlic. They allow you to put freshly squeezed garlic in it! I also got butter and corn in my soup. The butter was huge!  I didn't meant to put the entire thing in... but oh well. I loved the garlic chips.   After eating it took a long time for the check. Then our server was non existent. Someone else came with our check and set it down on the table. Not one person said here you go. Or thank you! Or having a nice day! Nothing. So that bummed me out. Overall it was all good food. I will be back to try some other stuff.",

    "text": "3rd visit. Most likely the last. There are too many other great ramen places where the service may be quick paced and slightly impersonal - but you actually do get service, and you get what you ask for.   Jinya - The speed in which the food arrives has much improved since previous visits. The demeanor of our server - as if he \"couldn't be bothered\" - was pretty frustrating. Twice, he held his finger up at me from a distance as if to say \"just a second\" while he dance and laughed with others servers 2 feet from our table. It wasn't as though he was busy with guests. So that's just annoying and uncool. You are a server, please provide service or move on. Honestly. It's not rocket science.   Asking for items to come as a first course made no difference - as everything showed up either all together or appetizers after the ramen bowls hit the table. Again, not the biggest deal - but communicate to your table if that's the case. It becomes a situation where the lack of proper service has you noticing everything that is not right. We ordered a pitcher of beer and sake and the server never came back to check on us when they were done - make sales dude!   It's hard to review the food with such  bad taste in   your mouth due to lack of service. Next.   Happy Eating!",

One of my best friends (who is pescatarian) has been to almost every ramen shop in LA (yup, there's a lot) and comes across a lot of \"boring\" vegan broths. The SPICY CREAMY VEGAN RAMEN at JINYA is by far her favorite. It's really tasty and is True to its name... both spicy (but not too spicy) AND creamy. BUT DON'T GET THE VEGETABLE SOUP RAMEN. My friend said she was SUPER bummed last time she went there and they were out of the Spicy Creamy Vegan so she tried the Vegetable Soup Ramen. She said it was a bummer and bland in comparison.   I've tried the JINYA Tonkotsu Black and it was GREAT. Tasty, but not too salty. Hits the spot.  And who doesn't love a good mochi ice cream dessert to top you off ;)  Overall, I recommend this place for a quick ramen fix, especially on a cold day. Oh and try the Tokyo Curry rice... YUMMY!   Also, the construction is done so there is great parking! Convenient and easy.",

I absolutely love soft-boiled egg in my ramen, so I got extra :) the yolk was perfect. I guess this certain soup usually comes with thick noodles but they were out, so it came with thin. Very delicious and cooked perfectly! We got some gyoza and it had good flavor, they were a little smaller than I'm used to, but flavor was there so it's all good.  THE JINYA BUN. LITERALLY THE BEST THING EVER. My parents took me to this ramen bar as I was visiting and we all took a bite of our buns at the same time, let me tell you about the silence that overtook our table. THE JINYA BUN IS AMAZING, and if you haven't been blessed with being able to try it here, I'm sorry. But go do yourself a favor and go there and order some RIGHT NOW.",

Sometimes, people have a way about them and their presence is just unwelcome even if you don't know them - that was our server. She'd take our order, and then walk away without a word - didn't even look up from the tablet. No \"thank you\" or \"you're welcome\". My drink cup was empty for way longer than it should be. Not the greatest. The kicker was an interaction with the party seated behind us. They asked for something, she says \"Ohh there's only one left and I'm taking that for my boyfriend\"  LOL REALLY.

The Takoyaki was delicious and had a perfect ratio of octopus and batter. The Tonkatsu Black, presentation and ingredients-wise, reminded me of NY's Ippudo's Akamaru Modern bowl (which to this day is the best bowl of ramen I have ever had). The taste however was disappointing. I waited a minute to start eating my bowl because I was waiting for my additional topping of corn, but the broth was lukewarm and watery. I thought the garlic oil would enhance the flavor, but it really didn't make a difference. I was disappointed to say the least. Maybe it was an off day or I ordered the wrong thing? Who knows. But I will give this place another shot in the future.",

    "text": "Does Vegas need another ramen joint?  Well if the menu is different enough, why not?  I had my reservations about this place but glad I tried it anyways.   Glad I did.  The menu is less traditional than the other places in town.  I started with the karage chicken.  Flavor wise, best I've had in Vegas.   Light batter with nice seasoning and a lot of chicken flavor.   Nice to have chicken taste like chicken.  Comes with a sauce but it's great straight.   Also, had the fresh tofu, made at your table.  This was a real winner also.  Comes with 4 toppings and a ponzu sauce.  toppings were a sesame salt, green onions, scallions, bonito flakes and a citrus/ginger topping.  Any fan of tufu should like this.  The main event was the tonkatsu black for me.  Their noodles are awesome.   Al dente with a rich flavorful broth.  My friend had the the white and I also liked it. Lighter but still flavorful broth.    The wait staff was very attentive and friendly.   Only weird part was that none of the booths were open and so we had to sit at a large communal table.  Slightly awkward at first but turned out to be a fun night.  (no I didn't go into the women's bathroom).  I'll return to have some of the other offerings.",

Overall appetizers were a hit and miss.  Luckily the ramen made up for it.  And in reality it is a ramen place.    Stick to the ramen and maybe try the poke taco.",

    "text": "While I admit, I'm not a ramen expert or anything, I do enjoy getting it a couple of times a year. I let my friends pick the spot, and they suggested JINYA. It was a small restaurant, typical of ramen places, and luckily, we arrived early enough to beat the rush. We only had about a 5 min wait before we were seated.  I always check out menus online before I go, so I was sad to hear that the Old School ramen has been taken off the menu, but the online menu wasn't updated yet. In my state of confusion, I just ordered the chicken ramen and a bunch of additional items for my ramen. We also ordered a chicken katsu appetizer for the table.  The chicken katsu was delicious! Piping hot, meaty, and full of flavor. I probably could have just eaten that and been happy.   The servers deliver each add-on item separately in little bowls. I guess that's to make sure you see that you've gotten everything, but it makes for a cluttered table very quickly. They initially forgot my egg, but remedied the error before I could even say anything.  I do think I ordered the wrong thing, because while my noodles were great (and plentiful), my broth and chicken were pretty tasteless, even with butter added. Thank goodness I had so many add ons! Next time, I'll ask which broth is the creamiest.   Service was good and I think pricing was fair. And there was a huge line when we left- thank goodness we missed that!",

    "text": "Wanted to try a different ramen house than my usual spot and this was next in line to try after Monta and Sora.  Although the service was fine, I was not very impressed at all by the food.  We are all creatures of Yelp! and Instagram. So we ste all flooded by pictures of the food before dining in the establishment. I started off with their Jinya Bun, which is a pork belly bao bun. Picture wise on their menu it looked impressive, but seeing the actual product was very lackluster. Picture depicts a thick cut of said pork belly but what was presented was basically no where near in comparison. No amount of angling could make that bao bun come close to the menu picture. Taste was was nothing exciting, especially the texture. The texture of the pork belly was so tender that there was no contrast to the steamed bao bun. No crunch of any kind. Then again,  $3 is very accurate for the food, but you can be the judge for yourself when you order.   Next up is the ramen itself. I ordered their specialty of spicy chicken ramen, hot for the spice level. Noodles were al dente and that they use the skinny straight noodles which are my favorite! \"Hot\" level was that hot. More like a 3 or 4 out of 10 in spice levels. Broth was solid. But that stops there. I love my toppings and that is where I am disappointed.   The word toppings for me implies it actually goes on top of my food. Instead my three toppings of charsiu pork, bamboo shoots (really more like bamboo hearts), and onsen egg were served on individual plates instead of my ramen.....  I'm not for waste of plates and space. If my table is going to be filled with plates, it must be on actual food and not my sides haha. Another thing that irks me about this is the pork being three halves. I understand clearly it's about food cost, but can places actually serve the actual round slice of charsiu instead of halves and charge accordingly?   Overall, I'm glad I've finally been able to try Jinya, but still not in any rush to come back again.",

I'm not sure if they got new recipes or a new chef but they had new ingredients. I always get the spicy chicken ramen, today there was a huge ball of spinach in it. They didn't have the actual chicken \"crumbles\" in it. I sent it back since it was cold and they came back with one that was barely hot. I honestly won't be coming back here again.",

The only thing that won't make anyone happy here is the wait. Jinya is usually very busy after 5:30PM and sometimes the waits can be anywhere from 25 minutes to longer especially if you have a big party.  The wait is mainly because it's not a big building so that can't seat a ton of people at one time.  I'm telling you though that the wait is worth it. If you come with a large party you'll probably have to sit at the big community table but for smaller parties of 1-4 this place works out better.  My personal favorite is the: Cha cha cha  I hope you guys eat here and enjoy it as much as I do!",

Upon arrival we checked in and there was a small but quick wait (no longer than ten minutes) We were seated in one of the booths but they also have bar and table seating. The atmosphere here was a whole vibe! Cozy decor and the ramen here was so flavorful and delicious! The menu had a wide selection and was very affordable! We got the gyoza (potstickers) must try! With spicy tonkotsu ramen! You can add on extra toppings of your liking to ramen as well. The server was friendly and service was quick. This is now our new favorite place to come for some good ramen!",

Atmosphere: Not too distracting The music was a bit loud upon getting seated at our table, but it wasn't anything too detrimental to our experience. The floors and tables are clean and we were seated comfortably.  Service: Very reasonable For my party, we were given our food in a timely manner and were all served at the same time. The waitress was kind enough to lower the music for us since it was a bit too loud and was very polite upon serving us our food. All the questions we had about the menu were answered by the waiter and we were all satisfied by what we were all served.  Food: Excellent! At Jinya, you get exactly what you order. The food met all of my expectations and the presentation of the menu items was spectacular. Our food was all full of flavor and all the items we ordered stayed True to what was described by both our waiter and the menu.  Overall: Willing to return! The food was excellent, service was spot-on. I am definitely a fan of this ramen restaurant. Definitely worth the money and time. Stop by to this place if you get a chance!",

I ordered the Tonkatsu black and my boyfriend got the cha cha cha ramen and made that in a combo and got the pork chashu bowl & salad. My ramen came out to be really gooood and they even have the option to give you fresh garlic and a garlic press so you can add as much garlic as you like! My boyfriend ramen was great also but the pork chashu bowl was one of the best rice bowl I've tasted honestly!!! I like it better than my ramen. Lol the server was very nice and attentive. I would definitely come back again when I'm in the area!",

    "text": "Recommended by someone from work. Parking is extremely limited. Looks like it was an old fast food restaurant. I believe the Taco Bell next to it looked bigger.  The wait was about 5-10 minutes, not long at all, but that was because we chose to take whatever seat was available first. Little did we know the seat we took was going to be at a large communal table in the center of the restaurant. When we first walked in the table looked like it was just a large party eating together, so we had no idea that was an option.  The ramen was over priced for what it was. We've had better for cheaper.  Ordered the chicken for myself and my son, we both received two slices of chicken. Husband ordered the brothless ramen. He says the noodles were cold as if they came out of the fridge, he says there was something in it that made his mouth have a numb feeling.   The waiter was really nice, no complaints on his service, but we will not be coming here again. 3 bowls of ramen, 2 sprites, and edamame totaled $47",

Once we got our noodles ( JINYA chicken noodle, spice chicken noodle, JINYA tonkotsu black noodle). I found the noodle tasted strange, very sticky and grease, my younger son also complained and could not finish his bowl. My oldest son and I were so hungry we gobbled down food no matter the taste. Well, my oldest son threw up right after he walked outside the restaurant, my younger son threw up after we got back to hotel, and I also had the urge to throw up before bed but did not , but ended up going to bathroom diarrhea all night long. In the morning, I had to call South Nevada Health District to report possible food poison case. I am not sure how many star I should give, but I think it is more important to alert the public about this situation.",

Not only that the service is great every time I visit too! But going back to the food, the noodles are perfectly cooked. The loaded takoyakis are a mountain of flavor--Probably the best I've had in Vegas.",

The place is alot larger than most ramen restaurants and to have a line with a large area va a small area is a good thing. Ryan was our server and he was amazing. He gave 2 recommendations and I opted for the Jinya Tonkotsu Black and my wife decided on her own and got the California poke bowl. I wasn't in the mood for any appetizers but for some reason,  Ryan's charm got me with the happy hour menu and order the Salmon lover taco and pork belly taco. The mini tacos was served in a hard shell and it balanced out the crispness and soft Salmon. The pork belly mini taco was extremely flavorful and juicy. When my ramen arrived, I noticed that the noodles wernt what I was used to, but that's just the looks because the texture was a tad bit harder than the soft ones other restaurants make. I enjoyed every bit of my meal. My wife's meal was good but had better. My taste buds would appreciate more avocado and tuna. Overall the place is wonderful, very modern and not traditional at all. The lady at the podium is pretty but should smile more, its either shes sad or that's her natural rest face.",

First, there was about 7 people waiting at the door and hallway even though there were about 8 or 9 seats open and clean table with chopstick and napkin already set. The waitress doesn't start seating those open seats until she's finish talking with her friend.  Second, while waiting to be seated the kitchen staff comes out from the kitchen and start taking a dinner break and starts eating at cashier just by the entrance where customers are waiting to be seated.  Third, when I ordered KAEDAMA (extra noodle) it took about 30min even the people who ordered extra noodle after I did was getting it. I asked why and seems like there was miscommunication between the cook and waitras. The waitress comes to me after talking to the cook says to be it should be ready in couple min without any apology.  I will never go back to this place.",

She has dark hair color and she was wearing a choker the day I came. There was another hostess I believe and she was preppy and nice. But unfortunately we didn't get that kind of service from the other hostess. The server was okay. He didn't smile the first time but smiled after we ordered. Honestly the service really killed my mood. As a first timer here, I would never come back. First impression is everything.   Food: The ramen was good.

Many people like different ramen places in Las Vegas and I have 2 favorites right now and one of them is Jinya.   The food is amazing! I really like the pork bun, the crispy chicken, and the pork ear chicharron (those are just the appetizers). All of these took me by surprise because I did not think that I would actually enjoy those foods. I expecting to think eh. The crispy chicken has to be cooked in some sort of god sent seasoning and it is nice and crispy and very hot...(but super yummy). The pork bun was delicious! My cousin ordered it and we shared it but it was so flavorful and I really wanted to eat more, but it was all gone :(. BUT, we should really talk about the RAMEN! It is so good and flavorful! Some places have a more specific flavor but I think Jinya encompasses a good taste in their ramen and it makes me happy.   The staff is very nice and they give very good service. I really like them and they take really good care of you while your there. Which I realize must be super hard because this place is always busy. I feel like ramen places are always really busy and Jinya is no excuse.   The atmosphere is very bar like in my opinion. It is very dark and intimate.  I feel like a lot of restaurants are going for dim lighting and dark settings now. I don't know if I like it or not. However, I will say I love having the big table in the middle. It feels very communal. Which, Im not sure is good or bad. It just has a welcoming atmosphere for the most part. Sometimes its awkward if you sit directly by someone you don't know but most of the time people are really nice at the big table.   Overall very good experience and one of my favorite places to dine.",

It was literally the best ramen I've had. I can't wait to come back just for this.   My friend tried the Tokyo Ramen and thought the same thing about hers.   Also tried the almond pudding with the fresh fruit topping.  It was good. Nice change from the usual ice cream options at the other places.",

    "text": "I visited this place along with my job training class on October 31st. None of us decided on where to go for lunch, so we all settled on Jinya, which was conveniently located next door (not even a 5 minute walk.) We all walk in and the place is extremely lively. Delicious aromas all around and s someone who worked in the food service nearly her entire life, I usually look for flaws in eating establishments. Couldn't find one. We all sit down and only one orders an appetizer, which was Edamame. Now I'm a cultured little lady, so I usually don't branch out from my comfort zone, but since it was offered to the rest of us to share, I decided to try one.  It was pretty good. Interesting at most.  I soon found myself unconsciously nibbling at them one by one until our food came out. I had the basic chicken ramen with nothing special added. The only other time I EVER has ramen (that wasn't in cup form) was in LA at a place called Mr. Ramen. Jinya FAR surpassed that of MR. The broth has a good, heavy feel to it and not much of a watery, soupy context. It was so delicious that I was the first one to finish eating and ended up becoming actually upset that I didn't have enough money to order another bowl. This place really ended up etching a place on my heart, so the next day, I ended up eating from there again.  The next time, I had their Tokyo Rice Curry and if you like to eat like me, their lunch size, I promise is MORE than enough. I expected one tiny little bowl for $7, but you get that and SO MUCH MORE. It was delicious like nobody's business. Needless to say, I ended up taking home leftovers.  Overall, if you're a pasta lover like me and also happen to like the Japanese cuisine, Jinya is the place to go. It's not the biggest restaurant, but for its size, it was cozy, warm and their waitstaff was very friendly. Extra points for the Pokemon Go discount, where if you \"caught\" a pokemon in the restaurant, they put you in a drawing to win a free bowl. I will DEFINITELY be back soon!",

Luckily, they weren't bothering anyone but there were so many!   Soup was delicious and good price. When we left, I noticed the back door was open and that's probably where the flies were coming in. Small and great place for ramen, minus the flies!!",

They never came to check on you or ask if anything else is needed. Waited for the check and nothing. I had to get up there and ask for it. The food was decent but what ruined the whole experience is the lack of customer service and I manage a restaurant in a casino and being that this place was not busy is no excuse.

    "text": "So we came here because we have heard good things about this place.  We were able to arrive right before a huge rush and there was no wait.  The host was very unfriendly and even though there was no one in line or waiting and tables were open he still had us stand there in front of him for 10 mins before finally acknowledging us.  We were seated on a dirty table which i used my napkin to wipe off the seat.  The server was actually pretty nice.  We told him it was our first time and he seemed happy to explain the menu to us.  After we placed our orders the food came out pretty quick.  Thats where the problem started.  My order was wrong.  So i asked the server if i could send it back.  He said no problem.  When i finally got my order back it was wrong again.  I received what i ordered but now everything extra i ordered like an egg and garlic were not in the bowl.  So i had to call the server over again and ask if i could get the extras i ordered (since i was paying for them anyways) and he was annoyed now and went to the cooks to get it.  He brought back an egg but nothing else.  I didn't feel like requesting the rest of my items even though i was being charged for them.  I did ask for the server one more time which now took forever since he was avoiding me.   When he finally came back to our table i asked if we could have a spoon since we were the only table without any and we wanted it for our soup.  He said ok and walked away.  He never came back with our spoons.  We were over this place and wanted our bill which took another 20 mins for the server to come back with our bill.  I gave it a 2 star instead of 1 because the soup was pretty decent.  It would have been better to try the soup if it would have had all the extra ingredients i ordered. I think for now on i'm just going to stick to my usual place ramen sora.",

I was excited to see the presentation as shown on the menu but it came out in a ship-shaped plastic dish and the Nuri (paint) was chipped to the point they should just replace it.   Also, the rice was not Japanese rice.  I am very picky about my rice.

SERVICE  The service has always been good here. This is probably the one thing that hasn't changed.  FOOD Tonkatsu Assari: This is one of their specials and also my usual order. Since they've opened til now, I have noticed a change in the broth. About a month or so ago I noticed that the broth has looked and tasted more like MSG. My boyfriend and I liked Jinya because the broth was lighter than Monta's. A second note is that the broth also has changed in taste. I ate here last night and my broth, as well as my friend's tasted insanely sweet. Some of my noodles were also clumped together on the side and they were a little uncooked compared to the rest of my noodles. I don't know if there is a new cook or not but the ramen I crave for at Jinya just leaves me wishing I chose another place instead.  Takoyaki: Still tastes the same, but they became smaller.  Another thing that I liked about Jinya is that they are open til late. Recently however they start to run out of half of their menu items by around 9-10pm. One night I came and they were completely out of pork broth. Last night they were out of half of their ramen. I just find it strange how this use to never happen before.  Maybe it's time to go back to the old time favorite Monta?",

    "text": "I'm torn on Jinya. There are a lot of positives to it. Firstly it is open until 3:00 AM, far later than others in the city. Next, the sides are great. The gyoza, quinoa salad, chashu bowl... They all taste so good and the prices are excellent on them. Last, the service has never been bad when we've gone here. If they make mistakes, they correct them (often with a free item). The servers are all 5 stars.   However, there is one huge negative to this place. The ramen. I don't think I've had a good bowl of ramen here in the near 10 times I've been. My wife has said the broth is very slimy which she says is a indicator that the noodles are cooked along with the broth. The worst part for myself is that the flavor of the ramen have a greasiness to them. Almost like fried chicken. Especially their Tokyo Yatai. It tasted like KFC in a bowl. This flavor extends to their other ramen, like the Tonkotsu ramen. Also, the broths are very one dimensional. I feel a good broth should have a depth of flavor - a bit spicy, rich, salty, etc. But the broths at Jinya are just flat, generic tasting.   That is why for all the positives, I just can't get behind Jinya. The ramen isn't very good, actually it's below average. That's alright if it's a generic Japanese restaurant or Izakaya, but for a ramen shop that specializes in ramen, that is damning. There are so many other options in Las Vegas, that you should skip Jinya. When most of their ramen are approaching the $10 price range, I feel you should be getting a great product.",

The takoyaki was better than any I have tried before, so satisfying and mouthwatering! Their tonkotsu black ramen was delicious and full of flavor, which makes me wonder - why have I never tried garlic with ramen before? The almond tofu dessert was also a dream, although I barely had any because my date nearly devoured it whole. We also ordered a lycheetini and even that was a delicious and refreshing treat.  This place is probably my favorite in terms of Las Vegas ramen restaurants and I am eager to have many more meals here. As they say, \"No ramen, no life!\"",

I was a bit disappointed in the place because they ran out of all things chicken and I really wanted the spicy chicken noodles. Regardless, the food was still good and the staff is unbelievably friendly.  Fast forward to last Wednesday. My girlfriend and I went for a friend's birthday dinner and I finally got to order the spicy chicken ramen I wanted. IT WAS AMAZING. I'm one of those people that orders food and is full within the fist three or four bites but not this time. I ate the entire bowl and was still tempted to order more. The next day I wanted to go back. I still want to go back. The bowl was the perfect amount of spicy - I added nothing to it except fresh garlic (which is free, by the way). It's so delicious. I definitely recommend!",

I would highly recommend going during their happy hour for discounted appetizers! Their menu is a little small but everything we ordered was excellent.   They have family-style dining areas of you don't mind sitting next to strangers or you can wait a little longer for your own table.   I ordered their spicy chicken ramen... So darn good I'm drooling just thinking about it! I highly recommend their gyoza and their almond tofu desert as well!!  I'm absolutely coming here again the next time in in the area!",

I was shocked when the server brought out the same large bowl I'm used to but with a splash of soup and ramen at the bottom of the bowl! Smh I have not returned since.     Service is always very spotty and the servers seem to always put in my order late because they are more focused on the larger tables.  My other favorite spot is not too far away and always has a long wait time but I will plan ahead and just go there instead. Jinya has lost me as a customer.",

    "text": "I love ramen! I have wanted to try this place for the longest time but their hours were so late 3pm-3am. I was off yesterday, and no one wanted to go with me, so I just went by myself!   I was seated immediately as there was just a party of 1. They sat me at the bar, and took my order quickly.  The waitress asked if I had been there before and when I told her I hadn't, she explained the menu and reccommended her favorite dish which had chicken and pork broth. I love pork, so I ordered the tonkotsu assari. It came out immediately. The broth was actually a lot lighter than what I am used to.  I like my broth heavy and thick. There were plenty of veggies on top. At first I was scared that it'd be all veggies, but my noodles were hiding underneath the mountain of bean sprouts. The noodles were the only noodleson the menu that were thick. One of the reviews complain there was only 1 piece of chasu, but mine had 3 pieces.   My younger sister last minute wanted some ramen, so I order the spicy chicken ramen with a spice flavor of hot for her. That order actually took a little bit longer as it got more crowded.  Her noodles were thinner and the broth was more of a chicken flavor. I did like the spice level of her ramen broth. When I ordered the noodles for take out, they put the noodles in one container and the broth in another container. The garnishes are on top of the noodles. My sister just put the noodles in the broth, and it tasted wonderful. They do have a drive through coming soon, which is probably how they will package that. I wonder how the drive through is going to work as the noodles do take a while to cook...   Just a minor complaint. I like spicy as I am part Korea, but they didn't have any chili oil. Sadness. They did have chili powder and spicy sauce, but it just wasn't the same without my chili oil.   The service was really good, and they waitresses checked on me several times to ensure that everything was okay. It just didn't taste better than what I expected.",

The broth was very flavorful, & I loved the thin noodles, since that's what I'm used to. I didn't really care for the pork that was in it (I can be picky when it comes to meat), but it's okay since the soup & noodles filled me up. The portion was a good size, big enough for two people to share.   The service was excellent. Our waitress was always around to check on us, but wasn't too overbearing. I'll definitely be back again!",

Instead we get this girl who looks like she would rather be doing something better than serve people food. She rushed our order and our drinks, only to disappear and not come to the table to check on us. My son got his order 15 minutes before we had all of ours...it wasn't even busy! There were two other families and that's it. When I went to dig in my whole bowl was mostly cold with some luke warm broth in it. Even the meat hadn't fully heated through in the broth.

I had noticed several of my fellow Yelpers checking int to Jinya so after bookmarking it a couple of months ago decided to give them a try.  I must say I was not disappointed.  The fact they are a chain restaurant is surprising as they have the feel of a local place.      The decor is modern and inviting.  The staff was very friendly and made the evening special.  We were all in the mood for some Ramen and looking at their selection was kinda exciting. They have a pretty good selection of unique flavored Ramen so choosing one was challenging.     We started off with the Jinya Buns which were delicious.  The bun itself was very tasty and the pork inside melted in your mouth.  We also had the Jinya Dynamite which was also a special treat.  Unities in flavor and so tasty.  The heat level was very good and it was hot even to the last bite.  The Gyoza were really good but unfortunately my daughter hoarded most of them so I only got one.      The Ramen was just what we needed.  It had been some time since we had had Ramen and all 3 of us were dying to try theirs.  I had the Tokyo Tonkotsu,  my garlic loving daughter had the Cha Cha Cha (for garlic lovers) and the wife had the Tonkotsu Assari.  the noodles were perfect and the pork was tasty and plentiful.  What stood out to me was the broth.  They all three had very good broth which had a depth of flavors.   I truly enjoyed their Ramen and will definitely some back soon to enjoy it again.",

I don't know if it was taken over by a new owner or they switched out all the chefs. However it has drastically changed. The food does not taste the same. Yet its more expensive. The music is still too loud, and they really need to do something about the pile-up at the door. They need some type of paging system, some outside seating or something. It's always super congested whenever you go in there. I understand that you have to wait, but to have a pile-up of people at the door is absolutely ridiculous, not to mention confusing. I won't be back unfortunately. Its no longer worth it to me.",

And then we stood there 5 minutes in front of her with no other customers coming in or out and she calls out our name like there were a hundred people standing there waiting to be seated when we're the only two.....?

To say first I m alone , my experience is that most servers are not too thrilled about it, it took them a couple minutes to acknowledge me but then she was friendly. I got the salad that was ok nothing special. The California roll was really good , real crab and not freezing cold. The Chicharron was interesting, served on crispy kale that was very salty was the pig ear, don't really know if fried or how it really was prepared but it was flavorful and strange in a good way. The Ramen was very tasty, as for the broth the rest was nothing special kind of weird , smooth pork and the same leaves that I had in the salad? What's up with that?? Well the food was good , the service ok and the blasting music not my thing to eat a soup to.",

    "text": "Ramen restaurants have picked up in popularity over the past few years in Vegas, & I feel Jinya is the best! Their gyoza is the most delicate, soft, & gentle... There must be a secret behind it. The Jinya Bun is a must every time I go.  The flavor is always spot on, though the size of the meat has varied from time to time. If in doubt of which ramen to order and you enjoy spicy foods, definitely order the Spicy Chicken Ramen.  It is the perfect level of spiciness. It is hot enough to make you eat too much of it, but not so spicy that you can't eat it.  There's also an option to add more noodles to your bowl. The restaurant has a cool,hipster soundtrack.  I sometimes find myself downloading songs that I have heard at Jinya! If you visit the restaurant in the evening, you will likely wait for a table.  I promise it is worth the wait!    While JINYA is still my fave ramen restaurant, I must mention that their hostess needs additional training.  I believe she mentioned that her name is Melanie.  This evening, we arrived at 525pm and added our name to the list for a party of 7 and were told the wait would be 30 minutes - not a big deal.  Well, at 6 PM, the center table had 12 open seats, & we were still standing.  It felt like Melanie was dragging it out on purpose.  She would very slowly and deliberately count out 7 menus, answer a few calls, put the menus down, use the orange highlighter on the roster, answer the phone again, pick up the menus again, and recount them, all the while the 12 seats remained open for nearly 15 minutes.  Does she think she works at a nightclub on the Strip?  As we were waiting, a party of 10 came up, and she told them it would be a 2 hour wait!  It was so ridiculous.  I think someone should train this girl properly.",

So, I guess I have a certain flavor that I'm looking for.   First off the waitress was sweet as can be and very attentive. If we were ever wanting anything, I'd simply have to look up at my food and smile and she'd be there. Got to love good service. We went for a late lunch so there was no line and about 5 tables inside. Perfect time because apparently they have a waitlist at night.   The Gyoza tasted like my mom's home cooking. Yum! The fried chicken was very flavorful but a bit too chewy for my fiance's liking. They use dark meat but you can tell the fat wasn't trimmed much. The tonkotsu assari ramen had good flavor, the egg was cooked perfectly, loved the bean sprouts and I added some bamboo. The noodles were a little overcooked though and though the serving size was perfect for me because I don't eat too much, it was a smaller portion than what I would expect for ramen. If you're hungry, I'd recommend ordering extra noodles and broth.   Overall a solid 4 out of 5 stars. Now to go try the other ramen restaurants in sin city and find my favorite!",

Apps were good though. We had the cauliflower and crispy chicken. They also have a good selection of add ins however they were pretty skimpy for the prices.",

It's definitely worth visiting though and I'd rather eat here any day than pay exorbitant prices at The Strip for ramen.  My husband and I both ordered the Tonkotsu Black ramen. The broth was okay... it was a bit too salty for me, but my husband thought it was perfect. The nori was horrible! It tasted like rotting fish! It almost ruined the entire bowl.  The saving graces were the noodles and the pork chasu. Out of all the ramen places I ate in Vegas, JINYA had the best pork chashu. It had a good amount of actual MEAT as opposed to just fat on fat on fat. I also really liked the thin noodles, they weren't too heavy and still managed to have a great bite to them. The other toppings (kikurage, green onion, nori dried seaweed, seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, spicy sauce) were also great complements.  I'd definitely eat here again next time I'm in town, but I may tell them to hold the nori... literally the WORST nori I've ever had.",

    "text": "I've been to the JINYA in Houston, TX, so when I heard there was a Las Vegas location, I wanted to eat something I was familiar with from home. With that being said, chains aren't always the way to go. The consistency and quality of the Ramen broth was not there.  First off, right when we walked in, there wasn't a wait which is definitely a plus. The restaurant only had a few tables of patrons. So we were quickly seated in the corner. I noticed the table was sticky and flagged down a server to ask for napkins to wipe it down. The waitress looked at me annoyed as if I made up the story to make her like more difficult. She probably deals with tourist all the time. So I was a little empathetic. But For a half empty restaurant, customer service should be king! When she came back to take our orders she didn't even remove the dirty napkins off the table. But that's okay. I just placed it out sight in the corner.  Now to the food. I ordered the pork ramen and added some extra goodies. The food came out fairly quickly. But when I tasted my broth, it had a sour taste to it. But since the waitress already had an attitude, I decided to just add some gyoza and ponzu sauce to mask the taste. It did help with the broth. Needless to say, hours later, my stomach did not agree.  My whole experience was just not satisfactory. From the dirty table, to the unnecessary attitude, and the broth itself, I won't be returning to the Vegas location any time soon.",

The lines look long but they move quickly as the seating is pretty open and they have a big seating bar in the middle which also helps the wait times. However, I have high standards for ramen coming from Socal and Norcal.   I tried the Tonkotsu Black ramen and thought it was average. It wasn't bad, but it didn't blow my mind like some of the reviews I've read. Also, for the price, I feel like they should give more as I pretty much ate the whole bowl in a couple big slurps.   Overall, this place is good but I wouldn't queue in the long line just to get ramen.",

I dunno- it's a personal taste. The best ramens can be light with their broth, yet still taste strong.  JINYA has a thick broth and it just wasn't for me. It was just sticking to my lips a little too much and making me feel greased. I have only been there once and can only speak for the specific ramen I ordered (Tonkotsu Black), but if that's representative of their ramen, I'm not a fan.",

When I open the soup container there was not enough soup at all for extra noodles. I had to throw away the extra noodles because I had already ate the soup which was only 1/3 full of the container. What a waste of money and food.   Also, after a few hours I had eaten, I noticed myself constantly drinking water for a few hours, which means they put a lot of MSGs. I was very disappointed. However, the ramen was good but they had put so much of MSGs I had to go to bathroom so many times throughout the night. I had never experienced this at other ramen places. So bummed. :(",

    "text": "My friend was always raving about this place and I'm a HUGE sucker for Ramen. Figured we would give it a shot. My favorite ramen place by me closed down so finding a new spot is hard.  We were greeted very nicely and sat right away. We sat at the Ramen Bar. Server was polite and friendly. He sold us a drink they didn't have but was very apologetic about it. Didn't matter to us we were there for Ramen.  I was really hungry so I had the Pork Bao Buns. They weren't the best I've ever had. The pork was just TOO fatty. Flavor was still good. The mayo and the cucumbers on it paired well. Didn't know mayo would be good with Pork. They are $4 for each bun. Good pricing. (I give it a 3/5)  The seaweed salad was 2.80$ and was a massive bowl. Really healthy and great portion size. Can even eat for an appetizer or side. It is inevitable you will always have seaweed salad stuck in your teeth lol. (I give it a 5/5)  The Ramen was great. I kind of customized my own because I'm THAT guy lol. I got thin noodles, Tonkotsu broth, cabbage and 3 eggs. I love eggs in my Ramen and they cooked them perfectly, plus they were so tasty.  I suggest adding more eggs to yours because it only comes with one. (I give it a 4/5)  For 3 people. 3 apps. 3 bowls of Ramen. 3 drinks we spent $69. Great pricing for a great meal and night out. Thank you again Jinya, I shall be back!! Pricing- I give it a 5/5",

A little messy outside with some trash and graffiti around the building! Sidewalks are dirty and doors / glass were also dirty !   Surprise inside again very small but very busy ! Decor is nice other than the benches are a little sticky cause they use water to wipe down instead of pledge !   The service was great ! Everyone was very helpful and checked in on you ! Could have used more ice in my water !   The food was amazing!! We had a crispy chicken that was fried and it was incredible! The Pork Gyoza  was really yummy ! I had the Cha Cha Cha and it is awesome ! The broth is very heavy with the right amount of Ramen and Pork ! Very good Garlic taste ! My mom had a chicken ramen and had a thinner noodle and on the sweeter side ! Both were good and would definitely go back!",

Small and intimate with a community table in the middle.   Good selection of ramen and appetizers as well as a small plates. And a little happy hour.   Service was good and easy. I ordered the spicy chicken ramen with thin noodles. Added a bunch of extras like mushrooms, corn, nori, and fried onions. All $1 but totally worth it because the soup was filled with the extras I ordered. I even planned to order the extra noodles toward the end for $1.60 but I was full. The portions are big and he broth was so flavorful. I had left over for the next day.   The price came to about 20.00 each for our ramens with the extras which is a little pricey but honestly worth it to me because it was a delicious meal.",

    "text": "Was pretty excited to try this place out primarily because they have a vegan option! But I was definitely not impressed.   Now I understand that good things take time and my group didn't mind waiting. However, when we finally got to a position in line where we had a view of the restaurant, there were about a dozen seats available! Mind you we had been waiting for an hour so seeing open seats was pretty annoying. It was puzzling why an establishment wouldn't at least let their patrons have a seat and get something to drink... This especially confuses me when more and more people rolled in after us, were seated immediately and the place ensued to fill up.. oh well.  When the hostess came up and called our party's name we all smiled and nodded. The hostess looked super confused, rolled her eyes and nodded a slow demeaning \"YEESS?\".  Um, yeah? Dang I'm sorry we didn't verbalize it but you don't have to be rude.   On the plus side, our server was good and deserves a little gold star! Very attentive, knowledgeable and sweet.   The food I had was no good. My vegan ramen broth was cold and flavorless and the noodles were thick and super chewy. Not a fan. It also gave me a pretty painful stomach ache for the drive home.   My friend got this chicken appetizer that was undercooked. When he brought this issue to a waiters attention they were like \"oh they're supposed to be like that because if they cooked longer the outside would burn.\" ...Haha gross.   When we got the checks we gave 2 cards and they split it for us. The same hostess with the eye rolls came back and held the 2 CLOSED bill books up without saying a word. Like how are we supposed to know which one is which? Before we could even say anything she rolls her eyes, tosses them to the table, and mouths a long \"oookaaay\".  Why so much attitude?! And why so many eye rolls? What happened to customer service?   Sorry Jinya but I won't be a returning customer.",

Food is great staff is friendly, did I say the food is great.   Get the Goku midnight cowboy. It's soooo good.    You pretty much can't go wrong eating here. I've been to a lot and there is a lot of good ones by this one is the best.   No ramen no life is their motto and they truly live by it.   Must come here if you're in town or if you've never been before. Oh ya and don't forget the curry rice. That is also amazing.",

Didnt acknowledge us for like the 15 minutes we stood in the front waiting to be helped. There wasnt a sign or anything that says to check in on the tablet in the front, the tablet even says check in on Yelp for your next visit...so we had no idea and then after 15 min she finally acknowledges us and tells us to sign in on the tablet. She sat someone at a table down who just arrived and we still had to wait... didnt apologise for anything. Anyways, my bf and I had our first date here in 2018, we didn't come back until our 1 year bc last year we received equally as horrible service lol...i guess it was wrong to assume that the service would have improved. Last year, they sat us at a table and 30 mins passed and we had to flag them down and ask about taking our order. The waitress was like \"Oh! i thought you were helped already\" like it was funny???So, I think it's safe to say that my bf and I are gonna pretend we didnt have our first date here bc they ruined both experiences :))))",

    "text": "This review is long overdue but this is my favorite ramen bar in Vegas.  It's a bit lacking in Nevada but this place makes up for It because they sell black garlic ramen. Mmmm, my favorite.  Anyways, it's always always ALWAYS packed here.  I came during the day, late at night, and late late night and no matter what time, it's busy.  It's a good sign!  Parking could be a little tough but I've always found one near by.  It's located in a plaza so there's more parking in the other areas.    As you walk in, there's always a crowd waiting near the entrance which sucks because they're always in the way.  They need to have a waiting area tbh.  So there's a host stand right by the door and you put your name.  The times I've went, the wait is usually around 30 minutes to even an hour or two.  I don't mind.  They usually ask if you want a booth or if you don't mind, they shared table.  It's a large table where they sit everyone at.  I don't mind so I'm seated faster.    They do offer happy hour items.  I always get the chicken.  I also only order the black garlic style ramen with thin noodles.  You could always opt out for thick but It does depend on the ramen.  You could also do combos for I believe $3-$5 for curry and a salad, etc.  they also have toppings to add into your ramen for cheap!! I also like that they offer fresh garlic that you could mince into your ramen or sauce, or whatever you want.  They even offer vegetarian options!!! If you still have soup leftover, you could get a refill of noodles for $1!!!   The prices are decent and I think they are fair for the quantity and quality.  I enjoy this place a lot! I will be returning here.  If you want to try this place, I suggest getting there a bit early and distract yourself while waiting.",

I enjoyed pork in my ramen in my precious life so I'm constantly on the search for fatty, creamy, belly stretching vegan ramen. This. Is. It. I really loved their spicy creamy vegan ramen both times I came here.  This place isn't that large but they seem to make it work. There are a few bar seats, booths lining the restaurant and a community table in the center. I love that they have alcohol on the menu because who doesn't love beer and/or sake with their food? They have different items like tacos and buns on the menu that I have not tried but seem to be popular. They have a happy hour for drinks and food items.  One of the best things about this place is that they allow you to order extra noodles for your ramen for only $1-2.... so both times I finished my noodles and some of my broth, ordered extra noodles to go and had my broth packed to go as well. Second meal! I wish I lived closer to this spot. I would be here all the time!",

There are also chandeliers that hang above the big table so it makes it look cooler . They have quite a variety of ramen soups to choose from there are also vegetable ramen If you're going for the healthy soup . The crispy chicken btw is VERY good and it's Japanese styled chicken . Then there's the ramen soups , the bowls have fair portions , but the noodles were a little hard and I got the thick noodles that's why I'd give it a 4 stars instead of 5 (I hope these noodles aren't the same type they put in processed cup noodles omg ) but other than that everything is was good , the customer service was excellent ! The girls were very nice , oh and last to add the bathroom was SO COOL . Like I opened the door and the toilet seat opened on its own omg and there were settings to it !! Like the toilet seat was warmed to my liking and the toilet even flushed when I said flush !! Like what the hell how cool is that . That toilet just won me over lmao and then the Michu dessert was actually pretty good it didn't taste like perfume unlike kaya sushi omg but yeah this place deserves a four star",

    "text": "We were looking for some late night noodles and found this gem a bit off the strip. The place was hopping with good music and a great look to it. We only had a 10 minute wait but since it was 1am on a Sunday night. I imagine it's much busier at peak times. Our server was Britney and she gave us excellent recommendations especially since some menu items we were interested in weren't available which was kind of a bummer but we were happy with what we ordered. She was friendly and fun. The tempura Brussels sprouts were amazing as was the skinny noodle ramen. We also or the dynamite with shrimp scallops and mushrooms, the shrimp cheese balls, the baby leaf salad and a veggie roll. All fresh and melt in your mouth flavors.  All that along with nigori  sake and some killer beer and out bill was $66. We found out there are two more in the LA area and will be making the trip to visit those since they are closer to home.",

We went here after a long hike at Red Rock and it was perfect for an after hike meal. I had the vegetable ramen and it was loaded with kale, lettuce, cauliflower, broccoli, and of course ramen noodles. There was so much that's I couldn't even finish it even though I wanted to. The waitstaff was very friendly and great at explaining what everything was. Also very attentive and never let my water go fully empty. The decor is nice but it can get a little loud when it gets crowded just because of the open seating area but it isn't so loud that you cannot carry on a conversation within your group. I recommend this place if you love ramen.",

    "text": "I'm new to the world of ramen so I will say that my opinions are  not based on a refined or cultured palate, lol.  Went in for dinner, the hostess seated us promptly, and the servers were very quick to place our order and bring out our items. One was nice enough to ask if it was our first time there, which it was, so she explained the menu a bit. That was very nice. The actual restaurant is very clean, modern, and very pretty compared to hole in the wall places. The bathroom even has those super modern toilets that have seat warmers and the lid goes up on its' own lol! So cool!  We ordered the fried chicken and salmon roll for appetizers and the spicy chicken ramen and the wonton chicken ramen. The fried chicken was among the best I have ever had from anywhere. I highly recommend it! The salmon roll but was pretty standard to any sushi restaurant. The ramen noodles were thin, and explained in the menu, so that was a little different. I prefer the thicker cut noodles but no harm done. It said in the menu so you can't be surprised by it. My wonton soup tasted like any wontons. Enjoyable but won't send you off into another dimension, lol.   For 2 bowls and 2 appetizers,  the bill was about $36 so reasonable prices as well. I will definitely go back but I do feel like other ramen places might have more flavor. Or, again, maybe this is the correct way to make ramen? I feel bad commenting as I know nothing of the preparations of ramen...this is just my opinion. :-)  I did, however, end up getting pretty sick almost immediately while eating. I was on an empty stomach so I know it was the food there. HOWEVER I have a very sensitive stomach, especially to new foods, and the other person I went with ate everything I did and they were fine so I definitely do not blame the restaurant. I just recommend coming in with a good solid stomach lol.",

I have eaten the Cha Cha Cha which they say is for garlic lovers. It's literally TOO MUCH GARLIC & I'm an insane garlic addict lol. I have figured out that ordering Tonkotsu Spicy (if you don't like spice, maybe just the regular Tonkatsu cause it does have a nice kick to it) & adding the fresh garlic provided to you is wayyyyy better ! You can add as much garlic as you want to ensure you're main course isn't literally garlic for dinner !! Lastly, the service is always super efficient & awesome & check out their toilet, you won't be disappointed ! Hahaha Enjoy !",

But now that I'm trying to eat mostly vegan, I loooove Jinya! Before you stop reading because you're not vegan, their Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen is out of this world! I honestly like it more than the several non-vegan ramen soups I've tried here which includes chicken, pork and vegetarian based broths. My least favorite has been the vegetarian ramen, it's really heavy on the vegetables which actually takes away from the ramen. But truly, do yourself a favor and try the vegan ramen.. It's so tasty!  Also, the quinoa salad is super delicious! I got it without tomatoes (personal preference) and we ate it right up. I really recommend this, it's so good!  My boyfriend ordered the spicy chicken ramen with a poached egg, a regular for him. He was very happy with his meal. But the star here is the vegan ramen! I can't get over how good it is! Give it a try, even if you're a meat eater :)",

I decided to give JINYA a try because of all of the good reviews from friends. I came on Friday night around 8pm. There were only 4 people ahead of me on the list and I only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. The hostess was really friendly and so was our server. The restaurant itself is pretty small but they seemed to get customers in and out at a pretty quickly. Every employee was extremely attentive and made sure we were satisfied with our food.  I ordered the \"Old Skool Ramen\" and subbed the thin noodles for the thick noodles. Overall I have to say that the ramen was pretty good, but I did not think that it was as good as the ramen served at Ramen Sora. The pork chashu was kind of dry, but other than that it was good.  Even though I do prefer Ramen Sora over JINYA, I will definitely come back in the future to try some of their different ramen choices.",

Even though the room is dark and loud music is bumping i felt comfortable in here.  Lets get to the food me and the wifey had the Jinya #1 and a order of shrimp balls.  Jinya #1- (3/5) i think when it comes to ramen i have a hard time being amazed or having it make my eyes roll back on taking a bite. im used to eating alot of different asian noodle soups. it was a creamy pork broth with egg noodles topped with pork,fried garlic and a boiled egg that wasnt cooked all the way so when you crack it you get that oozing yolk. i think the egg tasted weird though but thats just me. i think it would have been better with some wontons or bbq pork but then it wouldnt be japanese.  Shrimp Ball (3/5)- I think it was like those shrimp balls you get at dim sum with the sweet mayo but it had some fried garlic on the outside so it wasnt nothing special. they garnished it with chilli peppers but its something that i probably would order again.   The service was great and they were attentive and can actually hear what youre asking for even though that music was loud. Space is very limited and after we came in there was a grip of people that came in that seemed to wait for a long time to get seated. im glad i came and got seated right away. thanks for some decent ramen unless im craving it i probably wont be back",

I ordered the Black Tonkotsu which was phenomenal while my girlfriend got the Cha Cha Cha. They did this cool thing where they actually give you the garlic cloves so you can add fresh garlic to your ramen. But sadly they served the ramen raw. The noodle was extremely firm and still hard on the inside. They apologized and gave her a fresh bowl. Though they did try to argue that since the noodle was a thicker kind it was supposed to be a bit more firm. Too bad for them my girlfriend is from Japan, so they couldn't quite one up her when it comes to ramen since well she grew up eating that stuff haha. Other than that everything else was fine.",

As a whole with everything in my JINYA Tonkotsu Black and in my boyfriend's chicken/pork ramen, I would say it was on a scale 6 out of 10. It was 12:30 and I was sad that they didn't have time the Takoyaki that I keep seeing in reviews as the best anyone has had in Vegas. I will have to come back to try that. The potstickers were okay and I wish they were crispier. It tasted like the ones I boil at home and had that same boring texture and tasted like they had a hint of soy sauce. We ordered Brussels Sprouts Tempura, and my boyfriend dislikes Brussels, but really enjoyed these because he could barely taste them. The reading on them were not too thick. The hostess was kind and on it. The table service was okay as he never came to check on us and didn't really explain a couple of the choices too well with my boyfriend (his first time having ramen). We had to flag someone else down for the bill. Great atmosphere (liked he seating situations and the music).",

I asked for mushrooms in my ramen, and it seemed like someone took a handful of cold unwashed mushrooms and threw them in my soup last minute. The salad and gyoza were decent, but nothing to rave about.   All the employees gave the impression that they didn't want to be there. Our waitress made it feel like we were bothering her by eating there. She only came by once to refill our water, and then disappeared for about 15 minutes. Quite possibly the worst server I've ever had.   The entire restaurant feels cramped. The center table makes for an incredibly awkward seating arrangement. I absolutely hated this place.",

The sauces and garnishes was just as good and I love the chunks of eggs incorporated into the Japanese mayonnaise sauce.   Tonkotsu Black Ramen: the broth was extremely thick with the thin noodles being cooked just right. The chasu was delicate and the soft boiled egg oozed as you bite into it. The overall ramen was great; however, they should really kick it up a notch with the garlic flavors which was missing in the broth considering the garlic chips and garlic oil didn't do much justice.   Service: the best service I received from Vegas overall. My waitress was super attentive and nothing but smiles throughout the evening. I made an order for ramen without green onions and before placing my order to the chef, she went back and asked to make sure that I didn't want green onions in my takoyaki as well. She went the extra mile to make sure I got my food to exactly how I liked.  Seating: compared to Monta Ramen where you're cramped into a tiny space, there was more spacious seating. Also the restaurant itself was much more cleaner and attractive.",

But for real, if you are hungry and craving soup whether it's for lunch or late night, this is the place to go. Their ramen is pretty on point and I love that every time I come here, there's a new ramen dish with a twist to it. From unique flavor of the Cilantro Ramen to the light flavor of the Chicken Ramen to the tangy Spicy Ramen, this place knows how to make every and every ramen dish delicious and well of quality. I like that they offer a lot more appetizers than most ramen places and you can even come in during happy hour for cheaper appetizers too! They have great Pork Buns and the Shrimp Balls are uniquely breaded, the only appetizer I can't ever get myself to try is the Fried Pork Ear. For drinks, they do offer Sake, Beer and Wine so it goes perfect with the food. Lastly, the look of this place is amazing and I've always wanted a reason to bring a huge group of people to fill their large table. I also love the loud edm music so it can block the noise of the customers and I can rock out to my ramen. Remember, NO RAMEN NO LIFE!",

We ordered jinya 2 spicy chicken ramen, tonkotsu assari spicy, spicy creamy shrimp tempura and Sapporo beer and a lycheetini! The chicken was very basic, probably could have made it at home not to special. The tonkotsu assari however was amazing it has thin slices of pork which seemed like they had been marinated forever, and a seasoned egg which tasted marinated as well, best egg I have ever had in my life! This soup had thick noodles which I wish I would have ordered the thin ones because it was so filling. The shrimp tempura was also very delicious it was 6.80 for 4 pieces on a bed of lettuce (lettuce seemed pointless though haha) very wet sauce and amazing spicyness. Also the beer tasted like any bud light nothing special and the lycheetini was VERY sweet I wouldn't order it again because it didn't go very well with the food I ordered, but I would have it again with a desert maybe- it has Japanese vodka, vodka and fruit.",

Customer service is also a thumbs up. Very well appreciated by the waitresses. They also do bill separation with your pals when you request for it.  Atmosphere is a plus. Might be a bit small but it's still good.",

Food:  -Ramen: 4/5 What I LOVE about this place is that you can ask for them to control the salt level. I had both the tonkotsu spicy and jinya chicken with lower salt levels and they were both flavorful and not insanely salty! woot!! FTW! -Takoyaki: 3/5 OK, a bit too salty and sweet -Pork Gyoza: 1/5 tasted like microwaved pot stickers. fail.  The ramen was very good. Not out of this world or mind-blowingly delicious, but still probably the best I've had in Vegas. The rest of the food fell pretty flat. Hey, but it's a ramen house. I'll be back for more ramen!",

The restaurant seems a bit dim, but enough lighting for you to see your food and the people around you. I enjoy the chicken ramen a lot, and the servers are very friendly.  I definitely come here often, and I recommend this place greatly however, I feel like I am shouting to the person across/next to me when I am talking to them. The music is actually louder than I thought, I didn't realize it was so loud until I was literally screaming at my friend across from me because she couldn't hear me. She even said, \"Sorry, I couldn't hear what you were saying because of the music being so loud.\" Yes, I understand when you go to dinner you normally eat your food, and not talk, but if I'm waiting for my food and not eating I'm not going to be sitting there in no engaging conversation with my friends.  Overall a really delicious place, I enjoy the toppings and the noodle types. Also, have had some of their desserts before, and the desserts are too very delicious after some warm ramen.",

I wasn't in the mood for ramen, so I ordered the rice bowl. It was exquisite. The ice tea was fresh and very yummy. The ramen came out a little later, but not too long. It was huge!! There was a lot of broth left so the waiter recommended that we got more noodles. Then we put that in a box and ordered dessert. The matcha ice cream was the most interesting on the menu. So we ordered that and it was probably on my top ten list on best ice creams I have had in a while. Overall,  it was great. Will visit again",

We had a good group so got to try quite a bit of appetizers:  Gyoza - Pretty good, it's pork and veggies and pan fried.  Not a big fan when they someone does deep fried gyoza.  Tempura Brussel Sprouts - Didn't care much for it, a lot of batter and pretty bland for my taste.  Fried Chicken - Big pieces of their version of chicken karage.  Very tasty and seasoned very well.  Fresh Tofu - This was a pleasant surprise, if you have some time and like tofu give this dish a try.  They actually make fresh tofu for you at the table.  Note, this is plain tofu and you have to add the ginger, scallions, fish flake, and soy sauce that they bring on the side.  It takes some time for it to form, if you're not sure when it's ready they should be able to tell you.  Black Ramen - The soup base was pretty good, not a fan of the thin noodles though.  Spicy Chicken Ramen - This was really good and I asked for the thick noodles instead of the thin.  The noodles were chewy and the soup base was yummy.  The service was good.  It does get really busy here, so plan to wait a bit and make sure your whole party is here or they won't seat you.",

Ordering tea came in a very tiny cup with hot water only filled halfway which they never came back to refill on. It was hard enjoying my soup with almost nothing to drink down with. At this point we didn't even want to bug the server anymore and decided to leave to go get tea elsewhere. She never came to check up on us to see if we needed anything. Everything, we had to ask for.

The place isn't huge so do expect to wait a bit, especially if you're Asian and it's late at night because every other Asian is trying to do the same thing as you.  I personally like garlicky things, so I do recommend the Cha Cha one. I also personally think this branch looks cooler than the one in Los Angeles (if anyone cares about that).",

    "text": "Before JINYA, I had tried one packet of Top Ramen in college, was disgusted and never considered it an option again. All that changed after one of my bestest friend's birthday. She stated she wanted Ramen and I told her about college and she exclaimed, \"that's not REAL ramen!\" I agreed, since when was accepting a 10 cent package as the be-all, end-all of ramen? It wasn't. I was so ignorant, given my love for virtually all Asian fare (expect Korean).   JINYA has a sleek modern feel. A large table in the center is used for large parties or several small partied. It should be noted the rest of the establishment has maybe 4 seats at the bar, and the rest are booths that seat 4 comfortably. Not a place for large groups.  On my last trip I got a the Cha Cha Cha (my favorite to date!),a chicken ramen with seasoned egg, tons of herbs, and tons of garlic as well a side of fresh garlic and a garlic press. I dream about this dish. I've brought friends to taste their noodle delights and they too are hooker. I am so afraid to try Ramen elsewhere because JINYA serves up a bowl of heaven. I rarely get sick and pho is my GO-TO, but I rue the day I get down with the sickness and destroy a bowl of broth and noodly goodness. Seriously, it's next level.  I usually order a combo with a salad and/or gyoza/california roll). The salad is great and I whatever dressing they use on it, is flavorful and unlike anything I've tasted before. During a happy hour I tried a JINYA bun which was delicious (and almost as good as Fat Choy's). Oh, yes, folks, you read that correctly, JINYA has a dope happy hour (3 PM - 5PM)! Cheap drinks and all apps are reduced (although the price point here in on point).   Service is always polite and the staff seem to work in teams running food and providing refills. This place gets packed! I've seen wait times. The joint is open until 3 AM, 7 days a week! Note to self: on the off chance you get schwasted, noodle it up!  I am in SLURPY, NOODLY heaven when at JINYA, my only complaint is that the music is so damn loud in there. I've found this to be a trend in modern Asian joints. Anyone else notice this?",

Everyone was feeling ramen and soup and we came to the right place. This stuff HIT THE SPOT! It was kind of late so my girlfriend and I shared one bowl of ramen so that we wouldn't feel stuffed going to bed. (WRONG CHOICE) We were all having a good time and then I realized my girlfriend was NOT happy. (WHY?) I ate the noodles and soup so fast cause I was so hungry that she barely had any to eat! LOL.   Eggs / Broth are the best parts of the ramen here. Many would eat the noodles and stop and leave a lot of the soup left. No one here leaves the soup... It is quality soup.   Honestly, there isn't much to say other than this was a great Ramen Bar and they had some nice dumplings here as well. I can't complain for a ramen shop that is open pretty late and it served its purpose in my life.",

This is defiantly a late night spot.  When you walk in you place your name on the waiting list and wait to be seated.  Their seating options are individual booths, a seat at the bar, a seat at the community table or a small booth.  Just be sure that you are open to any type of seating.    During my visit, I ordered the Spicy Ramen Chicken, but they were out of Chicken so I had them add Pork to my bowl (which I was super nervous about).  I also added Corn and Green Onions to my bowl.  For additional charges you can add additional noodles, broth, spices, vegetables, etc to your bowl.  We also ordered the crispy chicken as an appetizer.  The appetizer came out super fast and was so good.  The chicken was cooked perfectly.  It was hot, it contained all of it's juices and a crisp outer shell.  The Rame came out in a huge bowl (which I couldn't finish and ended up taking half home with me).  The service was fast and the food was super flavorful and hot.",

It had a great consistency which not only could you taste but could also observe if you let sit too long and cool, it would start to congeal. A good sign in my opinion. The jinya bun was also great. I dont think the kewpie Mayo is necessary when the chashu is so good by itself. The piece of pork would melt in your mouth when you bit into it, both in the Jinya bun and the ramen. Excellent! The crushed garlic was a nice free addition which I welcomed. The noodles were were good but I would probably try the thick ones to compare to make a better judgement.  Price: a tad on the pricey side, but it is good ramen.  Seating: small restuarant, and be prepared to wait .  Service: Great!",

I was told to add egg in it by the server. (I'm not vegan but I enjoy eating things with no meat or dairy sometimes) the Ramen came out fairly quickly, no complaints about that whatsoever. When it came out the noodles were delicious and hot along with the broth. However, the egg was cold, and as was the Tofu. I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to be but I personally prefer all my food to be hot when it gets to the table.   Other than that, the flavor was nice and the noodles were amazing.

    "text": "Oops, this one slip through the crack among the reviews.  I suppose you have say the word JINYA with a yelling voice since it is all capitalized?  During our quest to hunt down ramen in Vegas, we found JINYA in strip mall on Flamingo Rd, which was a little different since I was once told all the ramen places are on Spring Mtn Rd in Vegas.  It was not too busy when we went in the afternoon, and the place was quite big.  We started with some Fresh Tofu and it took a while to prepare, but it was totally worth it, since it came out quite awesome from tofu liquid and turned into solid within seconds, and you can customize the flavor you want with different amount of toppings and sauce.  The Dynamite was ok, a little too heavy on the Americanized flavors for my taste.  The Jinya Black Ramen was surprisingly delicious, it had a nice balance with the broth, meat was tender, noodles were cooked al dente, and egg was perfect soft boiled, not quite an onsen tamago.  We ended our meal with some Green Tea Mochis that were just regular mocha, and the Tofu Almond Dessert, which was very nice and refreshing.  I am surprised to found out this to be a chain later, and they definitely kept up the quality at this location.  The menu was big enough for me to return here again in the future.  The staffs were also friendly as well, not the same typical Asian restaurant service you would get.",

Today i realize they changed the menu again and even raised the price AGAIN!! They changed the menu so many times in the past to let people think they add new stuffs but actually they were just raising the price! And the portion keep getting smaller and smaller! The meat comes with super mini size and the ramen portion were too small. Me and my boyfriend were so mad because we waited 30minutes for slow service +worst food +overprise!!I gave this place chances but they just keep getting worst! Wont come here again and i will rather go buy a takoyaki machine on amazon because their sauce is easy to copy lol",

Service was slow, and there were quite a few empty  tables around, but they still took a while to seat us. They might want to work a better system.  The ramen was average. Being from LA, we're used to having really good ramen. I ordered the tonkatsu white and my wife ordered the Cha Cha ramen.  The tonkatsu white had fried onions. the broth was decent, but just felt it had something missing. The cha cha ramen was garlic flavored and more memorable taste. moderately priced. probably worth the trip  place if your craving ramen somewhere off strip.",

My favorite ramen in town is still Monta Ramen, but if you want variety, JINYA is the place to be! They have a great spicy chicken ramen for those of you who don't eat pork :).  Overall, the broth is very good (personally I prefer the tonkatsu broth at monta, bc it has more flavor), and they have a larger selection of toppings and add-ons. I love the fried garlic :P  They also have a choice between thick and thin noodles (thick is definitely the way to go....)  The decor here is modern and hip. Service is great and there is a nice big communal table in the center of the restaurant that's nice for a larger party.  Overall, I would definitely come back for more ramen.....esp if I'm looking for something not pork based.",

The last time I had their ramen, I didn't enjoy it at all. The broth was fine, but the noodles were hard, the egg was cold... It wasn't so crowded before, but it's getting more and more crowded. The lychee sake is the best. The music is too loud for my taste. During the meal, I either just stay silent because it's too loud and I'm tired of talking over the music, or I have to yell at my friends so they can hear me. I don't like some tables because they're so close to each other. I don't want them to hear our talk, and I don't want to hear what they're talking about either. Now I only go back to Monta if I want ramen, even if their seats are literally next to each other, but good ramen and better price made up for it. Their restrooms are pretty nice though, I was super impressed lol but I'm not going there for their restrooms.",

They also discontinued the gluten free ramen (which was the main reason I even came here) even though it was on several places in their menu and website. Ramen was not very authentic. I was disappointed having tried many ramen joints in North America and Japan. Price is great which is why I gave one star. If you are thinking of going somewhere else, definitely do that.",

There were some items on the menu that were a bit questionable before but now I find myself here quite often ordering those exact same items. Also, just like any typical ramen shop, it's a bit tiny so always be prepared for a 15-25min wait depending on the time of day you go.  They have quite the variety of ramen and rice bowls. The Tonkotsu Black and Cha Cha Cha ramen bowls are definitely great if you're a garlic lover. I usually ask for a side of fresh garlic so I can garlic press straight into my soup until my heart is content. Plus you can get a noodle refill for only $1.60 if all you're left with is broth.  I always stop by for their Happy Hour that runs daily from 3pm-5pm and 10pm-12am. They have the most amazing Salmon Poke tacos. I don't know what sauce they use to marinate with, but seriously, those tacos are godly. They are not stingy with the amount of salmon that goes into the two tacos either and it's only $3! I also always get the Jinya Bun, which includes a nice buttery slice of pork belly.  WIth Jinya's late hours and amazing music playlists, I will continue to find myself here and will hopefully try out some more dishes.",

Portions for the ramen are good as well! The bowls are huge! The service was great. They also have a great happy hour i want to check out as well.",

We got there when tables were fully booked so my friend and I had to sit in the middle big table. Although we were given the option to wait longer for a two seat table, we were absolutely too hungry to wait any longer so the bigger table was the only option. Wasn't exactly a seating I could fully enjoy sitting with strangers, but hey it was an experience lol.   My friend and I ordered Ramen, mine was the Wonton Ramen and a side each of pork belly bao. Not bad at all! The bao had a little too much mayo though, other than that it was a good bao. Great amount for the ramen, you will not leave there hungry I can tell you that. Very filling and rich broth.  The ramen is all up to you and what you like to add on to it. It can be as ordinary as mine or some more extravagant with the add-ons. You have a few choices on the add-ons. The service was good and they were all so kind.   Anyway Im not a huge ramen fan so my review may not be that helpful to some. However my experience with the food and service was good stuff.",

All ramen, meat, vegetarian, or vegan, are all delicious in my opinion. If I was vegetarian and crave more flavor I would lean more towards the vegan creamy ramen. Other recommendations I tend to go back to is the tonkotsu black. You can adjust the spiciness level which is great and the employees are quite welcoming and nice there! I love the atmosphere, yet it can get very dense with long wait times around dinner time.",

Staff was nice and it wasn't even that long of a wait on a Saturday night, but probably won't go here again as other Jinya's have tasted much better than compared to this one.",

The music playing pumped me to buy a damn ramen bowl and made waiting not entirely terrible. The hallway to the restrooms turned into the standing line as you waited for your name to be called. Not the most glamorous of queues, but it's better than the frigid outdoors. After being called and getting seated, we were greeted by a fantastic waiter. He not only was patient, but grabbed our drinks and appetizers in a speedy fashion.   Speaking of drinks....the water!!! SMOOTH AF.  Don't think I've ever commented on the texture of H20, but there it is. Feels filtered, but so close to bottled Fuji.   Back to food. We ordered the Poke taco, Jinya bun, Old Skool Ramen, ChaCha, Pork Chashu, Salad, and green tea mochi to finish. I was glad I didn't get the chacha even though I love garlic. I couldn't get into the fish broth.   The tonkatsu black was the perfect combination of what I was looking for and had just enough broth and noodles in it, along with the soft boiled egg. It was nom!",

Two seconds after being seated, the host comes up and tells us we have to get up because they forgot someone ahead of us requested a booth. No problem, we understand mistakes happen. The host then offered us the booth next to it to be cleared off and we can be seated there. After waiting for a little longer, another host told us that booth is reserved and we could only be sat at the community table. A little annoyed my friend and I sat at the community table only to have the same booth stay open.

Another thing I noticed is that the seats are all sticky. When I sit up from a leaning position, i feel my hair sticking to the back of my seat. My pants were sticking to the chairs as well.

Let's just say I left super disappointed in the quality of food and service. You're better off at Manta. And no, this place does not at all compare to Ramen in LA.  Ordered the black garlic oil ramen combo with the curry bowl/ salad. For my ramen, I added corn and asked for spicy.  When they brought out my curry bowl, they forgot my salad. When I asked for it, they questioned if I even ordered the combo. Then came my ramen, and yet again They forgot something-  the spicy sauce. As I started eating, I fished around my bowl and noticed they ALSO FORGOT MY CHASHU. Told the server, and he said he was goin to bring me it. I waited 15 mins and my ramen got cold. Got the servers attention again and guess what- he forgot about getting my chashu pork.   So after all this, I was pretty over it. My meal was incomplete and cold. Staff are incompetent and can't seem to get an order right. They did offer to reheat my ramen-  but it really didn't live up to the hype. Don't waste your time and stomach here.",

Simply because of the not hot broth and I have nothing on the menu drawing my attention.   However, the brussel sprout tempura is fairly good and the takoyaki. But, I'm not coming for appetizers haha.",

Guys, there's happy hour and the appetizers are a little more than $3!!!! I order the chicken, and also the shrimp balls! Both amazing. Shrimp balls are normal priced although the chicken appetizer is on the happy hour menu.  I like how intimate he dining experience is. It's a small establishment with dim lighting and lots of chatter from people laughing, cooks clanking hardware, and music blazing from the ceiling above. The atmosphere is great!  I don't like how limited the menu is and all the extra charges. I wish there was a Parmesan bacon item added to the menu, or something acquired to different tastes and not just one tasting pallet. I also don't like that each time I've visited Jinya, the items I ordered were not available. It seems there's a shortage in supply. I order something different every time and both times the items weren't there so I had to order a different item I didn't desire that night.",

Let me break it down   Service: the woman who seated us was nice but seemed sooooo off, almost high? Maybe she has a super chill personality but she responded \"uhhhhh\" to my questions so that rubbed me the wrong way, but overall she wasn't terrible, just odd.  Food: I ordered the white tonkatsu and made it mild. I added bok Choy and dried seaweed. Also lemon, which the server was kind enough to bring me plenty of. The ramen was AMAZING. The broth was tasty, not too salty, not too greasy. Perfect! The pork in it was tender and the egg...OMG sooo good. We also ordered the pork chashu bowl to taste. Really good as well! Seasoned to perfection and the rice had a good flavor as well.   My boyfriend ordered the spicy chicken Ramen, I tasted a bit and loved it, it is on the spicy side though.   We drank a sculpin to wash it all down.   Great experience and will definitely be coming back whenever we come to Vegas to get away.",

    "text": "This place was good, but didn't satisfy my ramen craving. The broth was super thick. It was more of a slow cooker stew. I asked for the spiciest chicken ramen and it definitely could have used a better kick. Real spicy ramen for me at least makes me break into a little sweat but this one did nothing.   Now, I'm giving it 4 stars because it was tasty, it just wasn't traditional or what I preferred when it comes to ramen. I ordered the gyoza too which was also delicious and it came with a salad. The dressing was definitely an acquired taste. I loved it but I don't think it's for everyone.   I went during happy hour which surprisingly was from 10pm to 12am on a Sunday. Half price on beer and wine and most of the appetizers. Plus they're open til 3am which is fucking awesome cuz I'm a night owl and it's Vegas so why not?! We got there at the perfect time. No wait. When I left the wait line was well out the door. Call ahead to try and avoid huge delays in seating.   I also tried the shrimp balls which were super good. I've never had anything like those before. They were deep fried, crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious in the inside. I ordered a bun and they forgot to bring it out. I had to remind them about it right in the end and I couldn't really eat it cuz I was full from all the ramen, so that sucked.   Oh they don't carry Asahi in a bottle or on draft, which is my favorite beer, so I substituted with Sapporo on draft and it was just ok. I don't hate Sapporo but I always pair my ramen with Asahi.",

I went with a group of 7 for a work lunch right at noon and the service was quick and correct! I ordered the spicy chicken and added a poached egg and was not at all disappointed. I had to ask the server what Tokyo Negri was (listed with the ingredients) and I learned a new fact of the day - Tokyo Negri is a Japanese onion. You can order the ramen as mild, spicy, or HOT. Spicy was pretty darn spicy, so I can only imagine that hot was high up on the spicy scale.  Our table was in and out of there in about 45 minutes tops and all of us thought our food was delicious. I will definitely add this restaurant into the lunch rotation going forward.",

The texture and taste were completely off. The ramen was tasty. Not the best I've ever had, but decent. The spice levels were good and not overly salty like others I've had.   The noise level was a little high in the restaurant. I like having music accompanying my meals, but it was overwhelming and hard to hear.  Service was very friendly and efficient.

I was trying very hard not to skip or run but that's how excited I was.  I got inside and locked the door behind me and approached the glorious throne and to my surprise the lid flung open and lights and water mists beckoned me to come and sit.  I popped a squat and heard a chorus of angels as the toasty sensation enveloped my buns.     Went on Saturday 4-23-16 at 12PM for lunch.  $35.37 got us two bowls of ramen, a salad, two drinks, and a brussel sprout appetizer.   I got the tonkotsu assari ramen for $8.80 and added corn for an additional dollar.  The broth was perfect and I love the tiny bit of spice they put on the top.  I wish there was one more piece of chasu because the piece that was in there was wonderful.  My only issue (and this may be a personal preference) was that the egg was refrigerator-cold on the inside.  When the tamago is hot on the outside and cold on the inside it is so gross to me.    The baby leaf salad was a steal for $3.80 and covered in the most delicious garlicky dressing.  The fried brussel sprouts were wonderful, too! I was able to snag a wonton from my dining partner's ramen and it was marvelous.   Come for the fancy potty, stay for the tasty ramen.",

I've brought many people for their first times and all enjoy themselves.   The wait can get pretty long, about 5-20 minutes is standard these days but worth it. They still have you sign a piece a paper to put yourself on a list, sometimes they say hello but overall they welcoming should be improved. The girls doing the seating are great but just overworked and it could be much better.   The noodles dishes are so good. The sprouting up ramen is my favorite. It was a seasonal one but it was so darn popular they remade the menu and added it on the very top, I get this almost every time and add pork sabaro and corn.   If you eat all the noodles and have broth you can pay to add more noodles and even get them to go. Add the seasonings they have on the table and be sure to get the fresh crushed garlic for free, I love crushing it into my noodles.   The cauliflower appetizer is great. Dessert has changed over the years but is always good and not to heavy or big.   Price are just right but wish they had a stamp card for locals to show some love to their repeat customers.   The staff all works hard and is great overall. It gets busy but most of the time they do very good.   It is a cool vibe in this place, I highly recommend going with friends, a date, or even by yourself as they got a great little bar to sit one or a huge table to seat a large group.   Thanks JINYA Ramen Bar!",

I wish it was a little larger, as it is a popular spot, but it is worth the wait for a table. I also tend to ask for a lot of customization with my meal and they always get it right. They even have a vegan option and they are really accommodating in adjusting things to your taste.  Especially good service from Alisha and Tau.",

I ordered the Shoyu ramen with extra Brussel sprouts. I quite enjoy the char of their brussel sprouts. This place so far, is the only one that offers Brussel sprouts as an addition to your ramen. The broth of the ramen wasn't to thick and had all of the umami flavors that I was expecting.    Their chicken bun is a highly recommended appetizer.   And for dessert, I ordered their block berry icecream bar. It's pretty sweet so find a partner to share it with.   I would come here again.",

    "text": "One of the best ramen bars in Vegas! I've recently stopped eating pork and it was so hard for me to say goodbye to my favorite ramen place: Ramen Sora (since their broth is pork based) but I absolutely LOVE how Jinya also has chicken and both vegan and veggie broth selections! Now I can still get my ramen fix, woohoo!   Their salmon poke tacos are the best, which is a must try especially if you go during their Happy Hour. The ambience feels very modern and doesn't feel like a traditional ramen place - they have one huge table in the middle that can seat large groups or different parties at one time as well as booths and a seating bar that leaves a lot of space for people to sit at (versus other small ramen shops).   My bf & I usually order their chicken ramen bowl with thick noodles instead of thin and today we tried their spicy creamy vegan ramen and OH MAN, that is our new favorite!!   Definitely go here if you're looking for some good ramen especially late at night since they close at 3am which is another huge plus!",

    "text": "JAPANESE FOOD PORN (Warning: Young adults from Central Florida in for vacation) Besides offering us some of the best tasting cuisine during our visit- awesome prices as well- the large soups delivered are also visually delicious. No add-ins needed. This visual presentation had a drawback- our Takoyaki arrived doused in sauces and flakes. Visually very appealing however I don't like my dishes drowning and overwhelmed in sauce.  DELICIOUS AND COMFORTING RAMEN Oh how complicated yet delicious my Jinya Tonkotsu Black was! It wasn't too oily or salty. Splashes of boiling garlic oil and dabs of hot sauce allowed for various flavors to suddenly creep up in the middle of eating. The Cha Cha Cha was very garlicky but still approachable. Both contained generous amounts of soft pork, crunchy vegetables, seasoned & soft egg. All the toppings made every bite slightly different.   WELCOMING AND CASUAL RESTAURANT Two large tables at the center allow for big groups and community-style seating (although there's also other areas for 6-tops.) Other seats allow a great view into the kitchen. It doesn't seem very large inside- perhaps because every seat was taken during our Friday lunch- yet the look was comfy because of all the wood decor mixed in with black and red colors.",

Dinner is a ridiculous amount of people.   The first time I went I ordered the shoyu ramen and gyoza. I also got a sesame seed panna cotta that they no longer offer which is sad cause that was the only memorable thing. The ramen was ok, it was light and the noodles were chewy but nothing spectacular. The service was great though and the staff was very nice.  The time I went for dinner, the place was starting to get busy, luckily I kind of beat the crowd. The lady at the door took our names down without a greeting or a smile or any eye contact. The vibe is dim lighting and music is like I'm in a club which is cool but then it was a little too heavy on the edm which started to give me a headache. Our server was very nice and this time I got the miso. Once again, ok flavor but it was cold! Granted I was sitting under the ac vent and I was freezing my butt off so I think that may have something to do with it. The sad thing is my friend and husband got extra noodles so it got cold on the table and when they added it to the cold broth, it was just not ok.   Note to restaurant: majority of the ramen joints that offer extra noodles bring it out a little later so the noodles don't get cold, hard and stuck together while your finishing the bowl. They even offer more broth in a tea pot just to go the extra mile.",

Sora is not too far behind and Monta is always a all-time favorite.   Can't go wrong with any of these 3 ramen spots IMO.   I had their Tonkatsu Black, added corn and butter. It was a nice change of taste. Ramen noodles, perfect texture, broth on point and enough spice to enjoy. Also tried their pork belly bun and that was also pretty damn good too. Their Crispy Chicken was also flavorful and not dry.  They have unique seating and can get crowded during peak hours.   Overall a good experience. Highly recommend and will be back!",

(Jinya chicken ramen and the spouts ramen)   So our appetizers came out 5 minutes after ordering we thought cool it's pretty fast. We finished our appetizers and waited for our bowls.   We sat there talking and waiting... it was 3:30pm, we looked around and everyone after us was getting their bowls of ramen. Around 3:45pm we asked our waitress about the order, we watched her go to the cooks and of course the confused faces which made us aware that they forgot our order. The waitress came back and said it will take 5-10 more minutes. Now normally my wife and I will wait for the food because we loved Jinya so much but I had to be at work by 4:30, I didn't want to rush and eat my food and rush to work. We were also irritated how long it took. We told the waitress to cancel our order and that we will pay for the appetizers. The gentleman who was going to ring us up said not to worry about the bill which was very nice of him.   I'm not sure what happened to this place, but this was our go to for ramen. They got rid of the kale lollipop which of course we came for and was not on the menu. It was disappointing, and the experience was different. Hopefully they figure it out.",

They get busy at certain hours and can sometimes be a lil slow to get around the packed room, but always gracious and nice.  The ramen has been more consistent too! I will say... I did ask and heard that their main chef had been out of state training a new staff. Since he's been back, I feel like it's been better. Maybe just coincidence or maybe the reason, but either way, I'll take it!  Raising my 3/5 to 5/5.    Old review: Ok... so I really really want to give this 5 stars and when the new location opens (closer to me) I will still go and hope that maybe this review may help the situation.  I have been to Jinya 4 times now and I first want to say that: everything I've eaten has tasted amazing!!!! Just on taste, I would give it 5 stars. BUT I have ordered the same thing 4 times, and it has never once looked the same or had the same ingredients in it. There has been NO consistency at all. Every time, it has tasted great, but never been the same. This isn't really ok. Some times I've tried to add things that i was told was already in it, then the next time, those same things weren't in it. One time it was pretty spicy, one time, not spicy at all, twice it was mild. At this point, I'm not really sure how it's supposed to taste or what is actually supposed to be in it.  Also, the service is hit or miss. Some servers are great, others are impersonal, on one occasion, I got to listen to them bitch about each other the whole time.  Overall, I will be back. I will keep trying bc the food is good. I hope that maybe with opening a new spot and going through an entire new staff training, the inconsistency that I've experienced will not be an issue. The food is great and they offer vegetarian and vegan options, which is also awesome! I hope to update my review with a 5 st",

    "text": "This place has very good ramen if you have the cravings for ramen. I ordered the tonkotsu black ramen and it was very rich in flavor and the noodles were cooked perfectly! Although I wish the broth came out hotter in temperature because after a few mins of eating the soup cooled down.  Also don't waste your money in ordering extra thick noodles because there really wasn't a difference in my opinion in thick vs extra thick noodles    Their happy hour menu looked good and I would definitely want to come back for it especially to try their baos. The service here was great our waitress was very attentive and friendly!",

    "text": "I probably shouldn't go looking for a restaurant when I am hungry but I did.  I was meet with a long line of people that extended out of restaurant.  I was about 10th on the waitlist but only single person party.  The restaurant does not have enough waiting area for people on the wait list and they will skip you if they call your name 3 times and no reply.  This restaurants looks like a normal Japanese Ramen place but there are few quirky things about this place.  One is that there is only a small ramen bar area big enough for 5 people (usually reserved for single patrons in most places but not here).  The menu looked decent enough and food looked good and had recommendations for people new to Ramen.  I ordered the number 1 most popular ramen (for garlic lovers) and a gyoza/salad set.  After I ordered, I looked at the condiments and found a ramen seasoning that looked like Guam Finadene sauce.  I asked the waitress what is was and she said that it was Guam Sauce.  I thought this was weird and also thought that it was weird when they brought out a garlic press with garlic out so I could press as much garlic as I wanted into the ramen.  I figured it was safer if the customer added their own garlic so they can't be blamed for too much inside.  I love garlic so I added a lot.  The ramen was ok, kind of small and the garlic did add good flavor to the soup but the thick noodles were nothing special to me.  Also the gyoza was completely crap.  It was tiny and overcooked to a crisp.  The waitress forgot my salad and then brought me salad with goma (sesame) dressing which was good if it wasn't drowning in dressing.  Waitresses were cute but this place is not worth the wait if you have to wait and it is nothing special if you have eaten good ramen before.  Also don't waste time with the gyoza because mine sucked.",

We ordered a kids meal for my little one, who never received his order :( I ended up sharing my ton katsu black ramen with him. The ton katsu black was flavorful as well as the fried chicken.

Since they have only 1 vegetarian/vegan option, I had to order their vegetable ramen. It was pretty good, the noodle was too thin and tasted more like somen noodle though. I found it interesting that they put salad vegetables on the ramen so I felt like eating ramen and salad at the same time. lol  Actually I liked their takoyaki more than the ramen. It was definitely one of the best takoyaki I have ever tried in my life. Outside was so crispy but inside was chewy... Yum!  The service was good too. They came to bring water every 10 minutes.   BTW I was surprised when I saw the counter for the drive through outside. It was closed though",

Im a big fan of tonkotsu ramen and their JINYA tonkotsu black is very good. The only thing I didnt like was that their chashu was a little too brittle. I understand they want it to be tender, but theres a difference from fall of the bone tender and brittle like crumbs. The flavor was very good and the egg was soft boiled just right.  Also had their chashu bowl, but it suffered from having the same brittle chashu from the ramen. You may like it, but I prefer the chashu bowls from places like Shin Sen Gumi, Santouka or Fujin.  Their takoyaki was also very good. It was served on some sort of egg sauce. Probably shouldnt have ordered it as we already had way too much food.  I think the only 2 things I didnt like was the chashu and that I felt the price was like $1 higher for everything then it should have been. Would definitely come back.",

They have a really big communal table in the center of the place that I believe was available, but never offered, so we ended up waiting for a booth. One of the first things I noticed was that they have their \"B\" health department rating covered up by a potted plant. Service was pretty good and I enjoyed the ambiance of the place. The ramen broth was well balanced, but I agree with a previous review that the noodles are just too damn starchy. A few pieces of very fatty chashu and a whole bowl of starch. I don't think I ate even have of my Cha Cha Cha and my companion didn't finish hers either. The happy hour salmon and chashu tacos were tiny but pretty tasty. They do have a good beer selection! I'd like to give them at least a 3 star, but if a ramen place has bad ramen, you get a 2. I wouldn't repeat.",

Their flavors are a bit unusual and they offer a wide selection of optional toppings.  The location is more convenient to me than most other ramen joints.  The customer service was fine.  They are a little expensive considering the bowl leans small (they look big, but the ceramic material is just really thick and tall), and the toppings are a little stingy in portion (probably because the bowl is small).  Ramen prices in Vegas seem to be creeping up in general.  It was also odd that the \"thick\" noodle ramen (what I would call normal) in my husband's bowl was super small portion, while my thin noodles (the thinnest I've ever seen in ramen) were pretty generous.  I ordered tofu as a topping and it was cold, not cooked, and cooled down the ramen faster.  But it was an entire brick worth of tofu.  The fried onions are quite tasty and I enjoyed the chicken char-siu, still kinda rare.  The spicy is really not spicy (like maybe 1.5 on a scale of 5) - it did make the ramen more flavorful but also more salty, I think.  JINYA ramen was definitely saltier than average.  I think I'll try the basic chicken ramen next time and see if it's less salty.  This was enough to make me feel a bit sick soon after.",

The prices weren't bad, either. And the hours were great, as we had just gotten out of a show & few places are open, nevermind with vegan options. The service was good. I really appreciated that the server knew which condiments were vegan & offered that info without us even asking.  My only only oooonly wish was that we could try more of the fried veggie appetizers due to the shared equipment thing (not vegan friendly - but I appreciate how open they are about this - it's on the menu, I think).

    "text": "Jinya is the more American approach to ramen in the sense that there's room for alot of customization as well as various appetizers and sides that can accompany these dishes. The fact that this place is open until 3 lends itself to becoming the go to place for locals in the industry. The vibe is always a modern sexy type of feel with the rustic interior design, open ceilings, and dim lights lit by tastefully designed gastropub esque lighting.   Service: This place gets very busy and there's usually lines out the door at times and sometimes it's faster to eat at the spot then getting it togo as togos can take up to 2 hours or more sometimes. With all that in mind the service could still be better as once they take your order you'd be hard pressed to find them again so you have to make sure you get everything you want in. They tend to forget alot of things sometimes as well which is annoying as you have to flag them down in a sea of people at times while your food gets cold. But the servers are all friendly and nice but the execution is like I said hit or miss.   Food: There's alot going on in the menu and sometimes it feels like it's too much. There's alot of gimmicky food items on the menu but the main dishes are all on point.   Appetizers: The takoyaki is one of my favorite dishes and we always make sure to order it. The ratio is perfect and the way it's fried and drizzled in the sauce as well as topped with plentiful amounts of nori/onions is enough to get the mouth watering. I don't really bother with any other appetizer, but I have tried the Jinya bun which is good but a little pricey for what it is.   Ramen: The ramen served here is creative yet sometimes to a fault. There's certain ones that offer alot of toppings and stuff but when eating you realize you didn't even need or necessary enjoy the toppings with your ramen. We like to keep it simple with the usuals being the Tonkatsu white and Spicy Chicken Ramen. The broth here is more heavy and definitely more oily but still delicious as sometimes one craves a more intense flavor profile. Adding the fresh garlic makes the ramen 10x better (beware of smelly breath after). The noodles are more darker and is definitely better when stirred in with the broth. Egg and Chashu is the usual affair where it's very soft and melts right in your mouth. Kaedama is always good and they let you swamp the noodle types which is nice if you ever feel like switching it up.  Jinya is definitely a great spot to take a friend who's never had Ramen as there's such a variety and customization option that they're sure to find something they like. The modern interior is also very cool and is definitely a unique place to slurp ramen in. Jinya has become a staple in the Las Vegas community as attested by the lines out the door during peak periods and is a great late night option.",

After 45 minutes, we were only told we'd be put at the big table (even though there were 4 person booths?) after the hostess (blonde w/ tattoos) saw us and realized we'd been there for so long. We didn't hear anything from her after that, and realized 3 groups of 2 and a group larger than ours that came in AFTER us got seated. There also appeared to be 2 other employees getting behind the hostess table but didn't really do much.  I understand things get busy, but the lack of communication from the hostess was disappointing especially since she knew how long we'd been waiting. Someone really needs to work with the hostesses on customer service. It seems like this is a recurring issue too, which is even more disappointing that nothing is being done about it despite responses saying they're welcoming feedback.",

The restaurant just didn't really have a friendly environment. Which, is probably affecting my reviewing rate quite a bit.   * The Jinya Bun tasted good, but it tasted like any other siopao. For $3, I guess that would be reasonable for any bun. We ordered the spicy chicken ramen and the original chicken ramen. The noodles had a different kind of texture that aren't typical for noodles. It reminded me of potato noodles, which are really good. The ramen itself, filled enough for one person, which is enough for us because we ordered 2.   * The prices ranged around $10-$20. I believe the noodles I ordered were around the price of $11-$12   * Would I go there again? Yeah, I think I would, to try the other kinds of ramen they have. As for the service, that's something they should probably work on. I'm not going back for the good service, but the good food.   * Rate: 6/10 * Price: $$",

That is the hardest thing to find that's perfect at ramen places and jinya is the absolute best in Vegas.   Also, I'm not huge on the pork chasu so I'm thrilled that jinya offers chicken! They have vegan/vegetarian options too which is pretty exciting. I think the best thing about them is their variety. I usually go for the spicy chicken ramen or the regular chicken ramen and it's amazing! Also the add ons are mostly a dollar so add some tofu, broccoli, corn, or my favorite... extra eggs!",

The A rating has returned. The whole staff greets every new table. The servers were all attentive without being annoying. It's absolutely remarkable how much they've changed and turned things around.   The food was already one of the best in town, but the philosophy changes also seemed to have made their way into food quality. While before, I may have internally debated which was the absolute best ramen in town, this place now wins. It's absurd good.  I usually get pork broth ramens, and I absolutely adore their spicy tonkotsu. It's completely fantastic. Just make sure you realize their spice levels are a little weird. It's mild then spicy and the spiciest level is hot. It is listed on the menu, but you might miss it. (Hot, their spiciest level is the best level. Although it still needs an extra spoonful of the table side hot sauce.)  One small qualm. Their seasoned eggs are served whole. I stopped ordering them, and I miss them. But I really wish they were cut in half. It looks better presentation wise and it's edible in halves.   Overall, go and eat here yesterday.",

They also have a couple good rice bowls if you're not in the mood for soup.   The place is popular and crowded on weekends so you often have to sit at the communal table. Also no seats available when waiting for a table.  It has fairly loud music so more appealing to hipster vibe than intimate setting.  Jinya is a bit more pricey than other ramen spots.",

The only problem with them that it is way too salty for my taste plus the place was so tiny I felt so claustrophobic.  I am not one for cramped spaces.    My husband is an especially picky eater, especially with Asian food, but he loves this.  I think he finally found a place that he cannot get sick of.  They offer such a variety of food that you cannot go wrong.  I love the ambiance of the restaurant.  Very cozy and casual.  The staff is on point when it comes to filling our drinks.  That is one of my biggest peeves is when the servers do not fill my drinks on a timely manner, but they do and I love it!  They are seriously on point when it comes to greeting us when we first come in.    My usual order is the Tonkotsu Asari.  Thank you BTW for not making salty.  I have a sensitive palatte so I am glad that you are able to add flavor without making me an enormous amounts of water.  My husband gets the Tonkotsu Spicy which he makes super hot.  It looks delicious, but I do not do spicy foods.  I think you guys made me a lover for the Takoyaki (Octopus Balls) and the Pork Chashu Bowl.  Yum!    This is definitely a place that we can eat with our friends and family.  My husband, cousin, and I are going to be regulars here.  People should seriously try this place out.  I cannot rave enough about this place.",

Even if you don't like ramen, there are rice choices too, like really yummy chicken and pork rice bowl we tried. We always order chicken karaage   in Japanese restaurants  and Jinya's  is pretty good but  the whole family agrees that yu-yu's  karage is still the best. I do not like the crispy rice tuna , because the soft tuna and the harder crispy rice, just didn't taste right. Anyhow, the takoyaki is the best as other's suggested with the tender octopus inside and crispy outside. I love the homemade tofu, but the dashi sauce might be little too sour.  Anyways, I strongly recommend Jinya ramen and looking forward to see who will win the ramen war in Vegas.",

    "text": "First impression: smelly and uncomfortable. We ordered two ramen bowls with two salads, a California roll, and chashu bowl. The salad dressing and the chashu bowl was salty and the ramen was bland and tasted like chicken broth straight from the box. The side of one of our bowls were not at all clean. Also one of the eggs in our ramen still had the shell attached to it. At first, the California tasted fine but then In the middle of the roll (which should be the best part) the avocado tasted strange. The service was nothing special. Overall, I don't understand the rave about this place. There was nothing that stands out especially compared to places such as Sora and Monta. Never again. What a waste of money. ( The restroom was very nice though )",

We started with the crispy shrimp ball it was really good I really recommend it as an appetizer. For our entree we got the spicy chicken ramen and you can choose how spicy from mild medium and hot and also the wanton chicken ramen which was really good I was afraid it wouldn't fill me up because it's soup but it actually is satisfying and filling.",

I am fresh off a plane and hungry beyond belief. They took several tables in front of us and took ages bussing to seat us.Very disappointing. It's been an hour man and then some.

We ordered our ramen and my friend had asked for extra noodles and we got the edamame to start. That was good , pretty much same garlic edamame you get everywhere . But the ramen came out and had ONLY 2 skinny pieces of pork for the whole bowl. Very thin and short pieces which I tried to conserve for the whole time I was eating . My friend's noodles came out about 5 minutes on a side plate... which we thought was kinda odd and we assume would have already been inside the bowl. The seasonings they provided were pretty good but I had to keep adjusting to get the right flavor I was looking for . Got some sake and Sapporo too to go along . But pretty bland broth with not too much flavor , maybe I'll give another try and order different bowl.",

    "text": "This extended weekend had been full of good eats, let's see if we can keep the streak going and what better place to do that than at the newly opened Cali transplant, Jinya Ramen Bar.    Jinya is located close to the hustling and bustling Vegas area with tourist and local traffic alike, just off Decatur and Flaming-O, away from the compettion on Spring Mountain.  Upon arrival, the place looked closed and includes a drive through that is not functional and uncertain if and when it will be up and running.  You will find the entrance on the Eastside of the building, trust me, it's there.  (Shouts to Downtown Cocktail Lounge's secret door)  Once we got in, it totally looked like and had the feel of a bar, only that you are taking shots of tonkotsu broth.   Actually, I took a peek at the alcohol menu and it was respectable.  Problem was the place reminded me of that \"dark dining\" phenomenon all over NYC cause it made me want to refund my Lasik work.  Hard to order when you can't see, just saying. Cool Victorian loop style light bulbs that were totally ineffective to say the least.  Somehow, the wifey was able to see done good friends and fellow Yelp elitists, Laurie and Derek, that did liven up the mood.   Oh yeah, weird to the wise... don't get  stuck with your dominant eating arm against the wall of you are seated in the tandem mini booth unless you want bruises.  It's tiny and requires an Orbitz baby seat to get in and out.   When it was time to order, I was saddened to learn that they were out of the tonkotsu asuri.  Not only that the shrimp toast and takoyaki was nowhere to be found as well.  So I opted for the Tokyo Tonkotsu Special, but to top it off (or lack of topping it off), Jinya was out of eggs too!  Kinda turning out yo be more like Jipya instead of Jinya!  I was slowly starting to think that the opening may have been premature.   The waitress was pleasant and from Hawaii.  She could easily tell we were too but is still subject to the same brutal scrutiny (if warranted) just line everyone else.  Oh girl just needs to expand her knowledge on the craft beer menu, but she got redemption by showing me each if the bottles and cans up close to get the real deal Holyfield.  The food came out rather quick and I gave it the broth test right off the bat and the verdict is...manslaughter, cause man did I slaughter the ish out the bowl, maybe it's because I hadn't eaten since breakfast at Rise and Shine this morning.  The flavor that stood out profoundly to me was the bonito flakes and the thick noodles was a Nice touch.  I can't Complain about the chashu though, the chicken chashu too.  I wonder if it is a stretch to say it rivals Monta's melt in yo mouth chashu?!? Not to mention we got double the chashu since they were out of everything we initially wanted.  The spicy shrimp tempura was mediocre at best, not traditional by any stretch of the imagination.  The mayo sauce, ehhhh not a fan, but the skrimpz were big but it still reminded me of buffet style and not impressive at all.  The seaweed Salad had more vegetable greens than seaweed and the pork belly bowl tasted a lot like rinsed adobo.  The wifey said the spicy chicken ramen was delicious though, you know what they say, happy wife, happy life.  What they lacked in menu items, they sure made up for in Cool Japanese craft beer and double chashu.  Some new interesting brews seen for the first time included, Yona Yona ale and Coedo Shikkoku, but went with the Suiyoubi No Neko.  No I'm not bi and yes I have a neck, but True translation is \"Wednesday (humpday) Cat,\" a Belgian style white that was especially good on Saturday chased down with almond pudding for dessert.  Oh yeah, they played good music that prompted me to give them a score of 3.2, would been a whole point higher had they dished out what we wanted.  Hopefully, the next round will get me editing this review in a positive way.",

    "text": "There's a new ramen restaurant in town and this is not just another ordinary ramen place capitalizing on the new ramen craze in Vegas like many other ramen places popping up around town. This ramen can actually compete with the big names like the Montas or the Soras. So be afraid...Monta, be very afraid...Sora, you finally got some real competition.  The menu is very extensive, you can actually have a complete meal here without having ramen, but since ramen was the reason I was here, that's exactly what I ordered. I went with their most popular which is the tonkotsu black, a very rich in flavor broth with pork chashu and the perfect toppings, fresh onions, fried onions, garlic, nori and a boiled egg and served with perfectly cooked thin noodles.  I had to try the pork broth this time for comparison purposes but on my next visit I'll provably be nicer to my heart and order the chicken broth instead or even the vegetable soup ramen and I hope they're as good as the pork so I can stop here more often without the guilty feeling.  Service was great, I had no problems with my drink being refilled as needed and my waitress was very helpful explaining the menu and making recommendations.  The dining room is very spacious with many booths and tables, a bar facing the open kitchen and a majestic communal table in the middle inviting strangers to become friends by the power of ramen if only for just one meal.  I can see Jinya Ramen becoming one of my favorite restaurants come winter, for I could definitely have ramen here every day, if only my arteries were twice as wide.  #happy hour 3 - 5  = useful.",

We ordered our food, which included 2 appetizers, and waited for 25 minutes before we noticed that people that were seated 15 min after us were already eating their meals and we hadn't even gotten our appetizers yet. When we finally said something to our waitress she came back and said that the kitchen was cooking it up right now, that she didn't have an iPad and had to manually put in our order and they were just really busy. What?? Why would three people that came in after us already have their food just because she had to manually put in our order? After that we watched her and somebody else scrambling to find our order. The truth is that our order completely got lost in the shuffle and they had just started working on it, which I understand happens but at least be honest about it instead of making something up lying to us. Honesty Integrity goes a long way. When the food finally did come out another 15 minutes later it was only for half of us and the rest of us got our food another 10 to 15 minutes after that. My son's kids meal which is supposed to come with a Ramen as well, was completely forgotten and he was never served.  The whole experience was really frustrating and I won't be back. The food was just okay and not worth going through that again. If they just would have acknowledged the situation and apologized that would have gone a long way and now they've lost a customer.",

    "text": "We decided to check out this new spot after our late night movie. We walked into the restaurant and it had a cool layout. There's a giant table in the middle with multiple booths surrounding it.   We were seated at this tiny booth for two along the wall. Then the server approached us, asking how our day was and in return she told us she's had a long day and it could have been better... Like what do you say back to that?! Awkwarddd...   Then she briefly explained the menu and their popular items and gave us literally 1 minute to look over the menu. I get that they are going for a dim dinner feel, but we could not see what the menu had to offer. We had to pull out the flashlight on our iPhones to read the menu. She came back but obviously we weren't ready, because we couldn't even read the menu to begin with..   Finally she came back and my boyfriend and I both picked out the spicy chicken ramen. I'm kind of a picky eater so I asked what each ingredient was. When I asked about the \"Tokyo Negi\" she literally stood there for 30 seconds, blank stare, not knowing how to explain what it was.... So I just asked for that on the side.   I added mushrooms, corn, and butter. As she was taking our order on the iPad, I had to repeat over and over what I wanted.. Again she said, sorry it's been a long night..     After that I went to the ladies room. I was surprised by their high tech toilet that lifted up by itself when it felt my motion near it. It even had a seat warmer lol! And that was the highlight of my experience there, pretty much hah....   Finally, our food came out and I didn't see the butter or the mushrooms..  Pretty bummed out, but I didn't say anything. I was so hungry, that I could not  wait any longer. My stomach was growling all day.  Overall the food was good, but I still like Monta Ramen wayyy better!!   Their service definitely needs improvement if they want to compete with the others.",

    "text": "Wow where do i begin. I was suprised to find this place on this side of town. Everything around this area has a local feel to it but this place is a well run business chain. They have good servers. Everyone seems happy to work here. The price is perfect for what you get. They have a small menu that I wish was bigger because everything they offer taste good, but I understand they kept it small to help the food get out faster. They seem to make up for it by letting you customize everything (example size of noodles). I recommend the house Ramon and Japanese style fried chicken with an extra side of lemon. Put the lemon on the chicken and it taste authentic, like in japan.  Service-5 price-5 business flow-5  menu-4 food quality-5",

Ordered a pint of Sapporo, Spicy Chicken Ramen and Gyoza. The broth for the Spicy Chicken Ramen was very flavorful and had the right amount of spice. I wasn't so sure, but I think they make their own gyoza. Anyway, I couldn't say is the best Japanese Ramen I had; however, I would rate Jinya ramen as one of the top 5 Ramen I had in my life.",

The prices are really good in my opinion, $15 total for drink, salad, Cali roll, and ramen was great. I still prefer Sora because I feel their broth is just so nice and rich, and they have a much nicer service. What I didn't like is not being able to sit at a table when I was only waiting for one other person and there were seven empty tables and the place wasn't busy at all. It was also pretty funny when the couple behind me had complained about not being able to get seated when it was just them and they were staring at a wall of empty tables.",

If your in Vegas and looking for a life changing foodie experience? This is your spot.     This place gets packed and is super busy but the service is still amazing. Super friendly staff big smiles and very helpful. The server actually helped me choose the dish I enjoyed today. Whatever your paying them pay them more okay thanks lol   The environment is full of energy and up beat And I  also like that they have a huge community like table in the middle of restaurant it looks like it helps bring people together and I enjoy that idea, bonding over food or meeting new people is what it's all about.     The ramen dish I had today is called Tonkonstu Black excuse me if I spelled that wrong to lazy to change it lol. But omg I was legit mind blown by this dish. The broth was perfect I let it sit there for lil bit and it started creating a layer of film on top that's how rich it is! The pork was excellent so flavorful. The noodles are pretty thin but they're able to hold on to a lot of broth. If I had anything to knit pick about it would have to be the egg. I wish the egg was cut in half instead of being whole. So for the ramen and a coke I payed just under 15 bucks and trust me it was worth every penny.     Come and visit these guys and find out what all the hype is about I guarantee you'll be impressed and full lol. I do recommend go go go!!",

Can't really justify paying for $12 for just broth, noodles, and a few chunks of spinach and chicken wontons. Any additional items like fried onions is an extra charge. (Much prefer Pho in my opinion).   Came here for dinner on a Saturday evening around 6 ish. I've read reviews before coming here so I was prepared for either a wait and/or sitting at the communal table. There weren't any private tables left so option 2 ended up happening. All good though....the restaurant is pretty loud....nobody can really eavesdrop in your conversation.  My friend and I both ordered the chicken wonton ramen bowl, I opt mine for the spicy version. Flavor was delicious and portions were plentiful. Service was good. If you like garlic, make sure you get a side of fresh garlic to add to your broth. It seriously made the flavor 10x better!! Just be prepared for strongggggg garlic breath the rest of the night!  Would I be back? Sure, if someone wants/craving ramen or something. But I def wouldn't choose this on my own.",

The menu offers a great variety of ramen bowls and everything to go with it. I like that they offer combination options to add salads, gyoza, or other appetizers on to your ramen order. The calorie counts next to each item is great too! I love making an informed decision between menu items.   Creating a combination meal out of my ramen I went with adding salad and gyoza. The salad had leafy greens and plenty of fresh, chunky ginger dressing. This salad is made for those that love ginger. The gyoza was tender and had a nicely flavored filling.  The Spicy Chicken Ramen was delicious. The broth was really good and there were plenty of noodles. I was offered extra noodles if the original portion wasn't enough. The chicken was tender, but I'd love to try another meat next time since it wasn't overly flavorful. I went with mild since I wasn't sure of their spice level. It worked out fine because I was able to add spice at the table to make it spicier. Overall, this was the first time I ate my entire bowl at a ramen restaurant because it was so good.   My friend ordered the Wonton Ramen and I was lucky enough to try a wonton. Wow! The wontons were so delicate and the meat filling inside was very flavorful. I might have to order this instead on my next visit.   The service was excellent. We had a couple of waitresses that served us and checked on us. Our waters were constantly refilled and everyone was friendly. Our food came out quickly too.",

This is a small spot so I recommend calling ahead to see if there's a wait, or they do have the option of the community table in the center.   My usual is the vegan ramen and the house hot sake. The flavor is so delicious! They also have happy hour during the week until 5pm. The cauliflower appetizer is on the happy hour menu and it's on point.   Highly recommend this place.   Pros: dimly lit atmosphere, good music, flavors are delicious! happy hour prices, and great service    Cons: small restaurant inside, so there's usually a wait for a table   Tip** I would recommend calling ahead of time to see if there is a wait",

    "text": "I came to this place pretty excited after hearing a bunch of locals recommend it. I heard it was better than Monta which was pretty good and had high expectations that weren't met. You walk in and see its a pretty cool and hip type of restaurant that focuses on more of a bar/lounge than an actual ramen spot. We were seated in the back where I had a great view of the restaurant noticing that most of the patrons were young hipsters which worried me, not a lot of Asians were eating there which was an immediate bad sign. Our server was nice and started us off with a beer, water, and spicy tuna tacos per his recommendation.   The Spicy tuna tacos were more of a well portioned scoop of spicy tuna on top of a wonton type taco shell with 2 thinly sliced jalapenos. It was a mild spicy but fresh taste to the tacos which I would give a 4/5.  I ordered their most popular ramen which had brussel sprouts in it. It was a good change but a little outside of Traditional ramen. I'm completely fine with good spins on food, but the noodles were thick, and broth was kind of flavorless. No options in picking your type of broth and type of noodles which kind of sucks since the best ramen places in Japan, or even little tokyo Los Angeles let you pick. i asked the server for some of the pickled radish which they didnt have... so he gave me ginger which is still good but the ginger was stuck together as if it was packaged in airtight plastic. It was then that I noticed we were missing the egg, which was a huge sell point for me. Both of our bowls were missing it and the server was surprised that they were missing. Clearly the kitchen made the mistake, but it was just another let down. 2/5   I give it a 3 since the service was good and the environment would be a great place to go with friends or on a date. But the food quality was mediocre if you have only had generic ramen. Of the dozen or so ramen spots I have had, this would probably be ranged #9 or 10. Not great, not bad but still better than top ramen.",

    "text": "The reviews for this place are incredible, so on a Wednesday night with the Palms slammed with people we ventured over to Jinya. It's s little after 5:30pm, and the place isn't that busy so we get a seat right away. Waitress is extremely helpful asking if we've dined with them before (we had not, so we're off to the races!)  Decide on two ramen dishes: wonton and brussel sprout pork chassu (both done spicy). The spicy meter here has three levels, essentially a mild, medium and hot. We both want flavor (and to feel our tongues after) so we go medium. Waitress agrees this is a good call as there is sauce on the table to spice things up if need be.  Ramens come out shortly after... Wonton dish is week, but brussel dish is heavenly. Both could have been done at maximum spice levels (Neither really super hot). Odd thing is in both dishes there are cold items (it's a hot soup dish, right?)  I'd get the brussel dish again, but the wonton dish killed ever going back (Shanghai Artisan Noodle is tight down the street... it's our GoTo and even does UberEats!)  So here's the rundown: Satisfied? Yes/No Return? No (Maybe takeout, but takeout Ramen?) Advocate? Yes/No",

The look in there is very modern but with a warm feel kind of like an NYC Restaurant. It's good for smaller groups or even a casual date.  For appetizers we had the fried chicken appetizer, the creamy avocado salmon, the creamy shrimp tempura and gyoza. All of it was really good. I wish the chicken would come with a sauce though. My favorite is the shrimp tempura.  Then for ramen we all had the jinya chicken ramen. I had cheese added and it was a really good pairing. What a really neat place!",

I've had them before in other ramen joints. The broth was a very yellow chicken base reminiscent of packaged ramen seasoning. Different but not impressive. I'm not one to waste food or even have leftovers but I didn't finish my bowl. Normally my plate is devoured in under five minutes. Worth a try but nothing to rave about.",

I came through a few minutes earlier than opening time. (No biggie.) I noticed I wasn't the only one waiting for their doors to open, so that's a good sign. Didn't waste any time soon as they flipped their CLOSED to OPEN sign.   Like most ramen places, it isn't that big but there is plenty of seating available. Asked if we have visited before. I mentioned my LA stop, and since that's been awhile...   I asked if they had the lobster me happy bowl (since I didn't see it on the menu.)   A disappointing, \"No.\" and an apology immediately following it. Again, no biggie. Ended up with the Jinya tonkatsu black combo'd with karaage and salad. Also ordered a side of fresh garlic and wontons.   And just like the LA spot, it was DELISH!!!!! The depth and flavor of the broth were perfect. The chashu was brined well and it was moist and tender. The wonton didn't really do anything to do bowl, but it was good anyway. Dressing on the salad came off a bit strong but bearable. The crispy chicken (aka karaage) was made to order pleasant! Good crunch on the outside, juicy inside.   My friend said she's never been here, but now that it's on her radar, she's definitely coming back. With a crew!   FOOD: 5. SERVICE: 5. VALUE: 5. PARKING: Private lot but shared with other businesses.  OVERALL: 5.   My friend and I had nothing to complain about. The dining experience was perfect.   And no, I'm not gonna ding them just because they didn't have my first choice. Hell, it's not even on the menu. All I can do is hope they have it next time! (Yes, there will be a next time!)",

From the happy hour menu we ordered Jinya Buns and Salmon Poke Tacos, which were both absolutely delicious. I think the star of the show was definitely the Takoyaki, which are these soft amazing octopus balls. I usually don't like octopus or squid because the texture is too chewy for me, but the takoyaki was a flavor bomb in your mouth, I highly recommend it. For the entree, I got a small chashu pork bowl which was pretty good. I can't wait to come here again.",

I remember the one with black garlic was good. I love that they have chicken ramen and vegetarian ramen. I recently tried the creamy, vegetarian ramen with egg and it was so bomb!   They also have a nice selection of appetizers and side dishes. The sweet potatoes were cool, but a bit too starchy for my taste.   What sets Jinya apart from other ramen places is that they have happy hour and reverse happy hour! Would love to come back and try a bunch of apps and sides.   Service here has always been prompt and friendly!",

For $3, you get a lot of salmon poke which is nice. We ordered their karaage as well but that was just...eh. We didn't finish it.  For our entrees, I ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen with an onsen tamago and sweet corn. My bf ordered the tonkotsu black ramen. The broth was really nothing to write home about...if anything, it was a little too salty and too oily for my liking. It was lacking the depth of flavor that a traditional tonkotsu has. Even with the \"tonkotsu black\" ramen which is apparently sooo good because it has \"black garlic\" - really, nothing to see here, folks. It's just garlic and the broth is still not that great. The noodles were cooked well and the chashu was melt-in-your-mouth tender and well-seasoned, but overall the ramen just wasn't memorable. Our server was friendly but also pretty unhelpful when we asked for recommendations. We would ask things like \"between ____ and ____ which one do you like better?\" and he would just say random stuff about both of them and not actually give us a definitive answer. Also, I don't understand why the toppings come on different side plates...I've never been to a ramen place that serves it that way. Weird...on the bright side, the restaurant itself looks nice???? I'm trying to find more good things to say about Jinya, but I'm honestly out of ideas lol.",

It kinda has a sweet taste, I would go back just for that.  The ramen itself honestly was just like any other ramen house. The amount and size can be a bit decieving though. The bowl is larger than most places but they don't fill it up. I didnt feel full and I finished the whole thing which is very rare. So maybe mine was just smaller?!?   Our server was really nice. She explained the menu to us since we had never been there before and she gave us time to look it over. She came back a few times to check on us and asked how everything was. Overall the experience was pleasant.   I would go back if in the area.",

I don't remember our servers name but he was an Asian guy with glasses. We ordered our food along with our waters seeing that a huge rush was coming. I'm a vegan so I ordered the Spicy Vegan Ramen. Once our server found out i was a vegan he took it one step further by letting me know what i can and cannot have on he table along with telling me what was in the appetizer that I couldn't have. This impressed me and made me feel comfortable. We also ordered the sweet potato sticks and we could've done without them. The presentation was cute but the taste wasn't that good and texture was hard. (If you're vegan don't eat the dip it has honey) Our ramen on the other hand was Probably one of the beat ramens I've ever had. I didn't want it to end and the people around us also couldn't stop talking about how good it was.",

    "text": "Came here for the second time with my parents that were here from out of town. They loved it the first time. So we decided let's have it again! Man did we make a mistake & man oh man did we wait. We had a party of 8 which yes I know it was huge (for this place) we knew we were going to wait no doubt about that 45-min to an hour tops. After about an hour we were told we were next so we headed inside to wait because it was cold. Not a surprise, not much space to wait. We were like sardines huddled near the front door, but hey when we were told we were next we assumed we were going to be seated within what 5 minutes or less maybe? Not the case at all! The host made the mistake of seating a party of 3 right smack dab in the middle of our table which made our wait an extra hour!!!!! Why?!!!!! Why would you seat another party in the middle of our table (you know the only big table in the middle of the room). You could've seated them in one of the 2 empty booths that were available We weren't the only ones that noticed that huge mistake. A couple waiting right next to us said \" wow I can't believe they did that!\" So we stood there inside for an extra hour just dumbfounded. It seriously ruined the mood for us which sucked because we were in such great spirits that day.  When we were finally seated, no I'm sorry about the wait which was our mistake. No we apologize about that. Just seated. The waitress gave us water, asked if we wanted anything else besides water and then took our order. (Which she almost forgot to take orders from 3 others in my party wtf?!! I had to point to them and tell her \" they need to order as well\" We were seated all together are you not paying attention?!) She never came back after taking our order?? 3 other servers/bus boys came to give us our food which is fine I understand, it happens all the time. But NOBODY checked on us, didn't ask how's everything? need a refill? Etc.   The food was good, no complaints about that! Which is why we came back obviously. Trust me we ate it all up after waiting so damn long!   NOTE: We still gave them a 20% tip because I would never ever not leave just nothing, that's just not me and it's just rude! But we all left so upset which sucked so bad. I haven't seen my parents in a long time and we wanted to have a good time. My mom told me that this was the last time we were coming here and despite how much I love or should I say loved this place, I would have to agree after last night. This is the last time we're coming here!   Sorry JINYA. You could've stepped up your game and offered us some type of compensation for our 2 hour wait due to YOUR terrible mistake. (Free sodas? One free appetizer? A little discount off our meal? I don't know the possibilities are endless!) it would've made us feel like you were trying to show some type of apologetic gesture, but we were left with \"a real bad taste in our mouth\". Maybe I'll consider coming back when you guys MAYBE OPEN A BIGGER LOCATION? TRAIN STAFF ON CUSTOMER SERVICE? SHOW YOUR CUSTOMERS YOU ACTUALLY CARE?   Suggestion to others: Don't even bother coming here if you have a party bigger than 4-6. I'm dead serious. (Unless you enjoy waiting??) Honestly it's just an absolute nightmare. Trust me.",

It doesn't look like you typical ramen shop rather a Japanese style bar.  Service is usually very good.  Check out their Happy Hour 3-5pm, 10pm-12am.  *Update: I had a quinoa kale salad with goma sesame dressing, which I forgot to mention in my review, and I really liked it.

It comes with a child's portion chicken ramen- corn and spinach. The little boat that accompanied had two friend chicken nuggets, fries, a side of rice and teriyaki chicken, orange slice and salad.

Less then a year ago i gave this place a high rating, i'm not sure if its new management or if they just have been having some off days. Ramen is not as good as it use to be. But besides that it's decent. After work we usually eat here, or pho. But last night we chose Jinya. I ordered the cilantro one with thick noodles. When I received my bowl I noticed it had thin noodles. Ok,  easy fix right? I got the attention of a server passing by and let her know I asked for thick noodles. She took my bowl back to the pass and after talking over my bowl with the young lady who toll my order. She brings my bowl back and says \"the supervisor said she took your order and you didn't order thick\" . So now I'm stumped.  The supervisor walks over and says \"you didn't order thick noodles\". I reminded her that I did. She said she couldn't remake it but they could give me thick noodles on the side. I wasn't in the mood for double noodles. So I just declined the offer and took my bowl as is. (After it was passed around). It's after work and I was hungry. I'm 7 months pregnant and was craving a bowl of ramen with thick noodles. We were finishing our meal she comes back to apologise and offers me a free ice cream.  Because ice cream covers all mistakes. I said no thank you. She comes back with a pre plated dessert and again said \"I'm sorry you are upset\". No She was not. She could have easily fixed and remade my bowl but she decided she didn't want to since she didn't want to admit she made a mistake. I work in the industry and was baffled by the service.",

    "text": "Officially open for less than a week.  I would've thought this ramen joint has always been here.  Service is definitely a top priority here.  The choices are nominal and the prices are extremely low.  The tapas have some unique cliches.  Such as the Truffled Brussels Sprouts Tempura. Light tempura crunch into brussels snap then the sharp taste of strong truffle oil.  The aroma of truffle is so strong it can be sensed at the next table.  Real or not I'd take any kind of black truffle flavor I can in the summer. 4/5  The sticky bun pork sliders were soo tender.  I would say the pork was cooked over night.  The bun was soft fresh and delicate.  The light sweet sauce and arugula finish it off as my favorite asian slider to date.  All so tender it made me eat it slowly. 4.5/5  Takoballs were arranged in a line of six.  Lightly golden fried with a little slice of baby octopi in them.  They are nested atop an egg salad cream.  Flavor was not too prominent but the textures were nice.  3.5/5  Crispy Chicken was only 3$ for 5 pieces during HH.  They were crispy and not dry in any way inside.  White meat and heavy portioned there was a small dash of that Japanese signature salad.  A little bit of dipping sauce (ponzu?) it was a nice filler. 3.5/5  The Tonkotsu Black is the more formal ramen here.  It has everything in it.  Seaweed, soft boiled egg, fried onions, etc. with small noodles.  Now this is the thicker broth of chicken and pork with 2 slices of tender pork medalion.  So rich and not salty at all.  I imagined turtle soup would be this thick.  This is the best bowl of ramen I've had in town & I've been to Japan.  So if I hadn't I'd say it was the best I've ever tried.. 4.5/5  For dessert we had a whipped almond custard that had chopped fruit.  Only 2$ during HH!  Modern eastern minimalist decor, of which I have a fetish.  Notable service.  Damn good ramen!  4.5 star restaurant.",

    "text": "Jinya Ramen Bar is another competitor to hop into the already saturated Vegas ramen scene. I would probably put it on the #3 spot in terms of best ramen spots in Las Vegas. Two things I like about this place is the inclusion of happy hour (3-5pm) and super late hours (open until 3am).  I've had the chance to try both the spicy chicken and tonkotsu varieties over here. The spicy chicken broth has some savory kick (with a choice of mild, spicy, and extra spicy). The tonkotsu broth here is rich and creamy, reminiscent of Monta. Only miss is that the pork chashu was a bit more tough than I'm accustomed to. The pork belly at other ramen spots are much more \"melt in your mouth\" worthy. Here's a rundown of what I've had:  -Crispy chicken (5 pcs): Nice big pieces of chicken karage. Doesn't beat what Fukumimi offers, but it does its job, especially during happy hour prices ($3). 4/5 stars. -Gyoza: Really tasty gyoza here. I wouldn't mind ording another round next time I come by. 4/5 stars. -Curry rice: Nothing really stood out with the curry here. Standard Japanese curry over rice. Not bad, but not amazing either. 3/5 stars.  -Spicy chicken ramen: Rich chicken broth filled with the usual components in a ramen bowl. I was kind of bummed that this was one menu item that didn't come with an egg. I had to add it myself ($1). I really liked it. They give a choice of mild, spicy, and extra spicy. 4/5 stars.  -Jinya Tonkotsu Ramen: Here's that rich and creamy pork broth that I love. Probably my favorite bowl of ramen here. 4.5/5 stars.  -Almond tofu dessert: A creamy almond tofu pudding complemented by kiwi, peach and strawberry fruit topping. This was much more delicious than I expected. 5/5 stars.  I definitely see myself coming back here. The vibe that this place offers is very \"L.A.\" It's hip, modern, and very upbeat. It's much more accommodating as a hangout/date spot than most other ramen bars out there. I like the fact that they have a happy hour, which makes things very reasonable.  Note: Happy hour is daily, from 3pm-5pm. Plenty of drink specials and $3-5 apps.",

    "text": "The Skinny: although not the best ramen I've ever had, this might be the best bowl of tonkotsu ramen in the Las Vegas area so far. That being said, I'd skip the spicy chicken ramen. The truffled brussel sprouts are brilliant (3.5) service: prompt and helpful (4) value: a bit pricier than its counterparts, it's definitely worth a trip (4 starred review).  We were stalking Jinya on Facebook to check for its grand opening - eager to find a decent ramen joint in town. We managed to come in on the second day of opening. It was so good, we dropped by the next day with a pal to take in their happy hour specials.  First, the ambience. I think the tendency for this joint is to turn up the tunes - loud. Although their music selection is good (MJ is classic), I kind of prefer not having to shout across the table to the hubs. Luckily the manager is accomodating and turned it down a notch for the comfort of my tympanic membranes. The decor is comfortable - lots of open spaces with variable methods of seating. Bathrooms are nice and clean - the women's bathroom even sports a real Japanese toilet with heated seat, bidet, and butt dryer.  Service is prompt and friendly while our water glasses were never left unfilled.   On to the food.  In our two visits we were able to try multiple items:   Tonkotsu Black Ramen ($10.55): the broth: overall, not bad. There is some porky depth to their broth which as appealing and the flavor wasn't too muddled with other things. On a broth scale, they'd get a 3.5/5. The noodles are the thin traditional hakata style tonkotsu noodles which gets extra bonus points. These were cooked well and had a nice bite to it (4/5). The toppings: the chasu had a nice soy flavor to it, and melted in your mouth. The egg was a tad overcooked for my tastes (I like it a little more runny) but again marinated well (4/5). In terms of tonkotsu ramen, I'd say this is a 3.5/5 on a ramen scale which would put it decidedly as one of the best bowls of ramen we've had in the Las Vegas Area. I think this is first joint in Las Vegas where we'd ever finish all the broth.  Spicy Chicken Ramen ($9.55): their number two most popular ramen. The broth: although the broth had a nice thickness to it, it just didn't have enough chicken flavor. On a broth scale, it was about a 2/5. The noodles were the typical curly thicker noodles which were done well 4/5. The toppings: the chicken chasu was tough and didn't melt in your mouth like the pork chasu. Served with bean sprouts, green onion and spinach, the toppings here didn't wow me (2/5). This ramen bowl would get a 2/5 and I wouldn't recommend it.  Brussel Sprout tempura with truffle oil and salt ($5.80): this is the only time I've ever seen the hubs voluntarily gobble down brussel sprouts. The batter was crisp, light with just the right amount of salt.. When combined with the truffle oil, the flavors worked really well together. A must try item!  Tako-yaki ($4.80): served on a bed of egg salad, this rendition of tako-yaki was good with nice flavor. The filling was light without the being too gummy. It could be a bit crispier on the outside but otherwise a good decent dish with a very healthy serving size for the price.  Happy Hour Special items include Jinya bun ($3), Crispy chicken ($3/5 pcs), Jinya Quinoa Salad ($3), Edamame ($2), Marinated Spinach ($2), Baby Leaf Salad ($2), An-Nin Tofu (sweet almond tofu with fruit, $2).   Jinya bun ($3): this is a steamed bun with a slice of pork belly with some lettuce, cucumber and a drizzle of sweet soy sauce marinade. The bun was steamed perfectly and had that perfect texture. The ratio of meat/bun was good. The pork belly melts in your mouth although it was a little fatty. The time we had it, I think it was a tad sweet but otherwise the flavors and textures were very good. The buns are larger than you think. Would recommend trying this.  Crispy Chicken ($3/5 pcs): this is a very large portion size of karaage for the price. To be honest, the crispy chicken was a little on the dry side on the inside for me albeit very crisp on the outside as advertised. I'm not sure if I would order this again.  Marinated Spinach ($2): sprinkled with sesame seeds, this was dish was marinated in a sweet soy sauce. Overall, it was okay but not something I felt I needed to order again.  Baby Leaf Salad ($2): I found the dressing to be a bit watery and under seasoned - could probably use a bit more onion in the dressing to make the flavors in the daikon dressing pop. I'd probably skip on this one.  An-Nin Tofu ($2): this is almost like an almond tofu mousse in texture and incredible soft. For my tastes, it didn't have quite enough almond taste to but it was nice and light. Not a bad dessert, may order it again if we come for happy hour again.  Given that they make one of the better bowls of ramen in the Las Vegas area, I would recommend you come in for their tonkotsu ramen and the brussel sprouts tempura.

It was really devastating cause it was my sister and her family's first time here and her son and husband (who was feeding him and breaking apart chicken pieces) were sick for days and struggling to hold down food for about a week after. We came here on the evening of January 4th and it wasn't till just a few days ago they recovered from it. All I ask is more caution or cleanliness is exercised especially in the kids meal because my nephew couldn't understand what was wrong with him and why that was happening.",

    "text": "Plenty of seating in a hip, mood-setting restaurant. But don't be fooled, this isn't some limited menu fancy ramen. They do a ton of recipes here. Even the tonkotsu varies. I'm interested in trying the other broths despite loving what we got this time around. I think people will also be pleasantly surprised by the selection of appetizers. I have my eye on the takoyaki. Also enjoyed the excellent service. We must have come after the rush because everyone was pepped up but not many tables were full. This is what we enjoyed:  Tonkotsu Black: buttery oily broth, thinner noodles al dente/perfect, chashu with melty slippery fat, uncut marinated boiled egg (wish it was softer yolk, but still good taste), a couple nori sheets, just the right amount of garlic oil, green onions, crunchy onions (so savory), and a tiny dallop of chili paste. This was great. Spicy crazed folks may enjoy adding the chili paste to it, which is at every table.  Tokyo Tonkotsu (Special): chunky savory broth was very good- had onion chunks, but toward the end tasted very salty, same chashu-egg-nori-green onions, and bonito flakes. This one tasted much better than the black, but was also insanely savory. No need for any additional condiments.  Overall we were very happy with our visit and look forward to trying everything on the menu. I suggest making a special trip to try this spot.",

    "text": "Everybody compares every ramen place to the next so I will as well.  While this place isn't the best ramen I've had in town, (shout out to ramen sora) it is hands down the second best I have had.  The menu is definitely larger than ramen sora and seems a lot more hip in that there are different appetizer combinations and items to try like tacos.  The place itself is in an old fast food building which seemed odd at first but is really nicely decorated inside and was very welcoming!  Every time I have been here there has been a line out the door so that shows that it is definitely doing something right.  They have their ramens that you can get but there is a so a high level of customization that you can do to make it how you like, although everything is a la carte (not expensive though).  Too me the broth seemed a lot thicker than other places I have been to, almost like a gravy, which isn't a bad thing by far, just different.  I do like how you can make a combo meal though with a salad, rice bowl of some type, and your ramen.  Oh and ramen only comes in one size although you can add fresh noodles to your broth during the meal!",

    "text": "OK, so...I've been going to Jinya for a while. Like, a few years. I've had almost everything on the menu, and honestly don't expect much from the staff. I used to love the food, but lately the quality has gone down. I've had maybe two or three servers deliver good service throughout all the times i've gone. But man, tonight might've just ruined it for me. So on a weekend expect to wait 30-45 minutes. I really don't care, it's not the staff's fault, and I'm used to waiting the long periods of time. So we sit down, me and my bf order three beers, but our server informs us she can only give us two, and we have to finish them before we get the third. Weird, since she didn't even card us. Strange (and fairly new, at least they never did that before) policy, but it's not her fault. We get our jinya buns, which were excellent. It was all downhill from there. We ordered the salmon poke tacos, which are normally better. These were utterly soaked in whatever marinade they used, it spilled out of the taco and completely overpowered everything. We got the spicy creamy shrimp tempura, and it overall it tasted good. But the takoyaki was a complete mess. Not worth the money at all. Not worth anything. It disappointed me because I had wanted to try it for so long. It was extremely bland, it had the consistency of soggy stuffing with very little actual octopus, and there was no egg tartar... only a mess of mayo and sauce as a 'bed'. And the California Poke bowl... another thing I had wanted to try for so long that was a huge let down. The portion of spicy tuna was incredibly small- the amount of ginger they gave me was actually a bit bigger than the scoop of spicy tuna. Couldn't even eat it with the rice because whatever sauce they used they just decided to get a giant ladle and pour it over. I had to leave 1/3 of it because it was actually sitting in a pool of sauce!! They gave it to us with spicy mayo which was very thin- more like a liquid mayo based dressing. The dressing tasted alright (we used it to make the takoyaki taste better- actually like something instead of bland soggy bread) but it was no match for the sauce they used in the bowl. I would have complained, but our server never came back to us once we ordered. Another busser/server took our plate away too quickly to get his attention. I'm not sure if they didn't hear us over the insanely loud music or they were just ignoring us. It wasn't until 15 minutes after we finished that someone (a different server) came up, realized we were missing a drink (the beer we never received), and got it for us. Again, all too quickly to talk about how bad the food was. He came, and just dropped off the beer and receipt at once, and hurried away. I gave up trying to get their attention. Not once did anyone ask me how everything was, how the food tasted, how my experience was, or anything. Only thanked me after paying. As much as I loved Jinya, that was probably one of the worst food experiences I've had. And no, we never did see our server again.",

First visit was a wonderful drunken night. Didn't matter that the guy serving us completely forgot our order or that 30 mins into sitting he had to ask us what we ordered again. I was just happy to see food when it finally came! Which yes, was absolutely delicious. So hey, I thought to myself.. try this place sober. Living 30 minutes way triggered me to call on and place a pick up order. This being my second visit I'm not too familiar with the menu. Mind you, I also did not have one in front of me. The employee who answered the phone was very sweet at first... but quickly did that change when there was confusion on the menu. Friends that I am also picking up for gave me the details of \" don't get me the black, I don't like how it taste\". So I explained that to her only to get a massive amount of attitude and a condescending tone. She sounded extremely frustrated that I didn't know the menu. To the point that I felt uncomfortable even ordering. I almost hung up and said forget about but due to already almost being there I sucked it up. I did just drive from one side of town to the complete opposite. I've been out of school for 9 years. If I felt like being schooled and schooled about a menu.. I would get a job in the industry serving.",

I personally liked the way the thicker noodles soaked up the broth and were easier to eat with the spoon but the broth of both bowls was so great. I got my chicken bowl with medium heat and it was just enough to add a kick but still allow you to taste all the ingredients. We also tried the fried shrimp balls. They were delicious and not greasy or too filling - they're creamy on the inside and full of fresh shrimp chunks. The fried chicken appetizer is some of the best fried chicken you'll try. The service is great and someone is always checking in on you to make sure everything is going well.",

I've been to several spots throughout southern California and Vegas and this place was by far was the worst out of the ramen spots. Even ten Rens tea time that doesn't even specialize in ramen has better tasting tonkotsu ramen. I ordered the tonkotsu with an extra side of chashu. At first I was enjoying the broth and the Noodles. The broth was the only reason I didnt give it a one star. I then proceeded to biting into the chashu (pork) and it tasted bland and to top it off, it was cold. I couldn't believe it and I even had to ask a waiter why this was. She said that jinya serves their chashu cold. That's when I ordered the side of chashu to see if it was True. I got it and felt it and yep it was cold AF. I couldn't believe it.. Other than the over all dish tasting OK, the service was great and the enviroment was chill. Will not be coming back because I look for ramen that wows me and the ramen was underwhelming at best.",

I love the option they give you for the level of how hot you want it, being that I like my food on the spicier side. My go to is the Tonkatsu Spicy Ramen with the fat noodles and an egg, but adding the gyoza makes it even better. I definitely love the fact that I never have to wait to be seated. I don't know if I just showed up at the perfect time or they're just amazing!!",

The pork bun, the gyoza, the delicious, pulpy dressing on the salad, the tokyo curry rice. Everything the kitchen puts out is full of flavor - all of them, good.

The inside is cute-sy with the big family style table in the middle, with booths bordering the building. JINYA has a drive-thru although probably not usable.   I liked the idea of being able to order Chicken Karaage in varying amounts without seeming like we were ordering 83294023809438 orders. :)  The ramen was flavorful - I got the spicy tonkotsu (pork and chicken broth) with extra corn and a flavored egg.

It was overloaded with green Onions and a bit too much bean sprouts.  Garlic was the last flavor I can taste and I just didn't get the Garlic lover at all from it.  But overall the ramen bowl was pretty good, thick sauce and thick noodles and I love that about it.  I didn't mind the overload of green onions but the bean sprout was too much for my preference. Every bite was surely crunchy but at the same time every crunch of the bean sprout was diluting the flavor of ramen itself.  Meat was okay, in my opinion and the egg the came with it was pretty cold in the center and i didn't like that.  For 14$, I did not appreciate the value as it is not worth it for me. Overall I'd give this ramen bowl a 4 star and the place itself a 5 star for the great customer service.",

JINYA was empty and service was fantastic that day. Service is still great, but dang, the lines are out the door.  We tried almost every side item and of course, the ramen.  There's so many options here that it's very easy to be undecided on what to get.  My favorite was their Tonkotsu Black Ramen w/2 extra eggs and extra seaweed. I love the noodles and the creamy broth.  What makes JINYA so good is their consistency.  The taste, textures, and portions are always on point.  But if you ask what I enjoy the most here, it's their Chicken Chashu Bowl.  I will get this with an extra side of chicken and some extra eggs.  This is a \"must try\" if you're here and want something other than ramen.  It's so good.  I will usually get the small with very little rice and pack on the extra proteins. That's how it's done, folks.  No Ramen, No Life!  That's their motto. My JINYA motto...\"No Chicken, No Life\".     TIP #1:  Long waits because everyone loves JINYA  TIP #2:  Happy Hour Menu is from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM (super deals on side items)  TIP #3:  Please caption your photos.  Even my fork pictures have captions. I hate showing our server a picture on Yelp and telling them \"I want this. I don't know what it is, but I want this\".  Please Yeeps!!

The broth was very flavorful an unlike anything I had ever experienced.  It is very different from pho or any other soup. It is a class of its own, and it's world class.  The egg was the most flavorful egg Ive ever had. Some ramen comes with egg, some you can add it on for $1, which I will always do if it doesn't come with it, it was that good. The only issue I had with the ramen was the broth was a tad too salty for my preference, hence the 4.9 stars, lol.   The famous Jinya bun was amazing.  Get this. Go during happy hr and its only  $3. It's got delicious pork, yummy sauce, and greens bundled up into a pillowing steamed bun like a taco.  Highly reccomend.  Busy place, we were seated right away but we got lucky. Parties behind us had a wait time. Its always a good sign when a place is poppin during normal slow hrs on a monday!",

Ordered a Sapporo (kinda warm and flat)... the crispy chicken (really good).. and a jinya bun. The bun itself was meh, but the inside was good!  Ordered a veggie ramen and added pork and chicken to it. Added an onsen egg (best part of the bowl.. except they had to bring it out on the side. Forgot it?).   Lackluster ramen. Pretty bland. Noodles are average. Chicken was alright, the pork was good, but again, lacked any seasoning or flavors. Much potential! Also, the food was much better this go round than my first try here (crispy Brussels, jinya bun, tonkotsu).   Service was iffy but friendly.",

The place gets packed, and you'll see people outside waiting to be called. I like that there's plenty of parking space, and thankfully we didn't have to wait very long.  I had the Spicy Chicken Ramen and it was very good! Tons of flavors with every bite! I added an egg to make it a little creamy, which made it taste even better! Our waiter was very kind, answered any/all questions we had, and constantly checked in on us!   I'll def be back with my younger siblings as it'll be their first time, and I now know that Jinya won't disappoint!",

I usually get the spicy umami miso ramen with tofu or sometimes I will get the tonkatsu black. My two faves. Also, the appetizers are bomb. Jinya buns and takoyaki is always a must. I recently tried a new appetizer, crispy unagi with seasoned eggs. I recommend that. It also comes with fried soft tofu. Just eat it all together, it's so good.  It's a small restaurant and usually busy during dinner time and late night, but so worth the wait if it is busy. It's also open until 3am so it's a good place after getting dranks or if you're hungry in the early hours of the morning.  @jinya pls open up more locations in Las Vegas.",

Even though there were 3 or 4 single person spaces available they made me wait until larger parties were seated. I ordered the quinoa salad and that was unremarkable and not well tossed. I ordered the tonkatsu black with tofu instead of pork. The first bowl had pork in it and the tofu was ice cold. The second bowl was right but again the egg, tofu, Kikuragi mushrooms, and spinach I requested added were all cold. This never happens at the Atlanta location I go to and I go there a few times a month. Even worse I stepped away to go to the bathroom briefly (think a number 1) and they bussed my table while I was in the bathroom briefly. It was an extremely disappointing experience all around.",

    "text": "So I've eaten here on a number of occasions, and I can't say I hate nor can I say I love it.. but there are a number of reasons why this Ramen spot is getting a solid 3 stars from me.. food is good but not mind blowing, and it's kinda over priced in my honest opinion, servers here are hit or miss like they're either really nice and on top of it, or really spaced out and not all too together and there.   I come here mostly when friends want to eat here as a group or whatnot, and my boyfriend and I came here together once so he could try it out (he wasn't so much a fan) I think the inconsistency in their service is one of the main dampers to this place.. one time the server was coming around to a group of mine collecting plates and bowls that were finished and my friend next to me wasn't quite down with her ramen and instead of asking and waiting for a response, she asked, \"are you finished?\" while she basically grabbed the bowl but she grabbed it in a way that she placed her thumb in the inside rim of my friend's ramen bowl.. umm unsanitary and gross dude seriously.. ask and then wait before you go sticking your fingers in other people's ramen bowls.. geez lol   The ramen is solid good, but I always tend to get the chicken ramen and never really venture off to anything different unless its the appetizers options... but if i'm coming here for ramen, I always get the same ramen lol  I wanna definitely try their drive thru.. which to me is kinda mind blowing awesome that they even have a drive thru but I wonder how quick and efficient that is.. ramen in drive thru   but my boyfriend felt his broth was a bit too salty, but again a little over priced for less traditional ramen spot, wait on the weekends or rainy days are especially long and there's no real waiting area.   I do have to say the female's restroom is kick ass toilet seat! I'm assuming its from Japan, but it's definitely one of those high tech toilet/bidet combinations. but the seat is heated and it sanitizes the seat with a spray when the automatic sensor is activated to lift the seat cover. most high tech throne I've ever sat on. lol   They do have a small bar area to sit on.. only seats up to 4 guest at the bar. They have a large community table that seats about 25 people, then lining the establishments are booth sittings that fit either 2 - 6 guest depending on the booth.   They offer a lot of side add on items but each item add on is usually additional $1.00 if your ramen is $10.95 then you add poached egg, extra spinach, corn, etc etc you just added additional $3 making your Ramen $14.. idk to me it just comes out a little bit pricier than other spots I've been to.. the serving size is average; nothing large like a large bowl of pho, but its not small either. Tends to be usually be just right, but I'm a huge soup over noodles fan.. so I tend to always finish my soup first and still looking for more when I'm finishing the noodles.   Again the ambiance of the place if definitely more modern than traditional, but their menu is pretty straight to the point with not too much fusion options which makes choosing pretty simple. I do like that they have a half off certain appetizers Happy Hour 10p-12am, but I just don't like how if you order appetizers, your tapas tend to come out after the Ramen, especially if you order the Dynamite tapas. That one is actually really good and comes with 4 small toasted baguette slices to place the dynamite mixture on and its very tasty and not too creamy, like its not swimming in cream cheese which I like. but i prefer my appetizer as an appetizer before the main meal.. just saying.   Again, I have mixed feeling about this place like some days I'm into it and most I'm like ehh.. but really can't go wrong with Ramen in cold or rainy weather and this is relatively close to my house so nothing mind blowing here but solid good ramen, but not my top spot.",

    "text": "My experience at Jinya Ramen Bar was lackluster.  My friend and I came with empty stomachs and a big appetite.  So, we ordered enough food for a party of 4.    Cha Cha Cha for garlic lovers was suppose to be my chosen one.  Unfortunately, the thick broth had a weird garlic favor.  I love garlic, and Cha Cha Cha did not do it for me.  The ramen noodle was good.  The broth didn't complement the rest of the bowl.  I elected the pork chashu bowl to supplement.  I prefer the pork bowl at Monta Ramen.  My buddy had the tonkotsu ramen and it was good.  On par with every other ramen shop.  The appetizers we tried were the pork gyoza, jinya dynamite, and crispy chicken.  The crispy chicken was delicious! The jinya dynamite was heavy in mayo and it overwhelmed the dish.  If it was lighter on the mayo, the dish would've been tastier.",

The restaurant is of descent size, the staff are friendly and service is quick. We ordered our usual gyoza and also tried the jinya buns. They both were good :) The noodles--you can order them thick or thin. I had the tonkatsu and the kids had the miso. All were great. I recommend that you try this place if you are a True fan of good ramen and dashi. There are lots to choose from with add-ons as well. Enjoy!",

We called him them 30 mins later, they said that there is another 20-25 wait; so we came back at the 20min mark, they had probably called our name right before we showed up. The front desk hostess said that she is putting our name to the bottom of the list. Either estimate better or invest in the technology that texts people when their table is close to being ready or hosts with better customer service.  Update: decided to wait and two different customers walked in within the additional 20min wait, as the host moved us to the bottom of the line, and apparently the host called their names too so they were recommended  to go to the buttom of the line as well. Seems like a recurring problem.",

    "text": "I really do try to avoid leaving poor reviews, but my experience here warranted me to do so. Husband and I arrived around 11:15pm with about 8 parties ahead of us. We were given a wait time of 20-25 mins, no big deal. The big deal lies in the fact that, come 11:45pm, the two girls handling the front took their sweet time in seating patrons. I counted, there were about 12 available open seats, with a large waiting list, yet the staff didn't seem phased at all.  About 11:52pm, we were finally seated. Our waitress was probably the worst part of the experience. It was very apparent she didn't want to be working. She literally looked pissed. She dryly took our orders and hardly ever returned to check on us. I asked her for the red chili flakes, she said okay, only to ignore me and not fulfill the request.   By now, we just wanted to finish our food and leave. They blast house music, yet most of the staff really just look depressed and not happy to be working at all. The food itself is alright. I ordered the spicy chicken mild. It was indeed mild. I couldn't even taste any spiciness. My husband ordered the Jinya chicken. The broth had a heavy eggy flavor to it. I live in San Diego and am spoiled with ramen places like Tajima's. So, this particular ramen place didn't do much for me.   Back to our experience, we finish our food, and literally have to go out of way to flag our waitress for the check. When we do, we hand her our credit card, thinking she's just going to go and take care of the payment. Of course, we were wrong. We see her walking around the restaurant. After about 5 minutes, my husband is now just irritated with the whole experience so far, he goes to the front only to find the card just sitting on the front podium. The hostess didn't acknowledge it and hasn't even taken care of the bill! My husband had to tell her our waitress dropped this but apparently didn't give further instruction nor cared enough to follow up on it. Only then did the hostess check us out.   Overall, the food is mediocre, but the experience is in dire need of improvement. Management, either take care of your employees or instruct them not to kill your customers vibe! It's Vegas, there's hundreds of places to dine. I, for sure, will not return.",

This time, not only their service level plummeted, the quality of food also declined.  I've ordered my bowl of Spicy Chicken Ramen (their signature dish), but waited 40mins until I got my bowl.  And when I took my first bite, the broth was COLD.  How could you serve a cold bowl of ramen?  This has been by far the most disappointing visit ever.  From their first opening in Las Vegas I have paid many visits, sometimes twice a day because of their good food.  Have visited their Vancouver, BC location as well.  Now, not only their service level sucked, their food now also sucked.  I can say I will not be returning to this restaurant again.  Truly sad to see a great business got ruined by bad employees.",

    "text": "Wow. Came back here and HUGELY disappointed. JINYA has stopped serving high quality, traditional ramen and instead catered to the masses of non-Japanese people pouring in.  The food- 3 or 4 stars. The tapas are all really good. The tacos are great. The JINYA bun is very special- the bun is AMAZING. However, they switched out the special cucumber and sauce with a ton of lettuce and the beautiful, delicious pork belly was traded out with a tough, tiny pork belly. VERY disappointed. The JINYA  black is good, solid 4 stars, but there are a multitude of other ramen options nearby that are better.   Service- the wait time was VERY long. Crazy line. Luckily, for 5 people, we were able to sit at the bar. Come before 5 or be prepared to wait anywhere from 30 mins to over an hour. The waiters and staff were fine, pretty nice and standard. Almost none of them were Japanese (none of the cooks) which is a bad sign. It took 45 MINUTES FOR RAMEN. Ramen bars are supposed to be quick, simple restaurants serving authentic food, but instead a much longer, complicated menu takes forever. Also, they seemed to be only making to-go orders! If you're waiting more than 5-10 minutes for your ramen, that's not good. The Tonkotsu Black was good, the Miso Ramen was good, and the chicken buns were good.   Overall, it's time to pick a new Ramen place. Monta, on my opinion, is by far the best, although the wait is foreverrrrrrr. Ramen Tatsu is great and so is Ramen Sora. Just because everyone just found this place doesn't mean it's that good.",

    "text": "Instant ramen is the best-selling item at the Rikers prison commissary, outselling coffee, candy, and Coke.  You won't find instant ramen at Jinya Ramen Bar, but you will find a bunch of great options to eat. In fact, I'm tempted to give Jinya 5 stars for having so many really good items...but in the end I'm not sure that any one thing they do is my actual favorite. I love their Premium Tonkotsu White Ramen--a blend of pork & chicken broth with pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, seasoned egg, and a little fried onion. I always get it with their thick noodles, make it spicy and add some fresh garlic. The broth has such a lovely consistency and feel as it coats your mouth and invites you to lick your lips.  While the  Premium Tonkotsu White Ramen is my favorite, there are several other items that are better than the usual items you find at ramen shops, such as: Chicken Chashu Pork Bun Pork Gyoza  I also really liked the Tonkotsu Black Ramen. It is a more traditional pork broth and comes with garlic chips and garlic oil, both of which add a nice depth to the already flavorful broth.  I have also tried their Spicy Chicken and Vegetable Soup Ramens.  Both are good, but not what I'm typically looking for when I head to a ramen shop. Besides, Jinya specializes in Tonkotsu and Tokyo styles of ramen...so I'm not sure I see the merit in venturing away from what they do best.  The brussel sprouts are a miss for me. They are heavy and don't do anything good to promote tempura or brussel sprouts.  You can also get pretty carried away customizing your ramen in a lot of beautiful ways here, so take advantage of the opportunity...maybe add some greens to your diet!",

    "text": "Best ramen in Vegas!!!  This is my go to place when I'm craving ramen (which is pretty often!). I normally order take out but have dined in more than a few times. Everything I've ordered has been tasty but here are some stand outs:   - Spicy creamy vegan ramen: regardless of whether or not you eat meat, this is a MUST try. The broth is very savory and perfectly compliments the thick delicious noodles. Add a seasoned egg for a little extra creaminess and flavor   - spicy chicken ramen: perfect soup for a cold day or if you're under the weather. The broth is a little thicker than a traditional chicken soup with big pieces of tender chicken chasu and thin noodles.  - tonkotsu black: a more traditional style of ramen with pork, seasoned egg and other veggies in a flavorful, umami broth.   - Jinya buns- tender pork bao buns  - takoyaki: these octopus balls are flavorful and addictive. 1 order is perfect for two to share. ;-)  Tips:  - This is a popular spot and a pretty intimate dining area. That being said, coming during off peak hours or ordering take out during peak times are you're best bet. -  Order extra broth... it's really good!  - Just because a soup has the word spicy in its name, they will prepare it mild unless you indicate your preferred spice level. If you're not sure, ask for the hot sauce on the side so you can adjust it to your own taste.",

The kids meal was awesome and huge portioned. My two kids got to share ramen, fried chicken and rice, and a california roll. Plus almond pudding for dessert.  The family got tonkatsu ramen, veggie ramen, and spicy chicken ramen. The broth was very tasty, and had ample noodles. I loved that you could press fresh garlic into your broth at the table. We also ordered the brussel sprouts, which were good but I would've loved a dipping sauce.  The lychetinis were also legit. Loved that they were only $5 each. Wouldnt hesitate to eat here again.

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying I am a True ramen snob. I visit my parents who live in japan regularly so I am prone to judge Japanese food pretty harshly.  Food:  The broth at Jinya is great. I ordered the Chicken ramen, which is essentially a hearty shio ramen which is exactly what I was hoping for. I also tried the soup from the Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen, which had a strong flavor of katsuobushi (dried skipjack tuna) which made for a really nice, light taste for pork broth.   My gripe comes from the obvious lack of attention to the smaller details in creating the bowl which really took away from the great broth. The ramen itself came out lukewarm. The noodles and spinach were not drained properly which resulted in diluted soup. The noodles should have been slightly more al dente (although this is probably a preference thing).   The gyozas were good. The takoyaki came out cold in the middle.   Overall Jinya has all the flavors for a great ramen place. With just a few minor tweaks in details I think it could be SO much better.",

I really enjoy their tonkatsu spicy ramen with a combo of their salad and rice bowl (about $15 for all of it so not bad at all!). Although their spicy level is not as spicy as I want because apparently my taste buds has no feelings, this has to be my favorite spot for tonkatsu! Never fails to make my tummy happy. :)  Service here is always amazing. Never that long for them to refill waters and always someone to help when needed..  Ambiance is very fitting for the mood. Just a chill little spot with an awesome women's restroom! I mean obviously it doesn't take a lot to make me happy haha.",

    "text": "This place is a cute little ramen shop off the strip. The hot soup definitely hit the spot, especially for my bf who was still recovering from a hangover (and yes we came here for dinner). Lol. The actual building is a bit weird, looks like it used to be a small drive-thru place, but they obviously no longer utilize that drive-thru window and the entrance is on the side of the store facing the strip.  There was no wait for a party of 3, we opted to sit at the large communal table in the middle. The restaurant is fairly dim and quiet inside. I ordered the Jinya Tonkotsu Black, without kikurage (mushrooms) plus corn and extra seaweed (came with 3-4 pieces). The bowl was of decent size, even a little on the larger side which was a nice plus. The ramen noodles were good and the chashu meat was delicious and very tender. My meal also came with a good amount of corn. Yay. The egg was a bit more undercooked than I'm used to - even the white portion was gooey, but it's okay I just left it on the side. Our waitress, Roselle was very attentive and sweet. She even commented on the uneaten egg when she was clearing our table, but I explained I'm accustomed to the soft boiled eggs that come with ramen, I just didn't realize that theirs was so undercooked here. No harm, no foul though.   Great location off the strip for a yummy bowl of ramen, would like to return on our next Vegas trip.",

Happy hour specials are the way to go if you're dining on a budget. For $3 you can get a decent cut of pork belly covered in a sauce that balances sweet and tanginess in their Jinya bun.  On their regular menu the Jinya No.1 tonkotsu black ($10.55) is a medium-sized bowl filled with a creamy pork broth with just enough heat to clear the sinuses. They'll let you substitute thick noodles for the typical thin ones if you'l like. The single, large slice of pork in the bowl had enough fat to deliver a blast of savory-sweet flavor with each bite.  Service was friendly and informative. I also admire them for denying alcohol to a belligerent customer too drunk to make a coherent sentence. As long as it isn't me, I'm completely ok with that.",

I went in and there were a lot of people waiting. The dining room is pretty small. I asked how long the wait was but the hostess had no idea. I only get an hour lunch break so I had to leave. I am not sure if they take reservations, I think it is first come first serve, so be advised.    I decided to go back a few days later and luckily there was no wait. I sat at the big family sized table right in the middle of the restaurant. This table seats at least 20 people, so if you don't mind eating in front of strangers then you are good to go.  They do have a few smaller tables that border the large table, but they were all full.   Anyways I sat down and was given a menu. I already knew what I wanted, and that was the Tonkotsu Assari. It took a good 25 minutes to come out. When it finally came out I slurped myself into a ramen oblivion. It was very good and filling. Unfortunately this type of meal has loads and loads of sodium, so it is probably best to just have occasionally. It is tempting to go everyday when the weather is cold though! The service was good and the waitress was nice. Packaged ramen you can suck it! There is a new sheriff in town.  Yelp 2015 Review #6",

They are reasonably priced from 10-12$, and you also have the option of adding items to your ramen! My favorite dish is the wonton chicken soup, as well as the vegetarian soup! Both come with thin noodles and you can pick your range of spiciness. I prefer spicy, but if you are hesitant start with mild. Overall, I have never left here un-satisfied, the best ramen in town in my opinion!   The only downfall is there is sometimes a wait, but it is definitely worth it!",

    "text": "I like this place a lot.   The ramen isn't quite as good as Sora's, but they have a better selection of appetizers, drinks (both alcoholic and nonalcoholic), and larger variety of ramen.   For vegetarians, they have a vegetarian ramen, and for those who don't want pork, there's chicken ramen.   There's never a line, and they are going to add a drive-thru soon. Service is friendly and fast as well.  Lastly, they're open until 3am, making them the obvious choice for late night dinners.  Personal favorites: Takoyaki, Spicy Tonkatsu, Spicy Chicken Ramen, and Crispy Rice.",

I always order the same thing- the creamy vegetarian ramen (no spinach because I find it to clump together) besides that everything is perfect. The workers are very polite and attentive. The atmosphere is cool and \"hip\" especially when they dim the lighting. It's a great place to come with either a large group because of the large center table or for a date. Definitely worth the wait for a table. The wait is usually 10-15 minutes, but they do only seat you if your complete party has arrived!",

    "text": "Another Ramen spot added to the Vegas scene. One that heard lot of great things about and happy finally got to check out. I came here with some friends visiting from the 808. I was telling them about new Ramen spot in town. I had my worries cause back home Ramen is almost as common as Spam musubi. So pleasing the local boys would be tough. JINYA never missed a beat 808 style.  I remember years ago the building that JINYA in changed few times over the years. My last memories thinking was fast food chain. So walking into the restaurant was totally different world. I like the whole revamp look from the interior the lighting fixtures, the huge community table is different, still have your booths, also have small but tradition Ramen Bar area with bar stools (have your own private show of sorts watching the chefs at work), all the bowls Ramen serve in screams personality, the sake box of sorts that the tempura brussel sprouts served in, and even the outside clearly stands out. The fact that it opens till 3am...  JINYA not very big place but then again most Ramen spots here in Vegas not that big. So if you go when busy expect to wait or do like three of us did community table. We started with tow appetizers the JINYA bun and the Tempura Brussel Sprouts. The JINYA bun was ok. I was thinking more along the line of peking duck with oyster sauce in steamed bun. It amounted too was charsu in steamed bun. I needed sauce or something bring personality to the dish. The brussel sprouts that was amazing!! Honestly after having the brussel sprouts give regular traditional shrimp tempura bad name. The brussel sprouts was perfect nice al dente and hot inside. The tempura batter was perfect consistency not over heavy or light. It had the right amount of coating, flavor, and the truffle oil on top took it to another level. Appetizer that must in restaurant this is one highly recommend. Addicting we crushed it between three of us.   I went with the Tonkatsu Spicy. It had nice kick. I love the broth had so much depth and mention the kick again. If not enough they have different spicy condiments on the table. I love all the stuff that on top of the Ramen. You get nice size portion of noodles in the bowl. The bowl deceiving cause lip of the bowl not wide but deep bowl. I know had noodles till the end.   The menu has great diversity. Few more appetizers that looked (lot of the items have picture on the menu) good! The Ramen again diversity even have vegetarian one. One of the best things about the menu. They offer combinations with choice of appetizer plus ramen. The catch is can only go with the combinations they offer. Still something that can not think of other Ramen spots that offer it. Ramen and gyoza that must for me. I got the best of both worlds. The homemade gyoza was awesome. The combination gyoza you only get four pieces instead of regular order of six.   The service was excellent. She was on it the whole time.",

If you're running short on time, I wouldn't recommend this place because chances of them making a mistake in your order is 99%. I have visited this establishment several times, all ending with some kind of mistake in my order. I honestly would not come here if it wasn't for my mother. This visit was much faster in receiving the order but in many of my other visits it took over an hour or more just to order and get the food delivered to the table. On the bright side, they have a variety of different toppings compared to other ramen restaurants. On the down side, the toppings are $1 to $2 or more just for two pieces. Making your noodles spicy even costs $1 which is a bit ridiculous to just add a dab of sriracha. If you don't like smiling and angry looking waiters this is the place for you!",

My brother and I felt it was a good way to sample a few things since we've never been to a ramen bar before. Initially, we were a little puzzled with what actually came with the combo, but we were pleasantly surprised when we learned we didn't have to choose between ramen or the rice dish. We were given half orders of each, gyoza and almond tofu dessert. We chose Tonkotsu Spicy, Spicy Chicken ramen, and we each had the pork bowl.   Both broths were nicely developed and perfectly seasoned. However, I enjoyed the chewiness of the thick noddles in the Tonkotsu a bit more than the thinner version in the spicy chicken. I'm not a big fan of eggs in general, and the seasoned egg in the pork bowl did nothing to woo me. The pork though was succulent and rich with flavor. The gyozas were addictive and some of the best I had, I return for those alone. Dessert was light and refreshing, a nice end to a filling lunch.",

    "text": "Took my daughter here to see if there is another ramen place that is as good as Ramen Sora or Monta... This place did not disappoint.    I had the Jinya No. 1- Tonkatsu Black. The broth was hearty and flavorful. The noodles are thin, but I think I prefer it like this. The chashu is tender and the rest of the ingredients/toppings were complimentary to the ramen soup. It had nori, kikurage, seasoned egg (nitamago), garlic chips, fried crispy onion, green onion and a little dollop of red chili pepper sauce.  It was very good.   My daughter had the Tokyo Yatai ramen. It came with a chicken and pork clear broth, chicken, chashu, bamboo shoots green leafy veggies, fried onion and nitamago. She opted to not have the shredded red peppers.  She ate as much as she could. She rarely orders ramen and her saying that this was delicious was a big deal to me. She usually opts for a small bowl of just rice and chashu.   We ordered the gyoza and Takoyaki. Gyoza were on the small side (from what I am used to), but just delicious. Takoyaki on point. I haven't had really good Takoyaki in the states except from Shirokiya at the Ala Moana mall in Oahu and my time I was in Japan for vacation.   The Takoyaki was cooked well. It had good chunks of octopus and ginger in it. The sauce they put over it and Bonito flakes were not overpowering.   The service was good and attentive.  I will be back.",

The waitress helped us out w our Ramen decisions so we could enjoy a lighter Chicken version that was one of the chef specials and the more classic Pork version which is a greasy salt bomb, but in the best possible way!  Forcing ourselves to give up the challenge of slurping up each and every last noodle about 3/4th of the way through was the only way to avoid going into food coma so we could still enjoy the rest of our evening!

I've turned into quite the Ramen addict in the last two years and although I hate to admit it, I've acquired a taste for hipster Ramen vs traditional.  Although you won't catch me kicking any Ramen bowls out of my bed...  So back to the point of my taste in Ramen.  There is a place in San Diego that I LOVE called Underbelly.  Some people haven't been quite won over yet, but that does seem to be the place I use to compare all others.  Well except for the place in Paris, which will be my ALL TIME favorite.   There is a very good flavor to the broth, you can choose thick or thin noodles and you can add \"toppings\".  All of which is very important to me.  The price is very reasonable and the serving size is filling.  They also a happy hour so it's a win win in my book!",

    "text": "LOVE JINYA but if I'm ordering takeout it should be ready when I arrive. They told me it would be about 25 minutes and I arrived closer to 35-40 minutes. When I got in they told me about 5 minutes then they needed to pack everything up. I waited an additional 15 minutes before getting my food. Super disappointed that takeout here actually means nothing.   They also messed up my order. Maybe tonkotsu broth in la means something different than tonkotsu in Vegas. Just wanted to get home and eat my food but instead I spend 15 minutes waiting for my food and another 10 trying to sort out my order. Heavy sigh. I think I'll stick to the JINYA back home.",

    "text": "Great atmosphere, service and food!  The place is offers about eight tables and a large communal table that seats about a dozen.   I love their Cilantro Lime Ramen which you can substitute thick or skinny noodles.   The broth is clear with nice lime and chili flavors, not too spicy, just right!  For appetizers we selected their Truffle Oil Brussel Sprouts, which are good in flavor just a little heavy on the tempura batter.  Next we tried their Pork Chashu Bowl which I did not care for much and wish they had a little more seasoning or char.   They offer a good variety of appetizers, ramen and sushi.  Overall a great ramen place with a modern vibe! I would like to get around to try some of their other ramen specials but I can't get away from their Cilantro Lime Ramen goodness!",

Actually, the scene is getting too hot that some of the otherwise good joints have closed down and considering that, Jinya seems to have attracted a solid customer base.  My favorite so far is \"Tonkotsu Assari\", as mentioned by Philip T it is a basic, no cheat fare. Tonkotsu Black is also good and rich, but it can be too heavy when I'm not super hungry.  Jinya is also one of the closest, most accessible ramen spots from the strip when we have a visiting friend.  Overall, I'm very happy with their food and service.",

After frequenting Monta and Sora countless times, I decided to give Jinya a try.   Upon looking at the menu, I was enamored by the Jinya Pork Bun which was excellent. A friend in the party ordered gyoza and that was surprisingly good. (My expectations for gyoza are usually pretty low)    Next came the Spicy Chicken Ramen with HOT spice level. It was ok, nothing too special. Friend got the Tonkotsu Black which is more garlicky and rich and I think that would have been a bit more to my liking. 3 stars  Comparing all these ramen places is difficult, but I'd still rank Ramen Sora as my personal favorite. However, the side dishes (Pork Bun and Gyoza) were so delicious that I give it 4 stars.",

We ended up waiting about an hour and was wondering why people coming after us we're getting seated before us. We asked the hostess and she had rewrote my name as a completely different name on another paper, so that was why we waited so long. I was a little upset that she didn't apologize but she did get us seats quickly. After we sat down we waited another 10 minutes or so with no one coming to take a drink order or anything. Again, a little disappointing because we were all so thirsty from waiting outside. By the time we got in a ordered it had kind of slowed down already but our sides kept getting forgotten or something was missing so we had to keep calling for the server. I have been here a couple times feeling satisfied, but this experience was a bit disappointing all together. The restaurant was extremely cold (to the point that I was shivering), the ramen was luke-warm, and the service was not as good as before.",

    "text": "With 4* we decided to try this ramen spot out, but I was highly disappointed. There were only us and another group of people in line. The hostess asked if we wanted to sit in the center table, which is a communal table. We said no we wanted a booth, but not less than 10 min, she asked again if we wanted to sit at the center table. I honestly think she forgot that we requested a booth. Anyway once we were seated, our waiter told us about the menu, but the music was a bit too loud and we couldn't hear him too well.   We ordered gyoza because they ran out of the jinya buns that other Yelpers were raving about. Hubs ordered the pork chashu and he thought it lacked flavor. I had a taste of the pork and the first thing I noticed was that the temp wasn't hot enough, it was just warm. I waited more than 5-7 min before my ramen came out and having to wait that long got me a bit irked. I had the cha cha cha pork chashu ramen. I liked the thick wavy noodles, but the noodles were broken, not long like other ramen places. Another disappointment was that the broth was very thick and tasted very rich. I know I ordered the pork broth, but it just seemed fatty. I've had other pork broths at different locations and I've never had it this rich. I couldn't even finish it and my hubs didn't even want it. The positive thing was the seasoned egg and our nice waiter. I don't think I'll be frequenting this place anytime soon or again. We literally had to rush home just so I can drink some hot tea to wash it all away.",

    "text": "This place truly is a worthy \"rival\" to the famous Monta Ramen.   The only thing that makes this place slightly worse is their bowl is more expensive by a dollar or so. However, this place definitely has the flavor to match that of Monta. I ordered their spicy tonkotsu ramen with their flavored egg (which is a soft boiled egg) and I was very satisfied with what I got. Their broth is very rich and flavorful I didn't even need to season it at all. The only thing I found a bit weird was that the tonkotsu ramen was served with thick noodles rather than the traditional thin noodles (which they serve anyways.) I'll probably order the same thing with thin noodles next time.   Service was also great here, I'd say better than Monta. I came here with my large family which included a small child. My niece had the kid's meal which was a fried rice with fried chicken and also had a pudding dessert with a strawberry puree. The waitress noticed that my niece really enjoyed the strawberry and offered to give her some more. Our table was checked on frequently enough to feel hospitable but not too much that it was bothersome.  In my opinion, Jinya is a nicer restaurant where I would go on a date, where Monta is more touristy and casual. So depending on what you're in the mood for pick accordingly.",

Jinya makes a mean tonkotsu broth though, and it's been consistent enough that I don't mind skipping my usual ramen spot.  I'm not settling when I come to Jinya, I'm simply going with a different alternative.  When ordering a bowl of ramen, you also have an option of turning it into a combo meal.  Not the french fry and Coke variety, but the ramen and gyoza variety.  Or ramen and karaage.  Ramen and chicken chashu?  Ramen and pork chashu.  If you have an appetite for more than just soup, you can add on a salad and side dish of your choice for only $4 or $5 extra.  Outside of their delicious tonkotsu broth and combo meals, the other big reason I enjoy coming here isn't even food related; it's the fact that they have a bar!  I dine solo quite often, and every time I come here I've been able to grab a seat at the bar without waiting.  Food is consistent, and service is super friendly.  Two things that make it easy for me to be a fan of Jinya.",

By the time I got home, 20 minutes later, the broth was still warm. My mom likes her soup boiling, so I did reheat both of our broths (which they kindly separated) and poured it over our ramen noodles. We both ordered the same thing, Jinya Tonkotsu Black because we like thin noodles and altered it to our liking. My mom added bamboo shoots. I omitted the spice (I'm a whimp) and green onions and added tofu. The depth of flavor of the broth was spectacular. It was what you hope for when you order ramen: deep, rich, porky goodness. The noodles were the right texture. All the other accoutrements (seasoned egg, seaweed paper, pork chashu, kikurage, garlic chips; garlic oil) made the ramen a complete meal that was delicious. I also ordered takoyaki, fried octopus balls, which were yummy, especially with the sauce they are covered in. I was disappointed in the Jinya bun. The piece of pork chashu was very small in the soft, white bun. I will not order it again. Otherwise, I was really happy with my order. The next time I am craving ramen, I will come back to Jinya!",

The Ramen isn't that amazing in flavor but it's good enough when you're  craving ramen late at night. The server was very friendly. I forgot his name but I wish my boyfriend or I remembered! Yet, when we came here for our third time, it wasn't a good experience at all which made us not want to come back. The restaurant surprisingly wasn't completely full that night and the server (Ashley) took us to our seats. I ordered my Veggie Ramen and asked her if I could just have the veggies and no noodles... and she said no right away. When the last time I came (my second time ) they were able to do that and even the manager was the one who gave the thumbs up for this request. Also, when we finished ordering our food right away we asked if it was possible to move to the table on our right side next to us (we wanted to sit there because it was on the very corner and I feel much better like that because of my anxiety). Yet, Ashley said no, that she couldn't do that. That once she sits us down , \"she can't move us somewhere else.\" I felt very frustrated at how a server could be this rude and not give good hospitality. She is clueless about what it means to be a good server.",

I enjoyed having the option of thin or thick noodles, and as I prefer the thicky thick (noodles), I went with those. It was a good decision.  Chose the Tonkotsu Black ramen and the spiciness was just right, especially for this fella who cannot handle his spice well.   There are a number of items available to add-on, and if you add garlic they give you a press and you can press the garlic yourself. Pretty interactive.  I know the drive-thru may never open, but the fact that they even imagined the concept of a ramen drive-thru scores major points in my book. I'm up for the challenge if it ever does open!  Also, staying open until 3am is another bonus. I don't know about Vegas, but in Chicago I can only think of Strings in Chinatown that is open that late.  It's actually a little cheaper than places in Chicago so I wonder what the price points will be when they open one here.  In the meantime, I've found a place to fill my ramen cravings when in Vegas.  Feeling generous, so I'll drop a fiver on this joint.",

I'm a garlic fiend so that is a no brainer. It can get busy at times but it is never like monta, where you gotta wait a good hour before eating as if you're in California. Highly recommend!

    "text": "I've been visiting this Ramen Shop since they opened at this location at least 1x a week.  I love their Ramen.  Over the course of that time the price has gone up a couple of times, but I've dealt with it as the servers are all friendly, know my order right when I come in, and I'm happy when I finish!    The last menu change and price increase unfortunately has crossed the line for me.  They no longer offer Tonkatsu Assari (#3) in all its glory.  The closest thing to this is now something with brussel sprouts and extra pork.  I don't mind the extra pork and it's probably still a good price for what you get, but the latest price increase brings my regular order to close to 50% more than what it was when they first opened.  I could just change my order to accommodate their new menu, but with so many other Ramen shops around that offer a lower price bowl or Ramen that has everything I want in it (and nothing more that I have to pay for) it's hard to justify staying a regular here.  Makes me a little bit sad since it's SO close to my office and a great lunch option.  I asked the server if they could just keep giving me what I like to order.  They are able to do some substitutions and get it pretty much how I like it but the price remains higher.    Perhaps you can keep Tonkatsu Assari as it used to be as an \"off the menu\" option for regulars like myself.  You'll definitely win back my regular business and Yelp Stars!!!!  I would rate it lower for the menu change, but the food is still quite good so I can't go lower than this.",

We chose the bar since we were on a date and wanted some privacy. Loved it!! Tonkatsu Assari was delicious. Sake was delicious as well. Sitting at the bar was cozy and more personable with each other.  Second time we went we sat at the community table with our other friend. Fun, different atmosphere. Servers are very attentive and kind!   We're getting in take-out tonight! We found our spot!",

The spicy miso ramen is a little too sweet for my taste but most people would probably like it. It has a lot of flavor and definitely not salty like a lot of other ramen places. Although it's not as salty as other places, it packs more flavor. The pork gyoza was cooked to perfection. The ramen #1 black was very rich, but it balanced out the saltiness. There was black garlic oil that made the ramen soup rich but it wasn't overpowering it at all. It complimented the thin noodles. Definitely the ramen I will remember the most. The takoyaki was pretty average because everything else was phenomenal. The Chashu bowl was average because there was only a little amount of Chashu and it was cut into pieces. It would have tasted better is it was whole in my opinion.",

Coming from the Bay Area and after experiencing one of the worst meal at the Chef of the Century \"chain\" restaurant, I was very leery when we sat down and found out that Jinya is a chain.  We were greeted with a smile by the hostess and led to a nice table for 4 for the two of us. We sat for a little while examining their menu to decide what to eat. Our waitress came to ask if we were ready to order, but since we were deciding and taking pictures, we told her \"not yet\" and she left us alone without any attitude.  We ordered the following:  1. Jinya No.1 Tapas: Chashu pork bun, pretty juicy piece of pork on a Chinese style bun.   2. Jinya No. 1 Ramen: Tonkotsu Black, thin ramen noodle served with three slices of pork chashu, Kikurage, green onions, dried Nori (seaweed), seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil and fried onions in a pork broth. Very savory broth with just a hint of spice with just the right amount of accompliments, for slurping those perfectly done ramen noodles.  Taking into account of the service and ambiance, Jinya is really comparable to my favorite ramen house, Dojo, in the Bay Area.",

First of all, service was great - super friendly, super cute, no complaints. That being said, the food left much to be desired. I love raw salmon, but the salmon tacos were pretty basic and overall bland. It lacked a depth of flavor and was simply uninteresting and forgettable.  I sat at the end of the bar where there was a constant chill from either the hallway or front door, which I didn't mind because I was expecting a piping hot bowl of ramen. However, when I received the recommended \"Cha cha cha\" the broth was only lukewarm, the center of my egg was still cold, and although I appreciated the thicker cuts of chashu, the meat was also lacking in temperature to the point that the fat was still almost solid. I also had to dig through a mountain of bean sprouts just to get to my noodles - overkill. I may be nit picking on the sprouts, but after everything else... just saying.   The restaurant was far from full capacity at the time and still had a few hours left before closing time, so quality control should not have been an issue. I have NEVER left half a bowl of ramen uneaten before. Starting to think that the lines out the door are because this place is trendy and open late, and not because of the food. I departed supremely disappointed, and worst of all... still hungry.",

However, the service I received makes me want to rate this place -1 stars. My party and I were served by 2 servers on 1/29/18 by Alex, and a waitress with pink hair. Let me tell you that I have never received such horrible service anywhere. When Alex stopped by our table he just threw the drink menu at us, and didn't wait to take the drink order. He came by twenty minutes to take our food order, when he did, I handed him my menu and he didn't reach to grab it so it fell. I was going to grab it for him, but it was right at his feet and I couldn't reach. He acknowledged that I dropped the menu, but instead of grabbing it he left it there. That was the last time we saw him stop by the table, until later when we asked someone for his name. Our food was delivered by someone else, and then the pink-haired waitress came by to try and give us our check. One person in our party was not done eating, and we wanted to order dessert. So she loudly crumpled the check and took the order. The dessert didn't come, and the pink-haired waitress came by with the check again. When I told her the dessert was not there she said \"oh, no one brought it to you?\", she did not care to apologize. It was at that moment that my party and i decided to ask for the waiter's name that initially served us.   Basically, we never got refills, no one ever stopped by our table, they were trying to rush us out of the restaurant the entire time. The atmosphere of this place is 'get out, we need you to leave'. No one is attentive, and the place lacks organization. The food is great, but the service is enough to never go to this restaurant again.   The seating host was kind, however. That's a plus for the service team.",

    "text": "Jinya was due for a revisit. Still lacking lunch in the late afternoon, I chose to try their happy hour (3-5pm).  Upon arrival, I was promptly seated at the bar area and informed of happy hour (helpful for those who stumble in without prior awareness). I didn't need alcohol or veggies, so that eliminated most of the options. Having neglected to compare costs thoroughly beforehand, I ordered a Jinya bun ($3.00 HH, $3.80 regular) instead of the crispy chicken (5 pc, $3.00 vs. $5.80, a great deal). Luckily, the bun was very nice, with dough that wasn't too dry and tender pork that wasn't too sweet or anything of the sort. It's comparable to other pork burns that I've had.  For my main course, I chose the tonkotsu black ($10.80) this time instead of the tonkotsu assari. This one has thin noodles by default, and they seemed to be done properly this time. There are two fairly thin pieces of chashu (one with a dab of chili paste, which was odd since it's not in the photo or ingredient list), one more piece than the assari. The egg seemed fairly typical - not fully hard-boiled but not runny. A little black garlic oil, green onions, fried onions, kikurage, and two pieces of nori rounded out the bowl.  Like last time, I was confused by the broth. It did taste better than the assari broth, but it still seemed to be lacking. Halfway through, I tried adding a bit of the liquid from the bottle labeled \"ramen seasoning.\" The mixture of soy sauce, garlic, and other components does really round out the broth's flavor. It's almost mind-boggling that Jinya has this gimmick of basically forcing the customer to add liquid seasoning to get comparable flavors, a conceit that no other ramen restaurant that I've been to in any city has done.  At this price point for ramen, I still favor the deluxe miso at Ramen Sora at least 9 times out of 10. I think I would also prefer the kogashi ramen at Fukumimi if price and drive are eliminated as factors. However, I will say that the dessert (an option missing from other places) was a pleasant upsell at meal's end. The An-Nin Tofu ($2 HH, $3.50 normally) felt like a steal, with soft almond pudding, a little whipped cream and strawberry sauce, and fresh diced mango, kiwi and strawberries.  I still like Jinya in spite of my broth quibbles, but if it's not happy hour or late night, you'll probably only find me here again if I've overenjoyed my other local favorite ramen spots. And no, Monta is not one of them.",

    "text": "Cute little place near china town. The decor inside was very cute. The chairs had no cushion though so my butt was hurting after an hour of being there.   Ordered the Tonkotsu Black spicy level medium. Delicious! All the flavors mixed well together. My favorite part was the seaweed. The spiciness was just right. The beau got the Spicy Chicken spiciest level. That thing was so spicy but it really was delicious. I think I might just stick with Chicken broth. I liked the Tonkotsu but I think chicken broth tasted better than pork.   We also go the Jinya Bun. I didn't really care for it. The pork had a very dominate taste to it. Also go the Crispy chicken, which I also didn't really like either. Came out with a salad which I liked.  But I ordered Annin Tofu for dessert. This was by far the best thing about the meal! It's sweat almond pudding with kiwi, mangos and strawberries with whipped cream on top! I don't know who told Jinya that those were my 3 favorite fruits. Must get if you come here.   Overall, it was a good meal.",

The head chef came out and talked to me forever until we figured out how I could get my ramen fix without a trip to the hospital. So I ended up with the Pork Tonkatsu Black with Vegan broth. (Sesame and shellfish free) It was amazing.  I really appreciated his going the extra mile for me.  They also serve beer and have this super tasty crispy chicken appetizer.  The restaurant was popping for late lunch on a Thursday, but the food was worth the wait. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes.",

The pork is soft and melts in your mouth! To make things even tastier you can pick from thin or thick noddles. If your debating about going to JINYA ... DO IT! You will not regret it!

And Jinya does it right!  1st of all, 3-5PM is the Happy Hour Special and the prices are great, especially if you want to sample a few appetizers for only 2 bucks apiece!  The atmosphere is open, rustic, and comfortable. The music playing throughout our meal was outstanding. If you like The Paper Kites (look them up on iTunes), then you'll enjoy all the music. We did!  Service? Outstanding! Very friendly and helpful to make the right choices. And very accommodating when we needed 'to go' bags, bowls, etc.  The food? 10/10! The pork bun was tender and very flavorful. Yummy for the tummy.  We decided to share the Tonkotsu Black Ramen bowl, based on our waiter's suggestion. Again, a perfect choice and very flavorful!  Lastly, I can't wait to go back! The only downside was the location. Not in the best of neighborhoods and about a mile or so off the Strip. We walked from The Palms and it was okay. It is worth taking a cab though, because the food is great!",

The cauliflower appetizer is delectable! The sweet potato fries are delicious as well. Gyoza order is too much for one person, but still worth to order even if its just you. The ramen itself is quite tasty. I love the additional noddles for your left over broth! Usually, I have the spicy chicken, but have come to ADORE the vegan spicy ramen. WOW. Great flavored broth and thick noodles with plenty of options to add! I say you should eat here at least once. Make sure you have time to spare to be sat. Even if you are sat, sometimes they run out broth which again, adds to your wait time. Still worth it though!",

I sat at the bar and started off with some gyoza. I asked if is possible to get it steamed and my server said no. They only do pan seared. It amazes me because usually a place that offers gyoza knows that originally gyoza are meant to be served steamed. Before my gyoza came out I had ordered a spicy chicken ramen. I finished my gyoza and just sat there waiting for my ramen. After a good 25 minutes another server comes to me and asked if I got my ramen. I was so confused. I said no and she immediately went back to the kitchen and came back out with my ramen. I seemed that my ramen was forgot to be put in or the kitchen forgot about it. As I got my ramen it wasnt spicy at all! It was regular ramen and I added my own spice. My food took so long o forgot to take a picture of my ramen. This was my first time here and I wasnt impressed. I will definitely give it another try and see the outcome, probably tonight it was too busy for them.",

I've never had a chance to eat here and I finally got the opportunity. The place is small, loud, and there is no front seating area. Everyone just stands outside or stands, blocking the door. The hostess, Judy, obviously doesn't enjoy her job and that's very clear with her cold demeanor. If I could write two separate reviews, I would. 5 stars for the food, but a 2, if that, when it comes to the wait staff.  The seating sucks. There are maybe eight tables along the wall, and one big communal table in the middle of everything, and of course bar seating. If you want to knock elbows with the person sitting next to you, or worse, the awkward eye contact as you slurp your noodles, definitely sit at the communal table. The bar is cramped. After being seated, A gentleman walked over offered to get us drinks, and asked to take any orders or if we had any questions. I tried to order the gyoza, but unfortunately they were out. The only appetizer available was the edamame. When I had a question about the menu, the waitress gave a very snarky remark like I should've known the answer to that question. I was also not given any options about toppings. I had never been there and it was not a pleasant experience. After the food had come out, she checked on us once. I had to keep calling the waitress over to get drink refills. I'm just happy the opened the other location. The other location on Rainbow has much nicer staff, a quieter atmosphere, and looks very clean.",

Annoying thing is they have empty tables (booth and main large table) but they don't seat people.  Clearly the owner needs to hire an extra server if there are empty seats, long time waiting outside, but no one gets served.  It's too bad because the ramen is 5 stars but the wait time is terrible and turns it into a negative experience.  We brought friends with us and are feeling terrible for the overwhelmingly long wait when we could've eaten elsewhere and be on the way home by now.  The hostess that doubles up as cashier is completely clueless as to managing people flow.  A booth stayed clean and empty for over 20mins and she sat zero people there.  Eventually, when someone did get sat there, they were unhappy with why they weren't sat sooner when the table became available 20mins ago.  The hostess (long black straight hair eith bleached hairtips lied and said \"oh it just got cleaned a few minutes ago.\"  BS!  Everyone standing near the front knew she was lying and were grumbling about the same thing.  Bad wait aside, the food is great and the servers we've had were also excellent (except for the young woman with thick black rimmed eye glasses who took every opportunity to complain about customer.  This is the only ramen house with a vegan ramen and veggie ramen. All vegas broth ingredients atr imported from Japan..",

Jinya not only has the best flavor of ramen, but their noodles taste unlike any other. Their menu is extensive too and they offer a killer happy hour. AND they have craft beers. The music is great too. Definitely has a millennial vibe. I would come here on a date or just dinner by myself. This little restaurant is one room and it pumps out the best and most authentic meals In vegas. I hardly come across places I like and I can't wait to come again. Disclaimer: the line is long but so worth it. (I waited about 20 minutes and it was just me). Be patient with the hostess she is also the cashier for all the servers and takes all to go orders in person and over the phone.

The Brussels Sprouts are a creative addition to ramen (and totally welcome from me, because I am a weirdo that loves Brussels Sprouts). The broth was light and pretty good (not quite as flavorful as Monta, but it worked well with the other components of the ramen and I enjoyed it).  Overall, this is a good ramen spot!   Oh! I also got the Salmon Poke Tacos.. I didn't like the marinade that the poke was in, but these are a good deal for $4.   I am excited to try more from this place!",

The food on the other hand made up for how hangry I was. The salmon tacos are currently my favorite, add a hint of lemon and ugh, those are to die for. I got the JINYA chicken ramen and that's pretty good too, their broth is very flavorful and there's a lot you can choose from.

We arrived at 6:00 on a Wednesday night and were seated right away.  The server made helpful suggestions, and our ramen came out extremely quickly - perfect because we were in a rush.  I had the Tonkotsu Black and it was perfect!  The broth was very hearty and flavorful.  Additionally, you can add \"ramen seasoning,\" which is in a bottle on the table to make it even tastier!  It also comes with the infamous soft-boiled egg that was cooked to perfection.  The noodles were relatively thin for ramen and soft, but it was delicious.  The chashu pork was also great!  The price was also very reasonable.  I also ordered the Jinya Bun as an appetizer and it was delicious and a little fatty (which I love, but understand it is not everyone's favorite).  This is where the service was a little weird because they forgot to bring our appetizer before the ramen and after we mentioned it to the server, she still forgot to bring it out.  This was a tiny mistake that was overshadowed by the AMAZING RAMEN!!  I have been looking for outstanding ramen here in Las Vegas because it is so easy to make mediocre ramen.  I think I have found my place and I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE everyone to try out Jinya!",

Waiter was quick to order and it took forever to get my ramen 30 minutes. Place was half empty. There was a person from the health department doing a routine inspection and the kitchen is the size of a small closet so one extra nosy body in there was one too many. Slowed things down. Inspector made them throw away some eggs in the fridge that were not at the right temperature ( like 75 of them in a sauce/ marinade) but all else seemed cool   Ramen was good, a little bland and the extra noodles were too much. Plenty of noodles come with it. All in all a fun place with decent ramen. I'm not a ramen snob, it all tastes good to me so it's worth a trip unless you are a ramen snob. Then you should go write a post about being a ramen snob.",

I along with my party of 2 walked in with no sign in list available and as soon as another party of three came in a few minutes after , a sign in sheet was brought out and with the hostess watching they walked ahead of us and put their names on the list. Mind you, I'm not an unreasonable woman I understand sometimes that's how it goes but, then they took the party of 3 behind us to their table. Then proceeded to tell me and my party that that was the last call of the night and the waitress looked me in my eye and said I understand and saw what just happened and I'm sorry but it is what it is. I just don't understand how and establishment that has been a consistent and respectful regular of mine could allow such service.

The broth is deep, rich, and flavorful. Toppings are varied and fresh. My greatest praise of JINYA is that they have spicy ramen, and the broth is actually spicy! The chashu pork is thick but delicate with melt-in-your-mouth fat. Even their chicken bowls have chicken \"chashu\" that isn't that differentiated from the pork variety (meaning it's just as delicious even without the melt-in-your-mouth fat).  JINYA offers pretty awesome appetizers and tapas (takoyaki, anyone?). The karaage is always a necessary order as well. I have paid the price of a burnt tongue many times just to consume these succulent pieces of fried chicken. But, what's really killer is their brussels sprouts tempura. Although already a lover of those mini cabbages, the thin, crunchy, and slightly salted tempura version is even better. Wish each order came with more because they are addicting.  The atmosphere is amazing as well. The wood detailing, dark lighting, and posters of Ramen Life make it a pretty cool late night place to go to with friends. Not to mention the bathrooms have Japanese robot toilets. I almost gave JINYA four out of five stars, but those toilets...",

The quinoa salad was very tasty and would gladly get it again. The takoyaki was very delicious, probably the best I've had in Vegas honestly.  For ramen we both got the regular spicy one. We weren't expecting bean sprouts in our ramen and don't really like them but we shouldn't been attentive in the menu seeing it was on it. The broth was good but the noodles tasty pretty sturdy.

Service was great, played awesome current edm, young staff. The ramen was perfect, egg was perfectly cooked? And the noodles taste fresh. I will be sure to visit this place very time we go to Vegas.",

    "text": "JINYA specializes in tonkotsu flavored ramen which is based off a pork bone broth. I think JINYA does a fantastic job with their broth. It is creamy, rich and full of flavor. THey have several options for their broth, I went with a spicy tonkotsu broth with a spicy level of \"spicy\" which i assume is considered medium. The ramen was cooked firm the way I like it, it had pork slices, but more sliced than normal, eggs, green onions and some of the other regular stuff you'd expect in the ramen.   I honestly felt like I could have gotten away with the tonkotsu assari which had about the same things in my ramen minus being spicy. Reason being was they have a bunch of condiments to still make your broth spicy so you could save a couple of bucks.   JINYA also offers a ton of toppings, they also have some really fresh garlic you get to mash yourself. I was not a huge fan of their takoyaki, too much batter, not enough octopus imo. They also have fried brussel sprouts in truffle oil, tasted like any other tampura fried item, truffle oil does not elevate the taste.  Overall, I think this place is great for their tonkotsu ramen.",

I then finished my meal with a Ramon. The noodle used in the Ramon was not very good. The noodles were slightly undercooked and not that satisfying. When you go for a Ramon you expect to have a good noodle in the bowl. On the good side the flavor of the broth was very good and the egg was cooked perfectly. I'll give this place another try.",

The place always seems busy which means they serve great food inside. The check-in process seems very fair and even though it was a bit of a wait at the entrance on a Friday night the line seemed to go really fast. Me and my husband ordered black tonkotsu and spicy chicken ramen, everything was delicious and the prices seemed fair as well. They also have an amazing happy hour deals between 10 pm and midnight, where you can get 3 dollar appetizers, drinks and deserts. I will definitely be back!",

There is a larger table in the middle where different groups or individuals can come together. They also had some good music pumping, a little reggae as I recall.   I had the Tonkotsu Assari bowl. It was such a flavorful broth that I left some noodles behind while sipping the broth to its end. I also had the tempura Brussel sprouts. A bit salty for me but I definitely enjoyed them this way. Another star of the meal was the Jinya bun. pork belly on a steamed bun how could you go wrong. I will definitely be coming back to try the many different options Jinya Ramen Bar has to offer.",

Apparently starting tomorrow they open at 11:30am.  Or rather on the first.  Anyways, I was greated right away.  I was the only.person in there for awhile.  Granted I got there right when they open.  They apparently.have specials that last until a certain date.  Thats nice <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fto.know.in&s=b5df6e0e53df9a9913a2a0c5242e0b53b6bf0ca58b0151e4a9240b32751cb376\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">to.know.in</a> case you LOVE the special you know they will have it until a certain time.    I had the tonkonsu ramen black, gyoza, salad, and the squid balls.  The salad came out first.  It was mixed greens with some dressing.  A typical salad.  The squid balls came out next.  It was good and filling!! It was 6 pieces...with lots of sauce.  I never had anything like this before so I cant say it was the best, but awesome choice.  The squid was hot but I found it to be cakey with some bites.  Still good just texture.  Gyoza came next.  Nothing spectacular.  Then the ramen.  By this time I was getting full.  The both is nice.  I like the chasu and the egg.  The noodles...meh it was aldente.  I like my noodles soggy or a little but softer.  But it was good tasting.  Just not what I was excpeting.  It was the thinner kind...im thinking maybe I need to try the thick noodles before I Truely render my verdict about this place.   Overall good customer service.  The waiter filled.up my water...and was attentive.  The food was good but I didnt like the way my noodle was...perhaps I needed a pork chicken broth but based on what I had it was good but not spectacular.  I guess I prefer monta...",

She immediately seated us in a table in the corner, half booth half table really.   I was very pleased with the seating arrangement if I do say so myself. The floor plan is open, the place is not big. The walls are lined with booths or tables and in the center there is a large wooden table with seating for a group of about 20.  The lighting is low, so it gives a sense of privacy despite the open room. The music is mostly tasteful indie dance and its just loud enough to drown out the conversation of others but not too loud that you can't hear your own.    Our server was a young girl who explained the menu to us and checked on us at all the appropriate times. We ordered curry rice and the octopus balls which were both AMAZING and I would/will come back for more!   I will be a tad hit of a stickler here and say the ramen was not as aesthetically pleasing as at Monta and I don't truly care for the thicker style ramen noodles but the broth was very good and had a nice full flavor. The service was great and our server was attentive and friendly without being intrusive. Overall a very nice experience. And they're open late!",

The cha cha cha ramen is 'for garlic lovers'. I love garlic. So much. And although I thought there was garlic flavour in the actual ramen bowl, our server had given me a garlic press and a small container with fresh garlic. Totally fine with that.  The ramen was very flavourful and the broth was fantastic. It was well seasoned and the pork chashu was very tender. I loved the chewiness of the thick noodles.  My friend's spicy chicken ramen was the right amount of spicy for her, she liked it a lot. It was only her second time having ramen and this was definitely a good example of what a bowl of ramen should be.   Our server was friendly and the ramen was great. I will definitely be back soon to try out more things on the menu!",

Jinya, however, is up to par with the better ramen places I've tried out of Vegas. Every time I go here I am sat instantly. Longest I've waited was 5 minutes. They also sell combos where you get a bowl of ramen and an appetizer.  If the wait times were an hour I'd still eat here. It surprises me that some ramen spots here have a one hour wait when the better ramen spot can get you seated almost instantly.",

We went at 1:30 and it was still very crowded, needs to wait but not a long wait. The vibe inside is really nice, although it looks like everyone was just on a date rather than filling up.  We were sooo hungry and really went for FOOD (laughcry) my boyfriend and I ordered 2 combo, mine comes with a curry rice. THE CURRY IS REAL GOOD. best curry I have in this half year in the states.  Noodles portion was nice too, filled up real satisfied :) and they offered real ramen, I mean, closer to what we can get in japan. And the broth, I'll give it 4/5, it's tasty, but of course, with MSG. But still fine... all ramen places in the US are like that.  What I appreciate most is the CHAR SIU!!!!! The PORK comes with the ramen!!! You really should go trying that!!! 5/5!!! (I'll even give 10 out of 5!!!!!) That soft and they did it really well!!  Overall would be 4.5/5... just because of the MSG, No ramen place in states could ever get 5/5...  Already missing this place when coming back in CA...",

We ordered the shrimp balls and tempura brussle sprouts appetizers. The shrimp balls were very tasty. The Brussel sprouts were okay, I wish they came with a dipping sauce as they were kinda missing something.  I ordered the spicy chicken ramen, with flavored egg. It was delicious. I would have to say it was the best ramen I have ever had. I ordered it the hottest it comes, and it only made my eyes run but it wasn't too hot for me.   My fiance ordered the pork cha cha cha, she enjoyed it, she didn't finish because the portions was a bit much for her. The broth seemed a bit thicker, but still delicious.  This is a very good ramen stop. Thr hard wood benches were a bit uncomfortable. I did notice a drive thru but I'm not entirely sure if it's functional. I would recommend trying this place out!",

For a while I *thought* this was my favorite ramen bar, but I realize now that it was only because of the atmosphere - it's super alluring in here. Something about the filament bulb lighting and the massive community table that could have you sitting next to Drake or Beyonce on any random night. Or perhaps the clean 'Less Than Zero' -esque bathrooms being textbook designs for impulsive restaurant bathroom sex and doing lines of cocaine off of the black lacquer Toto toilet tank lid. Imagine that!  Reality check, though. The food here is just not at the same level of umami as say, Ramen Sora (another LV ramen spot down the street). The kitchen food at Jinya just isn't that great. So crazy how the ambience at Jinya helps make every bite you taste seem like the most delicious version of that bite you've ever tasted. And that is worth something, but don't be tricked. Don't let the ambiance drug get 'cha.  For sure a great first-date place. The lighting will make you look like Zac Efron to your Tinder-mate. It's a sexy spot. Just don't eat too much 'cause your big performance later in the evening may be into the toilet at your Tinder-mate's apartment.",

Music is extremely loud (you can't even hear each other talk), the air conditioning vents made the food cold fast. The last time I went, their credit card machine went down.   The server was nice, apologized & asked if it was ok for us to wait until it came back up but the hostess returned & forced two people out of our group to go to ATM's to pay for our food so that other people can sit in our booths. The machine went back up after 5 minutes but by then the two people out of my group already had left. The hostess didn't even apologize. Such a huge inconvenience!

We hop off the 15 and get to this place in a decrepit strip mall.  It had a line and we find out it's a 1.5 hour wait which I was thinking it was fine since the ramen must be pretty good if there's a lot of people waiting.  Boy was I wrong.  I guess locals in Vegas don't know what good ramen is since the don't have the privilege of eating True ramen in places like little Tokyo and San Francisco.  Every bite of my soup was like eating flavorless lard.  Jesus Christ I could get the oily residue off my lips for hours after.  The meat was awful and the noodles were bad too.  Everything was really expensive also.  The beer was pricey for Vegas standards.  Service was pretty good since they had to deal with a lot of people.",

I have seen this restaurant so many times and figured it was a fast food restaurant because there is a drive thru. When we arrived I was very surprised! There was a twenty minute wait that went by fast but there was nowhere to sit or an actual lobby area. Everyone was standing awkwardly around but the service was fast once you sat down. It was happy hour we ordered two draft sapporos for 3 dollars a piece. Score! Started immediately with seaweed salad, spicy chicken and a pork bun. All of it was amazing! I recommend every single item! The servers use tablets which makes everything go by super fast I would say within 15 minutes we had our drinks our appetizers and our entrees. I got the spicy wonton and my boyfriend ordered the orginal ramen. We loved both. I ordered it spicy but still added some of the hot sauce they offer in it. I can't wait to come back to this place to try out other things as well!",

    "text": "I'm going to give Jinya a 4 because there's nothing wrong with the food... In fact it's pretty good... but at this point it's gonna take a lot to blow me away with ramen.   We've tried going to Jinya a few times but always turn away when we see the lines out the door (at all hours). However, I now know this is misleading because we got seated right away and the place is huge compared to the other ramen spots. Jinya is definitely \"trendier\" than the other places as well, with younger, hipper servers. We sat at the bar which was a tight squeeze and ordered a couple draft Sapporos, Jinya buns, and tempura brussels sprouts to start. All of the above was great and I appreciate the diversity and creativity of their appetizer menu.   Now we all have a ramen type that we can't help but gravitate towards when going to a new ramen restaurant. For me it's anything SPICY. Sure spicy isn't a flavor profile but I like my ramen spicy, okay? Unfortunately Jinya doesn't offer all of their ramens spicy, they have a few labeled as spicy and I chose the Tonkotsu Spicy and my boyfriend had the Umami Spicy Miso. Given all the new and different types of ramen Jinya offers I shouldn't have gone with something so boring but I did and it was... boring. And not spicy. The miso though was quite good, with a deep peppery taste that was unlike anything I've ever had in a ramen. The ground pork was also great and reminded me of a tan tan men more than a miso ramen. I like that Jinya offers \"unusual\" toppings like garlic and bamboo shoot. I guess I should have branched out a bit more with something like cilantro or sukiyaki ramen because it looks like that's what helps Jinya stand out. I can't say if these variations are gimmicks or if they actually elevate the ramen experience but I guess that's for another time. For now it'll be hard to pry me away from my spicy ramen at Tatsu and Sora now that I've officially tried all the top ramen shops in Vegas.",

    "text": "Looking for somewhere to get your ramen fix on a late night? Jinya's got you!! My normal go-to is Sora, but since my sis & I wanted it after midnight, Jinya was our best shot. For just us two, we waited for 20 mins to get seated. When we got there, there 10 parties ahead of us so I thought this was not a bad wait at all.  We got the Sprouting Up Ramen & the JINYA Tonkotsu Black. The sprouting up ramen had waaay too much brussel sprouts IMO, but the broth and noddles were still very good. My sis enjoyed the tonkotsu. It's got a little bit of spice but not too much - just perfect amount for those of us that can't handle the spice. And finally... we got the Tokyo Curry Rice & a Crispy Chicken and omg... this has got to be one of the best Japanese curry I've ever had!!! I didn't have much expectations since this is primarily a ramen house but I wanted to try their curry too, and I'm so glad I did. It is so flavorful, the texture is perfect (not too runny or too chunky), and the rice to curry ratio was good. Paired with the crispy chicken, we devoured this in just a few minutes before we got our ramen. YUM YUM YUMMMMM.  For a busy night, I thought the service was superb. I can tell that management definitely cares about training employees to be efficient & customer-oriented. Our server checked in on us frequently & we didn't have to wait too long for our food when we got seated. I'd definitely come back and try some other new items on this new menu! The only reason I took off a star is because I thought the noddle consistency could've been better. It was a bit too chewy but still acceptable.",

I am no expert, but I from all the ramen my friends ordered, there wasn't a single disappointment and they all had unique and strong flavors.  A local friend recommended it and there was a line outside the door before it even opened so I assume it is popular with the locals.  Within minutes of opening it was full.  Ramen was super flavorful, they give you options of different noodles, and a whole lot of additions you can make like adding eggs, various other meats, and more.  I would say if you like ramen this is a solid choice.",

I get the chicken ramen and let me tell you, I never leave without emptying my bowl. The portions are so filling and it's such a great comfort food.   I love the setup as well. Theres private seating but also some open dining seating so be prepared to possibly sit next to others. No one bothers you though, they're too busy sipping good soup!

The music they play creates an awesome ambiance. The restaurant is very small, but they didn't cram tables so close together so you can really enjoy your experience & meal. The lights are dimmed and they use really cool lamps to just add to the vibe. Perfect for a date!;)  I have tried their edamame, veggie ramen bowl, spicy chicken ramen bowl and the salad that comes with their combo. The spicy chicken bowl was my absolute favorite! I got mild and it added a little flavor, but I definitely could have gotten medium spice for a little kick. I also added cilantro and it made the bowl taste AMAZING!   The staff are all so nice as well. I really enjoyed my time there, not only because of the food, but the restaurant itself. Must try!",

The bursts of flavor was unlike any other ramen we've ever had.  The noodles were thick and springy, just the way they should be.  The broth is thick and fatty, just the way it should be.  The black oil Tonkotsu ramen was also delicious in nearly dimension but it came with 80% overcooked thin noodles and 20% thick noodles.    Insist on thick noodles if you visit, and expect a 30 minute wait during peak hours.  Our waitress was clearly not suited at her job and didn't smile once or follow up with our order after it became 5 minutes late and our neighbors who came in after us were half way done. Avoid her if you can.",

    "text": "First let's start by saying I'm a Monta fan. I came here seeing it was a new ramen joint, it's definitely spacious inside with a nice ambience. The staff and service was great. The bathroom was clean although they do not have paper towels as an option only air dryer. We got here around 8 and only 1/3 of the restaurant was filled.   I ordered a Tokyo tonkotsu ramen combination with their crispy chicken (3 pieces) and side salad while my girlfriend got a Tokyo tonkotsu ramen as well, both with thin noodles. I added corn for $1 while my girlfriend added chicken dumplings (2 pieces) $2. The side salad was mediocre, if I'd known I woulda just skipped the combination and just got a 5 piece crispy chicken for an extra $1. The crispy chicken was better than most places that I've tried. Now if you think Monta's tonkotsu ramen is salty then this place's broth might be for you as it is not as heavy/thick as Monta's. The chashu was more lean not much flavor, I like a fatty chashu like Monta's. There were not many options on adding your own spice, however the fresh garlic was a nice touch. The thin noodles were different from Monta's but still good.  Over all this has got to be my second favorite ramen place in Vegas, I will probably come back and try a different type of ramen, maybe their spicy chicken.",

Having consumed the Tokyo special which includes the standards by which to judge ramen: tonkatsu pork and pork broth, i think better is a consideration.  I found the pork broth to be heavy and filling in the best way. Creamy umami permeates the entire bowl and delivers satisfaction with the perfect amount of salty-ness. Speaking of perfect, i have to mention the temperature of the dish which was, perfect. The only thing worse than cold ramen is losing taste buds right out of the gate!  Add to this slightly aldente noodles and flaky, delightfully seasoned pork and you have a serious contender for Vegas' best ramen. I can't wait to return for more of the small yet exciting menu.  Do be advised that this is a ramen bar so expect a bar-esque music volume, not really my bag thus the four stars but it won't stop me from a return visit.",

Another member of our party ordered the tempura Brussels sprouts. They were light and crispy all at the same time.  The ramen was very tasty and not too salty like other places.

My service was ok and nothing stellar as I'm guessing dinner time can get crazy on a weekend.  As far as broth, I found it way too oily and the noodles seemed to thick (which is a personal preference). Because the broth was so oily, you really couldn't taste the freshness of the broth or the meat base of it due to the overpowering flavors.   I'm a proponent of if you have good broth, why over flavor it with other things...your broth should speak for itself and addins I feel are a way to compensate for ok broth.",

    "text": "Surprisingly a very good ramen spot off the strip of Vegas. Located in an unassuming location next to Taco Bell. There were plenty of parking on a Thursday night but we had to wait approx 30 minutes for a group of 3 around 8pm. We arrived after they called us and they sat us in a big community table. It was big enough that we had enough space between us and other people. Limited seating inside, only a few booths and a huge community table.   I tried the Jinya Tonkotsu black, the others in my group had the Sprouting Up Ramen and Tonkotsu spicy. I thought the flavors of my broth tasted much better than the other 2; probably because of the black garlic oil. My noodles were much thinner and was able to soak up the flavors quickly. The noodles were so good! The Sprouting Up ramen had tons of bean sprouts. Before our meal we tried the cripsy chicken as appetizer which came with about 5 pieces. The waiter provided a separate hot sauce which was really spicy. A few drops and your mouth would easily burn; loved it!   Service was attentive and great. We got our foods within less than 10 minutes of ordering. This is definitely comparable to the best ramens we've had in the Bay Area. Would love to come back!",

Service was very good and server was very friendly. Food was very fresh and tasty! The ramen portion does not seem like it's going to fill you up but....... I was stuffed! Very happy and fed will be coming back!",

The rest of the crew was friendly and smiled everytime we interacted. But our server just had a sassy vibe toward the middle of our meal.   The food was ok. It wasnt amazing, and it wasnt terrible. It was - ok. It was filling, but I wasnt hard pressed to devour it like I normally would.   I started this review giving them 2 stars but the personalities of the other workers boosted them to a third star. Not to mention, they had to deal with a large and loud group and still kept their charm.   Try it, see if it's for you... we will gladly drive past next time around. Sorry !",

    "text": "Came here after a long night for a much needed warm lunch. There used to be a JINYA in San Diego but it's no longer there - whenever we come to Vegas we tend to always at least visit once.  After finally waking up and getting on our feet to get some food in our stomachs, we got to JINYA around 4pm, which is a pretty odd time - this meant no waiting in line, but I do see that they have the Yelp Waitlist option for busier times of the day.  I was tempted to get something from their Happy Hour list, but I was too tired out that I could only think about getting some Ramen into me.  My favorite dish to get is the Spicy Umami Miso Ramen - I fell in love with this flavor the first time I got it in SD, and was devastated when I found out JINYA would no longer be easily accessible. The broth is really nice and smooth; I might be biased because I do love Miso soup/flavored things. JINYA's noodles are always so bounce-y, which is why I always opt for their thicker noodles because it makes it even more so. Not sure if it's my bad memory, but I do feel like I used to get more toppings - I don't know if they changed their menu or not because it's been a while since my last visit.  There was a slight hiccup while we were paying as a server mixed up our table's orders with another, but it was fixed somewhat fast. Still had to wait a couple minutes before they took back my card which I was confused about since they knew I was ready from the initial payment, they could've just waited for me to take my card back out.",

    "text": "TLDR; great ramen place that has a thick soup base.   This is my absolute favorite ramen shop. They used to have one location in San Diego but now the closest one is in Vegas so I always try to come at least once when I'm in the area.   There's a live waitlist through Yelp so we were able to easily gauge what time to leave before it started getting busy. We went a little after the usual lunch hours on Saturday and there wasn't a wait at all.   I ordered the Jinya Tonkotsu Black and made it a combo with a pork chasu bowl. The group also split an order of Takoyaki.   Takoyaki: each order comes with 6 pieces sitting on a bed of egg salad. It's super easy to share this since they stick each ball with a wooden skewer. Can't say if it was the same for all the pieces since I only ate one but I got a good chunk of octopus in my takoyaki. Would recommend this as an appetizer to share!  Pork chasu bowl: the bowl was just alright. The meat pieces were really flavorful but it wasn't as fatty as I would've liked. I've eaten at other restaurants where the meat were also slightly charred and I think that tastes a lot better.   Jinya Tonkotsu Black: my favorite ramen! The bowl itself already comes with garlic oil and garlic chips but I asked for more fresh garlic to add to my bowl. The soup base was nice and thick, rich with all the pork fat. I wish the noodles were a little thicker but it was still good.   If you want good ramen, this is the place to go. I recommend it to everyone and it never disappoints me. I've never tried their other ramens before but I'd imagine they're all also very good.",

My boyfriend had the sprouting up ramen and also noted the noodles' delectable texture. Highly recommend!!  For appetizers we recommend ordering the JINYA pork belly bun and the salmon poke taco. Both were melt-in-your-mouth delicious.",

Food: Dad ordered a chicken ramen and he said he liked my creamy vegan ramen better in terms of broth. That's saying something. The vegan ramen here is to die for! Since the spice has fish oil I used the hot sauce on the counter and it was so good. Not a fan of the Hollywood hot sauce but the paste was perfect with the ramen. It was also the perfect amount of food. We got tempura brussel sprouts as well with edamame and they were both done well!   Service: I love the fact that the waiter checks in so often to see if we're doing okay cause parents needed spoons and forks and something of the sort every time. The entire staff says bye to you and its super cute.   Pricing: Total for 3 ramens and apps came out to about $50, totally worth the price considering it's Vegas.  Amazing ramen experience! Try the creamy vegan you won't regret it!",

No. That space in my heart is saved for silver lake ramen. But this will hit every ramen craving spot. I always order the spicy tonkotsu with a ramen seasoned  egg. The egg is cooked to perfection. Complete with the Ooey gooey yolk middle that so many ramen joints get wrong. The soup is always piping hot,  the broth is packed with flavor. The noodles are chewy not sure if they are hand made.   I always order the chicken karage or simply put fried chicken. It's yums as is most everything fried. There's a small salad and dipping sauce on the side to accompany the karage.   Service is fast . Food comes out quick. JINYA is a solid ramen place. I believe in Vegas they have a couple of locations as well as in California.",

I ordered onsen tamago(soft boiled eggs), but I don't think I will order those again(they were kind of runny), but I will order regular hard boiled eggs next time. They have a la cartel toppings you can order for your ramen as well. Atmosphere was kind of trendy and the they played good music.

I tried the Tonkostu Black and it was delicious. We got it to go, so can't speak of the servers but the hostess was great, sat us down while we waited and even offered water. May get an extra egg next time....soaks up that broth!!",

Our server may have been high I'm assuming because she greeted us with \"Wassssuuuup\" and spoke very slowly.  But anyways food came out slow and out of order,  Ramen before appetizers, side order curry rice halfway into meal (isn't the curry already made?) and we weren't even done with our food and instead of refilling our empty glasses she asks if we wanted more water.  Hello, we ordered spicy ramen!  The problem was not only they knew their service was slow (they apologized for each dish they brought out slowly), but they continued to be slow.  We waited 25 minutes to get our check.  And the girl at the front of house who's also the cashier didn't know which table to bring my change to.  She can't even do her job right.  I feel bad for whoevers waiting to be seated because the wait wouldn't be that long if they had their ish together. They get 2 stars because the ramen tastes good but there are many in the area with much better service.",

I highly recommend this place. It's the perfect assortment of fine quality food...no overkill...just right.",

I had the spicy chicken Ramen, the meat was tender and flavorful, and I enjoyed all the elements of the dish. I love that they have combination meals, because let's face it, sometimes noodles are not enough. But with the addition of the gyoza and salad that came with my noodle combination, I left very happy and full! I can't wait to try out their other menu items!",

They are also open late until 3am which is also super clutch.  The food here is also super bomb! My personal favorite is the Tonkatsu white or the spicy. The broth is super well spiced and incredibly filling. They also have a pretty good happy hour and appetizers. Cheap bear and squid balls for the win! They also have a vegan ramen that I have never tried but all my vegan friends sing its praises.  The fact that they have a Vegan option is a good sign In my books since I have quite a good amount of Vegan friends. They also have a drive thru that I've never used because I'm not a fan of on the go ramen.   The only downside is that this place is a little small and depending on when you go the lines can get crazy long. Also the women's bathroom is super awesomely decorated, but as of my last visit the men's was just a normal one.   Overall, you definitely should come here if you're needing ramen in vegas",

I was very embarrassed and disappointed during our dining experience because I was telling my girlfriend how good it is. We ordered  Gyoza and asked for a small spoon to stir the Gyoza sauce and was told by our waiter Gino to use our chopsticks instead. First of all, it is unsanitary to use our own chopsticks to stir the sauce container that everyone uses.  After we said that we don't want to do that he said he thought we have not used it.  Its concerning that cleanliness is not a priority for our server.  This is a reflection to the establishment and must be addressed  immediately.   #foodie #foodenthusiast",

I ordered Cha Cha Cha which is for garlic lovers with a chashu bowl and salad and I ordered Tonkatsu Spicy for my boyfriend. The employee who answered the phone asked for my name and number and when I arrived to pickup she had actually called my cell phone. I wasn't expecting that and I don't think any other restaurant has ever done that, but that was actually really nice and convenient to know that they call you when your orders ready.   My bowl tasted so good! It was full of flavor and boy am I a garlic lover! Deeelicious! I thought the soup was lacking quantity because it wasn't covering the noodles and pork chashu completely and I tend to like my soup really.. well soupy!   The chashu pork bowl was good as well and it was just the right size. Not so much to make you full but enough that you'll want more. Salad was ok, I can't put my finger on what the dressing is made from. The Tonkatsu bowl was really good a little kick to it.   All in all really good food. I'll be back! It's a plus that it's right down the street from my boyfriends' place.",

Ordered the chicken broth ramen ,it's served in a huge bowl or Togo bowl which is what we got. Ordered  some  pork pot stickers as well all came out to 30$ not too shabby. Will def go back. They also offer different levels of heat we got the hottest one and it still wasn't hot enough at least to my fiance and I. If you get the mild it'll probably need some extra seasoning . Anyway,I think it's worth it . Also if you go to this particular location,make a reservation because you may wait about 20/30 min",

Parking was no issue since I arrived before the noon hour. Inside the decor was chic and hip looking with a large island bar located in the middle and surrounded by tables along the walls.  I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen black which contained a large seasoned egg, pork chashu, seaweed and green onion. The broth was tasty and flavorful. Service was solid. I had room for the green tea mochi which is large enough for two but ate the whole dessert. A great way to end lunch.  Overall for being a franchise chain I was impressed with the decor, food and staff here and would return in the future.",

Good. Perhaps the flavor profile was set more for Westerners? I was searching for a teeny weeny detection of a sort of smoky sea flavor. Which is not really discernible, but still exists, in the best tonkatsu broths. Missing complexity I suppose. I wouldn't recommend for ramen fiends like us, but I would for everyone else. Must give them full credit for good service.",

It took over 30 minutes for us to receive our food. Since we were on our lunch break it ended up costing us the dine-in experience and we had to ask for our food to go.   That is the sole reason for the 2 star review. The food is great. I got the spicy chicken ramen at the HOT spice level and the flavors were on point. I eat fire so it wasn't too hot for me. What surprised me was that I didn't think I'd like the spinach but it was wonderful! The edamame was plain, steamed, hardly any salt. I should have put some garlic on it.   Next time I come I'm going to make sure I have nothing but time. However, this will never be somewhere I stop for lunch again.",

But 2 waitress and 1 waiter did not care to seat all customers to these empty seats!!!   Now,  we have been waiting for 20 mins with other 8 customers now. There were now 6 available seats in the middle table plus 1 table just left.   We were leaving at 3.45pm! There were 6 ppl in line and there were still 5 available seats in the middle and 1 empty table, and 4 opened seats at the bar in the restaurant.  I know food is good that why customers like me are coming back. But if writer/es don't care to seat customers who waiting in cold weather hungry in emthy restaurant, not sure it is call good service!!!  Does the owner them to run the restaurant like this?",

Also they have non-ramen options to accompany the ramen, or to eat as tapas.  Reasonably priced.  Very efficient staff. It was busy and they moved people through there quickly without making the guests feel rushed, and while remaining very polite. Cute, modern set up.  Very small but unlike most ramen \"hole in the wall\" spots around town, they made good use of the space. Very clean.  Fancy toilets with heated seat covers and high tech hand dryers in the bathroom(s).  We had 2 dif types of ramen (with different toppings and thickness of noodles), gyoza, and chashu bowl with salad. Everything was delicious and we will try other things next time just because the experience was so great and many other options looked yummy as well...Oh, and I love that there is a ramen house open past 11:30 pm!!",

The reason I would say it does is because of the Black Tonkotsu ramen. The broth has such a deep deep flavor of pork and is so very rich. Makes me drool just thinking about it. If you don't enjoy the porky flavor as much then I recommend the Jinya chicken ramen. Its half chicken and half pork broth. The chicken broth really lightens the porky flavor but also compliments it. Skinny noodles were good, similar to Monta. Other item I tried were the fried brussel sprouts. Didn't think I would enjoy it but I guess anything fried tastes good. Other than that, service was fast, efficient, and friendly. Definitely found my new ramen spot!",

    "text": "Hubby, brother and I hit up Jinya on our latest trip to Vegas.  We got there a few minutes before opening so were seated promptly when they finally opened for business.  The menu and taste was reminiscent of Ippudo (of NY and Japan fame).  They had the pork belly bun which was actually pretty tasty.  We also ordered the tempura Brussels sprouts that was highly recommended - those didn't disappoint.  And since I'm a sucker for fresh tofu, we ordered the homemade tofu, done tableside.  What a gimmick.  But ya know...? The tofu was actually really great!  If you let it sit, it becomes silky, like the Chinese sweet tofu custard dessert.  They give you a sauce and the usual ginger, green onion and added a touch of yuzu kosho (which I love).  They also instruct you to stir it up which I wasn't a huge fan of doing but in the end, it turned out fine.  You were just eating like a porridge made with tofu.  In terms of noodles, brother and I ordered the tonkotsu black.  He added corn.  I got it \"as is\".  When our orders came, mine had a small dollop of spicy in the middle and corn while his was missing the egg that comes with the tonkotsu black.  We had to show him a picture of our noodles (we're food picture takers) but he still looked at my egg suspiciously, as if we were trying to steal an extra egg.  The taste was ok...it didn't blow me away....it just didn't have the richness of Month's broth or the complexity that other places had.  The noodles were nice and hard and the eggs were just on the verge on being overcooked (still miles better than those places that give up and cook it all the way.).    Hubby ordered the tonkotsu assari which, was promised, was lighter.  I think he regretted that choice.    My combo chasu bowl was a little underflavored and dry.  Not enough sauce in the rice to season it.  The combo chicken karaage was good though they serve it to you in giant pieces.  Definitely not a bad option if you want to go through the drive through or if you don't want to wait it out at Monta.  But not our first choice for ramen in Vegas.",

I am well aware of their seating nightmare here so after waiting 45 minutes last time and giving up and leaving, this time I thought I'd call and see if they do reservations first. Girl on the phone says no and it's a 30 minute wait. So I drive down to jinya to put my name down for a group of 3. I happened to leave a phone number since you want me to stand outside in ONE HUNDRED EFFING DEGREES FOR THIRTY MINUTES IN A SWEATER BECAUSE YOUR AC GAME IS WHACK!!! (Which everyone is aware of, as everyone waiting for this place brings sweaters, but that's another problem for another day) anyways. This girl now tells me \"we don't do phone calls and texts\" she tells me she will step outside and call my name at the most. Really?? Really jinya? Is that how \"good\" you guys have become?? You won't get buzzers like a normal restaurant then you expect people to sweat their ass off waiting outside because they have no choice, because if they dare step away from the immediate outside area they will miss their turn if they don't hear you call them? Wtf??? Get it TOGETHER. Newsflash! You are not all that. Poorly run restaurant and poor employee training and management. Apparently they don't need the business so they don't care how they treat people. Stupid af.",

    "text": "My go-to for to-go!  Especially if there's a wait, and there usually is.  It's also really good to eat onsite... even though the seats aren't that comfortable.   My favorite ramen is the Jinya White, which is a mix of their Pork and Chicken broth. With the two flavors, it's not too porky and the chicken adds a clearness which gives a cleaner style broth.   Thick noodle is better than thin, in my opinion.   Order Spicy and get the Hot level; it's good.   They make a good egg, so I usually add an extra.   Pork chashu is not the best I've had but it's still good.   If you're onsite, ask for fresh garlic. It adds a special kick, but it is something you and your party should partake in, or the odd one out will be the vampire target. Or get punished by garlic essence.   I also really like the combination meal where you can order a side dish. My favorites are their housemade gyoza or chicken chashu bowl. If I'm not that hungry, I ask the server to pack up the bowl so I can have for lunch the next day.   I did not like the Brussel Sprouts - it's not light tempura style at all and had too much batter.   Pork Bun - It's a good version and I would order again.   All in all, my new favorite ramen spot in town. Lots of versions and variety for all to enjoy.",

    "text": "I arrived for lunch around 1:30 pm on a Monday.  To my surprise it was still quite busy, but I didn't have to wait to be seated.  I always like to sit at the bar so I could see what they are cooking, but I couldn't see what they were cooking at this place because there was a stack of bowls in the way.  I ordered one of their more popular ramen combos ~ tonkotsu black and 3 pieces of karaage with salad ($10.55 + $3.95).  I think it was a bit on the pricey side.  To my surprise the waitress didn't even know what karaage was.  It didn't take long for my order to arrive.  Judging from the reviews of this place, I was expecting a good bowl of ramen.  But to my disappointment, there was a thick layer of garlic oil on top and the noodles were overcooked and soggy.  On the other hand, the broth was good, pretty concentrated broth.  Also, I wasn't expecting any chili paste in my ramen, but it came with a spoonful of chili paste right on top of my chashu.  If I wanted a bowl of spicy ramen I would have ordered it spicy.  They should have indicated on their menu that this is spicy.  I wasn't too please with this.  And for the price of over $10 a bowl of ramen, I think they should be able to at least cut the hanjuku egg in half and make the bowl look more presentable.  The karaage was equally disappointing as the chicken was not fresh.  It actually was on the verge of going bad.  All in all, I won't try these two dishes again, but might go back and try some other menu items.",

Great broth, char sui, boiled egg, bok choy and a few other toppings.  Fried chicken app and gyoza were great too.  Mochi ice cream and almond jello?  Yum.

A lot of chicken ramen dishes which I was surpised about. I ordered the Jinyu black ramen. Good flavor soup, firm noodles, and plenty of toppings. The sprouts were good but I was really impressed with the takoyaki. Very nice flavor, good balance of filling and batter. It was placed on top of an egg salad mixture which made the dish. The service was attentive especially considering how busy it was. The facilities were clean. Probably not the place to bring a large group but great spot to try.",

    "text": "JINYA's one ramen bar that offers much more than others in town. It's complete with a menu presenting more than 10 different kinds of ramen, plus a variety of appetizers and small plates.   FOOD  Appetizer - Taoyaki: We started off with one order of the takoyaki. The bread was soft and the octopus was a little chewy, but not so much that it was inedible.   Ramen - JINYA Tonkostu Black:  The broth was garlicky from the garlic oil, and the fried onions actually go well with the other ingredients. Though the broth was decent, I was expecting a richer, meaty flavor. Thin noodles were a pleasant change from the thicker variety. A downside about my ramen was the globs of fat from the pork chashu.   Ramen - Spicy Miso Ramen (Special of the Day): This was what my boyfriend ordered. The broth was mild and not as spicy as expected. It doesn't come with a marinated egg. To me that's like serving a burger without the fries.   RESTAURANT I was concerned that we'd have to wait for a table to open up, but 4PM on a Saturday afternoon was mellow with only several diners. Hip and contemporary, the restaurant is accommodating and has plenty of seating available.  SERVICE Dinner went off without a hitch. Service is in top shape here.  OVERALL Not bad, and I would return to try other their other ramen. JINYA's a good option if you're looking for variety. Rating: 3.5.",

    "text": "Yes, this place is open late. Is hip but is it really worth it? If you asked me this question 3 years ago, I would say definitely yes but over the past couple of years...this place has gone way down in quality and service. Yes, you can customize your order but is it really customized to your liking if they get it wrong? ALL THE TIME!! Let's not even talk about the wait time. I can never understand why even when there's plenty of space available, they don't seat the guests littering the tiny area by the entrance and the hallway to the bathroom--blocking guests from escaping should there be a fire or an \"emergency\" type incident? Is that even ok fire code wise??? Well, I suppose you can answer the \"seating\" question by watching the kitchen staff flounder their way around the kitchen. OMG so disorganized! No wonder they have to filter people from coming in and being served?! FAIL! You order a kid's meal and it comes out 20 minutes after the adult's meal. Hmmm...who should we serve first? Kids or adults?! And then get the kids order wrong?! Seriously?! For those of you non-parents reading this, this might sound petty but parents reading this will understand why this situation is a MAJOR SUCK!  AVOID!  As good as this place is, it's not worth the aggravation.  How hard is it to pick the right noodles to put in the bowl, thick or thin? They're spelled differently! If you can't differentiate, then don't make it an option! Good Grief! I literally have not had a visit (over the past 3 years) where they simply just got the orders right ...and we don't even customize our orders much! All we do is add toppings! LOL - crying inside! Sad to say this but I'm afraid this is my final visit to this place...I am so disappointed that I am actually writing my first Yelp review. Congrats guys!",

The interior design recalls Japanese influences with an modern and industrial feel. In the center of the restaurant is a huge wooden sharing table with cool light fixtures hanging above them. Smaller tables line the walls and windows.  Our server was informative of the menu pointing out that the pictures on the menu were their popular items.   I got the tonkatsu and my roomie had the spicy chicken ramen. Now, a lot of people claim that this place is better than Monta. I won't agree to that but I will say that quality and taste of the ramen is good in it's own way and is on the same level as Monta. That's just my honest opinion. The broth is a little lighter but still full of amazing flavors.  I definitely recommend this place to everyone who is a ramen lover or just curious to try a new restaurant. I'll be back to try more of their ramen options.",

We were a party of 7 and, as a person who works in the food industry myself, I understand how stressful and messy dinner rush can be so we were all ready to wait. But that's no excuse for the atrocious treatment of my part. Party after party was let in before us. Smaller parties of 1 to 3 were passable but parties of 5? Of 6? If the hostess had waited a few more minutes before letting those parties pass, there would have been enough room for us. But it seemed that the greater concern was the number of people they got in as opposed to who got in first. Considering we had already waited an hour at this point and the great things we've heard we were willing to wait. But then the hostess proceeds to /dismiss/ us when we attempt to negotiate a seating arrangement in which we would split.  Although the food was honestly fantastic (hence the two stars), and the servers were incredibly nice, I'm sorry Jinya, I won't be a returning guest. Get a better hostess/plan for seating.",

I had the shrimp balls and the spicy chicken ramen (just the right amount of spicy), both were delicious and full of flavor.

If there was a negative star I would pick it!!!f First let's start with music way too loud that your server can't  even hear over the music then they  forgot my aunt's salad but no biggie but for you as a server to have an excuse that you \"you didn't realize\" is ridiculous. First thing after food is dropped at your table is to ask if anyone needs anything or if everything is OK. Strike one, then the food seems to be taking extra long way after we finish our appetizers finally our server come to tell us that the noodle cooker is down and it will be a bit longer after what feels like forever our food is brought out  My sister who is new to being vegan order the vegan Ramen and  took a bite before the server came back to ask if she was vegan and if so they put in the noodles made with egg cause they could not make the vegan noodles due to the cooker being down wth!??!! My sister order the vegan Ramen for them to service non-vegen noodles strike two and lastly but not least ask I was bringing to enjoy my Ramen I found a piece of plastic strike three I could have choked and all we got was an insincere apology. I did not pay for a thing and walked out. Never again will I eat here!!! Needless to say there was a tacobell next store and the service was very good",

When she was finally done talking, she made it seem like her tickets were a priority and didn't even acknowledge nor greet us. Another star deducted, which I hope won't happen the next time we visit, is that our server (who was very enthusiastic and super friendly) was not attentive to us as soon as he brought our food. We didn't see him after that. We got the check from the busperson and even that took a while because there was only one server and one busperson.  Other than that, the food is awesome! I ordered the Takoyaki and Cha Cha Cha (with tofu and nori seaweed, which was put on a separate plate). I'm a huge fan of takoyaki and it's hard to find a place that has it but I'm glad I found this spot! I'll be ordering this every time I visit. The cha cha cha was really good as well but I don't know why I expected the tofu to be cooked like Agedashi tofu. The broth was super, the thick ramen noodles were super, and the portions are pretty generous.  My fiance ordered the Pork Chashu Bowl and Salmon Tacos. He obviously liked it since he wiped his bowl and plate clean. Overall, this place is a great late-night option and I'm willing to try this place out again especially since I love the Takoyaki here.",

I understand they are always pretty busy, but they always seem to be short handed. I don't like going to restaurants, and having to flag down the wait staff just to get a refill on water. And then on top of having to flag someone down, certain servers make you feel as if they're doing you a massive favor by refilling your water, or getting something you asked for. So some of the best ramen you'll eat, but terrible wait staff and customer service.",

Got seated with a group of 5 in just a few mins. The waiter was great and made a few suggestions. We ordered some pitchers of beer and then just chatted while we waited for the good stuff.  Service was on point, and the beer kept flowing. Had a few appetizers and then our ramen came. It was AWESOME. The best ramen I have ever had. I could have eaten 3 bowls of it and would have come back again and again, but it was my last night in Vegas. I need one of these closer to home!",

Waitresses usually take forever to get my check and when I'm dining with friends they often fill their glasses of water and ignore mine, even if theirs is full and mine is empty. Can't help but take it personally since it's happened many times. Not sure why since I tipped well in the past but the ramens still good so I come still I just don't tip anymore after that became a regular thing I experienced there.",

But when we came back to this place a few days ago after a while, the place  really changed. Some of the servers were super unhappy and seemed almost as if they weren't pleased with anyone or ANYTHING. It bothered me and my family due to the fact their displeased looked gave a sense of unwelcoming attention.   Not to mention, the kids menu was already delicious the way it was, but for some reason, they changed the fries and it doesn't taste very good anymore. JINYA was honestly the best, but the vibe and taste of the restaurant no longer catches my appeals the way it used to.",

I am in total agreement with my friends, Clint and Philip T reviews, this place has that winning combination of Good Ramen and Excellent Service. I would think of them as independtly owned, and was surprised to find out they were a chain.   The appetizers, which I can't spell right, were generous in portion, good in quality, and a fair price.   Though we had to send one of our Ramen bowls back, to have them change the noodles, they were very good quality, generous portions, and we were satisfied. My son, who was stationed in the Navy in Japan, is a Ramen snob, and he likes it. What does that tell you?  For sure, this place is joining the line up, of places in our regular rotation. Go there hungry, and enjoy quality at very fair prices.",

Their spicy chicken ramen is my favorite and I like how they give you an option to choose what level of spiciness you want. I even love ordering togo since they arrange the noodles & toppings separate from the broth so it can be heated at home, that way the noodles aren't soggy. The packaging and design of this location is also very modern. It's become really popular lately so whether you're dining in or ordering togo don't forget to plan ahead.",

Price is reasonable. About $10 for a huge ramen bowl. Service is great and the ambiance is nice and somewhat dim and moody. Oh and major bonus points for their bathroom and their amazing Japanese toilets that have seat warmers and other fun functions!  I love how this location isn't too far from the strip. So if you want to get out of the Strip for a bite to eat, this is your place. Totally worth coming here for lunch or dinner!",

    "text": "Not as good as Studio City and LA locations.  It's a solid place to go if you are new to ramen, generally par for the course for those who are a little bit more experience, the place excells in the areas concerning quality of the ingredients and the customer service.  House staff is always checking in and keeping things going, making sure needs are address.  What drops off is the technique and execution of the product.  Everybody at the table got ramen so we had a chance to compare and contrast, it was consistent from the spicy miso to the tonkotsu, all 4 versions of ramen on our visit had soup that was not seasoned well and a little bit low on temp.  Ramen soup is important, in a well prepared bowl, the soup is hot and flavors are jumping; the soup we had was closer to warm then hot and missing depth of taste.  Another example of missing the point, was the gyoza.  We can smell the dumplings frying up in the dining room and thought it was a good sign, but when it arrived the first impression was a little underwhelming.  There was a nice fragrant smell of garlic, cabbage, and onion coming from the pan fried gyoza, so what was missing was noticeable upon biting into the dumpling; it was lacking a sweet porky taste due to the ratio of meat to veg & aromatic.  Also, the filling could use a little more soy sauce, white pepper and sesame oil.  Visually, it didn't have the consistency that is normally expected from a Japanese restaurant.   Gyozas should have a deep tan color on the bottom of each dumpling but ours fluctuated from lightly crisp to almost white; which is a let down because part of a good gyoza is the flavorful fried bottoms.  And, to be extra picky, the dumplings were not facing the same direction, another touch that is expected from Japanese pan fried dumplings.  I can say that price and the reputation from it's original roots make it hard for me to recommend this location, but you can do worst.  If Jinya was a fusion restaurant I could give this place 4 stars (due mostly to the customer service), since the concept of the brand is about bring True Japanese flavors to the US, the 3 stars I offered up is pretty generous since what we got was missing the authentic taste of a good bowl of ramen and tasty gyoza.  If what we had was indicative of the rest of the menu; I couldn't see needing to come to this spot since there are other ramen joints within 10 minutes of this restaurant.",

The tako inside was almost nonexistent. Also, the takoyaki sat on egg salad which I thought was kind of weird. My friend and I ordered the chef special which had shrimp flavored broth and cilantro. There was SO much cilantro in the ramen it overpowered everything else.   If you're from Hawaii like me and expecting agu ramen or goma tei quality, don't expect it. It's nowhere close.",

    "text": "This ramen place deserves a five star review. Their food is consistently delicious and service is very fast.    I've always dined in at dinner time and I would always encounter a wait. The wait list is organized and they sit us pretty quickly. I think the longest I've ever waited was 30-40 mins on a Saturday night. I'd say it is well worth the wait though.   I really like the Tonkutsu Black and the regular tonkutsu ramen noodles. Thin noodles all the way for me. I've never had their thick noodles so I don't really know what it's like. Their mini tacos are good too; salmon and tuna. Definitely try their pork belly bun as an appetizer! You won't regret it!   Recommended A++++",

Basically their tonkotsu broth needs significant work but they're known for their chicken ramen. It's creamy and strong, with all the right flavors. Highly recommend this place but only for its chicken ramen.",

Firstly, you know this place leaves something to be desired when you arrive fairly early to beat the rush and the line is already out the door. The ambiance is really cozy and it must be said that the restroom was very clean. We ordered Jinya Buns, Sprouting Up Ramen, Jinya Chicken Ramen, and Spicy Umami Miso Ramen with Gyoza. The ingredients used were very fresh and our meals arrived hot and delicious. Their menu had a variety of appetizing dishes and I cannot wait to savor more of what they have to offer. I highly recommend this ramen bar for those who want to try ramen for the first time and for those wanting to satisfy their ramen craving. We will most certainly be back soon.",

My husband and I got on a bus and started on our way.  The place is small but intimate. The staff is welcoming and helpful with suggestions. They're honest about flavors.  Anyway... I ordered the takoyaki.... holy smokes! The flavors were balanced and each ball was a good size, I could get two bites out of each, and I take big bites.  I also ordered the salmon poke taco.... FML! I wanted to slap someone it was so delicious.  Then, I also ordered the creamy shrimp..... it was fried nicely and the sauces were not overpowering the flavor of the shrimp. They aren't heavy handed in sauces, which is wonderful.  Then...(I'm a fat kid, so there will be a lot of \"then\" ) I ordered the Cowboy, which had a fall apart piece of meat, egg, and a bunch of happiness in a bowl. The ramen... eff word!! It was al dente and delicious. I had spilled some on the table, you better bet your ass that I picked that up from the table and ate it. Then, I ordered another thing of noodles. My husband got a rice bowl. I don't know what he got because I was chewing a lot and didn't pay it any mind. Laughing out loud. For dessert, we ordered the panna cotta. I am most definitely going back.  I can't be as descriptive as I want to be because we have already flown back home and I don't have access to any at the moment.",

The ramen and food are still great, which is the only reason I have it at 3-stars. Everything else has deteriorated.  The ambience inside has changed. They now play loud club-like music making a conversation with the person next to you very difficult. They always have a long wait, around plus 45 minutes, good for them, not good for you. Because of this, I started doing pick-up orders, but they consistently mess up the orders and their phone lines are commonly disconnected for hours at a time.   Their pick-up times have increased as well, 10 minutes to a 50 minutes wait to pick-up your order. One time I waited an hour to get my order, and they left me waiting at the front register for another 15 minutes.  Their service used to be amazing. It's not the worst now, but definitely less than amazing. You won't be disappointed, unless you are talking to the host, the long waits, poor line management and the phone service is lacking there.",

The hubs and I had the chicken wonton ramen.  The broth was like a creamy chicken soup.  It tasted SO good! I remember when we were kids there was a cup o noodles creamy chicken soup. This reminded me of that only better!  We also had some edamame that was a perfect start to our meal.  The service was a bit off though. While we arrived early, we stood at the front door for maybe 10 minutes. No big deal. What got me was the female employee who eventually came over and unlocked the door and walked away.  She literally saw us, unlocked the door and walked away. She didn't open the door. We weren't sure if we should walk in or not.  It took 35 min to get our ramen once we ordered. I can only assume this is because they had just opened. Regardless of this, the food was great.",

    "text": "Been wanting to try this ramen place since I heard that it's quite popular in Canada and their instagram page is pretty!   Walking in, the fragrance of pork broth filled up the whole restaurant and I'm so impressed and surprised! It definitely attracted me. The overall ambience is really modern and cool, which I really like.  I was debating whether to get the Tonkotsu Black, Cha Cha Cha or Sprouting Up ramen. But eventually I chose the sprouting up one just because I've had tonkatsu black everywhere, just thought I should try something new and unique!   The ramen is topped with lightly fried Brussels sprouts. It was very unique since it adds on a crispy texture. However, I don't think it was fried to order because it tasted stale.......the broth is a mix of pork and chicken broth but I didn't really taste the chicken in the broth and it was really salty for me.",

    "text": "The ramen here is awesome! I put my name on the waitlist through Yelp, and even though I arrived after our group had been called, they were still  able to seat us right away. I opted to try the creamy spicy vegan ramen ($13) with a seasoned egg ($1.50). I thought the prices were pretty reasonable, although they charge for all the extra options, ranging from $1-$2.50. The ramen was absolutely delicious. Sometimes vegan broths are a bit plain, but this one was super flavorful. The main problem I had with it was that it had a lot of spicy oil that all floated to the top, even after trying to mix it together. So the first few spoonfuls of soup were incredibly spicy and the rest wasn't spicy at all. All the toppings and noodles in the ramen were amazing. Very good combination, and I would definitely come try it again on future Vegas trips.",

    "text": "Came here after a tiring day in Vegas and it was packed. We put our names on the Yelp waitlist through their tablet and there were 14 parties ahead of us. It took about an hour for us to get seated, so be prepared to wait!  I ordered the spicy umami miso ramen with an egg. The soup was very creamy and had chili oil in it. I thought it could have been spicier, but it was still really good. The noodles were super thick, which I absolutely loved. They held on to the flavor of the broth very well and were perfectly chewy. The egg was also hardboiled just right, but would have been better if it was cut in half. This dish also came with ground pork but it was too salty for my taste.  My boyfriend got the spicy tonkotsu ramen which was also very delicious. The noodles were also thick and chewy. We also ordered bamboo to go with our ramens and it was freshly cut - tastes so different (and better) than the usual shoots that come with ramen. My boyfriend said the chashu was average. The only downside of his ramen was that there was very little broth. Sad cause the broth was so good.  For sides/appetizers, we got the pork gyoza and pork chashu kimchee tacos. The gyozas were nicely pan fried, nothing to swoon over, but still delicious. The pork chashu kimchee tacos consisted of slow braised pork chashu and kimchee in a fried wonton shell topped with cilantro and lime. The shell was super crunchy and the pork was really flavorful (but a tad salty). I didn't really taste the kimchee though.  Overall, the ramen here was really good! Definitely recommend and would come back, but only if you have the patience to wait.",

The salmon tacos are very crunchy And refreshing to the taste.  The Ramen flavorful with every bite but the ailing they give you could fill 1 and a half! I and my friends could not finish our bowls and we felt so bad to waste such yumminess!   The pork is a must have at this establishment bc every bite comes out so tender and delicious! The pork is the topping to choose!! But if you love ramen eggs this place has the best ramen egg that I have ever tried!",

    "text": "Came here on a Saturday afternoon for some recovery food after a long night out. They have yelp waitlist, which I always appreciate since it allows you to plan ahead to reduce your wait time. Once our group of 5 arrived, we were seated about 15 minutes later. As far as the seating goes, they have one large communal table in the middle, and a few smaller tables/booths on the side.  For an appetizer, I ordered the takoyaki. It was delicious, and for only $5.80 for 6 pieces, I highly recommend getting this as an appetizer to share! I shared this with one other person, but you could probably get by sharing it among 3 people.  For my entree I ordered the JINYA Ramen Black, and made it a combo with the pork chashu bowl and salad. I found the salad dressing to be slightly too salty but not so salty that I couldn't finish it. The ramen was decent but I wish the noodles were slightly thicker (they do mention on the menu that this dish is served with thin noodles though). Don't forget to ask for extra garlic since it's free! I didn't eat much of the pork chashu bowl since I was so full after eating the ramen and 3 takoyakis. I did try a piece of the meat though before packing it away in my takeout box, and based on that small taste I thought it was really good! I ended up eating my leftovers cold the next day since our hotel didn't have a microwave, so I can't really speak to how the rest of the bowl was, as the rice had hardened in the fridge.  I'd definitely be down to come back whenever I'm in Vegas in the future. It looks like they also have some locations in LA, so maybe I'll try out those places sometime soon too when I'm craving ramen.",

Judy our server was on point, We ordered gyoza for our appetizer and a fun fact: the most ordered I believe was around 50, it's my duty to beat that FYI.   My main course I ordered spicy miso ramen adding a hard boiled egg and corn, this was a first and it was delicious!   Side note: the hot sauce is super spicy so start small and work you way up it's for sensitive pallets but if used correct it taste really good!

Either they changed or I changed.   I came back recently with some of my friends for dinner. They had wanted ramen and Jinya was a favorite. I rolled along since I haven't had Jinya in a very long time.   There was a wait. It seems that this place is always pretty popular and there is almost always a wait. We were originally going to be sitting at the large shared table but we asked for a change when we saw a table of four leave.  I decided to go with their spicy chicken ramen because I remembered it to be really delicious. It's a chicken bone based soup versus a pork bone based soup. Which means it should be less heavy than a tonkotsu broth and less oily. I guess I was wrong. Jinya's soup base is entirely too thick -- it was like a thin curry sauce. It coated and stuck to the noodles like gravy. It came with thin noodles, which did not compliment it at all cause instead of slurping noodles, I was slurping gravy. The broth itself also was not hot enough. The spice levels were okay. It came with chicken, which was pretty decent. The pieces were really tender.   I didn't want to be a debbie downer so I finished my bowl of ramen without complaining. If I wasn't with my friends, I would have probably not eaten it. It was gross to me. Ramen uses broth and not gravy.  I most likely won't be back. There are better options in the valley.",

The place as most ramen shops are in vegas was a bit small. I did like the ambiance of the place and the inside was very appealing. A LOT of the appetizers that my friends and I wanted to order were actually out of stock during the times we went which was very disappointing. Their ramen either comes with thin noodles or thick noodles and every single time I go there I always seem to forget this. I ordered one of their specials in the Black bowl and it came with thin noodles. It was really good but my noodles even in the broth kept sticking together. I'm glad that this place stays open really late because I usually crave ramen late into the night!",

The server stated that the noodles are usually like this when it's spicy but you couldn't even bite into it. The noodles taste as if they were microwaved.

The broth is so thick and flavorful that the other speciality ramen restaurants. I've only tried the Tonkotsu Black here but I can't change my order because it is so delicious. I do have a few complaints about this restaurant. The taste may be the best, but the service is far below outstanding. They NEVER refill drinks or check on you. We ordered the \"fresh garlic\" that is supposed to be free and the server never brought it to us. We reminded them twice too. Another complaint is that the first time I came here, my noodles were stuck together in a ball and they looked sticky and gross. And my boyfriend told me they made them fresh and when I took a bite it was raw dough and and flour and it was disgusting. I lost my appetite after that. That's the same day they served my boyfriend a hot tea with the teabag tag inside the hot water... Very unprofessional and lazy for the staff to overlook that. I haven't had the best experiences here, but the food is pretty good for the most",

It was amazingly good! It was also very reasonably priced. I was check this spot out again. They have so many combinations that you could add to your soup. The service is great. The location is dim and classy. My girlfriend feel in love with the bathroom setting, she said it was very upscale something she did not expect. The portions are also big we even took home some.

It was a cute place when we sat down, but nothing infuriated me more than this: on my last bite of ramen I choked on what I thought was a sharp leaf. It came out to be a PIECE OF METAL. It was about an inch long and cylinder shaped. I was unbelievably shocked, scared, and embarrassed. I could have died; even the server agreed so! When we asked to see the GM, they did not even address us directly, but somebody else that worked there did. Our meal was, of course, comp'ed. As for the piece of metal, we were told that it was probably from a cleaning brush they regularly use to clean the ramen bowls with. I wish I hadn't have given the piece of metal up so promptly and took a picture first. This was completely unacceptable and easily life threatening. If something does not change there, someone could end up dying.",

Like most japanese style restaurants, space is very limited. Theres a ramen bar, comminal table and a few booths/banquets for seating options in the restaurant.    The menu is pretty simple.  I tried the \"Premium Tonkotsu White Ramen\" which was probably my favorite in comparison to the popular \"Tonkotsu Black Ramen.\" The difference in broth is that the black only contains pork broth and the white has a mixture of both pork and chicken broth. To describe the difference taste wise? The black seemed a bit more rich than the white... and as a personal preferance, I don't like my broth too think or rich.  The Tonkotsu White was perfect for me! I also tried their Takoyaki, which was amazingly delicious! Their \"Jinya Pork Bun\" was ok, I've tasted better, but I didnt despise it.  I love their \"Pork Chasu Bowl\" very much!  Their pork was so tender, and it paired perfectly with the spinach and seasoned egg added in the bowl!  Overall I'm very please with Jinya Ramen! I could definitely see myself coming back for more!",

When we called our server she gave us a weird look and took the plate away, no apology no sorry nothing!! She treated us like it was our fault there was a hair in the food! When she brought our check she said I took the takoyaki of the bill, still no apology! I thanked her and we paid the bill. I asked to talk with the manager who was a little bit more understating and offer us ice cream next time we visit. I explained to her that it should not be my who has to ask for a manager in this situation and someone should apologize  1 star for terrible service, I understand mistake happens but the server should react in a more professional manner instead of giving us attitude and not offering an apology.",

I really like the Tonkatsu Black Ramen and appreciate that it comes with everything you could already want, no need to order any extra. They have a \"ramen sauce\" on the table, but I haven't been compelled to use it. There is a good variety of appetizers here, my favorite so far is the tempura Brussels Sprouts that are really well seasoned, no sauce needed. My one complaint would be that my husband and I keep getting seated in cramped 2-person tables when there are plenty of other non-cramped 2-person tables available. I'm going to start speaking up on this when we go, I'm a bit tired of putting my purse on the floor or on the chair and it getting hit the whole time. Otherwise, I really enjoy coming here. Music is always interesting, tea costs extra but is pretty tasty, parking is easy and there's normally never a wait. It's a little bit less of a drive to make it out here too from the Westside, those few blocks down Chinatown make a difference haha",

    "text": "When we come to Vegas we like to try new places out. I was driving down flamingo and I kept seeing this place so I decided to give it a try. I have never been to a \"real\" ramen restaurant before so I didn't know what to expect. The staff were very friendly and explained the menu and options.   We ordered the gyoza for an appetizer. They had good flavor and taste but all 6 pieces were stuck together. When you tried to separate them with chopsticks they would sometimes split open and spill the contents on the plate. Not a big deal but I wish they would desperate them more before cooking them.   I had the chicken ramen and my girlfriend had the spicy chicken ramen. Only additional item I added to my bowl was extra noodles. She didn't add anything extra. The bowls the ramen come in are huge lots of broth and good proportions. Add in extra noodles and you have yourself a really big meal!  The whole thing was excellent. My only disappointment in the ramen bowl was the lack of chicken. But overall I really enjoyed my meal and I wouldn't have a problem coming again and again to eat here.",

The Spicy Chicken was really good, I will order that next time. We also tried salmon poke tacos, spicy tuna tacos and the tempura brussel sprouts. I reccomend the spicy tuna over the poke and the brussel sprouts were really good as well. We went during the week and had about a 15-20 min wait, not too bad. I'm sure the weekend wait is longer. Seating has to do with the wait too. They have private tables and group tables. If you opt for \"any\" you will most likely sit at a table with other ppl, if you are looking to sit with only your group, the wait is much longer. Be prepared for that. We sat at the large group table in the middle of the room and it wasn't bad. My husband thought it was weird at first but he quickly adjusted. We will be back :)",

This place came highly recommended and the wife and I love Japanese food! So we come in small line to wait 10 minutes. We get seated and we wait about 20 minutes for our waitress. So finally she walks up and has an attitude. Small blond Asian with one sleeve of tats. Acts like she's doing us a favor by taking our order. We ordered a bunch of food, takoyaki, Kara age, the buns, kimchi tacos, the curry bowl and the spicy ramen. All I can say is meh on the food, with some exceptionally bad items. Eveytime our waitress came she just threw our food at us, like here's your shit. My wifes food came quick mine came 10-15 minutes later. Yay i get watch my wife eat! wife heard someone cuss the waitress out so we weren't the only ones I guess.   The curry was a salt bomb and for being a large plate it seemed very small. The ramen was warm by the time I got it, wtf? I did mix it and it got to barely warm... oh and did I mention the flies? We had at least 3 at our table. Yummy just what you want to see at your table as you eat. The music was obnoxiously loud. The only reason this didn't get 1 star was the wife enjoyed her takoyaki.",

    "text": "I'm a fan. One of the best Ramen places in town. A trendy-chique restaurant right on flamingo and decatur. Right away, if you come in during peak hours, you will see a line outside the door, this usually means that this place is really good--and you're right. Right when i walked in, i noticed the big round wooden picnic table that seats probably 10-15 people. They also have a bar and booth seating.  I had a the spicy tonkotsu ramen with cilantro and the seasoned egg, it did not disappoint. The broth is full of flavor and it's what keeps me coming back. You can make every meal into a combo which gives you the option of a salad + gyoza/chicken/etc. The only reason I'm giving this place a 4 star instead of a 5 is due to the inconsistency of the service. I've been here multiple times where the server was talkative, observant, and helpful. Other times, our server was so high off her mind that she forgot everything. We were eating without spoons for almost the entire dinner after asking for them multiple times.  Overall, a good experience. More pros than cons. Will be back.",

I got the \"Sprouting Up\" Ramen $10.80 with Pork Soboro topping +$1.50  Pork broth - Pretty good. Liked it.   Pork Chashu - Had to taste my wife's because they gave the Soboro topping and forgot my chashu but I was almost done by the time I realized it.   Brussel sprouts!  Yes brussel sprouts. Thought there would be a couple of them but there was maybe a handful, cooked perfect and cut in quarters.  They tasted great and matched the other components perfectly.  I'll go back just for this.   Egg - soft yolk. Above average.   Served with thick noodles that were too thick for me  Gyoza was... gyoza  I'll be back for Brussel sprout ramen. Don't forget my chashu next time!",

    "text": "Oh jinya how I love thee, let me count the ways...  1- tasty ramen 2- takoyaki 3- perfect nitamago  4- ikezo peach wine 5- the best bathroom in ever 6- garlic garlic garlic  I could go on and on..... Before I start I have to mention the bathroom. It literally was the reason I ever decided to come here for the first time ever. And is the highlight of each and every visit. You think I'm joking?? Just come here and pay a visit to the loo. You'll get it. First thing you'll notice is how dim and zen like it is. Then as you approach toilet, the lid slowly lifts and the blue lights come on as if to say \"welcome\". Then some type of mist comes on and toilet is rinsing itself for a couple of seconds. When you sit down, every bit of stress and tension leaves you all because the seat is WARM.  Oh man oh man... The rest you can figure out for yourself, just know the bidet is customizable for front and back, fast or slow....  Ok now for the food, Let me start by mentioning the tonkatsu broth. The broth here is outstanding, it's complex with a depth of flavor that can only be gotten from a loooong time cooking. It was rich and soothing and not overly salty.   I ordered the tonkatsu black (ramen with black garlic oil) and added a few cloves of freshly pressed garlic. Wow. Just wow. The fresh garlic subtly changed the fragrance and taste of my ramen in a sublime way. It wasn't overpowering but definitely pronounced. In my bowl I asked for an extra egg as they are perfectly done and taste fabulous. Spicy bean sprouts and extra mushrooms went in there too. The noodles are perfectly cooked leaving just the right amount of chew and texture.   The takoyaki was perfectly executed, cooked crisp, light and fluffy with the perfect amount of octopus in each ball. They serve it on an egg salad bed (which seemed strange at first but it totally went together and seemed to even bring out the wonderful flavor of the balls) and garnished with green onion and bonito strands.   The ikezo drink was interesting- it was like a peach sparkling wine which turned jelly like after it was poured in the glass. Very different at first but it was a fun drink. I wish there were other favors though....  Service can be iffy here. Sometimes you get someone super attentive and aware while other times you get someone disconnected unaware and oblivious to customers needs.    I knew immediately during my last visit that the place had a new manager- longer hours, the music was louder, vibe was different, workers were different and they were at capacity when I came for a late lunch. This was confirmed by an employee after I asked. I'm glad they're busier now than before but I'm not sure if I enjoy the new loud music hipster kind of vibe. It was laid back and zen mode before, very relaxing and enjoyable. Not so much now. And it was uncomfortably hot in there. Like made me dizzy while eating hot ramen type of hot. Uncomfortable and not enjoyable.   Turn up the a/c and everything else can be ignored while I enjoy the fabulous ramen and later have my moment in the bathroom.   Food: 5 Ambience/atmosphere: 2 Service: 3 Value: 4 Overall 3.5 but excellent food along with that bathroom gave it a 4",

The service is a tad slow due since it's always busy. But the service you do get is decent.   The prices($11-$15)are also a tad higher than Monta ($7-$8)/Fukumimi($9-$10).

We sat in the car for about 25 minutes and headed back inside. There was a whole new list made of 6 tables that had got seated before us but arrived after us and we were not on the the new list. A stranger standing in the doorway overheard me asking the lady why these tables got to go before us and chimed in and said the service here is always awful, the only reason people come to this place is for the food, the service sucks. Good for you for serving good food but step your game up, having terrible service is a great way to get bad reviews and lose potential customers.

The flavor of the broth was pretty decent and not overly salty. I ordered it \"hot\" but wasn't really impressed with the spice level. Disclaimer: I have a really high tolerance for spicy food. The seasoned egg was boiled to perfection with the yolk still runny. The chashu here is really tender and almost melts in your mouth. The service here blows. I'm not sure if they are understaffed or if they are just slow. There was not a line when my group came in for lunch AND there were open tables but it took us 15 minutes to get seated.",

I was hesitant to try it thinking that a vegan option at a non-vegan restaurant might lack taste. Boy was I wrong! Hands down, this is the best ramen I've ever had!!! I will definitely be a regular here! Also, their quinoa salad is delicious & only $3 during happy hour!",

    "text": "I decided to cheat on my beloved Ramen Sora and try Jinya after a long day. Dim lighting with hip and trendy vibe. Then seeing a couple cuddling/holding hands got me wondering, \"where am I? Why am I here?\" I felt out of place but soon realized I was just there to eat a bowl of ramen.   Oh.  SERVICE Casual and prompt. Based on few visits, service here can be hit or miss. On my very first visit, we were the only one there yet we waited over 40min. Our server got off his shift in a middle of serving us so he ditched our table completely. What was even better was that kitchen staff threw away our order=reason why we didn't get any of our order.   FOOD First off, Jinya Bun from their appetizer is a MUST. Fluffy bun with super tender, mouth-watering meat inside.   Tonkotsu Assari (~$9): \"Assari\" refers to something light/not too heavy. Broth was flavorful, albeit too salty and oily for my liking. I didn't see anything \"assari\" about the broth.  Noddle was thick and had a chew. One and only thing I liked about my bowl of ramen was the egg.   CONCLUSION I still like Ramen Sora all the way. They have everything down to perfection, from service to their always amazingly delicious ramen. Jinya is open late so might stop by in the future for late night ramen fix.",

Sometimes, their ramen is decent and the rest of the time it's a slightly disappointing, but I can't complain too much because late night eat options are a bit limited. Jinya's pricing is a bit more expensive than nearly every other ramen place in the area. My complaints are really about the food, though. Sometimes the ramen does not come with enough broth and I end up eating noodles only, other times the broth is too salty, or the ramen is not served hot. Ramen is best when served hot; warm ramen is just disappointing. They are opening another Jinya on Rainbow, hopefully that one will be better!",

You can choose one of their put together combos or create your own from a nice mix of ingredients, think.., nori, eggs, veggies.. yummy stuff!  The decor is cute , nice big booths and awesome big family style table. There were 7 of us and there was room for about 10 more. The dishes were fun and Asian . The service was good and quick. Even though we were staying on the strip, we drove here 2 days in a row because it was awesome.",

    "text": "Did some one say J-j-j-jinya?? ..well okay, because it wasn't me.  I've tried really hard to love this place, really I have, but I just can't find the heart to. Seating is always easy to find, out of the 7 times I've been, I don't think I've ever once had to wait for an open seat.  Food is slightly pricier than Monta but you compensate for a little bit larger quantity. Most of the popular appetizer favorites are also constantly present on their ever changing menu as well, like their: takoyaki, chicken karaage, or edamame, with some occasional new ones like the pig ears, and shrimp ball.  I've had their miso, tonkatsu, and even experimented with their new garlic \"cha cha cha\" ramen, but it only left me wanting to \"cha cha cha\" out their door unfortunately. Their cha cha cha was overpowering in onion flavor and drowned out anything else that was even present in the broth. As for their miso and tonkatsu, on the times I've returned it left me thinking the ramen was mediocre at best resulting in either a slightly more bland flavor or more over powering feel, but never a decent balance. I haven't really been having good consistency here..  Don't get me wrong, jinya isn't a bad place to grab a bowl of ramen, but for my own tastes I prefer other places, especial since when I'm grabbing ramen, its because it's my cheap college student budget go to meal.",

I did think they put too much Brussels sprouts in it but that was it. The pork gyoza came out hot and it was yummy. It was smaller than what the pictures made it look like. Flavor of the broth was awesome and it filled me up. It's a great place to go if you have ramen craving.",

We waited near the podium to put on name on the list and just when the host comes back two parties waltz in and the host takes their information before mine.  Hosts should manage the wait list on a first come first served basis.",

That would be a rough wait.   Now good: the service was kind and involved. The recommendation was well received. The thin noodles are fantastic.

It's great for a large group of friends or even eating alone.   I always get the Tonkatsu Black with a Jinya Bun. EVERYONE should try the Jinya Bun. It will change your life -- savory pork belly that melts in your mouth, a mayo-like sauce, with small slices of cucumbers and some greens on a fluffy white bun. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Ramen broth is not too salty. It's actually very flavorful and not too overpowering. I used to be a die-hard thick noodles kinda gal. But Jinya made me appreciate thin noodles which I now love!  And if you're not feeling like getting pork, get the chicken ramen. Much lighter feeling after eating but still very tasty.   I love this place, hands down.",

They have three sauces on the table: one for potstickers (soy sauce), one that is seasoned and contains chunks of garlic (my favorite), and a red spicy sauce for that fiery sting. I will be honest, the clear broth was simple and basic, but when I added the sauce, it brought it to a new level. As I was leaving, the waiter, Gino, came all the way to my car in spite of the snow. Yes, it was snowing hard in Vegas that night. He found a paycheck I had left behind on accident! Oh my goodness, what a high level of honesty. He went above and beyond to ensure I received that check. I am definitely coming back to try other items on the menu.",

Ohhhh gosh when i had my first sip of the broth i told myself \"this is my ramen bar\" lol... The flavor was very balanced! It wasn't salty at all! I totally recommend this place to ramen lovers! The place was really cute and rustic and the service was very good! Please keep it up! I'm actually loving it! ;) also the good thing about this place they're open til 3am!!! Unlike other ramen places here closes so early! I can see industry people eating and drinking here after work. Thank you for the good experience jinya! ;)",

We ordered brussels sprouts tempura (very creative and intricate), octopus balls (I'll come back just for them), and refreshing annin-dofu at the end of our meal. The only thing they're missing is fried rice, which isn't a big deal at all. The service was super fast, hostess/servers were all friendly, and it's not as crowded as monta/spring mountain. It seats about 50 people (spacious), so you can actually enjoy your meal without feeling rushed. HUGE PLUS.",

    "text": "I've only really been to Monta Ramen and Ramen Sora but this place blows it out of the water. I'm not huge on ramen either, I feel they're all the same and have that same distinct creamy taste. However, with Jinya that's totally different.  First off, I love the ambience of the place it's very warm and sultry with dim lighting. The place is fairly small but was packed tonight and wasn't really a wait. The staff is very hands on and seem very inviting as well.   Now for the food, this is my brothers favorite place so he recommend me try the Tokyo Yatai since this was my first time. It was absolutely delicious, the broth was both chicken and pork and had slices of chicken in it as well. I added corn and seaweed and opted out of the bamboo shoots since I feel bamboo really overpowers the True flavor of the broth. The spicy level I chose was hot and it was the right amount of hot for my palette, it wasn't like a bland type of spice only focusing on heat content but this spicy level was more so about flavor content and that's what I like. Overall, it was great and I finished my entire bowl.  Now the negatives as to why I didn't give it five stars, not really a wide selection of beer or other drinks. They had your regular sake's and craft beers with some novelty non-alcoholic drinks like Calpico and ramune but as far as everything else goes I wish they had more non-alcoholic drink options maybe expansion of their sodas or maybe even some Thai tea? Also no free refills which caused me to spend 7 dollars alone on just drinks.  Other than that, I still would recommend this place to everyone. They're doing great. Keep it up Jinya.",

It's either hit or miss with these, so talk to the server and see if your choice is right for you.  That brings me to my next point!  The service here is so friendly and accommodating!   If you're looking for great soup, great service, and great ambiance, then head on over to JINYA Ramen Bar.

I ordered the creamy spicy vegan ramen and was very impressed. I'm going to ask for a spicier broth next time, but even though I wanted more heat the taste was still delicious. It was full of flavor and very creamy. There are lots of options for additional ingredients. I think I'll try adding some bamboo shoots next time. I will definitely be going back to this restaurant. I want to experiment with more ingredients and more spice. Great ramen restaurant. Did I mention that already?",

It's more on the salty side and it doesn't help that their ramen sauce is also really salty. One of my favorites is the kale pops. I was really disappointed when I found out that they discontinued this product. On my last visit, I tried the crispy chicken, the dynamite, jinya bun, and the tempura brussel sprouts. I really enjoyed their crispy chicken but I had to put a lot of lemon juice because it was a little salty for my comfort. I like the jinya bun's well, bun. It was really soft. The pork inside it was basically all pork fat which I found a little disgusting. I wasn't really a big fan of their tempura. It was okay. Nothing special. Their dynamite though is probably what I'll come back for. It's very rich and I love how much seafood they put in their. Too bad it only comes with a few crackers. It would be better if they put more. That way you're not using a spoon to eat the dip like it's an entree. Customer service wasn't too bad. Got seated in a timely manner and staff was very friendly. Again, I wouldn't come here when I'm really hungry.",

Nothing against Studio City, but we also have tried Mid-Wilshire location and notice slight differences with all three.  The food was delicious as always, but I noticed the Tonkotsu pork was a bit more tender and succulent at this location.  Regardless though I highly recommend this as our favorite ramen spot whenever we come across the opportunity.",

    "text": "I was really excited to come to this place.  I waited three days to eat the noodles here.  I'm a vegetarian, so it's difficult to find a place with a vegetarian friendly ramen.  I came around an hour before closing.  This is due to it being the only time I could go.  When we first walked in, it was super intriguing.  Very dimmed lights...loud music too. My husband and I waited maybe 5-10 at most.  Nothing too bad.  While waiting, we noticed that they have a grade C for their food safety... Both my husband and I are very well educated on the proper ways to obtain and A, so we were a little scared.  When we finally was seated, we automatically noticed why they have a C... The dishes weren't sparkling clean, the kitchen looked like they could use people who know how to clean kitchens correctly...When we looked out our spoons, we had to clean them more as it was not cleaned to the fullest extent.  In regards to the food.  I personally thought the takoyaki was great.  The vegetarian ramen tasted a lot better than I anticipated.  So I was excited.  But since it was so close to closing, my husband and I felt rushed to finish eating since they literally gave us our bill the moment we got our bowls.  Quite frankly, we just ate as much as we could and got out as quick as we can since we didn't want to feel like a burden.    I feel like if I came during the day time, (hahah, only if I had the time), the experience would perhaps be less rushed and I could've enjoyed my noodles more.  Overall, I did enjoy the food...It was good.....",

    "text": "This might be my new favorite Ramen joint. I don't necessarily think Jinya beats Monta, but it's definitely on the same level as them. The gyoza may be a little more tasty though.   We've eaten at Jinya a couple of times now. The first when it was still pretty new, and my boyfriend and I both tried Tonkatsu's. I did the Tonkatsu Assari and he the Tonkatsu Black. It's weird because when I eat Ramen, I guess I don't automatically notice the difference in flavor right away, I just think they're all good. I tried mine next to my boyfriends and was able to compare. Both were delicious, so both win. We also enjoy JInya because they offer the option of making your ramen into a combo which includes  a salad and one other item (gyoza, fried chicken, cali roll, or a some kind of meat bowl) We've ordered the friend chicken and gyoza. Good deal! and the chicken is so incredibly juicy and seasoned very well. The atmosphere is really nice also; I liked the decor, but think they could have utilized the center of the room a little better, rather than throwing that oversized group table in the middle. The table is so wide that the center doesn't get any use really; instead it takes up a lot of wasted space. Which wouldn't be a problem if the food tastes horrible and people didn't come there. But seeing as the food is good, and people will visit, they will be busy. Jinya should have realized this and, instead created two tables in the space available that would have been accommodating.  Oh yeah, this is a note for you ladies. Don't forget to check out the bathroom. They have the BEST TOILET I've ever seen. I probably could've stayed in the bathroom for a while and just played with all the amazing things this smart toilet could do. haha.",

I am so happy they have chicken broth and chicken katsu as an option as not many other ramen do. I usually get the chicken dumpling or katsu. It's my go to dish. We have tried many of the apps on the menu and they are all tasty and satisfying. We will be back for our ramen fix.",

    "text": "I'm giving it 5 stars because I think they are the best in town.    Broth:  Tonkotsu Black is the one to get.  It's the most savory broth in town, better than both Monta and Sora (although Sora doesn't have Tonkotsu).  The flavor isn't from the excess salt but truly savory pork.    Pork:  Perfect mix of lean and fat.  Similar to the one at Monta but slightly less fattier.  Noodle:  I usually order the thick noodle.  I wasn't impressed during my first visit because part of the noodle was clumped together...but it was perfect during my second visit.  Appetizers:  Pork belly bun is very good with generous portion of very fatty pork belly...I'm craving for it as I'm typing. Takoyaki is surprisingly good.  Good flavor and texture.  The egg salad at the bottom is also very tasty. Fried Brussel Sprouts:  Nicely breaded with good mild flavor. Fried Chicken:  Also pretty good, tender, crispy, and flavorful  Caution:  I'm not a big fan of the spicy sauce.  It's okay in moderation, but the flavor is too strong that it changes the taste of the savory broth.  I'd stay away from the Tonkatsu Spicy.  Or at least try the Tonkatsu Black first then decide for yourself.    Overall:  Every item we tried has been great.  Good Service.  Suggestions:  Please consider opening for lunch!!!  And I think adding more variety of veggies will make it better (Sora does a good job on that).",

Very fatty, deep broth with plenty of garlic (which I love), good thin noodles and tasty meat. It could use a little more meat and a little less salt. This is good, but I think that Monta Ramen has arguably better or just as good ramen and it's a few dollars cheaper.  The thing that sets Jinya apart is the rest of their menu (not the rice bowls). The tempura brussel sprouts with truffle oil were amazing! They were very crunchy but juicy on the inside and the truffle oil was both fragrant and tasty. It was also well seasoned with salt and pepper. They also have the best takoyaki in Vegas. Sufficient portions of octopus and just a well done, generous portion for $5.20.  They also have a happy hour from 3 - 5 p.m. on weekdays (I want to try their chicken karaage then) and also a lunch special seven days a week from 11:30 - 5 p.m. ($12 set menu with half ramen and half rice bowls, three gyoza, a free soft drink and almond tofu dessert.   We will definitely be back!",

The servers are fast and nice, the vegan creamy spicy ramen is great and the cauliflowers with pine-nuts are surprisingly yummy.  The only negative part I see is that the music is super loud. I get that it's a fast eating place, you sit, eat and get out so another table can get seated, but the music makes hard even a one on one conversation.

None of us are vegetarians, although our friend doesn't eat pork, but this place definitely had something for everyone.   It's located in Chinatown, and very easy to find. The inside is nice, and intimate. The decor is something you'd expect to find in a restaurant in Chinatown. We opted to sit at the bar, facing the line cooks (open kitchen). They were all friendly, especially our server. I wish I would have asked her name, or kept our receipt so I could give her a proper shout out.   I have to mention that they were out of thick noodles and wontons when we went in. They were very up front about it, including posting a sign on the front door.    I ordered their Sprouting Up Ramen, and it was delicious! I am glad I ordered a few extra eggs in the bowl. The thin noodles were really good! I usually order thick noodles, personally, but was pleasantly surprised. The tonkotsu broth is flavorful, the slices of pork are generous, and the bowl was really balanced. The price was reasonable, especially considering the portion size.   I can't wait to go back!",

Once we sat, it took a while to order. My water had something floating in the bottom, I asked a waiter for Nother water well he dumped the water from the cup and refilled it in the same cup, he didn't even bother to look in the cup upon serving it to me and nothing the floating thing in there was in fact still there. Disgusting. Asked another waiter since ours disappeared and there was never an apology, it almost seemed like it was a burden. The soup was great, but something about this place and the people's lack of providing good customer service is definitely present at this location. As someone working around the area, I'll just have to venture out to another ramen place. Who knows, maybe this place is better as a takeout only.",

    "text": "Okay so I love coming to Jinya for the food and recommending all of my friends to come and check this place out. I have been here more times than I can count.   Now for the food it's wonderful, but as for the service mediocre at best, I've had good servers and bad ones. And I've also had times were I have waited 5 minutes for food and 40 minutes. Usually I would complain to a manager and they would take care of us. But I figured I'll put up a review this time. They were not all that busy for the server to be overwhelmed. So to start the host was kind and courteous and got me seated within ten minutes of my arrival. When I was sat down the server came up right away and took my order. After that it went downhill, my food came out quick, which was nice. The server however was not attentive to me after my food came out. First off I ordered water which he forgot to bring. Then I had to request for my water again, after that he would go around his section asking everyone if they needed anything like refills etc. Not once did he come to ask if I needed a refill or how my food was. He would ask everyone but me. To were I felt  like I was being ignored. And this is what I mean about the service being mediocre. This is not the only time it's happened, it has happened on multiple occasions for me and my friends.  I don't come here much anymore, and due to situations like this I slowly lose my interest. I don't know the servers name but it was 3/25/19 around 11pm and it was a man working on the big table in the middle. I would give a one star, but due to food coming out quickly and being good as ever I'll give a 2 star.",

    "text": "Wound up being disappointed by Jinya. I didn't read any Yelp reviews before I visited; now that I have, it appears Jinya has consistency issues and that would explain my experience as well.  I had the namesake tonkotsu black ramen while my friend got the spicy chicken ramen. Now, don't get me wrong; I love garlic, but I just wasn't a fan of the garlic flavor here. And the garlic taste was so overpowering and the broth was also so salty that it completely covered up everything else. To be honest, I couldn't even have told you it was tonkotsu base - that's how crazily garlic-ky and salty it was. To top it off, my broth was lukewarm, so I'm not even sure what they were doing in the kitchen. Even at the bottom of my bowl, I doubt the broth was even 120F.  My friend's spicy chicken ramen was much, much better. It wasn't overly salty and the broth had a nice creamy and smooth feel to it, and it worked really well with the spiciness.  I also really liked the iced green tea, which seemed like it was actually brewed tea. Super tasty and refreshing.  So yeah, if I decide to come back - I would definitely go for the spicy ramen or maybe the namesake white. But the tonkotsu black was enough of a disaster that I'm not really enthused about the prospect.",

    "text": "Lunch with my Yelp Twinsie, Joyce, from Arizona in Las Vegas. ..what a fantastic story!  How can 2 people meet online and become close friends? ?  Yelpers have so much in common!   Back to Jinya Ramen:  There are 7 Jinya locations in California. This is the first one in Nevada. There are none in Hawaii. What does this mean?   Answer: I need to eat ramen with Twinsie at Jinya Las Vegas.  It was a bit chilly outside since it's November - a good atmosphere for a warm dish. I ordered the Pig Ears (JINYA No. 2 Chicharron) to share,  but I had difficulty eating it because it sadly had some firey hot sauce (harissa) on it.  I did enjoy a few bites of its crunchy goodness and some of the fried kale and soft tamago (egg) that accompanied it!  Mmmm!   Twinsie smartly ordered the Takoyaki...oh wow!  Pop one of those tako balls in your mouth and enjoy! !  The texture of the octopus was a \"just right\" chewy - not mushy nor rubbery!   I had the Tonkotsu Assari because it had THICK noodles. The other goodies included the kikurage (aka black fungus), pork chashu, & seasoned egg. YUM!!!  The variety of ingredients was fun so that I wasn't bored! Chewing on al dente noodles makes me happy!   Some readers may not like this part, but I MUST mention it because it was a \"BAM\" moment for me: the HEATED toilet seat in the restroom!!!  Now remember - in the beginning - that I mentioned that it was a chilly November in Las Vegas. ..I mean like in the 40s...  Yeah.  It's a rare thing to find anything heated in Hawaii. ..like a car seat.  So, I really notice and appreciate little thoughtful gestures such as this!  First of all, the restroom is very dim. I guess it's supposed to be a calming atmosphere?  Anyway. ..just sit down and relax! None of that cold, \"wake up suddenly\", shocking kind of feeling. ..but very gentle and soothing! Ahhhh... hahaha!   So, I'm looking forward to another Jinya visit. ..wondering if all locations have this special customer treatment?  ;)  Thanks to Twinsie for such a memorable lunch!  Luv ya!!",

The takoyaki was good as well but I felt like it could have been fried a bit longer because it got soggy very quick, especially on the bottom.   Flavor is good, the deviled egg creamy sauce on the bottom was good and interesting, the generous portion of bonito flakes was also very pleasant.  Problem is that there was to much dough and not enough octopus.   The prices are decent.  Most notably, the price of the takoyaki is surprisingly cheap, which was only $5.50 for 6 balls.   *I am able to compare takoyaki properly because the one I've had in Japan is superb, even at the chain restaurants. Always crispy and always full of flavor and depth.",

    "text": "Without ramen, there would be chaos and darkness.  At least this is how I felt after missing out on eating breakfast during Nadine's tri-state UYE.  I've wanted to stop in this great upcoming-chain ramen joint after seeing Mike W's photos of the place.  Since it had been a windy and cold November Vegas trip, some ramen sounded perfect.  I ordered a JINYA Tonkotsu Black [$10.80 - pork broth with chashu, kikurage, green onions, dried nori seaweed, seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, and served with thin noodles] and a JINYA Pork Bun [$3.80/ea. - thick braised pork with vegetables wrapped in a fluffy, white, steamed bun].  The table also shared JINYA No.2 Pig Ear Chicharron [$8.50 - harissa sauce, crispy kale, and a softly onsen tamago] and an order of Takoyaki [$5.20 for six].  Here's a breakdown:  JINYA Tonkotsu Black:  Delicious!  I love Japanese chashu, which is more like a roulade than the Chinese style, and kikurage [wood ear mushroom] is always fun to eat.  I regret forgetting to ask for some freshly pressed garlic but it was still delicious.  I also asked for a pat of butter for my ramen and it made the broth super rich.  Kotteri!  It had great porky flavoring to begin but I have a weakness for adding butter to my ramen.  I ended up getting full halfway into my bowl.  It had good flavor and wasn't too salty.  The egg was also beautiful softly boiled with a creamy egg yolk.  The noodles were good but I'll admit that I was staring at Nadine's thick noodles with envy.  The thin noodles were good but I want the chewy and springiness of the thick ramen noodles.  JINYA Pork Bun:  This could be dangerous.  Great flavor, good size, and a thick cut of pork belly is nestled in between some leafy greens with a generous drizzle of Kewpie mayo.  JINYA No.2 Pig Ear Chicharron:  Technically Nadine C. of YelpHI ordered this but found it too spicy for her liking.  I wasn't sure what the onsen tamago was for so I used it to dunk my fried pig ears in it.  It helped dilute the spicy hot sauce.  Not bad but I don't know if I would recommend it.  Takoyaki:  When is takoyaki ever a bad thing?  Delicious octopus balls served with some bonito flakes.  They were thick, juicy, and plump.  It even sat on a bed of this hard boiled egg custard type sauce.  Not traditional but it escalated the creaminess of the takoyaki.  I even went back after we were done eating all the takoyaki to scoop up any leftover egg on the plate with some bonito flakes.  I would definitely recommend this.  $65 for lunch for three, including tip.  Very reasonable!  Will I be back?  You know I will! I'm glad I got to try JINYA with my twinsie Nadine C. of YelpHI! Love that girl!",

This place can be loud and packed on the weekends so don't expect to converse easily. Jinya does not have a waiting area and can be very busy, so busy in fact our group had to wait outside for our table. Their shrimp balls and salmon poke taco appetizers were absolutely amazing. They offer vegetarian broth options which can be hard to find at ramen places. Their noodles were perfectly al dente. They offer thick and thin noodles, my favorite being their thick! I recommend stopping in during their happy hour for cheap delicious appetizers.",

I had dumplings, ramen and sake, all three were exceptional. I will be back for sure for some of the best ramen around.

Once we were able to sit down, we ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen and the Tokyo Special Ramen (available until February). Both were delicious. The broth on both of them were so hearty and the noodles were cut and made just right. Not too soft and not too hard but just right.... If I had to pick which one was better I would pick the Spicy Chicken Ramen. The broth is so good and the chicken is so tender. The Tokyo Special is still nice though, they give you a some pork chasu and an egg.  I've tried a few ramen places including Monta, Ramen Tatsu and Ramen Sora and in my opinion, Jinya beats all the others hands down. Highly recommended and I will be back!",

    "text": "The ramen was very good although we ordered the one with the brisket and it's one of those dishes where everything separately was good but just didn't go together. The broth was nice and rich and oily do you don't need a slab of smokey brisket in there. It totally knocked your taste buds out and so the ramen was less enjoyable. I usually recommend getting thinner noodles with ramen because they hold the broth better. Another knock on the place is if you sit by the windows in the afternoon the sun will just blaze your eyeballs. We came late in the afternoon so there wasn't much of a wait but I heard at dinner time there can be a long wait.",

I think their AC was broken because they were using a fan. We live in Vegas too so it was like 108 outside and inside was even hotter.  Overall the soup was pretty good. It's almost as good as Monta Ramen.  We had the spicy chicken soup and the Tonkotsu Black.  The spicy chicken soup eh not a fan. The flavor was kinda off for me. The chicken was not tender and the spinach wasn't a great mix. I did enjoy the Tonkotsu Black. The flavor was really good.  For appetizers, we ordered gyoza and shrimp balls. The gyoza was okay, it was not as crunchy on the sides but the shrimp balls were on point!  This is an awesome lil hidden spot. The ambience has a great feel to it too. The only thing I'd change about the ambience is that huge table in the middle. I would add more smaller tables. A lot of people tend to be not open to sharing with another huge family. Most people just want to cut the small talk and just enjoy the food.",

Food and service was both great. There's usually a long line to be seated, but I would say this place is worth the wait.",

And I when I asked her to repeat whatever she just said cause she was mumbling she answered me in a rude tone. Never been here and not even willing to try it if you let your employees give customers attitude. She was the Asian girl that was working around 6pm on Sunday dec. 23.

This place was my only hope really in Vegas, after having an okay experience at Monta as well as Ramen Sora.   Black Tonkotsu Ramen- 2 stars. I prefer my ramen to be less fatty, so I didn't like the flavors and it was a bit too greasy for my taste.   Tonkotsu assari ramen with fat noodles- 4 stars. I thought this was the best of the 3 ramen I had. It was still missing something for me, but also good enough.   Spicy tonkotsu ramen- 3 stars. It wasn't spicy, and it was a bit greasy for me still.   I thought the soup to noodle ratio was a bit off. Their broth is very small for how much noodle they give you. I think the garlic press w/ garlic is genius, as it upped my ramen flavor dramatically after adding in a clove or two.   Gyoza- 3 stars. This was again average. Nothing to write home about.   Service was stellar. Nice, posh place, and I'm giving them extra half a star for having a ramen drive-through, because that is just too cool for words. It doesn't even exist in Japan (makes sense cuz there's not much land) and a pretty cool option to have. Of all the ramen places in Vegas, I'd say that this place is the best so far. It's not saying too much however, and I'd take a few places in L.A. any day.",

If you like taking pictures of your food, flash would be have to be on lol. However, the food was delicious. Ramen was on point. We got the Sprouting Up Ramen and Tonkotsu Black Ramen (the popular). We also ordered appetizers. The steamed bun and the tako (octopus). Really good!   The waitress was forgetful. We requested the food to come all at one time with the appetizers but they ended up giving us the appetizers first and then the main entree 7-8 minutes later. Appetizers got cold because we wanted to eat it with our ramen. That's okay though. I'm willing to come back and try this place again and hopefully I'll give it a full five stars next time.",

    "text": "'Tis the season. Winters in Vegas get cold! But nothing a warm bowl of rich flavorful ramen can't remedy.  Came here late - probably past midnight on a very cold Saturday - and Jinya was bustling. Thankfully, the wait wasn't more than 10 minutes. Service was quick and to the point - no chitchatting and no BS. The food came quickly and did not disappoint.  Pork buns were solid. Nice piece of fatty but not too fatty, tender pork belly balanced with crisp cucumbers and a tad of lettuce, sandwiched in a fluffy soft bun and topped with just the right the right amount of japanese mayo. The pork belly itself probably could've marinated in whatever magical sauce they use for a little longer.   Now the ramen - we went for a classic tonkosu assari (with pork chashu, kikurage, green onions, soft boiled egg and bean sprouts) and a tonkotsu black (main difference being the addition of nori dried seaweed, garlic chips, fried onion and the use of thinner noodles). The broth in both were rich, alllllmost bordering on being a tad too rich to the point where I couldn't finish all of the broth (a sin in my book). The noodles were perfectly cooked. I'm not quite sure why they use two different types of noodles - a thick and a thin version. I personally prefer the thicker version, but the tonkotsu black only comes with the thin noodles. Eggs were properly soft-boiled (it drives me nuts when ramen joints don't do the egg right!). I'll definitely be coming back again, looking forward to trying some of the other ramen options - perhaps some of the other broths are not quite as rich.",

It's not really enjoyable when you server has to yell at you, and you have to yell back for them to hear you. To make matters worse, there was awkwardness at the communal table between the random couples (yes I've sat at communal tables before without issue). Thank goodness the food was better than I expected! If it was just based on food, I'd have given it 4/4.5 stars.",

I can truly say it is in the top ten foods that have entered my palate.  I lived it so much I walked 1.5 miles from hotel to eat it for dinner tonight.

Honestly, being it my first time I was excited to see what the hype was all about, I got the miso ramen, kale lollipop and some type of bun from the happy hour menu. My ramen was salty!!!!!!! My brothers gf got the vegetarian ramen and hers was fine but my broth was way to salty for my liking. The bun was pretty good. The kale lollipop was seriously GREASY, lack of tempura batter and just soggy. I asked the server to have them make another batch due to the kale being soggy and barely any tempura batter, moments later she bring another batch that looks exactly like the first one and tells me that the chef changed the way they make it because customers didn't like it with too much tempura batter. Well what's the point of advertising something that's meant to be like a vegetable tempura with no tempura batter? Won't be back!",

It is busied after 10pm but slow during the day, so if you don't want to wait come during the day time. But then the line is not bad compare to Broiling Crab! :)",

    "text": "Jinya is the best ramen shop in town. I've been trying every ramen place in Vegas for the last 10 years. Sora, Monta and Ichiza have been my favorite to date with subtle differences that make each unique and about on par with each other. However, Jinya is on another level completely. Jinya has great ramen and offers a variety of broths that are complex and delicious. Most ramen places offer half a dozen add-ons or less. Jinya has a huge add-on menu (20+ options) for the ramen. They have a decent tapas and basic sushi menu, the brussel sprout tempura is crazy tasty. And they have a legit alcohol menu that has craft beers (stone & ballast point) and even a lychee-tini and  mimosas and some nice wines and sake. The decor is like minimalist contemporary and there's always hip jams playing to create a groovy vibe. There's a small section of bar seating, about a dozen tables and one huge group table that seats about 20. I've tried the vegetable ramen, which had so many vegetables I was kinda overwhelmed in a good way. I've also had the spicy chicken ramen, which was so good I actually said while eating \"goddamn this is good ramen\" like 8 times while I was eating it. I hate giving gushing reviews of places I legitimately like because I don't want them to become more crowded, but Jinya is hands down the best ramen in Vegas. If I could get them to change anything, I wish they offered chicken yakitori as a side. Enjoy.",

I chose the spicy chicken ramen at medium heat. They give you two containers for your takeout, one with the broth and the other with the rest of your contents. Wow was it awesome and just a heads up the medium heat which they call spicy has a pretty good kick to it.

They tried their best to accommodate them, but some people are just awful.) The ingredients are quality and the noodles al dente.

    "text": "\"No ramen no life!\" - Wise words from a wise person  Las Vegas has been getting pretty wise these recent years, with it being the hot destination spot for ramen restaurants to open. Its crazy to think that a few years equal to the number of fingers on your hand there was only a handful percentage of residents who knew ramen beyond its instant form? In current day its the hottest thing, always in the spotlight in the local magazines, like its a trend. Thankfully it'll never die out like cupcakes or cronuts.   Jinya is the NEWEST and TRENDIEST of the ramen residents, a franchise with locations in places like California and Texas. Two pages of variety include ramen that can be suited for the carnivorous cravings and vegetarians with their Vegetable Broth Ramen. Ordering in combinations ($4-5) such as gyoza and chasu bowls will get you the best bang for your fairly spendy meal. It wouldn't be trendy without the tapas available of course. The Jinya Bun ($3.80) is a pork steam bun is worth a try (once) if you like steam buns but do pass on the kaarage or crispy chicken. I assume its called Jinya Ramen BAR because they offer various brews, many delicious Japanese beers that aren't widely available. It seems pricey, but trust that the liquor store pricing is not far off, must be the importing.   So the ramen... unfortunately I am not a fan of the four that I've tried. I blame Brittany Murphy. Her awful acting in \"Ramen Girl\" really had me thinking about the soul and heart that True artisans put in their ramen and at Jinya I just don't feel it. I'm probably just crazy though. The Tonkotsu Black and premium white broth's both have a sour finish to me. The garlic chips have a fishy taste, but that could just be me. I enjoy the taste of the chicken broth over the pork here and am much appreciative of the variety that Jinya offers.  Maybe \"Ramen Girl\" was onto something, Sorry Jinya I think there's gotta be more heart and something else beyond the dim lighting, the bidets, the iPad ordering, sushi, the 350k franchise opportunity, and community seating.",

This is a very hip place to dine in the wee hours with very patient and helpful service along with some very fantastic food! I swear we ordered one of everything on the menu.  The pork bun was a perfect little size with deliciously fatty pork tucked inside.  The brussel sprouts were hot and satisfying and the ramen was so good that I couldn't get it in my face fast enough. I am pretty sure which any way you order your ramen, it is going to come out awesome. This place is kinda of small but the service is swift so there usually is one table available.",

But because I love how ramen makes everything feel so much better. Cold? Have some ramen! Sick? Have some Ramen! \"Ramen for you, Ramen for you! Ramen for everybody!\"   Now let's get serious! Not too famaliar with ramen? Go ahead and order their, \"Spicy Chicken Ramen!\"  The dish is acca-mazing. Order it level, \"spicy!\" (For my, \"spice-cravers\" go ahead and kick it up a notch! It really isn't spicy as they claim.)  The dish is already garnished with two slices of meat, some beansprouts, spinach, etc... Not enough garnish for you? Well my friend? You are in luck! Go ahead and choose all the other options you want! \"BOK-CHOY? SPINACH!? CORN!? BUTTER?! MORE MEAT?!\" ADD IT ALL! Like I said, no judgement here.  You even get to choose the type of home made noodles you want in your dish!  There side orders are even more amazing. I tried everything and its, \"mmm- mmm-gewd!\" Especially the crispy rice and ahi tuna (i think that's what it's called).  Service: I have to say it's great but not amazing! Sounds bad but it's not that bad. The only comment I have is that some of their servers might need to remove there tunnel vision. I would've gave a five star but i think my friends and I sat there waiting on our waiter to come by with the check but she never showed. Maybe she was busy, and or left but some waiter ended up helping us.   The End.",

The servers seem apathetic at best.  Even the food has gone \"down-hill\". I've had food served to me cold. Missing ingredients. Even the wrong order completely.  I've found some other Ramen places that are MUCH MUCH better. The only saving grace for Jinya is a central location and open late.",

I also believe Jinya has the best egg to add into their ramen.  Sometimes it's incredibly busy with waits up to 45+ minutes-other times you sit down right away. It really just depends. I would definitely classify this as my #1 ramen place in town.",

We ordered the cilantro lime ramen and chicken wings appetizer.   The food was tasty and full of flavor.  The wings were well seasoned and fried hard.   However,  they were still juicy and not dried. That also have vegetarian options as well.   My date is not big on ramen, but he did try my food and he agreed it was good. It is something he would order and eat in the future visits.  The soup base was very good,  which I feel determines the major of the flavor with ramen as other noodles such as Pho.  It's located in a freestanding building on the parking lot of shopping center,  so there's lots of free parking.   This place is a good value for the quality of food. If you like soups or are short on time,  you can be in and out real quick. It was reasonably priced.  We spent $25 for two for lunch.  I recommend trying this place out if you are on the area.",

This was my first time trying this as well, so I'm not exactly sure how the soup is suppose to be, lol. Maybe next time it'll be less like gravy.

Our waitress was also super sweet, but unfortunately I can't remember her name at the moment. She was able to explain how to order ramen and explain the options to my parents who weren't familiar with the menu, and she was very patient with our special requests on removing or adding items to our dishes.

The concept is cook and the interior very hip with a lot of wood. Service is very attentive and Japanese.  I ordered the garlic ramen which was tasty, though a bit oily. Noodle were not bad, though still not quite the level of chewiness I desire most. The broth was salty (most ramen broths are) but flavorful.  I like how you have many noodle choices, can add on sides to make combos, and have lots of options for broths.   Overall, not the best ramen I have ever had but above average for Las Vegas.",

I ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen and I was a bit disappointed. I was expecting a rich pork flavor but it just wasn't right. I think this is where some ramen places try to overdo it instead of just letting the pure pork broth flavor come through. I remember what I visited Tokyo and went it Ichiran in Shibuya and they are by far the best tonkotsu ramen I've had. But the reason why I gave my 3 star rating is their pork belly bun was delicious. I will still come back to this place and try their other offering but would definitely suggest to the chef to just make their ramen simple but delicious.",

It tastes so nuanced and hearty and savory. I was shocked. I added the hot chili sauce a few bites in and things got even better. I also got the caramelized cauliflower and it tasted AMAZING like nothing I've ever tried before. I felt extremely full and very very happy, would highly recommend.",

Not too salty.  Comes with an egg, a couple of pieces of chaschu pork, green onions.  My favorite is the premium tonkatsu white because it's a mixture of the chicken and pork broth.  The chicken ramen (with the chicken chaschu) isn't bad either.    Chaschu pork has a good amount of fat and meat.  It's not entirely fat like Monta's, which is great.  Service is prompt and fast.

The takoyaki had a very nice preservation and came with a sauce that was creamy and very rich. It was delicious at first but by the end the richness was very overpowering. The octopus was roughly chopped and inside a fried ball shell.   Gyoza was alright. Not the best but not the worst I've tried. Not memorable.  The jinya bun was my favorite.

    "text": "Hmm, where do I put Jinya... That's the million dollar question. But after careful consideration, I believe 4 stars is accurate. This is probably my toughest place to review, so bear with me...  First time I was here, I ordered the tonkatsu assuri, their cheapest ramen at 7.90. I thought the flavor was ok, but it didn't blow me away. My friend ordered a veggie ramen, he said that he liked it a lot, but I thought that was ok.  I came next during their HH and sampled the world renowned Jinya bun and crispy chicken, aka karage. Things were starting to look up!! The Jinya bun is a pork belly bao, and probably ranks up there with Wendy's ribeye bao. It's grilled with a delicate BBQ sauce, and it is extremely tender, and the fat is nice and melty. It's a little pricy at 3.00 during HH. The karage is a great deal during HH. This isn't your normal, popcorn chicken sized crispy chicken. These are 5 large hunks of chicken, that are super crispy and moist!! So good! I do have regrets of not ordering the quinoa salad that a neighboring table ordered, it looked very appetizing.  On my last visit, I was feeling full from a late lunch so I decided to get something small so I ordered the small pork chashu bowl. The best part of this bowl was the rice, it was perfectly cooked. I was disappointed in the pork chashu. It looked like the leftover bits from the Jinya bun meat. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great, there wasn't a lot of fat on it, but it wasn't dry. Overall, I thought it was kinda bland.  The service here is really good. They really do a good job of taking care of you. The ambiance is really great, especially the large communal table in the center. I don't know if this would be my go to ramen spot, especially with so many unique ramen spots in town, but it has a great vibe and would be a fun hangout spot with friends.",

    "text": "Jinya, whatever culinary wizardry you got going on in the kitchen, keep it up! My tastebuds thank you.   Jinya reawoken my love for ramen in Las Vegas. Granted, I've only had the chance to try Monta so far, I can quickly say that I preferred the (less saltier) ramen at Jinya. The broth was wonderfully delicate - It's not a condense, salty, ghastly rich and difficult to digest broth like Monta's. (But hey, if that's your thing? Just not for me.) I'm typically an advocate of strong, punch-you-in-the-face flavor, but something about that broth at Jinya kept me sipping and savoring the quality ingredients of the comforting broth.   I can understand that some may feel that the lighter at broth at Jinya is unfavorable. However, I have to argue that if you feel so inclined, you can always add dashes (or tablespoons) of the delicious bottled ramen seasoning and thick spicy sauce that is conveniently sitting on each table, in order to adjust the boldness of your ramen broth. You have control of customizing the flavor of your ramen? I'm down with that! Honestly, my boyfriend and I didn't go crazy with the table-side ramen seasoning - a few dashes will set it off just right. Enjoy savoring that broth, close your eyes if you need to. It's actually more wonderful than you can even imagine, when you take it all in with the perfect bite: some broth, a little bit of noodles, some seaweed, some corn (if you added it), some chashu, etc. and slurp away! It just hugs your tastebuds and your belly.   Here's what I recommend:  - Jinya Tonkotsu Black ($10.55) - 2 slices of pork chashu+ kickurage+ green onion+ nori dried seaweed+ soft boiled seasoned egg+ garlic chips+ garlic oil+ fried onion+ thin ramen noodles. Yeah. This is the broth I was talking about when I wrote my love story above. The thin ramen noodles were perfectly cooked, al dente. The soft boiled \"seasoned egg\" is ultra luscious, silky, and also cooked perfectly. All of the components in this ramen were meant to be eaten together. I truly enjoyed the delicate nuances of garlic in the broth, it was not at all pungent or artificial tasting. I also feel that the toppings I chose were perfect for this ramen-   Toppings added:  - Corn ($1) - I love corn and I love corn in ramen soups! It adds a lovely pop of texture and sweetness with each slurp of the broth. Highly recommend.  - Fresh Garlic (FREE) - They bring out a small jar of raw garlic cloves that have been soaking in water and also provide you with a metal hand garlic press. You can freshly press the garlic yourself and adjust how much garlic you want in your soup. The garlic flavor is very smooth and not aggressive, because the soaking method removes a lot of the pungent, spicy, bitterness in the plain raw garlic. It really enhanced the garlic flavor in the Tonkotsu black broth and brought the ramen to a whole notha' level. If you're are a garlic lover, I highly recommend!  - Extra Pork Chashu ($2 for 2 pieces) The chashu here is indeed buttery, but there is also a good amount of enjoyable, tender, meaty substance - unlike the flimsy fatty chashu that just disintegrates into the broth at Monta.   We also tried: - Jinya Bun ($3.80) - Daaaym! that pork belly is buu-tter-yyyy!!! That pork belly is what makes the bun unforgettable. The toppings and the sauce were on the simple/weak side, so I can't necessarily say I need to order this every time I come here. But I would definitely recommend this for first-timers to enjoy that expertly cooked, buttery pork belly.    - Takoyaki ($4.80) - Philip T. didn't joke around when he said it was one of the better versions (if not the best) takoyaki in Vegas. It came out hot, plump, juicy, and it even had cooked egg white chunks (egg salad?) in the mayo! That was totally unexpected and added such an amazing texture and unique flair to the beloved classic. Take your takoyaki ball and just run it along the plate to pick up any (and all) of the takoyaki sauce and chunky mayo sauce - sounds weird, but that's how it was meant to be eaten! The octopus inside each ball was also cooked perfectly, moist and extra tender.   Not only was all of the food we tried satisfying, I was also really diggin' the ultra sexy vibe and bossy decor here. Plus, right when we walked in, their amazing song playlist completely captured my attention. They played back-to-back-to-back jams that were right up my alley. I'll admit it - I used SoundHound the entire dinner to figure out what exactly was playing, since I needed to add it to my playlist. I can only recall 1-2 places in my entire life, where the music really set an amazing mood for dinner. I'm so happy to report that Jinya was certainly added to my list as one of those places.   I am relieved they are open late until 3 am (!!!), in Vegas it's necessary and a step above all of their competitors. They also have a ramen/ Japanese tapas drive-thru coming soon! No way? That's crazy! I can't wait until next time!",

    "text": "I discovered this place from a couple of friends after watching Fifty Shades of Grey. (Obviously the movie pegged my appetite.. for food anyway, haha!)  Let's start off with the decor and the environment. The lighting is dim, which I didn't mind. The tables and chairs kind of bring me back to old Japan town or something. There's booth amongst the side and a HUGE table in the center - perfect for big parties  If you've ever ate at Monta Ramen then you'll notice the menu being very similar. I was recommended the spicy chicken ramen (mild) with added butter and tofu. I can handle my fair share of spiciness, but I wasn't sure how it would be here. If you rather be safe than sorry - go ahead and order a mild. They have their spicy powder available on the table for you to add to your heart's desire. The ramen was served in a huge bowl so it appeared to have larger portions than Monta Ramen (although I can't verify that). The dish was flavorful and delicious. Our friends ordered the Jinya bun that resembles a siapo (meaty, steamed bun) and creamy shrimp tempura (awesomeness on a small appetizer plate).  Now, the only reason why I rated it 4 stars was due to the fact that my side of tofu came pretty late =( The temperature heat of my noodles subsided a lot by the time I was delivered them.  Overall, I look forward to returning here. It definitely will change your view and taste palate for noodles. You'll never want to cook a packet of instant noodles ever again.",

    "text": "First time here, was looking for a late night bite from our travel from SD. So this place caught our eye since it was a ramen place opened til 3am.   We were greeted and seated quickly as we entered. Our waitress Alex explained their menu, informative.   My husband and I were eager to try the Jinya bun and it was delicious!! The charshu pork was so tender and flavorful, it's a must! I'd come back here just to eat it!  My husband ordered the Tonkatsu Black and outta 10, he rates it 7.8. He enjoyed it but it wasn't the best.   Our friend Ryan and I got the Tonkatsu Asari, the broth was light and the ramen was filling. Wish there was one more piece of the pork, it was yummy- it comes with one! I usually don't finish mine, so my husband added my thick noodles to his broth. Ryan prefers a thicker noodle for the ramen. My fave part of any ramen is the egg, it was cooked perfectly but it did not have any flavor- minus a star.   Overall this place hit the spot, I'd come back. The one thing we didn't like was how loud the music was playing. The set up was nice!",

    "text": "If I could, it would be 4.5 stars but since they don't have that, 4 wouldn't be good enough for this place so it deserves 5.   I've been a Monta fan for a while now. Going there at least once a week. I decided to try this place since it's new. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the server and running. The server names Alex immediately asked if we've been here before. We said no so she kindly explained the menu and her favorite things on there and asked if we'd like drinks. After quickly coming back with them, we ordered. She even asked us if we'd prefer getting the appetizers first or if it didn't matter if we get the ramen first. No one has ever asked that before. She showed that she really wanted us to enjoy our dinner there! She was so full of energy and looked like she really loved being there. Her alone would make me give this place a 5. I adore her.   Now to the food, the gyoza was great. An 8 piece appetizer. Cali roll was delicious too! I'm used to going to ramen places that either didn't have rolls or had really tasteless ones so I was really happy with it. The pork chashu bowl was amazing and even the small was big! They even flavored the pork before. A decent selection of beer as well. I can't remember the ramen I tried exactly but it was something black. Very good! I tried my boyfriend garlic something ramen (sorry I suck haha) and I liked that one better personally! Some of the appetizers come with salad as well!   The place is very nice looking. Dim lights and they even have a large party table in the middle!   I loved this experience. Great food and service I've never seen before. Only reason it would be 4.5 stars is it's a bit more expensive. Definitely recommend it. Found my new favorite ramen place!",

    "text": "JINYA have a diverse menu compared to most Ramen restaurants in Las Vegas. They offer dishes to add onto your ramen like pork gyoza, Tokyo curry rice and crispy chicken. JINYA also has an additional page of tapas, rice bowls and desserts.   My waitress recommended the pork bun to start. At $3.80 it was the most expensive single pork bun I have ordered. It arrived on a small black plate with a toothpick in the center to hold it together.  It ended up being a reasonable size for the high price. The bun was fluffy and unlike most pork belly the meat was lean. It was also very tender but I thought the lettuce in the bun was unnecessary and would have done better with just the cucumber. The sauce did not pack enough punch for me so I mixed the house made ramen sauce and chili sauce to dip the rest of the bun into.   For my ramen, I decided on the chicken ramen because my waitress said it was her favorite and had just as much flavor as the pork broth without being too rich. She was right, it was the most flavorful chicken ramen broth I have had. It was rich, creamy, but the noodles were too chewy for my taste.   JINYA ramen has a much better chicken broth than any of the other ramen restaurants I have been to in town. Their three house made sauces are well executed and their diverse menu will bring me back even if I am not in the mood for ramen.",

    "text": "Lots of pluses for JINYA.  1. It's from LA, so that makes it feel cool. 2. The interior is decorated pretty hip with a big communal table in the middle. 3. When they saw that I had kids with me, they set up our table with kids bowls, spoons, and forks. How cool is that??? 4. The ramen has a really great taste. I think the broth is stronger/creamier than other places, and it comes with more accoutrements inside.  The price is a little higher (I think I paid $10.50 for my bowl), but that's mostly because it came with some kind of toasted garlic, a whole hardboiled egg, seaweed, pork, and a couple other veggies. Overall, I think the price is probably comparable for what you get.  All ramen places: can you please provide fountain drinks???? I don't really like paying $2 for a can of diet Coke!",

The Jinya bun, which consists of Chashu Pork is so good. It literally saddens me when I finish one. The Brussel Sprouts are crispy on the outside, and nice and chewy on the inside, as a brussel sprout should be. The Takoyaki is terrific. I've only had it once before as a child in Japan, and I can honestly say that this was better.  Service: Our waiter and the cooks inside greeted us with the obligatory \"IRASHAI!\" upon entry. He welcomed us to Jinya the first time we came, and explained almost everything on the menu, including his favorites.   Decor: Very interesting layout, with booths and a community style large table in the middle. It is funny to see how us Americans require our space, as strangers will almost never sit directly next to someone.",

    "text": "This might be my new favorite ramen spot in town.  Most people would steer towards Monta to get their ramen fix and I don't blame them. It's a legit spot. But this time around I was near the Chinatown area and wasn't feeling the idea of having to wait so we decided to give Jinya a shot since I've heard about how good they were from a variety of different people.  Located inside an old Taco Bell restaurant, they really did a great job remodeling the exterior and interior to create a cozy and dim environment. A little bigger than the Monta in Chinatown but I think ramen spots are suppose to be intimate in size. Anyway, let's talk food.  Ordered the Crispy Spicy Tuna since the prices here were half the price than they would be on The Strip. I was curious to see if there was going to be a difference in taste due to the price cut but nope! It's just as good! Also ordered a side of gyozas (ask for them extra crispy) since I usually like to throw them inside my ramen and it balanced out really well. My boyfriend even enjoyed them plain and he's usually not a gyoza or potsticker lover.  I decided to try the Tonkatsu Black and my God it did not disappoint. I was pretty surprised by how it wasn't as salty since I'm usually gulping down my water cup after a few slurps of broth. My face usually swells up after a large sodium intake but the fact that it didn't was very impressive in my book.  Knocked down a star since there was so many servers on the floor but I still had to flag a waitress down for some basic requests. Mind you that this restaurant is small. Service should be more than just taking your order and disappearing but I'm sure this place will look up since they're still fairly new.  I will be back regardless. Especially when there's a drive-thru lane attached!",

Price at the higher side which priced the same as new york city but considering the rent is incomparable to ny...  Overall great atmosphere, modern design, and nice feels of big city restaurant. Pro on foods: thin noodles cooked perfectly with nice tender bites... friend ordered a pork chausau rice bowl was quite delicious, and nice sauce combination. Con on foods: soup based just way too thick and creamy which i have been to more than 10 ramen shops and Jinya gotta be the creamiest of them all... flavor wise was just okay due to the richness is getting destroyed by the thickness of the soup based.. Thick noodles did not cook thoroughly which is still raw and tough...  prices are too expensive for the portion and quality  Will visit again but wont be anytime soon...",

    "text": "Newly opened restaurant, so definitely a few kinks to work out. The first problem is the shortage of wait staff and delayed seating of patients. We waited approximately 10 minutes for a table for 4, even though there was an empty table available the whole time we waited.  A party of 2 walked out since they were also waiting, but several 2 seat options were available the whole time they waited as well.... So efficiency and customer service definitely needs some work!  The restaurant decor is modern with wood paneling.  They also have a large family dining style table in the center, good for a large group.  One thing lacking is lunch service...I think they are missing out financially by starting their service at 3pm....   In regards to appetizer options, I would say Jinya ranks #1 of the ramen restaurants (even over Monta Chaya) for the variety of offerings.  The pork belly buns are $3.80 each or $3 during HH 3-5PM.  The pork belly is extremely tender and flavorful and the bun is nice and fluffy (pretty much like Peking duck but pork belly inside).  We also tried the truffle oil tempura brussel sprouts which were tasty but I've had better brussel sprouts (i.e. Yonaka).  The crispy chicken (comes in 5,10,15 piece orders) was extremely moist and had a nice crispy exterior, paired with a yuzu soy sauce. I would definitely order the chicken again.  I was a little disappointed when we sat down and the waiter started listing off multiple items they had run out of (i.e takoyaki, shrimp toast, assari ramen, etc).  Not really a good start with half the menu items missing or unavailable =(  I'm a takoyaki fiend, so I was very sad to hear they ran out.  The waiter informed us that the shrimp toast is being removed from the menu....not sure why, since he said it was delicious.  In terms of ramen, the following are my rankings for Vegas: 1. Kogashi ramen with thick noodles (Fukumimi) 2. Tonkatsu black with thick noodles (Jinya) 3. Tonkatsu with thick noodles (Monta)  The tonkatsu broth at Jinya has depth of flavor and the broth is very hearty.  I prefer the broth here over Monta, since Monta can often be too salty.  I ordered the tonkatsu black which has garlic oil and chips, chili paste, a whole seasoned egg, nori, kikurage (fungus), green onion, nori,  The flavor marriage of these items makes the broth stand out and I would say the broth is on par with Fukukimi's broth, albeit different.  The pork belly is not quite as fatty as Monta's,  but is flavorful and tender similar to Fukumimi's.   The one thing that leaves Jinya at #2 in my rankings, is the consistency of the noodles.  My noodles were slightly overcooked and some noodles were clumped together in a ball....  Hopefully, they work that out, since I think the consistency of the noodles is very important to the ramen experience.  A nice touch is the raw garlic that is free, they bring over a garlic press so you can have fresh pressed garlic to your hearts content.   The wait time for the ramen was about 15-20 minutes after our appetizers...they are definitely lacking the efficiency of Monta.  However, if you want to sit and chat, this is the place to go.  You never feel like they are rushing you out of the restaurant.   I'll definitely be back to try this place out in another month or so, I'm guessing things will be even better then!",

We tried Tokyo ramen and tonkotso black and the latter is way much better with more flavor profile. I'm a firm believer that in a ramen the broth should take centerstage and this particular one definitely delivered.",

We saw on other reviews that it was rumored to be better then Monta and/or sora, so expectations were already high.    To be honest, I don't think it was better than Monta, but it was better than sora. JINYA and Monta are both on equal terms but jinya's other menu items are what out them on top.    We ended up getting Tonkatsu assari mild, Tonkatsu black, JINYA chicken ramen with extra butter, takoyaki, pork gyoza, and JINYA buns. All were so delicious (especially the JINYA buns... So good)",

    "text": "Good food and nice atmosphere. Service was a bit lacking. There was a line when we got there, so we just added our names to the list on the clipboard. Not a lot of waiting space so we waited outside in the parking lot. When they called our name they put the five of us in a booth with one on a stool. It worked well enough. There seemed to be space available at the big table where they could have been seating more people, but often there were empty seats, tables while people still waited. We ordered our drinks and we had two people order water and beer. Beer came, no water. Asked again. Nothing. Asked again. Nope. Asked a fourth time and got one water, out of the two we asked for.  And by this time we had ordered dinner and had our food. Also, FYI they have soda, but it is in a can. When we ordered our food they made a point of reminding everyone that ordered that they were out of thick noodles, so they would all be thin. Fine with us and there had been a handwritten sign on the door saying this. But I ordered one of the bowls or ramen only to be told they didn't have that. Sucked because that ramen was the reason I wanted to go here. I ordered something else and we were fine. First bowl shows up. A minute later two more. Another minute and bowl four shows up. We wait... and wait. Probably five plus more minutes and the last bowl shows up (also when the first glass of water showed up). I don't know if the vegetarian ramen takes longer or what, but that is the bowl that was last. Everyone said there food was really good. I liked mine and my husband's was tasty too. When the check comes we all throw down twenties. We give the waiter twenty-two bucks over the bill and ask for change. He comes back with two ones and two tens. I wanted to tip around fifteen, but since that's the change we got, we put down twelve. Most waiters give you an assortment of bills when you get change. Oh well. A good place and I would go back, but not expect the best service. Not sure how much is language barrier or how much is they were just busy.",

The first time I came here I had ramen with thin noodles in the tonkotsu black (I think that's what it was called) and it was okay but not great. I now know that the tonkotsu assari aka Jinya #3 with thick noodles is the way to go. We came during happy hour, and if you do too, please order those bao buns. You'll thank me later. $3 bites of deliciousness.   The broth here is sublime and our server was awesome. I also like that they have a veggie broth for my friend's pork/beef allergy. Five stars for Jinya!",

The music they played reminded me of a cool lounge spot... Just really laid back but classy, not to mention the staff was very knowledgeable about the menu, friendly, and helpful! I would defiantly be back for more... So far my only complaint is that the restaurant as a whole is kind of small, but with that out of the way I still highly recommend you to check this little gem out!

There are so many flavors and toppings in this specific bowl, even if you aren't vegan or even vegetarian you would still love this bowl of ramen. The portions are perfect and you can always choose the option for extra noodles. The music and overall vibe of this establishment is so welcoming and fun. I always have a good time when I come here even if I'm tired or just having a bad day. I took my dad here a few days ago and he's not a huge fan of ramen. He also had the spicy creamy vegan ramen and he ate every last drop.   I will always recommend this place to anyone and everyone.  The location isn't a super convenient place but it's no big deal at all.  There's also a drive thru which I have yet to check out but I think getting ramen in a drive thru is pretty cool.",

When we asked the server, she gave us excuse of having a lot of tickets and new chef even tho the place was not  full and busy at 12am. Server was rude and almost slammed my brother's food in front of him. Also after 5 minutes into eating, someone came again to offer us another bowl of ramen which was definitely not ours. You need to get your kitchen and server together. I brought my brother and his wife who came out of town with me this time and I was embarrassed by the service that you provided.",

    "text": "\"I'm sorry your ramen is cold, the BEST I can do for you is MICROWAVE it\"  This was the response from the server after I received not lukewarm, but actually COLD soup.  I have been a regular here for years and I used to recommend the place to other chefs and restaurant professionals that Iwork with. However, the quality and service have declined so much over the years I would tell anyone to avoid this place at all costs.  The last four times I have come here the ramen was barely warm. The noodles had been sitting too long and gotten slimy and the broth gelatinous. Refrigerator cold add on toppings didn't help improve the experience.   Let's talk about \"service\". Last night I was there with two friends. We ordered an appetizer and drinks and three entrees from one server who never once returned to the table again for the entire meal. The drinks and apps came in a timely manner. (\"Whoops I forgot glasses for the pitcher of beer\")   We got one bowl of ramen. Ten minutes later we got one more. Another 10 goes by an I flag down a random server to tell him my ramen is cold ( it's been in the window for 10 minutes, \"How about that microwave, for food you just paid for, that wasn't made right, how bout we just nuke the crap out of it for you?  It's the very BEST we can do\") and we are still missing an entree.  The server  dismissively says, \"Oh, I know, we are still waiting on that\".   (We just figured you didn't want to all eat at the same time, but rather, take turns watching each other eat)  Get your sh*t together Jinya.",

    "text": "I love this cute little ramen house  I came here with my girlfriend right before they closed after a crazy night out.  There was only one other party inside.  Once seated, we were pleasantly surprised that they had late night happy hour.  However, the one ramen bowl on the HH menu was out.  We went for their shrimp balls on the HH menu to start.  For my ramen, I went with their Jinya Chicken with added corn and spinach noodles instead.  The Jinya Chicken consisted of chicken broth instead of pork base.  It also had bean sprouts, green onions, chili, spinach, and chicken.  I also asked for some black garlic oil on the side.  It was still a little bland so I added some of their gyoza sauce to give it more flavor.  I wish they had vinegar instead.  It was very good and super filling.  As for the shrimp balls, we had ask the waitress how big they were.  They were a LOT bigger than what she told us.  They were good though.  Extra crispy on the outside and filled with lots of delicious shrimp pieces inside.  It came served on a spicy mayo sauce.  We couldn't finish them.    Our total was about $25.  I thought pricing was very cheap and reasonable.  The bowls all run about $11 each and any additional add-ons, such as corn, is another $1.  The service was excellent.  The girl waiting on us was very bubbly, sweet, and knowledgeable.  The food came out fast.  The inside of the restaurant is small but cute.  It has an urban vibe, which I like.  Overall, it's a solid ramen house that I would come back to.",

I think the proximity to the Strip is part of the problem; I've seen waits of 45 minutes even on a weeknight. Their specials are well priced, the food is good, and the service is usually great even when it's packed. I like the communal seating option too (if you've been to Asia, sharing tables really is pretty normal). It's a bit far from me so it's never going to be my go-to spot but if I'm heading home from the Strip and in the mood for ramen, this is where I'll be.",

As for their service its pretty subpar, they take your order and then they bring out the food, had to ask for anything else that we needed.",

I bring so many of my friends, family and the occasional work meeting here to try ramen for the first time and they all are just blown away. BUT my last experience was something truly regrettable. In True Japanese fashion the restaurant is small and intimate, which adds to the ambiance in a positive way. It gives the restaurant and very authentic feel but it seems it is getting busier and busier. Wait times are outrageous; last time my family and I waited for over an hour and a half. To add insult to injury, they were out of stuff! PLEASE consider adding a second location. Somewhere in Henderson would be fantastic. To fight through traffic and then wait for nearly 2 hours to be served is really discouraging, no matter how awesome the food is.",

Keep it up and I would say they finally raised the bar for ramen in this town! Their broth (tonkatsu premium white) is less salty, thick and creamy. It sits well in your stomach. It doesn't feel fattening, and is really light. When you eat it, it goes down so smooth and you don't feel humongous after you eat a bowl. You simply feel satisfied.  Get the combos for more for your buck! Awesome prices. Chasu bowls are really good. The Jinya bun is suuuuper yummy I could eat those all day.  The atmosphere is awesome. Nice setting. Loud music. When you walk in they immediately greet you hello. When you walk out they immediately greet you goodbye. You feel like you're a famous someone, and that's an awesome feeling! The waitresses are super sweet! She even remembered me after just two visits. This place is definitely a hot spot.   Their girls bathroom is also pretty awesome. And I love the fact that they're open late til 3am. Finally don't have to rush for ramen because most of them close at 11am.  Kudos to you, Jinya.",

We finally got the time to come to JINYA, and it was good! Probably not out favorite tho. Despite that statement, their ramen is still pretty good.   We walked in and the design is so pretty! There was no wait so we were seated right away and at once all of their staff greeted us (super awesome!!). They greet each guest that arrives and it just kicks off a great first impression.   We opted for the Takoyaki as an appetizer, which is a popular Japanese dish made of octopus balls with bonito flakes (fish flakes that move!!) I've seen this dish in maybe 3 other restaurant I've ever gone to and this was finally my chance to try it. We enjoyed it, but felt like something was missing. Still a good experience tho!!  For our bowls I got the JINYA Tonkatsu Black Ramen and I added corn and fresh garlic to it. It came with thin noodles and I kinda regret that I didn't request for thick noodles.. I feel like I might've enjoyed the thick noodles better. The broth was not as rich as I anticipated for. I've had richer broth before - this just had something missing. I had to then add extra sauce and seasoning to it to reach my liking. Nonetheless I did end up enjoying my bowl and it filled me up super quick I had to make my BF finish the rest for me!   My BF ordered the JINYA Chicken Ramen. He enjoyed it! I didn't get the chance to try some of it but he also agreed that there was something missing.   Maybe we just need to come another time and try more! I love how they have happy hour so we shall be back!",

She went over the menu fast but it as informative.   Seating is ok, there are plenty of booths. All the seats are wooden though, even the ones right at the front near the kitchen. You can see right into the kitchen from any where you sit at. You can see the chefs at work.   Lighting is good, not to bright but low enough to set the mood and theme   The side salad dressing was garlicy. The side of crispy chicken was a good size, 3 pieces as an add on combo  Tonkotsu Asari was good. The broth was light and flavorful. Their noodles were cooked properly. The egg was cooked properly also but had no flavor. This was an overall great experience. The food and service was good but music was to loud would be my only complaint.",

Wait could be long, sometimes. Ramen is ok, the pork belly bun was really good. Service is not the greatest; nice waiters, but they don't really come to check on you, I couldn't get a drink refill. We also waited a lot for the pork belly. They do apologize about that tho, but I wouldn't wait that long again.",

The interior is great and since I come in at night, it has dim lighting. They don't close until 3 AM which is even better! Service is always excellent and our drinks are always filled.  It does get busy around midnight so prepare to be on a wait list. I went there recently and the music selections have improved  :-)",

    "text": "Jinya has THE BEST Vegan Ramen in Vegas. Honestly it may be the best vegan/vegetarian ramen period. Other ramen bars like Manta only offer chicken or pork based broth, but not here.   I take out of town guests here when visiting as i can rely on it to always be a crowd pleaser. Most recently I took my cousin and a friend here this past Saturday for lunch. They said it was the best ramen they've ever had.   One tip is to come here early. The restaurant is tiny with only 7-8 \"four tops\", 3 \"two tops\", and a bar for four surrounding a large communal table so the waitlist can tick up fast. We got here right at 11:30AM when the doors opened for lunch. There were already four other groups waiting ahead of us. So come early. I'd say this place is perfect for groups of four our less unless you don't mind splitting up due to the limited amount of tables and the usually long wait times during peak hours. I've sat at the communal table a few times with larger groups but it can sometimes be awkward for me.   I order the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen with garlic and mild spice. This bowl is served with thick noodles, a creamy broth, with fried garlic chips and a drizzle of garlic oil and chili oil. They bring whole pealed garlic cloves and a garlic press to the table to smash the garlic right into the ramen. This is my favorite bowl for sure. The other ramen bowl they offer which is also very good is the Vegetable Soup Ramen which is served with a clear broth and thin buckwheat noodles.   My friend and cousin ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen and both thought it was so so good. As I mentioned earlier, one said it was the best she's ever had.   Just 10 min away from Las Vegas Blvd, it's worth a trip from locals and visitors alike.",

    "text": "It annoys me to have to write this review because I love Jinya and have been a fan of their ramen for years but my last experience there demands sharing. I placed a To-Go order at 10pm for the most popular dish, the Spicy Chicken Ramen. I was surprised to hear the hostess mention a 30 to 35 minute wait time over the phone for a to-go meal that shouldn't take more than a few minutes to prepare. Regardless, I went ahead and placed the order. With the intent to give the restaurant more than enough time to get through a busy time and have my meal ready, I showed up at the restaurant at 10:45pm. However, even at that time I was told by the nonchalant hostess it would be an additional 5 to 10 minutes as my meal was still in the process of being prepared. Finally, at 11:15pm, 30 minutes after getting there, the most basic to-go order of the most popular menu item was ready for pickup. I refuse to believe it took over an hour to make something that should come out within minutes. From my perspective and from the many previous times being there, it seemed like the hostess completely disregarded my order until I showed up at the restaurant and even then she didn't make an effort to prioritize the making of my food. A lackadaisical effort as such is definitely not the way to ensure the loyalty of repeat customers.",

    "text": "I would like to consider myself as an aficionado when it comes to ramen. Jinya wiggled itself into my top 5 ramen house favorites, to include restaurants I visited in San Francisco, NYC, Hawaii and Japan. The taste challenge begins with the precursor and then the house specialty ramen. For appetizers, we started with the tempura Brussels sprouts, Jinya pork bun and gyoza.  To my astonishment, the Brussels sprouts were delicious and a dish you can't find in other ramen houses. As for the other two appetizers, a definite reorder on my next visit. Which brings me to the house special, Jinya black Tonkatsu ramen with thin noodles. The hearty bowl came with a two pork slices, seasoned egg, nori and garlic flakes. The richness of broth matched well with the thin noodles. However, I would have loved it more if the broth was a little hotter.  Thus the 4 star rating. Otherwise, it was an enjoyable experience and can't wait for my next visit to Las Vegas",

I give my stars for its very hip and local aesthetic, tasty food with vegan choices and drinks, and its fancy toilet (I'm totally not kidding here).  I say come here if you have time to spare to wait, and not in a rush. Dinner time is really busy and if you have 3+ people,  its definitely a wait.Lunch time is pretty tame however. There is a good variety of food on the menu, so you can have salads, tofu, fried chicken, rice with curry, and of course ramen. Ramen here is a little salty here for my tastebuds, but the broth is quite good and thick.  The fried or karage chicken is defnitely a dish to try when you're here.  Some things I have noticed is that, spoons aren't a given, you have to ask for them now. Might not be an issue if you drink from the bowl though! Service was a miss for me sadly. Although staff was friendly, there was mix ups in our orders and some time for our orders to come out. But hey! Might have been an off day.  Definitely give the place a try, I'll look forward to this Jinya's improvement next time round.",

    "text": "I keep returning to jinya because I love their ramen so much!  But unfortunately I keep getting really unkind servers. I actually nudged my boyfriend and I asked him if we tip okay and he said we did. My friends had the same server in which they tip 20% everywhere they go - and terrible experience to the point they don't even go back anymore.   I've had a tall white kid with blonde hair and we had to flag him down for anything we needed and he would come by and literally drop them on the table and quickly leave. I watched as he did that to multiple tables. Then there's a chick with glasses and light skinned, and for some reason she has a really bad attitude all the time. She brought us our ramen for our server and I asked her for two spoons because our table didn't have any, and she said yes and I watched her go straight for a pitcher of water to fill up other tables and then she kept looking over at me and I got up from my table and walked over to ask for spoons which were right behind her and she said \"yeah in just a minute.\" And continued to not do anything. 15 minutes go by and my boyfriend got up and went to the same lil station and asked a different person and he got our spoons.. It's not only that time but every time, even if I just have a question she kind of looks at me like \"uh.\" And I don't understand.. if I ever go back, I will make it clear not to have her near me again. I was pretty irritated and hungry and that almost pissed me off enough to ask her what's the deal but I have to remember to be nice and have consideration for others if they're having a bad day but damn. I've also had this OTHER girl who got irritated that I got a ramen with something I didn't ask her for but I wasn't asking for a remake, she was just forcing that upon me and I still paid for the type of soup I didn't ask for, haha.  I work in a restaurant myself and my job is to bring a smile to the table and welcome everyone to continue to help our business grow but I can't be rude to someone when I have no reasoning. It's frustrating in a faced paced place but I'm kind. As everyone should be.   Maybe I'll start doing To go orders instead. Or I'll go to the other ramen place by the CSN Charleston Campus.",

    "text": "I originally wanted to give this place 2 stars, but considering how the service was actually decent and the overall establishment was clean, I opted for 3 stars instead. For a small location, Jinya is quite nicely decorated--it is very hip, modern and trendy. The fact that Jinya is also one of the only ramen places in Las Vegas that is open until 3 am also makes it a plus. I can definitely see this restaurant being the perfect joint for late night dates, large group gatherings and after work hang out. The service here is also very good. The food comes out fast and the servers are very attentive. Now, that being said, the quality of food itself is a completely different story.  When my boyfriend and I went to Jinya, we both tried the tonkotsu ramen. I ordered the Tonkotsu Black (pork broth, pork char siu, nori, garlic chips, thin noodles) and my boyfriend ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy (pork broth, pork char siu, bean sprouts, thick noodles). For an average of $11 per bowl, the ramen was nothing out of the ordinary that you couldn't get some where else like at Monta or Sora. The tonkotsu broth itself was one of the heaviest broth that I have ever tasted in ramen. As soon as it was in my mouth, I could taste the richness of the broth and literally feel a thick layer of butter/fat coat the top of my tongue and mouth. While I understand that ramen joints typically enhance the savory taste of the broth with ingredients such as fat and butter, however, the broth at Jinya was so rich that it made the entire dish too overwhelming to finish. It almost felt as if I was consuming pure fat, butter and oil mixed with salt.   You know you ate some serious heavy sh**t when you can still taste the fat coat your tongue and the back of your throat several hours later.   I'm normally the type of person with a very strong stomach. However, that night when I got home, I felt very sick with heartburn.  While I don't expect to walk into a ramen place coming out feeling detoxed, because let's face it-- ramen is usually an indulgence of umami and flavors.. But, I have never experienced such a heaviness feeling from other ramen places like I do from Jinya. I guess there is such a thing as too much richness-- a concept I usually don't mind. But here, I feel like it's overboard. Not to say that it's not worth giving this place a second try.. but if I ever go back, I would never order the tonkotsu ramen again.",

All of the wait staff I've had were girls and I've never seen a guy on the floor yet, and are mostly cute. The workers at the counter yell out \"ITTERASSHAI!\"(\"Welcome\" in Japanese\"), and the server was spot-on and attentive when it came to taking the order.  Now came the food, the food was alright. Nothing spectacular in comparison to the other ramens I've had over at Miso-ya and Sora. The broth is a lot lighter, which a lot of people might like and appreciate more than me who is a fan of heavier-flavored broths and giant pieces of tender char-siu :,,: Don't get me wrong though, the pork was delicious and tender, but the pieces were much more generous over at Sora.   In this highly competitive, emerging market of Ramen and Japanese food in Vegas, Jinya stood out with its appeal rather than amazing food. I enjoy eye-candy myself though.",

Growing up in Japan and eating ramen frequently from different shops, I like to say that I'm pretty particular when it comes to ramen.   I had the karaage ramen. It was definitely different from what I'd usually have but it was either ramen and karaage or karaage ramen. I chose the latter obviously. I also had them add am egg and corn to my ramen which is a little extra in cost but that's typical from ramen joints. The chicken soaked up some of the broth which added extra flavor to the chicken. It still had somewhat of a crispy outside and still was good with beer. Oh! If you didn't know already karaage in Japan is usually eaten with beer. It's like the Japanese equivalent to bar food. The ramen was perfect as far as not being too soft or too hard which is always a plus! I'm sure if you ask they'll make it the way you like it but I like that perfect in between.   I forgot how much my bill was but it was exactly as I expected as far as cost to quality/service. The service was spot on and I wasn't bothered too much or too little.   I can't wait to go back and try other things!",

    "text": "Well, well, well  A new contender in the ramen food scene of Las Vegas.  I remember coming back from Japan and there were none in Las Vegas that could even rate a zero on the rating to japan.  I used to be one of the firsts requesting Ramen in Vegas I think I might have been the first to review a new ramen in Vegas.  I was one of the firsts asking for authentic Ramen, over the years it has turned into a Vegas experience.   Ramen in this town has grown from going to a side bar that has the reputation of a good ramen to some of the best ramen on the west coast.  I no longer have to drive to LA to have Ramen.  Jinya again exceeds expectations of a ramen restaurant.  This place kind of resets the bar of Ramen in this town.  There are others who have held the bar for so long but have become lax.  Still good but not as good as this, sad to say but I feel fame will make you relax too much.    We put our name in and waited about 30 minutes.  Not bad for good Ramen in Vegas.  we were asked if a small table was ok (of course) sat and were explained the menu.    I recommend getting the Thick noodles, I was fine with normal noodles but my man really likes the thicker noodles.  The normal noodles are quite thin.  We got the Jinya Tonkostso Black, we added Nori, Corn, fresh garlic and seasoned egg.  I really wanted some apps but it was only us 2.  We got our food and feasted, I have never had a egg this good.  I have made this claim before but every time I make this claim it has never been this good. I relished this egg...  I would go back for the Tonkostso Black any day.  This Ramen is the best at this point, Monta Ramen and Ramen Sora look out you have a new player in town!  I think Jinya might take over in my opinion!   I will go back and i will ask for more, I might ask for extra.  I will for sure get more of the Jinya Tonkostso Black.  I can t wait to try some sides.  Yummy!!!",

Tried using the gyoza sauce and hot sauce on the table but nothing worked. It might have been better if they provided a simple tempura sauce.  The ramen was average at best.

    "text": "I came to Jinya because I've heard so much hype about it and I had to check it out! So I went to check it out and the wait was about 15 minutes. We had a couple groups in front of us which made me more excited to try the food. When we were seated a male popped out of a corner and asked us if we would like water and at first I didn't realize he was an employee because of how he just popped up randomly. He was very kind though. I ordered the Kara Men and it was so good!!! But it stopped being good when I found a hair in it! I was very upset about it and lost my appetite to continue. I also had a Pork Chashu bowl so I just continued to eat that which was really good. Overall the food and service was good but I was just upset about the hair.",

    "text": "VERY DISAPPOINTED! This was my go to spot over Monta. I constantly raved about this place to my local and out of state friends & families. But after my most recent incident @ Jinya, I will no longer dine nor recommend this place to my friends & families.  Incident occurred on 12/18/16 @ 11:40pm on a busy night. I decided to order takeout after work since I needed comfort food bc I was sick. I waited at the host desk and stood in front of Christina, the host, and looked at her and she did not greet me even after exchanging eye contact. Instead she looked at me. Me as a customer, had to make the first initiative and asked Christina if I could see a takeout menu. She handed it to me & I stood in front of her while I looked at the menu for a good 5 minutes. I then proceeded and asked her if their is a combo meal that I could order to go and she replied yes. I continue to tell her my order and she responds, \"I'm sorry we are not taking any take orders at the moment because it is busy\".  I responded with, \"For future references, please put a sign at the front door to notify your customers that you are not accepting take out orders during busy hours\" as a common courtesy and to save your customers time. I asked to speak with the shift manager for the night, Adam. I also informed Adam that at a professional standpoint put a sign at the entrance as common courtesy. He then then told me that, \"THEY ARE TAKING ORDERS DURING BUSY HOURS ITS JUST THAT THERE IS A 30 MINUTE WAIT\". I told Adam that I was told differently by Christina that you guys are not taking orders. He apologized for the mistake, BUT I WAS AT THE POINT OF AGGRAVATION AND NO LONGER WANTED TO CONTINUE TO BE A CUSTOMER OF JINYA BECAUSE:  1) CHRISTINA THE HOST WAS NOT FRIENDLY NOR DID SHE GREET ME 2) I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR A TAKEOUT MENU TO ORDER TAKEOUT. INSTEAD OF NOTIFYING ME BEFOREHAND ABOUT NOT ACCEPTING TAKEOUT ORDERS, SHE HANDS ME THE MENU 3) I CONTINUE TO ASK IF TAKEOUT ORDERS COME WITH A COMBO MEAL AND SHE REPLIES \"YES\" & STILL FAILS TO TELL ME THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTING TAKEOUT ORDERS 4) THE TOPPING ON THE CAKE IS HOW SHE MISINFORMED ME ABOUT NO TAKEOUT ORDERS, BC ACCORDING TO THE SHIFT MANAGER ADAM, ITS A 30 MINUTE WAIT  I'm a very patient person. I know a lot about patience from being a special needs mom with a medically fragile child. So it has taught me to take things with a grain of salt. If I was notified before hand the moment I asked for a takeout menu that there will be a 30 minute wait. I would have been perfectly fine with it. But unfortunately, your host Christina was unprofessional! She needs to be trained to greet your customers, especially if they are standing at the host desk directly in front of her. Train her to inform her customers before hand with the correct information. Thanks to her I will no longer dine nor recommend this place.",

Also, we ordered a combo that comes with Ramen, salad , and gyoza but the only thing came out was the ramen so again we had to ask someone other server to get our salad and gyoza. We ask her it's happy  hour right? She said \"i dont know what time is it ?\" wth... She ruined our appetite tonight for sure !  Overall food was ok. Not as good as tge first time we went",

Things on the menu no longer offer everything they used to have. I went in Monday night 10:00PM and was told that they do not have a happy hour when it was sitting on our table that specified 3-5PM & 10-12PM. The happy hour menu barely had any items on it as most were taken off and they covered it with \"DISCONTINUED.\" I've also noticed that they do not have sushi rolls on their menu anymore. Even though on their website still listed a wider selection of items that I looked forward to enjoy, but feel disappointed when stepping inside.   Hope that they will fix the menu back to be better.",

I'm very particular about ramen noodles and I have yet to be disappointed by the handmade noodles here. The firmness is good, never soggy, and the ramen is rarely left on the counter to cool and served as soon as they are done (ramen noodles have a time limit!!)   Gyoza is a must have accompaniment when it comes to ramen and the gyoza here is also quite good. Crispy outside, juicy meat filling.   This time around I had the chicken ramen - a very 'assari' flavor (light broth) and the chicken chashu is very tender. I really liked the Tokyo style chicken ramen but they unfortunately removed it with the new menu.   I didn't have the panna cotta this time around but I've had it a couple times in the past. The dessert itself is not super outstanding, but the cookie cubes that accompany the panna cotta adds a great contrast that I enjoy. If you have room after your meal I'd say it's worth trying!   There is often a wait but definitely worth it. A couple of the servers can sometimes be brash with the handling of dishes when serving/removing from table and filling waters.",

Which is excellent if you're starving.  The ambiance was great. Love the decor, the music, and the overall vibes.  We had:  Gyoza - super yummy. They have the sauce on the table which was very garlicy and delicious.  JINYA Dynamite - Meh. I wasn't too much of a fan.  JINYA #2 - I loved it. Everything but the dried seaweed. I should have asked for it without. Because I hate seaweed. The broth for the ramen is very good. I've had a bit better other places, but it was very tasty.  Tonkotsu Spicy - Very good. Nice and perfectly spicy.   Everything here was very good. We will definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "It's a hip restaurant with ambient lighting, seats at the ramen bar, communal seating in the center, or booths along the edges. Seats around 50 max, and not great for big groups (like 6 or more).   The ramen was good, very flavorful and rich broth. I got the jinya tonkotsu black, and it's a pork and chicken broth that wasn't too oily like some ramen broths can get. The only complaint I had was that I got a ton of noodles but not enough broth. Also, the char siu pork wasn't as fatty as I'd like, and it was cut into thin flat strips (I like thicker cuts). It did fall apart easily though, showing it was slow cooked for a long time. The whole egg was perfectly cooked (soft yolk inside but not runny).   My party got the fried shrimp balls which were the absolute best I've ever had!! The fried crust had just a touch of sweetness (tasted like cane sugar?) & nuts, the shrimp paste inside was a mix of minced shrimp and chopped shrimp, so there were larger pieces of shrimp in there. there was also some of the spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce in the shrimp ball too, making it super moist and delicious.   We also got the tempura Brussels sprouts which was a miss. Had a touch of black truffle oil & salt, but it didn't come with the typical tempura dipping sauce which I like. I didn't like the taste of black truffle oil with the Brussels sprouts. truffle oil already has an almost bitter, savory taste and Brussels sprouts do too, so it was a bit too much for me.   Four stars was mainly because the music was too loud! The bass was pounding away and I had to semi shout to chat with the others I was eating with. It was so annoying that we were in and out in 35 minutes, and didn't really get to sit and savor everything.   Service was friendly. The women's bathroom was super high tech Japanese. flushing the toilet takes some time because I had to figure out how to flush it. You flush it by pressing a tiny round button on the side of the bowl. I don't like touching toilets (I usually flush by pressing my foot down on the flushing handle), so this was gross for me. But I appreciated the super high tech toilet, just too bad it's not in my home for me to personally enjoy (tmi!)",

    "text": "I went and had ramen here about a week ago. I am bias to the one in Studio City on Ventura and decided to try this one.  I have to say that I was not disappointed. There wasn't much of a wait on a Friday night. For a table of four we waited around 20 minutes. You could tell that the staff is very attentive but does their best to clear out and bus the tables as soon as they can for quick turnarounds.  Started off with the gyoza. They did a pretty good. Not too oily and the gyoza had a nice crisp side to it and the wrapper was still soft and chewy on the other side. They have premade sauce for the gyoza. I tend to like mine a little spicy so all I did was ask for chili oil.  I had the chicken wonton ramen. I have to say I am a fan of the more traditional places where you order Ramen and depending on what you order all the extras are included. You have to pay for everything outside of the noodles at this place. If you want an egg, which I added, it comes at a price. I also added the butter and Green onions. Be sure to ask for the fresh garlic. They hand you a jar of peeled garlic along with a garlic press. Might as will get all the freebies that you can.  The noodles were cooked well and the broth was flavorful. All in all a good experience and was on par with the studio city location.",

There were plenty of options on the menu to choose from and our waiter was very willing to answer questions and help. The only downside to this place is the size. It's a small restaurant and wait times are longer for bigger parties. So be prepared to wait or be open to sitting at their communal table.",

    "text": "The ramen broth here is excellent!  Their menu offers many different broth and spice combinations to highlight all their flavors; it's not just a broth with however many sides you want to throw in.   Their tonkotsu broth is SUPER thick which shows how much fat and flavor the chefs were able to cook into the broth. My favorite variation was the tonkotsu black which is the basic broth topped with a black garlic oil and some chili paste. The tonkotsu white is a mix of tonkotsu broth and chicken broth. It's much soupier with a lighter (but still amazing) flavor. There is seriously so much to choose from, so their ramen soups can satisfy anyone's palette.   My must have is the takoyaki. It has such a creamy texture on the inside and they are generous with the octopus. Most other takoyaki that I've tried have a strong artificial ginger flavor in their sauce. This stuff tasted like the real deal! The ginger flavor here was subtle and exactly what I want when enjoying takoyaki. Instead of covering the takoyaki with Japanese mayonnaise, the balls are placed on a bed of egg salad. It was such an interesting combination. It added to the creaminess and I found myself eating every last bite of the salad.    The wait here can be long but it's well worth it! This place is good to go solo. They have a bar and a huge community table so dining alone will get you to a table much quicker.   I enjoyed everything I ate at Jinya Ramen and I can't wait to be back for more!",

This is not a traditional ramen place by any means but I think that's a good thing. Their broth is spectacular. I ordered the Black Tonkatsu Ramen and it had an excellent balance of tasty and smooth. Everything else in the ramen was balanced perfectly. You can really tell (taste) the craft behind the dish.  Be wary though as this place will probably always have a long waiting line. Good sign of great food, bad if you're impatient. The place has a big center table that I think they can get rid off to make space for more chairs. It is a bit stuffy on the inside but you came for the ramen, not to chill.   If you don't like to wait, I see them do \"to-go\" orders. Lifehack.   Food 5/5 Venue 4/5 Price 5/5 Service 5/5",

It's the absolute perfect food for rainy & gloomy days! Packed with flavor and so filling!   They also offer a great happy hour for small bites (ramen not included) daily from 3-5 and 10-midnight.

I waited about 20-30 minutes for a table for 2 on Sunday at around 1pm.   I went with my friends recommendation and ordered the Sprouting Up Ramen. However, I made the mistake of replacing the pork chashu with pork soboro. The pork soboro is really well seasoned and would taste great with rice because it's on the salty end. However, adding the soboro to an already salty ramen made my broth extremely salty. The brussel sprouts were unique and cooked well, but I think I'm definitely more of a tradition ramen fan.   We also ordered the takoyaki, which was well worth the $6. The appetizer comes with 6 octopus balls on a bed of crushed hard boiled eggs covered with japanese mayo, sauce, green onions, and bonito flakes. The takoyaki was delicious and I would come back to Jinya just to eat them again.",

They're a new Chef's special appetizer.  Special indeed!  For our ramens, we requested Cha cha for garlic lovers, and Karaage chicken which was another Chef's special.  No regrets!  They were ramen-liciously perfect and different.  Broth flavor was nice.  Then the ingredients in the soup added yet more great flavor.  And the noodles are either regular or fat, good texture too.  We still look like out of towners, so I'm not sure if that's why we received such attentive service.  But we loved it.  If that's the case everyone should look like an out of towner.  And you'll want to come in during their happy hours cuz they have TWO happy hour slots.  This restaurant is clean, industrial modern design - very sleek.  Table layout is well planned especially for how the servers need to move about.  It's a tiny space, but due to the floor plan and high ceilings it does not feel cramped.  They play cool lounge music too.  Their menu isn't overwhelming and the Chef's creations are kinds we haven't seen before.  If you're a tourist in Las Vegas, and love ramen and creative fusion, you'll want to bookmark this restaurant.  I have to give 5 stars!  Ambience, lounge music, clean and simple but classy chill atmosphere, great food, serves unique alcohol, two happy hours, splendid service...  P.S. Try their panna cotta - creamy not too sweet and may cure a pouting face.",

Sounds like all the other reviews were on point regarding the cold food. The service was nice enough but you can tell the restaurant is about quantity and not quality. Too bad we won't be coming back to JINYA.",

They took the time to explain the menu and were super nice throughout  the entire meal.   The gyoza app was delicious. The wrap had a nice texture. Not to thick.  Not too thin. The filing was tasty. The fried chicken wings were tasty. A little heavy for me but a nice size app. The octopus balls were pretty good. Octopus was tender.   I got the chicken ramen. It was amazing. Not too salty but very rich in flavor. The noodles were cooked great. There were two slices of chicken that were ok. You get free fresh garlic, as much as you want. I also got the broccoli add on which is steamed and serve in the side.   The ramen was great, highly recommend.",

I'm always full, and so happy with the food.   A couple times I've had horrible luck with service ... one time my waitress was just down right dismissive and rude, I can say I am a polite person and always respect staff wherever I dine/spend my time. This specific time I ended up requesting a new waitress and everything was fine.   Another more recent occasion that disappointed me was when I ordered some take out. I was having issues with their phone number, it was saying it was disconnected for a while, but eventually I got through, much to my relief    I ordered and was told it would take about 20 minutes. I went in 15 minutes later and the young woman at the front podium told me it would be another 20 minutes. I was a little surprised.   Anyways I step out for a couple minutes and come back sooner than she said in hopes maybe it was ready. I go inside and I see my order bagged up and sitting on the shelf ready to go, yay! I asked the woman if my food was ready and she again told me no it would take longer, not bothering to check if the food that was ready was even mine.    Anyways 10 minutes goes by she finally looks at the tag/receipt on the bag and she called my name, and was like oh it's ready now. She acted as if I hadn't been standing there for almost 15 minutes staring at the food. I was annoyed, I could have been home eating it by then. And it wasn't super busy either. She was barely applying herself. I  found it rather insulting too cause she didn't care at all. I'll be back because I love the food, but the staff can sometimes be a tad rude.",

Food was delicious and j especially like that you can get a second helping of noodles to finish the bowl off as needed. Also enjoyed the spinach noodle option though not sure if it really better for you or just sounds like it..lol  This location is a tad confusing, at least for being my first time. First off was trying to find the front door, lol, but I'll take the blame on that one. The lady who sat us down asked if we prefer a table, a booth, or the \"community table\" in the center. We asked for a booth, she then sat us at a table. Not a huge deal but when I nicely asked if we could have a booth she seemed very annoyed and then allowed us to move. No idea why this was annoying because although they were pretty busy there were several of each available & clean.  Once sat, they have kind of a \"roaming server\" I will call him.. we'll call him \"Mr. Friendly\". He greats you, gets your order, then basically constantly walks around and chats and helps people. He kept our glasses full and plates warm so I can't complain, just a little different. Considering how busy they were he honestly did an impressive job and was helpful for me picking out a dish, though I will admit the place could probably benefit from a second \"Mr. Friendly\" so give him a little more time with each guest. Regardless, cool concept and he did a great job.  The ramen bowl I got was delicious and made to order, I wish it had more noodles to start but a couple bucks for a noodle refill was well worth it.  The entire experience was really good and I would definitely go back here. Place was busy but fast, very upbeat and noisy but in a good way, and feels upscale. Good date spot if you're keeping it casual but don't want to be a cheapskate. Definitely not a quiet/romantic place.  Only reason for the -1 Star is because of the greeter/hostess' poor attitude. She was our cashier as well by the way and just seemed very \"put off\" by having to work that day I guess.   Will definitely return. Cheers!",

    "text": "This ramen place sucks for 2 reasons: first is the flavor and the second is the attention to detail from the staff. I've had Tonkotsu Black here before and I never had any issues with it in the pass, but today the broth tasted like water. Where is the flavor? I want my ramen to have that rich and creamy flavor like you would get at Ramen Sora. I honestly know for a fact I rather eat at Ramen Sora or make Top Ramen at home because it's way better than JINYA Ramen.   The second reason why I was disappointed at JINYA Ramen is because their staff lacks attention to detail. When I ordered my Tonkotsu Black - I ordered extra seasoned egg, pork, and substitute thin noodles for thick noodles. When the server brought my ramen for the first time, I told them they messed up my order because they forgot to switch out the thin noodles for thick noodles (no big deal). But the second time they came around to replace my first ramen bowl the staff still messed up, but this time they forgot to add the extra pork that I ordered. Not to mention the first ramen bowl that I had there was 3 seaweeds, but when they came back to replace my bowl they gave me 2 seaweeds instead of 3. So which one is it? Is it 3 or 2 seaweeds per Tonkotsu Black?   Needless to say I won't be coming to this ramen place EVER again. The bottom line is they need to work on their flavor for their ramen and the staff needs to pay attention to detail when it comes to their customers.",

We got there gave them our name and it was pretty fast when we got called I asked the manager if we choose to wait how long do you think it would it be he reached out his hand and said whenever these people are done eating. I was so turned off by that response I wanted to walk out!!!! Are you serious did he really just say that?!?! So we sat at the counter and a couple of times the cooks almost knocked the bowls over that were on display. The lady who was our server  wasn't friendly at all we told her it's our first time she gave us a blank stare so I asked what's the most popular and she said spicy chicken ramen or Black Tonkatsu. We both ordered the black Tonkatsu the meat was alright only 2 pieces for the price isn't worth it to me. The gyoza was good but I can order that anywhere honestly. I probably will not return the ramen wasn't that good and the service was horrible.",

He responded no but they are way behind!  The food is nothing special just ramen soup that you get in 5 packs for one dollar with some green onions chopped on top of it and a bit of meat or pork but the atmosphere was happy and fun.

Doing the combo with the Fried Chicken or the California Rolls, you just can't go wrong and have nothing bad to say but yummy! The Takoyaki balls and steam pork bun is also a very good treat! One of the best Ramen places to go and they close at 3am, that's always a plus when the other Ramen places are almost all closed by then. Service all the time is always very attentive and courteous. Cool atmosphere but just have to wait for a booth sometimes if you don't want to be slurping next to a total stranger on the king size table in the middle of the restaurant.",

We had ditched our usual Ramen house, wanting to try it here due to the good reviews we've heard about this place. However, the wait time took forever even though we were the third one on the waiting list. Those before us were seated along with plenty more that came after us even though there were plenty of seats that could accommodate my family of six.      When we were finally seated, we were placed on a big table with other customers that made my family sit away from us. I requested to be seated on adjacent booths so at least that way, my family would be closer. My request was denied because it was seen as \"inconvenient\" to the hostess, because it was her job to seat the customers. This small request would require her to move us to different tables. How this small request could be seen as \"inconvenient \" is beyond me. All I asked was to be seated with my family, we were willing to give up our own seats for other parties while we occupy the smaller booths.      Denied, we sat spread apart, resulting in having to eat with our dampened moods. The food we ate was not as delicious as I heard it was, disappointed with the reviews, and the waiter kept on insisting we try the dessert despite our refusal. Also, they kept on disturbing our eating time by constantly picking up our trash, taking the dishes, and refilling our water  before the cup is even half empty! It is safe to say that my family and I will never be coming back here. Instead we will be going back to our regular Ramen house, monta.",

Other than that, the service is fast. They bring out the food as it is cooked, so you may be eating before your party (apparently I am perfectly fine with this)!

The noodles are a little thinner than I'm used to but I didn't mind as they were flavorful and taste fresh.  Broth was good, just a little kick.  Toppings are generous - usually they give you half an egg, you get a whole egg which was still a little runny in the middle just how I like it.  The pork was cooked perfectly, buttery and soft!

    "text": "Short: Lacked flavor, but good place.  Long:  Arrived here after noon on a Friday. Not the best area for a ramen shop, and not that many people in (though I've been to better ramen shops with less people). Service was a bit off as the girl didn't know how to welcome a guest in Japanese (said  rather than  which was kind of funny). Menu is rather typical for a shop specializing in tonkotsu ramen. Black tonkotsu ramen with extras being their specialty so I ordered that ($11). Food came out rather quick for being a little busy (not as quick as Monta roman when it's not busy though).  When I say the food lacked flavor, I do mean it. I've been to Monta (one of the best restaurants in Vegas, IMO), Hiromaru and Fukamimi that all do tonkotsu ramen, and each have their cravats. For Jinya, the whole bowl just lacked that strong punch of flavor you should get from tonkotsu. The chashu pork was nice, but wasn't seasoned enough and lacked flavor. The toppings were the usual deal. But the biggest let down was the soup broth just did not have a strong richness to it. In fact, I think it's thickened with corn starch to help it become thicker rather than letting the richness of the broth support it. Other than that, nothing really stood out.   Is it terrible? No. And there's many other things on the menu that people might like.   But for a ramen shop, there's a good list of better places out there like Monta, Hiromaru, Fukamimi, and Sora. I recommend those first.",

Comboed it with 4 pc gyoza and curry rice bowl with salads.  Salad came first. Salad is spot on.  The gyoza and the curry rice came next. This was already 11 dollars. This was not worth it but the taste is good but I feel I can get the same thing somewhere else for a better price.  Now the Ramen. Took while to come out and we waited and waited while we see our friends take theirs to their stomachs. But anyways, here we go.  The charsui was plain. Seems like it wasn't marinated for a day or 2 like most traditional Japanese charsui are made. The tops are great and presentation of the Ramen is great. Taste of the broth is good. It is up to participate of what a Tonkotsu Ramen is.  My bottom line is that this is a regular ramen bar if you want your ramen fix. The ambiance and presentation of the food is what's attracting the customers. As for the pure taste it is great, right between good and excellent/super.",

The first thing I noticed was how fatty and thick their soup was. Granted, ramen is supposed to be fatty and thick so it definitely accomplished that! But I got full too fast and couldn't enjoy much if anything else. Their chicken wings were good and crispy. But the #1 item for me was their almond tofu pudding. It was so light and refreshing!! I would come back just for that! Its a must try!",

After our ramen we had to use the restroom. The ladies room is awesome. They have this really fancy toilet that has a seat warmer. My friend saw that their were other functions on this toilet, upon checking it out we discovered we could get a free colonic!!! HOW AWESOME IS THAT? Thank you Jinya for the awesome food as well as cleaning my friend out. We really appreciate it!!!",

I also liked that they have other things like wings, sweet potato fries, etc. I would totally give it a five star for the food, but the place is a little small which causes the wait to be long. We had to end up sitting at the huge table in the middle with strangers which didn't make for private convo. We could have waited another 20 mins for a table but we were hungry. Also I chose this place too because of the review of the tempura Brussel sprouts and they didn't have any when I went. Shame.",

    "text": "Tried an order of the crispy chicken, seriously disappointed, then opted for the spicy chicken jinya (medium heat) and it was pretty tasty! However it was a bit pricy and I thought it was a bit steep to pay over $20 for a bowl of ramen and a plate of crispy chicken that really wasn't all that great. But, I know better next time. Stick with the authentic dishes! :D Also, side note. When I reordered for the jinya, I didn't get my food until everyone in my party was completely done eating. (It sucks being the last person still eating, and eating a full bowl of ramen!) And, every other random guest in the place, even the ones that came in, sat down, AND ordered after me, got their food before I did. Literally, every single guest was served before I was.... That was a HUGE let down. I'm not one to pester the servers but unfortunately, I had to do just that to make sure they knew I had been waiting far past a reasonable time.",

We had the vegetable ramen--deep flavor variety of veggies, and delicious thin noodles; the takoyaki-creamy and over-the-top (not my favorite, but other members of my group enjoyed it); the Dynamite roll--of which I didn't partake; and the tempura Brussels sprouts--I already love Brussels sprouts but these were delicious! The best thing, though, was the kid's meal. I mean, I would have ordered it for myself. It was lots of little bites of chashu pork, crispy chicken, salad, an orange, and fries. It also came with a small bowl of ramen and an amazing custard dessert. Here's the kicker, we paid less than $50 (including a Sapporo). That may not impress you, but for the amount of quality food we ate, I consider it a bargain!",

    "text": "When there was a JINYA in Costa Mesa, CA years ago - I went there SO much, the workers started calling me Van-chan. I would like to imagine that I was one of their favorite customers. I was absolutely devastated when they closed down the Costa Mesa location. While I was in Vegas, I stayed at Palms Place and I was so close to JINYA, I knew I had to go back for that delicious tonkatsu broth that lingers to my soul!!   I came about 10 minutes after they opened and the restaurant was already half full. The place was packed by the time I was ready to order!!  I had the JINYA Tonkotsu Black ($12) which has their heavenly pork broth, thin noodles, pork cha shu, seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic aioli, fried onion and spicy sauce. I actually asked them to make this spicy for me since I liked the ingredients in this bowl better than the Tonkotsu Spicy Ramen. I made my dish a combo (additional $4.20) for 4 piece gyoza and salad.   The person next to me ordered their combo after me but they received their salad first. I got my salad a while after and I was less than impressed. The gyozas were pretty good but definitely on the smaller side. I do not recommend the combination upgrade.   My JINYA Tonkotsu Black was almost as impressive as I remembered. The broth was PERFECT and the seasoned egg leaves my heart fluttering. The only thing that I wasn't in love with was their cha shu. Hopefully I went on an off day because the cha shu was tough and not as flavorful as I remembered.   I also splurged while I was on vacation mode for their Panna Cotta ($3.50). This is one of my all time favorite desserts and I loved the panna cotta itself but I have no clue why they threw ice cream on top of it. The sweetness of the ice cream over powered the delicate panna cotta. This panna cotta had the perfect consistency and I feel like they downgraded the product as a whole by throwing on a scoop of ice cream.   The conclusion is that you should come here for the ramen, but nothing else. Their service can really improve too. I came and ordered because the customer next to me but they gave him his identical order before I got my stuff. And also there was this annoying issue where at first they ran out of the pork broth and only had the chicken broth. By the time their tonkotsu broth was ready, the waitress came to inform the customer next to me and walked off. I had to flag her down to change my broth to the default tonkotsu broth. I would have been less than satisfied with chicken broth if the one I actually want is available.",

    "text": "Jinya was first introduced to me in LA when my friends and I were on the hunt for ramen after a long day at Universal Studios. Huge wait out there but we quickly realized how worth it was. For me, vegetarian ramen speaks for itself. I thought this was going to be a one time ordeal falling in love while on vacation and having to wait years before eating it again..... then Jinya Vegas was before my eyes shortly after I moved here. Life made!  I had the spicy creamy vegan ramen then and I came to the Vegas location with high hopes for it to knock my socks off again. It did just that! I added a soft boiled egg and mushrooms to my ramen and we shared edamame on the side. We all got ramune which has become my guilty pleasure.   Our server was super helpful in explaining the menu to my girlfriends who were there for the first time. She noted which of the condiments were vegetarian since a friend and I are vegetarian. I suck at eating ramen in the sense that I eat all the broth before i get to my noodles so she even offered me extra broth to go and I was able to make two servings of my one bowl of ramen.   Ambiance is hipster-esque. We were seated at the high top. Not my preference but was ready to eat! It's not insanely large which explains the wait. Parking is a bit of a struggle but there's a large strip mall behind the establishment.   The wait is the only inconvenience, but if that tells you anything... it's that good! No reservations, no calls. Will absolutely be frequenting it time and time again.",

    "text": "While the service at JINYA's is friendly, it's not enough to redeem itself from its subpar food, prices, and speed.  The turnaround time here was very, very slow. We came during a rush, so it was kind of expected, but it took us quite awhile to be seated despite multiple tables being open. And getting our food was painstakingly slow. We were here for an hour and a half, and that was only because we spent an hour waiting around.  The service was very friendly and apologetic, however. And while I appreciate the good customer service, I don't think it's enough to redeem the food or the prices.  I got the creamy vegan ramen. The highlight were the thick noodles, which I loved. Everything else was mediocre (the toppings) or subpar (the broth was ridiculously salty).  Three bowls of ramen and two additional toppings came to $42. Having been here a few times and considering the competition nearby, I don't think I'll be back. It just wasn't worth it, and I couldn't help but leave wholly unsatisfied and disappointed.",

This place always has a long ass freaking wait and the food isn't that special. There's tons of other ramen places in town with the same quality of food. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. And they don't take numbers down. And expect you to stand outside for an hour with no seating no nothing. Like you can take our number down so we can sit in our car and wait at least. God damn hostess is so annoying and this place is so freaking disorganized. Seriously fuck it. Then when you eat you always feel all rushed and can't even enjoy your meal cause they got a long ass wait. SHAKING MY FREAKING HEAD. WARNING: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME COMING HERE!   ***   This location is very tiny, you'd think they start making their locations bigger with the volume of customers they get but they don't. The wait was about 25 minutes for 4 on a Tuesday night. They were very very crowded, tons of people waiting. I ordered my ramen and then found out their were out of limes, so my ramen didn't really taste right. But the service is good, not exceptional.. I don't know why they didn't have an employee go to the store, from the time we sat down to the time we got our food 40 minutes went by. They seemed really disorganized last night 1/1/18. I don't know what was going on.  They should take some tips from their California locations, like the one in studio city.",

She saw the 2 kids I had with me and automatically offered high chairs which is a big plus for being attentive. It was quite busy so when our server couldn't get to us, Janey helped out.   I didn't know they had a kids meal on the menu now so that was great, it's a lot but worth the $7 since it comes with desserts for the little ones.   I had the California poke bowl, it was good but I think they added way tooo much cilantro and rice and not enough tuna and salmon.... So I won't be ordering that again.  The Tokyo curry with beef was great! Good portions between the curry and rice.   I will definitely come back since I felt really welcome by your host which doesn't happen often because of my 2 kids.",

We were hungry and ready to eat.  The location was clean, the service was fast and friendly.  They did messed up my friend's order, but promptly fixed it.    The food was good, one of the finest Ramen I had ever experienced.  High quality noodles, decent broth, and decent pork belly.  The octopus balls were okay, I was never a fan of them so I can't judge.  Everyone seemed to have enjoyed their food for sure!  The loo? Was mediocre at best.  I was really hoping for something magnificent because I heard many great things about it.  And was totally disappointed with the standard issue equipment in there.  I heard the ladies restroom was better with those fancy toilet that rinses you clean.  None for the mens.  Minus one star for lack of equality. :P Pretty clean loo with good supply of toilet paper.  Overall a decent experience, and will definitely be back when in Vegas.  I hope next time there will be a better throne in the loo waiting for me to do my business.",

This has been a bookmarked place for many months since I drove by on Flamingo and read the Yelp reviews especially from Philip T, Leonel M, Candace C.  I dropped a friend at McCarran and then made it across the Strip and here in good time.  I arrived just about 6 PM and stood there like a jerk!  One of the people waiting told me to sign the sheet on a stand.  This is the way you get \"in line.\"  The restaurant is small with about 5 seats at the bar, tables on three sides, and a large square table in the center around which there are about 20 seats for more communal dining.  Being solo, that was fine for me.  Having checked the menu in advance, I had decided not to get ramen but to concentrate on two or three of Jinya's small plates.  I ordered a Jinya bun--pork chasu with cucumber, sauce, and Jinya's kewpie mayo on a bao bun.  The sandwich was good.  I also got the smallest order--5 pieces--of crispy chicken.  What a nice breading for these chicken pieces.  Take care to let them cool a bit because the chicken is fiercely hot inside when first served.  Finally, I had asked the server if I could get a half order of takoyaki and she said they don't normally do it but she'd order it for me.  Instead of 6 pieces, I got 3 wonderfully flavored octopus rounds with a wonderful sauce.  (Thanks for the heads up, Philip!)  Rounding out the meal, I got the panna cotta for dessert.  The graham cracker squares gave a good texture to the panna cotta.  It was a good, light choice to end the meal.  When I left at about 7 PM, there was a long line.  Be prepared to wait or come earlier.  Next time I'll get ramen!",

    "text": "BEST RAMEN IN VEGAS! Not only is the food spot on, the venue itself very well decorated with a very hip feel -- nice and dim, good music and just an overall great ambiance! Definitely my pick for a casual date night, and absolutely perfect for rainy days that call for hot soup!   In terms of the food, I think what sets this place apart is the broth they use. It is full of flavor and rich without being overly salty (which apparently is in large part that they simmer their signature stock for TEN hours!). And aside from the usual pork and chicken broth, they also offer vegetarian. Their noodles are also great, which they age for THREE days to maximize their flavor.   For her: - CRISPY CHICKEN TONKOTSU RAMEN (chef's special): Chicken broth, green onions, fried onion, thin noodles (added corn & a seasoned egg -- which is a must!) - CRISPY CHICKEN: Five perfectly seasoned fried chicken pieces served with a very complimentary sauce (originally $4.95 but can be found on happy hour menu for $3 if you're lucky!)  For him:  - CHA CHA CHA (for garlic lovers!): Pork & fish broth, pork chiashu, seasoned egg, bean sprouts, chopped onion, green onion, garlic, chili powder, thick noodles.  - SALMON POKE MINI TACOS: Two of Jinya's original salmon poke in crispy wonton taco shells, with side of cilantro. (can also be found on happy hour menu!)  PRO TIP: \"Kaedama!\" aka get a noodle refill! Still have soup? For $1.60, get a hot, fresh batch of noodles to add in! :)  PRO TIP II: Happy hour menu from 3:00pm-5:00pm, and 10:00pm-12:00am.",

As with most of the ramen shops in town, this place gets crowded quickly and you have to be patient while waiting to be seated.  Other than that, JINYA is solid as a rock.  I am a fan of their Tonkotsu Black Ramen as well as the Wonton Chicken Ramen, which I just discovered on my last visit.    And I always order the thick noodles with their scrumptious waviness; if you want these type of noodles, make sure you specify when you place your order.  As usual, I prefer to sit at the bar if available, but probably not feasible if you're with more than two other people.   If you don't want ramen, there are salads, small plates, mini tacos, and rice bowls available.  The comfort food I crave especially when winter hits, come here to get some noodles and have a slurping good time.",

I was hankering for a bowl of ramen while I was out in Vegas, and luckily this place was there. Upon arriving, we saw that the parking lot was full and that the restaurant itself was pretty busy - always a good sign. We put a name down for a table and we waited, which made us crave the ramen and made us much more excited for our meal. We had great service from the moment we walked into the restaurant up until the moment we walked out. I had a bowl of the Jinya Tonkotsu Black and my companions had the Spicy Chicken Ramen, Jinya Chicken Ramen, and the Wonton Chicken Ramen. All of the bowls of ramen were delicious and had great tasting broth. We definitely were very happy with our meals. We also had two servings of the Takoyaki which were the perfect accompaniments to our bowls of ramen. I hope to come into another Jinya location since this place was great. I am very surprised with the quality of the ramen that we got here, and I look forward to seeing another Jinya location. The restaurant itself was very stylish, clean, and had a dark setting. The restaurant was busy, but the service did not suffer due to this.",

Not surprising, the place was quite busy when I arrived at 1:30am, but it didn't take long to get seated.  As much as I wanted to get their Black Tonkotsu Ramen that I've had before and enjoyed, I was really curious about their Jinya Chicken Ramen when I saw it on the menu.  Jinya Chicken Ramen -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2hI4iMy&s=c6eacefc39e6e13aec29a14ce6dd2363e44f44398731f912ad69b8fbea08e809\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2hI4iMy</a> The Chicken Ramen was delicious!  The Chicken \"Chashu\" were thin slices of chicken breast that were moist and tender and actually melted in my mouth with the soup.  I was not expecting that and it was a welcome surprise for me.   I definitely would order this again!  Unfortunately that night I was only hungry enough for a bowl of ramen and didn't have any room for their epic appetizers, which I'm pretty sure next time I'll tackle because I love their famous Shrimp Balls!  I'm glad to see that Jinya is still a great late night ramen spot that's not too far away from the Strip.  It's still my favorite Ramen spot in Vegas and everything on the menu that I've had has been amazing so far!",

The tonkotsu has a subtle, creamy texture, which goes well with the veggies and noodles. And their noodles have a good bite to them while being able to pick up the flavors of the broth.   I recommend this place to all visitors (and locals) who are looking for a good ramen place in Vegas!",

My friend introduced me to this place a few weeks ago and I loved it ! I had their tonkatsu white ramen and it was bomb. The broth , egg , mushrooms , chashu (pork belly) , and everything was all really really good. I've been to Monta , Ramen Sora , and Fukumimi and I feel JINYA is the best out of all of them. Much better flavor and selections. My tonkatsu white bowl included an egg unlike at Fukumimi where they only give you half an egg & at Monta it's not even included , you have to pay extra for one. I ordered their spicy chicken ramen to-go for my dad and he's not a ramen person either (he doesn't even Japanese food) but he loved it too. So that says a lot about the food.  I really enjoyed the vibes here - dimly lit ambiance and good , loud music. Service was spot on. Everything here was all just very good. You will never want to cook a packet of instant noodles ever again LOL. I will definitely be coming back , although I only crave ramen like twice or three times a year.",

The thick ramen in this matched perfectly well with the soup garlicy tonkotsu and overall was super super flavorful. I couldn't believe how amazing the flavor was in the broth. Mine also came with a full soft boiled egg that was cooked to perfection. Runny, thick yoke and soy sauce flavored outside. The chasu was also bomb!!!! So flavorful and tender.  Karaage: Huge pieces. We got 5 pieces and expected them to be such tiny pieces, but noooo. These were huge, about the size of a golfball or bigger. The flavor of it was ok. Not enough marinade to make it so flavorful, but it was good because hey, it's fried food.  Takoyaki: loved loved loved this appetizer. Comes with 6 balls and each made excellent. I can't really describe the flavor of it, but it definitely tasted authentic like I've eaten in Japan. Maybe it shined with the octopus flavor that is usually lacking in other places' takoyaki. Not sure. But presentation was great, didn't want to eat it cuz it was so pretty.  As for the scenery, it has a dark Japanese bar feel. They played modern top 40/EDM music, which didn't really fit the setting, but it was enjoyable. There isn't a ton of seating, and I would not recommend a huge party. This is probably why it took forever to get seated.  Conclusion: super delicious, yummy, will definitely want to come back for sure!",

[Environment] The location and inside looked really nice. Love the decor, paintings and the Japanese feel. You can see the chefs in the kitchen cooking away the delicious ramen. I loved seeing the natural ramen noodles being cooked with an exact timer for pure perfection.   [Service] The Service wasn't too bad, they were a little slow and quiet...a little too quiet for my taste but wasn't sure if it was because we were sitting at the bar side. Could have been a little more attentive though.   [Food] The food was great. I really enjoyed my bowl of ramen (Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen). The spice was there and I could feel the kick! The flavor was really flashing and the ramen noodles itself tasted fresh and cooked perfectly. I also enjoyed the sides that were offered! Lots to choose from, I'd recommend the seasoned egg, bok Choy, Nori, and fried onions!  Overall great place...the only reason it didn't get a higher star from me was because we ordered hot sake and we found a small bug in them...TWICE! The first batch and the second after we had it returned. Not sure how clean the sake area is but I would definitely suggest they inspect that. I wouldn't want any other people to experience that and ruin their appetite.  [ Taste it, Love it, Yelp it! ]",

I already know that the prices are too high and the wait is always a bit long, but I was ok with that when I returned.  This time around I tried the black tonkatsu and spicy chicken ramen.  First off, they are already $11 and don't include many common ingredients like bamboo shoots or egg.  Then they add in weird ramen ingredients like spinach that you can't replace without being charged an extra $1-2.  But past that, the broth was bland and not even remotely spicy even though I asked for extra hot.  Then I was charged an extra $0.50 for making it \"hot\" on top of that.  Chciken chasu was also very undercooked and tasted like a chicken breast - something that does not go well with ramen.  I will not be returning and would recommend at least 5 other ramen shops in town.",

    "text": "Wow. Just... wow. 8:15pm on a Tuesday night and I show up by myself to probably one of the best meals I've had since I can remember. I sat at the bar and got so much personal attention from the staff. My waiter was SUPER attentive, the hostess checked up on me as well, and even the chef made sure everything was OK. It made for such a pleasant experience... and I haven't even gotten to the food yet (it was A++). My waiter went over the menu with me but because of the pictures on yelp and what I had gotten at other places, and because I wasn't feeling 100% (getting over a cold), I knew about 99% of what I wanted, just had to find it on the menu. I ordered the salmon tacos, pork bun, pork gyoza, tonkatsu black ramen, and a hot green tea. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed one bit. The salmon tacos had a nice refreshing taste to them and the taco itself was the perfect shell. Tons of salmon meat as well as some nice surprises such as tomatoes and onions. The pork bun was tender, flavorful, and delicious. The pork gyoza were ever so crispy and yet delicately soft at the same time. They were flavorful and did not come with sauce (they didn't need it). The gyoza did stick a little together but came apart nicely with minimal effort. Lastly, my ramen was mildly spicy and a nice temperature. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the flavor was phenomenal. My pork pieces were surprisingly cold but my waiter checked in on me instantly after a couple bites and not two minutes later I had two fresh, hot pieces I could replace my current ones with. Boy, did that make a HUGE difference. The pork was even a bit crispy toward the end for a bit of texture (but not overly so) and still juicy. My only regret is not having finished all my food and not being able to take it with me since I was staying at a hotel without a fridge/ microwave (although it was only a 10 minute drive to the restaurant, a plus). Everything came out so quickly that I was done in probably 30 min, which was great because I had had a long day. I will abso-freakin-lutely be back and maybe next time I'll up the spice a bit :)",

I started off with the tempura Brussel sprouts and the fried chicken thighs. Both were really good, although the chicken was my favorite.  I then have the wanton chicken ramen bowl. Don't let the bowl deceive you because a nice serving size comes with the order. It was really nice to have a selection of broths to choose from: chicken broth, vegetarian broth, or pork broth.  And, of all of the different noodle places that I have ever been to, this was the very 1st place that I had ever seen, where as long as you hold on to your remaining broth, you can order a second round of noodles for less than $2!  And, the list of additives that you can add to your order are plentiful. Everything from corn to butter, mushrooms, egg, cheese, tomato, at cetera etc etc.....  I will definitely be back to this place!",

The restaurant itself is super ambient, dimly lit, and plays upbeat music so it has a really cool, contemporary vibe. I love that it's open pretty late, too. The service is always fantastic. Just make sure that when you come in, if there's a wait (there usually is, in the evenings at least) you not only sign in, but somehow let the host/hostess know you've added your name to the list or you could risk being overlooked. That happened a couple times before to me, unfortunately. I still give it 5 stars because I've been going here since it opened and it's always yummy.",

    "text": "The broth wasn't the creamy, milky consistency of tonkotsu that I'm used to. I also agree with another review that stated that the servers make you feel like you're bothering them. Our server had no personality as he never once smiled and seemed annoyed when I asked a question about the broth. The hostess, on the other hand, was very nice and friendly. I will say that the place is cute and trendy and that the pork bun was one of the best I've ever had, but overall this place isn't an option when it comes to ramen for me.",

It was simple 2 ramen bowls. He dropped our water and then left to place our order. After about 10 mins he came back and stated that our order will take 15 more mins to be made.   So we understood and sat patiently waiting for our food. The time was around 8pm. 15 mins went past and no food. So I still waited. At around 8:30pm I had to get the servers attention. As he never came back to apologize nor say that it will take a little longer. I caught his attention and told him about our wait. He apologized and came back saying it is coming in another 10 mins.   we finally got out food at 8:45pm. Not a big fan of complaining but it was such a bad service on the servers end that ruined the whole night. The food was great as expected. We were given a bowl of edamame for the inconvenience. But I didn't want edamame, I just wanted what I ordered and good service.   Hope they fix the issue and have better communication with their guests.   2 star for bad service.",

I've been coming here since they've opened, and unfortunately over the past year the staff has become increasingly rude! Each time I call for a pick up order I'm hung up on at least twice before being able to actually place an order. Whenever I've arrived the hostess never acknowledges me or anyone else for that matter. Tonight when I picked up an order my husband placed, it was by far the most unpleasant experience yet. Safe to say this establishment will never get my hard earned money again!",

Wait time at 2 am for a table is roughly 10-15 minutes on the weekend.  I had the chefs special which was chicken based and spicy.  Mushrooms and seasoned egg and fresh garlic as additions.  Overall it was great. Food came out timely and server was very helpful and polite. We went back again on your trip and the experience was just as pleasant.  Ps. If you aren't into creamy based soups don't choose mild for anything. As the consistency changes based on the spice level.",

Comparing the two I liked the thick and my husband preferred the thin noodles.   The staff was great. Our waitress spent time going over the menu with us. Not needed but definitely appreciated.

Usually drunchies are the worst so it was a bad start.   2.) the main reason why I gave this place two stars was because they messed up my order. I ordered for non-spicy Tonkotsu and she gave me a spicy bowl.. Like I said, I spicy isn't in my palette so you could only imagine eating a jalapeno when you're drunk.   I didn't bother to complain, I still paid & just left unhappy. Wish I better had a better experience, but it happens. :/",

Same server got our drinks started and offered to explain how their menu worked. Great job at up selling appetizers and specialty drinks. We ended up ordering 2 Chicken Won Ton Noodles, Pork Gyoza (6 pot stickers), one of their Watermelon Delight Summer Drinks, and an order of their Chocolate Mochi Ice Cream and Green Tea. Food came out VERY quick despite the restaurant getting busier by the second. I can see why this place is such a hotspot, BEST NOODLES I'VE HAD IN A WHILE!!! Pot sticker appetizers were crunchy and flavorful, noodles had a great amount of wontons, veggies, and noodles. Hot sauce at the table added just the right amount of kick. Watermelon drink was very refreshing, perfect to cool off from the hot food and weather. Mochi Ice Cream topped everything off as a delicious desert. CAN NOT believe I have never heard of this place. Will definitely return, recommending this place to everyone ! Only downfall is the restaurant needs to be a LOT bigger for how popular it is!",

Upon arrival, we were seated immediately and I took notice of the lay out of the restaurant and it was very feng shui.  It flowed nicely and was decorated nicely.  Very clean, very modern with a traditional feel with the wooden tables.  It was dimly lit and there was some low music playing.  Seems like a great hang out spot for 20-somethings or even a place to take a date and have a great intimate conversation with.  As for the food, my aunt was a gracious host since we were coming from out of town and I was happy to order and test out plenty of the menu.  I ordered the vegan ramen, edamame, and mochi ice cream.  As for the rest of my group, they ordered the ramen with the different types of meat in it and also the shrimp ball appetizers.   Everyone was blown away with the presentation as well as the taste.  Apparently the ramen sauce was also spectacular although I didn't try it as I felt my bowl was perfect the way it was.  The service was also fantastic with our waitress Kate.  She was very knowledgable, friendly, and attentive to all our needs.  It didn't hurt that she was also easy on the eyes as agreed upon by my group.  In any case, the pricing was extremely fair and reasonable and made it great value for our money.    I highly recommend coming to check this place out!",

The staff is really nice, we didn't wait at all to be seated or our order to be taken. My husband had the Spicy Chicken Ramen and said it was delicious, portion size was good and it was served pretty quickly, unfortunately that's where the problems began.  I'm a vegan, and they have a vegan option which was super exciting for me since vegan ramen is hard to come by. My excitement ended when I was informed that it wasn't available, I asked when it would be and they have no idea. So why even have it on the menu?!? They do have a vegetarian option, but my fellow vegans know there's a difference between vegetarian and vegan. I ended up getting a simple order of a vegetable roll and steamed rice. My food arrived 15 minutes AFTER my husband got his ramen. Everyone knows there's nothing more awkward than eating while the other person just watches.They were nice enough to let me know my food was on its way but by then I was already pretty annoyed. My food was just ok.  I'm gonna give this place another chance and hopefully it'll be a lot better.",

It was the fourth ( and the last time that I'm ever coming here) that left me completely disappointed and dissatisfied with the overall food and service. My boyfriend, his friend, and I were sat down at a table where AC was put on blast. I understand it's summer and it's super hot out but I was freezing! Second, the food had absolutely no flavor. I ordered what I usually do (the vegan ramen) and it was completely bland. Third, we had to wait almost 30 min for the waiter to get our cards and check in order for us to be able to pay for our food. The waiter was inattentive for the most part and was kind of rude. As someone who has worked for customer service for a few years now, I usually try to be completely understanding but this was by far one of the worst experiences I've had. I honestly don't understand the hype about this place. I'm guessing it's because they're the only ramen place opened past midnight. Don't bother to waste your time and money here. Monta ramen is so much better; their ramen has so much flavor, service is quick, and attentive.",

The pork wasn't as flavorful and good. The gyoza was very well done, very juicy but were very vegetable heavy which is good /for me/ but some may prefer theirs more on the pork side. The sprouts tempura was good but maybe a little undercooked. The Crispy chicken was good but nothing about it really stood out for me  All in all I wouldn't say it's /the/ best but it's /one of the/ best places for Ramen in town. it's also bigger than some of the really tiny places so hopefully the wait won't get bad.  I will frequent this place",

The restaurant was busy and we had to wait about 20 minutes which was fine. Our waitress was very sweet and I liked the menu however the food was not impressive. Parts of my food were very cold and other parts were warm. For example, the seasoned egg in my ramen soup was cold on the inside. How does that happen? My family didn't really care for the ramen because the broth was very, very thick and too rich for their taste. I thought it was okay but I do agree that it was very thick. So if you like thick ramen broth this may be a place for you! However I don't think there is an excuse for ramen broth being luke warm and for the eggs and noodles being cold.",

    "text": "After seeing and eating a couple days of fancy casino food, we were craving some comfort food.  Ramen fit the occasion perfectly.  We accidentally stumbled upon this place, in fact almost drove by because it was dark and looked closed.  It was 1:30am so we didn't really think the place was actually open.   But then again this was Las Vegas, why wouldn't it be?  First impression, dark like a bar, in fact if I didn't see the ramen on the other tables, I would have easily thought this place was a bar.  The music was similar to what you'd find in a bar scene.  Loud,  Really loud and annoying.  One of the owners just happen to be there, young guy, who just happened to originally be from Hawaii.  I thought I'd compliment him on the ramen flavor and at the same time ask him to turn down the music so we could hear each talk and have a conversation.  It was also really cold in the restaurant, perhaps time of the morning and lack of bodies in the place had something to do with that.  After our eyes got adjusted to the dark atmosphere and loud music, we focused in on the ramen.  Thin noodles, rich tonkatsu broth (that you know took days pto produce), the wonderful garlic flavors and the perfectly cooked egg.  The atmosphere, not too desirable, but the food was so amazingly delicious! It was as good, if not better than, authentic ramen from Japan.  The menu is perfect for picky eaters, who can order their noodles thick or thin, and customize their dish with a number of add-ons.   The most incredible thing was the spicy sauce, photo enclosed of the chefs creation.  Stopped in the restroom prior to leaving, very clean, toilets were the fancy Japanese high end ones that you find in 5 star, Tokyo hotels.  To me, restrooms are a good measure on how to gauge how much a restaurant cares.    If your ever in Las Vegas and are looking for a very good bowl of ramen, visit and try it, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",

However tonight my entire perception of what I thought was a great establishment has been shot due to an incredibly lame and pathetic excuse. My party and I waited only 15 mins to be sat which is fine we've waited longer. The complaint is after our order was placed approx 5 parties were seated, fed, and out of the restaurant before even one of the 3 bowls of ramen we ordered were ready. The waitress was loud and kept saying our food was coming. But that wasn't True. The second excuse (being the lame and pathetic one) was that their ticket printer broke down during our visit. Well if that was the case how did the parties mentioned earlier eat and pay for their meals? The reason our order wasnt placed is beyond me and although I may never known the truth as to why we didnt get it, I do know that JINYA Ramen Bar will no longer be receiving our business. A place that is now stained with a disgraceful lack of customer service.",

I've lived in Japan and eaten enough ramen there (and in the US) to experience what good ramen is.  Maybe it's just this location b/c I've been to Robata Jinya in LA for Ramen and it was good.  What this Jinya does have going for it is menu variety but it's a double edged sword as execution can be inconsistent when you try to do too many things at once. On that note, execution was lacking in both front of house with seating and service and back of house with food quality.  Seems that the restaurant is run by young kids just winging it as a first job or part time job. Service and attention to detail is lacking. Dirty tables were bussed in \"batches\" rather than individually and thus people were waiting looking at each other with confused looks. Nobody asked or checked up on us. Restaurants thrive on turnover but is obviously not a metric that these employees are aware of.  Ordered the Sprouting Up Ramen and the Cha Cha Cha (both which are \"Jinya Recommended\" items).  I know Jinya serves fusion ramen but there shouldn't be fat chunks floating in your ramen... The only fusion with fat chunks is how it fuses to my belly, which can't be good.  Extra noodles which were ordered never came and had to ask 2 times for them. Finally arrived and fortunately portions were large but my soup was already cold...  Jinya should have their employees visit Japan to understand what attention to detail, pride and service. Or better yet, just visit Monta Ramen.",

No problem! This place takes order until 2:45AM!   Appetizers: Jinya Bun, Gyoza, Takoyaki, and Crispy Shrimp Ball Ramen: Jinya Tonkotsu Black; Cha Cha Cha; and Tonkotsu Assari  Loved the Tonkotsu Black ramen! Order this if you're a fan of thin noodles! Broth is soooo good!   Jinya Bun - so flavorful! get it!  I highly recommend this place for ramen lovers!",

    "text": "Absolutely loved my first experience at Jinya Ramen Bar!  My mom and I came for a somewhat early dinner and waited for about 20 minutes or so, not too bad for a Sunday evening! I put my name down on the waiting list and peaked inside the restaurant. I was surprised at the size of the place. It was actually smaller than what I expected it to be, but bigger than Monta's interior. The dining table in the middle of the restaurant reminds me of medieval times, really cool.  We were seated and greeted by our waiter. He was so friendly and since it was our first time, he explained the menu to us and even recommended a few of his favorites! He suggested the JINYA Tonkotsu Black and also said that it was one of the best sellers. Now I know why! I was already thinking about ordering the Tonkotsu Black, but his suggestion just confirmed that it's what I would be ordering. The broth was creamy, hot, rich, and full of flavor. Anyone who loves ramen knows that the broth is the most important part of the dish and Jinya definitely nailed it. The broth was also really garlicky, which I loved! It was served with the right amount of thin noodles and the toppings gave the dish the perfect texture. The kikurage is my fav!  I also ordered the Tokyo Curry Rice and house salad to pair with my bowl of ramen. After the Tokyo Curry Rice arrived to our table, I won't lie, I was a little skeptical at first. To be quite honest, it didn't look appetizing at all, but oh my god, was I wrong! Why did I not know that this stuff exists? It was packed with flavor and extremely filling on its own. I would definitely recommend this dish! The house salad was okay. It was made with arugula, which I'm not too big a fan of, but the dressing was interesting and tasted good!  As far as appetizers go, my mom ordered the gyoza and the JINYA Bun. She enjoyed both, especially the Bun. We'll have to come back and try the Crispy Shrimp Balls because that's what everyone around us seemed to be ordering!  Overall, a great bar to get your ramen fix! The service was great, our food was even better, prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere was hip! Can't wait to bring the rest of my family to Jinya and show them what it's all about!",

But I literally find myself wanting Jinya like crazy!! I've gone 2 times in the last week! First off I love the atmosphere it's very warm with the dark woods and they play awesome music that's not on everyday radio.   We started out with iced green tea which was super refreshing and had free refills. Next up the Jinya buns. DO NOT SKIP THE BUNS!! The pork is sooo tender and the sauce is yummy. We tried the premium white tonkotsu and it didn't disappoint. The broth has more flavor then I ever expected. It was lighter in texture even though it appeared very creamy. The noodles were PERFECT in texture. I didn't use any condiments but they do have chili sauce and ramen seasoning on the table.   One thing that I think is SUPER cool is they have a kids meal. This thing contains so much food I was in disbelief. When I saw the menu I had to ask 8 we choose and item, but mope! You get everything listed/pictured! Chicken ramen with corn and spinach, chashu rice bowl with spinach, chicken karrage, fries, orange slice, a lollipop, and their tofu dessert!! All for $7!!  Since my 5 year old can't eat all that we got to try a bunch of stuff. Their karrage was amazing, it is kind of heavy on salt so if you're sensitive pass it up.   Our service was eh, at best. But the food and decent price point out shown the service. I can't wait to go eat Jinya now that I've been thinking about it since I started this review.",

Aside from the darkness, the restaurant is pretty cute considering it use to be a Taco Bell. Too bad they didn't keep the drive thru, that would've been awesome.   So far, I've had the spicy chicken, tonkatsu black, cha cha cha, and miso ramen. They were all ok. The broth is just too rich and fatty tasting for my personal preference. I actually prefer the tapas over the ramen. The Jinya bun is pretty tasty and I love the crispy shrimp balls. Service has always been prompt and polite.",

But I saw that Jinya just opened and it offered a happy hour?! I just had to check it out.  Jinya opens up at 3pm, which is also when their HH starts (3- 5pm) which is great if you want to enjoy some ramen and different appetizers/beer.  They even offer bottomless mimosas for $10!  I love how extensive their menu is!  There are about 10 different ramen to choose from, you can also turn it into a combo which includes a salad + your choice (either gyoza, chasu bowl, curry rice, california roll, crispy chicken.) And if you're not feeling like ramen, you can order off their tapas menu which includes salads, curry and rice bowls, desserts, and more.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Black Ramen and Jinya Bun.  The Jinya bun was a great start to the meal!  The Chasu Pork had the melt in yo mouth consistency and the gooeyness from the barbecue sauce went perfectly together.   The ramen was just as described and looked exactly like the picture!  What sets Jinya apart from the others is the flavor of their broth. My tastebuds are usually hit by overload of salt and it just ruins the experience for me.  However, with Jinya's broth, the garlic oil, garlic chips, fried onion, and chili paste added depth to the broth and changed my perspective on going out for ramen.  I'm actually really excited to come back for more!",

They didn't even know they had the same shift and were discussing it for good ten minutes and take another 10 to delegate duties while there were bunch of empty tables ready. One of the hostess just stood around looking lost. Once seated, the party after us somehow got their food before us. I also noticed that there were a lot of tables empty that were not cleaned when they could have cleaned and seated all the angry customers waiting. I got the sprouted ramen which was alright, there were shit ton of sprouts. The broth was alright in the salty thick side. Not the best ramen I have had and not the worst. I don't think I would come back here, I will spend that hr wait time at Monta ramen instead.  Overall Taste 3/5 Service 1/5 Price 3/5 not that worth for me Parking 3/5 plenty in the lot",

We had the Gyoza appetizer and it tasted amazing! Just like my mom makes at home from scratch. My boyfriend had the pork ramen soup which I loved, (of course I had to take a bite). It was more of a classic broth with thicker noodles, a little salty but probably just from the pork. Good thing I like salt! I had the spicy chicken soup. Really good, I added cilantro for some fun on the side and it was good together. The soup wasn't that spicy so if anything I'd ask to make it a bit more spicy next time.   The servers, host, and cooks were amazing! The whole staff welcomes you in and works as a team to give you great service. And when you leave the whole staff then says thank you as you walk out the door. Super friendly people. I will definitely return!",

Friends from LA had been telling us about Robata Jinya opening its sister restaurant here in Vegas...and thanks to foodie friend on IG, we saw that it finally opened.  The roomie immediately \"dragged\" me here specifically for their shrimp toast as Robata's shrimp toast is his ultimate fave food. I, on the otherhand, was looking forward to trying their ramen (it is a ramen bar, afterall).  Got here around 10pm, and it was fairly slow with half the place filled. Nice decor with a large table in the middle; perfect for larger parties. You could tell that it just opened as there was still decorators tape on the mirrors and walls.  Sat down and was gladly seated by the waitress and she was very informative on the menu and what they're known for. Roomie immediately ordered the shrimp toast but, it was sadly sold out --- lemme tell you that the roomie was like, \"ohkaaay, lets leave!\" lol  We settled on fried chicken, shrimp balls, truffle fries, veggie ramen, and two combo orders of the #1 tonkatsu black ramen with charshu and Tokyo curry bowls.  Fried chicken - Nice batter on the chicken, juicy, and VERY good with or without it's ponzu dipping sauce.  Shrimp balls - First thought when biting into this deliciously crunchy cream cheese filled morsel: it tastes like shrimp chips!!!!! All you/us Asians know about shrimp chips! YUM =)  Truffle fries - Can never go wrong with anything truffle but, I just couldn't get enough of the truffle ketchup =)))))))  Tonkatsu black ramen - My new favorite as the \"thin\" noodles were al dente and just to my liking. Broth wasn't salty at all which is extra to my liking cuz I'm not into salty/miso flavors. Broth was, also, light and not too heavy which made it easier to finish the whole bowl. The mushrooms and garlic chips added the extra crunch which is always delicious. Sadly, they were out of egg so didn't add egg to these ramens; but, added extra charshu instead -- I ain't mad at that. I really liked the charshu in the ramen yet, the charchu bowl was very whatever. Their Tokyo curry rice was sweet and I don't like sweet curry. I was hoping for a more spicier version. (((((so, on that aspect - no one is touching Ramen Sora's curry and charshu bowls!)))))  Veggie ramen - Roomie found it but, thought there was tooo much veggies in there and the broth was rather bland.   Overall, a new favorite and I'd gladly come here again and, hopefully, soon! Especially since I still have yet to try their shrimp toast!  *****side note: they have the best women's bathroom....it's a BIDET with SEAT WARMERS! lol*****",

    "text": "Stopped by last week to meet up with my homie Michael K for happy hour but wasn't too impressed. Although the HH prices are fairly cheap, like $2-3 for everything, it's not much of a discount off the original price so it's not really worth going out of your way to make it on time. For example the Jinya bun is $3.80 but during HH it's 3 bucks. Crispy chicken is usually $5 but during HH it's 3 bucks as well. Anyways, HH is daily from 3 to 5 PM.  Didn't get ramen on this visit because it was still early for dinner and we wanted to take full advantage of the happy hour specials. Plus, I was a little turned off by their ramen pricing which seemed a little steep for what seems like a standard sized bowl. I ordered a Jinya bun and crispy chicken which is basically karage. The Jinya bun was surprisingly delicious and I loved how tender and flavorful the meat is. The crispy chicken is a 5 piece order which makes it a killer deal for 3 bucks during HH; tastes similar to karage I've had at any other ramen joint. I tried some of Michael's tempura fried brussel sprouts but they aren't for me, probably because I'm not a big brussel sprouts eater...I'm sure it's a taste that I just haven't acquired.  The service was pretty decent although I felt like they came by our table way too often to try to pick up empty plates practically as soon as we were done with the item and to ask if we needed water refills. Seriously, no one drinks water that fast so chill!",

I Am a vegan , came here for the vegan ramen , the host , server , and I had a convo about the broth options and warned me about one containing fish , so I made it my biz to make sure she knew I wanted the VEGAN broth , &  no animal products in my ramen bowl what so ever  , I most certainly consumed something that was cross contaminated with meat or fish.  the kitchen was pretty busy, not sure if they have a separate section , or separate cool in kitchen dedicated to making vegan options. this is a lesson , do not eat at places that are not FULLY vegan , they don't have the correct vegan ethics to sell vegan options . Vegans are highly concerned about cross contamination and animal fluids getting in their food. I never vomited in my life , since being a baby , I'm extremely healthy, tonight I was poisoned. thank you JINYA , lesson learned ||| UPDATE ! I was contacted by shift manager of Jinya after I wrote this review and she confirmed that They are making the vegan soup in the same area they cook the dead animals. this item should be removed from the menu , it's not vegan if dead animal energy is KNOWINGLY being cross contaminated into the vegan food.   If you are a vegan DONT EAT HERE !!!! You will get very sick, they are very busy and will not take the  time to make sure your food is not contaminated.  you will get sick  !",

    "text": "For a former fast-food restaurant, this place has completely transformed to be a new player in the Vegas ramen wars. Exterior is all black, interior is swanky and looks like a lounge. Very welcoming, very clean. Menu is fairly extensive with a few different types of ramens, a handful of sides, add-ons, tapas options, and a few desserts.  JINYA BUN is $3 (~$4 regular) on HH menu- chashu on a bao, simple, classic, flavorful, and delicious. The tempura BRUSSELS SPROUTS were crispy and fresh with a touch of truffle oil that didn't overwhelm but added an extra savory note. CRISPY RICE WITH SPICY TUNA is a favorite dish of mine: I'm not a jalapeno fan but the thin slices are the perfect complement to the tuna and rice, which is perfectly crisp and never burned. CRISPY CHICKEN is super-moist and flavorful, plated with a small salad with their fabulous dressing and a delightful dipping sauce.  RAMENS: TONKOTSU ASSARI- pork broth, chashu, karagge, green onion, seasoned egg, spicy bean sprouts, and thick noodles: delish! Broth had good depth of flavor without feeling too fatty (server described it as one of their lighter options), noodles were chewy and the egg was just slightly overcooked. [2nd visit] TOKOTSU BLACK- pork broth, pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, nori, egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, and THIN noodles: full bodied broth, but highly preferred the thicker noodles, the thin ones are too similar to spaghetti IMO. [Millionth Visit] SPICY CHICKEN TONKOTSU: amazing noodles with a spicy broth and ground chicken. No egg. Reminiscent of a lighter version of Sora's spicy ramen bowl but without the heavy grease of Fukumimu's tan tan men.  Very pleased with food and service- so much so that I went two days in  row.  Affordable pricing (see receipts in pics). Management visible throughout my visits, interacting with visitors. If this is any indication of an average visit here, they'll have a huge following with a waitlist very soon.",

This place may have changed the way I see ramen.   I came here right when they opened. I noticed it started to fill up about the time we left, 4.   I decided on the black ramen combo, which came with a salad and another side. I chose Chashu pork. The ramen broth was nice and light. I really enjoyed the thin noodles. This bowl was huge too. As I was eating, I felt like it kept refilling itself like in Harry potter. There was a good amount of meat, but not too much. The Chashu pork was also delicious! I absolutely loved the egg that came with it. The combo is definitely a bang for your buck kind of deal  3-5 is when they have happy hour. I didn't actually get anything off the happy hour menu, but I'd be down to come back and try it sometime.  The service was pretty attentive. They made sure we were enjoying our food. When we were trying to decide what to get, the waiter brought over the sign for the new ramen they had, just so we could have an easier time deciding.",

    "text": "I love ramen and I've tried most ramen places in town. First time I've heard about Jinya was in the Ramen Festival last year in Rio. The rumor was they were coming to Vegas to open. They were not my favorite in the ramen festival but it was better than the most as well. That's why I had to check it out.  Food  1.Homemade tofu- the concept is interesting. They poured the hot soy milk in front of you and after five minutes the tofu started to get firm. It comes with seasoning you can add to your tofu. I personally think it's fun to order and it doesn't taste too bad. However, homemade tofu in Raku is still my favorite.  2. Crispy chicken- it comes with 5/10/15 pieces. They are not the usual karage where the chicken nugget is bite size. I would say they are twice as big as normal karage. However, that was my favorite dish of the night. Chicken was marinated perfect, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.   3. Tonkatsu black- I was impressed that they give your a whole egg instead of half. The pork was tender and noodle was nice and chewy. The broth is not salty which is a plus for me. Tonkastu in Monta is too salty for my palate. However, I think the broth can be more flavorful. This is why I'm giving four stars.   Service was attentive and decent. Decor was hip and spacious. I would definitely return and try other items on the menu.",

There is a small ramen bar in front of the kitchen and a small Japanese themed dining area. The staff were all very friendly and the restaurant appeared to be very clean.  The food and the service was better than average. I would definitely recommend giving this place a go.  Takoyaki - this was excellent. If you like the Japanese dish Okino Miyaki then you will like this dish. It is basically the same ingredients and then it is shaped in to bite size portions.  Crispy Rice with spicy tuna - this is just what it says it is. It was good.  Crispy Chicken with ponzu sauce - This would have been a good choice if the chicken would not have been so greasy. I think the oil in the fryer needed to be changed or they dropped the chicken back in the fryer after it was cooked.  Spicy chicken ramen noodle - the ramen was excellent. I ordered it \"Hot\". It had a lot of heat to it, but not so much heat that you could not enjoy it. I may just go with \"Spicy\" next time though.",

They weren't kidding when they said \"veggies\", the bowl was overflowing with greens and vegetables. Awesome amount of food for the price you pay. The have various other bowls with chicken and pork as well, and you can get it spicy or not.  They also have the option of adding extras to your order. Extra noodles, meat, egg, etc. Really great idea, since I think we can all agree we need a little more noodle in our lives.  They have a surprising selection of beer here. While it's no where near a 'craft beer bar', they do have a couple craft beers that pair great with your bowl of noodles.  The only downside to this place is it is small, so chances are if you go during normal dining hours, it's going to be packed and a bit of a wait. However the Ramen Bar is open late, so if you need a late night meal it's perfect.",

Pros: Great atmosphere that has both a modern, and authentic feel to it.            Excellent, quick, and friendly service.           Great variety in their Ramen menu.(For Ramen)           Open til 3am, I mean really? 3am Definitely helps when you are craving it.  Cons: Really there's only one. And it would be consistency, most of the time the food is perfect. However a couple of times I've noticed the base to either be completely over-powering, or slightly underwhelming and that's only happened maybe twice.   All in all, definitely a must go to when you're in the mood for some absolutely delicious ramen.",

    "text": "Waiting time was quiet long.. Atmosphere was nice and service was good. A little bit noisy, music was quiet loud, but okay. They do veggie broth which I was looking for. As a starter I had some cold tofu with seaweed on top, don't remember the name. But it was really good. The dressing is a little sour, add some gyoza (I guess it was soy sauce) and you're good to go! I did the veggie ramen soup with dried seaweed topping. Was yummy, especially the mushrooms and asparagus! I don't like when you put broccoli in an Asian soup (like pho/ ramen soups) because it ruins the taste of it. Will tell them to leave them out next time. And I want to try corn topping too. All in all I'm happy with my dinner.",

    "text": "One of my favorite Ramen bars in Vegas.  Good options of Ramen. Worth the wait each time.   One thing though- I always get the Cha Cha Cha for garlic lovers. The server today wouldn't sub my thick noodles with thin. All the other times (and I've been here a total of around ten) I was able to. The other servers were awesome at catering to my request, despite what the menu stated. This particular server was so quick to say no to the request, it ruined my experience today.   I didn't catch her name- she was a short thin Asian female with short hair. The description doesn't really help. Avoid this server at all costs. Very rude and not welcoming. All the other servers and hosts are phenomenal, esp. the males. I'm sad I didn't get this server's name.   Despite the experience, I consumed the meal halfway although it wasn't the same and took the rest to-go. I will definitely be back.... but will refuse this server! She's probably new since it's my first time seeing her.",

We waited a bit longer then should have for our food because the kitchen messed up on our order, which is totally okay because people make mistakes and I appreciated that Yoshi was very apologetic and gave us some appetizers on the house. He had a great attitude and kept a smile on his face the entire time. Thanks Yoshi! It's hard to find great customer like yours :)",

The spicy ramen is not spicy and the broth was not hot. The service was substandard. The beef was cold and the inside of the egg was also cold. We eat ramen pretty regularly but have to say we will never go back here.",

The staff was friendly and attentive and very helpful with any questions that we had about their menu. It is a place I will return to.",

    "text": "Each business has its pros and cons. For this place the pros fortunately outweigh the cons.  Pros: the pig ear chicharon, the crispy rice with spicy tuna, and the tonkotsu black ramen with extra pork. All absolutely delicious! I've been here multiple times and I've tried many things on the menu but I narrowed it down to 3 favorites to avoid this review being too long. The pig ear chicharon was fried absolutely perfectly and the poached egg gave it a little something extra but didn't overpower the dish. The crispy rice was perfectly crispy and we got a second order since it was happy hour.  If you're solo dining and sitting at the counter you're right by the kitchen and you can talk to the chefs. They're super friendly and knowledgeable about the food they're putting out   Con: I understand that sometimes they get busy, which is good otherwise they wouldn't be open. But your hostess shouldn't be bussing tables. I've been in here on a couple occasions and at times I've had to wait over 10 minutes to even get greeted because she's clearing tables. The hostess should be doing standard side work such as cleaning menus and rolling silverware, so that if customers come in she can greet them right away. If I didn't like the food so much I would have walked out. Also, more than 1 POS system might be good for efficiency  P.S: check out the toilet in the ladies room!",

Otherwise, the food is great and the atmosphere is cool. My girlfriend and I got some chicken wings and gyoza . She got  the spicy chicken ramen and loved it and I ate the Cha Cha Cha ramen. The broth is amazing, the noodles were great and everything else was delicious as well. Only critique I would say is that it had a bit too many bean sprouts,but that is just my opinion. I feel a lot of asian restaurants use them as fillers and if you use too many they just rob the rich flavor of the food. Anyway, if you aren't in a rush check it out, but if you are short on time I would go elsewhere.  Oh,The seats for the booths are massive so if you are ridiculously fat then don't worry. You will slide that fat ass right in there and feel right at home.",

The food was great as always, but this was the first time I've received bad service. The server got the orders right; however, she was very inattentive and very blunt when talking to the table. My friend and I finished our drinks halfway through our meal, but our server never came around to ask if we wanted refills (and we did). We asked for utensils as well, and didn't receive them for about ten minutes afterwards. We also waited about a half hour after we were done with our meal to get her attention for our check, and in that time she talked to every table around us without noticing  us. We had tried to get her attention several times and also made eye contact with her, but nothing. I've never had a bad experience here, and I love jinya...I still love the food but the service was very upsetting.",
