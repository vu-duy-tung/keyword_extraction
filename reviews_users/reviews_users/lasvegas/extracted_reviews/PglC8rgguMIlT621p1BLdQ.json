    "text": "I dinned at  this restaurant after looking it up on Google of one of the better dim sum eats in Las Vegas. About a 10 minute Lyft ride from the strip,  The place was nice and clean with an open area for the carts to be pushed around.  There were three people pushing carts around with variety of small plates steamed only however. With the exception of one person pushing a cart with an attitude,  the staff was friendly and accomadating. The food was good I would say a little above average versus most dim sum place. Most of the dishes tasted fresh and we even order some stuff off the menu which arrived fairly quickly. Lots of Asian patrons here that usually mean is a good place for Asian food. Price was very reasonable and I would definitely recommend this place to a friend.",

Loved the curry noodle soup as well.  The soup dumplings were not as good.  Service was attentive and friendly!",

    "text": "My family and I have pretty much ravaged Vegas for the past 10 years in search of our favorite Asian restaurants there for specific cuisines so we were super surprised to find that we hadn't been to Yum Cha for dim sum before despite its stellar reviews and ratings. We were definitely not disappointed though and even came back here twice in one trip! The food and the service are both phenomenal so if you're looking for a dim sum spot in Vegas, this is it!   Despite its popularity, there was pretty much never a wait since they have an abundance of seating and the staff are incredibly efficient throughout the entire meal. Upon walking in, it looks like a take out type of place but they actually do seat you so don't be confused~! Here, they only cart around steamed items so everything else you order from the menu (but those items come out fairly quick as well). Their most well known item is definitely the baked custard bun (even one of the ladies who help to manage said someone once ordered 100 of these to go to take back to California) -- seriously melt in your mouth heaven!! Aside from that, all of the dim sum items were yummy and didn't disappoint; you'll get exactly what you want for dim sum.   The only thing that might be a little iffy for those coming from California is the slightly higher pricing for dim sum which ranges from like ~$4-$7 per item. One of the employees said this was their most common question/complaint was the pricing, but I honestly think it's understandable considering their popularity and lack of competition compared to California. Despite the higher pricing, I definitely still think it's worth it, especially since it's hard to come by an awesome dim sum place with even more excellent and friendlier staff in Vegas if you're visiting. Will most likely be coming back here whenever we're in Vegas again!! :)",

It seems really happy and vibrant inside. It's clean as well which is great because other dim sum places I been to, it's not that clean. Their service is really friendly here. I want to try their hot pot since it advertise that they have it here but I haven't got the chance. So far I had their dim sum and regular Chinese dishes here and all been good.",

It's close to us (Spring Valley) and because it's not right on Spring Mountain it's never a long wait to be seated. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. Their shrimp dumplings, shrimp & pork shumai, and steamed bbq pork bun are our favorites. For dessert try the baked lava custard bun! So delicious. Their dim sum goes great with the hot tea they serve. They also have a lot of vegetarian and vegan options, which is rare at a lot of dim sum places! Lastly, the prices are very reasonable and you can get a lot of dim sum at an inexpensive price.",

They have the freshest, tastiest dim sums ever. Everything is made fresh to order - not like some where you know it's been sitting in those carts since lunch time began. That's another thing, they don't do push carts - you simply order. They also have been attentive and friendly - each time we go we are met by the owners(?)/managers(?). We LOVE this place so much we plan a trip just to come here. It's really the best dim sum and they serve it all day! Not like most places that end at 3pm.

Straight to the food:  -Salt and pepper shrimp was too salty. Had to scrape some off.  -pork belly: looked like a lot of pork in the picture but actually a small serving. We laughed about it. Taste was ok. I've had better fatty food. Yup, I said it.   -siomai- shrimp and pork/ mushrooms were very good. Added 1 more order, in fact. Hey, we were hungry.   -shrimp toast- Ha, good too. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Wait a minute, that's me!!   -sticky rice wrapped in leaf (you guys remember what it's called?)- good but small serving. I mean, tiny. But an order has 2 pieces. Maybe they should combine it and have 1 good sized serving. Not complaining... just a suggestion.   -egg tarts- I've had better. Wife said it wasn't fresh.  Yup, she can tell. Her taste buds don't lie. Mine do, darn it. I ate it all.   -Buchi rolls- those round things covered with sesame seeds and has red bean inside (its for those who don't know). Epic description? Thanks for going with it. I liked it.   So in a nutshell, 3.5 stars. Not 4. There's better. Might come back when they have carts going around. We ate about 5 pm. Came straight from the airport. Should have been in my intro.   Would recommend some because it's not bad at all. I might come back.",

The best part is their top notch customer service we received. Their siomai was super salty and our group of 7 people had ordered three orders before trying it. We asked the waitress if we can trade out the two we didn't touch for something else. Without hesitation they said yes and which two dishes we would like to replace them with. One of the lady's there not sure if she's the manager, was constantly apologetic about the siomai and mentioned it usually doesn't taste salty like that and it is our fault because we had a really busy weekend due to the holidays. Most of our food was cooked fresh and most on the cart tasted fresh or not old like many Dim Sum's. Hargow, pork bun, chicken feet, meat rice cake, fried rice, spinach dumpling, and pork dumpling were all good. The only thing I would say, don't order the fried pork belly (super small and is not with the price). When I'm back in Vegas I will definitely be back, the food was pretty good, but it's the customer service that puts the cherry on top for me!",

I felt out of all the other places we tried this one had one of the better selections of items.  I've had A LOT of dim sum, and was very happy with this place.  The roasted pork buns were especially yummy- always hot, soft, with some sweetness.  If you enjoy traditional dim sum this is the place to go.  It's about 2 miles off The Strip, making it super convenient to get to.  (We stayed at Luxor and it literally was a 10 minute drive.). It's definitely worth the trip.",

As a child, my Mom used to take me to Clement St. in San Francisco. this place brought that nostalgia right back to me. Highly Recommend for all your Dim Sum needs!",

The Dim Sum we picked were the steamed pork buns also the chicken buns (both soft and delicious). The veggie noodles were really tasty and quite a large portion (so we couldn't even finish it). I enjoyed the curry turnovers, but my friend thought they were to strong in the curry flavor (kind of like an Indian Samosa). Dinner time they have you order what you want, but at lunch they have carts going around to try different things (sounds fun). All in all, I definitely recommend this tasty place!",

Until the third one, and then we got the tea.  Shrimp dumpling was fine but I don't consider others up to par at all.  We ordered the baked roast park buns and the inside don't taste like roast pork.  I also went up to the buffet setting to check out the food, and none seems to be appealing.

I was greeted by the owner, and he took the time to explain to me that carts run from 10-3, but that I can also go to the food counter or order from the menu.  How outstanding that I can get my food 3 different ways (2 ways after 3PM when carts stop).  All the common dim sum goods can be gotten off carts, but those items are all also on the menu and most of the rest that my friends and I can think of is available on the menu or at the counter.    In addition to the owner, the service is attentive and friendly.  The cart runners made it to my table every few minutes and the waiter checked in regularly for drinks and other matters.  The food displayed at the counter is for show and what you ask for is made to order.    Dim Sum and tea is a staple in my circle of friends, and we have been to many establishments serving this type of cuisine in Las Vegas and other major cities.  Yum Cha is up there with any other place I've been to and will be our new cornerstone.",

    "text": "So me and my boyfriend have been craving a good dimsum restaurant. And we found this one that has 4 stars. We lived down in henderson so we drove 25 minutes to give this place a try.   So we got there, two other group were there but we all got seated right away. Then it took about 10 minutes before someone took our order. We had the feeling that they're going to take a long time. So we ordered a lot all at once. It took about 20 minutes to finally get our food. It felt longer because we're both starving.   While we're waiting for our food to come. Another couple came in. And literally they did not wait for long. And it seems like they were taking care of them more than anyone. They got their food first even though we were there 20 minutes before them. They were making sure their water get refilled while me and my boyfriend clearly have empty water glass but We have to ask to get our water refilled. They were asking if their okay or if they need anything else several times with that table while me and my boyfriend and the two other group that came in the same time we did, they didn't even ask if we need anything. We always have to call them. It's not like we're rude or we're asking for so much. We even cleaned out our own table and even gave them a good tip even though they didn't really took care of us. I'm a server so I know how it is to be a server.   But overall. The food is great. It tasted fresh. It was really good. But the service. Not so great. It's not that they were rude. It's just that they didn't take care of us but they took care of that other table well.   But I don't know if we would ever come back. I'm sorry.",

Yelping for other restaurants, we came across YumCha. Honestly, this is a really good Chinese restaurant and I enjoyed the variety of food they offered and how authentic it was. Lots of dim sum variety too.   Ps: Don't get freaked out by the the cages hanged on the ceiling. My baby cousin looked at it and thought there were birds inside.",

Walking into Yum Cha, the staff is very prompt in greeting us quickly and the restaurant is very spacious and roomy.   We came in for the dim sum on a Sunday afternoon and there was no problem with getting seated. After 2:30pm dim sum items are not pushed around on a cart, rather they are made to order. From chicken feet, to shu mai, fried shrimp rolls, we piled up a total of about 20 dishes total costing us no more than about $80 in all. The portions were just perfect to share and all the dishes came out well presented and savory.   Would definitely recommend for the awesome staff that checked in on us often and I promise you won't come for dim sum and leave hungry!",

Unfortunatley, Yum Cha is not worth the time or money on this journey.   The Dim Sum, though freshly steamed, for the most part lacks flavor and distinct spices that make for an epicurrian delight. If you have eaten Dim Sum at The Orchid Garden, Yum Cha will be a major disappointment.   Not able to find satisfaction with the Dim Sum, we ordered the \"old standard\" of Kung Pao Chicken. Though the pieces of chicken were of decent size and quality, the over meal had a sweet taste to it, and seriously lacked peppers and onions that give it a crunchy and distinctive flavor.  Good Chinese food in Las Vegas is very difficult to find. We owed it to our Yelp friends to try something new and hopefully found a tasty discovery to share with all.  Our disappointment is your gain. Strongly suggest you don't waste your time or dinning money on this place.  If you are a big fan of Dim Sum, put up with the crowds at Orchid Garden. Yum Cha wasn't crowded, Orchid Garden is almost always crowded. There's a reason for this contrast.  The taste of the Dim Sum.",

Not so here, they were actually very friendly and provided good service on top of reasonably priced, tasty Dim Sum. It is bright, airy, and open with plenty of seating which is a plus. They lost one star on this visit because the older gentleman who was asking \"how many\" looked me and my wife up and down making sure we weren't homeless. He was way too obvious in this and needs to work on being more discreet. We just needed to use the restroom before being seated. When mentioning it to a younger gentleman which I believe was the owner or manager, he informed us they had a real issue with homeless people using the restroom. We will definitely be back to give Yum Cha the opportunity to earn the fifth star because of our overall experience and our conversation on the way out with the man who's name eludes me. He gave us the impression they genuinely care about people's experiences.",

This place wasn't packed so there's no telling how long the shrimp dumplings been under the steam warmer.  If anything wait until they bring the fresh one from the kitchen before picking it from the steam cart. Fortunately there is a menu that you can ask the waiter to order which I recommend.   I would stay away from their fried taro root or any of their food in their glass case. Although the lady said it was fresh and made this morning there's no guarantee she's telling the truth and when you bite into one it didn't taste like it was made that morning.   The restroom does have a couple of funny signs though.",

The staff was friendly and the service was good but the food just wasn't worth coming back for. The chicken feet were over flavored and definitely had a lot of MSG in it. The taro cake (which they claimed was made in house, fresh) tasted like its previously frozen and thawed out then fried. The center wasn't even hot. It was slightly cold in the center The beef tendon I ordered turned out so mushy. It was so over cooked. I couldn't even eat it. The only decent items were the shrimp rice wrap (even though the  rice wrap was too thick) and the shirmp dumplings (the wrapper broke as I picked it up from the steamer). Even the tea was off. We ordered oolong and it tasted like pu-erh tea.  The bill was over $40 and I just didn't think it's worth it at all.",

We found Yum Cha on Yelp with promising ratings and reviews. I called them to inquire about the wait time for 6 and lucky for us there was one!  The restaurant has more of a \"hole-in-the-wall\" feel with typical Chinese diner style furnishings and metal dim sum carts. Complimentary iced water and hot jasmine tea are provided. Just like most dim sum restaurants, staff pushes around carts with very dim sum options.   Dishes that I enjoyed were: shrimp & pork shumais, shrimp dumplings, shrimp rice noodles, taro dumplings, and turnip cakes.  Dishes that I didn't enjoy very much were: baked BBQ pork buns, xiao long baos, and steamed BBQ pork buns.   The dim sum was a bit limited but they had a lot of solid choices and quick service. Good place to keep in mind if you're looking for a yummy dim sum restaurant in Vegas.",

We ordered our dims sum off the menu. Har gow, shumai, and beef noodle. We also ordered chow mein and salt and pepper pork. I mean, if you're going to go get some late night eats you might as well go big and order all the food.  Everything was great and the prices were typical. The dim sum dishes ran from $3 a piece. Family style entrees were around $10. Our server was friendly and came back to check on us a few times and refilled drinks quickly. Which was surprising, since you know how most Chinese restaurants are.   Will come back again! I would suggest checking to see when they have special weekday pricing on dim sum. It's like happy hour for shumai, that's a win!",

SUPERB customer service. That impressed me far more than anything else. I can't say I've been to a Chinese restaurant with such service as great as this place, especially dim sum where they can get pretty crazy busy and customers can get pretty demanding. Not here, they were busy but stayed professional, accommodating, and even apologetic for the siomai not being on point. They are a bit on the more expensive side for their dishes but you still get good food and good service. So all in all, it's a good dim sum place that hits the spot.",

A server with a cart comes by with many of these small Chinese dishes and you pick and choose what you want.  Turnip cake, fried taro, bbq pork bun, shrimp dumpling, chicken feet . . . they seem to have it all.  However, there is menu with pictures to choose larger dishes like salt and pepper calamari or General Tso's chicken (both were delicious).  Wash it down with some jasmine tea and then food coma time.  The food quality and prices were good but I gave a 4 due to the service being slow.

Steam spare ribs: 4/5 typical taste nothing good or bad here   Pork Buns: 3/5 not sure but I didn't see any baked BBQ buns I was craving those...   chicken feet: 4.5/5 okay so I DONT eat chicken feet but my family made me eat it! Lol on the real side I never eat this dish but they told me the flavors of this dish was off the hook so I tasted it. I gave it 4.5 so that tells you I really liked the flavors not the chicken feet of course lol   Tendon: 5/5 FIRST time ever I've seen this dish on a dim sum menu!! Flavors were great and so soft and <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>!!! Out of my mind that it tasted so good! I don't think it's a item that gets ordered a lot so we order a few of these and the last one came out late which they didn't get steamed long enough and the tendon felt like it just came out of the fridge.   Deep Fried Pork Belly: 0/5 do not get this dish! I know what Pork belly is and this shit ain't it! It was just a slab Of Pork floured and deep Fried! It as too salty and what a rip off! I was so mad bc I wanted PORK BELLY!   Fried Pork Dumplings: 3/5 took them forever to bring this item out I thought they forgot till the end of our lunch. Very Small fillings and not that much flavor to them.   Overall, not a bad experience the workers were great. Ohhhhhhh and their chili oil is a 5/5 can't have good dim sum without this side so yeayyyy!!!",

I was terrified because I often have dimsum so I know how the dish is supposed to taste. In this case, my friend didn't know the meat inside (pork wrapped in dumpling skin) still raw until I tried and pointed it out. He thought the chewy texture is how it's normally like. We notified the server and he offered to take that dish off the bill but I had lost my appetite I couldn't eat much more. I was so psyched to find out this place but the raw pork really brought me down. I wish they could have been more careful about cooking the food bc until now I still can't forget the feeling of chewing the raw piece of PORK and worrying so bad of getting sick.",

But when comparing it to other dim sum places in Las Vegas, Yum Cha is okay. We ordered a variety of the typical standard fare. Most dishes are bland but still palatable. I like the squash/pumpkin found in the black bean spare ribs but I think they were using it as fillers to give less meat. Food was served hot from the steamers and didn't appear to be reheated leftovers from the day before so that's a big plus. Don't forget to look at the heated bar holding some more food like congee with Chinese doughnuts and liver and tripe with daikon.  The staff was very attentive and the place was clean. Yum Cha, cute name and all, is a decent place to get your dim sum eats if you're in town but don't go in with high expectations.",

    "text": "Honestly, dim sum places in Vegas are not that impressive.  Yum cha has become my first choice when the craving hits.  There's a lot of positives to this place and a few misses.  What is most noticeable about this place is the customer service.  The workers speak a fair amount of English, which helps because they are able to explain the food they are offering and answer questions appropriately.  You'll always spot the man in the orange, who I assume runs the place.  He's always got a smile on his face and is constantly interacting with customers.  He's been prompt and follows through with specific dim sum orders we had.  Most dim sum places in town do not even go the extra mile and many workers come off rude. Not here!  I am not that adventurous and stick with the basic fare like: hargow, shu mai, char siu bao, beef/shrimp noodle, sticky rice, pineapple buns, egg tart, and sesame balls.  I did enjoy the quality and freshness of the food.  The pork shu mai was my least favorite since it was on the bland side.  The sticky rice, pineapple buns, and sesame buns were my favorite here.  I also liked that they offer roti here!  Another major difference here is the large glass counter/open kitchen where you can walk up and order dim sum beyond what is offered on food carts.  This is where you can get congee, fried rice, desserts, and more!    The space is large, airy, and very clean.  Location is situated on Tropicana/Decatur in the shopping center with Walgreens. Be aware on holiday weekends, this place will charge more (like $3+ for basic dim sum).  I feel like I spent a lot more than I would on dim sum that I had in the past from other places.  *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 53/100",

    "text": "Or should it be called Yummy Cha? I've been to four dim sum restaurants in the Las Vegas area and I have to say that Yum Cha is the best.  My husband and I visited Yum Cha  this past Saturday. As always, my husband scored a parking space right in front of the restaurant. As we were walking to the door, the door opened up for us and stayed opened. When we got there, one of the employees of the restaurant was holding the door open for us. I don't remember any restaurant doing that for me as soon as I get out of the car. So I was wow'd.  We walk in and the restaurant is huge and CLEAN! Double WOW!. We are seated, are drink orders are taken, I turn around and there's the dim sum cart. Triple WOW!   And the one cart has variety of options that it took us, what seemed like, less than 30-seconds to grab six dishes and 5-seconds to stuff our mouths with har gow and shumai when we realized, we didn't take a foodie pic. So in other words, we were hungry.  About a minute later, a second cart pulled up where we grabbed two more dishes and I was like, we have to slow down. Thank goodness my husband ordered chrysanthemum tea. And wait there's more. Whatever dim sum dishes they don't have on the cart, but is on the menu and as long as it was not a seasonal dish, you can order it and it is still the same weekend price of $3.58/each dish, $2.98/each on weekdays. So we ordered 3 more dishes.  Now it seems like we ordered a lot of food, and yah, it was, but keep in mind, depending on the size of the dim sum, it comes in 2s to 5s. Only two of the dishes were really bready, so we weren't filled up until we had the baked baos.  I have a lot of family and friends that visit. Yum Cha is definitely on the list of family lunch or dinner.  Fantastic job Yum Cha!",

Some dishes are already made and available in carts but some have to be ordered, which just guarantee hotness! Food came quick and service was attentive. Food wasn't bad but it wasn't great, it would definitely satisfy your cravings though. I recommend the lotus leaf pork sticky rice, fried dough wrapped in rice noodle, beef tripe, and radish cake.",

During \"off\" hours of dim sum, I appreciate that they make the items when you order them. I do find the prices a little high. I am here on a Monday night at 6:30p & there are only 2 tables beside mine. I had the Wonton Noodle Soup as well as Chive Dumplings. The soup was good. I do wish it had more vegetables in it. The Chive Dumplings (3 per order) ^small but tasty. They were a little on the greasy side. I might come back & try again.",

    "text": "Average dim sum in Las Vegas, but for the price you can't really complain. And what's nice about this place is that if you're craving dim sum, they serve it all day! That's a first, well, for me at least.   Nothing really stood out but they were all good enough to satisfy my hungry belly. They had all the typical dishes like har gow, chicken feet, and siu mai. Service is fine, nothing special. The restaurant is a asian looking for sure and very casual. No tablecloths, just a table, chairs, and a turn table. Pricing for the weekday and weekend different with the weekend prices being about $0.50 more for the dim sum. Cash only.  If you want some quality dim sum you're probably better off paying a little more to get that in the casinos. I prefer to go to the one in Rio. Though getting dim sum more off the strip is always easier.",

I like the idea of walking up to the counter to order your dim sum. It's definitely different from the authentic cart service but it allows you see everything they have to offer and not have to wait for the cart to reach you. However, their selections were very limited when we went on a weekday. Only half the display station was filled with dim sum options. They had your typical hargow, Shumai, sticky rice and chashu bau but not much more. Wish they had more items to try didn't feel like I got a real dim sum experience. Maybe it's better on the weekend? I don't know but what I did try was just okay. Definitely not the best I've had and just okay. Would I come back? Probably not. Would I recommend it? Probably not.",

My favorite dish is the Curry chicken noodles and I like the roti. If you go here try the traditional egg custards. They are made from scratch daily and often run out.

We stumbled upon Yum Cha & I am so glad that we did. Every piece from the taro puff, to all of the various dumplings met our expectations and more! My personal favorite was the flat white steamed noodle with steamed shrimp. The sauce that was added to it before being served was absolutely delicious!  For desert, the custard buns had my name written all over it. First bite in and you're greeted with an explosive flavor of soft bun. Sweet and decadent custard filling and a bit of custard crunch on the top. All 3 mixed together tastes perfect! The staff was very friendly and we're always on top of things whenever we needed something. If you happen to be in he area and are craving great dim sum and Chinese food. Yum Cha is the spot.",

Once we mentioned we eat seafood only, they suggested great options.  - Food was freshly prepared.  - Food quality is so great. Very tasty & definitely not greasy.  - Good size on the Tofu Fa - Very clean & well managed restrooms - They have diaper changing table on both Ladies & Mens restrooms. - First restrooms in chinese & asian restaurants I know that use a touchless soap dispensers  Con: Other than too greasy on fried items, & some stained on the chair, we almost couldn't find any negative side of them.",

They have a lady walking around pushing dimsum cart, she has all selections of steam ones but if you want any fried dimsum or veggie you can walk up to the counter to see their selections and order from there or order it from your server.

Restaurant refused to honor $25 certificate obtained just days ago, claiming they have not participated in the program for a while, yet it is still listed on the website today. Get it together or just honor the promotion as a courtesy. We splurged since there was a $50 minimum. Big mistake as our bill ended up over $70 for 2 adults/2 kids. A bit pricey for a 'casual' lunch.  Decent dim sum, was a bit cold as we dined later in the afternoon. The freshly steamed dishes were fine. Not the best dim sum but not the worst either. A bit pricey at $3.50-$4+ a dish  ($1+ for each morsel). At that price point Ping Pang Pong @ Gold Coast is better. Service was quick and attentive but it was not busy when we went.  And in case you noticed this place has large number of good reviews - they reward positive reviews by bribing reviewers with free dim sum - shady.",

So after a day in Red Rock Canyon we came in for dinner.   Holy smokes this place is remarkable. The Dim Sum was fantastic.  We enjoyed the Tarro Root which looks like a birds nest. It was yummy.  We had shrimp and spinach dumpling, chive dumpling and some tofu dumpling.  The dessert Dim Sum was amazing. One had a coconut filling and the other was a sesame seed red bean ball.   Well we live in So Cal and are here on vacation.  This will be our first of many Dim Sum dinners at Yum Cha.    The staff was great! We were promptly greeted and though we love Dim Sum they explained everything and recommend some things too! Great service !  Ps looks like it's large enough for large party's and receptions.  Lastly this is the cleanest place I've ever seen. They have a lot of pride in their family run restaurant!",

I expected an authentic experience followed by delicious food and great customer service. Unfortunately, I came out a little disappointed.  Although the food wasn't terrible - I wouldn't have considered it great either. The shumai & rice cake lacked a lot of flavor. On the flip side, however, the steamed char siu bun was delicious. That's the only dish we ordered multiple times.  The wait & cook staff were pre-occupied while 3 employees went on a dinner break at the same time. I could literally see them eating their In-N-Out burgers while the rest of us required assistance. I was left with an empty water cup for almost 30 minutes! (My biggest restaurant pet peeve). There were other people around us complaining as well.   Excellent customer service could have saved the rest of my issues with the restaurant. However, based off of this experience - I don't think I will be back anytime soon.",

They have some common dim sum dishes/tapas and some really authentic dishes (the kind that you have to acquire a palate for). The owner of the restaurant stopped by our table multiple times to explain that the items were made daily and that some of the items we ordered take a while to heat up, but she assured us repeatedly that the dishes were delicious.

Puts some distinctive dim sum place in Orange County back in Cali to shame.   Their sweet bbq pork bun (the one with the sweet, shiny, sticky coating on the brown bun - not the white soft steamed bun) is LEE-GIT. DENSE, HEAVY and FILLED with filling. Physically pick one up and you'll find that it's quite heavy in comparison to dinky other ones elsewhere. We ordered two more orders and took it with us in the car for the ride home.

I was overall surprised because I honestly didn't think you could get delicious dim sum in NV. The best part was the service was excellent along with the delicious food.  This location is a mixture of your cart dim sum where you pick your items from the carts that are pushed by your table and ordering from the menu to your table. I say this is a mixture because they usually only have 1-3 carts floating around and they have tons of wait staff to come and get your order, also some items are order only.   They make all their dim sum fresh to order and it taste that way! Another note, their baked BBQ Pork buns are jumbo size so be warned not to order too much!  Come early because they do get very busy and a wait does form.",

Dehydrated, we begged for tall glasses of ice water.   Service here was phenomenal. They took our order right away. They kept refilling our water and our tea. Bite by bite, we were slowly coming back to life. The dim sum was very fresh and piping hot. We were so so so content coming here. Will definitely be back if I'm craving dim sum next time I'm in Vegas.",

Had to make it a point to come here with my mom, because you know, asian parents love dimsum. LOL  I have to say it was really nice to have a place that serves dimsum all day long, especially when most places stop at 2pm or 3pm.  Good selection of dimsum, most items are driven on a cart, some specialty items are kept closer to the counter and are made to order. Understandably, as you don't expect a full time dimsum chef back in the kitchen making dimsum all day, there are some items that are decent under heat lamps. I really cannot badmouth anything as they were just as good.  The lava custard buns were delicious, not too sweet; the meatballs weren't excessively greasy and did not taste like baking soda. (some places are notorious for marinating it with lots of soda to tenderize the meat) The beef rice crepes were also delicious, not too thick, and not too salty. It is worth the detour. The palace had a nice asian tea house feel with birdcages hung on top; really quaint and a relaxing atmosphere; good place to come and gossip like asian ladies and spill tea. The prices were really decent too! did not break the bank! stuffed ourselves with dimsum for 4 people and barely spent $75. Would come back!",

The prices are nearly twice that of Orchids Garden whose food quality is very comparable.  Although some of the dishes we ordered were made to order and tasted better as a result, many of the dishes we had suffer from the same problem of just being a little old from sitting around. You can taste how old dim sum is even if it is reheated.  They do seem to have a bit more variety, but it doesn't seem very significant. Honestly, I didn't eat anything that I couldn't get at another lower priced restaurant.  So go here if you don't feel like driving a few more minutes and saving a few bucks for essentially the same experience. It'll probably be okay.",

Either the service is slow or the chefs are slow but only one dish comes out at a time. And after you finish one dish, the next comes out five mins later. I like my dim sum experience to be a spread... With all of it in front of me at once so I can pick and choose what I want to eat. This place serves it in courses. Nothing comes out together.   Also there were some mix ups with our ordering. A dish never came out and we had to ask them to check on stuff because food was slow to come. I thought the food tasted fine but my no means one of the best.  Also, this place has the basic types of dim sum but the menu is small compared to other restaurants. The variety was fine for me but you won't find any specialty dishes here.",

    "text": "Get your yum cha on at Yum Cha! Came with a group for a daylight savings dim sum brunch. There are carts, hot pot items, a cafeteria-style counter, and a full menu for special orders and entrees. They seem to have a few more traditional items than the few other dim sum spots in town, but unfortunately even with the selection YC isn't about to compete with CA's shops so scale back your expectations.  Some favorite items were the radish cake (so crispy!), the chive pancakes (stuffed with filling!), the taro dumpling (crispy without being greasy), and the lava custard bun (a new item for me). We also got some of my go-to orders of hargow, shrimp and chive dumplings, shrimp rice noodle, and BBQ pork bun. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with some other items: salt and pepper calamari didn't have much salt or pepper seasoning and the Xiao Long Bao soup dumplings weren't soupy, for example.    Food quality was pretty decent for most items and the service was really a lot better than I've experienced elsewhere- cart ladies were helpful about showing and describing their items, constantly giving drink refills, clearing plates, and asking for additional orders. Pricing was pretty fair too, at about $20/person for our feast.",

    "text": "I haven't had dim sum in a while, so I was hoping for good things out of this newer spot. I wasn't disappointed.  Yum Cha is a dim sum restaurant located in the Walgreens plaza at the southwest corner of Tropicana and Decatur. Its name is literally the term for eating dim sum, but they do have a menu of other items which my group (Stefany V., Bethany E., and other friends) ignored while we had our Sunday \"brunch\" (boozeless as it was).  There is also a picture menu of the various dim sum items, which is helpful not just to non-Chinese speakers, but also for just seeing the entire breadth of the selection that this place serves. Regular items are $2.88 on weekdays and $3.28 on weekend/holidays, and they appear to be available from carts that circle the spacious room. Other typical dim sum items are priced in the $3.98-$5.98 range, and these were actually cooked in the kitchen to-order.  Needless to say, I tried quite an array of items. My favorite were as follows:  Taro Dumpling ($3.98) - one of my favorites to order anywhere, a pork-filled taro treat with a crispy exterior that wasn't as greasy as expected.  Shrimp Rice Noodle ($3.98) - shrimp and rice wrapper both were cooked right, and it just hit the spot.  Chicken Feet ($3.28) - a fall-apart treat marinated in a nice sauce, not too try and with a gelatinous texture. As always, this is simply fun to eat, even with the multitude of bones.  Shrimp & Pork Shumai ($3.28) - ground meat in a wrapper, and one of the most flavorful renditions that I've had in a while.  Radish Cake ($3.98) - a surprisingly crispy version, perhaps because it was cooked fresh instead of being carted around in a container and losing the subtle crunch due to steam. Didn't even need soy sauce on this.  Bake Lava Custard Bun ($3.98) - they didn't have egg tarts available for some reason, but this was a great alternative. Another nice exterior, moist yet cooked sweet dough, and a sweet interior that's smooth but not silky - by that, I mean that there's a bit of texture, but nothing off-putting. It wasn't served hot though, so the interior didn't really flow.  -----  I was pretty happy with the other items too, including Har Gow (\"Shrimp Dumpling\"), Steam BBQ Pork Bun, Beef (meat)Ball, Steam Pork Ribs, Beef Tripe, Veggie Egg Noodle, and Salt & Pepper Calamari. I should note that the Xiao Long Bao was enjoyable, but it clearly does not meet the expectation of a soupy dumpling; I could tell despite not having much if any experience with this much sought-after speciality.  I will definitely return to Yum Cha some time to yum cha. The offerings here are reasonably priced, generally delicious and among the best that I've tried in this town's not-particularly-known-for-dim-sum scene. I wasn't completely blown away by most of the items, but I wasn't outright disappointed by anything as I have been at other places. I definitely missed out on trying some items, and I will have to rectify that issue in the future.",

    "text": "What a great find that is chinatown-adjacent. The interior is not crowded and not overly fancy. It's very clean. Slightly strange quirk: the tv is playing videos of cooking demos of Indian street food.   The menu is divided into a dim sum menu and an entree menu. We only ordered the dim sum so I can't make any comments about the entrees. Each order came out relatively quickly. Pay attention to the pictures on the menu as the number of pieces shown is what you get per order.   The xiaolongbao were good. Slightly doughy but not too soupy. Great flavor. The steamed buns had a generous amount of filling compared to the dough. Great flavor in the pork buns. Our waitress also said there will be BBQ chicken buns after Lunar New Year.   The real standout was the curry and potato puff. It is similar to a samosa but different. Delicious though.   For dessert I always get an egg tart. It was quite good but not as good as you'd find in Hong Kong. The waitress says the custard buns are the specialty so I'll have to make a point to try those next time.   In all this was a great find for dim sum. We spent about $50 for two and had more than our fill. The only downside to the pricing is that there are only two price tiers (where most places have Four or five). This makes some items a steal and some kind of expensive.   The service was great. The waitress was really happy to talk about the menu and keep us engaged in the choices. Everyone was super friendly and I definitely didn't get the feeling that I was being a dumb white boy. Go check this place out and eat all the dumplings.",

I like this place much more than the ones in Chinatown , but maybe not as much as the ones in the casinos.  We came here for lunch which is the proper time to eat dim sum anyways. What caught my attention is that this place is very clean plus the prices are not that bad (compared to other places like Chang's right down the street). They serve dim sum all day which is cool. You can order dim sum off the menu & you can walk up to the open food bar. It seemed like there were not that many carts were going around but we had no problem having our waiter take our orders. I just wish there were more carts going around for the dim sum experience.  They have typical dishes like congee , shumai , har gow , chicken feet , etc. All the food is served piping hot. It surprised me that they have roti w/ curry here. The roti was perfectly cooked but the curry was alright. It was a bit oily. For dessert , I usually get egg tarts or red bean sesame balls at dim sum but the custard bun was definitely my favorite here. I enjoyed breaking open the custard bun and dipping it in the custard filling. Tea is extra here which I found a bit odd since it's usually free at other places.  This place is pretty big so it's great for large groups and families. It's on Tropicana/Decatur located opposite of International Market. It's a decent place to get your dim sum eats but don't go in with super high expectations.",

I decide to take one more bite of the beef tripe before packing the food up and notice a long strand of hair in it. I quietly mention it to the guy (I don't know if he was the owner but he was older and rude af). He acts like he doesn't see it & asks me to hold it up to the light. He then proceeds to make jokes about how it's probably my hair before taking it back to the kitchen. Mind you, my hair is BLACK AND GREEN OMBRE and the hair in the food was a lightish brown, almost blonde. He returns with some oversized muffin looking things and says here I'll give you these free, even though it might be your hair. At this point I'm so annoyed, I push the muffins back at him & tell him I'm leaving, just give me the check. He insists on us taking the free pastries, when I literally just have to blurt out I don't want the shit and just give me my check. The dim sum & wait staff was solid, this guy was just a total dick with no customer service skills. I will NEVER be back. Ps: most of the food was good, their salt & pepper squid is salty to an EXTREME and the jellyfish salad had a whole cup of sesame seeds as a topping.",

I have been to several dim sum restaurants in San Francisco and the Bay Area (Yank Sing is awesome, even if overpriced), and Yum Cha meets and in some cases exceeds those places. Flavor, choices, prices... All on point. Will be back and anyone in the Las Vegas area, support this local gem!!",

    "text": "My Family and I live in Vegas for little over two years, from San Diego. Tried so many dim sum places and we have never pleased with the TASTE, FRESHNESS, AUTHENTICITY, CLEANLINESS, and ATTITUDE. Finally we have found a PERFECT THE BEST DIM SUM PLACE IN VEGAS - YUM CHA. My wife and I were so happy, even my 4 years old daughter love the food. At the end of the meal, Sam the owner stopped by at our table. We asked him what should we have for dessert, he recommended us to have their signature 'Lava Custard Bun' OMG  we were blown away, they were so awesome... Sweet, little salty on the Custard and perfect crust on top of the bun. Guys, you guys got to believe me... I'm really picky on the food, always want to make things right and perfect. I grew up in the Restaurant-Hospitality industry. I would like to take this opportunity to share my idea with Sam, I think would be better if they add another hot sauce on the table - their own SIGNATURE HOT SAUCE.  With their magic ingredients combination, will make them different than any other places just using chili oil and sambal oelek.  We will be back Sam, You and your Team are doing an excellent job! Thank you.",

We ordered shumai, hargow,  pork buns (steamed and baked), shrimp and beef rice noodle, beef ball. All the food was on point! The service was great as well, I tend to drink my water really fast and I could honestly say that I did not have a empty glass the entire time. Everyone was really nice there so it felt like I've been going there for months even though it was only my first time. They serve dim sum all damn day too which is amazing!!!!

Overall, I would say our experience at Yum Cha was disappointing. Not sure why it got so many stars. The biggest disappointment here was the beef (and shrimp version as well) wrapped in rice noodle dim sum, that was unfortunate as those are my kids favorite dim sum dish. I don't understand how they can mess this one up as it's probably the most common dim sum dish.  The sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf was also disappointing, no filling inside. I mean literally nothing inside!  The other dishes we had, such as the steamed tripe, fried taro, steamed roast pork buns, beef chow fun (ordered from kitchen), was good.  I'm comparing this to dim sum restaurants I've been to in the NY/NJ areas and having eaten dim sum for over 30 years. :)",

My wife and I came here 5 minutes after they opened on a Saturday morning and all the items we ordered (14 dishes) were excellent quality, texture and flavors, and even their presentation.   This is not a typical dim sum parlor where everything comes around in carts. Several items - probably their most popular ones - come around on the carts. But then you can also walk up to the \"sample bar\" where they prepare lots of pan fried dim sum dishes and order several other varieties of dim sum. You can also order from a server if you can flag one down. It's a creative approach and worked well for me.   The service was attentive as they did a great job of making sure we got everything we wanted, and always filled our tea pot and water glasses. We would highly recommend Yum Cha and we will definitely be back here.",

I'm always on the look out for new dimsum restaurants to try that are comparable to Hong Kong style dim sum. Our usual spot is KJ Dim Sum but service can be hit or miss and we didn't feel like going to a casino. From the minute we walked in to the minute we left Yum Cha service was very inviting and friendly. Every worker smiled, they all spoke very well english, very friendly and just made our experience comfortable. We came in around 2:30pm for a late lunch and learned that carts stop coming around the tables after 2pm due to its generally their slow time. They move all the dim sum to behind the glass counter where you pick what you want or you can simply tell the server what dishes you want and they'll bring it to your table. Our tea and water was refilled constantly. My husband and I especially enjoyed the shrimp stuffed eggplant here! Shumai, har gau, char siu bao and lotus sticky rice were all tasty. We'll definitely be back. Would like to try some of their non-dim sum dishes.",

I can't go without coconut buns and their bread/pastries are really good.",

    "text": "Our experience with the service at this joint was horrendous today. First the greeter attempted to seat us near the front door where the cold air was blowing in.  There were plenty of empty tables or booths further in.  Reluctantly the greeter seated us just a slight bit further from the front.  The place then started to pack and the chaos began.  Instead of waiting for the dim sum carts to come around, the other customers either redirected the carts to their table or went up to the carts to pick their food.  Some crowded at the counter and grabbing food from there.  There was no civility or order.  It was like a horde of starving people in a soup kitchen.  We managed to get some dishes off a near empty cart that came by.  I thought eating dim sum or yum cha is supposed to be a relaxing experience when friends can chat over the meal.  I tried to order food off the menu from a server,  he just walked away and never came back.    After 15 minutes with no carts coming to our area, I finally got the attention of another server.  I asked him why the carts are not coming over.  He didn't answer.  I told him to bring us the bill and we are leaving.  His response was \"Good, leave\". I take back my previous rating and changed it to one star because this type of service.  During our previous visit, Elaine who I believe to be the manager had asked us to each recommend 3 friends to patronize this joint.  If Elaine or staff member of this joint read this review update (which I doubt), we will tell our friends not to patronize this joint.  Today was within the winter holiday, it appears most of today's customers were from out-of-town.  This joint's owner or manager should realize it is the locals that support their business year round.  We are taking our business back to Chang's down the street.",

When we asked about dishes that didn't come after over an hour, we were told that they ran out already.  No one communicated this to us. Then, we saw people coming out of the kitchen with the dishes that they allegedly ran out of! Unbelievable.  In all fairness, the food was quite good.

It was not hard to find since we use to eat at the same establishment in the past when it used to be a buffet.  Yum Cha did not disappoint at all.  We came in on a slow time so service was very fast.  Menu is your typical dimsum menu; crab/shrimp balls, shumai, chickent feet, pork bun, short ribs, stir fried egg noodles, etc.  Servers were pretty good in recommending items in their menu.  They weren't even recommending anything on the high priced list.  Ended with a baked custard bun which was  the perfect finish to our meal.",

I only gave it 4 stars because it kind of took a while for them to bring out the food with only a few tables being served.. also some of the dim sum dishes weren't hot. And they had a sign that said \"free dim sum when you check in Yelp or google\" so I asked if one of my dim sum was free but they just said they usually give a free steamed pork bun.. Maybe they should change that sign.   Overall, if you're craving dim sum.. This is a good place to go.",

I'm native to the Bay Area, so it's difficult to compare, but this was just an average place and there are plenty of better places to eat in LV.  The food doesn't come out hot (at least the time we went there). They told us, the  dim sum is cold because that's how white people like it. Example, friend shrimp wasn't hot when it came out.  The pieces are smaller than I am used to. That didn't matter because the dim sum didn't really taste that good. We ordered shrimp, pork, chicken feet, pig stomach, sticky rice (my wife said it was the worst she ever tasted). The pig stomach had good flavor and the best dish was the beef stew.  Also, the pricing isn't quite clear. We went to this place as a result of a newspaper ad and the prices looked pretty darn cheap $2.99. Note, not everything is that price and the tiers are a little different than I am used to. Some dishes that should be the A category aren't.  All in all, we were fed. I don't think anyone got sick in our party, but this place leaves something to be desired.",

The food and the quality of the food was well above average and the price was fantastic.  Everyone needs to try this place, even if you are not into Dim Sum",

I like the idea of them coming to your table and you just pin point what you want. Hahaha if there's a dish I wasn't familiar with; they fully inform me and best described the dish. The only thing I wasn't fan of was there's other dishes at the counter but you have to get up let them know and they bring it to your table. It would of been better if they had a small menu for that at the table for convenience... Otherwise, I will definitely come again.",

The basics like Siu Mai, sesame balls, chicken feet were all good. Shrimp dumplings were amazing, they were so good we had to have more. I really wanted different varieties of the dumplings.

For two people who had about 10-12 dishes our meal ended up being 40$! If anyone else I know wants to eat dim sum I would definitely recommend coming back to this location.

It's nice that it's away from the hustle and bustle of Chinatown (and not as far as Sahara for Lotus Garden). You never have to murder someone in the parking lot to find a space either LOL. Also, all the times i've been there, there is little to no wait time.   Since there is no cart service available, all the food tastes fresh and made to order. Their chive dumplings are bomb, and the baked BBQ buns make me drool every time! The buns are toasted perfectly with the right amount a sweet, and they're stuffed with a lot of meat. The xiaolongbao are also the best i've had in Vegas so far! They're filled with piping hot soup and the skins aren't too thick like other places.   The also have the rest of the dimsum standards (siomai, hargow, chicken feet, etc.) but the ones I mentioned earlier are the best. Service is friendly; they take the time offer suggestions, and the owners or managers stopped by to talk to us.   Issa must try for dimsum lovers!  TLDR; a rly chill place with fresh & tasty buns/dumplings!!",

I came here on a Wednesday around 1pm with one other person.  Once we arrived we were seated immediately and carts were pushed to us.  They had everything a normal dim sum place would have but even more items.  Like a lot more!  I like that they had everything steaming hot and there were more items on their menu.  You are bound to find something you like.  Everything we tried was delicious and tasted like they had just made it.  I don't normally get desserts but we ended up even getting some goods for our hotel.  We got their sesame balls, egg tarts, and egg custard filled sweet rolls.  All were amazing and so amazing.  Our total for our food was only $19.  The desserts was an extra $10.  It was very worth it.    The owner was really nice to us.  The girls serving us and pushing the carts were also very friendly and sweet.  The inside is very large with plenty of chairs, tables, and booths.  It's super casual.  You can walk up to where they are preparing food and also order there.  I cannot wait to come back here.",

I grew up going to some of the best dim sum restaurant in San Francisco's Chinatown so I admit I have high expectations. The highlights were the black mushroom suimai and the spareribs. The rest was passable but not worth what we paid. The ha gow and shrimp wrapped in batter was not good. Shrimp was rubbery and the batter was greasy. With so many other options in Vegas... I would skip this one.",

    "text": "Oh happy day!!! I FINALLY found a delicious dim sum restaurant here in Las Vegas...where to begin on all this food happiness?  Located on South Decatur (South West part of Vegas) This place is easy to get to from I215 or Decatur.     Inside the place is huge, lots of seating including booths AND large round tables.   Side note***they're getting set up to have a Cafe which will soon be open for business (if you like bubble tea, boba tea etc.) additionally, they're waiting on a liquor license so stay tuned for being able to order wine, beer  and other adult beverages!!!  Ambiance: totally chill so no need to dress up, this place is casual all the way.   Service: EXCELLENT!!! Our order was taken promptly, our drinks were always full and any time we looked like we wanted to order more dim sum, our server was there. Very nice, professional and absolutely spot on with our orders.   Food: absolutely delicious! We ordered three kinds of dumplings, spiced sticky rice  wrapped in leaf , spare ribs, chicken feet, fried pork belly, bok choy, sesame and red bean rice balls. That's just 1/4 of what the menu has to offer.   Price: all that food ^---- was literally less than $40 and it fed two people. So yes, this place rocks my socks off...yes YOU should come here and try the dim sum (they have a Chinese food menu too if you want that) and yes you had better bring your appetite!!!     Cheers!",

The ambiance is authentic and made me feel like I was traveling in Asia.  There is a dim sum menu and you can order from the menu or you can get plates from the dim sum cart that rolls around. We tried both approaches, but I have to say I preferred being able to look at the menu to know what I was getting.  While ordering from the cart we asked what things were and ordered some banana leaf pouches which we were told were 'sticky rice' just to open them and realize it was sticky rice with generous portions of pulled pork inside.. It was delicious but my non-pork eating boyfriend was not happy about having taken a bite..  Our other picks included shrimp dumplings, noodle soup and steamed chicken buns. Everything was delicious and at a great price.  I LOVED the chili oil that was on our table and it was the perfect accompaniment to the meal.  Great spot!",

The food was good and had an authentic taste. Enjoyed the variety including beef tendon, which I haven't previously seen at most dim sum restaurants. Since they push carts, some of this dishes had been sitting out for a while, but you could also order specialty dim sum items from the back. Overall, would come back if I lived in the area, but as a tourist was not easily assessable from the strip.",

    "text": "My husband & I had been talking about trying Dim Sum for the first time and we turned to Yelp and came across Yum Cha. Since this was our first Dim Sum experience, we can't compare it to any other places and this review is solely on today's visit.   The restaurant is located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. When we walked in we were immediately greeted and seated. The inside is pretty big. Besides us there were only 2 other people dining at the time. By the time we left there were only 2 other tables occupied. The service was excellent. There were 2 ladies & 1 gentleman who constantly came by to refill our water, clear our plates and take our orders.   We had the following based on our choices as well as our server's recommendations:  Shrimp & Pork Shumai Steamed BBQ Pork Bun Shrimp & Pork Chives Dumpling  Shrimp Rice Noodle BBQ Pork Puff Pastry Pan Fried Potstickers  Fried Shrimp Ball Xiao Long Bao  Red Bean Sesame Ball   The dishes come anywhere between 2-4 pieces and range in price from $3.68, $4.38 & $4.98 depending on which page you choose from.   Our favorites were the Steamed BBQ Pork Bun, Shrimp & Pork Chives Dumpling & the Fried Shrimp Ball. Our least favorite was the Shrimp Rice Noodle. Everything came out hot except for the Red Bean Sesame Ball which was disappointing because those are best nice and hot. Some of the dishes came with some dipping sauces and overall the flavors were good.   We quickly flipped through the menu and they also serve Chinese food as well as lunch specials. But today we stuck with the Dim Sum.   Would we come back again? Possibly. If you're like us and are first time Dim Sum-mers I would say Yum Cha is a good place to start!",

Almost everything we had tasted like it had been frozen and heated up. The only thing we thought might have been homemade was the spicy shrimp wonton & the steamed bok choi (but dear lord how hard is that). The spicy shrimp wonton took much longer to come out, which I didn't mind, and actually had some flavor. On that note I will say they were fast at bringing out items, but I'd rather them take their time so we get better quality food. Maybe I've just had good dim sum and I'm too particular? .....I don't think that's the problem here ;)",

I would give the food about a 2, but the service was so awesome that I had to give it an extra star. The calamari was non-existent, so it felt like I was just eating batter and salt. Literally, fried batter with nothing in it. The tripe was decent and the lava custard was pretty good. Everything else was soggy. I'm not sure if I'll be back here, but I tried! My last round, I ordered the pork ribs, stuffed mushrooms, and pork and chive dumplings. For some reason, something smelled really off. It turned me Off and wasn't sure what dish it was. It was strong, like something went bad. My heart told me to stop eating, so I did. We ended our meal with the lava custard, which was delicious.

He came over several times to check on us and made sure we were happy with the food as well as the service. He also asked for our suggestions and constructive comments. I have been to so many popular dim sum places in town and generally I never get good customer service. If they're not ignoring your request then they're basically throwing the food on your table and walking away. This place was an exception. I was very happy with the service I received today. Overall, I think the food was good in flavors, selections were various and customer service was outstanding. I will definitely come back.",

We have a favorite place to go where we're from so I'm always apprehensive about trying new places because I don't want to be disappointed. We got a craving so I looked to Yelp.  I found and tried this place based on Yelp reviews and once again I'm pleased!   We ordered dim sum items and some wonton soup. We had shrimp, pork/shrimp, and shrimp/spinach dumplings. We also had the beef crepe that comes with this amazing sauce, a tofu item, pan-fried pork dumplings and some black bean spareribs.   Everything tasted amazing! It was delicious and fresh. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because we waited for the wonton soup and then got all the way home and realized it wasn't in the bag.   The food was so good that we weren't even mad. I will definitely be going back to this place before I go back to CA.",

Additionally, the open food stall allows one to point other foods to have brought to your table. Dim sum prices range from $3 -$5 for lunch.  The dim sum features pork, shrimp, sweet and savory.

    "text": "Prologue: One of our dining traditions when visiting Las Vegas is to try at least one new Asian restaurant. After perusing several reviews on Yelp we decided that this trip would include some dim sum at Yum Cha.  The Plot: My girlfriend and I shared a variety of traditional dim sum, including chicken feet, sticky rice with pork in lotus leaf, rice noodle with shrimp, beef short ribs, and beef tendon.  The Scene: My girlfriend, who is a native of mainland China, and I agreed that the chicken feet and sticky rice with pork were as good as we've had anywhere. The beef tendon, which was perfectly cooked to the optimal degree of tender, rich, gelatinous yummyness was quite satisfying.   The Rest of the Story: The service was intermittent and challenging at times. The rice noodle with shrimp was cold and the sauce was a little weak. The beef short ribs were tasty but not nearly tender enough.  Epilogue: The relatively limited dim sum menu was a somewhat unpleasant surprise considering how many good reviews this restaurant has received.  That fact alone dropped our review from 5 stars to 4. Combine the limited menu with the sketchy service and cold rice noodles and the best review we can legitimately give is 3 stars.  Photo design by Billie Z.",

There's an odd menu system where if you don't see it on the cart you can order it, but what's the point of that with dim sum?!? Shu mai was pretty good, everything else was fair to poor. Greasy dumplings, heavy pork buns, just not a fan. If people truly think this is the best dim sum in Vegas they need to get to LA, SF, or Portland to try really good dim sum.",

If you come late (past brunch time) the \"cart\" experience is not there, but you can still order the full menu and they make it to order.   This place is a little quirky, with fake bird cages all over the ceiling and TVs showing cooking videos from various Asian counties. The restaurant is also large with ample seating for small to big parties. Although, I'm not sure how busy this place gets on weekend mornings (as mentioned, not an early riser). The staff are bi-lingual and do a good job of explaining what each item is for those who are unfamiliar. They are quick to refill tea/water and are on top of their stuff!  Been here about 3-4 times mostly because the dim sum is all-day. But that's okay because the food is actually really good! Each plate comes out hot and fresh. They have everything from the typical har gow, and shumai to xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and curry fish balls, which aren't usual dim sum fare. However, I do think it's a little on the pricey side for some dishes like the beef tripe, entrails, & radish.   Yum Cha is great if you want that dim sum fix, and don't want to get up early. It's not the best I've ever had, but it's pretty darn good.",

The lava bun the custard was really flavorful but a little grainy. Overall we were thrilled with the meal.",

It was not busy, there was only one couple sitting in one of the booths and the rest of the place was empty, but it was also a time of day when most are just leaving work (5:15pm). This did not worry me because I felt we would be given swift service and lots of attention to detail, which we did! From the Jasmine tea to the soup dumplings, everything was flavorful and fresh tasting!  I left very full, not heavy full but satisfying full.  The price was surprising (in a good way) the three of us had 10 dishes and it came to $42.00 and change, I was expecting almost double that, it helps the there is a lower price during the week (approximately $2.88 per dish vs. approximately $3.68 per dish weekends and holidays).  The staff was so helpful in making suggestions and keeping the tea and water full, and just friendly in general.  Our server was very honest about what she thought we would like and she never tried to \"trick\" us into ordering more dishes.  She was also very forthcoming about what the crowd and environment is like during the busier lunch time hour (they only do cart service during the early part of the day through lunch due to the volume of customers). Every dish we ordered tonight was freshly prepared and came to the table hot and delicious. I live 45 minutes away and used a 1/4 tank of gas and it was worth it!!! Thank you Yum Cha, you have a big fan in me and my two friends, we will be back with more newbies soon!!!!",

Their English, however, was very poor. I had trouble communicating with the staff. They tried to do it a little different here. The standard dim sum dishes are in the carts being pushed around but their \"special\" dishes are behind a counter where you walk up and order. The order then gets brought to your table. I don't know if that's necessary but I guess you don't have to scour the carts looking for dishes. To me the flavors weren't good. I left feeling like I was missing something.

All the dim sum staples we tried were very good. Had some delicious sticky rice and a nice serving of crispy pork belly. Also had a good bowl of congee. The owner Sam came over to make sure everything was ok. We struck up a conversation about Malaysia and the great food you can find there. His staff's service was great and he personally asked what could be done better. Now that's customer service! The place is new so hopefully the locals will support it and make it thrive.

The dim sum is really good: the har cow (shrimp in rice dumpling) and shu mai (pork and shrimp wonton style dumpling are my favorite.  I also really liked the wonton soup.  The owner is really nice and makes people feel good around him.  Another plus is they have free wifi and electrical plugs at the booth tables so I can sit here and work while i eat or have business meetings here.  Five stars - try it!",

Compared to NYC dimsum, this place isn't ... that great. What makes up for it though is the great service and quickness in which the food arrives! I highly recommend ordering the fried sticky rice. I never had sticky rice that was \"fried\" but now I'm on a search for that in NYC. I DO NOT recommend the xiao long bao because it was a measly portion of 3 mini bao's that had the flavor of cardboard. My boyfriend liked the egg plant stuffed with fish paste dish so I recommend that. Lastly, they charge $1.00 per person for tea (which surprised me because in NYC tea comes for free!) Nevertheless, they have many tea options (black, red, chrysanthemum etc.) They're open until about 10:30pm, so if you're craving late night dimsum this is the place to go.",

Those dishes came out a bit cold, the rice noodles were a little thicker than usual, and the shrimps were also smaller compared to other places.  However, the shrimp balls were better than other places. It was really big and crispy. They paired it with this spicy orange mayonnaise sauce instead of the tradition sweet and sour red sauce.

Everyone was very attentive. I literally looked up from the menu for one second and the waiter was over to ask if I wanted to put in an order. It's no secret that many Chinese restaurants usually don't have the best customer service sometimes but I really enjoyed my experience here. For being prime time for dim sum, it was fairly slow but it was a Tuesday morning.  The menu included several options and offered detailed photos of the food items. I was impressed that some classic dim sum entrees offered a chicken or pork option (siu mai). We ordered the chicken siu mai, har gao (shrimp dumplings), char siu bao (pork buns), har cheung (shrimp noodle rolls with sauce), and the egg custard buns (which were ginormous, the photo in the menu was not an exaggeration). I'm picky when it comes to dim sum, but everything was very fresh and delicious! My eyes were far hungrier than my stomach and I really wanted the egg tarts and mango pudding, but that's something I'll have to try next time.   The restaurant was very clean and you had a clear view of the kitchen area.",

    "text": "This place was an all day Dim Sum in Vegas. When we walked in, it was about 2-3pm on a Thursday. Only us and another table. You walk in and can see the kitchen right away. The staff was very friendly.  Place is huge w lots of space and TVs everywhere.  Menu was pretty decent so we ordered a few dishes to try out.  Dim sum wasn't bad, but don't order off the menu. I ordered the Hai NaN Chicken dish, which I've had very many times before. I was disappointed w this one. Rice had a really weird flavor, chicken was dry, and the two sauces were bland. This was a $10+ Dish too. I only ate the bok choy that was served w it and left the whole plate untouched. My hubby tired the chicken and agreed on how dry it was.  If you come here, stick w the dim sum. It was not bad, but since I've had PPP, I feel that this place is beneath them. One thing was kind of gross: one of the wait staff stood in the corner, scratched her scalp, picked her nose, and then went on to set out the plates, bowls and silverware for the tables.  :-/  Never saw her wash her hands.",

Very confusing and we probably paid $20+ more every time until we noticed the last 2 times we went.  The price for the dim sum plates are pretty expensive as well. My family is used to paying close to half the price in SoCal.  We've gone here multiple times, but felt the bill was more expensive than what we're used to pay for dim sum.   Also, it feels like an old food court inside.  That being said, if you're craving for dim sum and in the neighborhood, you'll get tasty dim sum here!",

Though maybe others like it but I find it too big because there is at least 1/2 cup of oily egg yolk ooozing out of it. Not a very healthy bun. Maybe smaller size better.

I was skeptical that the food quality might suffer for the sake of convenience vs coming at night where food is made to order, but at 11:45, everything was hot and delicious.  The dumplings were NOT sticking to the tins as I was fearing, and my sesame balls with mung bean were crisp on the outside, not too oily, and nice and gooey and chewy on the inside.  Regular Dim Sum items are reduced to $2.98/ea Tues-Fri, so that was a pleasant surprise!  Great experience all around once again!",

There was one nice guy working who helped us to get what we wanted food wise from what they did have available as the carts had only 2-3 items at a time and the same stuff kept passing. Food is better at dim sum cafe or orchid garden. Probably Will not return.",

    "text": "There was 5 of us, 3 adults and 2 kids. Wanted to give this place a try, and it was a regret.  Price: We ordered just about the normal amount we do for dim sum at any other dim sum restaurant. But our bill came out DOUBLE what we usually would pay, averaging $4.25 per item. That is expensive!  Taste: As mentioned earlier, we ordered the items we normally do from other places. Steam Pork Ribs () was tough and lack flavor. Fried Taro Dumpling ()didn't have flavor and was extremely greasy. Curry Fish ball () was frozen fish ball in curry paste soup, not chewy like it should be. Beef Stew () was flavorless as well. Ovetall, it was a great disappointment.  Atmosphere: The restaurant was a bit dim, but acceptable. Unfortunately, there is very little ventilation, the front door was kept open, no A/C which means summer will be horrible inside there. Lastly, many flies inside, a few kept going around our food.  Husband said, this will be out first and last time here.  Price for value was bad, price for quality was also bad.",

    "text": "This is the best Dim Sum we've had in the entire Las Vegas valley. We are from Orange County and have finally found a place to our liking. The food is flavorful, the staff is very attentive, and the restaurant is very clean.  The steamed items are served on the carts. The other items, such as shrimp balls, chow mein,  sweet buns, etc, are ordered from the kitchen. So, everything comes out fresh and hot. The strategy is to put in the order for those first, and then get the items from the cart. You have to try the egg tarts--tart shell is flaky and custard is nice and light. They are close to the strip, by the New Orleans hotel, and you don't have to deal with the crazy traffic in the Spring Mountain area. I wish you all happy stomachs.",

I can't always go when most dim sum is offered at restaurants and sometimes, I only crave it for dinner, so my family and I are so glad that we found Yum Cha.   The location is easily accessible (short drive from Henderson or the strip) and the restaurant is very clean. They have TVs all around showing food shows and the news but the sound is off so it's not distracting. The food shows are pretty interesting (showing different food from Asia).  The staff has been really friendly each time and very attentive.  During the day (lunch) their dim sum is available via push carts (steamed items) while other items are made fresh to order. At dinner time, everything is fresh to order! They also have a full Chinese menu for the non-dim sum fans. Once again, this is perfect for my picky family.  Our favorite dim sum items are: Siu mai (pork and shrimp) Pork ribs in black bean sauce Potstickers Pork buns Beef tripe  We have also tried their sweet and sour pork and fried rice from their regular menu and both were really good and better than other we have eaten elsewhere.  They also have noodle soups and duck on the menu.  I definitely recommend Yum Cha to anyone who loves dim sum (especially for dinner) and for anyone looking for Chinese food. It's worth the drive.",

Few times in my life have I not finished a dish and their har gow was one. The skin was not chewy with a nice bite. It was thick and almost stale. I enjoyed their taro dumplings but it was filled grease (grease residue means it was not sat out to let it seep through before serving).

However, I think it's a little pricier than other dim sum places I've been to. One thing to note that I never get full with dim sum, it's just really a snack for me. Of course, chicken feet can't make a dent in your belly. It probably costs you more energy to work with all the bones. The main reason is that I get tired of chewing a lot, so I stop ordering more food. So if you are expecting to get full, you should order something with high carb.   Service is okay, or maybe we were a big group of 20, so the waitress was very confused. The restaurant itself is clean, looks like new. It doesn't really have smell of food all over the place. This is really good for an Asian brunch. I would want to come back.",

I ordered some general tso's chicken,  shrimp dumplings,  and pork dumplings to go. I wasn't expecting it to cost a lot but it was around 18 dollars!   It was 18 bucks but I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of food you get. I got the normal 4 pieces each of the dim sum,  but the general tao's chicken was a large helping!  I think I had it for dinner in two or three nights. It was all delicious!",

We ordered so many different dishes. The food quality was excellent. The flavor was great as well. But if they served dim sum from opening to close, it's a great possibility the restaurant would be pack with customers. The restaurant is still new and very clean. The ladies room was very clean as well.  The server explained to us that only a few of them can speak English, the rest spoke Chinese (Cantonese). So we sat in her station. She was very nice and attentive even though we were a group of eight. Next time we'll definitely be there during lunch hours for dim-sum.",

By the end of dinner, it was a busier house. Employees were very kind and frequently checked on us. We came for the dim sum and it was our first visit there. We got many items from the dim sum menu... I believe a solid 8 items at the very least and had 2 items from the entree menu. I was glad they had a full menu of items outside of dim sums. I believe the price points were between $3.90 (sumtin) and $6 (sumtin) for the dim sums. The items were as fresh as you can get and it was helpful that you could view half of the kitchen area from the seating area. Overall, one of the better places to get dim sum in comparison to the other places in town.",

This is definitely one of the better places. Service was good and while most dishes were frozen, they were well steamed and had the correct sauces. The ones that were fresh made in house were great as well. Out of the 11 dishes we got, here are my three favorite and three least favorites.   Three favorites:  1) Beef tendon - Fresh and tender. Sauce was on point  2) Lotus Leaf Wrap: Savory & tasty. Good rice to meet ratio  3) Tea: We got chrysanthemum. Ask for rock sugar.   Three least favorite:  1) Shrimp dumpling: A little cold - nothing special. Tasted like the frozen ones you can get at an Asian super market.  2) Roti Canai: Bread not flakey, curry was average.  3) Fried Taro Buns: To fried. Taro inside was good but not a lot of filling.   Overall, while there were things I didn't as much, everything tasted good or great. Definitely come here if your craving some authentic dim sum.",

    "text": "Yum cha? Yum-my! Yum cha means dim-sum in Chinese fyi.  Ever since this building was BJ's buffet, I never wanted to come near it again. But for Father's Day, my brother and I decided to go with Chinese food and suspected all the other places to be packed. Yum cha was not busy at all during lunch time on a holiday... which was cool with me 'cause the dim sum carts came rolling in real quick.  We had a bunch of different dishes- steamed pork ribs, two different shu Mai, bean curd, tofu, various dumplings, & rice paper rolls. Not bad, although I'd skip the pork next time. All of these dim sum options are $2.99. Not expensive either, compared to other dim sums near the area (I'm looking at you, Chang's!!).  Spacious and open dining area. You can walk right up to the open food bar. The owner walked me through it an pointed out each item and suggested the curry roti, which is picture-popular on Yelp. I regret not trying it now. I did try the fried shrimp balls (kinda too oily) and pork ears, which was the most flavorful dish we had. This one was seran-wrapped behind the glass display, and I think they just microwaved it before bringing it out. Wish it were fresher! They did charge for tea which I found surprising, as most Asian restaurants do not, but it wasn't much. Also about $2 for a tiny bowl of rice. My father liked it so much that he brought visiting family to try it a few days later, who all enjoyed it too.",

Superb service and the food taste like home... Location is great as well only a very short drive from the strip. We came around lunch hour and the food stays fresh on the carts. They also have a hot plate bar where they pan sear taro cakes as ordered so it was very fresh. My parents are elderly and they find the seasoning just right. Just the fact that we could communicate with the servers and owner/manager is simply like home. We are coming back for dinner service to get a better idea! Bring an empty tummy!  We went for dinner and it was amazing as well! The salt and chili pepper fried shrimp is perfect! And the  slow cooked pork belly is definitely well seasoned! The food here is not greasy or too heavy on salt so you won't need a nap afterwards! Two things are very impressive here if you're Cantonese: the steamed egg was exactly done right, smooth in texture and not tough,BB; the other was stir fried beef and rice noodles , ,!  traditional Chinese cooking!",

Everything was mushy and had an off flavor.  -pork spare ribs had mushy texture and a foul smell. -shrimp noodle sauce was totally off in flavor. -shumai was also mushy and tasted horrible.  -pork balls were super greasy and had a strange mushy filling.  -salt and pepper squid had a thick coating that seemed like it was packaged frozen food that they fried up and sprinkled lots of msg on. -Chinese broccoli- this was the only thing that was edible and seemed to be made fresh.   There was so much food leftover because we couldn't stomach eating anymore. I seriously think they steam and fry up frozen packaged dim sum. I've had dim sum at many places good and bad but I must say this was by far the worst.",

    "text": "We were out and about exploring Vegas when we had a sudden craving for Dim Sum.  So I tell my son to Yelp the nearest one, and this place popped up. It's located in a strip mall at Decatur and Tropicana, next to a Walgreens. There is plenty of parking and you can't miss it from the street.   We went inside, it was around 1530 (that's 3:30 pm) LOL. The space was huge, with plenty of seating, but because of the time, there was hardly anyone there eating. We were greeted by a friendly face and seated right away. It's not your ordinary dim sum place as food items are ordered off of the menu. Our eyes got kinda greedy and we ordered a bunch of stuff from the get go.  It was kind of a wait, maybe because they make it as you order.   Everything was good, but I probably will not order the Chicken Shumai and Beef Short Ribs next time. The shumai was kinda rubbery and the beef ribs DID NOT look like the picture. I was actually dreading it.  My advice is if you are contemplating ordering more, I suggest you order half way through your first order. All in all the experience was good.  Very friendly wait staff.",

What caught me was that they offered dim sum all day long. It's a big restaurant. What differs them from others place is everything is ordered off the menu. It helps with pictures as well. Versus the ladies walking from table to tables with their carts. There's also the counter where you could actually see the dishes before hand and know what your ordering.  We went for a selections of dishes. Classic shu mai, dumpling, pork bun, congee, spare ribs, to the infamous chicken feet. Not my choice as I don't eat them. Portions is ok, some order smaller than others. Some dishes were great, shu mai, pork bun. Others were ok. Overall, service was great and the staff was very helpful with ordering.  Heads up, they add tip your bill before hand. Tip was added to our bill of four people. Then there's a selection below giving options to adding the percentage of tips as well. So if you don't catch it, you'll double tip. We mentioned it to the lady and she told us it's the credit card machine layout. Who knows, just heads up.",

The crispy pork belly was not worth the money. It was upgraded to a larger size because the server told us the regular serving was very small so with the upgrade it was about $17 and still the plate itself was small :/  overall our bill came out to $205 including the tip for a group of 9.

The staff here is always attentive, which makes for a fast dining experience, and the dim sum is served all day, so you have the pleasure of enjoying fresh made dim sum either breakfast, lunch or dinner.  When you first walk into the restaurant, it's definitely a lot larger inside than it looks from the outside. They have a little over a dozen tables, so you do get seated right away, which is always a plus especially if you're a bit hangry.  When you sit down, the waitress immediately takes your drink order and return promptly to take your order.  I am a dim sum creature of habit, so I usually order the same dim sum: pork and shrimp siu mai, chive cakes, shrimp dumplings, chicken feet, roti and curry, Xiao bao (soup dumplings) and shrimp rice roll! It is always made to order and it is delicious.   The price is great too! I can eat to ultimate fullness and only spend about $12-$14. They also have a Chinese food menu, but I have not had the chance to try it yet as I never make it pass the dim sum.  I highly recommend this place! Til next time Yum Cha!",

The ambience is atypical of most dim sum restaurants in that there's a stainless steel display/warmer counter that greets you as you walk into the dining area (you can see it in some of the photos).  So, nonconventional, right?  BUT, I was VERY pleased and happy with the variety and quality of dim sum available...  For all the dim sum I've eaten throughout my life - and you're talking Hundreds, if not thousands - I've yet to be disappointed.  I LOVE dim sum and Yum Cha Certainly does not disappoint.    The only knock is the price point.  Although it's cheaper than some of the  places here in Honolulu, I just wish it could be a wee bit less expensive because I friggin woof these things down like popcorn.  This time around, I filled up on the har gow, spinach har gow, ha cheung fun, taro wuh tao gou, turnip lo bahk gou and my absolute fav, fuhng jaau or \"phoenix claws\" (what we used to call it as kids), a.k.a. chicken feet.  Growing up, Baachan would tell us the cartilage contained collagen and protein which was good for our skin and complexion.  There maybe some truth to that...  In any event, you won't be disappointed with Yum Cha... I guarantee it!..",

    "text": "Of all the different types of Chinese cuisine, dim sum is among one of the most well-known, though its origins are highly disputed. Some believe that a past emperor of China, frustrated at his inability to try all of the delicious food his chefs created, convinced his chefs to create many small dishes he could try without getting too full too quickly. Others believe that dim sum came about through a general in the Eastern Jin dynasty who would send buns and snacks to his front-line soldiers as a way of expressing his gratitude. The most likely origin is associated with teahouses along the Silk Road that hosted weary travelers and served tea and snacks; this practice of serving tea, \"yum cha\", is where this restaurant derives its name from.  As you might expect, Yum Cha prides itself on serving all manner of delicious Chinese dishes, though it's most well-known for dim sum. I came in on the 4th of July, when most places would be closed -- craving dim sum, I eventually made my way here after having to leave Chinatown and its crowded restaurants.  I was not disappointed -- Yum Cha has some of the best dim sum in town, and even better than some of the dim sum at my usual haunts in Chinatown! The staff were very friendly and attentive, regularly asking how I was doing and refilling my water even before I asked! Needless to say, this helped them get high marks in my book.  As for the food, I ordered a lot of items just so I could try a little bit of everything, like that Chinese emperor of old, and I was not disappointed. Everything was flavorful and delicious, and very distinct in how they tasted! Standouts included the spicy pig's ear salad -- which was very addicting and my first proper foray into pig's ears; the xiao long bao soup dumplings, which were warm and melted in my mouth; the shrimp and pork shumai, which I use to judge a dim sum place and were juicy and flavorful; and the baked lava custard buns, which were sweet, savory, and ridiculously messy to eat in a good way! All of the photos I have attached show the full range of menu items that I ate.  After my meal, I was quite satisfied and happy -- one of the meaning of \"dim sum\" translates to \"touch one's heart\", and indeed, I was quite impressed and pleased with how delicious everything was, cementing Yum Cha as my go-to destination for dim sum here in town. Of course, there's only so much I can convey in this review how amazing this place is -- why not find out for yourself? Yum Cha is a good place to introduce yourself to dim sum, and who knows?

Here's my quick rundown:  Shumai - very standard. Tripe - tender in slightly seasoned broth.  very standard Yum Choy - chopped greens were cooked well and loaded with stalk and leaves.  Very good. Pork ribs - cooked with chopped pumpkin.  Greasy & blah.  Not good. Beef ribs - loaded with black pepper and also greasy but good flavor. Tofu skin with pork mixture -  chewy and very tasteful sauce.  It was very good.  Sesame balls - crunchy, chewy, and sweet bean filling was perfect.  Very good!  The service was quick and it only took about half hour to finish our meal. Very affordable.",

The staff is friendly & attentive, some of the staff didn't speak English but we were able to point to the menu to get our orders in.

    "text": "I've been wanting to have dim sum in Vegas, but it seemed there wasn't a unanimous favorite on Yelp. Yum Cha seemed to be the best of the options so my mom and I tried it out on a Saturday night. When you walk in, it resembles a cafeteria. We were seated right away and ordered water and hot tea (no alcohol here). There weren't any carts operating, we just ordered from a server.   They have a dim sum menu and \"regular\" Chinese food menu, though we only ordered the dim sum. We ordered the Mushroom Mai, Xiaolongbao, Lotus Leaf Pork Sticky Rice, Veggie and Potato Curry Puff, and the Beef Rice Noodle. They were out of the Beef Rice Noodle so we ordered the Chive Dumpling instead. The server sort of laughed at us after we ordered, and maintained a somewhat sarcastic tone the whole time, but I think... he was trying to be funny? I have no idea. I thought he was trying to imply we ordered a lot of food but at the end of the meal I didn't think it was too excessive.   All of the dishes we got were huge, even if there were only 2-3 pieces per. These are definitely not bite sized. The Mushroom Mai felt like a meatball/fishball and I think it's important to note that even if a dish is called \"mushroom mai\" or \"chive dumpling\", these are not vegetable dishes. We realized at the end of our meal that 3/5 of the dishes we ordered were made with pork and shrimp and the sticky rice also had pork. I wish we would have been able to switch it up a bit and we should have ordered a few vegetarian dishes. The curry puff was one of my favorites, and I really liked the texture of the sticky rice. The skin of the xiaolongbao was really good and I'm disappointed I didn't get to try the rice noodles. Overall I think our selections were a little too similar. Even with that mistake I didn't think the flavors were that great overall. It's hard to distinguish much flavor when you have a pressed ball of pork and shrimp that falls out of your dumpling. I think I'll be trying some other dim sum places before trying Yum Cha again, if I ever do. I will say that the meal was crazy cheap. $23 bill for a good amount of food for two people.",

We were greeted by the hostess immediately when we entered and seated immediately for our group of 11 with no problem. We were given menus, water and tea all around. Looking around the establishment is clean and well maintained. There are TV's all around displaying different channels and a large TV displaying Asian seafood show all on mute so it wouldn't be disruptive.  Food:  We ordered ALOT of food. Our server was great. She remembered everything we ordered except for 1 dish without writing anything down... at all and we ordered a minimum of 20 dishes.. impressive.   My party and I ordered the typical dishes you get at most Dim Sum spots (see pictures/video) Everything was pretty much delicious and really had no complaints about any thing except for the jellyfish (usually my favorite). The Jellyfish was prepared very differently than i'm used to with it being a dry style compared to it being served with a sesame oil type base. I can probably speak for the rest of my party that most of the dishes were pretty good since we didn't leave much left over (jellyfish and a little piece of taro).   The only dish that didn't come out was the porridge. But, by the time we were done with our meal we didn't even want it because it was so full. As we got the bill and asked if they charged us for the porridge they said no and they didn't.   End food review  The establishment was very clean, the staff were friendly and attentive. Just a nice Dim Sum restaurant near the strip.",

    "text": "I write this because I cannot stand the unethical ways this place conducts its business.  They \"force\" you to write a favorable review on Yelp before they will give you a good discount for the meal.  So I KNOW I cannot rely on the reviews I see on Yelp for this establishment.  My own experience here has been extremely mediocre quality of dim sum, bordering on really questioning how people can give such high praises for their food! However, we do experience a slightly better quality more recently, but I still believe in second, third and fourth chances, unfortunately, and I still have to avoid going there as much as possible.    The positive things I can say about this place are: 1.  Nice setting, relatively empty, probably for the same reasons I gave above for my own experience. 2.  Nice enough service, for a dim sum joint anyway. 3,  Easy parking and access.  Negatives(which for me are the most important factors: 1,  Quality of food is at most 2 stars, on a very generous day for me. 2.  Prices do not in any way reflect the food provided.  I would much prefer Ping Pang Pong over here even in pricing! 3.  I just can't handle the unethical business practice this place exercises.  I would like to propose that Yelp makes all reviewers an optional check box in their reviews denoting that they may be receiving any financial gains for posting their reviews.  Since the owner/manager sits/stands there while he awaits your posting, you know he will see if you are posting a negative review, and by simply posting most of the review that he's looking at, and then at the end be able to check off that box can give the reviewer the comfort of some redemption of his/her soul while posting his/her \"positive\" review.  Meanwhile, let buyers beware.",

The food was tasty as well and it didn't take long for them to bring their carts around to us or take our orders from the menu . The only thing I didn't really appreciate about this place was how long it took for us to get seated , get checked for more water/napkins and get our check after we were done . I understood that there were tons of people , but we were literally waiting in line to pay instead of them coming to get the check from us . And the workers don't speak English that well , so it'll be hard to understand them sometimes.",

Not only was the food good but the prices were decent and not ridiculous like San Diego dim sum prices. Staff was extremely friendly and attentive. My husband and I felt like we had every staff member there taking care of us lol. There are ladies pushing carts and you can order off a menu as well. The decor is meh but the food, price, and customer service was on point! I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "We love dim sum and thought we would give Yum Cha a try. We go to Vegas about 3 times a year and since my heritage is Chinese/American its a must when we roll into town. Unfortunately the food at Sum Cha didn't quite hold up to our standards. It ended up being on the inconsistent side. How so? There was a disconnect with the servers and the cooks when it came to ordering separately from the Dim Sum carts. One cart server that we ordered from seemed annoyed at having to leave her cart to order the items from the 2nd kitchen and quickly told us it was backed up. The food was super hot and fresh as it came off the carts but when the 2 items from the kitchen bar section arrived, one arrived cold in the middle and the other was delivered well after we were done with our meal and before we asked for the check. Overall we felt that the food from the carts was the best (even though it was average-mediocre) and surmised that the kitchen may be experiencing its own separate issues.  Not sure we will be back to Yum Cha as there are a couple of other Dim Sum places we like to go to like Ping Pang Pong!",

Beef ball - these were ok, I'm not a fan of the seasoning used in these.  Non-Dim Sum: Chive dumplings - delicious, but you better like chives... they really border on too much. Chinese Broccoli - delicious, a bit of a small serving for $6.50. Beef noodle soup - delicious, loved the soup, my roommate thought it was very expensive for Chinese ($11.50)... but there was a good amount of beef and veggies and the broth was delicious and it was big enough to share.",

All the steamed dumplings were succulent and fresh. The sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf was another favorite -- springy and flavorful. We've already been twice in a week and will be returning again the next time we're in the area. Service was outstanding: our water glasses and tea was constantly replenished, and we were asked if we wanted refills even after the check. When we ordered off the menu, our dishes appeared so quickly it felt like magic. Lovely atmosphere, cozy and casual. A must-visit if you love dim sum.",

We never ran out of water or tea and they kept our table clear of empty dishes.   The restaurant is very clean which is always a plus! There are too many places that have great food but dirty dining areas. Yum Cha has amazing food and very clean. There's a lot of seating and they can accommodate larger parties.  Now for the food, this is hands down best dim sum I've had here in Las Vegas! Some of our favorites were the pork and shrimp shumai, shrimp dumpling, sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, ang roti canai. Their yum cha fried rice was also very good and flavorful.  We had the custard buns for dessert and those were simply amazing. A definite must for those with a sweet tooth!   Visit this place, you will not regret it! We will be back!",

I could have had 3 portions of the eggplant if everything else wasn't so good. I try the sesame red bean balls wherever I go and they were the best I've had in a while. Will definitely be going there again.   The reason I gave it a 4, which I could give it a 4.5, is the soup dumplings were not as good as other places I've had in this city.

I suggest arriving after 11:30 am to give the kitchen enough time to heat things up.  The restaurant is clean and the service is good.  The pork and shrimp shui mai didn't taste like L.A.'s, but it was passable.  I think the best item I had was the baked cha shu bao.  It was stuffed full of delicious cha shu in a perfect sauce, and the bread was baked to a sticky sweet golden brown.  It's worth another trip, but I'm not going in too early next time.",

This is a sit down style dim sum although the rolling carts are only until 2:30PM unlike two others in town but exactly like 1 place on the westside that is full day non cart rollout.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful with the menu items and even some of the unadvertised off menu items such as Chinese broccoli and black tea.  The menu is American broccoli.  The prices are about average although different costs for week and weekend meals.    This works for families and even individuals looking for a good place to eat where you can bring a large group or a quiet intimate date with a loved one.",

We got takeout here one night on our trip, and while it came out pretty fast, people working there were somewhat snippy with my husband who went to go pick up the food. Whatever, it's a busy week with the holidays so can't imagine people working there are thrilled to be doing this, but besides this point, I thought the food wasn't all that impressive for $10 a bowl of noodles. We got the curry fish ball soup with flat rice noodles (good, but $10 is a little bit overkill for about 6 fish balls and pretty much just red curry soup), and wonton noodle soup (again, about $10 for around 5-6 dumplings with a pretty basic broth and some bok choy). In a part of town where you can get decent quality ramen for less than $10, this was kind of overkill. We also got the century egg / pork congee which was around $5 but pretty small for the price. Overall, a bit of a ripoff but it got the job done.",

The baked lava custard buns and steamed lava custard buns were awesome! Trust me, you should give it a try even though they looked super big. Across the states, I believe their custard buns were above 95 percentile. Don't be scared by the huge size of the baked lava buns, and don't lose interest in the boring appearance of the steamed buns, they were really really amazing!  The shrimps dumplings across all kinds were okay, I guess you can just pick the ones based on the stuffings that you like.  The rice noodles were super disappointing. At least the ones that we tried on that day were not fresh, the stuffing, either shrimp or beef, were super small. It was one of the few that I could confidently say that I don't like at all, even though I'm a rice noodle person. It seems that even if you finish your meal for 30 minutes, they won't even rush you for the check if it's off peak hours. However, we were kinda busy and could wait anymore and went to the bar for our bill...",

I came at 5pm on a weekday, so maybe this is why? I felt that everything I ordered was not fresh. The dimsum was regular tasting (I ordered shrimp dumplings, pork and shrimp siomai, mushroom Mai). I also ordered the beef and tendon brisket which was very very bland. I was already feeling kind of grossed out but when my steamed pork buns came, that's when I decided I was officially disgusted. The pork buns looked like it was very very old and steamed to death. It was so soggy and mushy that I could not even take it out of the basket. The pork inside looked like baby food. It reminded me of bread dipped in hot water.   Sorry, I'm going back to Orchids. Yum cha did not hv sticky tables like Orchids but at least I won't feel that I ate old food.",

Yum Cha is advertised as an all day dim sum; however, this place did not fully live up to that. Many of the items were not available upon request and we were, instead, forcefully advised to try alternatives. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing bad about giving suggestions, just don't be pushy and annoying about it.   There are definitely better dim sum options in town in comparison. We tried this place out because friends suggested it. They raved about the quality and price. We, on the other hand, did not have the same quality experience they had.

The manager said its because they are still getting their supplies in.  The fried egg noodle dish didn't look too promising, but turn out to be quite delicious.  The turnip cake was a disappointment.  Hardly any turnip, therefore no turnip flavor.  The shu mai was very good, though it was made with ground pork, not chopped pork.  The har gow skin was outstanding.  Thin, good chew, very good.  Unfortunately, the shrimp inside was not the freshest, with a strong fishy taste. Pan cake for the roti canai was light and crispy, and the chicken curry sauce was spot on.  We were dipping everything in the sauce.  The curry fish balls and the curry spare ribs were just ok.  I would skip the stuffed bitter melon next time.  Only thing I taste was the bitterness of the melon, not the stuffing.  The pan fried noodle with beef and tomato was very good.  Now to the best part, all that food and only $35.",

Yum Cha is great because even though they put away the carts during mid day you are able to go to the counter and order what you want. I also get wonderful customer service here! They are all so friendly and helpful giving suggestions about all the options to choose from. It is also cheaper Monday through Fridays, which is a plus. I will be coming back again for the great service.",

The food (dim sum and Chinese) is absolutely wonderful and the service is amazing with friendly waitstaff and the staff is awesome when helping you decide what you would like. We were visiting Las Vegas from Arizona (but transplants from the Bay Area in CA) and my family and I were missing the dim sum places that seemed abundant in the Bay; Yum Cha filled that void! Having just recently opened Yum Cha is ready to take over Vegas. I highly recommend stopping by to dig in on some Bao, pearl noodle, or order yourself some Shu Mai... A must visit when in Vegas!",

    "text": "We booked a hotel near by and was on the way to Pahrump when we noticed Yum Cha. We decided to stop by and have breakfast there after we check out of our hotel. The morning before heading out we parked exactly at opening time and it seems that there was quite a few families already seated so perhaps they open earlier than their sign (states 10:30 am), also was very pleased that they were open at all considering it was NYE, but hey it IS Vegas and we all know Vegas is the city that never sleeps. We were seated quickly, the dim sum carts came pretty quickly and the food was decently priced. A little more costly than I am used to, but we come from San Diego. The food tasted good, but there were 3 reasons why I decided to rate this establishment 3 stars. I would like to point out their servers are exceptional at how quickly they sweep away the empty plates and used napkins. We did wait on one dish for quite some time, with no one ever checking in and our table asking 2 or 3 times, we felt like we were forgotten. We stayed an additional 10 minutes or so after we had already finished our meal despite putting the order in early to midway through our meal. When we did get the egg tarts, it didn't seem like it was cooked thoroughly and tasted mushy (something even my 8 year old son noted) we are far from being snobs, but it was just very noticeable. When we were ready to pay our bill we walked to the register and waited there for at least another 10 minutes. When you're just standing there awkwardly and literally the only people there, 10 minutes is very long time, lol. It's not that they didn't see us or know we were ready, they just took care of the other tables instead. There were two people at the front desk handling the payments but halfway acknowledged us with our card and bill in hand and kinda just ignored us and made a small gesture to continue waiting while they took care of people that were still eating at their tables. It didn't make sense because we waited for our server to collect our card, but after awhile we decided to just go to the front. Only for the two people in front to be getting all the receipts out for people who were STILL eating and having us wait for an additional 10+ minutes. Doesn't it make more sense to take a quick pause to let us pay and then continue, as we are in front of you waiting and the other guests are still eating? Again, good food. Decent prices, Open parking lot, good servers. But they should have better service when it comes to following up and paying the bill.",

We only come here for dimsum and it's great that they serve it all day.  This time we came with our son and we ordered a lot.  We're surprised that Elaine still remembered us and she and her team always give excellent service.  Food are delicious, service excellent, and the place is very clean compared to other Chinese restaurant. Our favorites are roti, shrimp ball, taro dumpling, BBQ Pork Puff Pastry, so we always have these whenever we come over.  This is now our GO TO DIM SUM place.",

My wife and I visited this place yesterday and ordered   1. Hai Gow -- ( shrimp dumpling ). Only bits and pieces of shrimp with a lot of pork grease. The dumpling skin is sticky. Chef needs to work on improving the skin.  2. Shrimp Cheung Fan --  ( Shrimp rolled in large fat noodle ).  Shrimp is very small. The Cheung Fan is too thick. Has no taste.   3. Chicken Feet -- For the one, the chef has to re-learn how to flavor the dish. Tasteless!!  4. Rice in lotus leaf -- again, totally tasteless. In the rice, there is only minced pork and a piece of Chinese sausage. The chef needs to visit other dim sum places and re-learn his trade.  5. Tofu with fish meat -- again, tasteless.  We stopped ordering when 5 out of 5 are failures.   Awful place if you are interested in good food.",

Of course it took forever...they were over-run! Every local was trying to eat there because it's so good.  We had brunch there yesterday and it was amazing!! We hadn't even settled into our booth and were already had several piping hot delectable items in front of us off the cart! Shrimp dumplings, spicy beef, tender tendon, chicken dumplings, fried shrimp/crab claws, curried fish balls, hot mustard and chili oil!! A bounty of Dim Sum Delights!! Plus they offer a wide variety of a la carte items like beef stew and noodles. The service was friendly, quick and intense! Our waitress gave us the low-down on the house specialties and made good recommendations. We ate until we could barely stand up to leave! The place is huge and can accommodate large groups. The prices are good. I plan to visit every time I am in Vegas. It's only a short Uber off the strip and totally worth it. Yum Cha is my new Vegas Fav for Dim Sum!!",

    "text": "I really wanted to be blown away by this place. But I found it to be average for a dim sum spot in Vegas. Vegas has some of the best food from all around the world but for some reason no one in Vegas can get dim sum right. I was raised in LA eating some really good dim sum so when I moved to Vegas a few years back I made it my personal mission to find good dim sum. I moved back to LA after a year so sadly I never succeeded in that mission but I kept an eye on the Vegas dim sum scene. That's why when this place started popping up in my Instagram feed from some of my Vegas Instagram foodie friends I got excited. I cross checked yelp, finding out that it had a 4 and a half star rating so I knew I had to check it out next time I was in town. This next time happened to be on Christmas Day. It was both cool and not cool that it was open but it's a Chinese restaurant. Chinese restaurants never close.   Now don't get me wrong. It's not horrible. No place I've tried in Vegas is really super bad. Every one is just ....ok. This place didn't really set the bar any higher. Maybe I'm just a little dim sum spoiled I don't know. I just don't find that it lives up to the standard I'm used to.  We had quite a few dishes I'm not going to name them all but I'll talk about a few. The pork and shrimp siu Mai was cool. Its probably one of the tastier dishes. The shrimp rice noodle fell a little flat for me. I mean literally the rice noodle was thinner than usual. But then again that's my favorite dim sum dish so maybe I expect more. And the shrimp. I don't know why but every dim sum restaurant in Vegas uses small shrimp. Maybe more cost effective but I prefer the larger more succulent shrimp used in restaurants back home.   The service was lacking as well which hurt my rating. They said I had just missed the rush so some of the things I ordered were not ready so it would take a little longer. So it took us a lot longer to finish than usual. And one of the dishes almost never came. After all the food had come out and we finished eating i asked about it. They said they were still making it. Give it 5 more minutes. After 10 minutes I asked again and one guy said they were still defrosting it. That kind of turned me off. Like I know it might not be made on the spot. Maybe it has to be heated up but frozen and then defrosted and then reheated just didn't sound too appetizing to me. So after another 5 minutes which in total is almost an hour after we initially ordered I asked to cancel it. They said yah it's still not ready we can cancel it. The server went to go cancel it and get the check but then someone else brought it out before the check came back. So we just took it to go. That was I would guess the worst dish of the day.   Like I said this place is ok. I think I just had my hopes set a lot higher. So I guess ..... the mission continues.",

A bit disappointed in the beginning as we waited a while to get service for a restaurant that is not busy. I believe he was the manager that had to tell the cart lady to come to our table. There's two carts of dim sum that goes around, but without a system. The 2nd cart barely made it to our table, we had to wave to her.  There's also a counter that has food displayed and you can also order from there. I hope they would tell you the process as you would guess what's it for, we had to ask.   Food in general was not bad, but I had better. I like the ambience and it's clean. In the end service was good.",

I normally go to Chang's when I get my dim sum jones but wanted to give this one a try when I saw it from across the street at the International Market.  Good selection and I like that you can order additional items from the provided menus.  Outstanding char siu bao - perfectly sweet and savory.  Only complaint - and it is VERY minor - they could have had one additional cart of goods moving around during lunch time.  When I went yesterday, they only had two.    In the end, what really matters is the taste and quality of the food and this place is has both!",

One of my favorite items was the egg tarts. The crust is so fluffy and the custard in the middle was superb and creamy. The place looks very clean and not old and beat up.

Prices aren't bad either. $2 and some change per servings during the week, and $3 and some change on weekends and holidays. Not bad.  However, service is kind of all over the place.  Everyone is nice for the most part. They have the ladies walking around with the dim sum carts and if they have what you want, you're golden. However, if you want to order something that's not on the carts and you speak English only, there is a communication barrier more than half the time. One lady just nodded as said she'd get my order and 20 minutes later, never came back or acknowledge me and my family. I had to ask another women who understood and watched her walk straight behind the counter, grab the item I asked for, and come straight back with it! I'm guessing the other woman didn't understand me at all or forgot about us.   Anyway, I've only been here twice so far. The first time we had a gentlemen coming to check on us regularly who spoke English and it was great! For that, 4 stars.  The second visit was with my family visiting us from California and I was so sad they had to be there to witness the lack of customer service. For that, 1 star.  I definitely will be back for the dim sum, so hopefully I can have a better updated review then.",

Its a 15 minute drive from the the strip but it opens after 10:30 so dont both going early morning. The service is friendly and prompt. The food is above average Chinese dim sum. At least better than the one we have in New York City. price is $4 to $6 per dish but well worth it for the quality. Highly recommended if you crave for dim sum. It opens late!",

The staff was friendly which is always nice. To be fair I showed up there on a Thursday at 2:30pm which means this may have had some bearing on what was on offer. It was okay. I was going to snap a photo of what I ordered but it just didn't taste as bad as it looked. So that didn't seem fair. I ordered shrimp with black ,  spare ribs, shu mai and shrimp with chive.  Nothing was bad but the shu mai was old like it had been sitting for a while.  Listen this spot is clearly a favorite with the locals. It's large, clean and there's a great market across the street. Here's the take away. Visit Yum Cha on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I truly believe that their rush hours are different. I'm curious enough to visit on my next trip. So far K & J is the best in Vegas by my experience. I ate there at 3 on a Monday and it was fantastic!",

The food here is made to order and there's also dim sum carts around so you can start eating while waiting for the rest of your order.  Must: Curry noodles with egg noodle (you can pick your noodle type), dim sum (radish cake), roti canai, Choy sum, their new item fried pumpkin.  I highly recommend this spot. Definitely worth checking out.  I had my fair share of frequenting Chinese restaurants, and if you have as well, you'd know they are not known for good customer service. It's all about good food. This place has both. Gem!!",

They bring carts around the table for you to pick the small plates you want and if you don't see what you want after a few carts go by, the wait staff is helpful in getting you your particular choices.  The owner of the restaurant was noted at the time I was dining and helped out as much as he could given that the restaurant was very busy. We had a wait to get a table, but it wasn't more than 5-10 minutes when I arrived around 12 noon on a Sunday.  I had the traditional shrimp dumplings, pork shui mai, turnip cake, shrimp with rice noodle wrap and all were very good. I will definitely come back to Yum Cha the next time I am in Vegas.",

It doesn't have the large dining rooms that I have been accustomed to in California, but there isn't much of a wait here either. Like traditional dim sum spots, you can order some larger plates off the menu while you peruse the selection from the carts being pushed around.  There are a few dim sum dishes that I thought were decent enough to come back for and others that I would avoid. I enjoyed the siu mai and the glutinous rice dumplings (filled with pork). The shrimp noodle rolls were also really good. However, the shrimp dumplings and soup dumplings were poorly made and quickly fell apart. In fact, xiao long baos were so dry that there was no soup inside. Of the large plates, we tried the beef chow fun, which was well received.   The prices are decent and the service was pretty fast after we were seated. Prices are about 50 cents cheaper if you go on a weekday versus the weekend.",

    "text": "Uhhh overrated. That is all. For $3.58, you get such a small portion whereas if you go to another place you get more on your plate. Maybe I'm a spoiled Bay Area girl where dim sum is readily available and delicious that this place is nothing compared to it.   First off, the place isn't very inviting. It seems like a cafeteria in a way. Very big space, but it just feels cold. I mean it's cool they have this bird cage design going on when you look up, but other than that nothing.   I only ordered dim sum dishes so I can't say anything about entree dishes. But it's cool they warm up the dishes for you when you order dim sum plates so the food is hot when it comes out. The sad thing is the portions are so small! Three small pieces of shrimp dumpling (har gow), shu mai, etc., you would have to order multiple plates to feel full! Nothing spectacular about the traditional dim sum plates either. Like I said mediocre at best. Har gow is har gow. You just get the taste in your mouth, but it prob won't hit your dim sum crave. The baked bbq pork bun came out with two decent sized buns. The gloss was too sticky and their was so little filling vs bun. Sad.   Winner of this whole experience is the lava custard pineapple bun. This is the closest thing I have found! It's a bigger puff almost muffin looking, but the runny oozy custard is totally on point. Probably the only reason I would go back to this place is just for this dish.   Overall disappointed. Three stars because the food is okay, the service was good, price a little too high. But I'll be back just for those custard lava buns. If anyone knows where else to try, let me know!",

Upon entering, I was surprised at the amount of asians that were there since its kinda located in the outskirts of the strip and not even in Chinatown area.  Based on the amount of people there, I was thinking that it must be good... Sadly, I was fooled because the hargow was kinda soggy and the same with the xiu mai. Maybe I'm just a little picky because I'm from California.. But this was not legit dim sum in my opinion. I also had a few other Steam dishes but none that were memorable.  We also ordered a few of their fried dishes like the shrimp egg rolls and 2 orders of the shrimp balls. It's nice because they seem to make it fresh to order, but when I received my shrimp ball, I noticed that the paste inside was undercooked. When I pointed it out to one of the servers, they immediately took it back .. Which was nice until they tried to charge us for 2 orders when they only gave us 1. I do appreciate that the waiter was nice enough to remove 1 of the orders when I pointed it out, but I can tell he was annoyed.   Anyways.. the food here is decent enough if you're really hungry but not up to my standards to what dim sum should taste like.",

I haven't been up for dim sum lately, since my shellfish allergy makes all the good stuff hard to enjoy. I had read about Yum Cha on Yelp though and was eager to check it out. My husband was an immediate fan of their curry items and I really enjoyed their BBQ pork buns (extra sticky and meaty!). Our servers took care of us and explained their process to us  - during lunch/busier times they do the carts, but dinner and no so busy times you can order off the menu. Everyone was very helpful and eager to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. There has been a lot of turnover in this area, so I hope to see Yum Cha succeed in 2017. Seriously, get the custard buns!",

They had the usuals which were all delicious and I have to say their rice porridge and beef noodle soup were SO good and didn't need additional seasoning, which is rare for me when it comes to rice porridge. We will definitely come back next time we're in town. So good and affordable!",

We had the following dishes:   ha gow - the filling was bland but the worst part was the wrapper. The wrapper was mushy and very sticky   shrimp cheung fun - the cheung fun was a bit thick and tough, nothing like the ones I've had back in San Francisco and LA areas   noh mai gai - rice was undercooked, bland as bland can be. This is usually my favorite dish so I've eaten it a lot   feng zhao - it was cooked alright (maybe a little too soft) but very bland   fried pork belly - over fried so it was dry, stale seasoning   tea - not very good. it was hot enough but even after steeping there wasn't much flavor at all even at the end of the meal  The service wasn't bad with lots of servers for a half full restaurant. They were quick, attentive, and friendly. As a sidenote, they really should get toilets/urinals that self flush. I took a look, washed my hands, and left the restroom without using it.",

Whatever did arrive was part cold .and not so good, the shrimp look funn was disintegrating as we picked it up with our chopsticks , no texture or bounce at all. The only saving grace of our meal with their laksa that was good. Everything else, was cold, and lacking in flavor and texture . Service was almost non existent in the sense that everything took forever. The price was pretty cheap tho but I guess u get what u paid for. For a party of four our bill was only $60. We still never got our damn shu Mai by the way which we asked for 3 times from the time we sat down to 10min before to deciding to give up and go.",

For dim sum, you need to know Chinese to get fast orders since people in the restaurant don't speak much English. The atmosphere in the restaurant looks like a flea market with customers running around to get their orders.   Foods are not great either. I got a bad smelling food from dim sum. Not sure it was my bad luck or they reuse the food from previous days.   Anyway, it was a total disappointing based on Yelp reviews. You get my idea",

I heard about this place from a co worker of mine and she says she likes it and its fairly cheap. Im  Chinese so i was not impressed. The food was decent but not good and when we tried to order some dishes they said they were out. For a place that says open til 1030 with all day dimsum they sure were out of alot of items . All in all i dont recommend this place and much rather go back to changs or orchad garden for my dimsum ! My family and i will most definitely not be returning !",

With her rehearsal schedule we couldn't make it to any dim sum places during the normal service hours....and Yim Cha serves dim sum ALL DAY. Order from a menu and it's made right then and there. It's close enough to LV Blvd to be an easy choice for anyone staying to play. It's far enough away to make it ideal for those wanting to avoid the crowds.   Onto the dim sum. We are only two, so our ordering was limited. The baked baos are HUGE, as in one could almost be a meal huge. And they were fresh and hot as was everything. Siu mai are so packed with flavor we took two orders to go for breakfast! Har gao was perfectly steamed and full of shrimp. The wrapper was properly chewy and tender. Chive dumplings are huge and so tasty and came out piping hot and crispy on the sides from the pan fry. Our craving has been sated until we return.   The menu has me wanting to try so many more things. This is perfect for bigger groups as you can order a wide variety and try it all. Service is attentive and very friendly. You'll leave with a smile, a happy tummy, and wanting to return.  Editing to add he prices are very good here! A lot of good food for little cash!",

We also didn't have any sauces at our table so we had to grab them off of another empty table.  A server came to take our drink orders and we ordered half hot tea and half iced water. She only brought out the tea.   The cart servers weren't any better - they totally ignored us even when we stood up or raised our arms to get their attention. If it was busy, it's understandable for them to not notice us, but it was definitely not busy.   Once we did get our dishes, legit everything was overcooked. The shrimp dumplings stuck to the paper on the bottom because they were so mushy and fell apart when we tried to pick them up. The shrimp rice roll was too mushy it just fell apart in my mouth, I didn't even have to chew it. And the bun baos were so mushy, when I picked it up, the top felt like mud and it stuck onto my finger.  Not coming back, do not go here.",

    "text": "Funny, I coulda sworn I did a review of Yum Cha when we tried them out 2-3 years ago. Like the fact that it's kind of in a \"random\" location in a strip mall, NOT on/near Spring Mountain/Chinatown. We went in around late lunch time so it was nice and quiet - maybe 4 other parties in a quite spacious restaurant. Don't remember the specifics but I'm sure I got my \"usual,\" i.e., shrimp rice noodle, the glutinous rice wrapped in lotus leaf, har gow, shumai, and I believe they were fine. Not awesome, not bad. Like a solid B. The one thing that does stick out is that their pork & chives dumplings (hockey puck sized, perfectly fried crispy on the outside thin dough skin containing a filling of the perfect ratio of chives/spices to pork) are OUTSTANDING. I believe it was Yum Cha that started me on a pork & chives dumpling kick - ordered them from 4-5 different other places and nope, Yum Cha's rocks. Husband also very much enjoyed their chicken chow fun.   We haven't had the chance to go back, as the location is kind of off-the-beaten-path for us, but looking forward to the next visit, as this, and Ping Pang Pong, are the only 2 decent dim sum places in Vegas (IMHO) where they nail most (but not all) of their dishes. We've also tried Hong Kong Garden and Dim Sum Cafe in Summerlin, where some of their stuff was OK, other stuff was.. mehhhhh. Still on the hunt for the perfect dim sum place comparable to the \"big hitters\" in San Gabriel Valley.",

    "text": "Yeaaahhhh....noooope. While I'm sure Vegas may have far better dim sum options... This one certainly isn't it.  The pros are simple... They were very friendly and seemed attentive. (This would later prove entirely inaccurate). There were literally only two other tables (of 3, and 2 pp) in the entire cafeteria sized space when I arrived(3 more 2pp parties came later after my first plates did) Apparently the cart option for traditional service had ended at 2pm.... So the only dim sum ordering process was via menu.  I ordered the shrimp and pork chive dumpling, fried shrimp wonton, Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, and veggie egg noodle. When asked what I wanted to drink, I asked for hot tea. Remember how I mentioned the place was sparsely populated...? Right? So, youd think Id hv no issue actually getting my food and service after sitting down. Well, you'd be wrong. I did get all of my order relatively quickly except for one dumpling, but I never got a single refill or offer for any additional fluids, never got a single plate cleared even though multiple servers walked by, saw my empty plates, only to bypass mine and p/up from other tables. My broccoli was the standout...but, I mean who can mess up steamed broccoli? LOL. My egg noodle was far from fresh and congealed in a hunk, it was clear that had been sitting for a while. I still thought it could be salvaged, so I asked him to reheat it. They zapped it in the microwave, I thought that wld fix it, but it was evident, since it wasn't already fresh to begin with, this was a vain effort. My shrimp wontons were okay, they were fried a little softer than I like, but not bad. The pan-seared shrimp and pork dumpling didn't come for a full 17 minutes after the rest of my food. Mind you, everything was ordered at the same time. I literally saw them making 3 pan-seared orders for OTHER tables who came in after me, all of whom were Asian... But every instance of my asking about my own order, was constantly met with, it's coming it's coming. Well it took a long-ass while to come... And then by the time it got there, at least it was hot, but it was as blandly gentrified Chinese as everything else. I don't expect some of the basic things I ordered to have too much punch in favor, but I at least expect stuff to not taste like it was pre-packaged, pre-made, possibly frozen, and merely thawed and then reheated. Nothing seemed fresh aside from my broccoli. While  the pan-seared dump was made fresh, I kno bcuz I watched her, when she finally made them... everything was just BLAAAAND. For the price, I definitely expected better than prepackaged, reheated dim sum. But I'm pretty sure this is exactly what I had. I feel after tax was 24 bucks. Not crazy expensive, but not as cheap as I typically find Dim Sum that is far better, elsewhere in the country.  Plus, for the record, it'd be awesome, as a non-asian individual, to go to an Asian establishment, and recieve the same attentiveness as their Asian patrons.... Not just secondary or tertiary, if and when they happen to have excess time to cater to you after catering to them first. Smdh. I have yet to find a place that actually adheres to this. So I guess it's too much to hope for. But still a fat greedy girl can dream. LOL  I was disappointed... and my search for good dim sum in Vegas continues. Hopefully I'll find something before I head back home to the East Coast.",

Also taste liked old, frozen, and dry. It has the same texture as dried shrimps that have been rehydrated.  It was awful.   Soup dumpling - very cleaply made. The meat once again taste cheap and very crumbly. The meat didn't bind together. I took one bite and I was done. Couldn't force myself to finish the rest.   Shrimp egg roll- once again the shrimp is very dry and  old tasting. Couldn't finish that either. (Yall see a trend here right, dont get anything with shrimp.)  Chicken feet- was over cooked. Yes the meat fell off the bone but the bone also fell apart too. So you'll get little tiny shard of bones when eating it.   Shumai - the only thing that was okay.",

    "text": "Although quite easy to see when passing by on the street, this restaurant didn't have an exterior that pulled my interest or make me remember to try it.  It might be the name or the lack of advertising on the outside.  Over time, possibly 2-3 years after seeing the restaurant, we decided to give it a try.  Thankfully through Yelp, I was able to see photos of the food and get a feel for the overall restaurant.  I didn't know that it was a dim sum restaurant but also serves dim sum all throughout the day.  The inside is quite spacious with high ceilings (and a number of bird cages hanging throughout).  I wouldn't consider myself a dim sum snob because it doesn't take much for me to enjoy dim sum.  It's not a weekly thing but when I do have dim sum I tend to enjoy the experience.  At the times that I would go to YumCha, they don't have the many people pushing the carts around offering the various dim sum choices.  They might do that earlier in the morning.  The food that I have tried is great and they have a very expansive offering from traditional choices like shao long bao to more fast food style choices like general tso chicken.  I really enjoyed the chow mein here, I thought it tasted great.  I recommend the hot tea which you can share and they keep refilling it with more.  If you ever crave dim sum later than midday than I would definitely go here.",

Don't get me wrong, I would love to crush chicken feet wherever I go but I could tell at 11 am on a Friday that it was leftovers from the previous day.  As for the pork shumai, I normally like my things well seasoned and on the salty side but the shumai had an off day. It was a little over season to the point in which it ruined the flavor of the dish.   Lastly, I wasn't feeling the the sticky rice. The leaves used for it steeped into the sticky rice to the point in which the dish tasted bitter. I couldn't get over the taste and called it quits after that bite.",

    "text": "Went to Yum Cha for dinner on a Saturday as a party of 5; our party ordered off of the dim sum and regular entree menu. Everything we ordered off of the dim sum menu was really good! I'm a sucker for the BBQ pork bao and look forward to going again just for that! We all tried chicken feet for the first time and it had good flavor, although the process isn't for me. I didn't enjoy the bones/tendons, personally. Other people in our group ordered chow mein and beef with broccoli and said it was good.   Only negative is that service wasn't great. They took a long time to come to our table and take our order and since we weren't sure how much food we would want to eat, we asked to waitress to come back after we started the first round of dim sum but they didn't come back until everyone else in our party was done with their entrees... Also, the food didn't come out together; the timing worked out that we received our dim sum choices before the entrees came out (problematic for children who are understandably impatient when hungry) and then we weren't able to get more dim sum until well after their entrees came out.  I want to go back for lunch service to see if the service itself is better when they're busier and have the roaming carts; I'm not sure if it was an off night or if it's always slow. I've heard before that non-Asian diners can receive less attention, but that seems like a racist stereotype based off of singular experiences without going back to see if service is different or better at another day/time. For all we know they were short staffed, so I'd like to give them another chance!  The food was good and they kept our drinks refilled, so it's worth another shot! I'll update my review after our next visit- dim sum is definitely at least 4 stars.",

I don't know what the circumstances were that those that gave less than 4 stars were, beyond what they wrote but I've lived in Vegas since 12/01 and I've found my favorite place to get pizza and sushi but, until today, I've been desperately looking for my go to Dim Sum spot. You know that spot you're proud to take visiting friends and family? Well Yum Cha is that go to Dim Sum place.   You walk in and it's spacious. Plenty of room to not have people to in your bubble while dining but not so spaced out to look like they need more tables; a perfect balance.   As soon as we sat down, hell, as soon as we approached our table, a cart was standing by to serve us. You're all, \"A CART?!?! No! The food will be old and cold!\" But alas I say, you can order what you like from a server and have it made and served piping hot fresh. Like take a minute before you take a bite or you will burn your mouth, \"hot and fresh\".    Here's what we ordered, all freshly made a la cart, but not the Dim Sum cart...  Shrimp Dumplings  Steamed BBQ pork buns Shrimp rice noodles  Shrimp stuffed eggplant  Chinese Broccoli  Xiao Long Bao - soup dumplings  Shrimp & Pork Chive Dumplings  Shiitake Sticky Rice Mai Salt & Pepper Calimari Egg Tart    Pot of Hot Tea and two very good iced teas $66 with tax and 18% gratuity.   The staff was super friendly and helpful and open to our requests for freshly made platters, more napkins, fresh plates and more hot sauce.   Located street side just south of Tropicana and Decatur on the west side of Decatur.   My search is over. Yum Cha is my destination spot for the best Dim Sum in Vegas.   Support you local small local businesses, especially when they are this good.   Well done Yum Cha!",

    "text": "DIM SUM 12/7  Yu-go and I have been dining here for nearly three years and have basically tried nearly all of their vast selection of both traditional and vegetarian dim sum and many of their entrees especially during dinner. I'm particularly partial to their Malaysian dishes where the wonderfully gregarious and most hospitable Sam and Elaine are orginally from.  Of course weekends are much busier serving dim sum from their push carts. Lots of large tables to accommodate larger groups. The spacious restaurant allows for comfortable seating and conversations to remain relatively private. Table service is always with a smile and with very frequent visits. English, Mandarin, Cantonese and Bahasa are spoken here.  The many bamboo bird cages suspended from the ceiling and the numerous flat screens showing food preperations and travel in South East Asia definitely lends to an enhanced appetite.  There is a tendency to order ones favorite dim sum dish from the cart.  Nothing wrong with that. But, look through their pictured dim sum menu for vegetarian dishes. They are astonishly tasty and good for you.  Consistency of excellence and friendly service is what Sam's and Elaine's Yum Cha is all about. Did I mention that dim sum is avaliable all day and every day of the week. No more having to get up early on your dayoff to beat the crowds for fresh made dim sum.",

The usual, check out is at 11, my friends and I are all dead from going out and being belligerent and at this time there are only two things that sounds good  1. My bed 2. Comfort foods ...so the search for dim sum pre-holiday weekend traffic on the drive back home begins. Yum Cha came up and I b-lined it to the restaurant, about a mile behind the Palms.  We were greeted with a smile, sat right away, and were served har gow before I could even let them know I wanted water. AMAZING! I was so excited, it was two of my friends first time having True dim sum and they were so taken back by how fast the service was. I love love love the authenticity of this place. And *everyone* was so sweet. Service was impeccable, and we kept letting them know. I think servers should always be praised when they're going above and beyond and let me tell you, I probably could've asked for Mcdonalds and they would have brought it to me in a steamer haha! Even one of the servers mentioned that he loved the management, I appreciate that so much! Food service is hard as it is, it's good to know employees are happy where they are.   But seriously, some of the best dim sum I've had in a long looooong time. I grew up in the Bay Area, so I'm used to real china town goods. This place completely brought me back. Please go here, pleaaaaaaaaaase.  I wish I took pictures of my food but I was so busy stuffing my face I wasn't even thinking of anything else. 5 stars alll around!",

First off, the food was great and there was a pretty vast menu of various items to choose from. They serve dim sum all day which is quite unique, and the food was great! I always tend to get hot tea when doing dim sum, and usually it tastes either very watered down or just like straight up hot water, and was also not expecting how good their tea was either!  My friends and I were seated promptly and were never neglected throughout the entire service, which was quite impressive as we had a fairly big party. Overall very satisfied and would definitely come back, the staff was so friendly and helpful!",

When I walked in this place I saw that it had a large dining room and a partial open kitchen with a display of their desserts and some of their menu items including their Peking duck. Their ceilings were adorned with copper looking bird cages  they also had interesting signs as soon as you walk in the door and even at the restroom area to even inside the restroom. Their menu had a variety of dim sum to Chinese food. So we ordered Pan Fried Chive/Shrimp Dumpling, Mushroom Shumai, Shrimp Shumai, Salt & Pepper Fried Crispy Shrimp, Veggie Egg Noodle, Sugar Cane Shrimp, Fried Shrimp Wonton, and Steam Pork Ribs w/Taro| For dessert: Soft Grated Coconut Mochi| Golden Sand Lava Custard Bun| Coconut Bun.  You order your dim sum from their menu and they serve it ALL DAY. They don't have servers they go around in carts.  Oh so Yummy! Everything from food to service was 5 ! Every dim sum restaurant I've been to before the service is never that great. The wait staff here is so attentive and very friendly and always there if you need anything. A must go to place again",

I have never had such excellent service in a Chinese restaurant in my life!!!  The staff was very helpful with our orders, patient, and attentive to our needs.    Dim sum for 2.  Got shumai, 2 kinds of chive dumplings, har gow x2, fishcake stuffed tofu x2, crab claws, and sesame bun.  I would say the food here is good.  Not great, not bad, but definitely good.  Would I come here again?  Yes I would.  Would I recommend this place?  Yes I would.  The reviews I read lead me to believe that there were tons of items up front in the display.  I was a little let down that they didn't have all the items I was hoping for.  The carts that come around are pretty standard for any dim sum restaurant in town.  The shumai were  good, they were my favorite item.  I judge every dim sum place by their shumai and I was not disappointed.  I'd like to go back with more people so I can try more items.",

It's not any better than Orchid Garden. My favorite place remains the one in Gold Coast....favorite among the ones available in LV. None of them are that great. If they have good food then the service sucks. If they have good service then the food sucks. I am not sure why one of the popular ones from LA have not opened shop here.  We ordered quite a bit of the usual stuff and the price came out to be less than $30 for 2. I am perplexed by why they make you go to the counter for regular items like chive dumplings and egg custard tarts. Those are regular fare. The items on the heated trays should be for take outs or maybe specialized items but no one wants to get out of their seat to get some items while some are wheeled around in the cart. It's seems counter intuitive to me. They do come by with trays selling fried items that normally are not good sellers though.  I think management needs to rearrange the way they set things up. Manager was nice and pointed things out to us but I will probably not be back. There's really nothing to make me want to come back. I wish them luck though. I am not the type to yelpitute myself for a free item. I am annoyed I fell into the trap and went because I thought all those stars meant a good one opened up. Too good to be True.",

When it comes to the Roti and Curry get your own. We thought we could share one and it almost destroyed our relationship.   There are so many things that immediately set Yum Cha apart from all the other restaurants in this category. Most noticeably is the walk up counter. Not only can you choose from cart options, but you can also choose from other options at the display. Another major difference for me is the friendly service. Everyone is smiling. Not a common thing I see at most restaurants in this genre. Come experience Yum Cha for yourself. I know I will be returning real soon.",

The employees working and pushing the cart stok in Chinese to us when we ask questions that was really difficult for for us to communicate. There is a lot of picture pointing going on. However once you finally do get past that barrier the food is very delicious however a little bit slow. The prices for the food are reasonable and it fills you up pretty quickly.",

Take the 10 minute drive from the strip to come here.  It's worth it!!!!",

    "text": "\"I think I have an abusive relationship with Dim Sum.\" These were my boyfriends words after we experienced the superb service at Yum Cha.   We were instantly greeted with smiles and an explanation of  how everything worked. They even had a selection of hot teas we could choose from: oolong, jasmine, and another one I didn't quite catch the name of.   Normally service is terrible but here, it's different. During our dining experience three different people asked if we needed anything, kept our waters filled, and no attitude was given.   The setup of this dim sum establishment was a lot different than anything I've seen either. Carts still came around with the steamed goodies but their fried items were set up along a cafeteria window. They displayed the items along the window and then they bring it over to your table.  Overall, the quality of food was good. Not the best but good. I think as soon as they start picking up customers and pump out fresh dim sum the quality will get better. Otherwise, I'd come back because the staff is attentive and friendly, there's no 20 minute wait, and it satisfied my dim sum craving.",

The Yelp reviews seemed great and the website too, so we figured, \"let's check it out!\".  We arrived and the place had an inviting vibe with many tables and a great looking dim sum menu. I love the carts full of delicious food, the different choices and flavors. A few carts came by with more and more great choices! We started with shrimp rice dumplings, chicken and pork shu mai, tons of sweet pork dishes. All so good!!! The tea was also excellent, went so well with our meal.   The service was pleasant and the manager was so friendly! He treated us to a delicious pork bun and took us through a tour of the food that is in the buffet-style area. I am excited to go back to Vegas and try that Malaysian dish!! My boyfriend loved the place too, it's a great spot, I totally recommend!",

We were seated immediately (boyfriend, son, and I) and they all seem like genuine people. Compared to most dim sum places, the service was great and the food was prepared fresh. You can actually watch then prepare your food for you. Freshly steamed, freshly cooked, and in a timely fashion. I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try. It's ALL DAY DIM SUM at such a reasonable price and extremely tasty! I'll definitely be coming back whenever I crave for more dim sum!",

Best customer service but a lot of their baked goods like BBQ pork bun, coconut bun, baked egg yolk bun at the counter were old and just kind of reheated and a little dried out/ chewy. They ran out of steamed egg yolk buns and no longer have that egg yolk cake pictured in yelp, and didn't make several dishes that they normally would like white fungus they have on their slide show and other items I asked for. All of the steamed items from cart were gold and unappetizing, the cheung fun was ice cold and noodles hard. This is probably one of my worst dim sum experiences but I am from San Francisco....This meal was all a waste of calories and we should have stopped ordering instead of having hope. Sorry but 1 bad experience prob won't bring me back here despite the really nice helpful people that work here.",

The staff were friendly and the owner was very sweet. He came to check on us several times and we had a great conversation with him. The food was amazing! They have some people with carts walking around the restaurant, and the rest was made right in front of you where a row of steamers and staff were. It came out quickly, was flavorful, and fairly priced. If you're looking for a good dim sum spot in Vegas, this is the place to go.  I plan to stop here every time we are in Vegas for a great breakfast, vs an overpriced waffle on the strip.",

So I ordered from the counter then the food disappeared for about 10 minutes Hahaha WOW. below average dim sum. Then I had to hunt down the spice tray not on the tables. Install some fans and get rid of the empty bird cages.. Seriously!  Tip of the day - 168 market has better DIM SUM and better service. No return visit.  P.S.

When we were in Vegas a few weeks ago, we found this place on our first day in town, and we're so thankful we did. We went 4 more times throughout the week. If you venture off the strip, which you absolutely should, this place is a gem. The dim sum is fresh and tasty. The staff was super helpful, especially Elaine. Since we went 5 times, we made our way through their entire dim sum menu; our favorites were the Pork & Shrimp Shumai, Shrimp Dumplings, and the Chive Dumplings. The most unexpected and delicious item was the Radish Cake. Elaine told us most Americans really don't like it, but we absolutely loved it. It was super affordable, the prices couldn't be better. Can't wait to go back next year when we're back in town.",

The place is pretty clean as well. And they go to your table once you're seated so you can choose from the dim sum menu. And then when you request one server something, they're very polite and acknowledge you. I've never had this good service in a dim sum place so i was really surprised. I love it. I am definitely coming back to this place with more people!",

Never saw shrimp dumplings nor shumai until I was full with unwanted food.  Asked what I wanted many times for 30 minutes, but noone really cared. They will simply ignore if you are not getting what you want. Becareful where you seat if you are planning to come here.",

Servers come to you with a cart full of various piping hot items like steamed pork, buns, beef tendons, chicken feet, dim sum, fish balls, and more. What I listed is what me and my wife got lol. Plus the fish ball noodles soup, roasted duck, and sweet red bean buns for dessert.   I thought the price was insanely cheap too. I thought the cashier employee ready 87 bucks, which sounded right, but it was actually just 47$!   Speaking of employees by the way, the servers were all very nice, offered suggestions, and were nice enough to give us half a duck when we asked as opposed to the whole thing which I think they usually serve.   STOP BY AND YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED :D",

    "text": "Came to yum cha cuz of all the good reviews.. 4.5/5 stars on yelp on a dim sum place?! Gotta try it!! Yum cha is located on Decatur x Tropicana, it is right across from international market.  The menu for dim sum is really small compare to all of the other dim sum places, and they have it by groups. It doesn't have a lot of what I usually ordered, and on the day that we were there, they don't even have the BBQ pastries bun, they told us they don't have it today. So I've tried the har gao, siu mai, spare ribs,  the sticky rice with lotus leaves along with a few other dim sum, and honestly, I am not impressed. The taste is alright, I've definitely had better elsewhere, but the lack of dishes is really upsetting, I still felt the crave for dim sum after eating here. And they don't have egg tarts! (Maybe it's cuz it's weekday?)  On their menu, they have a bunch of random stuffs too, like roti with curry and etc, and u can also go up to the counter to get the food too. While they do have good services, I come to dim sum place for dim sum, so expand your menu!! Seriously, there was a lot of dishes that you can add!!  Oh another disappointment was that they have messed up on the har gao. It was over cooked and the wrap wasn't made right. And I wanted to try their xiao long bao and they didn't have it :(  However, they do have chicken bao here and it's rarely seen in most dim sum place. And they are also supposed to have streamed cake but I didn't see it in the cart?  The price is cheaper on weekdays/non-holidays so it's a better deal to go on Monday-Friday but they might have less items on the cart(?).",

Upon arrival, I was slightly disappointed that the place looks like a food court with a hot food counter, tiled floors, and barren tables and chairs.  However, the food was surprisingly good!  The servers were all helpful and quick.  When we asked for something and they ran out of it, the cart lady jotted it down, and actually brought a new batch over to us several minutes later.  I was impressed that she remembered!  The owner or manager was also friendly.  She's one who rolls up her sleeves and hustles.  She came by a couple of times to check on us, and even asked if we liked the pan fried chive dumplings that we ordered.  We said yes, and she said good, because she fried them a few minutes ago herself.  It's not gourmet dim sum, but everything was authentic and done well.",

    "text": "I came here on a Sunday around 11:30 AM. There was an hour wait. After being seated, nobody came around for approximately 10-15 minutes. I waved down one of the ladies pushing the cart, and she said if I needed somebody to wait on us I must wave my arms and call out loudly. Fine. I did as I was instructed, and alas I got to order my dim sum feast. All the items came out quickly and piping hot. But how did this place with such slow, lousy service with steep prices earn my five stars? The dim sum was incredible! Everything tasted heavenly, and the variety of dishes they offer is unmatched. I have tasted many good attempts of classic dim sum dishes before, and Yum Cha's versions were extremely comparable or even better. A couple of new items I tried were the shiitake dumplings and crispy eggplant. The crispy eggplant's batter was an absolute delight, sweet from honey, and the texture was crunchy (but not hard). My family ordered over ten dim sum dishes, and I can't begin to emphasize the deliciousness. My favorites were the lava custard bun, steam sausage bun and crispy eggplant. Next time, I will try to find an optimal time to visit and avoid the crowd.",

    "text": "This almost seems a bit ridiculous, but I always get nervous about highly-rated Yelp dim sum places because I find that those rated lower tend to be more authentic. Despite my previous experiences, I decided to give this place a try. I honestly wasn't impressed.  I'm Cantonese and have tried dim sum from all different sorts of places. Personally, I find that I can really speak to the culture, authenticity, and taste of what dim sum should be. This place was not it. Yes, the restaurant is clean and the service is good, but it was so Americanized.   The dim sum was expensive. The taste of the dim sum itself was subpar. Some of the foods were old and dry and the flavor itself was lacking compared to other places I've tried. They only had 1 cart being pushed around. The remainder of the foods were by order, but came out cold and unimpressive. Nice people overall, but if you're truly looking for authentic tasting dim sum, I would not opt for this place.",

The restrooms are clean as well.   The food is great and for a good price! We spent about $48 for 3 people (8 or so dim sum dishes + Wonton soup). They have two menus: one for dim sum and one for other dishes (like chow mein or fried rice). Because we were early we were able to get our food fairly quickly and didn't have to wait long. We had dim sum and a wonton soup and after a few dishes we were really full.   It was our first time there and definitely not our last. It's also a nice change to go to a dim sum restaurant and just order rather than wait for the carts to come around and hopefully get the right one.",

Items were reasonably priced, maybe slightly on the high side, but you can't complain when you are getting dim sum at 7 at night. The restaurant was practically empty so we were seated right away.  We got your standard fare, shumai,har gow, char siu bao, custard, etc. the dishes were all good, not great, but definitely better than the dim sum place I once visited in Indianapolis (but that's a whole different story and review).  You order and they bring the dishes to you and the waiter left us a menu in case we wanted to order more.  I'd come here again if I was in Vegas and wanted dim sum at night. It was definitely less than if we had stayed on the strip and went to an Asian fusion restaurant in a casino.",

Was craving some dim sum and they did have the carts stocked and running but there were only two carts and they both had the same stuff. There was only our table and two other tables at the time. The congee we ordered barely had any pork in it. Soup dumplings were more dry than soupy. The pork and shrimp dim sum and other varieties of steamed goodies we had was not the worst but didn't live up to the hype. The chicken feet looked old but my friend still ate it. Would I recommend this place? Only if you're in desperate need but there are so many good places to eat in Vegas I honestly probably won't go back.  The ladies were nice there but please make soup dumplings actual SOUP dumplings!",

Let me start by saying we filled our bellies to the brim and were in and out in about 35 minutes! The dim sum is super fresh and almost too hot to eat (that's a good thing!) but everything we ordered was delicious. We loved that everything is made with such care. The dim sum is super light and delicately made and not too salty!  Everything had a great texture and flavor! Not any flavor over powered anything.  We tried the following and as I said loved it all! My only negative is there was not really any \"spicy sauce\". The chili sauce they had was pretty bland. We ordered the following the chicken shumai, shrimp and spinach steamed dumpling, the shrimp (almost a ravioli) something in a light broth. The sweet chicken wrapped in tofu was yummy! A beef something from the cart and a sticky shiitake mushroom rice. I think I got it all. Just get what strikes you as I said everything really was great! Service was fast, friendly and helpful and they clean while you are sitting there! So two thumbs up and they do take out!! Yippie we will be back!",

    "text": "When in Vegas, you win some, you lose some, and you dim sum!   Our party of 12 walked in at 1PM on a Sunday and got seated right away at a round table with lazy susan in the center. The place was spacious and very ideal with the dim sum carts going around. It only took 5 minutes to get food on our table as most of the stuff we wanted were all in the carts and the ladies pushing them were on top of it. Siu mai, about 10 orders of 4 were what we consumed the most. We also got chicken feet, spare ribs, har gaw, breaded fried shrimp, sticky rice, beef tendon, and those heavenly fried mochi balls stuffed with pork. Special orders were made such as yang chow fried rice, shrimp wrapped in white rice noodle, turnip cake, taro cake, and sweet tofu with ginger of course. Everything I so pleasantly partook in, sans chicken feet as I don't eat that.   You might find yourself lost in translation here so when in doubt, ask for the male server who speaks english or he might have been the manager, not sure. Really patient guy with all of our additional orders and following them up. We had to cancel our 2nd order of the breaded fried shrimp as that took forever to come out. It was so good though - bummer. There was also some confusion with the itemized bill but that same guy cleared it out for us.  Bottomline, would I come back here if craving dim sum in Vegas? Absolutely!",

    "text": "I am seriously dumbfounded at how this place scored 4 stars with over 1,000 reviews. Simply dumbfounded.  The place and parking lot were completely empty when we walked in. There was one table.  PRICE- $$$$. The items on their ABCD list are almost double the price of other dim sum restaurants. The chicken feet (odd color, see photo) were $4.50! A small 4 piece shumai runs up to $3.75. There is no shrimp in the shumai.   TASTE- mediocre. The items are basic. The food isn't nasty or anything but it is incredibly basic. The flavors are there. When I saw the price I thought the food would be fantastic, but was disappointed.   PORTION- SMALL. Very small! My party ordered the beef tendon when I went to the restroom and when I came back I thought it was half eaten. It was untouched.   SERVICE- decent.   OVERALL- This place caters to tourists. The servers ask if you are from out of town and then have nothing to say when you say you are from here. Do not come here.",

Out of comfort?  Curiosity?  Wanting to compare against home Dim Sum?  Looking for something unique?  Want to escape the strip?  Yep, all of the above.  Yum Cha, no relation to the Singapore \"Yum Cha\", is located in a strip mall on the outskirts of Las Vegas Chinatown.  Plenty of parking in the lot and plenty of tables in this large restaurant.  The four of us walked in before noon on a Friday and we were quickly seated.  Quick thoughts - Not crowded, no rush, not much ambiance, multiple TVs showing Chinese and American food shows, bird cages hung from the ceiling to simulate pet bird markets in Asia, long, open, kitchen along one side of the building opposite the windows, tables spread out, a little run down...  English, Cantonese, and Mandarin spoken here, thus there won't be any problems ordering.  We ordered: - Braised Chicken Feet (good) - Beef Noodle Roll (good, rolls were tight) - Sui Mai (ok) - Chive and Shrimp Dumpling (ok) - Mushroom Dumpling (good, although skin broke) - Salt and Pepper Squid (very good) - Fried Egg Plant with Lemon Sauce (pass on this veggie lemon chicken unless you want overly battered egg plant with a sweet lemon sauce) - Runny Egg Yolk Lava Bun (really, really runny - it will gush out if you don't suck some of the egg yolk out first) - Green Tea Mochi with a Coconut Filling (Coconut was too moist with not enough texture and taste, prefer drier)  Service was good and if you look around, wait staff will come over and ask if you need something.  Not your typical look away and ignore you Chinese restaurant.  Interesting restroom signs...check it out.  Overall - decent Dim Sum but as an out of towner, I'll likely try another place before coming back....Liked the Runny Egg Yolk Lava Bun and Salt and Pepper Squid.  Pass on the Lemony Fried Egg Plant.",

This is not the best dim sum, but it is definitely average.  Since they do serve dim sum all day, don't expect a bunch of carts going around.  You are able to order anything you'd like to have and they will bring it out from the kitchen.  The dish that stood out most to me was the chicken feet.  I especially enjoyed the flavor of the seasoning and the dish was cooked perfectly.  It was tender and delicious.  Service was great and if we're in the area wanting to eat dim sum, we will come back.",

The prices were right and the reviews top notch.    Yum Cha did not disappoint.  We order our standards - shu mai, sticky rice, soup dumplings, tripe, chicken feet and baked pork buns.  Everything was excellent!  No really - excellent! The food was hot, flavorful and plentiful.   The food always seems to look alike in every dim sum place.  Yet it's the preparation and cooking that separates the True artists from the imposters.  Yum Cha is in a strip mall but once you are inside it's a combination of old world Chinese restaurant with a modern open kitchen.   You put yourself on the line when you open the kimono and cook in front of people.     The space was clean, airy and had high ceilings with bamboo bird cages hanging above.   Prices were very competitive.  We had 6 dishes, tea and soda for $33, with a $5 tip included.  I wish we lived closer to Las Vegas just for this place.  Try it.  It may not have old people like me pushing carts around the floor but the food is the star -  they serve it fast and fresh!",

Stuffed shrimp atop a slice of bell pepper was okay. Fried pork belly had a thin crispy crunch on the outside and not overly seasoned. Steamed custard was super yummy. Best eaten warm.

We came on a Thursday morning, and they had barely anything in their carts and when we asked for specific items they said they put in a order for it.  We were there for 30-40 minutes eating a chatting, the food was okay, the skin on the shrimp ha gao was thicker than i'm used to.  I would probably go again just so I can see how they are on the weekend, and maybe a fresher selection of dim sum.",

We went at almost 11am and got sat right away. The only thing the servers were slow to take our order. I have to wave down someone twice but one of the guys who helped us in the orange shirt was really nice. Defiantly recommend and will come again next time I'm in town !",

Service is great with all servers and the owner himself being really attentive to all customers. The food is AMAZING and very flavorful. If the item you're looking for isn't in any of the carts, they order it readily for you with no ifs, ands, or buts.   Best of all...THEY SERVE DIM SUM ALL DAY. They stop bringing carts around at a certain time, but you can order all dim sum items straight from the kitchen which ensures the freshness.  10/10 would recommend this place! Go check it out :)",

    "text": "Was excited to check out a new Dim Sum place since the Yelp reviews were the highest for this place in all of LV, and there wasn't even a 4 star rating for one in the past two yrs. Believe me I pay attention since my favorite place is at best 3-3.5.   Well let's just say I don't think they deserve the 4 star rating.   Let's start with the positives. Newer dining room. Fast friendly service. Reasonable selection of items.   Negatives:  Cleanliness - asked for a knife to cut my pork buns and it was dirty  Food - most food was rather flavorless including shrimp dumplings, shu mai, shrimp chow fun, shrimp mushroom dumplings, lotus leaf pork steamed rice, and fried shrimp roll. Salt and pepper calamari, Chinese broccoli, and baked barbecue pork bun were ok. The steamed beef meatballs were not good.   Not all of the dim sum items were not pushed on the carts and some had to be ordered off the menu so the dim sum experience was not the best.",

The shrimp rice noodle was cold and flavorless. Everything else was just ok. Lastly we ordered curry fish ball, and the inside is freaking frozen!!! I told the lady that the inside was frozen and she just walked away....told a second server that the center of the fish ball is still frozen and he prob didn't understand so he called another server and this time we finally have a response. There was no apology what so ever, he just said:\"oh..I'll cancel your order\" and that was it -_-   The only thing that's keeping me from giving this place a one star was the fast service. And also, the tea tasted like charcoal at the end, it was weird (we ordered the oolong) Will no come back again",

We're from Oklahoma and every time we visit family in Vegas, we come here and order AT LEAST 10 orders/plates of the ha cheung fun (shrimp noodle rolls) and 2 beef cheung fun with EXTRA SAUCE. Everything is great, but the cheung fun is our absolute favorites! The owner is also great, she remembers us when we come! Definitely one of the best places for dim sum, available all day long.",

Cheaper then most dim sum, so I guess u get what u pay for!  It's a good thing I only bought around 7 items to go and tried it out at .    Every item I ordered was a BIG disappointment (lack In Flavor, taste and texture)  I'm so sick of trying out new dim sum restaurants cuz I always end up going back to my one and only place(Ping Pang Pong)",

You can only order dim sum at the counter and they heat it up for you.   The dim sum was only okay. The ha gow felt old and was already sticking to the bottom of the tin. The tripe looked so old that it was even white. The only one that tasted really good was the shumai and that one was the last to come out and it was piping hot!   We also ordered crispy pork belly, fried calamari, and salted fish fried rice.   The crispy pork belly was not pork belly. It was just pork dipped into batter and then deep fried. Not good at all. The fried calamari was good! The salted fish was good but def not worth $13 for basic fried rice.   Service was slow on our water since you already know American Chinese food is salty AF. Other than that, they were nice!",

You will feel so comfortable eating here without the yapping in the background that you normally get at any popular dim sum spot. The cute dim sum ladies push the dim sum carts around rather frequently. They usually push the same popular dishes around so if you're looking to taste other items, you should place an order. The ladies wear protective mouth visors to prevent spitting on your food, so two thumbs up for that! If you look up to the ceiling as you dine there are empty bird cages as decor--this really reminded me of the grandpas in Chinatown that play Chinese chess back in the day. Speaking Chinese here is a plus! Clean bathrooms! Attentive servers! Definitely coming back!",

We walked in and the place was empty with one party of 6 almost done. The man counting receipts welcomed us in, so we took a chance. A little odd because we were going to be the only ones there, but we were hungry. Drink orders of hot tea and water were taken right away. However, I had to ask at one point and so did the hubs, and total time took 15 mins. Not a good start. The nice lady mgr took our chopsticks since 3 out of 4 of us don't use them and replaced them with forks - she was nice. The place stated \"dim sum all day\" but doesn't mean carts, so you order from the menu and then wait staff brings your food in spurts. I don't like this idea, but could be different earlier in the day. A few more small parties came in, but our food was okay. We have had 10 times better food than here, but we are always cordial and to try places. We will not be comimg here again unfortunately. Maybe our own fault to come later in the night, but we still had an hour and a half before they closed. Idk...",

    "text": "Taking over the space of the short-lived Fortune Seafood Restaurant, Yum Cha is a welcome addition to the dim sum/yum cha options we have here in Vegas.  Yum Cha is about six months old and notably, quite clean. Other diners appreciated the better customer service and lack of pushiness here.  Although we did experience a little pushiness, but after my firm no, the dim sum lady kept on moving.  They have your standard dim sum pushed in carts along with a hot foods counter with made-to-order items.  Those who appreciate extra crispy freshly made radish or taro cakes will understand why this is important.  (Back in the day and at a few random dim sum places outside of Vegas, they still pan-fry the radish and taro cakes table-side, which means it comes out hot and fresh!)  Because Yum Cha offers this hot foods counter, it will come out piping hot!  You can go along the counter and let them know what you want or ask the server to bring it to you too.  We also received an order of Chives Dumplings freshly off the pan this way.  On our last two visits, we got:  * Shrimp and Pork Shumai * Shrimp Dumpling * Beef Ball * Chives Dumpling (Shrimp & Pork) - It comes out so hot from the pan, so watch it! * Steamed Pork Ribs * Chicken Feet * Spinach & Shrimp Dumpling * Beef Tripe * Beef Rice Roll * Beef Spare Ribs - We normally get the Steamed Pork Ribs but when the dim sum lady suggested this one, it was a big win!  The Little Guy loved it a lot! * Radish Cake - Request it extra crispy! * Beef Tendon - The dim sum ladies have this one in their cart versus the Beef Entrails, Tripe & Radish dish needs to be ordered from the counter. * Beef Entrails, Tripe & Radish * Sweet Rice Cake - I rarely see this dish in Vegas, especially at a dim sum restaurant.  The owner came around on both visits to check up on us multiple times.  He makes sure you are aware of the additional foods at the hot counter.  There are a few service issues that could use some improvement.  For example, I turned the lid on my teapot indicating it needed to be refilled. Unfortunately, no one came to refill it until I asked a server directly.  When I mentioned this to someone in upper management, they told me their star server was out that day.  On our second visit, I think this star server was working because I never had to ask for my teapot to be refilled this time.  However, all employees should recognize when a teapot needs to be refilled.  There are just some servers that are more efficient than others.  There was one server on our first visit who seemed like she hated being there.  It was a pain to ask her for anything since it looked like it was an inconvenience.  On our second visit, there was a discrepancy on our bill as we were charged for an something we didn't order.  Once we brought it to their attention, they looked over it and fixed it.  They did apologize for the mistake and mentioned it was probably a good idea to look over our bill when it's so busy.    I do appreciate that they only charge tea for the Husband and myself.  At other dim sum restaurants, they'll charge tea for the children as well which can add up.  Prices are split into different categories which are marked on your bill as A,B,C, and D.  Dim Sum: Monday through Friday $2.88; Saturday, Sunday and Public Holidays $3.28 Delicious Dim Sum: $3.98 Chef Specialties: $4.98 House Specialties: $5.98  Overall, Yum Cha has become our choice for dim sum in Las Vegas.  I hope they expand their menu to include more elusive items and old favorites as they become more popular.    We also enjoy the ongoing feed of YouTube videos showing food from all over the world on the large screens.  Not only does it make us nostalgic, but I think we eat more as well.",

    "text": "Visited a few days ago after I read review of good food. To my surprise the place was completely empty when we sat down at 1040am in the morning. So we chose a booth, big mistake. A few minutes in, my friend notice something crawling on top of the booth behind me! A small cockroach. That spoiled my appetite completely and gave me yucky feeling. The staff removed the crawling insect with a towel. We moved to another table where we won't have to worry about things we cannot see.  Besides the uninvited free companion, the har gor was good, but the rest of the dim sum  was really so so at best, but pricer than most dim sum places in Vegas with similar or better food. The lotus leaf wrap was not tasty at all and rank near the bottom of the ones we tried (the ones at PPP and Rio's KJ is much tastier). The beef rib was stiff and not tasty, I stopped at one piece.  The staff is ok (even though no one offer me discount after the cockroach was captured, there was no apology), the food I can find similar for less elsewhere in Vegas. Uninvited companion at the booth is simply unacceptable, I still got this creepy feeling of that thing crawling on me since it was only a few inches behind me. Safe to say, I have no intention to ever go back. I would go to Chang's just a few blocks away with similar food but less pricey during weekdays, or go to Hong Kong Garden or Orchid garden. Incidentally, they charge for tea at Yum Cha whereas the other three does not.",

Also service is extremely friendly! Atmosphere is a bit more like a mall food court than a formal restaurant the upside to that is there are big TVs all around the room so you can get them to turn on the game if you're there for lunch on a Saturday or Sunday...  Recommend beef tendon and stuffed tofu skin",

That shows the staff pays attention. Tables were cleaned promptly and frequently offered for more dim sum plates.  On to the food, I'm normally not picky so probably won't get a good opinion on it.  Usual dim sum items were up to par on the taste. I had to order from the menu as some items weren't in the carts. All were not too bad.  There's also some other items at the bar area and boba I believe.  I'd return as the location has plenty of parking and close to my house.",

The food was good, and my favorite was the pineapple bun. The bun was filled with yellow liquid and oozes out when you bite it. The environment was really nice and clean. The servers either spoke Cantonese or mandarin, some knew English. They were also friendly. Besides the dim sum carts that they push around, you can also walk up to the counter to order what you want.  Overall giving four stars because service was slow when it got busier. We ordered some foods but the food never came. Some of the dishes were cold when they arrived to us. I would recommend this place, because it's a nice place for dim sum.",

The beef mixed was mostly tripe, no other organs, and the taste was bland. The HK styple chowmein was a dark sauce, which is not authentic, and tasted so so.

The congee had no taste and I was expecting a lot more from my favorite: har gow. I was also disappointed that I didn't see honey walnut shrimp on the menu. :(  I like that dim sum is served all day and not only in the mornings like most places. Excellent service, but I miss the saltiness and greasiness of the places I'm used to! Lol",

Service, like I said they're not too busy, but we got exceptional service and attention, so I'll give it an A+. I believe the owner himself attended to us and explain how their ordering system work, got everything we wanted in a timely manner. Price, another A+, since we came on a week day, the price is reduced, yes to that! Parking, none issue to us so another A+. I think they do need more honest customer to help them promote, since they are relative new and away from China town, the only way they get exposure is through Yelp.

First, the pros:  clean, spacious and has a very relaxing atmosphere, not to crowded  Then, Cons: took a little while before someone greeted us and took us to our table.  Then the server was confused about our drink order.  One coke and 2 hot teas.  Pretty simple.   We ordered our dim sum which then took nearly 10 minutes to come out.  But not all at the same time.  Pork spare ribs came as we finished eating everything else.    Aside from the chicken feet (My fiance's favorite) everything else tasted old.  The look fun noodles looked grey and the edges were hard, the fried taro tasted like it was made in really old oil, the spare ribs was to chewy and tasted like it was marinating in a bowl of garlic for a week and the hot tea was warm.   Finally, I always find it interesting when we are close to leaving/finishing multiple employees come over to see if we need anything.  A simple and unassuming gesture, but can be perceived as a way to rush you out.",

    "text": "B  I'm from NYC and Dim Sum is one of the staple foods in the city and in the burbs.  I wanted to like this place because family recommended it but let me say this and I am being as honest as Pinochio's nose. 1) the food is not fresh.  It's steamed but not made in house.   2) The place is clean. 3) The food is not fresh.  It's been premade other than the soup. 4) The place is in a dope location. 5) The food is not fresh but edible and if your taste for dim sum is not there yet then this place is \"GOOD\" at best.    I would not come back unless I was being nice to someone.  Even the soup dumpling was \"MEH\" I usually don't want to be mean about my ratings but I have to be honest for you folks out there who wants a real honest opinion.  So visit this place - don't knock any place until you tried it.  UNLESS I GAVE IT A \"BW\" rating.  Food is not fresh Restrooms are CLEAN Tables CLEAN and HUGE Table wait time none.  Restaurant is empty. (1130am) Take out wait time is QUICK Customer service is GREAT - people do not speak English well so you have to really speak like you're talking to a 6yr old.  The manager is nice though.  Ambiance friendly and wide. Kitchen SUPER CLEAN and YOU CAN SEE THE FOOD in a buffet style glass area.  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage).  Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!",

If you are here during peak dim sum / lunch hours they push the carts around. They don't put the carts all day but you can get dim sum anytime and it's all fresh made to order. Be a little patient - it's all made to order and well worth the wait.  They have a huge menu - more than the average dim sum joint. Save some room, try different things. If you're not sure, just ask. Very nice people. They also have a regular entree menu if you're not in the mood for dim sum. I'm tempted to try their noodles but I was told the portions are huge and I'm always in the mood for dim sum.  One thing that really stood out for me was the curry dishes - the fish ball one and the roti one - both were flavorful and delicious. The one with the roti is Malaysian style, made in house. Amazing.",

After waiting for about 45 minutes, I realized that it's a lot harder to get a table for 2 people. It's much easier to get a table for 4. The guy at the counter kept calling parties of 4 or more but skipped most of the party of 2 even if they signed in before. He eventually would call in the parties of 2.  Write your name large and keep checking it as your name may be skipped when things get too busy. My name got skipped twice and I had to point it out to the guy at the counter that he skipped me. He finally got a table in the end.  The service from the staff was rapid. They brought the food out immediately. The quality is great. They have many options to choose from in the cart. They also have a menu if you want to order something different than the dim sum carts.  The price is decent. The cleanliness of the place and the restroom is acceptable.   Keep in mind that I visited the place on X-mas day so it maybe was busier than usual.",

    "text": "I was very stoked to try dim sum in Vegas, but Yum Cha kind of left me unsatisfied. I do come from Los Angeles, where we are infamous for our dim sum in the San Gabriel Valley. So I know to not have my expectations too high.  The main reason I had to give Yum Cha 3 stars (instead of 4 stars) boiled down to the bill, that kinda left me with a bad taste in my mouth (on top of the subpar tea and dim sum).  I went a day before Thanksgiving (Wednesday, November 22), but they had charged at the 'Holiday' rate. It's about 60 cents more per plate. We had initially found this place through my mom's Chinese newspaper, that had advertise $2.85 per dish. When we got there, the regular prices were $2.95 and the Holiday prices were $3.58. The staff confirmed to me that the Holiday price was enforced for the whole week. (I was reviewing Yelp menu prices, because it's been a while since my experience. It appears they were raising the prices every year). If they were upfront with their prices, I think I wouldn't be as annoyed, but that 'shady' business kinda throws me off.  Overall, the service is good. It's casual but the staff is very attentive to your needs. The food and tea isn't good. Like, if you're drunk and hungry, it would be fine, but who would drive that far from the strip to get dim sum --idk, it is open super late.",

I saw the reviews and HAD to stop by to get the Pineapple Buns because they were calling my name. . These babies were so orgasmically good. Once opening the baos the sweet yolk came gushing out.. it was just simply so satisfying.   I walked in and went to the counter and ended up order 5 things..... so unnecessary but SOOOL NECESSARY. We were driving back to Los Angeles and definitely needed snacks... even though we literally just ate at Shane's Artisan Noodles.   Their Pork Buns  2 per order. HUGE Buns... stuffed with pork. Freaking delicious.   The football looking fried crystal dumplings  was good. I wanted more stuffing but still good.   I also got crispy pork pastries. These are savory and just right.   The service was friendly, quick, and efficient. I wish I lived here so I can eat this daily. Bad for my waistline and wallet but so good for my soul",

What really pushed me down to two stars for this place was the veggie dish we got which was suppose to be boiled gailan but it was ridiculously oily to the point where it was barely edible. In addition, their special bun with salted egg was so doughy and raw towards the bottom it just wasn't that great.   Service 4/5  The service here was pretty fast and everyone was very accommodating to what we needed.   Overall we spent around $70 for four people.

A server checked on us and we told them how salty the pork was but she didn't seem to care. Yes, they kept it on the tab even when we didn't eat it. My Som wanted more steamed rice so we ordered. 5 mins has come and gone and no rice. The server again asked if everything was ok and if we needed anything else.

Everything was as expected but the beef tripe was a bit tasteless for me, needs a bit more spices please! Also got a plate of stir fried veggies with garlic, also would be great if they stir fried the garlic and not just top it off with garlic (no to garlic breath)  Environment Very big restaurant, lots of space. The ladies come around with the carts of Dim Sum and you can pick and chose. You could also see all the bakery items near one side of the wall. Typical space, nothing special. OH! The bathroom signs are hilarious.....  Niceness of staff Um... nothing special. They weren't rude nor were they super friendly. I think with language barrier it is a bit difficult. Mostly they just want to serve you food and move on...  Dollar Small plates... about $4 a pop! Gets pricey once you start adding up! I was with another person and the bill was about $40, I wouldn't say I was full  Yes? With so many chinese restaurants in Vegas, I definitely would try elsewhere. Nothing stood out for me to definitely want to come back.   #WendyTakesVegas #WendyWanders",

I love eating the shumai and the fried pork rice but I would recommend trying everything since they are all great. I tried the curry fish ball soup today and the curry is home made with a nice little kick to the taste. What makes this place even better is the service each server provides. They are very friendly and would talk to you like you have been there all the time. They are attentive to what you want and would recommend the best food that they have. I will definitely let my friends and family know about this place as they are really good. The price is also great with the dim sum being only 2.98 per order on Tuesday through Friday.",

We ordered baby bok choy, har gow, shumai, spare ribs, taro balls, sticky rice, and baked char siu bao. The dim sum itself was hot, full of flavor, and not too greasy.

After eating all of the dim sum places all around Las Vegas, our all around was Ping Pang Pong, Hong Kong Garden, and Changs. My husband is a creature of habit and does not like to venture out what he considers as his staples. After persuading him to try what 521 other yelpers have reviewed, I am taking the time out to write a review because we agree. The atmosphere was bright and lively. The open kitchen where some dim sum dishes are made fresh to order gave me peace for cleanliness, the dim sum taste was surprisingly very good. There wasn't one bad item and I would say all around superior as a whole than the other dim sum restaurants in town. Xiaolong Bao was probably the main item I would stay was standard. The friendly customer service is the push to move Yum Cha to our now go to place. Give it a try, this place will start to get very packed.  Must order: Shrimp and Spinach steamed dumpling Pan fried shrimp and chive dumpling",

Since we went late night for dinner, there was no cart service since they end it at 2:30 pm so we ordered from their dim sum menu instead. Service started out great by our server taking our drink & food orders. They were very friendly and attentive. Everything was made fresh to order which was definitely a big plus. But everything came to our table extremely slow.... one dish at a time. At one point, we had to ask our server where and when our other food orders were coming cuz we were just sitting there..... waiting for the rest of our food to come out. We also ordered the wonton soup to split and had to ask three diff servers for bowls & spoons. Somehow, the lady who was suppose to bring it, got distracted because we saw her grab it in the back but then walked off doing something else. My boyfriend repeatedly tried getting our server's attention until the girl (who we initially asked) finally brought it to us. In addition, we ordered baked BBQ buns, which we had to ask our server where it was. He misunderstood us and thought we said custard buns. He went to the back to check on it and later told us that they ran out and asked if we wanted steamed ones instead. We were pretty disappointed but our server made it up by giving us a free dessert.   Overall, the service was inconsistent at times even with the restaurant not being busy. I can definitely say that it's not worth coming back to for dim sum especially because nothing really stood out to be amazing. There's a lot of other places in LV that have better dim sum.",

Food carts came right away before we could even sit down so that was nice. We always eat the same dimsum dishes so it's easy for us to compare. The food tastes fresh and it's not too greasy. Compared to the one place on Eastern in Henderson, this place is much better. The service is very good as well. We'll definitely come back.",

The dim sum is served all day, a rarity in most restaurants. They have the dim sum on carts until 2 pm. Afterwards, you have to go to the counter and to pick from the cases. I liked that they weren't very high pressure or no attention while we were there. My friends and I got to sit back and enjoy our food and catch up. If I'm ever in Vegas again and craving dim sum, I would go here. Also, the price was very reasonable. For three people, we spent less than  $40.",

The carts focused on the large group yet there were plenty of staff regularly checking with me and having my orders filled by the kitchen.  Very impressed with the service!!!  I usually avoid fried items, i.e. Salt & Pepper Calamari or Shirmp, as it can be cold and soggy sitting on a cart for a while - but Yum Cha will prepared these items to order so it's warm and crunchy!  Prices were good, food was good (but a tad bland).  5 stars for outstanding cordial & attentive service, -1 for a bit lacking in flavor = 4 stars.",

When we travel I make a point of hitting local spots and Yum Cha is a winner for us. Took my two dim sum eating kids and they downed the baked bao, polo egg buns, and fried rice, but the coconut rolls are just spectacular and they have a number of more exotic dishes as well. Loved the malaysian pancake and curry sauce. Solid add to the local scene, Yum Cha beats the pants off Orchid Gardens for straight ahead dim sum. Get off the strip, already, and see what the local food scene is about--it's places like Yum Cha that make it worth the trip!",

Coming from New York, the set up for dim sum was unorthodox because the waiters don't serve you the food from little carts; instead, they display the food behind the glass so that the customer can see all the possible options. Which is better in my opinion. There are no labels above the dim sum dishes so if one is unfamiliar with the Chinese dishes displayed, the owner takes time to explain which is the most delicious or popular depending on your preference- or all the dishes if you're curious. For the adventurous diners, she will push you to try something new! The prices for each dish are inexpensive. There are many wonderful entrees as well if you are not feeling in a Dim Sum mood. I would recommend the meat wrapped in bean curd skin, pork and shrimp Shumai, steamed sweet pork bun, fried sweet pork bun, and sesame red bean balls. Everything was full of flavor. Please try it! My friend and I will definitely dine here again in the near future.",

All the stuff we wanted they said \"it's cooking\". We asked 3 servers for two small bowls of rice. After we finally got our food, we waited for another cart......get this.....they passed up our table and went to the one behind me, TWICE!!!!! They only had 2 carts. VERY CRAPPY SERVICE!!!!",

Once seated it was virtually impossible to get anyones attention and most of the carts stuck to the outside tables. Only one would ever venture into the tables on the inside and they had the less popular dishes. We managed to try one order of har gow which was good but nothing else. After waiting for a half hour trying to get served we gave up. We managed to get the attention of a busboy and asked for our check which took an additional 20 minutes. We left hungry and unsatisfied.",

So I decided to try it out with my dim sum-crazed friend, who had introduced me to every other decent dim sum restaurant in Las Vegas.   Upon walking in, it was pretty late in the afternoon and the dim sum carts had ended at 2pm. After a few minutes of waiting (and they weren't busy at all), we were seated and chose our selection of dim sum from the glass display.   Our orders: Three orders of har gow Three orders of cheung fun One order of Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce Total price: $29  The FOOD took some time to come out, but came hot and good sized portions. The shrimp in our dishes were plentiful and filled us up. The SERVICE from the woman serving us was very nice and went out of her way to offer extra toppings for our dim sum and kept our waters filled. Overall, I think Yum Cha is one of the better restaurants that have filled this space which seems to have a history with high turnover.   At the end of our meal, the woman (maybe owner?) gave us a description of each dessert and I almost laughed because it felt like home when your mom makes you eat a lot of food. But in a good way. So, welcoming space and hopefully next time we'll come in to try the regular entrees for dinner.",

Went there for lunch on a Tuesday, during Thanksgiving week.  Not too crowded so service was fast.  The dim sum was very good.  Best I've ever had in Las Vegas BY FAR.  It's comparable to what you might find in Monterey Park (that's a pretty tall order).  Only regret is not discovering this place sooner.  Parking is ample, the service is great, English is spoken and understood (Cantonese too, for those who wish to speak Cantonese).  Unsure how verse they are in Mandarin (I don't speak it myself).  The design is pretty unique in that they have bird cages (with fake birds of course) hanging from the ceiling.  The tables were clean and the chairs new.  They also have a food bar where you can get things which aren't pushed around in heated carts.  And of course, they have a full menu of items you can order.  If you want something not quite on the menu, they will try to customize your order, when possible.  Will definitely come back in the future.  Las Vegas is a common destination so we'll be back very soon!",

    "text": "I don't usually bother with dim sum in Vegas but other options were even more crowded due to the holiday. Line stretched out the door (and there was an equally long line to pay) but so many people gave up that even though there were 20(!) parties ahead of us, it only took us ~30 minutes to be seated. Someone tried to steal our table but the hostess thankfully blocked them.  Doesn't compare to the dim sum I've had in Hong Kong, NY, or LA. Probably on par with what I've had in San Francisco and San Diego. They have a chaotic, inefficient system, not like the well-oiled machines I'm used to for dim sum. Between carts and going up to order at the kitchen, in 20 minutes we had only managed to get 3 dishes. Took 3 people to get our tea.  Guk faa cha: only $1/person for chrysanthemum tea! I like how they give you the rock sugar on the side, though we didn't use it. They were slow to refill our teapot, with lukewarm, not hot, water.  Cart items were mushy from sitting around, which was surprising considering how busy it was. The cart ladies would often pass us by in the corner where we were sitting.  Ha cheong fun: wrapper is a bit mushy. Shrimp on the small side. The 2nd round hadn't been sitting as long as the 1st so was marginally better, but still too squishy for my taste. 3 to an order.  Pork & chive dumpling: though they smelled good, they were bland, greasy, and the filling was hard. I felt like a dog gnawing on a rubber ball. There was supposedly shrimp in this but I didn't see or taste any. 3 to an order.  Bat tong go: sliced too thin so the edges were dried out and crunchy. Also small - I should not be able to shove an entire slice in my mouth. A touch too oily. Just the right amount of sweetness though. Comes 4 to an order but they're relatively small pieces compared to what I'm used to.  Ha gao: these we managed to get right after they were made. Instead of a shrimp ball there were 2 whole shrimp inside each one, though the shrimp they used were again on the small side. Even so, this was the third best thing we had. Getting it fresh made all the difference between this and the ha cheong. 4 to an order.  Malaysian roti: the best thing we had. Even the roti by itself was so delicious it almost was a shame to cover up the flavor with curry, even though the curry was also super-delicious. Comes with a little ramekin of delicious curry (which had some chickpeas and a few small chunks of potatoes in it). There's a serious bottleneck producing them as they're made fresh to order, there's only one pan to make them in, and only one fits in the pan at a time. Got 2, though we could have eaten a pile of them. Menu says it's vegan. Worth coming back for.  Xiao long bao (soup dumplings): the flavor was good and not sweet but there was no soup inside and the bottoms of the wraps were soggy. Despite their flaws, these were slightly better than the XLB Fat Dumpling (which I also like but don't love). Comes 3 to an order and are on the slightly small side for XLB.  Daan tat (egg custard): ordered this at the kitchen. They said they would bring it to our table but didn't ask where our table was. Half an hour later we still had none and could not find anyone who knew what was going on with them. Finally they arrived hot out of the oven nearly 45 minutes later. They were delicious (mostly because they were just made). I haven't had fresh hot daan tat in a long time so this was a nice treat. The second best thing we ate here. Comes 2 to an order and are the normal size kind, not the minis.  Steamed sponge cake: not what I was expecting. Tasted like sweet cornbread but with some almond cookie notes. Not bad but not what I wanted. They are not consistent with the size of the slice they give you, but they give you a huge hunk at least the size of your face.  Mushroom mai (shrimp and pork-stuffed mushrooms): they said they were out when we tried to order it but it came by on a cart later so we grabbed one. The shrimp and pork ball had the same problem as the chive dumpling filling in that I did not taste any shrimp, but these were less rubbery and had better flavor. 3 to an order.  They were out of veggie and potato curry puffs and pan-fried potstickers.  We did not get any of the noodle dishes, though it's of note that they give you your choice of wide or narrow rice noodles or thin egg noodles (I prefer wheat noodles to rice or egg noodles though).  Due to reaching our sweets threshold, we didn't try to get our other sweet favorites like dau saa bao (red bean buns), red bean sesame balls, mango pudding, tofu faa (sweet silken tofu), or golden lava custard buns.  The tables, chairs, and cafeteria area are not very posh but the dozens of wooden bird cages hanging from the ceiling are cute, and the floor tiles and booths look fairly new.  12 items cost $50 before tip.  They lose points for inefficiency, the lukewarm tea, hot items that got cold, and the chive dumplings, but the rest was good enough to make up for it.",

The staff is super friendly and helpful. The dim sum cart handlers promptly visited our table as soon as we sit down and thereafter again and again. We always order an assortment of pork, shrimp, beef and rice items. DELICIOUS...always delicious! Prices are very fair and competitive. Every time we visit Las Vegas, we visit Yum Cha. Do you want to experience fantastic dim sum any time of the day? Yum Cha is highly  recommended!",

    "text": "I give this place a solid 2.5 stars -  So In my opinion (just an average Joe opinion) I can't really judge dim sum super harshly but here's my reasoning for 2 1/2 stars even though yelp MADE me only give 2 stars.  We got there and this place only had one other customer. Not a great sign for Dim Sum on a Sat at 11AM. it's a big place. Lots of space and light and it looked promising.  This place was more of a order and we'll make it, or they had it made but you can tell its been sitting out a bit.   The owner and his wife seemed attentive and very nice. That's why i am giving them 2 1/2 stars. A 1 star can hurt a business and i'll never do that unless it was purposely a crappy experience.  The food was just ok.... Nothing special. I have since had dim sum like 10 times since this experience 3 this past month and honestly Yum Cha just did not cut it for me.  I waited a bit to write this review. Saw it in my drafts and thought what the hell -  There were some standard things missing. The food was just ok.  I honestly love going to vegas and I love Dim Sum - don't think i'll be back to this place though. Oh and It's expensive. I ended up dropping 80 bucks and I hated it. Go at your own risk.",

    "text": "I was super excited to try this place out. It was once a Chinese buffet before it closed its doors. Someone had posted a Roti picture on Yelp and I wanted some! Haha! As soon as I came in, it was a huge dining area and I was greeted by super friendly staff. This place specializes in southeast and southern China with a hint of Malaysian flair.  There were several carts going around the dining area and food selections available on the counter and an a la carte menu as well.The food inside the showcase and behind the counter all looked good! Forget the food cart! Haha! The bulk of my order came from the counter. You choose your food and tell them what you like. They have a partial open kitchen where they heat up your food on a skillet prior to arriving on your table.   What stood out to me were pan fried chive dumplings, lotus leaf sticky rice, fish balls, and of course the Malaysian style Roti were all delicious! The fish balls were one of best I've had and they were larger than normal. Whatever sauce used on those fishballs really paired well with it. The Roti was delicious, but prefer mine thinner. I was told that they make the curry dipping sauce from scratch and that some restaurants use curry powder. As usual, Roti and curry together was a great combination. I wish they have a sweet version of this Roti (bring on the condensed milk and sugar please)! I was so disappointed I did not order a single noodle! This ain't me! I was too full! Haha!   This is a sure return for me as the food were all done right and tasted great if not better than some of the competitors out here. They have many options to choose from that's a must try for me. It's also great for a huge group and lots of room to socialize. I stopped going to a couple of places that served dim sum in Vegas because the quality of food just went downhill as well as their service. If I can give \"my other dim sum\" place a 4 star? This is definitely a 5 star! What pushed it was the visibility of their partial open kitchen. It's located on Decatur and Tropicana. It's the plaza across International Market and next to Sushi 21.             Yum Cha, you've earned my 5 stars!",

It's either a hit or miss for me. One day I come, they have egg tarts and the next time I come, they don't. I absolutely love egg tarts so why would I come if they're not going to have it? If they know that the egg tarts run out quickly, they need to prepare more. Anyways, my family went on Tuesday to celebrate my sister's graduation and this time, they did not have crab claws with shrimp. I mean I guess.   What I would recommend:  -Steamed and baked BBQ pork bun -Fried pork balls -Egg tarts (when it is actually available) -Chicken shumai -Shrimp dumplings -Congee -BBQ pork puff pastry  -Shrimp balls -Red bean sesame balls -Taro cake   I kind of wish that they have pineapple buns on the menu but there are other dim sum places in Vegas as well. You can order by menu and there are carts that go around too.  The staff were nice and  pretty patient every time I visited. I praise them for being exceptionally patient this time with my family being those incredibly demanding/annoying customers.  I also thought that this place would be packed but there is usually one or two families. I have never seen the place filled up. Other than that, the food is good and tastes like what I've had at other dim sum places.",

    "text": "DIM SUM PLACE LOOKS CLEAN  . **2017 Yelp 100 Challenge #6** . The place looks super clean & simple & pretty big. There's none of that stuffy feeling you get when you go into a Chinese restaurant be side of old carpet & all the oils stuck in it smell.   The staff was very attentive at least the lady was super friendly. She kept checking up on us & made sure everything was good.   The food IMHO was not the best. They had items that most other DIM SUM places aren't very tasty but the MAIN squeeze basic items that I usually get were just whatever's. My main concern was the SALT & PEPPER shrimp which they even show on the tv screen slide show Of how it should be but it came out like CRAP.... If the shrimp gets too much coverage from the flour then the shell doesn't crisp up properly enough for you to eat it whole.   CHICKEN STEAMED BUN - HOT & soft  STEAMED RICE CAKE  CHIVE DUMPLING  CHICKEN FEET - perfect  LOTUS LEAF PORK STICKY RICE  FISH. STUFFED TOFU  PORK & VEG ROLL  BEEF BALL  RADISH CAKE - SO disappointed it's like they put too much flour in the mix  2x STEAMED PORK RIB - FREAKEN YUMMY  CHINESE BROCOLLI  BEEF TENDON - DERICIOUS!!! SALT & PEPPER SHRIMP - SO sad.  So I probably won't be coming back here unless the hubby wants some chicken FEET. One because you have no idea which items cost how much. Because I figured which page they are on would indicate the price but the way things were shown on the receipt says otherwise. So unfortunately when I don't trust something I usually won't be going back.",

For dessert, we ordered the sweet tofu and we were recommended the baked lava custard, which we ordered as well. Again everything was very good!

We didn't bother telling the server as most Chinese places wouldn't care, but Lien (supervisor/manager?) was AWESOME!!! She asked us how everything was tasting & asked if we knew how to eat the Lotus Sticky Rice as we haven't touched it yet, so I told her we ordered it w/o knowing that it contained shrimp, so she was so kind to switch it out for us with something that had the same value... That was such an unexpected surprise that she would be proactive in taking care of us... We were SO APPRECIATIVE!!! We'll definitely come back again... Highly recommend this place!!!

    "text": "A great restaurant should have delicious food even during off hours of the day. I came in the late afternoon and waited for a couple of minutes before I was seated. The restaurant was practically empty, only a couple people sitting in the booths but was for the most part clean. We waited over 20 minutes to order because we could not get anyone's attention. It's as if they didn't want to talk to you. Everyone was doing their own thing. I finally got the attention of one girl but then she end up forgetting about me a minute later because she sat down at another table and started eating her lunch. At this point, I was ready to leave but I saw such great reviews for this place and drove over 35 minutes to get here so I decided to stick it out hoping the food was good. Again, I was mistaken. We order 7 dishes totaling to about $28 which for dim sum, that's expensive. The dishes didn't even come with your standard 3-4 pieces of food. Some of ours came with 2 pieces! That's $1.50 for each piece, ridiculous! Now the quality of food, totally lacked flavor and you can tell it was microwaved because the inside of the food was cold and mushy. On my way out, I noticed that their fried ducks and chickens were just sitting out on the counter with no heat lamp, don't know how long that has been there. I could not believe that this place is still in business. From the poor customer service to the lukewarm almost cold food, to the steep pricing, I will definitely NOT be coming back here.",

More casual appearing than traditional dim sum restaurants, although they have the typical carts as well as a counter to order from. Food was fresh and did not disappoint.

Third, they kept checking up on us to make sure everything was okay and that we had what we needed and to top off our drinks when low...very attentive.   FOOD: They serve dim sum all day.

The dim sum dishes were all very fresh and you can tell they were just made.  They also have a counter you can walk up to and order something and see them cool it. Definitely a first having a great experience at a Chinese restaurant!   Nicely done!!!",

It's not too far from the strip, so take a taxi/uber.   This isn't your regular dim sum restaurant, least not what I'm use to. The restaurant is a little dark inside. There are carts going around, and some other things you can order to be made. The food overall is pretty good. You can easily judge a dim sum place by their chicken feet, shrimp dumpling and sui mai. All 3 here are pretty good. They have almost everything you can get at a dim sum restaurant, so if you're craving it, this is probably one of the better spots in Vegas.  I don't get the dim sum vibe here like I do most places. Maybe it's the lighting, something just feels off. But don't let that stop you, it's just me. I would definitely come back here for dim sum next time I'm in Vegas.",

Some of the stuff looked a bit super sized such as the Baked buns were about half a size bigger as well as the shumai. Everything else was standard size but had excellent flavor and the food was brought out very quickly. I would absolutely come back here and pick up a few things to go.   The leftovers were great up to 2 days later (which is how long it took me to get to them).",

I had driven by Yum Cha several times since it is close to my house, but I finally found someone to go try it with (dim sum is hard to eat alone). The restaurant itself is fairly large, and the birdcages hanging from the ceiling are very distinct. The interior was clean, and service was actually friendlier and more attentive than usual for a dim sum place. It was also not too crowded, but also not empty, so a nice balance and no wait before getting seated.  As for the dim sum itself, there is a hybrid system of a few carts that come around and food over at the counter. I haven't really seen this setup before, but anything you order up at the counter will be brought to your table. The food itself was not bad; not the best dim sum I've ever had, but I also haven't had any other dim sum in Las Vegas to compare with Yum Cha.   Prices seemed reasonable; I didn't really pay attention to how much each dish cost, but we were pretty full at the end and the subtotal was about $20 per person for our party of two.   No major complaints. Yum Cha seems like a solid dim sum place, and it's close to my house too.",

Location - it is in a strip mall as everything is in Vegas. :( However, when in Rome, it is pretty much comparable to other locations  2. THe space is large and as previous reviews it does feel like a cafeteria. There are a bunch of flat screens surrounding the entire venue and there are fake birds in wooden bird cages. Kinda cool.  3. Food and the main reason I gave a 3 stars review.  I had the chicken shui mai, shrimp and beef chang feng, century egg congee, and lau mai gai (chicken wrapped in bamboo leaves).  First it was expensive and I really don't mind paying for more, but that is not what we got. Everything was ok. HOwever, it did not justify the cost. Chang feng fell apart and shrimp was not really fresh. Lau mai gai fell apart as soon as I unwrapped it.   Of course, this was when I took my Chinese mother who liked another place and I wanted to give this a try so she of course has revoked my ability to pick a restaurant forever.  TL,DR - food not worth the cost. Lost relationship with mother.",

The meat fell right off the bones and the flavor was just right being a little sweet and salty. My favorite was probably the crunchy shrimp balls. The outside is fried to a golden crisp and the inside is filled with juicy shrimp. We also got the congee and it was also good. It was the right amount of saltiness and the century egg really brings all the flavors together. The shumai was only okay though in my opinion. They added dried shrimp on top and that overpowered the dumpling. Otherwise, that would've been really good too. Last, we got the soup dumplings and I was pleasantly surprised. The skin wasn't too thick and the soup inside was flavorful. The prices here are also great based on how big your stomach is. Each ranges from $3-$6 and comes with 2-4 items. Not too shabby...",

I'll say that the shrimp dumplings, rice wrapped in banana leaf, and baked BBQ pork buns were acceptable, but the calamari was plain and soggy. The other dishes we ordered (chicken feet, fried tofu skin, fried shrimp balls, pork ribs) weren't memorable.

The dim sum carts keep coming every 5-10 minutes. We kept ordering shumai, chicken feet, pork ribs, and shrimp dumplings. They also have good egg custard desserts. I recommend this place if you are hoping to get some dim sum for a good price while in Las Vegas.",

We were visiting in Las Vegas and shopping at International Marketplace and got hungry from looking at all the foods! We saw the Yum Cha Dim Sum nearby and thought we would take a chance. It is a large room with lots of tables and the food carts on one side. The carts started coming by and we saw some of our favorites as well as new items which was fun.   We ordered off carts but the menu has tons of choices too. Their chow neon noodles were good but not a ton of flavor. Favorites were Seafood Rolls, Shrimp Balls, Shrimp & Pork ShuMai, and Won Tons. My husband picked something he thought was BBQ pork but ended to be Beef Tendons! They were surprisingly soft and tasty. The tea is such an important part of the meal and was very good too.  Dim Sum is a favorite of mine because you get to have small tastes of so many items. Going to look at the food carts was interesting and gave ideas of different foods. We had tons of good Dim Sum selections for so little money. We will definitely return!",

We met up with a local who recommended Yum Cha for dinner.  We ordered from the Dim Sum menu and every dish was amazing.    We ordered family style, where everyone orders a dish and each dish shared by all.  There were about 8 of us, so we ordered plenty of food, and there wasn't a bad dish to be had.  When we were here, it wasn't very crowded, and the owner served our table.  She was quite pleasant and offered a some recommendations which we ordered.  She even brought a dish or two that were comped.    I was surprised to see such poor reviews for the dim sum at this restaurant, but I think I understand; those reviews must be referring to the dim sum lunches, where the carts are wheeled from table to table.   Our experience with the dim sum was quite different.  We ordered them for dinner and they were coming straight from the kitchen and hadn't been sitting on the cart for who knows how long.  If you love Dim Sum, I would highly recommend this place, BUT, maybe (based on reviews), coming during their dim sum lunch offering may not be the best way to enjoy this restaurant.",

They have carts going around and they're always walking around to make sure you have enough food on the table and picking up your empty plates as you go. Anything steamed, are on the carts, but anything fried, you have to put in an order. You can also order anything else you want from the menu. The prices are solid, the food quality is delicious, and the options are plentiful. You can't go wrong with anything here.

We walked in and the staff were very welcoming and kind to us.   They offer Dim Sum (all day) along with their full dining menu. Please keep in mind this review is ONLY for the DIM SUM.   We ordered Pork ShuMai, Har Gow, chicken feet and Pork ribs... All of these dishes were Dim Sum A at $3.58/each  The Shiu Mai looked like frozen prepackaged although the flavor was not so off. There were tiny little pieces of shrimp.   The proportions of wheat and shrimp in the Har Gow were a bit off, you could taste the dough more than the overall flavor.    The chicken feet were tasty. The sauce was a bit too thick and there were only three as supposed to the five that you normally get in most Dim Sum places.   The worst were the Spared pork ribs. It tasted like old meat, or they used expired oil. Too much fat and not enough meat on the ribs.  I wouldn't come back. Cheers!",

    "text": "Outside of the Chinese New Year Dim Sum Buffet at Wing Lei, this is my favorite dim sum spot in Las Vegas.  We came with out of town guests, who also enjoyed it as well.  Decor is very plain and simple. The food is solid, unlike most of the other dim sum places in LV, sans the crazy wait times and bad service you'll find at Ping Pang Pong.  It's my ideal choice, with plenty of easy free parking to boot.    We arrived on Easter Sunday at 11:45, as a party of six, and were seated immediately.  Tried getting reservations, but was told by the restaurant that they don't take reservations for seating on weekends or holidays.    All the dim sum was on point, and being a party of six, we tried a good amount of items.  Not spectacular, but certainly up to par.  All dishes came out hot, with the exception of the chicken feet.    My favorite here is the pineapple bun (their version of the ngai wong bau). If you like runny, oozing yolks you'll love these.  But beware, I mean runny!  When you split these buns open, your fingers will be drenched from the orange liquid yolk-like center pouring out...and, you will love it!  The dough of these buns are worth all the carbs. However, note that this is somewhat of an acquired taste.  I once shared my love of these with a friend, and we'll just say it's definitely not something she'd ever order again.  For me, and my traditional Cantonese-food loving friends though, we really loved it!   Keep in mind that the pushcarts stop coming by at around 2pm.  After that, you can order off the menu, but for me, that just isn't as fun as seeing and selecting what you want.   As Hubby always says, \"If it's Sunday, it must be Dim Sum Day\", and whenever we're in LV on Sundays, we happily often end up here!",

They also have the dim sum available all day, so if you get a late night craving (until 10 pm anyways) you can count on them to provide an authentic experience.",

Chicken ShuMai - Delicious!  Soup Dumpling - Delicous! Beef Noodle - Delicous!   Let's just say everything we've had has been fresh and Delicous!",

The spicy shrimp & pork wanton was unusual. Not one note thats forsure. It has some sweetness more than spicy. The staff is welcoming and very attentive. The food was hot.

The service was excellent, and we were thrilled that they were able to seat our party of 13 immediately. Unfortunately, the dim sum and food didn't live up to the 4-Star rating for any of us. I thought maybe our standards and expectations were just too high being from CA, but congee was super watery, under salted and lacked flavor, and the dim sum was just okay. We ordered a lot and of all the items we ordered, the only thing worth mentioning is the fried pork belly, which was recommended to us by waitstaff. Reminded me of Taiwanese popcorn chicken and was quite good. Would pass on this restaurant next time though.",

Loh Bac Goh: [8/10]      -They cook it fresh when you order.       -Crispy outside and melt mush inside.       -Decent lap churng and shrimp. Small sizing. Beef Tripe: [9/10]      -Really good and clean. Good taste. Taro dumpling: [3/10]       -Too much taro not enough of the pork filling.       -Mouth encased with taro. Needs salt.       -The outside crust is too thick I think that's what it is. Beef Rice Roll: [5/10]       -Good flavor. Too little filling. Anorexic amount of beef.  Beef Ball: [3/10]       -Flavor is ok. The texture is less meaty and more like pho beef balls.       -Dense jello? Doesn't feel like you're eating meat.  Baked Pork Buns: [6/10]       -Extremely doughy. Good flavor. Def made in-house and authentic. Diet Coke: [10/10]       -Ice cold and comes with chilled glass. Canned. Service: [10/10]      -Very nice and helpful. Attentive.   The sui mai, beef tripe and pork/veg roll were my favorite dishes. The entire meal ended up being quite expensive around $52 from what I can remember. (I did have 4 or 5 diet cokes*) Best dim sum I've had in Vegas so far but still nothing compared to the delicious dim sum in the Bay Area.   Just posting the review now. I ate here 7/7/19",

We had no trouble finding a table to seat all of us as the restaurant is rather large; HOWEVER, their portion sizes were tiny. We paid about $10-$15 per plate and each of us could only get a tiny scoop of each dish. On top of that, the meat dishes we ordered hardly had any meat in it. We felt super jipped on the Mongolian Beef dish. You might as well call it Mongolion Onions because that is all there was in it!  We did get the Hargow dim sum dish, and that was probably all that was actually worth its price.   Overall, I'd say this place is not worth it. Try finding another Chinese place, or make it out to Chinatown where you may find bigger portions.  TL;DR:  - Recommend? No - Service? Decent - Parking? Free and easy",

It's basically Chinese tapas, so everything is in small portions with the intention of sharing.

The menu had pictures and descriptions of everything- made it very easy to order. I really liked the Shrimp & Chive dumpling- it was a bigger than I expected and very flavorful. I also liked the pork potstickers and the dipping sauce- I would have liked the potstickers a little more crispy, but they were still good. I did not like the chicken in puff pastry- it was kind of sweet from the pasty and I didn't think it balanced well with savory chicken inside. Overall it was a good experience. I really wanted to try the baked custard bun, but it was too late in the evening and no more were being made- kind of disappointing. There's so much I didn't try and I will definitely be back to try more of the menu.",

The total for 4 including drinks, tax, and tip was only $60 which is about the same as back home. This place might even be comparable to Seafood Cove #2.

It's located on the strip of a strip mall across the street from the International Marketplace building. The inside is pretty big with lots of tables spread out. It's also very clean which is always a plus.  My babe and I came on a Saturday around 1-2 pm and were quickly able to get a table. We were kind of sad that they didn't offer carts going around and that we just had to order from the menu. We tried a few different things, but the Shrimp Dumplings and Curry Fish Balls ended up being my favorite. Both of these had good, rich flavor and I would order them again. The others we tried were just average to me.   I would most likely come here again when the craving calls, but I don't think it's a top favorite restaurant at all.",

Decatur and W. Tropicana Aves.  Boy, are we glad we saw that sign! This place is FUN! No crowded, hustle-bustle here, but don't let that make you believe it isn't worthy of your patronage. I think our early bird time frame may have been their less busy time.  Service is friendly, engaged, and competent. We had a table for our family (8), and they handled the varied ordering just fine. We had vegetarian preferences, tip-toe new to dim sum, and experienced dim sum addicts to deal with, and they seemed to understand.   Some dishes were delivered to the wrong individual, but really, dim sum, is meant to be shared--and that only meant that someone who would never have ordered that dish, discovered they liked it. LOL.  We had our favorites, steamed pork buns, on the menu in various forms, and then there were a lot of other new ideas for us.  No one left hungry; no one was disappointed in the fare; no one felt neglected. The tab averaged $11.50 a person before tax and tip, and we had plenty of hot tea as well. We had good food and good fellowship. What more is there?",

Was a bit dead and there were no carts of food anywhere to be seen. Thankfully we were able to order a la carte each dim sum item on the menu anytime. The service was very on point.   We ordered the usual dim sum items such as shu mai, har gow, fried shrimp ball, Chinese bok choy, and shrimp in flat rice noodle. They were all tasty and came hot and steaming as if they were on the usual food cart. But these are made to order rather than batched prior to the usual dim sum hours. Never been to a place that will make your dim sum choices made to order. This was a definite plus.  Afterwards, we were all so full and the lady came up and gave us information on their hot dessert item. Even though we were stuffed the server was sincere about the steamed custard buns. We gave in and had one order of egg custard and two orders of the amazing sweet custard bun (can have it steamed or baked I think). The custard buns were warm and crispy on the outside, but inside was soft and filled with runny, sweet custard. Both great choices to end a well balanced meal.   I would come back again and try the other items on the menu.",

It became my new go-to place when I'm craving for some dim sum :]  The establishment occupies a pretty big space and they are able to accommodate a lot of people. Plenty of tables and chairs throughout. Majority of their kitchen is open as well. You're able to see most of it behind a glass wall. It's a great way for customers to know how their food is being handled and prepared.  Our server, Elaine, was really nice and informative. She told us what menu items are their most popular and recommended a few things, including one of their famous dessert items. But when it comes to dim sum, I don't even need to see the menu. ;] It's one of my fave Asian cuisines, so I have high expectations for it. lol From the shrimp noodle, shumai, salt & pepper calamari, to the veggie noodles and beef tripe, everything was so yummy! Pricing was not too bad either. :]  Unlike most dim sum places, they DON'T serve their dim sum from a steam cart all day. Our server told us that, once lunch is over, they prepare the food as you order. This is to make sure nothing gets left to sit out all day. When it comes to ensuring quality and freshness, you can tell the difference.  The rest of the staff was very attentive and always made sure our drinks were constantly being refilled. Since this restaurant has three owners, their menu has some Malaysian influence too.  Don't pass up on trying this place out! If you love dim sum as much as I do, you won't be disappointed. :]",

    "text": "Really good food. 5 of us went to celebrate birthdays on a Sunday afternoon. We were disappointed the carts stop at 2pm. As it was a first visit it would have been nice to see all the dishes.  However after studying the rather vast menu we ordered a selection for 3 of us. Two opted for main dishes, orange chicken and chicken kung pao. Both were happy with their selection.  The dim sum was hot and fresh (the upside of no carts!) The crispy eggplant was outstanding. Salt and pepper shrimp were good but could have had a bit more pepper and a little less red onion. Spinach and shripm was good. Sugarcane shrimp was a nicely fried shrimp ball with a piece of sugar cane...different and the accompanying sauce made the dish. Baby bok choy was a bit salty.  Service was spotty. Our first order came out promptly and properly. A subsequent order was never filled.  Perhaps going earlier in the day would enhance the overall experience. But the food quslity was tops.",

Some of the food is available in the carts that they push around, but I love that they have a larger dim sum menu for you to order off of.   My favorite dish here is their roti with curry. It is absolutely addicting. Sticky rice, shu mai, and custard buns are a must order. I honestly haven't had a bad dish here.  I highly recommend!",

We arrived near opening time Saturday morning, and there were few people, which is somewhat surprising for a dim sum place. They we're bringing items around on the cart, and the few items my husband tried were underwhelming (he didn't even like their shrimp and pork shumai). It turns out, you are probably better off ordering things off the menu instead of the cart. We got several more things including their new vegetarian offerings, which appeared to be made to order. The chives dumpling and breaded eggplant were especially good, and the vegetarian shumai was juicy too. My husband also enjoyed the salt and pepper smelt. Staff were very attentive, which is rare for Dim Sum, so all in all it was actually good despite a rough start.",

My husband and I just drove in from CA and we were starving but had a craving for Chinese, we yelped and everything was closing or closed  ( 10:15pm)  we found this place and saw ..15 min left till closing and gave it a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fshot.So&s=eec2c5ba8561aefa0236a784979a7288dbbaaa6045eeb258ba12f0d2eca95cf0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">shot.So</a> glad we did!   So, we are avid dim sum waters back home, we have eaten everywhere from LA , OC to SD and this place takes it.Fresh, Fast and the service was phenomenal.They were kind and communicative.I was super shocked because usually other dim sum places they want you in and out ...sadly I expected this since they were almost closing ...but it was the exact opposite.They didn't rush us and in fact they kept asking if we would like more.  The food was fresh and tasty and the prices you can't beat, especially is you want to save some cash for the machines lol. Anyhow, so good , so happy !!! Great place and clean.",

Do we put our name on a paper list we couldn't see? Confusing. Also, we got upcharged +$3 for specially ordering something outside of their dim sum cart selections. Expected more from this spot, but only came up to be heavily disappointed.",

    "text": "I hadn't had Dim Sum in quite some time and came here to feed my hunger for some shumai and congee. No fear if you're confused as to how dim sum works, for if you can't find what you're looking for in the carts, their are menus with special items you can order.   Ladies made their way around the restaurant with their carts. Breaded and dry dishes are usually kept on a separate cart vs the hot and steamed dishes. I wouldn't call myself a veteran, but I've been around some DS places, so I knew what to zero in on.   Though the food satisfied a part of me, the other wanted a more flavorful variety. The noodle dishes were dry and lacked spice. The only thing that helped me like it was the chili sauce. For almost all the dishes, I used one specific combo of sauces. I add soy sauce with some chili  and swirl around until a good consistency. Absolute fave and the one thing that masked the blandness. Congee, usually is a bit more bland as you add some sauce, but when tasting it, it wasn't hot and lacked any flavor whatsoever. Disappointing.   Not sure If I would give a second chance, but for now, I'll pass.",

The employees were all great and deserve 5* for service and hospitality!  As for the Dim Sum on the carts: Shu Mai 1/2* It had no flavor and was simply the worst Shu Mai I have ever eaten.  The Shrimp spinach was a 3* but would have been a 5* if one could pick it up without it falling apart.   Now for the hands down winner: Xiao Long Bao ***** 5 *****. This was made to order and simply the best version I have ever eaten. It was fabulous. I would come here again just for their Xiao Long Bao.  I would suggest NOT ordering from the cart. This kind of ruins part of the over experience for me but when Dim Sum staples (Shu Mai and Shrimp Spinach) we're so poorly executed I will stick to the items made to order.",

This used to be a Chinese buffet but apparently they closed down and now it's this awesome gem of a restuarant. The food are always served straight from the steam cart or you can go up to their display that you can order from them. All the items we ordered was very authentic, doesn't taste like those cheap knock offs from Chinese buffets.   Walked in on a Thursday dinner around 3pm was a very slow time for them. Was seated real quick by the servers. The staff is very friendly, especially the lady that took our order was very helpful in explaining everything to us as beginners. In my option look no further for other dim sum restaurants besides here they are very cheap prices too. Will come back I definetly love this place.",

Just on the food we had, I would have given the restaurant a 3.5.  On the negative side, the choices were fairly limited.  We're used to going to dim sum in Chinese restaurants in Los Angeles, where there seem to be many different \"carts\" being wheeled around and at least 50 types of items.  Here, there is basically only 3 carts and maybe 20 items total.  The setting is also nothing to write home about.  Set in a strip mall, the restaurant looked dated and has the quality of a cafeteria type setting.",

When we sat down the wait staff took our drink order and that was all fine and good. But then a woman laid a FORK down next to my plate and only MY plate(I never asked for a damn fork and I don't need one!). Okay to be honest that is NOT cool to just assume that I would need a fork just because of my appearance. To put it in perspective: When someone of Asian decent walks into a Italian joint do the waiters automatically give those customers chopsticks? No. How rude! Just to prove a point I started placing dim sum on my friends plates with chopsticks. I am giving the place two stars because everyone who ate said the food was below average and wouldn't go here again. And the fact that they assumed I needed a fork because Im not Asian really turned me off this place..",

This place is just outside the strip but not in Chinatown but I would recommend this over all the restaurants in Chinatown. Also it opens very early while Chinatown is still sleeping - so if you are looking to get some comfort food early in the morning to get rid of that hangover, this is THE place you need to head to. Immediately after you enter, you are served nice hot jasmine tea, free of charge and you continue to get refills as much as you need. Promptly the dim sum cart comes along with their yummy collection of dim sums and they are all sooo cheap!!! My absolute favorites were - The Spare Ribs with the Black Bean sauce, Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf, BBQ Pork Buns and the Pork Dumplings. We straightaway did 2 rounds of each of these. We all had the Shrimp Dumplings, Chicken Feet, Chive dumplings as well, all were top class! We left the restaurant overfed and greatly satisfied only to return in the evening to get some more. The food was so good that we came for a late night dumpling fest. The staff was very kind. They recognized us from the morning and even though they were almost about to close, they welcomed us in and fed us until we we were ready to burst again.  I recommend it very highly - I will surely visit them every time I am in Vegas for all my breakfasts. Also, the staff was so friendly, I could just go back to give them a visit.",

I don't understand how this place has 4 1/2 stars with close to 700 reviews! My family waited at the table for 20 min before any server took their food and drink orders. Everything arrived slow.  The plates were hot but the food was terribly cold. We sent plates back and they never came back. The carts never came around our table, we had to get up and ask for it. We continuously waited for entrees for long periods of time.  None of the dishes came with the right serving utensils, like soup bowls or soup spoons. The complimented sauces never came with any of the dishes like traditional dim sum. When the bill arrived, my father put his credit card in the check presenter. When the server came back with the bill, it had no cc and the bill was never charged. I walked up to the front and someone from another table said this wasn't his credit card. And I said thats my father. So they charged the wrong table. I explained how bad the service was the entire time we were there and he said was \"sorry holiday weekend\" I also said I work in the service industry whether holiday or not service should not be this terrible, the cashier asked if I worked on the strip and I said yes and he said ... \"they can afford to make mistakes!\" What kind of restaurant gives you that answer! If you're off the strip you should show more excellence in customer service to avoid these comments and mistakes. I've never in my entire like experience such terrible restaurant with customer service and food!",

The items that we ordered were all really good and tasty. The quantity per order is a bit smaller compared to the others I have been to. The service needs some improvement as well. I have been to Dim Sum restaurants where you have to shoo them away because they don't stop offering items.  Can also be annoying, but when I want more and they're not coming around is worse.

Got sat down and had hot tea and water delivered in seconds, followed by a couple push carts containing my go-to dishes like har gow, pork ribs, shrimp rice noodle and beef tripe. All of the staff spoke perfect English to their guests which I appreciate even though I'm Chinese (can't always assume they speak the same language). In addition, the restaurant is never short on TVs airing a variety of food/travel video clips and shows for our wandering eyes. And the open food stall showcasing specialty foods being prepared and cooked for availability is a pretty sweet feature. Overall this is an excellent and reasonably priced choice for dim sum off the busy Las Vegas Strip.",
