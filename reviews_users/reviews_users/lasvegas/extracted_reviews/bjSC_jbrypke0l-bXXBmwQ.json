Our waiter was able to recite a long list of delicious sounding specials from memory and was well-versed in proper dining/serving etiquette .   I ordered the salmon and was truly blown away. I was expecting great, but what I got was on another level. Top 3 all-time on the salmon list (and I eat salmon a lot!). Wild-caught Alaskan salmon which a creamy sauce. Yum!   The atmosphere is very similar to what you would see in a nostalgic Brooklyn mob lounge, upscale with just enough lighting to see your partner across the way.  The price is not cheap, so don't go to Vic's unprepared. But for an exceptional restaurant away from the strip, Vic's is the place to be.",

They really talked it up so I was worried about being over sold, but it was really excellent. We each ordered the Deal for about $50 that includes a 8 oz filet, soup or salad, a side and dessert. We had to ask special for this because our waiter didn't tell us about it and it's not on the menu. (I find that strange...Ruth's Chris puts their Deal in the menu. Luckily our friends knew about it.)  The steaks were all cooked perfectly, the sides are good--better than Ruth's Chris', and the dessert was better also. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere was warm and quiet, which I really appreciate when you are trying to have a nice meal.

    "text": "It makes me a little sad to say it, but this place has declined a bit.  This past weekend we had our latest visit.  We've been there 3 or 4 times previously over the last 4-5 years.  The last time I was there in 2013, I had the best steak I've ever eaten (half of the porterhouse for 2), and this was in line with the quality of my previous visits as well.  This time, they missed that mark by a pretty wide margin.  Mind you, the steak was still excellent, but no longer outstanding, and below the quality of many other expensive, top-line steak houses.  They no longer offer the porterhouse for 2 - although they still have a porterhouse on the menu, and it is still plenty for 2 people (it is now 32 ounces, it used to be over 40, like I said, still plenty for 2 people, but you now have to split the order).  Anyway, the steak was expertly prepared as usual, but the t-bone half was tough.  I had encountered half a dozen pieces of unchewable gristle in the T-bone half.  The filet half was fine and tender, although both halves were not as flavorful as I remember.  It certainly didn't see 'prime' grade.  More like 'choice' grade.  Mind you, this steak comes in at nearly $90, so I think its justified that expectations for it be very high.  It made me wonder if with all the premium steak-houses opening across the country, it is just harder to these high-end places to get the same quality of meat as before.  On the other hand, a dining companion shared a bite of his NY Strip with me (half the price of the porterhouse -note, also 1/3 the weight), and it was absolutely perfect and delicious.    Other things that have declined.  Our favorite appetizer, \"chips and strings\" (home-made potato chips mixed with fried onion strings) was half the size as before.  Mind you, it also was still plenty - but it was no longer (as a waiter described the previous version) \"Las Vegas over-indulgence in excess\".  Now its just plain over-indulgence.  But worse was that it didn't taste good.  it had a distinct 'old cooking oil' taste to it this time, which was unpleasant.    Everything else was as before. The restaurant is elegant, the wait staff exemplary, the wine list contains many reasonable price range choices (as well as some highly unreasonable ones too, if that's you thing ;-).  But it will be hard to come back and pay the ultra-premium prices for a steak that is now a step closer to ordinary.  While I'm complaining, I'd like to add just one more thing.  While the PA music selection is nice and appropriate (Sinatra and similar), it has always been played too loud (this time and on all my previous visits).  It makes conversation at the table difficult, as you have to raise your voice to be heard over the music.  I wish they'd turn it down by half.",

We've had their steak, fish, and chicken, and several different sides, and all were excellent.  Literally everything is bursting with flavor in a way that is rare. I especially recommend the Brussels sprouts and mushrooms. But really you can't go wrong.  We rarely get restaurant dessert and I'm really over bread pudding, but succumbed to suggestions to try their \"award-winning\" version made from croissants (!). It was phenomenal!  Their service is also fantastic: courteous, attentive, friendly, professional without being stuffy. It looks and feels like an old-school steakhouse for old men with cigars but we're comfortable going as total tourists in shorts and T-shirts.  It's not cheap but it's totally worth it, and sometimes we go and split an appetizer and entree and get out of there for not a lot.",

The chicken was very dry.  It came with mashed potatoes that were nothing spectacular, just home made.  It also came with two spears of asparagus that were cooked well but bland.  We both commented that I could have made a better dinner at home.  I didn't come to Vegas to spend so much on chicken that I could have done better myself.  I was so bummed out.  We did have the scallops as an appetizer and they were pretty good on their own.  The mix that came with it had dry old bacon bits in it.  So I guess my only advice is don't bother with the chicken unless you are looking for a dried out home cooked meal arranged all fancy on a big plate.  I will say however, the service there was excellent and I give that part 5 stars.",

    "text": "Ok, so I am very torn about how many stars I'm giving V&A's. Here's my break down and I think you'll see why I  had to go with four:  Food: 4 Price: 4 Service: 5 (can I give more than five?)  So now lets talk about those points:  Food: The food is delicious. Excellent quality and flavor. I also love their extensive wine selection. We ordered- -Crab cake app: just ok in my opinion, everyone else loved it. -Chips & strings: didn't like it at all, again everyone else did. -Roasted beet & goat cheese salad: delicious. -Lobster bisque: delicious. I am a freak who hates bisque and even I liked it. -Crab legs: You don't get a ton, but these are excellent quality and just cooked perfectly. Love. -8 oz. Filet: Ordered it medium rare and that's how it came out. I didn't try it but the person who did loved every bite. -Bone-in Ribeye: Thank God for cows. Again, it came out cooked perfectly and was just... amazing. -Au gratin potatoes: Yum! -Mushrooms cooked in wine sauce: Holy hell these were amazing. My expectations were low enough that these were actually the shining star for me.  -Cheesecake: The best. Just perfection. The crust is to die for. -Flourless chocolate cake: I'm a chocoholic. This was sublime.  Price: I, and everyone else in the party, eat at top steak houses on a fairly regular basis. We know great steak and we know how much it costs. I feel like because of where V&A's is located and it is Vegas, you're sort of a captivated audience and they therefore stick it to you price wise. Is it worth it? That's up to you. It was for us. We would go back, keeping that in mind, and perhaps not go as crazy with the ordering again. Bottom line is that we would go back.  Service: I feel like I saved the best for last. I am kicking myself for not making a note of our servers name because he was superb. When you think of high dining and the service that should accompany that, this guy blew those expectations out of the water. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess and seated by an equally friendly/polite seating hostess, who just blew my mind with this next thing-- I was wearing black so she replaced their standard white napkins with a black one for me so I wouldn't get white lint on my black clothes. That's honestly never happened to me and I've been to really high end restaurants before. I love that extra attention to detail, and the pleasant surprise. Our water glasses were never empty. Everyone that works in V&A's was just so helpful and attentive. So, back to our server: he asked how were enjoying our time in Vegas and we told him that we were supposed to be seeing Elton John but the show was cancelled at the last minute. So, you know, the trip wasn't exactly going great. But we were in this amazing restaurant and had a bottle of Merry Edwards on the table, so come hell or high water we were going to have a great night. Well, aside from the flawless service we received, our server remembered our sad story and brought us a dessert plate he had put together since he felt bad for us. Um, what? Maybe this is sad statement on the people we encounter in our day to day lives, but we were all shocked. Vic & Anthony's has nothing to do with Elton John or Caesar's Palace. He could have just left it at \"I'm sorry your show was cancelled, that sucks.\" And we would have been happy and never thought anything of it. But this man went above & beyond to make sure we had a memorable evening, even if it wasn't the one we had planned.   I want so badly to give them 5 stars, but I feel like I would be cheating other people who read this review. If I was rating on service alone then I would give them 10 stars if I could. I just feel like V&A's has a small way to go with the food and especially the pricing. For my own personal taste some things just could have been better. Again, I did say we would go back if we are ever in Vegas again (which I'm sure we will eventually). Next time I'm trying the stuffed salmon.",

My husband had the bone in ribeye. We requested that both be prepared medium rare.  His steak was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.  But my steak was overdone, SALTY, and the fois gras was cold! The potatoes and sprouts were excellent, but for that price I would have expected the steak to shine!  I should have stuck with my original plan of lobster, but the promise of fois gras led me astray! We had the pecan roll for dessert which was a unique take on ice cream with nuts along with a cup of coffee.  Both the coffee and dessert were good. The service was great.

Throughout the entire meal, I couldn't stop oohing and aaahing.   This never happened to me before.  Sure, once in a while you have a great meal and you think about it afterwards.

    "text": "24 Oz. Bone-In Ribeye. Medium Rare!   Again, maybe I'm not the Steak Connisseur most of you are who frequent these establishments. I definitely have more of an Asian Fusion Tongue of sorts. But I did love my Bone-In Ribeye from Ruths Chris long ago. I had a great steak at what once was 3950 at Mandalay Bay. And I loved N9ne at Palms.  But this experience at Vic & Anthony's was Amazing! Maybe I wasn't expecting much as we were in Downtown Las Vegas, where the entire area just reeks of something so different from the likes of Mandalay Bay, Caesar's Forum Shops or even Restaurant Row down Flamingo. But it's not very difficult to recognize great service, a tasty steak, and some decent ambiance!  Like I've mentioned, I had the 24 oz Bone-In Ribeye that just may be the best steak I've ever had! Aged to perfection, and cooked EXACTLY the way I wanted, soft and juicy on the inside, some great seasoning along the outside, especially around the bone. This steak was so good I have been craving another every day since I left there! Also in our party - a Ginormous Lobster, the Sea Bass and a no-bone Ribeye. Everyone was completely satisfied with their entrees as we didn't even get to the asparagus and other sides!  Our server was extremely attentive and friendly as she also recommended a great red wine to go with our meal and threw in a couple of desserts for us to share for our birthdays (3 July Birthdays and 1 August Birthday), I thought she went completely out of her way to do that for us, but it totally completed a Great Evening there. The Creme Brulee and Chocolate Cake really did finish off our meal to Perfection!  Can't recommend it enough! Another Wonderful Dining Experience with Great friends, Great Food, Great Service!",

I really especially love the music selection (the nights I've come here, they've played 1920's-40's jazz lounge kind of grooves).  I had the rack of lamb medium rare, it was the most unflavorful lamb I had ever tasted. The sauce that was supposed to go w/it was horrible. My Grandmum ordered the filet mignon (also, medium rare). It was to die for!!! We also ordered the angel hair pasta (WAY too salty) and the buttered broccoli (very bland).  As many gripes as I had with most of the food we were served, there are also many reasons why I would come back. I will stick to fliet mignon and a bottle of wine for now on however, to ensure my visit is just fabulous!   :)",

The other table was served by a female and those seated there had a nice experience.  Overall the food was great, minus my husbands scallops, strange spicy sauce was not good. Would probably not go back as there are so many options in Vegas.  Very disappointed as it was my husband's 40th and the restaurant had come so highly recommended.",

    "text": "Best steak dinner in town so far! I was very pleasantly surprised with how good the steaks were.  My husband & I went for an early dinner on a Saturday. The place is dimly lit & has the old school darker decor with some framed pictures on the wall. There is an intimate feel but not crowded like I've seen at other more modern strip casino steak restaurants where you are seated close to others but yet can barely hear your own conversations because of how loud it is. I felt comfortable to have been wearing jeans, a nice top & heals, without feeling under dressed. It is definitely not a shorts & sandals kind of place but how many steak restaurants are aside from Outback?   Jim was our server & he was professional, polite, & came around just enough times to make sure we were taken care of but also allowed us to enjoy our dinner. His team was also very efficient in quietly clearing the table in between courses.  We started by splitting a Caesar salad. It was good but nothing special. I had the 12 ounce filet and husband had 14 ounce prime NY strip. Both were cooked to our liking & seasoned well. The steaks were moist & very flavorful. My filet was the cleanest piece of meat I have had. I had absolutely no gristle & didn't cut away any bit of it. It was tender & needed no sauce whatsoever. They were served on piping hot plates that kept the steaks very warm but didn't cook it.  We also ordered au gratin potatoes & steamed asparagus. Potatoes were slightly saltier than I liked but very creamy & cheesy and decadent. Asparagus were cooked perfectly, al dente.  The food was so good, we laughed at how quiet we both were, just savoring every bite & not saying too much.   We finished off the meal with some really good coffee & a nice chocolate mousse  that was a perfect end to the incredible meal.   Ive been to a few steak places in town but compared to some places I have been to such as Strip Steak, Hugo's Cellar (both horrible meals & we felt ripped off by the first)The Barrymore (great meal), Flemings, Mon Ami Gabi, Morton's, SW Steakhouse, Sonoma Cellar, Del Friscos, and Hanks to name a few, this was the meal we enjoyed the most!   Now the bar is set.",

I dream about those steaks.  The green beans were crisp, the creamed spinach awesome and those potatoes...OMG!  Cheesy goodness, perfectly seasoned.  The Creme Brulee decadent, rich and so satisfying.  We were such happy campers!  We ordered a bottle of the St Clements Cab, it was superb.

I've been to the finest steak houses all over the country and only a couple of them served me a rib eye as delicious and perfectly cooked  as I received at Vic and Anthony's.  This is only the second time I've been compelled to write a positive review on Yelp. I usually use Yelp to find ethnic and other interesting restaurants but this time I used it to find a good steak house and I was pleased to see the reviews were accurate.  We were a little worried about leaving our beautiful hotel on the strip to go to the Golden Nugget for dinner but after reading the Yelp reviews we had to take a chance.  I told my wife not to worry because we weren't going to be hanging out in the Golden Nugget just eating at the restaurant inside. First, I was surprised that the Golden Nugget had been remodeled to pretty high standards. Second, Vic and Anthony's makes a very nice initial impression and it frankly it doesn't really matter what casino it's located in because you'll only see it coming and going.",

    "text": "Great restaurant located inside the Golden Nugget hotel. Service was excellent- and we had a party of 14 people. The food was pretty good all around. I ordered a \"caprese\" salad to start and it was delicious. My main course was the Scallops, Brussel sprouts with grits. Fantastic. Hubby ordered the Maine lobster which he thoroughly enjoyed and finished. The king crab legs were amazing.. My nephew had six legs to himself. That 3 year old is one expensive date!   As for desserts, not amazing but good. We tried the pecan ball, which was a huge ball of vanilla ice cream with pecan nuts on the outside. Nothing special. The bread pudding was better, it came with caramel ice cream on top. I think there's slight rum in the pudding, it was good but nothing blow your mind.  Minus one star because my pineapple juice cup had lipstick stains all over the cup... That's extremely unappetizing and unsanitary. overall, for such a large party- I think the waiters did a fantastic job serving and our food was great overall. Recommend!",

The service has always been great up until the past couple years. Last night's(Friday) experience was terrible. Enough to make me not want to ever go back. For the prices you pay in that place they should be giving you the beat service around. We had reservations at 8pm. We checked in at 7:45pm and was told the table was getting cleaned up and set. The hostess asked if our whole party was here and we said yes. We waiting right outside the front door and at 8pm I walked back to the hostess and asked if we were called yet (because there was a ton of people starting to congregate in the front door) she asked what the reservation name was and if the whole party was here. Again i told her yes the whole party is here and she came back with \"it looks like they are getting your table ready\" During this Thursday me we keep seeing about 3-4 parties being seated before us and we were there first. My sister in law asked again if we were getting seated soon and the hostess said \"is your whole party here?\" Hello?! It's now 8:05pm and tons of people have been seated before us and our whole party was here since 7:45pm. The hostess walks us to our table and gives 2 of us napkins and walks away from the rest of us 4 others at the table. The waiter wasn't the best either. He was slow and had us wait to order so he could take someone else's order while he was just about to take our order. He said \" please give me 20 sec\" he goes to the next table and takes a few minutes, then came back to take our order. I'm not sure if management has changed or not but it's horrible and not worth it anymore. The food was really good, but I honestly love good service over good food. Too bad it's gone way downhill.",

I didn't take photos of the crab cake but it really is the best crab cake of my life. The petite felet with a coffee rub and the lobster tail, both perfection. And that cheesecake...... Wow!

My husband had the 18oz Ribeye, I ordered the Lamb Chops & we shared side dishes Duck Fat Potatoes & Roasted Brussel Sprouts. Everything was delicious & perfectly cooked to our liking.

    "text": "I usually do not leave reviews but after experiencing dinner at Vic and Anthony's Steakhouse, I was left with no choice. We (me and 2 girlfriends) went for a late dinner on our first night in Vegas. The ambience was great and the restaurant had a very luxurious feel to it. The General Manager of the restaurant came and greeted us himself and gave us some great recommendations. On top of that, he also brought us champagne and a crab cake on the house! The crab cake was to die for!   We ultimately decided to go with the distinctive dining menu since the regular menu seemed out of our price range. We thought the portions would be smaller due to the price. Boy, were we wrong!   I chose the lobster bisque for the appetizer and it was amazing. Perfectly seasoned and not too rich. Our server was very attentive and always kept our glasses filled. Our plates were also cleared at the very right time and the dishes were timed very well.  We each got an 8oz steak cooked to different levels (medium, medium rare and rare). All were cooked to perfection. We each got one each of the three available sides on the distinctive dining menu (creamed corn, au gratin potatoes, and broccoli). Each were full sized and between the 3 of us, we were barely able to get through half of each side. The sides were also seasoned to perfection and complimented the steak very well.  Then came dessert. Again, we got 1 each of the three available desserts to share (bread pudding, chocolate mousse, and creme brulee). The desserts were absolutely divine! We were barely able to even get through a third of each dessert and were very sorry to leave it behind.   The bill came up to about $300 after tax and tip, which was a lot less than we thought it would, seeing as Vic and Anthony's is quite a high end restaurant and the meal could have fed 6 people. Not forgetting that we did also order a bottle of wine for the table and a cappuccino each to go with dessert.  We exited the restaurant after paying and while waiting for the cab, we were surprised see that the General Manager had come out after us just to say goodbye and thank us for coming!  Overall, I give 5 stars for service, 5 starts for ambience, and 5 stars for the food (6 if I could!). We will definitely be coming to Vic and Anthony's again!",

You could see the TV in bar from my table, no big deal but when I'm paying over $100 for a meal I don't want to watch TV. The waitress was distracted or simply tired and wanted to go home. We ate late, probably one hour from closing, so the matre-de sat everyone in a tight cluster of tables to make it easy on the two servers and table staff but I didn't like sitting that close to other guests. Especially in Vegas where many diners - even in upscale restaurants -- dress and act like they are in a pool hall. I am from the Gulf Coast of Texas. The Fertita's and Macio's are legend. I wanted to enjoy my meal and write a good review. But....it just wasn't worth the price.",

Dark, intimate steak house with your typical and not so typical sides. Steak is king here, but the sides, cocktails, and seafood are fantastic. If you like raw oysters, get them here. The half dozen arrived at the table cold, briny and delicious. These were served with horseradish, lemon, cocktail sauce and a bright mignonette. The crab cake was so delicious that we ordered 2. That's right, huge chunks of crab held together with a prayer and some light binding-you almost couldn't identify the bread crumb. The scalloped potatoes were cheesy and decadent, so we added roasted Brussels sprouts. Although, broccoli is usually my side of choice. Finally the rib eye. This fine steak was buttery and perfectly roasted with a bark that could make your mother cry. Hands down, a must.",

    "text": "Back in Vegas and back to Vic and Anthony's.   This time my boyfriend and I had dinner with Dad and Stepmom as our trips overlapped. Again, it was perfect and lived up to all the expectations.   Dad got the distinctive dining menu with the filet option. He said it was a great steak. His side was the creamed spinich, which if you read my initial review you will know I thought it was slightly off mark last time, not so this time. The roux was prepared better and the breadcrumbs much more crunchy so everything didn't blend together. I am thrilled to see what was a good side made great. He enjoyed the wedge salad as his starter. Good as he remembered. He raved about the steak. He was thrilled everything was as good as before. Stepmom also had distinctive dining menu. She got the fish. She is not a seafood lover but wanted something different. She was blown away. However, because she is not a  super seafood lover she left the perfectly crisped skin behind. I can say it was perfectly cooked. It was just her personal taste. She enjoyed her wedge salad. Thank goodness she got the au gratin potatoes. They were ridiculously good and I cannot wait to go back to Vegas just to get them. Seriously, amazing. Seriously. Rich, cheesy, cooked perfectly, stick to your ribs perfection. Worth every calorie.  I got the pear and saga cheese salad. It was a bit overdressed and the cheese not well presented on the plate. Flavors were great but I am one who likes my salad lightly dressed so overdressed is going to be a little off for me. I should point out my dad tried some of mine and thought it was perfect, so I think it really is my personal taste. I would get it again and next time alert the server to my preference. I have full confidence they will prepare it the way I prefer. I ordered the  Veal Chop and it was as lovely as I remembered. Fatty and tender. Slightly overcooked and I do mean slight. I asked for rare side of medium rare and got more medium side of medium rare. however it was still nice and rare in the middle and near the bone, this is a slight issue, I almost feel silly mentioning it but I am trying to be honest.. If we had been at straight medium, I would mark them down a star. It worked out because boyfriend prefers some medium pieces and traded some of his near bone rare pieces of his ribeye. Yea for me!  My boyfriend got the bone in ribeye and it was perfection as before. Melt in your mouth and lovely. Simply the best steak I have ever passed between my lips with the exception of Bern's Steakhouse Chateaubriand. For those who know their steakhouses that is rare and exceptional company.  We got two crabcakes for the table and they were divine, just like before. They really are all crabmeat with barely enough breading to hold it together. I am not sure how they even flip it over when cooking it. My boyfriend who gets crabcakes at every steakhouse for an appetizer said it was exceptional and very few if any were better.  We shared some of the croissant bread pudding for desert that came with the distinctive dining menu. It was amazing. Everyone at the table is bread pudding fans and we loved the idea and execution. Although the lactose intolerant in the group was disappointed to see the ice cream on top. It wasn't on the menu he saw and he cannot have it. He ate around it. He did not complain because he knows he would have been accommodated if he knew to request it and the portion was so big there was plenty that didn't have ice cream on it.  Service was impeccable. We will return on our next trip to Vegas for a fourth time happily.",

I mean, from the moment we walked in to the moment we left, perfect.   I came here on a Saturday evening a few weeks ago with my friend to celebrate my 30th birthday. The only thing I wanted out of this dinner was a perfect filet mignon and a drink, and that's it. While I appreciate a nice steak, I'm very basic in what I'm looking for. I really only want to talk about the food, so suffice to say the service and ambiance were perfect. I have nothing to complain about, so let's get to the food.   Our appetizer was quail -- absolutely perfect. I wish I could use profanity to explain the amount of motherlovin' flavor on those guys. Yeah there's not a lot of meat, but oh my face they were perfect. The flavor was absolutely on point and they were cooked to perfection. I, at that point, was pretty ready to die. We also each ordered the lobster bisque: I personally thought it was on point, but my buddy said he thought it should've had more texture. My buddy ordered the special that night, which was a buffalo steak served with mashed potatoes and scallops. I ordered the filet mignon, cooked medium. Both were perfect. I mean, I'm an ok cook, but I'm in the d-league compared to the gentleman who cooked our meals.  The place isn't cheap. For us two dudes, our total was somewhere around $200. That total included 2 lobster bisques, quail, filet mignon, buffalo, and we each had one drink. All in all, totally worth it. As a matter of fact, I think I know where I'm going for my 31st birthday!",

    "text": "This review is promptly made after we had a bad experience at Oscar's Steakhouse at the Plaza. We walked out of there and my husband and i were on the hunt for a Steakhouse to still celebrate at since we both had something to celebrate this week. We found Vic and Anthony's and there was a hour wait which was fine so we put our names in to be called at 8:45. We gambled a bit and then decided to have a cocktail at the bar. We ordered an old fashioned and the basil strawberry martini. Both drinks were delicious! At 8:40 we were seated and the ambiance was so romantic and comfortable that my husband and i sat next to each other to be closer to one another and we felt like we were in our own world. We ordered peppered maple bacon for an appetizer and their special of filet mignon with mushroom sauce and a crab topped lobster tail. The bacon appetizer was just sooo amazing!! It fell apart in your mouth but was so beautifully glazed and peppery that we saved some for our steak! The steak and lobster arrived and did not disappoint like Oscars did! At Oscars our filet was burnt and didn't come with the \"Oscar style\" we asked for. This steak was beautifully cooked that it just melted in your mouth and the lobster was soo buttery with old bay seasoning on the crab. We devoured our meal!! So glad we discovered this place after our first meal was so horrible at another restaurant. I even accidentally left my phone behind and returned to get it and they were all sooo friendly! I couldn't thank them enough for such a great dining experience. We cannot wait to dine here again!!!",

Our waiter was super nice and printed it for is and allowed us to order from it. Thanks :)  I had the filet and the husband had the fish of the day (halibut). My filet was perfectly medium rare and the sides, au gratin potatoes, were to die for. For real. I'd die for them. Husband's halibut was a bit dry on top, but the flavor was very good. We also got bread pudding for dessert. Amazeballs. The other two diners we were with enjoyed their meals as well. Lobster bisque is apparently fabulous and the roasted chicken was perfect.   Go here. Spend the money ($50 for a 3 course, with side, prix fixe). You will not be disappointed.",

Decor is dark, mahogany, jazz music and white table cloths. Great atmosphere, you forget you are right in the center of Fremont Street. The service was excellent, with an extensive wine and cocktail list. I had the pear cocktail which was sweet, but a perfect start to the night. My friends had old fashioneds and sazeracs...lots of bourbons and ryes to choose from...  We started with a round of appetizers--the tartare and cheese plate. Both were excellent, but I have to call out the cheese/meat plate as outstanding. The truffle salami was superb and the three cheeses they selected were liked across all guests at the table. Next we ordered salads--all of which were VERY generously sized. I had the roasted beet salad and highly recommend! The beets were fresh and the goat cheese dressing was the perfect balance to the sweetness in the beets. For dinner I had the filet--cooked perfectly--and everyone at the table was pleased with their steaks. We tried several of the sides...MUST try is the au gratin potatoes (as long as you like A LOT of cheese) and the mac and cheese. Mashed potatoes were good, but didn't compare to some of the other options.  A few of us tried desserts...again...awesome. I had the croissant bread pudding (which was a HUGE serving...definitely share with several) and my friends had the strawberry ice cream.   All in all...great evening and overall dining experience. One of the few places that actually lives up to \"strip prices\"...Between the ten of us, we've tried several of the downtown steakhouses and this was one of our favorites! Great evening, service, we will all be back!",

Nothing on the strip or off the strip can compare to this place. You MUST check it out. As you walk in from the time you leave, First Class all the way. The hostess is very professional, the bartenders are all top notch, my server was outstanding and the ambiance was perfect for Las Vegas. We enjoyed Salmon and Crab legs with a bottle of the bubbly. A perfect and romantic evening for my wife and I to enjoy a delicious dinner while listing to the rat pack and actually see photos of the Golden Nugget back in the day is truly remarkable.

Suffice to say they stepped up again and delivered the best steak I've had the pleasure of. Our server this time was Matt (I think - he had an awesome 'tache!) was brilliant, kept the drinks coming, the tone fun and friendly, and upon finding out we were 4 hours wed brought us a free desert and drink.

The Caesar salad is one of the best in town.  service is attentive if a little rushed but activities are split up so you get lots of attention.

I selected the rib eye (duh) medium-rare and ate every. last. bite. I'm not necessarily proud of that but it was a feat for this carnivore.   The sides are huge - plenty for sharing - try the creamed spinach and mac and cheese. Heaven in your mouth, I tell ya.  Vic & Anthony's has that classic steakhouse feel.

I ordered the 12oz filet med rare Oscar style...it was almost inedibly  rare and 5 shells in the tiny portion of Oscar which wasn't really an Oscar at all even after I sent it back they just recooked the filet ruining it instead of making a new one. The sides we had were the au gratin potatoes ...ok Duck fat potatoes were terrible consistency mealy and tasted terrible nothing like duck fat at all Wild mushrooms were really over cooked. Wedge salad had maybe a teaspoon of dressing on it. The leftovers were thrown together and other not at all middle picture This was a special occasion and the only thing I can say good about it was the guy with the water was very attentive other than that it was a horrible experience  The waiter I believe 'Hector' was very pushy in the beginning,but really never checked on us later Also they charge $3 per hour that you are there sitting at the table Terrible experience I do not recommend this place at all we spent over 500 for terrible food that was unacceptable Also we were sat next to a window facing the hall of the casino where it was unappealing and people could look in at us very terrible seating and so dark you couldn't see the menu or the food just not pleasant and bad business I can't begin to express how disappointing this visit was ... we just felt like we were treated very disrespectfully I will not be eating the leftovers in the picture which is basically all my filet and who puts sides together and throws 3-4 over cooked mushrooms in a large to go container... also the waiter waited almost 2 hrs to take our leftovers from the table...knowing they had sat out long enough to go bad was disappointing as well considering he had walked by our table numerous times waiting on other tables. If we are going to pay for $70 steaks I expect them to be amazing mine was far from that.Quality of food and service was not fine dining steakhouse by any means. On a side note you have to leave the restaurant and cross an unpleasant smoke filled casino to get to the restrooms.We don't smoke so it was another downfall. I forgot to mention at the start I had to send the water back considering it was dirty and covered in food...also the wine pouring was not done correctly at all maybe this is why they keep it so dark so no one can see if their food is raw or cooked and dinnerware is dirty or clean. Update: I have been sick all day (the day after) in and out of the bathroom then back to bed ...",

I also sprung for the Russian Caviar which was exceptional, not as good as Beluga, but close. My only complaint, the wine. While exceptional, do you really have to charge 200% more than I can buy it for?   V&A, thanks for the memories, I will be back soon.",

    "text": "Without a doubt my favorite place to dine in the valley. For everything I look for in a steakhouse, V&A checks all the boxes with 5 stars: The ambiance is classically dim and extremely comfortable. The mixology and drink selection is outstanding. The wine list is expansive with excellent variety. The entire food menu is immaculate- led of course by their amazing steaks (I always get get the ribeye). Lastly, and most important to me, the service is impeccable. Personally, I have requested Pat my last two visits. Quite simply, he makes an incredible experience even better than that. I let him take the wheel now on any ordering predicaments I have while choosing my drinks, wine, sides, entrees, and desserts and he's never let me or any of my guests down. When I direct friends and clients to Vic and Anthony's, I always tell them to request Pat. Just like V&A, he's a rarity in the business. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!",

My wife and I like our meat well done (cause we can't stand seeing red or pink in our meat) and they cooked it to perfection. The filet mignon was huge and thick, cooked well done and juicy.The chef is incredible to pull it off specially with a thick piece of meat like that. Most restaurants would ask you if they can cut the meat into a butterfly but there's no need for that at Vic's & Anthony's. I highly recommend this restaurant and I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I would like to start that if I paid 15 for this steak they would be getting 5 stars.  It is my understanding that Vic and Anthony's is a chain.  This one happens to be in the lobby of the Golden Nugget in Vegas.  I love the thought of a steak house with old world charm and add that it was my birthday and the we just came in from traveling, this seemed like the perfect place to celebrate.  My favorite things to do when I travel are visiting the best steakhouses.  St whats- its- name in Indy, G something in Chicago.  Steak should always come med rare and by the most attentive staff.   I ordered the Oysters Rockefeller (my Favorite) and we each got a filet.  It was difficult to look at the menu.  It was DARK!! Not great ambience dark, but if that big screen at the bar were to lose reception no one would have been able to see. At first, since I was celebrating getting a year older, I thought my eyes were going bad.  That was until I witnessed the youngsters at the table next to me take their candle to the menu.  Tonight I was not eating with my eyes but pretty much by taste.  Our server and front server didn't show up that often, which was sad since it was my birthday, didn't need to drive to the 19th floor, and it was vacation.  I left sober.  (that's sad)  The steak was ok.  I am assuming it was cooked ok since I couldn't see.  The taste relied on the meat which in my opinion could have used a bit more salt.  The sides were ok.  Nothing to oo and ahh over.  The oysters- well I will leave them out because they did not make me happy since I couldn't see them  I will assume it was simply a flavor issue.   We decided to take our deserts to the room.  We couldn't take the creme Brule since obvi.  It was served on a plate..... not a ramekin on a plate... custard maybe  1/2 inch thick on a plate.  Odd is not the word.  But why?  The burnt sugar ratio to the creme was off and not great.  I you prefer crust over the rich creme then this is your place.   I won't come back to give it another go next time I see them.",

My wife had the shrimp scampi which featured incredible shrimp and a delicate sauce. She ordered the Wedge salad which was Roquefort, instead of Bleu, which was delicious. I had the SRF pork chop with the bone-in. I ordered it medium, which unfortunately may have been the reason it was extremely tough. It did have portions which were what the entire chop should have been, but it was a let-down. Still the experience was pleasant.",

    "text": "Just inside of the Golden Nugget lies an intimate steakhouse in the midst of chaos.    A friend and I decided a steakhouse was on our palette for the evening.  We walked in without reservations.  Luckily they do offer a full menu at the bar.  The three bartenders who helped us out were readily available with professional helpfulness.    Noah suggested the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake was not to be missed.  I concur that it was indeed a treasure on the appetizer list.  It's definitely jumbo with so much crab packed in.  The flavor of the sauce enhanced the full flavor of this lovely cake.    I am always thrilled when my friends want to spilt entrees so we can try more than one item.  This evening it was split between Roasted Salmon and Filet Mignon.  The steak was medium and perfectly pink.  It was so tender that it felt like slicing through butter.  The steak was delicious that it didn't need any sauce or extra seasonings.    The roasted salmon was good being served over asparagus and potato puree.  The roasted salmon was supposed to be stuffed with Gouda and Jumbo Lump Crab but I didn't taste much of that if any.  I still enjoyed the dish very much but has room for improvement.    The broccoli we ordered on the side was really eye opening! It was as if two huge heads of broccoli were steamed and put on the plate.  Yes this side will feed a village!   It was a pleasure to dine here and I look forward to my next visit!",

It is 4 $$$$ for a reason.  Everything is a la carte with steaks starting at $45 and going up to the high $60's range.  I ordered a shrimp cocktail.  For $19 you received 3 jumbo shrimp with their \"atomic\" sauce.  Nothing was atomic about the sauce but it was a great compliment.  While not the most outstanding shrimp I have ever had it was top notch.    For my entre I ordered the prime rib eye steak which was $64 and well sized for the price.  I also had a baked potato which was good but $9.00 good? I guess so.  What really impressed me was the whole service team.  From the waiter to the buss boys they worked seamlessly to make the evening special.  They were not the hovering type they would look at your table see what you needed and bring it.  Very intuitive service.",

Our next visit to Vegas we couldn't wait to dine here again! The steaks (rib eye & filet mignon) are cooked to perfection, broccoli crowns are huge and potatoes were perfect. Service is 5  too. The atmosphere is comfortable, a little romantic with dim lights and candles on the tables. It's definitely a mature quiet vibe - total opposite of the wild, dirty atmosphere on Fremont Street.   In our opinion, Vic & Anthony's beats HK by Cesar's hands down! Don't waste your time and energy trying to get RSVP over there. Vic & Anthony's serves up hot food from the kitchen, has great service and nice atmosphere, all of which HK lacks.  I recommend Vic & Anthony's to anyone who's looking for a satisfying meal in this area.",

The manager remembers us, each and every time.  As always we started with a dozen oysters and as expected, they were delicious! The horseradish still clears my sinuses, a feeling that both my wife and I enjoy. Now to the main course. My wife and I always share a tomahawk here. I noticed the change from Heartbrand to Cape Grim beef, so at first I was a little apprehensive as to how the quality would stand up to our previous tomahawks. We ordered our usual side of asparagus as our accompaniment to our tomahawk.  The Cape Grim tomahawk was nothing short of spectacular! The darn thing had a bone on it longer than our previous tomahawks. My wife and I actually took the bone home because we knew no one would believe us when we told them how big the bone was. The flavor of the Cape Grim tomahawk was even better than the Heartbrand we've eaten before. 40 some odd ounces of tender, incredibly flavored beef that needs NOTHING! No salt, no pepper, eat it as is, adding anything else would be an insult. I was informed by the manager that the new tomahawk is being sourced from Australia and while it did cost more, it was worth each and every penny...and then some.  My wife and I got a complimentary creme brulee despite the fact that we were stuffed after putting down that monster steak. But, we did finish our dessert as something sweet after eating such a comical portion of meat really hits the spot. Make no mistake, next time my wife and I are in Vegas, we're eating here again!",

Had the maple bacon and it was one of the best I have had.   Our drinks were never empty.   Looking at some they comments here is my take:   Being from NY and Italian bread is a staple of life. The bread they served was hot and quite good. Add the butter on top and yum so not sure what others thought.  People were upset dinner is a la carte and sides are extra but that is what you get at most steakhouses in any major city.",

The hostess guided me to the bar, where a random waiter ensured that I got a seat. I ate at the bar -- Noah was the barkeep that night -- and wow he delivered. Noah has a deep knowledge of the food menu, as well as cocktails and wine. He even went so far as to sample up several different wine varietals that could pair perfectly with the steak.   I went with the 8 ounce filet and lobster tail combo. Both came out superbly. Many restaurants err on the side of cooking a medium-rare steak too long. Not here: it came out just the perfect shade of deep red in the middle, yet still warm, and nice pinkness on the outside. The lobster tail was fluffy and tender -- no need for a knife, just melted off the fork. The chef himself even made an appearance to talk meat with the bar patrons.   I am telling you, treat yourself to an epic dinner and get in here.",

Many of us had the special, which that night was Surf 'n Turf (Filet Mignon and Lobster Tail). Many of us got a side too, all of which were large, and we shared them among the table. Portions were large, it was hard to finish it all. Definitely worth the $$.",

I believe our waiter's name was Hector (sorry if I'm wrong :/) but he made the experience one to remember. The food was soooooooooo spot on. I actually enjoyed the sides (loaded baked & bone marrow) more than the steak - but the steak was phenomenal! Worth the price. Atmosphere was fantastic - except for a couple of bros acting way out of control behind us. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",

    "text": "BT and I went here because it was recommended by our friends. I didn't realize it was in the Golden Nugget and was worried it wouldn't be that nice inside. Boy, was I wrong. I was completely blown away by the gorgeous woodwork, the ambient lighting, and overall old school \"fancy\" feel. The hostesses were great and welcoming. Our server was amazing. He recommended great wines and let us have tastes when we were indecisive of what to order. We were lucky to have stumbled upon the distinctive dining offer. What an amazing deal. We first started off with the lobster bisque. My goodness was that ever decadent. So flavorful with big chunks of lobster. They did not skimp with the serving size either. Next, we had the 8 oz filet mignon. Perfectly cooked to our desires of medium rare and medium. They also had this peppercorn sauce on the side. It was a perfect complement to the meat. Not overpowering, but a great enhancement. We chose the broccoli and au gratin potatoes as our sides. I was awe-struck by the portion sizes. The broccoli was HUGE. I am not exaggerating either. It had an awesome flavor- far from your average steamed broccoli taste. The au gratin was rich and decadent. All of this yummy goodness paired with a nice, generous pour of Malbec. For dessert, BT had the bread pudding, which he LOVED and I had the lemon sorbet. What I appreciated most is that our server was very concerned with my allergies, and went to find out what I could have in lieu of the pre-set dessert choices. The service was top notch and we never wanted for anything. This was a very special experience of amazing service, food, and setting. Definitely worth the 151 dollar tab (not including tip) So, Treat yo' self to Vic & Anthony's. You deserve it.",

    "text": "The meal was AMAZING! Well worth the money.   I had their pre-fixe menu (check their website, you have to bring a print-out with you to get the price); I got a Caesar salad, 8 oz filet mignon, au gratin potatoes, and creme brulee all for only $52. Amazing! My husband got the special of the evening; an 8 oz filet mignon and 5 oz lobster tail.   All of the food was phenomenal, but I have to say the potatoes au gratin were above and beyond the highlight of the meal. They were by far the most amazing potatoes I've ever had in my life--possibly more cheese than potatoes? Creamy and delicious and just to die for. I also really enjoyed the creme brulee; it was provided on a dinner-plate-type dish, so it was only about an inch deep or so. This meant that every bite had a piece of delicious caramelized crispy topping (which was beautifully done without a bit of burnt sugar).   The atmosphere was lovely; dark and intimate and quiet. The service was wonderful, and the cocktails were good as well. All in all, the meal was in the top three in my lie! And for less than $200 for two people, that's downright affordable!",

We ordered from their Distinctive Dining menu (see their website for details) and was not disappointed at all. Ceasar salad and Lobster Bisque were our starters and was delicious.  The fillets were seasoned well and medium rare-medium. Potatoes Au Gratin was superb. Brocolli was cooked well. But lastly,the highlight was their bread pudding ~ a must have to order!  Will definite be back!",

    "text": "I'm just going to be honest and let you all know that my memory of eating at this particular steak house is a little fuzzy because I had been playing blackjack and drinking champagne for, oh about 7 hours before realizing that if I didn't eat dinner now!, then I would have to eat at a diner or some form of 24 hour place and it probably wouldn't be as good. Also, Nick has a tradition of wanting to eat at a steak house at least once while we are in Vegas and this was our only chance on the short trip we took there recently.  With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the meal and I'd easily go back again. I ordered a classic filet and Nick ordered a strip and both were cooked perfectly. We also shared some of the mac and cheese (sooooo good), the Brussel sprouts (eh, average), and a chop salad that I really enjoyed. And while I know it's not part of the menu, the bread and butter were worth mentioning as well. I'm normally not much of a bread person, as I prefer my carbs in the form of purer sugar, but man alive! I couldn't stop eating this stuff.  While it isn't the high roller steak houses you can find on the strip I think the quality is definitely great here and you also miss out on the waits and attitudes you might find in some places on the strip. Plus the cost, while high, wasn't as high as some of the other steak houses I've been in Vegas. More money for doubling down is always a good thing!",

We weren't planning on coming to Vic & Anthony's but at attempts at four other places downtown - 2 were closed, one had some kitchen problems which made about 90% of their menu unavailable and one where we waited 20 minutes without even getting water before we left - so we were pretty over it and hungry by this point.  Our waiter Dez was above and beyond, giving recommendations and really getting a feel for what we wanted.   We went with a Caesar salad, crab cake, Mac and cheese and a rib eye with red wine. The meal was wonderful. The salad had just enough anchovy taste but very light dressing so you could really taste the crisp lettuce and shaved parm. The crab cake had generous lumps of crab and was breaded nicely. Our steak was perfectly cooked with a nice char and salt on the outside while being tender and pink on the inside.   Coupled with amazing service, it was a meal way above and beyond what we were expecting.",

It's been a while for me, however, Ruben took his mother for her birthday last year since we enjoyed it so much and they had a great time!   We started our meal with the Calamari with Sweet and Spicy Peppers ($13), Beefsteak Tomato & Onion Salad with Roquefort Cheese ($11), and Lobster Bisque, finished with Cognac ($11). I enjoyed the sweet and spicy sauce on the calamari and the bisque was delicious. The salad was good, but disappointingly scarce with three slices of tomato and four very thin slices of red onion.  Ruben and I both enjoyed an 8-ounce Filet Mignon ($39) with Wild Mushrooms ($11), Steamed Asparagus ($10), Macaroni & Cheese ($9), and Sea Salt Fries ($8) as our accompaniments. Their steaks are USDA Prime Midwest Grain-Fed and were perfectly prepared (medium rare) and really delicious. We were very pleased with all the side dishes as well.  Service was spectacular and we enjoyed a complimentary chocolate cake at the end of our dinner. Vic & Anthony's has been a highly recommended steakhouse choice for both of us and we will always love to return!",

I was really excited... never been here before and it was my first time meeting his dad & step mom.  I'm not a steak eater but I fancy other things :D For starters we shared the calamari, crab cakes and portobello mushrooms. The crab cakes are phenomenal here! Probably one of the best I've had. My bf ordered the prime rib, his dad ordered a filet and his step mom and I ordered the lamb chops... with baked and mash potatoes. Everything was perfect! For dessert I had their flourless chocolate cake! If you love chocolate, try it... it's on the rich side.  Our server Bo was really excellent in customer service!  Great ambiance and amazing food!  If you're looking for a steakhouse, make it V&A!  - Miss Yelp 2011",

    "text": "My friend was adamant that he wanted a great steak as soon as we got to Vegas. Since we were staying at the Golden Nugget, I found this place and made a reservation. Couldn't have been easier to find; it's located right at the front entrance, right by front desk. As soon as we entered, we were very warmly greeted.  Our server couldn't have been friendlier. He was very helpful in letting us know all about their menu. The service was so prompt, every time I used a  packet of sweet and low, he was there to pick up the mess. I found this very impressive considering they were very busy.  In short, the service was first class.  As for the food: Simply Amazing.  I had the Prime Ribeye and my friend had the combo Lobster with Filet Mignot.  Hands down the best steak I've very had. No fat whatsoever and very tender. I also wanted a salad and when I asked how big they were, he told me he could split it. So they brought it already prepared in two separate bowls.  I thought this was awesome cause they could have been dicks and said, \"no you have to buy them separate\".  This place is a bit pricey but for Vegas, it's actually fair. Only negative: believe it or not....this place has no restrooms.  That's right, NO RESTROOMS.  You have to go into the casino to use the restroom.  When I asked why this was, he told me because this was a very old building and it was never restructured to accommodate restrooms. Aside from that minor hiccup, I highly recommend this place for amazing steaks.",

    "text": "WOW...  I don't give many 5-star ratings. That being said, Vic and Anthony's earned all 5 with ease....  We dined here on our last night in Vegas.  Being from Houston, we were familiar with the Vic and Anthony's brand, as they have a restaurant there.    We actually stayed in the Golden Nuggett so we wanted to have a good last night dinner somewhere in Downtown Vegas.  We'd already been to Hugo's Cellar before(awesome by the way) and we had heard Binion's Steakhouse was quite good.    We dropped by Binion's but changed our mind at the last minute and went to Vic and Anthony's instead. In retrospect, this was a excellent decision.  The restaurant is not that spacious however, on the other hand, the coziness provides the dining couples with a much more intimate and romantic experience.    The waiter was very courteous and immediately wished my wife a happy birthday (earning valuable points) and then guided us through the wine menu and liquor/after-dinner menu.  The wife had a crown and 7.  I had a Makers Mark 46 with a splash of 7.  If you like Bourbon, give Maker's Mark 46 a try.  Both drinks were prompt, cold and stout, just the way they should be.    We skipped the appetizers altogether and went straight the entrees.  I do hear, however, that the crab cakes are quite good  Because they serve such large portions, we shared a 16 oz. Prime Ribeye cooked to perfection.  As sides, we had the Creamed Corn and Truffle Mashed Potatoes.  All were wonderfully flavored...  If you order a topping for your steak, I highly reccomend the Port Peppercorn. Have them serve it on the side, instead of on top of the steak. You won't be disappointed.    For dessert, we shared the flourless Chocolate Cake.  This was quite good but a little too rich for us.  Should have stayed with the tried-and-True Creme Brulee.    This place was almost as good as Hugo's Cellar in Vegas and Pappas Steakhouse in Houston.....very very close.  If in Vegas, either Hugo's or Vic and Anthony's would be an excellent choice.",

We started with the crab cakes, they were huge chunks of crab meat and held together well, and with incredible flavor. It is not often to find exceptional crab cakes. The tuna poke (I often eat poke all over the world) was also exceptional with complex flavor and I always love generous helpings of avocado.   We ordered a 40oz tomahawk rib eye, which surprisingly, was my least favorite item of the meal. I think I would have preferred a boneless ribeye, although it was very tasty as well.  The mashed potatoes and spinach dish were flavorful and enough to go around for 3 people. The finish of the bread pudding was out of this world delicious. We also enjoyed a couple of bottles of wine and appreciated the sommelier's recommendations. Can't wait to eat here again!",

We got a cheese plate to start, great cheese selection and accompaniments. I ordered the filet with lobster for dinner, it had a raspberry rhubarb reduction on it and came with wild mushrooms and carrots. Cooked a perfect medium rare. Lobster came with a chive butter sauce on top.  My man got the filet as well with a side of macaroni and cheese as well as the broccoli. It was all so so good. I honestly can't put into words so much I enjoyed this meal.   When I made the reservation on open table I had informed them we were celebrating a birthday. Usual nothing comes of this, however this time we were surprised with a duo of delish mini cakes and a lit candle. It was nice.   It was an expensive price tag, but so worth it.

A group of work colleagues and I decided we wanted a nice meal after walking Fremont street and this restaurant was recommended. Although it was later in the evening, our party of 8 was quickly seated and drink orders taken. Our waiter (Matt) was attentive and offered many recommendations for starters and house specials.  This is a high end steak house, so expect to pay high end prices - but, the food we had was well worth the cost!  I recommend starting with the crab cake and calamari and then having the filet and a side of the duck fat potatoes (oh so good!).  I deducted 1 star, as one of my colleagues had to send her steak back, as it was too well done (she'd asked for medium-rare). She said her second steak (ribeye) was phenomenal though and now has the nickname \"2-Steaks\".   If you make it down Fremont Street way, check this spot out.",

The steak was amazing both times, really solidified my belief in Las Vegas being the leader in Great Steak and wine  This night I went to a special dinner where they paired one of my favorite breweries, evil twin with a special tasting menu. We had a cocktail in the bar before dinner started, I had the lavender lemon drop martini, which was outstanding. Our dinner started out with an oyster Grenada accompanied with a wonderful sour beer. Second course was a soft shell crab paired with another sour beer. I'm not a huge fan of sour beers but they paired well together. The third course was by far my favorite of the foods. We had a smoked chicken fried duck breast on top of a Savory waffle with a stout syrup. Dinner on fleek! The main course was a trio of Sliders one of which was ostrich, the second wild boar, the third was bison,  all accompanied by a truffle tater tot.   The dining experience was amazing our server for the meal, Matt , was attentive respectful, knowledgable, and gracious. He really made our night, and I will definitely be back because our dining experience would not have been the same without him. Knowing that he is there full time for Great Steak and wine will make me come back. I can't wait to experience this little slice of old Vegas again and again.",

    "text": "I haven't written a review on Yelp in YEARS.  Not because I'm lazy or selfish... just nothing has really inspired to commit to giving a public opinion.  That is, until I went to dinner at Vic & Anthonys with my father a few weeks ago.  My father, a True meat and potatoes man, is a hard person to please when it comes to steaks.  He's had some of the best you can imagine, so as you might think, it would be a tall order to find a spot that could meet his lofty expectations.  Well in all honesty, it's actually not too hard to do so in Vegas - being the steakhouse-heavy city that it is, but to do so without breaking the bank, with unmatched service, an inviting ambiance, and excellent food is nearing on the impossible.  But my fellow Yelpers, I am proud to say that Vic and Anthony's has done the impossible.  Their secret online menu is arguably the best priced prix fixe menu in town, everything we consumed was A quality (+steaks cooked to perfection), ambiance was quiet and welcoming, and our server was classy, respectable, and friendly all at the same time.    One Example from the Evening -  So we just received our steaks and had forgotten to order bernaise sauce with them.  I got my waiter's attention and told him we would happily pay for the additional cost.  At which he told me that the kitchen was about to close but the chef was going to whip it up for us for free... awesome.  After about 5 minutes of waiting, he felt bad for making us wait for the bernaise and brought us by two free cocktails, double awesome.  Mind you, we had barely waited 5 minutes and were in no way offended with the wait thus far.  Going the extra mile when you definitely don't have to really sealed the deal on an already excellent meal.  TL;DR - Vic and Anthony's is one of the best steakhouses in Las Vegas.  Fabulous service, excellent food, and amazing price (especially if you use their secret menu... found on their website).",

    "text": "I really enjoyed Vic and Anthony's.  I had scarfed down a ton of prime rib, the other night, I decided to switch it up and go with the pork chop.  This wasn't a terrible idea because the steaks were more expensive  than the pictures of the menu posted on Yelp.  If you go with  steak, expect to pay no less than $50 without any sides.  I was impressed with all the great flavors of the pork chop, but the thing that convinced me to award 5 stars instead of 4 was the lobster bisque.  Hands down, this is the best lobster bisque I have ever had.  If you're on the fence, don't be... It is amazing.    As someone who loves to take pics of my food, I was little bummed that Vic and Anthony's was too dark to get a good shot.  I took 6 pictures and none of them do this meal justice.",

It all came cracked and was presented beautifully. The bone marrow was to die for and our waiter was a sweetheart. The only negative I can say was out wagyu carpaccio was a bit overwhelmed by olive oil. Besides that amazing atmosphere and staff!",

The restaurant  has an elegant, but intimate feel to it.  Everything we ate (salads, bread, and entrees) and drank was excellent; I had the tuna and my partner had the scallops.  We both agreed that they were the best we ever had.  The next time we're in Vegas we will give the service another chance...but will ask for another server immediately if we get HER again:).  BTW, the restaurant is on Fremont Street inside the Golden Nugget... which seemed a little odd considering the restaurant is top notch!",

However, Vic and Anthony's was amazing--a shining beacon in a land of sad, $7.95 steak dinner offers.  As said by others, this place is comparable to any fine dining place on the strip and the prices are very reasonable.  Our waiter (coincidentally named Anthony) was incredibly helpful and friendly.   My boyfriend and I had wedge salads--huge and very good.  The only thing that would have made them better would have been some bacon.  (But honestly, doesn't everything need a little bacon?)  We then split the ribye and crablegs special.  OMG.  Best. steak. EVER.  It was perfectly cooked and amazingly tasty.  Perfectly seasoned, tender, and had a great beefy taste.  No steak I've ever had (Ruth's Chris, Mortons, Mastro's, Houstons...) was this good--and I love my steak.  Plus, the crablegs were huge!  I can't even imagine the size of the crab who lost his legs for my meal--he must have been the Shaq of crabs.  We also had the creamed spinach, which was good, but not great.  It was very cheesy and a bit spicy--in a good way.   Based on the fact that I came for steak and I was rewarded with the best steak I've ever had, I give Vic and Anthony's 5 stars.",

We went with their silver menu and I cannot express how delicious everything was.  I was so full from the jumbo crabcakes and shrimp cocktail appetizers that I could barely eat my perfectly cooked filet mignon or the au gratin potatoes.  Also, the slice of cheesecake they put in front of me I thought was to share with my fiance, but then they put another slice in front of him.  I mean they were absolutely huge and the seasonal sorbet was delicious as well, ours was strawberry.  I know that everyone at the dinner fully enjoyed all the food since we took all the leftovers back to the hotel and every piece of leftover was eaten by the time we left the following Monday.  The servers were great as well with drinks, as soon as you started getting low, they would be asking you if you wanted a refill.  This was the perfect place for a smaller, intimate group dinner and hanging around Old Town the night before was amazing.  I will highly recommend Vic & Anthony's to everyone having their special day in Las Vegas.",

Maybe I just had too high of expectations, but I've been to a better steak house in Reno. I'm not saying it was bad, but just not great. I ordered the Prime Strip and it was cooked exactly how I ordered it, but I wasn't too impressed. My husband ordered the veal which was pounded very thin and breaded, it seemed there was more bread to meat ratio. I also ordered the onion strings on the side, which came out as a huge mound on a plate (not very appealing) and they were mediocre, no better than you would get at a fast food joint. Luckily the desserts were delicious. I ordered the pecan crusted ice cream with caramel sauce, it was amazing. I can't remember the dessert he ordered but it was so good he was tempted to order another. So overall I think it was worth 4 stars. I don't think I would go back during future trips to Vegas, I'd like to try somewhere else.",

We do not drink alcohol, and the waiter (Ben) seemed to take it as a personal offense when we declined to see the wine list.  My husband does not eat red meat, so he inquired about the chicken.  Even more offended, our waiter proceeded to tell us that \"it's cooked in a pan\" and literally just stared at us.  Finally, he said \"We're known for being a steak house.\" I think I saw him roll his eyes, but it was kind of dark in there.  I even chuckled to myself when he mentioned the high priced lobsters that he is sure we noticed in the tank on the way in.  What made that statement funny was the fact that I did look at the tank as we walked by, and it was completely empty!!  Our waiter was so rude that we basically couldn't wait to get out of there.  Needless to say, he treated us with absolute contempt when we declined the dessert menu and the after dinner cocktails.  When my husband put the gift card and additional cash in the bill binder, the waiter actually said \"I presume this is a gift card of some sort?\" then scampered off to verify it before we left as though we were some losers who planned to \"dine and dash\".  Although our meals tasted really good, it was a horrible experience.",

    "text": "Ok. the bottom line is i ate the BEST steak that i have ever eaten in my life at this place. I was familiar with all the stellar reviews and decided to venture to Freemont to check out Viv and Anthony's. I am a huge foodie and use yelp and trip advisor to help guide me in selecting top rated establishments. I was in the mood for a steak that rivaled my previously favorote steakhouse in Vegas: Mandalay Bay's Strip steak. I was a bit skeptical that Vic's could equal the cut i had at Strip Steak. Man was i wrong. Big time! First off, i don't mind splurging for a pricey steak every once in a while as long as it is worth it. Even though i really liked Strip steak a lot, i was simply not impressed with the 18 oz size. I know for most people this is plenty big. But if i'm paying a premium i expect at least 20, preferably 22 or 24 ounces for a 65 dollar steak. Vic's bone in ribeye clocks in at either 22 or 24, and let me tell you: when i first saw it the first thing i thought to myself is \" it's a good thing i'm pretty hungry.\" The server brought it out and warned me to be careful because the plate was piping hot. He then told me to cut into it to make sure it was medium rare as i requested. I did so and it could not have been cooked more perfectly despite it's size. i took the first bite and the flavors burst through like no other steak i had ever tasted. The damn thing was so juicy that i had a little puddle that formed in the botton of the plate that allowed me to simply enjoy at as a de facto steak sauce. I cut the steak into multiple bite size pieces and completely destroyed every bite. The most amazing thing i noticed was that each bite was just like the first. It was as if my palate was cleansed after  every bite. The ladies sitting at the bar next to me were in awe that i devoured the sizeable cut in such short order. I told them that i simply couldn't help it. The damn thing was just that incredible. Needless to say Strip Steak is a thing of the past for me. THIS place is where i will eat steak exclusively in Vegas from here on out. Keep in mind how incredibly difficult it is to garner 4 1/2 stars on yelp after 200 plus reviews. This place has earned every bit of the hype. The atmosphere is intimate and has that old vegas vibe. I went on a Saturday night and there was a line, so i sat at the bar. I knew when i saw the crowd that the place must be something special. And it most certainly was. My meal consisted of oysters rockefeller that were pretty good. A bit too much spinach and parmesan, but the oysters were big and very tasty and their flavor wasn't at all overpowered by the toppings. Unlike most places. Next time i'll simply request a little less of both. I ate my steak a la carte because i knew it was huge and i didn't even want a salad to go with it. The 65 dollar cut i had is known as the chef's cut and believe me: It was worth every single penny!",

Came here for my friend's wedding dinner in July...now, I wasn't expecting much...but everything was so delicious, I think that even the water was perfect!! hahahahah! !  The waitstaff was friendly and professional.  My favorite looked like Doc from Back to the Future; he even did a voice impression for me!  Everyone, EVERY single one of us was perfectly content with our meal:  from the calamari and tomato/mozarella (?) appetizers to the Salmon, chicken and Filet Mignon.

But what was really amazing was the steak and chicken.  Everything just melted in your mouth.  But if you eat here you absolutely have to have the creme brulee.  It is served on a plate instead of a dish.  The best meal we have ever had by leaps and bounds.  If we go back to Vegas, we will be stopping back here.",

    "text": "My wife and I ate there to celebrate her birthday, although a little early. Stopped by around 2PM to make a reservation and the girl seemed to be bothered by the request. The first thing that put me off was the fact that most people were wearing jeans and t-shirts, a few had shorts. When I am spending $300 on a special occasion I like to dress up a little, if I wanted to sit next to loud and drunk people in jeans and sneakers I could have saved over $200. Service was very good but not perfect, plates stayed on our table for 10 minutes after we were done. Filet mignon was the best I ever had while the rib-eye was ok, lots of fat and one side was very tough. Both meat dishes were done as we ordered. Quail appetizer was sublime, I would like to see them try this with duck or pheasant. Asparagus side was very good while the scalloped potatoes were very very rich, enough for 4 people. Creme brulee was good but on a saucer plate and only 1/2 deep. Espresso was the worst I have ever had, looked it was a cafe latte as it was not black. Waiter took it off the bill and said it was a little lite? We will go back for the filets and the quail.",

I had a bunch of ladies from the Bay Area in town and so being the Big Baller I am I took them here for dinner. We started with Dom and oysters (can't ever go wrong with Dom and oysters) the n on to the stuffed quail and a cheese plate for apps. Now mind you we were a bit intox. so we were probably high maintenance but the staff took very good care of us. Our drinks whether it be cocktails, water or wine were never empty and every time someone got up to go to the bathroom (which was frequent as we were partayin a little especially towards the end of the meal) our napkin was collected and folded neatly and left in its place. We all ordered steaks and a few of us split a 3 lb. lobster. Everything was fuckin incredible. We ended up drinking a couple of bottles of Quintessa as well as some Silver Oak. The service and the meal really flowed well. We were never waiting for the next thing. One of the best meals I've had in Vegas. I highly recommend it.",

Don't get me wrong, it was a good, but not great meal.  The problem is that it's priced like it's Delmonico, Cut or Carnevino.  And, it ain't those places.  My wife had the special, which was crab stuffed lobster.  The lobster had a strong fishy odor, which indicated to us the lobster was not totally fresh.  Perhaps this was why it was used for the stuffed lobster rather than being steamed and served whole.  She had the filet, which was fine, but not overwhelming and certainly not worth the cost.  I had the ribeye, which again was fine.  Certainly better than your neighborhood Outback, but not worth anywhere near what they charged.    Service was adequate.  The wine list was average I would say, probably decent for downtown.  If you plan on spending this much on a meal, I would recommend Prime, Brand, etc.....",

    "text": "I really enjoyed Vic & Anthony's.  This was actually my first time walking through the Golden Nugget after the renovations and it was great to have had a dose of Fremont after spending so much time in the past few years on the Strip.  Alas I digress!!   Okay... so, you come to Vic & Anthony's for the fine dining, great steaks and dark atmosphere that really gives it that nice touch of \"Oooh, fancy-smancy!\"  V&A delivers on all fronts, walking in across the selection of cuts and lobster aquarium, through the dark corridors and to a nicely spaced dining area you really get a sense that you are in for a treat.   The service is wonderful, our server was very accommodating and attentive.  Our food came out fast and drinks were consistently filled to the brim.  Absolutely NO complaints here, I would say the service is some of the best I've received in all of Vegas.  FANTASTIC!  The meat (the important part right?) is great but not pinnacle of all steak houses in my opinion.  I ordered the rib eye ($55) and had a taste of the bone in cut that clocked in at about $69 dollars that night for a 21oz cut (Market Price).  I enjoyed the marbled taste of both ribeye but the flavoring was a bit peppery in some areas as the seasoning did not appear to have been spread across the entire cut as well as I had hoped.  I had a chance to sample the filet mignon as well and that was great, but again not something that I immediately fell in love with.   Overall a very fine experience and I will definitely be back, however when it comes to my FAVORITE steakhouses I'd have to still say Ruth's Chris and Craftsteak are still my favorites.    Definitely worth the try for EVERYTHING as an overall package.  Thank you Vic & Anthony's :)",

My fiance ordered the special of filet m. steak, mashed potatoes and lobster tail. He is a harsh critic when it comes to food. He was very satisfied with his meal.

We were seated, it is a nice place like any other nice steak houses in Vegas. When the waiter, Jay, came over to take our order, I felt he was very rude!! He acted very impatient with us, as if we couldn't order fast enough. When I would try to ask him a question, I felt he ignored me! He pretended he could not hear me. This happened quite a few times. They also didn't leave he right number of water glasses on the table so when we let him know, he made my mom feel as if she was bothering him!! It was terrible!!!   Then dinner came out... And the steak was actually pretty good!! They were cooked just the way we ordered, which I have found a rarity in the steakhouses around Vegas! The salt they sprinkled on top really made the difference!! The creamed corn was delicious! Kids loved it! Mashed potatoes were not good, over whipped and you could taste it was really gummy. My mom ordered the plain 3 oz lobster... But our waiter Jay brought out the stuffed lobster. Well my mom thought it was what she ordered and we didn't know until we reviewed the bill later in the night... But Instead of her $30 lobster she ordered, He wrote down the wrong thing (feeling as if it was an intentional mistake) and charged her $80!!! So watch out!! Clarify your order because they can be sneaky!!!!   And RIGHT after dinner came the bill!!!! Not once did Jay ask if we wanted coffee or dessert!!!! We had two tables side by side to fit us all, well the other table got coffee, he didn't even ask our side!!!! Who does that????? Very rude!!   I truly feel our waiter Jay did not want to \"deal\" with any of the women at the table, he just wanted to talk to the men!!  He was the one who brought the credit card back to the table for us to sign... He handed it to my dad (it was my card), so I told him \"I'LL TAKE IT!\" Loud enough to make sure he heard me!!! He then handed it to me and said \"this card?\" I said \"ITS MINE!\" And once he knew I was paying, he was all smiles and thank yous! \"Thanks for coming have a great evening blah blah blah!\" Unfortunately the tip was included since we had such a large party. He was lucky it was!  Not sure if I would go back there because of JAY! For $400+ I expect MUCH better, more respectful service!!!!!!   The gentleman who bussed our table, Richard or Ricardo (I can't remember his name!) he was amazing!!!!!!! I wish he was our waiter!!! So attentive, very polite! He acknowledged my kids!!! Made sure no hot plates were in front of them!! Where as Mr Jay put a giant steak knife right in front of my son! Hello!!!! Moron!    Hope the steakhouse smartens up and hires more appropriate staff!",

I had the crab Oscar topping, which only added to the taste treat. They only small downside was the noise level in the dining area was a bit louder than we expected. But, overall a 5 star experience.",

But it was the service that set this establishment apart from the rest. Our server Hector must have been telepathic because he and his team anticipated our group of 8s every need, down to calling for and escorting us to waiting cabs.  And i can't forget to mention Noah the Bartender, the alchemist behind those Martinis with ice crystals. He set the tone for the friendly atmosphere and was part showman as he prepared our \"poison\".  There was Sinatra crooning in the background and a fine dark wood paneled ambiance. Not to be missed downtown. Take a chance and leave the Strip. You won't be sorry. Best recent meal in a flurry of fine dining.  They also handled a special order birthday cake with aplomb for one of our party.",

Service was great which I tried the waiter's recommendation of the pear martini to start the night off.  I will definitely go again next time I'm in Vegas.  I tried this place based on all the Yelp reviews.  Thank you all for posting such wonderful reviews and pictures.  My bf and I ate so much.  We started off with baked and fresh oysters.  The most tender cut of filet mignon I have ever had, along with the lobster tailed, served with mashed potatoes.  And for desert..... YUMMMM, the bread pudding.  This dinner was worth the price!",

The atmosphere was old school, the staff super professional and the overall vibe unpretentious and classy without being stuffy.  We ordered the heirloom salad which was the only thing we didn't love. We thought the vinaigrette was a little off - kind of tasted like creamy Italian or something. Not our favorite but I still wanted to give it 5 stars because I think that small shortcoming was trumped by a really impressive overall experience. We also had a couple of amazing Moscow Mules and for our entree we had filets, which were perfect, and delicious along with a baked potato - which was huge and more than enough for two, and asparagus. The cherry on top came in the form of a traditional and HUGE piece of NY style cheesecake with strawberry sauce. It was so big we had to take half to go. Our total check for dinner and 4 cocktails was $200 and worth every penny!  We are still talking about this place days later - always a good sign - and will be back asap!",

Our waiter Jay was very vague and made no menu suggestions but of course people stereotype their table. He was energetic and talkative to his other tables. I ordered filet mignon...it was very bland. We usually go to Ruth Chris in Vegas... much better dining experience for what you pay. I ordered a bake potato and a side of broccoli. They didn't even cut the broccoli up. The potato was nothing special. I've had better potatoes at chains like Outback. This was just ridiculous overall. Perhaps we ordered the wrong thing but when you get a nonchalant waiter, it affects your dining experience overall.",

We were a party of 5, Reservations made, seated promptly, waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged by the wait staff. Little things regarding the service were noticed such as unfilled water glasses and the lack of removing dirty dishes (the empty appetizer dishes were still on the table when the main course arrived) plus the cocktail service was painstakingly slow. I felt the waiter had too many tables and not enough time. From start to finish our meal was 3 hours...not hateful but to us was a bit long.....  In summary the food was excellent as expected, the service was lacking enough to detract from the dining experience. I would personally recommend Delmonico's Steak House at the Venetian for the better overall experience at this dining level.",

The ambiance and music gave a very old school speak easy vibe, which I loved. It was a tiny bit too dark inside which can make it difficult to read the menu. I saw various people using the light in their cell phone to view it. The service was fantastic and the food was tasty. I had the ribeye steak which was cooked to perfection. I also had the au gratin potatoes which were also amazing! The only part of the meal I wasn't impressed with was the spinach. It would of been good had it not been drenched in salt. It was pretty much inedible due to the amount of salt. Regardless, I think that could of absolutely been a one off situation and it wouldn't keep me from visiting again. They had a large menu and there's so much I'd still like to try. Check this place out, you won't regret it! Highly recommend!!",

The service was excellent, but I felt like the food was lacking. We started with oysters on the half shell and they were tiny. Each was probably the size of a dime. Both of us decided to order the special which was an 8 oz filet, 5 oz lobster tail, green beans and fingerling potatoes. My main disappointment was in temperature. Everything on the plate was lukewarm at best. Steak was topped with chopped garlic, not garlic butter as advertised. Finished it off with cheesecake which was good. The entire meal was $250+ and left me feeling unsatisfied. Doubt I will be back with so many better options.",

Sure, they are pricey ($42 each plus $14 for the \"Oscar\" style) but pretty much all food in Vegas is expensive. You'll likely forget your $25 breakfast, but you'll definitely remember the steak at Vic & Anthony's.   We ordered some wine and other drinks with our meals, and had creme brulee for dessert. It was a bit of an odd presentation, served on a plate instead of a bowl, but that allowed for maximum bruleed surface area lol. It's a good thing we were sharing - that's way too much sugar for one person. I prefer a deeper dish, but that's a personal preference. Still had a great flavour and texture. Excellent service, great food - overall a wonderful evening with great people.",

We had to turn on the flashlight on my phone just to see the menu (had 2 other tables doing the same) this place was a little too dark. My wife had the filet mignon, which was so-so. My father-in law had the filet mignon with lobster tail, he said it wasn't bad. My son had the salmon, which he said had a weird tasting seasoning on it, he didn't like it. And I had the prime ribeye cooked medium, but when it came it was more like well done...dry, hard. I didn't return it because I felt it was rude, so I just settled for it and pretended it was good when the waiter asked. Also, everything is ala-carte, nothing comes as a meal...you know with soup or salad, potato or rice, etc. So the bill keeps getting higher and higher just to get a side dish. The baked potato was huge though, the waiter joked around and said that was only half of the potato and he's bringing the other half...haha. so they highlight the potato being so big, so what. The place is WAY over priced. I don't mind the prices, it's the whole package I didn't like",

We finished our meal with the Elvis dessert (ok) and the mint chocolate pie (I have the name wrong but it's the first time on the dessert menu; it was like eating a Thin Mint cookie - yummy!)

    "text": "First, let me start by saying I don't give 5 stars easily, and this place deserved every single one. Vic & Anthony's delivered the perfect atmosphere, exceptional service, and  an incredible culinary experience. The atmosphere is very dim and perfect for a romantic night. Victor was our server and he delivered flawless service. I've been in food and beverage for 9 years and have worked at some of the top steakhouses and restaurants on the strip and I was very impressed by him. If I had my own restaurant, I would want him on my team- My compliments to the restaurant for finding him! He was extremely knowledgable on the wine list, recommending the perfect wine pairings for our meal and even brought tastings to ensure we would be happy with our choice. Now for the food:  To start we got the infamous crab cake (I don't even like crab) and every bite was delicious. You have to try this!!   Pear & saga salad- I was skeptical about ordering but I'm so glad victor recommended it. The BEST salad I have ever had. Everything about this salad flowed and it was perfectly proportioned. I could go on and on but do yourself the favor and get this!  For entrees I got the 8 oz filet with a side of peppercorn (loved the peppercorn but the steak was cooked so nicely and was full of flavor so it didn't even need it) and my date got the American Kobe filet special that came with lobster. Also got a side of macaroni & cheese which was good but very rich (what Mac & cheese isn't?)  For dessert- OMG CROISSANT BREAD PUDDING. To die for. I was already in a food coma from the appetizers and main course but this was so amazing I finished it. Thank you chef!  All in all, out of all the restaurants I've tried, this is definitely one of the best culinary experiences I've had. I underestimated it, being located in the Golden Nugget and all, but wow- I was mistaken. Definitely don't come here unless you've got the money to spend. Our bill was $240 for 2 people but worth every penny.",

Filet was absolutely melt in your mouth and the Rib Eye was full of delicious flavor.    Lobster mac n cheese was amazing as well with huge chunks of lobster and cheesy goodness.    Victor also recommended the Croissant Bread Pudding for dessert which was pretty good but the Key Lime Pie was fantastic!  All 6 of us were completely satisfied and thoroughly enjoyed our meal/experience at Vic & Anthonys!",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place, but there were several things that kept it from getting 5 stars.  1. The restaurant is DARK. You'll notice many of the photos are either filtered or have flash.   2. Our party ordered a steak medium, but it came out rare. I even had to toss some bits out that looked absolutely raw. The other filet mignon was ordered medium rare and came out perfect.  3. There's a television+bar that the entire table area can see. I'm usually a fan of TV to watch a game, but not at a steakhouse. It was distracting, especially at the darker venue.  Beyond those things however, the service was great, the sides were good and plentiful, and the cheesecake was huge and delicious.",

Also there were burnt parts of the ribeye that surprised me -the party I was with were not impressed either and the consensus was we have had better -Vancouver oysters were my favorite part of the night.

We recently took our 22 year old son for a special dinner for his graduation.  We ordered the seafood tower, it was great! Rock lobster, king crab, shrimp, oysters and the (in my Oprah voice) the seafood martini! It's very pricy (175ish) but worth every penny.  I noticed they had a \"Distinctive Dining Deal\" it's a 3 course meal that's under $55ish per person, and great selections. Must try, I suggest dress up a little, but I did see people in shorts. Nice place to celebrate a special occasion!",

    "text": "Having eaten in their Atlantic City Location and given it top reviews, we very much looked forward to our dining experience here in Vegas our here on our annual Golf trip with 8 Hard core restaurant Gentlemen who are very much a difficult bunch to please.  So we roll downtown into old Las Vegas where we normally dine next door at Hugo's Cellar but thought we would give this place a try.   Arrive to bustling place heart in the Golden Nugget where our party of 8 is seated immediately at a nice round table.  Service is brisk where OK bread is provided as we peruse a fairly overpriced wine list and a similar menu as its NJ counterpart.   Everything is Ala Carte and pricey as a top steakhouse is but if they deliver you don't mind   After selecting some wine we are off to the races.   Wedge Salads with Blue Cheese \"Homemade\" dressing is truly outstanding with a rich Roquefort cheese chunked in.    The Shrimp Cocktail were large fresh and cold but the cocktail sauce in short was extremely disappointing.   Cesar salads were OK nothing special.   Entrees:   Veal Chops Absolute perfection, grilled and charred to proper temperature and as tasty as they come.   The Rib Eye's were in short OK but not as good as the Veal Chops.   I'm not a filet Mignon person and this large piece of prime beef did nothing to change my mind as it simply has no flavor. This is a personal preference.   The NY Strip was top notch.   Sides were good but not great as baked potato was a disappointment while the mushrooms were excellent as was the creamed corn.   Service was 100% outstanding all night.   All and all a bit pricey, gratuity of 20% already added on so no problem there, but I've had better steakhouse experiences for the price points, and I certainly think they A.C. Please is much better.   Good but not great is the only way to describe the experience.",

My husband and I got the filet mignon cooked perfectly medium rare. I got the port peppercorn sauce which was so tasty. The sides were so freaks and delicious and HUGE! Easily could be share 3-4 ways. We got the broccoli, potatoes au gratin, and the creamed spinach. We were so full by the end of our meal and wish we could have eaten it all.

They are not lying when they say jumbo lump and they are not stingy with it.  Barely any breadcrumbs which is what crab cake should be like.

There is a strong  taste of cognac.  Sea bass a la nage: the best fish dish I have ever had.  This is how all fish should taste.  It was heavenly and not only that they sprinkle it with jumbo lump crab!  Prime ribeye: cooked to perfection.  Au gratin potatoes: simply delicious!  I really liked the cheese it was baked with.

    "text": "It deserves the Michelin star and 4 stars from me because they do something a lot of places, with fine meat, don't-- they cook it perfectly. This isn't a tucked away bargain on Freemont, its a destination restaurant. A great guy's place for that one \"big meal\".  It's not in a league or price range, with Crafsteak, but it could very well be the best steak you eat all year.  Yeah, the service was an issue. They were friendly but they delivered our entrees one at a time, while the rest of us were still working on our appetizers.    The apps were fantastic-- here's what I say: They have the best crab cakes on the strip,  topped with a sweet and tangy chive sauce, bold but complimentary to the pure and rich crab. Sensational  The sirrachi quail was ordered as a lark--  I've always wanted to bbq with \"the rooster sauce\" but, now I actually \"get\" why they have the rooster on the bottle-- it works with bird amazingly well.  The quail was delicate, juicy and a bit gamey, but the sirrachi glaze was such a strong contrast that every bite was an experience. Excellence!   The freshwater oysters were also a hit, they were in fantastic condition, and with a little rock salt sprinkled over them and some seriously coarse pepper, delicious. We also tried the shrimp cocktail which came with about #4 shrimp, huge babies! The sauce was a compote of cherry tomato, chunky garlic pieces, that beautiful coarse black pepper and some sherry. There was a hint of the sarachi in this as well. This is one of the best shrimp cocktails I have ever tried, and it was in my opinion, a value. If a couple were splitting this, it would work as a first course for sure.  Now to the steak. I ordered a bone-in rib eye, others in my party also ordered the fillet, the stuffed sea bass (amazing) the stuffed salmon (creative and maybe the standout) the lamb rack (4 to a rack) and of course there's always one...he ordered the chicken.   My steak ordered Medium rare was cooked to perfection, lightly seasoned, every bite was juicy and had that tangy-tease on first bite, followed by the deep beef flavor. Magnificent!    And rib eye lovers take note, the meat near the bone was intense, a True sign of proper aging.  It was delicious and I left nothing but the bone.  I tried the stuffed salmon, which was filled with gouda and onion compote, and flakes of fresh herb, it was sensational-- I believe it was cooked on some sort of exotic wood because it had a unique flavor. This is the best salmon I have ever tasted. The cheese, the herbs, and the wood flavor only made the flesh of the perfectly cooked fish blow up, it was raining slamon flavor in my mouth, with dimensions I can't explain-- I want to go back and have this dish!    The sides were of course above average. You don't get a Michelin star for slacking in detail, but I am tired of baby veg, and chunky mash potatoes. but they were very very good. The onion strings, and asparagus (cooked with truffle oil) were fantastic. Also, I really liked the wedge salad. It was huge of course, but the cheese and two types of bacon, house dressing really was impressive, I mean its as if this great sounding salad we've all ordered before came to new life. It's perfected here.   Parking: work with the people at the Nugget and you'll have less of a walk.  Service: Knowledgeable, and very friendly, good reccomendations without seeming like they are up-selling. Above average. Young table runners though seem a bit out of whack. Wine service is a True value here.  Highly Recommended  Per person with wine, drink, app, salad and entree about $95 with tax. Per glass wine service is generous and reasonable, and they are known for heavy pours.  Clean restrooms, and old school decor. Men should wear a \"going out shirt\" gals dress up here, but there's plenty of clientele going casual on the night I was there, so I can't say any dress code is firm. I'd call.",

This place rivals most of the fine dining places on the strip and the pricing is actually very reasonable for the caliber of food. The portions are very large and the service is very fast and friendly. The atmosphere is dark and very intimate though there are spots in the middle perfect for casual dining, if you take your significant other then make sure you get a table along the walls of the place for an even nicer experience.  I would recommend a good cut of steak, the veal or the big 25 oz rib eye is the way to go. Pair it with a Pinot Noir and the lobster bisque soup. If you are not a meat fan ( you really shouldnt go to this place then ) but seriously if you just are not feeling steak then i would definitely get the jumbo shrimp and crab cakes.  I would definitely recommend this place, it is also a great last minute nice place to eat just in case you forgot to make plans or need a place to impress with little or no time advance or reservations.",

I was tired and want a steakhouse and did not want to leave the hotel.  It ambiance is traditional steakhouse along the Morton's line . . . Morton's has always been a place I loved to go when on the road too long but that is another story . . . centered on familiarity.  And so it is with Vic and Anthony's.  I started with a Booker and suggested that an associate try one.  I thought South Africans could drink . . . well now I have two.  I had a beefsteak tomato salad, excellent, and followed it up with a ribeye and some creamed spinach.  Next time I will upgraded to the bone in ribeye.  The quality of the steak was Prime and it sang out its quality on the first bite.  The creamed spinach was spot on.  Stag's Leap bottles were 1/2 off on selected bottles.  I had some with dinner.  Finished with a espresso.    In summary, I would have not searched it out.  But is a very good steakhouse and hits all the right notes.  So why then only 4 starts . . . now this could be really pissy but the service was over attentive . . . there is a fine balance when serving between attentive and annoying.  To be fair, I would have given them 4 1/2 stars, maybe even 4 3/4 stars, but I just can't give them a 5 star review.  I know I am a bastard . . . but in the end it comes down to the fact that I would return only  if it was convenient but I would not search this excellent restaurant out.  Instead I would be more adventurous.",

    "text": "My husband and I dined here on our recent trip to Vegas after reading about it on Trip Advisor and we're so glad we did! Even though we were staying at the NY, NY on the Strip, we ventured into the old part of town for this meal at the Golden Nugget. After the $30 cab ride, we kept our fingers crossed that the meal was as great as we'd read about and were not disappointed.  Ambience: The restaurant exudes that traditional steak house feeling! The dark wood, leather, and dim lighting made it the perfect environment to enjoy a lovely meal.  They even had very beautiful stained glass ceiling pieces in the area where we were seated that were unlike anything I'd ever seen. The restaurant was busy, but the tables were nicely spaced and my husband and I never felt as though we were being invaded upon by other guests. There was even a large table nearby, but again no issues!  Food: We decided to enjoy our bread and butter and also a cup of their lobster bisque which was perfect. Off to a great start! We also ordered two reasonably priced glasses of merlot (recommended by our waiter, Mario) from Washington State.  It was so tasty that we bought a bottle upon our return home and have bookmarked the winery (Sagelands) in our favorites. My husband ordered the rib eye (rare) and I ordered the filet (medium). These steaks have to be among the very best we've ever had, and we've dined at several of the finer steakhouses in the US.  The meat was seasoned perfectly, and so juicy that we savored every bite until the end. We chose the asparagus spears as our veggie to share, and they too were wonderfully seasoned (huge stalks, by the way!) We did look the dessert menu over, and there were many choices that looked appealing but we passed.   Service: As others have mentioned, the service was top notch. Our waiter, Mario was friendly, knowledgeable, and visited our table just the right amount of times during our meal. We were so impressed by the quality of his service that we asked to speak to the manager on our way out to share our compliments. Needless to say the manager was concerned at first that something had gone awry with our meal, but was very happy that our first experience had been so positive.  Bottom line: While expensive, Vic and Anthony's triumphs over the typical Vegas steak. Make the trip! I know the next time we are in Vegas; we will definitely stop in for a repeat performance.",

    "text": "If you happen to be in downtown Las Vegas and find yourself hungry for some of the best steaks in the country, I highly recommend Vic and Anthony's steakhouse.  The food was what you would expect for a top notch steakhouse... the best.  For starters, their lobster bisque and seafood chowders were wonderful.  The pear and blue cheese salad was very good and was large enough to be a meal in itself.  Now to the heart of it all.  The 18 oz. Australian rock lobster tail was amazing.  The meat was sweet and crunchy, but not chewy.  It was so good, I've ordered it twice (and I'm not much of a lobster eater).  The steaks here are some of the best anywhere.  The 24 oz. bone-in ribeye and 18 oz strip were both juicy and flavorful.  The extra marbling really gave these cuts quite a lot of flavor.  Also, everything was cooked as ordered.  It is also worth saving some room for dessert.  The bread pudding here is excellent and comes with a scoop of ice cream.  It goes well with a cup of espresso.   Service here is excellent.  Servers are both very knowledgeable about every dish and wine selection on the menu, and may even make a suggestion for something that is not on the menu.  They are also very amenable to splitting orders into smaller portions (we had our lobster tail cut into medallions) since the portions are quite large.  Everything arrived as expected and any requests were handled promptly.  The only warning I would give is that every dish here comes in large portions.  You might have to pace yourself to enjoy the full spectrum of what Vic and Anthony's has to offer.",

My only complaint is that the waiter was not friendly, nor unfriendly, he also did not warn us about the size of the side dishes. Our group of 6 ordered 5 and were overwhelmed. We expected better of the waiter. Otherwise it would of been a 5 star. Though, other tables seemed to have had better staff serving them. We will try them again on our next trip to Vegas",

Only downside was we were there for a birthday and they charged us for the birthday dessert they brought us without ordering. Place is classy without being stuffy.  On site wine expert made excellent recommendations and was cost sensitive.",

My wife had the halibut and it was also very fresh tasting and delicious.  Really a very nice treat (it was my birthday, and since I had let them know on the reservation, I got a little chocolate mousse cake, very nice). If you are looking for a special occasion place, I would not hesitate in recommending you consider Vic & Anthony's. .",

    "text": "Choosing Vic & Anthony's over the plethora of other great Vegas steakhouses wasn't easy.  I'm sure many, if not all, of the other options would have been great as well, but we were very pleased with our choice.  The service was absolutely wonderful and the food was amazing (me the filet, her the crab/lobster/filet combo special).  We'll be tempted to try another Vegas steakhouse the next time around for a new experience, but we may well end up back at Vic & Anthony's because it was so great.  Our only complaint (and it's a big one) is that the Golden Nugget valet was full (at 7p) and the parking garage was one of the worst we've ever experienced (long delays, nearly full, expensive (though V&A's validates), with a slow/crappy elevator, and stairwells that lock behind you, preventing you from re-entering the garage!  But since parking isn't the restaurant's fault, we won't ding them for that.",

Appetizer: We ordered the oysters Rockefeller and while I'm not a huge fan of oysters, these were amazing. Really fresh and the sauces to accompany them were perfect.   Dinner: My NY strip steak was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. Worth every single penny. I would suggest splitting the sides though...they're huge and way too much for one person. I asked for a wine pairing and I expected the server to suggest the most expensive one on the list, but it was the second least expensive and went perfect with my steak.   Dessert: I ordered the creme brulee and it was great but, again, enough for two people. Being that I had the Tahitian vanilla bean creme brulee at Le Cirque (Bellagio) the night before, it didn't stand up. Still very yummy though.   Definitely worth the money if you're a steak fan.",

    "text": "Before I get to what a terrific restaurant this is, I have to depart into the bloody mary, my thing:  I expected more from the bloody mary here. Demitri's is my favorite mix, but for a cocktail that pairs so well with meat, I'd have expected a house-made mix. And, \"spicy\" meant extra tabasco, not the right answer in our age of scotch bonnet, bird and ghost peppers.   The soups: fantastic. I ordered one for my dining companion, took a taste, and was so impressed that I immediately ordered their other soup option for myself, to try both.   The large ribeye was delicious and well-cooked, but I have to be straight to my readers about the bone-marrow sauce option. I chose to come here specifically for that sauce, and I can't fault it for being what it is: I just had to learn, somewhere, sometime, that it's a black, salty, sticky sauce with chunks of greyish paste-y marrow.   My dining companion had the salmon, and was relieved that the Roaring Fork's is better. It'd be a shame to have raised the bar on one's favorite entree at such an inaccessible place. The grilled wild mushrooms came in nice variety, three of four types.  Dessert, the flourless chocolate cake, was too rich for words, of course, and fabulous, but if you're reading this in Austin, go to the Mesa Grill in Northwest Hills for its rival.  We went for the old-school atmosphere and the interesting menu, but the service was top-flight, the best waitstaff I've had outside Paris, the kind of service that makes you remember that serving can be one hell of a classy profession.",

    "text": "First tried calling for a reservation for the tasting room (private room).  I'm dinging a star from the review because I had to call multiple times to get everything correct: finally they just gave me the manager's email address and we corresponded that way.  After you visit the restaurant you can see why they have so much trouble: they take the reservations from the front desk, and it's just too loud.  So I was in charge of preparing everything for 10 Japanese executives. Over email with the manager we created a set menu that had everything except dessert already decided.  They did a great job getting everything ready for us.  Our menu was three appetizers (quail, crab cakes, jumbo shrimp).  My guests liked the quail and crab cakes, but the jumbo shrimp was pretty ordinary for them.  I liked the quail.  What I thought would be the most boring part of the meal got the most positive response: the iceberg wedge salad.  The dressing was very good, and they way it's presented makes it appetizing.  Next up was the filet mignon.  I had them cook the steaks medium with only salt and pepper.  Vic&Anthony's has a lot of options for sauces, but I think simple is always best with great meat.  I met with Brian who manages all of the wine and explained the budget ($50 per person for initial drinks: beyond that each person must pay their own way).  This is a typical way Japanese groups handle these outings, because it gives some slack on what drink choices are available.  Brian suggested a magnum bottle of a good cabernet sauvignon, which hadn't even occurred to me.  It really impressed my guests because you don't see magnum bottles in restaurants very often in Japan.  We ran out of wine just before they served the steak, so I went in half with one of our younger guests for a standard sized bottle of wine.  I wanted to get an idea of the wine markup, so I asked for a bottle of something I knew they would have.  Based on the price they quoted me, expect to pay between 2~3 times winery prices, which is a little on the high side for restaurants, but they brought out the decanter as well, so factoring in everything involved I can understand the higher prices.  On the tasting room: it's private but not closed off from the rest of the restaurant.  Think of it like a VIP room in a club and that should give you a good idea.  The service charge was included in the bill (20%), and if you pay with a credit card they'll ask to see some ID.",

    "text": "EXCELLENT.  I know there are a ton of options for fine dining in Vegas, but Vic and Anthony's was really exceptional for a number of reasons.   FOOD: I came here with a group of 7 and 5 of us ordered from the $50pp 3 course prix fixe menu, which boasted some great options. I opted for the lobster bisque for the first course, fresh fish a la nage for the second, and creme brulee for the third. The lobster bisque was HEAVENLY. It was rich, butter, and full of lobster meat. The fish (it was salmon) was served with delicious sauteed carrots, haricots verts and zucchini and was topped with crab meat. Very tasty. The creme brulee...... I had a bit of a spiritual moment with that dessert. It was served in a large, flat dish so there was a lot of crispy, delightful caramelization to break with a spoon. Beneath the crunch top was an absolutely decadent creme, chock full of vanilla bean. It was so good I actually cried. It was so good I turned down bites of my boyfriend's chocolate mousse cake. It was so good I kept eating it and eating it even though I thought I was going to burst at the end of the second course. I have seriously never eaten a dessert THAT good.   SERVICE: Exceptional. Our waitress was patient and attentive, making sure that we were well taken care of. My glass of water was never left empty. My empty plates and used utensils were taken away at just the right time. Our food was well-timed and we were treated very well.  AMBIANCE: Personally, I think Downtown Vegas (Fremont Street) is about 1000% cooler and hipper than the strip. The Golden Nugget, in which Vic and Anthony's is located, is a classy establishment with a dash of funk and fun from the vibrant promenade outside. The restaurant itself is dimly lit, very classic steakhouse decor with white table clothes and dark finishes. There are candles flickering on every table. Frankly, I would have happily eaten this food on a bus or in a cab or at my aunt's house or anywhere because it was so good it wouldn't have mattered, but the ambiance and feel of this restaurant really amplified the experience.   Overall, superb restaurant. Go if you have the chance!!",

We have dined at 3 starred Michelin restaurants, and we have NEVER EVER seen an unholy markup on wine as we did at this restaurant. In fact, the table next to us were saying the same thing. They were in total disbelief. Of course, there is significant mark up at restaurants for wine, but this was just plain insulting.  My husband got the $155 steak which was a rare beef and that was great. I got the prime bone in rib eye, and was severely disappointed. I get bone in ribeye regularly (it's my cut) at Fleming's, Mastro's, Ruths Chris and other high end prime steakhouses, and the bone is always long and runs across the steak. Here, it was a \"bone\" that was barely an inch! How is that possible? It just didn't look right or taste right--it lacked seasoning, and it was 3/4 fat. Rib eye is a fatty cut of meat, but I get it regularly and never experienced this much fat.  The sides were disappointing other than the mushrooms. Brussel sprouts lacked seasoning, duck fat potatoes would have been superb, but some pieces were not fully cooked. Au gratin potatoes were okay, but the consistency of the cheese was like Velveeta. I prefer a firmer cheese with a crunch at the bubbling top. Also, the creamed corn was salty. Weird.  Our bill came to about $550. Not worth it. Our server Luciano was spectacular, or I would have given it a much lower rating.",

The steaks melt in your mouth, you don't even need to cut them with a knife, they are cooked to perfection. Writing this review 4 days later is making my stomach rumble and mouth water. This is fine dining, and yes it is very pricey but reasonable for what you get. The waiter warned us that the sides are meant to be shared, we ordered broccoli and wild mushrooms...... they were fabulously cooked, and seasoned perfectly. I would not change a thing. Yes, the steak is a piece of meat that comes on the plate, by itself. It does not need to be garnished, it is perfect by itself, it is rich and flavorful. All these low ratings for it being expensive.. HELLO it's a steak house, mind you a FINE DINING steak house, go to outback plebeian if you want to complain about the cost of your steak vs quantity/quality.  Also the low ratings about garnishing, again HELLO steak house,  you're getting a steak or meat... it's not coming with anything unless you ask for it. Also if clearly states on the menu upgrades for  sauces on your steak will cost you, so people complaining about hidden fees/cost, learn to read. Honestly, I'm 28 years old and I understand how to read a menu and how to punch in numbers on my cellphone and decide whether I can afford to eat some where.   If you're looking for a seriously nice dinner that you'll remember, come here. And please at least dress nicely. Nothing ruins ambiance like jerks who wander in with jeans and a T shirt.",

    "text": "This place is THE place to eat if you are at Freemont Street!  My sister had her wedding at The Golden Nugget so she had her reception dinner here. There were about 30 of us and they had no problem accommodating us in the back corner of the restaurant. Everything about this place was good.   The service: Our waiter was Matt. He was THE DUDE to have. He knew everything there was to know about the wine, beer, food and specials. He was courteous, fun, attentive and cute.  The food: The food was outstanding. Our appetizers were crab cakes, calamari, beefsteak tomatoes and cheese, crab legs and bread. The crab cakes were to die for, they will spoil you forever for crab cakes anywhere else. The steaks were cooked to perfection, the seafood (I had the salmon) was excellent and the salads/soups were a good round up on the entrees. Their side were said to have been good, I only had the mashed potatoes which were decent.  The drinks: The drink list, wine list and beer list is extremely impressive. We had a double magnum (yes, DOUBLE MAGNUM) of Prisoner that served the entire party no problem. The beer was exclusive, you don't find what they had on their menu anywhere else very often. The bourbon my husband had was 180 proof, crazy!  All in all a great experience. I would definitely come back here again!",

    "text": "Amazing experience! I thought I was dreaming the entire time   Staff was friendly and attentive. They did not miss a beat and were not overbearing.   Our table started with the calamari and oysters. We each then got either a salad or soup before our sizzling plates of deliciousness greeted us. It took one bite to know I was hooked! I ordered the filet and it was cooked to perfection. We paired this with a nice Pinot noir.   In case we didn't have enough we ordered the bread pudding. Even though we were all plenty stuffed , we were able to find room for this decadent treat!",

The service here was excellent and the food was beyond what I had expected. The \"sides\" were generously portioned (we ordered the wild mushrooms and broccoli and had left overs). Steaks were flawless, like melts in your mouth flawless. We will definitely be visiting Vic & Anthony's again if we make it out here to Vegas.",

    "text": "I just had my wedding dinner here, and it was amazing.  Three weeks before my wedding, my original venue tried to up their prices, so I went seeking an alternative.  Vic & Anthony's was more than accommodating.  While their private room could not fit our group of 26, they made sure to place us in a somewhat cloistered area at 3 large tables.  The service was amazing.  The lead waiter was constantly checking with me, my husband, my father, and my father-in-law to ensure that everything was to our satisfaction.  Even though we had a large group, the kitchen and servers managed to get each course out to the entire group at the same time.  When it came time to cut the cake, the lead waiter brought it out for a very nice presentation, then took it back to be cut.  The restaurant gave us no problem for bringing in our own desert, and only charged a small cake cutting fee (which is pretty standard).  The food was some of the best I've ever had, and I am a real foodie.  The restaurant allowed my guests to order off of the standard menu which was really nice since so many places require a large group to have a smaller set menu.  The crab cakes were the best I had ever had.  Everyone who ordered steak really enjoyed it, and my in-laws said it was the best steak they had ever had.  Thank you to everyone at Vic & Anthony's who made my wedding dinner an amazing event.  It was well worth the cost!",

    "text": "I just got back from one of my best steak dinners ever.  When I arrived, I was seated on a great table close to the bar where I can sit on one of their cool leather chairs and watch the NFL Draft at the same time.  The decor is totally awesome, a cross between the Capital Grille and Craftsteak.  It is furnished like an old school steakhouse with deep rich cherry woods and leather chairs but with beautiful trendy stained glass ceilings and low mood lighting....very sexy.  I love this type of steakhouse....truly a Frank Sinatra hangout with Suits, Steaks, Whiskey and Cigars.  My meal began with their delicious warm sourdough bread and their incredible lobster bisque.  The bisque was super creamy and spicy....one of the best that I have ever had.  For dinner, I ordered a bone-in rib eye steak and a side of sea salt fries. The steak was super tender and juicy with the right amount of marbling. The fries was a perfect side with the great steak.  For desert, I had their famous croissant bread pudding with ice cream and a toffee stick.....super sweet and good.  Vic and Anthony's is one of the best steak houses that I have been to in the U.S.  The decor and ambience is sexy and romantic.......the service is outstanding.  I felt like a celebrity......the hostess and waitress made me feel as if i was the only customer in  the restauarnt.  The Mgr. came by my table a couple of times to check on me and when I left, they comped my desert and gave me a complimentary glass of cabernet franc to finish my meal.  I came in my pants twice.......it was that good.  No sex needed for a week....I am so satisfied!  I can see why they are a Michelin rated steakhouse and was voted as one of top 10 steakhouses in the country.  I wish there was a V@A in California and NY!",

    "text": "I've read a lot of good reviews about this place before I even decided to step in. So, my expectation is very high. Walking into this place on a thursday evening is a fairly easy. But its very very busy in there.  I am a little dissapointed that we dont get to seat in the side seats somewhere instead of being seated in the middle of the dining room. But let me tell you that the experience is that great. I cant never drink my water glass till its empty.  Its always full somehow. I think they have ten servers assistant who just walk around filling up water. Their server assistant are wearing chef uniform to make the whole place looks very classy and elegant.   They even take the time to bring black napkin to my fiance's black dress so that it match her outfit. All I can say is, this place rocks.  Alright, lets get on to the food. We try the lobster bisque for $9.95 absolutely worth it. Have lots of lobster in it and taste very seafoody.   Next, the appetisers, we try the maple glazed quail thats to die for. The maple glazed on the quail is so damn good, we wouldve swallow the quail bone if its not because the head saying dont swallow it.  We ordered a couple of fillet mignon and prime rib eye thats to die for with peppercorn sauce. Keep in mind that everything is not free.   Peppercorn sauce additional $2.95 and sides like mashed potatoes are $6.95. I dont mind paying but some yelper might find it helpful that I write down some prices.  The fillet mignon cost $38 something and its absolutely worth it. My rib eye cost $45 and its HUGE!!! I cant finish it and lemme tell you something, I can eat some steak!!!   All in all, its a great experience and we definetely put it up there as one of the best steak we ever ate and our server BEN is really great and on the ball as well as fully knowledge in his craft!!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I had been planning a trip to Las Vegas for quite some time and finally the day arrived where we were in our car and driving through the desert. I can be classified as a meticulous planner. I had everything planned from what shows we were going to see, to where we were going to stay to where we were going to eat. My girlfriend and I are HUGE fans of Steakhouses and I knew Vic & Anthony's happened to be in the lobby of the Hotel we were staying at the 'Golden Nugget.' I figured since we were driving around it only made sense to enjoy a dinner close to our Hotel this just happened to be in our Hotel. Quite honestly even if this Steakhouse was the other side of town we would of driven there, it is that good.   I made our reservation for Vic & Anthony's using the Yelp feature on my phone. We arrived and from the moment we checked in with the receptionist we were treated like absolute royalty. I due honestly believe we were given the 'STAR' treatment because of the whole 'Yelp' reservation.   As other patrons were being seated on the 1st floor of the restaurant we were taken to a small 2nd level that overlooked the entire restaurant almost like you were on a balcony with curtains obstructing the view of the commoners below you=) As described on the Vic & Anthony's website 'Our Las Vegas locations offers a Private Tasting Room in an elegant setting, featuring beautiful wine country murals. The tasting room will seat up to 18 guests, and features our award-winning cuisine with and extensive wine list.' We were the only ones seated in section until just before our dessert arrived. We were also dressed the part which added with the 'Yelp' check-in was the icing on the cake. The decor was stunning. The chairs we sat in were leather with 'brass tacks,' the menus were hard/thick leather. The music playing was everything 'Old School' Las Vegas offers you, it was a medley of Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and various other artists from the day. You honestly felt like you had been transported back to the 1950's, you were literally looking at the front door of the restaurant want for Bugsy Siegel or Al Capone to walk in the front door.   From the moment we sat down we were treated great by the staff. If you asked for anything they were on the ball and it was done. The staff brought out fresh bread with whipped butter and hard butter upon request. Our waiter 'Hector' arrived soon after our bread did and 'Hector' was one incredible waiter/server. Hector had us laughing, smiling and made our night so much more special than it already was. I am not a drinker at all and nor is my girlfriend but we will enjoy a glass of wine every now and then. We immediately asked 'Hector' what wine pairing would go great with a Filet Mignon, Hector quickly suggested 2006 Rutherford Hill Winery Napa Valley which was amazing. As I stated above I do not see what all the hub-bub is about wine and how is pairs with a meal until this glass of wine and this meal. The wine 'Hector' suggested was fantastic. It was so good (and by 'GOOD' I mean 'GREAT' and by 'GREAT' I mean 'AMAZING.') that several days after we left Las Vegas I actually called the restaurant to get the name of the wine we drank so we could purchase it on our own.   My girlfriend and I were debating if we were going to split a Cesar Salad or also order Tomato & Mozzarella as an appetizer. We asked 'Hector' who asked what we were planning on having for dinner. We told him and he suggested we go with something lighter, we ended up just splitting a Cesar Salad 'Good call Hector.' For an entree my girlfriend and I both ordered the 8oz Filet Mignon, my girlfriend ordered hers Medium rare, I ordered mine Medium. All of the side dishes are A' la Carte. My girlfriend and I decided to go with the Wild Mushrooms & Sea Salt French fries.   Our meal was fantastic; you could literally cut through your piece of meat with a spoon if you wanted to. The steak was cooked to perfection. The edges of the steak had a char to it that complimented the Filet so well. I have been to several top end Steakhouses and nothing even comes close to Vic & Anthony's, I mean they are not even close to being in the same Ballpark.   Right when my girlfriend and I thought we could not eat another bite of food 'Hector' brought the dessert menu and we decided to split a piece of cheesecake. Be advised one piece of cheesecake can easily be split between 2-3 people, so do not eat with your eyes here, order 1 piece=) We ordered out cheesecake with the blueberry dressing on the side and it was simply mind boggling it was so good.   There are several other Steakhouses I want to try in Las Vegas but it is so hard to give them a shot when you know you are going to get such great service and such good quality of food at Vic & Anthony's. I am counting the day's until I can come back here and have another meal.   My girlfriend and I wanted to thank 'Hector' and the entire staff for making our meal such a special one.",

Ambiance is very welcoming for a original las vegas hotel. We always have crab cakes, unreal chop salad, filet migion with recomended wine parings. Please try sanbucco as after dinner drink. You'll fall in love as we have. As of today over 9 visits and looking forward to the next one.",

    "text": "Located inside the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino in the Downtown area is Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse. Classy w/  \"Old Vegas\" ambiance and style.  To call this a \"Steakhouse\" is a disservice. This restaurant is flawless fine dining. From the food, to the service to the fine details everything here is perfection.  My wife and I dined here on our recent trip to Vegas and had the absolute best meal I've ever experienced in the more than 14 years that we've been coming to Vegas regularly. Every course was perfect. Honestly, we didn't even have reservations upon arrival at 6 pm and actually were somewhat under dressed upon entering but the hostess was kind and graciuosly seated us almost immediately.  Our meal:  Appetizers:  Soup of the Day: Chicken Tortilla - Rich and smoky w/ fresh grilled corn, cotija cheese & fresh toasted tortilla strips. It was the perfect balance of  layered spice, crunch and smoothness.  Spinach Salad - Seriously the best sald I've EVER had!  Warm, fresh leaf spinach w/ bacon, chopped eggs, kalamata olives & artichoke hearts served w/ a citrus honey vinaigrette. This could have served as the perfect light entree on it's own.  Entrees:  Jumbo Fried Shrimp with Broccoli and Mashed Potatoes - My wifes entree. Classic ingredients done flawlessly. She loved it. Simple,  seasoned and cooked to perfection  Sea Bass A La Nage - My dish and our servers suggestion.  Chilean Sea Bass poached and topped w/ jumbo lump crab meat and paired with roasted baby vegetables. My favorite course of the night.  Dessert :  Croissant Bread Pudding w/ Caramel Ice Cream - Another of our servers suggestion as a must try dish and It was everything he promised and more. Layers of Croissant stacked, combined and plated into a delicious bread pudding with cinnamon and caramel sauce and paired with a toffee brittle with freshly made caramel ice cream.  The actual plating itself resmbled a swan with a caramel ice cream body with a toffee brittle neck and head perched on a crunchy tuile and balanced with the bread pudding sliced into a triangle alongside.   Overall, a wonderful meal and one we plan on repeating again soon the very next time we're in town. I especially can't wait to enjoy the Spinach Salad, Sea Bass & Bread Pudding time and again.",

    "text": "What can I say that hasn't already been said...maybe that the food is orgasmic? :\")  My new husband and I enjoyed a meal here during our honeymoon.  From the moment we walked in, we were impressed.  The staff is extremely professional and courteous.  The ambience is classy yet relaxed.  One can (and should) dress nicely but we saw many shorts, cargo pants and even a wife beater.  My husband is a big fan of single malt scotch and we were fortunate enough to be served by John who knows more about scotch than anyone we've ever met!   The food was superb...so much so that I moaned throughout the meal! ;)   I enjoyed a perfectly cooked 8 oz. fork-tender filet mignon, pan broiled rock lobster tail and grilled asparagus.  My husband went for straight beef and tackled a perfectly cooked 12 oz bone-in rib-eye.  We shared a side dish of creamed spinach which was topped with seasoned broiled breadcrumbs.  To finish the meal, we shared the homemade cinnamon bread pudding with a scoop of gelato.    Every bite was scrumptious and we were able to enjoy our meal at a leisurely pace. The staff here is helpful but unobtrusive so we were able to enjoy a very romantic time together.  Do not miss this place when you are in downtown Las Vegas!",

    "text": "It is located inside the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino in Downtown Las Vegas. Don't be fooled, its surprisingly very nice for downtown! The atmosphere is extremely classy and although our waiter was super knowledgable and nice, the hostess was not. She didn't smile, and seemed like she didn't want to be there. Also, even though we had reservations, it still took about 20 minutes to get seated and it seemed we got seated at an awkward table right at the entrance.   The steak here was delicious but I do wish they had a smaller sized cut that was not a filet mignon (i like a lot of marbling, something the filet mignon cut does not have). Definitely cooked to the right temperature. Everything you can ask for in a top tier steakhouse. In comparison to Mastro's and Ruth's Chris, I would say the taste is slightly less than par. Don't get me wrong, still delicious but nothing out of this world. With all the steakhouses in Vegas, it wasn't so good that I'll return here again.   Try their crab cake! (Singular, because theres only one). Super chunky crab meat, great flavor and great sauce. If you want to make your visit extra special and different from other steakhouse visits, you must try their crab cake!   I believe our total for 2 was about $150 and we got the crab cake and a side of creamed corn.",

Basically, it was too salty, buttery, and lacked the finesse that such a high-end restaurant should have.  We got a variety of meat and vegetable dishes. The meat was very good. But the vegetable dishes - potatoes au gratin and mushrooms - were very mediocre, too fatty and salty, and lumped in such a big quantity in big dish, slightly unappealing. No elegance.  The deserts were also extremely mediocre. We got the key lime and the chocolate mousse. The key lime had a huge crust... the chocolate mousse didn't taste interesting... it felt basic.  Also, I didn't like the fact that the waiter pushed the most expensive wine first, then the next expensive one... it was a bit obvious.  This is not a place I'd come back to. If the prices were half of what they are, I might, but at this value, it doesn't seem worth it to me. I guess what I'm saying is, it should be priced at half the price it is. That would be fair.",

Anyway... this steakhouse is great! We ordered:   Crabcake appetizer -Yumm, it's basically all crab meat and no filler. Totally great. The crab pieces are gigantic and plump. It comes with a little sauce drizzled on the top with a few chopped tomatoes. Delicious! I wish I could eat some right now. This was probably the best thing I ate.   Filet Mignon -Perfectly cooked medium rare. They're great cuz they verify what medium-rare means to them, so that no one gets something they weren't expecting.   Australian Lobster Tail -Mmm... So many times I have overcooked lobster and it just tastes so gross. But this was so good. Dipped in butter... yumM!! I forgot prepared, but it doesn't matter!   Au Gratin Potatoes -Just cheesy potatoes. I couldn't stop eating it. So good! The potatoes are chopped into little pieces rather than sliced and the cheese is perfectly burnt just a little on top.    We also ordered the most amazing red wine, per recommendation of the waiter. Wow it was so good. It was the first time that I actually saved the cork. Unfortunately, I can't remember what it was (perhaps I drank too much!)   We didn't have time for dessert, but I'm sure it would have been good :) Or if you're here you can skip dessert and then go across the street and get some deep fried oreos to end your night! If you are in downtown LV, definitely stop by Vic & Anthony's!",

The must try is the Creme Brulee.  If you dont mind shelling out the money then you should definitely try this place out",

I basically melted in your mouth! I went ahead and added the Bearnaise Port Peppercorn Beer Onions, which were ok, nothing special though.  I also went with a baked potato and a beer.

I came here with my boyfriend recently, which was our second time dining here & we had a wonderful dinner. The service here is on point. Our server was awesome! I forgot our his name but if I remember it I'll update this review. He was very attentive & friendly. (This review is for our most recent visit here not the first)  Drinks: I ordered the Apple Mule. If you love Crown Apple like I do, you must try it.   Jumbo Lump Crab Cake: Seriously the best crab cake I ever had. No fillers, just huge pieces of crab meat. My boyfriend does not like seafood but it's so good he actually ate it. The sauce & chopped tomato they put on top really completes it.   Roasted Bacon: They give two thick slices of bacon. Sweet, smokey & salty. I usually don't like pork cut thick, but rather thin & crispy. But it's delicious, I would order this again next time.  Tomahawk Steak: First time having a tomahawk & it was delicious. It was perfectly cooked, medium rare just how I like it. Although it was delicious I probably wouldn't order it again. I'll probably just go with a filet or ribeye. Did I mention how huge the bone was? It looked like a dinosaur bone. I really wish I asked the server to pack it so I could've taken it home for my dog lol.  Au Gratin: Super cheesy & very rich. My boyfriend seemed to have enjoyed it more than me.  Brussel Sprouts: I love brussel sprouts, especially when it's cooked with bacon! Some of the brussel sprout leaves were kinda crispy, burnt-ish tasting but I liked them.  Overall our experience here was always wonderful & we will definitely come back again the next time we're in Vegas.",

We ordered the roasted bone marrow, crab cakes, and mushrooms for our appetizers. If you're going to order just one app I wouldn't go with the mushrooms but Omgosh the first two mentioned were to-die-for! There were six of us dining- filet mignon, scallops with porks belly, and the roasted chicken were all a hit. I didn't care for my lobster but that's probably just a personal preference. Cocktails were fantastic! The spiced pear martinis were a hit. Now, for dessert. We ordered two for the table to share. We had the crossaint bread pudding and the chocolate globe, both desserts knocked our socks off and I must say....leave some room an order both. The chocolate globe was such a cool presentation for our wedding guests, they're still talking about it :)",

    "text": "This Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse is located at the Golden Nugget in downtown Las Vegas, Nevada.   Our reservations were for 10:00 PM on a Saturday night, in consideration of the fact that we stayed up all night the night before and did not mind waiting for a table to become available.   We showed up at our reserved time and waited because our table was not yet ready. After several minutes of waiting, we were notified of the availability of our table and followed the hostess in. But we were then turned away, because our table was in fact not ready, forcing all six of us to march our empty stomachs back to the front.   We resumed our wait. After some additional waiting and confirmation that our table was ready, we again made our way into the restaurant and were seated.   After a brief wait, our server appeared and took our orders. The food was on the upper end of decent. The service was also decent, but not to the upside. I could tell that the bussers were anxious, and overtly so (as exhibited by the hasty fashion in which they removed empty plates from the table, including a partially finished appetizer plate--they took it without asking) to boot us out, due to the quickly approaching closing time, all in spite of our patient wait to be seated.  I peg this Vic & Anthony's at a \"dirty\" 3--dirty because Yelp! does not allow me to enter 2.5 stars.",

Our server was Ben, and he was very patient, knowledgeable, and friendly.   Drinks: I had a McCallan 15 on the rocks that was a generous pour. Our boss also bought a bottle of the house Cabernet Sauvignon that was great.   Appetizers: the bacon is awesome. The glaze on it is sweet and smoky. I usually don't like to eat too much thick bacon/pork belly because it's salty, but I could've eaten this all night.  The oysters Rockefeller were very good.   The calamari was crispy and seasoned well. What made it great was the bed of grilled onions and peppers it sat on. They were so flavorful and tender.   Sides: we shared some sides. The mushrooms were charred and tasty.  The creamed spinach was my favorite. The creamed corn was really good. The duck fat potatoes and the Mac and cheese were good, but I wished I had more spinach and corn.  The entrees: I had the 12oz filet with bearnaise and crabmeat on top. The steak was very good. Cooked to my liking and had a good flavor. I didn't care for the bearnaise but others in our group that got it loved it. I just scraped it off and ate the crabmeat, no big deal.   There was an 8oz filet/5oz lobster special that a few people got. They loved it.   The atmosphere was fun. Even though it was fine dining we were still able to enjoy ourselves. It was louder than your normal high end place which we all liked.   Hopefully we'll come back here next year. We had a great experience.",

Service and food were great.  I didn't mind paying the price for a nice dinner, but it is not over priced for the quality of food and service.  Everything was outstanding.  I had the snake river farms ribeye.  It literally melts in your mouth.  If I had a complaint it would have been our table location.  We were sat at the closest table to the bar.  There is a hall wall dividing the bar from the dining area.  Avoid the area if your there for the ambiance.  The TV was on and the glare was a bit distracting.   It definitely took away from the ambiance of the restuarant.  There should not be a television in that atmosphere.  Then as it got busier a customer used the half wall as his leaning post right behind my wife bumping her a few times.  Staff told him to move a couple times, but he never did.  It did not ruin the experience.",

    "text": "I wish I could say this restaurant is as professional as others within the GOLDEN NUGGET Casino & Resort in Las Vegas.  Unfortunately, I don't see this as being an accurate statement.  I made a reservation thru Open Table 7/25 in the early afternoon for the following evening of 7/26.  It was accepted.  I showed up at the Nugget the afternoon of 7/26 and suddenly, my cell phone text stated THE RESTAURANT had arbitrarily canceled my dinner reservation.  As a woman who dines solo (widow) this was most disconcerting.  I therefore made a reservation at the lovely Chart House within (undoubtedly better in ALL respects I discovered...) but returned to V&C's restaurant and inquired, \"what happened\" ???  They took my name and number and a day later, STILL no response as to WHY.  I don't deal well with such poor service and rudeness.   I don't need to.  So I think it's pretty clear I won't be choosing this restaurant in the lovely Golden Nugget in the future, for myself or visiting family and friends.",

It seems the decor has had a nice refresh since our last visit, either that or I was too drunk to remember what the place looked like the first time I was here. It is very dimly lit, but the huge Tiffany-inspired stained glass lamps and dark wood give this place a very many, classic steakhouse vibe. Hector, our server was spectacular and service was prompt. Our water glasses never saw less than half full at any time and our cocktails did not take long to arrive.   The food speaks for itself. I had the very best filet I have ever tasted, which was only made better by the seared foie gras I happily paid extra for. Sides are huge and shareable, but my bacon and garlic enhanced Brussels sprouts made it down my gullet without assistance from the other members of my party. We mentioned that my brother-in-law was celebrating his 40th birthday and he received a lovely birthday dessert.   This certainly has to be the best steakhouse in Vegas. Be prepared to be well served, well fed, and to pay for it.",

They had no restrooms and the place was very cramped. However the trendy NY style decore was somewhat worth it.   Now on the food, had the surf n turf and the portions were tiny, like, one or two bites.   The steak was really aged and didn't taste that great. Seafood was actually decent but portions were tiny and expensive.   Just not worth the price or parking hassle.",

We did not finish with dessert but watched the table beside us as they enjoy the most amazing dessert that opened as a chocolate sauce was poured over it.

    "text": "If you are looking for an inexpensive steak dinner, Vic and Anthony's is not where you should be focusing your attention. That being said, if you are looking for a great steak and are willing to part with a few Andrew Jackson's (or more), then Vic and Anthony's is worth a visit. All of the steaks come ala carte and the side dishes will set you back a few bucks as well.   I opted for the 8 oz. Filet Mignon and Garlic Mashed Potatoes. The steak was cooked to perfection and the potatoes were outstanding. Although the side dishes are a little pricey, the portion size is generous enough to share. I would rate the steak and mashed potatoes as some of the best I've ever had.  They also offer chicken, fish and lobster, but all in our party opted for beef. I will say the Australian Lobster tails on display looked rather tasty though. If you are a salad aficionado, they have you covered there too with eight to choose from on the menu. They have a fairly extensive beverage list, including specialty drinks, wine and bottled beers.   The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was what you would expect from a high class steak house. Located inside the Golden Nugget Casino, the clientele ranged from those in tuxedos and dresses, to others in blue jeans and T-shirts. Typical Vegas tourism in an upscale environment.  My 8 oz. Filet was $41 and the side dishes ranged from $9 - $12. The three of us split two sides, or Accompaniments, as the menu refers to them. We ordered a Crab Cake appetizer (not listed on the menu) at the recommendation of the waiter. It was outstanding, despite the $21 price tag for one four ounce Crab Cake.  For dessert, I went with the Chocolate Mousse. One in the party got the cheesecake, which rivaled any I'd seen before. All total, for the three of us, including a few adult beverages and the tip, we left happy and satisfied, even after dropping just north of $300.  If you are looking for a great meal, in a great atmosphere with outstanding service, and don't mind dropping a few bucks, I would recommend Vic & Anthony's. Their menu is also available on the Golden Nugget website, so you can peruse it before you go.",

A beautifully appointed room in \"Old Vegas\" style, with lots of dark wood and leather.  The hostess was very nice, and seated us immediately.  The drinks were generous, and reasonably priced.  The bread basket was crusty French bread - not terribly innovative, but good.  Our waiter took our order timely.  So far, everything was as expected.  So, we get to the food.  My lobster bisque was good, but not the best I have had.  Ditto the Oysters Rockefeller, which was kind of drenched with Parmesan.  My side of potatoes au gratin was also along the lines of a lot of cheese with some potatoes mixed in.  Not that I mind that, but just know that your dinner is getting to be rich, rich, rich.  Then there was the filet.  It looked right, but the texture was a little bit mealy.  I could still have given five stars, but for the prices which I will get to in a moment.  However, I then asked my wife about her meal.  She said that her tomato salad was kind of ordinary, and her fried lobster mac & cheese was simply not to her taste.  So let's talk prices.  There are many excellent steak houses in Las Vegas, including downtown (Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse, for example) with equally nice ambiance, even better food, and generally lower prices.  That fact would have convinced me not to go back to V&A's, except for one thing - after we had dined I became aware of the little-known \"Distinctive Dining Menu.\"  In order to take advantage of this discounted prix fixe menu, you have to print it out off the web site, and bring it in with you when you arrive.  This menu has a three course dinner, including some fine choices (both my lobster bisque and filet would have been available off of this menu) at a fixed price of $52.  That's a pretty good deal, and I would go back for it.  If I had to order off of the main menu, though, I would go elsewhere.",

For appetizers, my spouse ordered cold shrimp and crab martini while I had the lobster bisque. For dinner he ordered a prime rib steak with asparagus and au gratin potatoes. I had shrimp pasta. We paired all of this with a bottle of white wine.   Sounds crazy that we went $205 on food when we can get this anywhere else for cheaper, but it was the best food so far since we've been here. The service was excellent. Our waiter I believe his name was Mario kept checking in on us, laughed with us, and congratulated us on our engagement.",

Luckily for us, the restaurant is located at the Golden Nugget, where we were staying. We also received a $125 gift certificate for the restaurant after attending a timeshare presentation. It seems like we were destined to dine there!  We were able to make a reservation easily through OpenTable on the Yelp app. As we entered the restaurant, we were awed by the restaurant's display of live lobsters as well as steaks and huge lobster tails. The restaurant itself was dimly lit and had jazz music playing in the background.  The food at Vic & Anthony's was delectable! To start off our meal, we had the seared scallops with crisp apple slaw; the scallops were perfectly seared and paired well with the mouthwatering apple slaw. We also had the pear and saga blue cheese salad; loved the combination of flavors! My boyfriend and I both ordered the filet mignon and shared a side of au gratin potatoes. Both of our steaks were tender and cooked perfectly to our preference. We ended our meal with their vanilla bean creme brulee...yum!  The service at the restaurant was fast, attentive, and accommodating. When we first got there, the hostesses were friendly and they promptly guided us to our table. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu, and even gave us some wine samples to help us choose what we wanted to drink. Our water glasses were never empty, and our completed dishes were taken in a timely manner.  Overall, Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse has tasty food and amazing service!",

You had to leave and go through an extremely smoky casino. Not a big deal for a quick meal - but not a good setting for a business dinner where you're doing a lot of talking.  Food was good / very good. I wasn't thrilled with the recommendation from the waiter and it was just okay for the price.   Worst part - they delayed us on the food order - and then brought out all our food at once! If this happens at Applebee's - no problem - this should not happen at a high end steakhouse. Even worse - the wait staff never took away my plates (salad) and it was saddled next to me for the duration of the meal. 1st class pricing with 3rd class service.  Again - I'm sure you can have a better experience here. I won't be back to enjoy it with you. Too many options in Las Vegas to sit in a dark restaurant with zero ambiance and so-so service and food at high end prices. I have no problem paying for high end food / service - I just have some higher expectations.",

    "text": "We decided to stop in because it was rated the #1 steakhouse in Las Vegas. There is also a Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse back home in NJ in Atlantic City so we decided to try it out. We ordered from a $52 pre fixe menu that they have. They do not put this menu out but after looking at reviews on here, we decided to ask about it and our server was nice enough to print it out for us. The pre fixe menu included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I got the lobster bisque soup as the appetizer which was amazing and my boyfriend got the Caesar salad which also delicious because it tasted so fresh. As an entree, we each got the 8 oz filet mignon. The filet was by far the best we've had out of all the steakhouses I've ever been to. For dessert, I got the bread pudding and my boyfriend got the raspberry toffee cheesecake. I got the bread pudding after our server, Hector, recommended it. It was amazing! It was topped off with a scoop of ice cream as well. The cheesecake was also delicious. Last but not least, the service was incredible. Hector was not only professional, but was also very helpful when it came to recommendations! We will be returning again :)",

The evening manager apologized to us for some network issues they were having that prevented us from paying a portion of our bill with a $150 gift card that we had. He said that he knew we were locals and would like to invite us back to enjoy the place properly in the future. That was several weeks ago and he hasn't called us as he said he would. As far as I can tell, he was simply lying to us because he wanted to make sure he had our phone number available in the event that our gift card didn't have the amount on it that we said it did. Could've been handled much, much better. The relatively small cost of dinner for two, including a credit card on hold for the remaining balance after the gift card was applied, meant more to him than our review to others and the fact that we won't visit the establishment again.",

Compared to other restaurants I have seen in Vegas this one is a bit smaller, which isn't a bad thing because it provided a more intimate/romantic feeling to it. The staff was amazing and on top of everything. The only thing I did not like about this restaurant was the bathroom. It was located outside the restaurant in the casino. Seemed a little out of the way to me.   The Food.  Appetizer 1: Oyster Rockefeller <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vic-and-anthonys-steakhouse-las-vegas-2?filter_by_userid=True&select=gPS8SUN9C0iTjZdP_qVKOQ&userid=to5QXyxyI84QCR9JJMXrSw#R8SdoBWP1QGfsTU_oMhfiw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/vic-...</a> This was my first time trying oyster Rockefeller. It tasted amazing! This was a great way to start our dinner. It also came with half a dozen.

TASTED AMAZING. I think everyone should try this.  Entree 1: 8 oz. Filet Mignon  I ordered this for dinner and added the Jumbo Lump Crab Oscar topping. Wow. It tasted great.   Entree 2: 16 oz. New York Sirloin  My boyfriend ordered this for his entree and he said it was amazing.   Side: Mashed potato  GOOD!  Overall, this restaurant was fantastic and everything tasted amazing. I will 100% recommend this place to all of my friends that go to Vegas :)",

Make sure you make an reservation first because the line is long. Parking can be an issue too. I had to park at palaza casino across street .  The steak was made perfect. Every bite was succulent, and full of flavorite. No need pepper, salt, or steak sauce. Service is very good as well. The bill was 140 for three of us and we didn't order wine.  1 year later, second time is still memorable .",

It was seasoned really well and had great flavor, but a couple more seconds on the flame would have been perfect for me. They have a variety of specialty cocktails. I can't wait to go back!

Located in the Golden Nugget in front of a chocolate shop, you walk in and see their meat display and lobsters, dim lighting, cozy setting with the chairs close but not too close to each other, friendly and quick service, and oh the food. My husband usually only gets one thing when we go to steak restaurants and that is a filet mignon. Lets say he has had quite a number of filets and this place served it just perfectly. The filet was the perfect texture, not rubbery or chewey, melts in your mouth, wonderful color when cut, and does not need any help to boost the flavor because its all there. I had a few bites and it was excellent.  I have never had a sea bass and since they had it on special I went ahead and ventured on in there and ordered their sea bass. I was not disappointed at all. I like my fish a little salty and again this did not need any salt or boost, it was everything I expected and more. Their potato puree is amazing as well. Their bread is great and since it was our anniversary we got a complimentary cake. Layers of chocolate, peanut butter and raspberry. It was a big slice as well and we were already too full to finish it but oh it was delicious as well. Our server was polite and fast.",

We had a promotional dinner special I received via email, it included soup or salad, 1 entree, 1 side and 1 dessert, per person. Turned out to be way too much food...we all ended up waddling away with \"to go\" boxes...but it was well worth it. The sides are enormous, they are meant to be shared so keep that in mind when ordering. For the 7 of us I would say 3 sides would have been sufficient. We had  2 potatoes, 2 creamed corn, 2 broccoli, and 1 order of onion strings. My favorite was the creamed corn (which I would have never ordered on my own)...and the onions strings which went well with my perfectly cooked filet. I also enjoyed the rich lobster bisque...had just the right amount of yummy, chunks of lobster. Delicious! But the real star for my sweet tooth was the creme brulee...it was HUGE! It's served in a shallow, but wide bowl so you had a lot of hard shell to share :). Although the promotion was an excellent deal, I wouldn't order again (way too much food)...That said, I will be returning...very soon.",

The Filet Mignon was some of the best steak i have had-yummy yummy yummy. The tuna was not that great and i barely ate any of it.  Wouldn't recommend it to anyone at all.   Decor is dark and almost feel like you walked into a SpeakEasy. The TV at the bar kind of threw the whole thing off though. Unless there is some big event that everyone wants to watch like the Derby or Super Bowl, it should be turned off. It really detracted from the cool ambiance the restaurant had.  The wine list is extensive and they truly have it all-even Screaming Eagle which is rare to find. If you go, get the Filet Mignon and you will have a fabulous dinner!",

    "text": "Overall an average steakhouse. Steaks were not cooked to order but only slightly off. Not enough to complain to management but enough to complain to your dinning partner. When we ordered a side of lobster tail with the large steak we assumed it was a side. But it was actually the $169 monster tail that we would never have ordered as an add-on. The appetizers and some sides were good but the potatoes au gratin were salt with a side of potato. Place has potential but not enough for me to go back",

    "text": "My mother and I were excited to spend our recent winnings on a great steak dinner and Vic & Anthony's turned out to be a major disappointment. After seeing the 4.5 star average on Yelp I was expecting greatness, however the food and service were mediocre/poor. I hate to give negative reviews, but this place deserved it in my mind. I hope my Yelp friends who gave this place 4 or 5 stars would crusify me.  My mother had the Tuna Tartar with avocado, citrus vinaigrette & chips. We both liked it, but it didn't blow us away. I ordered the Prime Ribeye with the au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach. My ribeye came out and we were told the side dishes were coming in \"ten seconds\".  A few minutes later our waitress came by to see how everything was and I informed her that I still haven't started to eat my steak since I am waiting for my sides. She assured me they will be out shortly. Seven minutes after my steak they finally came! Bullshit! I expect my sides to come out at the same time as my steak so I can enjoy them together. I think that is pretty standard and not an outlandish request. When they were brought to our table there was no apology for the delay. Unlike other steakhouses I have been to Vic & Anthony's didn't serve the first scoop of the side dish onto your plate. I know that makes me sound like some regal, high expectation asshole, but I'm sorry, that's one of the many things that makes the best steakhouses stand out (Mastro's for example). I wasn't crazy about the creamed spinach and the au gratin potatos were waaaaaaay to cheesy for my liking. The steak was not what I was hoping for.  Lastly, our waitress was inattentive, unfriendly, unapologetic, and I don't think smiled once throughout our meal. Maybe it was an off night, but when you are paying big bucks for a nice steak dinner there should be no off nights. I'll be back in downtown Las Vegas in two weeks and I will be sure to avoid Vic & Anthony's.",

I regret forgetting the name of our waiter, a young man from South Africa, but I will say his level of service went above and beyond.  He really made us feel special.  We started our meal with the Oysters Rockefeller and they were probably the most amazing Oysters Rockefeller I have ever had.  Soo good, so creamy and perfect.  We then had the lobster bisque and just that soup was worth coming in.  It was incredible, so delicious, so perfect.  Later on that night I wanted to go back just to have more soup.  It was the best Lobster Bisque I have ever tasted.  We shared the Porterhouse for 2.  The meat was perfection and we had the Mac and Cheese side, yes it was rich, but I was on vacation so I treated myself.  It was perfect.  Finished off with a complimentary Creme Brulee to celebrate my sister's birthday.  It was very delicious.  I will say the meal was amazing and the service was 5 stars.  Will definitely eat here again.  I hope I get the same waiter.",

    "text": "One of several restaurants inside The Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino, Vic & Anthony's is a classic steakhouse, full of old Vegas charm with a modern twist. While not inexpensive, the menu provides value if you order correctly because the portions are HUGE - almost too big to share between only two people! My best friend and I shared an amazing artisan cheese plate (market price, $26), each had a salad (she, the Pear & Saga Blue Cheese; me, the Classic Wedge) and finally split Chicken Paige. In the salad course, we questioned how we could even ATTEMPT to eat our entree, so large were the two previous portions.   Our table service was perfect: a charming, well-informed waiter, at the ready with suggestions. The host/hostess stand could use a few pointers, however. Our 8:30 PM reservation became a 9:00 PM seating, seemingly because a wedding party staged an impromptu post-ceremony dinner. Likely because the restaurant sits on the main corridor of the Golden Nugget's shops, bars and restaurants, its seating area is limited to one, very small, two-person bench. Waiting consists of wandering around in the fluorescent horror of the meeting point of consumerism and casino gambling or clinging to the wall inside the dark hipness of the restaurant, with the glow of the cold case and lobster tank as light sources. That's jarring enough, but the hostess and host talking about how much they hate Friday nights while failing to recognize incoming guests isn't exactly a confidence booster. Thankfully, we shook the wait off easily once we were seated.     This is old school, coursed dining, so don't expect a quick meal between table games or use it as a stop on a stroll of Fremont Street. Prepare to linger in its dark, vintage ambiance over an incredible wine list, a menu filled with a options a plenty (even vegetarians can find something) and some great people watching. DO heed the warnings about entree and side sizes: either go hungry or attempt to choose one side for every two to three people at the table. The desserts we saw were far closer to individual size, but - especially after a meal like one could easily have - sharing those might be an excellent idea too.  While casual dress seems allowable, select something finer and have a time-honored, high roller Vegas dinner, even if you don't gamble!",

    "text": "The last time my father in-law was in town, he went to Vic & Anthony's with a friend and enjoyed it so much, he needed to go back... I was a little hesitant going to a steakhouse as my last few experiences have been bleh sides and grumpy waiters.  First, the atmosphere is perfect. We sat at the bar as the 4 of us were very causal. Very comfortable bar stools, spacious, nice dark lighting, perfect old music...  The portions are huge so be careful of over ordering as we did. The broiled portabella was juicy and tasty. The caprese salad was very well prepared. The tower of chips and onion strings were ok (the chips were better, but a gigantic portion of onion strings)  Next came the wedge salad. They cut it in half for my husband and I to split, and my plate alone was a huge dinner portion salad! Very crisp fresh iceberg lettuce and they served it on a chilled plate! Very smart touch.  Finally, my husband and I split sides: Broccoli, creamed corn, grilled asparagus, and the baked potato no bacon. Again, huge sides. But all very good and very fresh. No microwave tasting potato or rubbery canned corn here.  OH I forgot another fantastic part. The Pinot Noir from Oregon is fantastically smooth. The cheese platter is delicious. Its pricey though.... says market price on the menu so ask if you are interested. Ours came out to $27 I think, but they gave us a variety of 8 cheese (good portions of each), honeycomb, seasonal, sweet blueberries and blackberries, and dried sugared orange rinds. Perfect spread to construct many tasty little cheese breads.  Will be back... great romantic spot for couples!",

My wife is in a wheelchair, and we had to wait a bit for a table, even with a reservation, because of the stairs to certain parts of the dining room.  No matter, the servers were all very solicitous, without being overpowering. All of our needs were met quickly; we never waited for anything.  Everything was delicious...Darlene had the lobster and filet special; I had bone-in ribeye. I've dined in many steakhouses here in Vegas, and this is up with the best (LV Weekly had it in its 2nd town). It's the slightest notch below CUT/Carnevino/ Prime triumverate. If I could award 4.5, or 4.7, I would. I just cant give it 5 stars, due to the ADA-unfriendly dining room and the fact that the above 3 (and apparently Ramsay and Old Homestead)are ridiculously sublime. But on a price/location/quality nexus, this place is in the top 10 in town. (Going back next week)",

    "text": "Me and my party ate here last night for my friend's birthday. It was recommended by a friend so I thought to give it a try and I was not disappointed, It is located at the Golden Nugget Casino and near the entrance of the casino. We got there early. I recommend making reservations. We waited at the little bar which was small but well stocked and the service was good.  The atmosphere is old school steakhouse, dimly lit, leather chairs and wooden decor and even had some Frank Sinatra style jazzy music, how Las Vegas. It was crowded for a weekday and the noise level was a little loud. We were fortunate to get a very good waiter by the name of Hector. He was very professional, attentive and knowledgeable. We started with the lobster bisque, $9.99 which I would highly recommend. Me and my guest shared a porterhouse for 2 ($59.00 per person) and ordered sides of wild mushrooms and steamed broccoli. Everything is al a carte which is typical of fancy steakhouses. The wife had the grilled salmon that comes with lump crab meat. Well prepared and delicious. Her dish came with mashed potatoes and asparagus spears. The steak was a little undercooked for my taste, lots of rare for ordering medium but wonderful just the same. Along with a couple of nice glasses of Cabernet the bill came out to about $250,00. Not to bad for the money, after all this is Las Vegas, even if it is in the old side of casino row.  There are lots of great steakhouses in Las Vegas and I would like to check a few more of them out for comparison. I really liked this one though.",

I wanted wine with my steak.  The wine list is extensive, so I asked for a reasonable priced bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, nothing too expensive.  I thought he would recommend a 100-150 bottle.  He suggested a bottle that was $450.  I laughed.  He gave me attitude, so I ordered a kettle One martini.  After that his attitude and service changed.  The other server was nice and more helpful.  I ordered a Rib eye on the bone.  Extremely rare cut and it was delicious.  But the whole dining experience was tainted by the stuck up waiter.  We ate the next night at Hugo's Cellar at the Four Queens and had a terrific dinner.",

They were a little tough and just didn't have much flavor, which is what I go to a steakhouse for.   I would actually try this place again, just to try their enormous lobster tails that you see on display in the front of the restaurant. And because it was a wonderfully run place. Maybe next time, I'll go for the prime rib and maybe it'll be better than the rib eye.",

    "text": "I recently found myself in Vegas on business and decided to head down town on my last night on a recommendation to try Vic & Antimony's. I had read a few reviews and was excited to enjoy some of their signature items.  When I arrived I was impressed with the decor, which I like to describe as 1977 meets 2007.  It's got dark woods and some cream colors with heavy curtains, that adorn large windows and decorated walls. Very tasteful.  I immediately noticed the glass display case featuring rib-eye, new york, and porterhouse cuts as well as LARGE (and i mean HUGE) Australian cold water tails that were 18-20oz EACH. They also house two lobster tanks with 3-4 pound lobsters which they offer at $29 per pound (which I think is a little high).  We were sat at a nice table in the center of the restaurant and ordered several items.  I did not opt for the lobster tails, as they are $145 each (not a bad price, but a little outside my range for the evening). Next time though I will bring my brother and split a 12oz filet and 20oz lobster.  To start, we got the Calamari, which is tossed in a onion-pepper sauce. The portion was large and included LOTS of really nice caramelized onions, however in my opinion the sauce was too thick and the rings should have been tossed in it instead of just placed on top. Also the breading on the rings was more crumb based and heavy. Would have been better with panko. Rings and tentacles were nicely cooked however, not stringy or rubbery.  $12.95 7/10  Next we received the Pear and Saga Blue Cheese Salad, mixed field greens with teardrop tomatoes, candied pecans and house-made creamy vinaigrette.  A really excellent salad.  The pears were nice and ripe, the pecans crunchy and fresh. There was quite a bit of avocado as well, just enough dressing which was sweet, tangy and slightly thickened. A nice compliment to the pear and cheese.  I would go back for this one again. 11.50. 10/10  Our third course was their famous lobster bisque. It's not an overly large portion, but what was lacking in quantity was more than made up for in quality.  I've had few better bisques.  Rich and creamy (but not overly so) this dish did NOT suffer from having too much sherry cream, but at the same time the sherry flavor was front and center but not overbearing. It's also finished with cognac, and that is easily tasted too.  Decent amount of lobster meat, intense (in a good way) lobster flavor. I could eat it non-stop! 10/10 A STEAL at $9.95.  Main Course was the Sea Bas ala Nage.  They use Chilean Sea Bass as the protein, sauteed in a Dunginess crab butter sauce, balsamic, harcourt verts, roasted tomatoes and topped with a few lumps of dungeness crab.  I've eaten a lot of chilean sea bass in my day, it's probably my favorite protein. This ranks in the top 2 for sure.  Wonderfully cooked, perfect crust on the fish, perfectly accompanied by the butter sauce, nicely cut by the sharpness of the balsamic. Verts were al dente, and nicely cooked. The mound of roasted tomatoes also helped cut the natural oiliness of the bass.  Melt in your mouth. A True triumph. $36.95 10/10  I also tried some of the 8oz filet, and it was beautifully done and seasoned. Rock salt in the preparation makes all the difference! I definitely would not hesitate to order cut beef at this restaurant if I was in the mood. They offer a number of sauces including a bone marrow borderlaise, which wasn't ordered, but I would love to try it in the future.  9/10  For desert we ordered their famous bread pudding, which is served like a layer cake slice in a pool of whiskey sauce alongside praline ice cream, and a brittle sculpture (edible).  Amazing.  Totally moist, amazing flavors. Everything you want out of a bread pudding without the sloppy look. Ice cream was divine.  I ate pretty much the entire brittle decoration which was killer good as well. 10/10 We also got a flour-less chocolate cake topped with unsweetened whipped cream and surrounded by chocolate sauce. VERY DENSE, very good.  Somehow not overbearing and dry-tasting like ones I have had at Ruth's Chris. Difficult to eat all of on your own. Split the chocolate if you get it. 9/10.  I also got earl grey tea, which I wouldn't normally mention, but it came in a very interesting tea pot of stainless and blown glass. Hard to explain but I thought it was neat.  If you're a tea drinker try it.  The tea itself was excellent as well.  All in all, this is one of my new favorite restaurants in Las Vegas and I will be returning as soon as I can for that massive Lobster!",

I ordered the Roasted Salmon stuffed with Crab meat, with asparagus & mash potatoe, omg, sooo delicious!  My husband ordered a steak, forgot which one, very tasty.  Ordered mushroom on the side, a bit too salty to taste. Everything was great, but it was a bit pricey. We had 8 ppl, ordered 1 bottle of red wine, most ordered steak except for 3 of us, maybe about 6 sides, came out to be $650. Or maybe that wasn't too bad...but given that this rest was inside Golden Nugget Casino Hotel...didn't think price would be high...but the food was delicious.",

    "text": "This place has so many good reviews already, but let me just try to further persuade whoever is deciding if they should go to Vic & Anthony's for a good piece of meat and excellent service.   I took my family here for my mom's birthday on a Sunday night.  A party of five.  We arrived fifteen minutes late from our reservation.  We had to wait for a couple minutes and were seated shortly after.  I love the mahogany decor and the dimmed lighting - very romantic.    Our server, Victor, was very nice.  I was skeptical of his nicety at first - thinking he is going to try to sell me the most expensive item on the menu.  As it turns out, he kind of knew what he was talking about.  He recommended a promotional red wine, which our party loved.  The boyfriend ordered a bombay sapphire, and he liked it.  (He then finished up the bottle of red wine also.)    For appetizer, we had the steak tartar, the infamous crab cake, and a dozen of the fresh oysters.  All were delicious except for the crab cake.  Not that the crab cake had anything wrong with it, but it was \"a crab cake with an edge\" to quote the boyfriend.  It was chunky crab meats, which is always a plus, but it didn't have as much flavor to it as I would have liked.  So go ahead, give it a shot if crab cakes are your thing.  It was by no mean terrible.  The steak tartar was very fresh - no one got sick afterward.  The oysters - almost comparable to those served in Santa Monica, CA.   Our group shared a caesar salad and the spinach salad (recommended by Victor), and they were also delicious.  The spinach salad triumphs the caesar, however, in my humble opinion.  The spinach salad is tossed with this honey vinaigrette, that is to die for, really.  It is a very flavor dressing but not one that weighs down your palette.  It leaves a fresh, light, summery feel to your mouth after each bite.  We also tried the lobster bisque, and it was also very good.  However, Joe's Stonecrab at the Forum Shop might have a slightly better one - just slightly...   Onto the entrees!!!  We had the bone-in ribeye - medium rare, prime ribeye - medium, organic lamb chop - medium rare, and the shrimp scampi.  The bone-in ribeye was to die for!  I mean, the meat literally melted in my mouth!!  The perfect texture and temperature - I couldn't believe that I had found a better place for ribeye (Flemin's and Joe's was previously my favorite.)  The prime ribeye was good, but maybe because it was cooked to the temperature of medium, it made the texture a bit tougher than I'd like, but still very good.  As for the lamb chops - I don't personally like lamb chops, but I had a bite, and to my little knowledge with lamb chop, it was passable.  The boyfriend had the lamb chops, and he killed it - finishing it by picking up the rib and torn what was left off on the bone.  Lastly, the shrimp scampi was good, but I think by the time we tried the shrimp, we were so full.  What was interesting with this shrimp scampi was the sauce - it was of a spicy tomato sauce, which was very good with the fresh ciabatta bread they serve throughout our meal.    We also had the wild mushrooms and mac and cheese as sides.  No one, except the boyfriend, liked the wild mushrooms.  Mac and cheese was okay...  Nothing special.   We didn't have dessert since we had cake at home, but they do have the largest scotch menu I have ever seen.    Last but not least, I promise to wrap this up, the service there is great!!!  I mean, I am a True believer of good, friendly customer service.  If they serve good food, but terrible service, I wouldn't see the point to come back.  Our glasses were always filled, and Victor was so honest about what was good (or maybe the menu just didn't have anything bad...)  Anyways, the service is what made me give this place the fifth star.   I hope I have convinced those who want to come to Vic & Anthony's but are skeptical of going downtown to the Golden Nugget thinking how could downtown has good steaks to offer.  I was skeptical once, but now I am a True believer.  I would definitely come back to Vic & Anthony's.    Enjoy!!!",

    "text": "LV Steak House with bad L.A. Attitude!  I would have given this place a higher rating if it weren't for the AWFUL service  and SNOBBISH attitude we received from the blonde hostess when we walked in!  If I wanted to be treated terribly, I would have stayed home and dined at \"Mastro's\" in Beverly Hills.  Take my advice guys, dine else where!  There are plenty of better steak houses in LV that will treat you like a human being!    I have always wanted to try this steak house but always dine across the street at Binion's Ranch.  But this trip I had a party of 5 that I needed to entertain and they have all been to Binion's, so we decided to try a new place and Vic & Anthony's was the choice.  I booked the dinner reservation about a month in advance for a WEDNESDAY night when I knew they would NOT be busy, however when I arrived EARLY for our reservation, I was immediately greeted by a RUDE, OBNOXIOUS, SNOBBISH, L.A. wanna be little blonde starlet who treated me awful and refused to give me any service or grant me the option to seat us at a comfortable round table!  Her response?.....oh, sorry sir, the round tables are RESERVED!  We can only seat you where we can seat you!  (This was coming out of her mouth at 7:30pm on a Wednesday night with a total of 2 parties dining in the entire restaurant and probably only 5 reservations for that night!  What a joke) and by the way, the round tables were available the ENTIRE NIGHT we were there!  4 hours and $860.00 later, I left Vic & Anthony's with a bitter taste in my mouth but not from the meal, it was from the blonde hostess who's unwelcoming attitude will assure that I never return to this restaurant and discourage others from dining here as well.    The Bottom Line: Awful rude service from the front, an extra salty steak that isn't great (but good), but surprisingly; probably one of the best Veal cuts one could ever taste!  \"Try the Veal, it's one of the best in the city\" - Godfather  Enjoy!",

    "text": "The filet mignon was among the five best steaks of my life. My wife had the best seabass she's ever eaten.  The atmosphere is romantic but not stuffy or overly formal.  The service is good (thanks Dennis) the drinks are reasonably priced ($6 beer) and the entrees fetch standard steakhouse prices of around $40 for a steak.   The sides are nice but the creamed spinach could more accurately be described as cheese with a bit of spinach. The pear salad was amazing and the potatoes Lyonnaise were great too.   I'm a steak lover and the filet was really outatanding. It had a nice flavor as if it had been seasoned or marinated, but the taste complemented rather than overpowered the meat. The filet wasn't so heavy that I felt like I was biting into a cow.   I would dine here again in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "My theme of this review is a shout out to my boy Drake because it's one of  \"The Best I Ever Had\" and you'll read why.  Located in the most unpretentious hotel, not on the glamorous side of the Strip, Vic & Anthony's is a hidden gem within a hidden gem.  Sure, I was apprehensive but V&A's is Michelin rated, granted it's just one star but, that's one more than most of the restos on the Strip.  First off, do your research, check out their menu on the Golden Nugget website and make reservations.  They offer a prix fixe menu, which is a super deal.  It comes with your choices of soup or salad to start, three entrees to choose from, a selection of sides and a dessert to share.  For $46.95 per person, it's a super deal.  If you calculate it, between two people, you're getting one side and the dessert for free.  However, you have to know to order this PF deal, as it will not be listed on the menu nor will they offer it to you.  Think of it as an exclusive secret society menu...mwahaha!  However to start,  we ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake, which seriously had to be the,  \"Best CC I Ever Had.\"  Why do I say that?  Well, it was jam packed with pieces of lump crab just as the name states, not crab shreds, crab filler or krab with a k.  The s/o and I had the Lobster Bisque, which was truly rich and creamy with bits of lobster in it.  We both literally licked our respective bowls and used pieces of bread to clean the bowls!  This LB was the,  \"Best LB I Ever Had.\"  I was going to order the Sea Bass but the s/o gave me a dirty look about ordering seafood at a steakhouse.  I'm just not a fan of Filet Mignon and it's thick cut but, the s/o's right, it IS a steakhouse.  However to my delight, the FM was so tender, juicy and flavorful.  Hmm...V&A has made me a believer, maybe I've just had crappy FM in the past?  So again, this was the \"Best FM I Ever Had.\"  We both got a choice of side, which is big enough for 2-3 people to share.  We ordered the Creamed Spinach and Au Gratin Potatoes.  Both were not necessarily the, \"Best I Ever Had\" but both were quite delicious.  For dessert, we choose the Croissant Bread Pudding.  Wow, there's something about the elegance of a croissant that just made this bread pudding like no other.  Instead of being flat and heavy, it was just the opposite.  The side of ice cream was a pure delight.  So, was this the \"Best Bread Pudding I Ever Had?\"  Damn right!  The service was truly outstanding!  From the hostess, to our server and other wait staff.  My only thing was that the restaurant was really dark, or maybe my eyes are just going bad?  V&A is top notch and is worth skipping the toney Strip restos.  And in closing, I'm ending this review the same way Drake ended his song, \"Best I Ever Had,\"  \"See this is the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody, make sure it's that special somebody....\"",

    "text": "My experience at Vic and Anthony's was by far one of the best I've ever had.  My guy and I had our last dinner here while on vacation in Vegas. We went all out and had the porterhouse steak for two with a side of broccoli and mashed potatoes with the added bonus of a fresh 3 1/2 pound lobster which I was able to select.  The mashed potatoes were OK, not the greatest I've ever had as they were not quite mashed enough to my liking..there were still chunks of potatoes mixed in. The broccoli was good, hard to go wrong with a simple steamed broccoli. The lobster was outstanding and cooked to perfection! Super buttery and delicious, im salivating just thinking about it as I type this.  Now, for the porterhouse...what a beautiful thick chunk of meat!  The server brought it out to us and asked if it was to our liking, we gave him the OK he took it back and cut it for us. The meat was delicious up until the end where one side of it was a little tough but definitely still edible (this is the only reason why I'm not giving V&A's 5 stars).  The service was impeccable, our server who's name I've forgotten was amazingly helpful and attentive. He genuinely seemed happy to be there and very knowledgeable about the menu, both the wine list and the food.  It was our anniversary dinner and I had let that be known to our server whom at the end of the our meal brought us out a slice of cheesecake. And oh what a slice it was! I thought the portions they give out at the cheesecake factory was big! haha  In conclusion, I would highly reccomend Vic and Anthony's as a place to go for a nice dinner. You forget that you are even in downtown Vegas when here. Good food and outstanding service! :)",

    "text": "The best meal I have probably ever had.   My husband & I eloped a year ago and renewed our vows for 20 family members & friends in Las Vegas.  We wanted a steak house for a couple of reasons; one to please the men in our party and also I have allergies to gluten and know that a steak-house menu is easy to order from.   We picked Vic & Anthony's based on their yelp reviews and availability on a Friday night (during a fight weekend).  We were sat right away and our server Annette was funny, curteous, and most importantly put up with our motley crew.  The sommelier on site was great too.  I forgot his name, but he had great suggestions.  The food - oh the food! - came out at a reasonable pace and was delicious!  Our friend actually said \"I don't want to swallow because I want the taste to last forever!\" Because we had a large party, we ordered a number of different items.  My personal favorite was the scallops and the cheesy potatoes.  The best part were the steaks!  They were seasoned perfectly and cooked to mouth-watering amazing-ness.  Most of us in our party work in the restaurant/bar/service industry and we were over the moon with this restaurant. It was a wonderful evening of food and family.  We will recommend this place again and again. PS - it was fun to walk out on to Fremont Street afterwards to people watch!",

This place is very good and super nice. I liked that they made my buddy take off his hat, respectable..... I like that. This place would get 5 Stars but I think the price is a little high for what you get. None the less I would eat here again and both the steak and seafood was AWESOME here.",

We arrived 10 minutes early and were greated warmly by the hostess.  They offered to seat us immediately or to let us enjoy a drink at the bar.  We chose to be seated immediately.  Our waiter, Hector, arrived quickly with the menus.  Bread, butter and water arrived before we even opened the menus. The sommelier accomodated our request quickly and spent some time discussing a couple of our favorite Paso Robles wines.    Great choice for dinner.  Had a great meal, great service, and a reason to dress up on Fremont Street.  Thank you for a great evening.",

I would love to go back and have a steak!    Now for the not so great:  The crab legs came out in a pool of melted butter  - with more melted butter in a ramekin on the table.  Yee gads so much butter!  I could not get the meat out of the shell as the legs were slip slidin away on the plate.  I finally had to use the bread plate to move my crab legs over out of the pool to dig into them.  Our server never dropped a discard plate for the shells and I had to ask for a hand towel to wipe my hands from the buttery mess.  Overall we like the place and next time if I order crab I will ask for it steamed with butter on the side",

    "text": "Old school Vegas steakhouse. Was a bit hesitant because it's located in the golden nugget downtown Vegas. If you've been downtown Fremont street you know what I'm talking a bout. It's a freak show, my retinas are still burning from the human filth that scoures the area.... Well once inside the place it's old Vegas , high back leather, dim lights, service was spot on, real good, but not bothersome. They tend to your every need. Good wine selection and wow, I drink bourbon, they had a list of high end stuff to choose from, very nice, we had roast beet salad, Caesar salad which they were more than happy to split for us, filet mignon, and of course lobster tails. Steak was great, cooked to our likes! Perfect. And the lobster was fantastic... Tender, sweet, and cooked so well. They don't give you the greasy butter bath to dip it. It needs nothing but cut and enjoy, so we'll done. It's not a cheap experience, dinner for 2 was over 300 with of course a well deserved tip ! When back in town, I will go back to Vic's! Tackle the 35 oz cold water lobster tail. One more thing. We dressed nice, you'll see tourists wearing hawaiin shirts, one ass wore shorts and flips, dress right people, they won't stop you from dining if your that guy. But you make the place a lil less with your old ratty clothing.... Oh, I would of went 5 stars.... Take away one for the young snooty girls who work the front desk and seat you. Lighten up ladies, your not solving the worlds problems, they don't make you feel welcome... They act like they are doing you a favor! Not a good first impression. I almost told them to stuff it... But my girl kicked me in the shin.. And off to the table we went... Vic, retrain the desk girls plz......",

    "text": "Officially my favorite steakhouse hands down!  As if Vegas doesn't have enough to write about, this little gem is in one of the remaining standouts of what some call \"Old Vegas\".  The meal got off to a great start at the bar as we waited for our table.  The service was fast, the drinks were well made and naturally they were top shelf.  I was particularly pleased with the professional look and feel of the place.  Its very old school, mafioso, dark, white linen, with the sounds of clinking wine glasses and lively conversation in the background.    The food:  Excellent!  Your steak is served as intended, well aged beef cooked to order on a hot plate...nothing else!  Fantastic.  The sides are of sharable portions so agree on one for every 2 or 3 people unless you plan on toting a box of leftovers around Vegas.  The mac and cheese is perfect as is the smooth and creamy lobster bisque.  The other members in my party had several cuts of meat and one had a chicken dish...my sincerest apologies for not having info on those.  Fact is, I wanted every square inch of space in my belly for the rib eye on my plate.  Like sooo many other reviews about this place, it was melt in your mouth good.  We also ordered a chocolate gnash desert that could only be made better by eating it off of your favorite super models body, otherwise it was absolute perfection.    Service was superb.  Our waiter was attentive, informative and practiced.  He was professional and friendly.  Over all a fantastic experience.  I will definitely be returning.  Highly recommend this location to anyone.  You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Good service, dark, pricey, but decent eats.     I wanted a good steak. I knew this place was pricey, which it is, but I was craving meat.  My girl ordered the steak-lobster special and I ordered a 8 oz fillet, we both ordered them medium rare.   When the steaks came I was instructed to cut into the center and check it, if you dont like it we can fix it.  I'm like what?, but I'll get to this in a minute.  So the steaks come, hot as hell, I'm guessing they didn't even let it stand, anyway we cut into them as instructed and the suckers were cold and raw in the center.  It was even too rare for my girl which She will basically eat hers usually very rare.   The waiter instructs we we can just heat that up more.  Ok here's what I find wrong.   Medium rare should be warm in the middle, even by just pressing on the steaks I could tell it was rare.  Shouldn't a steak house charging these types of prices know better.  Once you cut the thing in half then put it back on the grill its going to dry out.  Away, so they give it a good again, steaks come back, plates hot as hell, but the damn thing is cold in the middle, huh?   The servicer quickly says , I have them make another one and hes gone.   So what comes out is this tiny fillet thats about 3/4\" thick, dry and over cooked.      At this point, I realize this is not going well, I just shut my mouth and eat.  I'm  not all that hungry, since I was snacking on her lobster, which was good.  The pesto and basil mash potatos were very good.   So in the end, I left not filling my desire for steak from a steak house, bummer.  I can't knock the service, I found the service to be excellent, but in the end the steak was the disappointing.",

Oh yeah, hubby and I will be back with others.  Tip: Go to their website and print out the Distinctive Dining  Deal menu (You will get 3 courses w/ sides for a great price)  Note: It is not a very kid friendly restaurant - I called a few months ago to make reservation and was told that if the child is too young and start making a fuss, we may be asked to leave. We decided not to risk it with my 2 year old niece. Having said that, when we were at the restaurant, we did see children that's about 5 or 6 years old. So, parents:  use your best judgement :)",

Not fresh tasting or a light crispy batter. My friend had shrimp cocktail which was fine and a more manageable size. The cocktails were nice and the wine list was very extensive and expensive of course, but the steak, which was the reason we visited this place was not good enough for a $200 meal.

    "text": "food was great here!  Great art deco design. The service was interesting to say the least.  We walked into  the restaurant where we stood for 10 minutes without the hostess acknowleding we were standing there or even looked up. Our server came by several times to check to see how the food was or if we needed anything.  At one point he came by to make small talk that was painfully forced.  The busser was subpar...he came by several times to fill up water and spilled it all over my phone and didn't even notice even when I said something.  We ordered the foie gras apppetizer, lobster bisque soup, bone in prime ribeye, onion shoestrings, mac n cheese, and creamed spinach.  The appetizer and soup were okay, but the ribeye and sides are top notch.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly rare as requested. It was super tender and seasoned perfectly.  The onion shoestrings came out as a heaping pile of crispy salty perfection on a plate...enough for 4 people. The mac n cheese was creamy and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. the creamed spinach was loaded with cream and cheese and had a crumbly topping. All the sides were large enough for at least 2 people.  My only wish was that I had room for dessert...will definately save room next time for the creme brulee or the bread pudding!",

The crab cake is the best item on the menu for me.  A generous portion of lump crab with very minimal breading is pan fried and served piping hot.  The steak tartare is just a must!    I appreciate the method of preparing their steaks.  It's seasoned lightly with salt and nothing else.  You have the option of ordering a sauce but I really see no point with quality meat.  Just be sure they understand what medium rare means.  My steak was medium to medium well.  I could have sent my steak back but the service was superb.   Excellent list of wines.  A variety of notable Napa wines that most restaurants do not carry such as Shafer and Peju.  Also, nice selection of Mendoza Malbec wines.",

The crab cake appetizer was delicious and maybe the best we had tasted in a long time. Wife ordered the surf & turf special - lobster tail and 8 oz filet; I ordered the 12 oz filet with a side of wild mushrooms. Both filets cooked to a perfect medium rare, with the lobster broiled just right. The wild mushrooms tasted great with the filets! Waitress was nice and brought us a dessert plate with a small cheesecake and chocolate mousse as a comp - much appreciated and very tasty. Ordering any more would have been far too much food, we were pleasantly stuffed without being uncomfortable. We will definitely repeat this order on our next trip to LV.",

The next day I went back to the restaurant to get my money back. They said my card went through. I feel we over paid. Vic and Anthony's gave me the run a round. I will not be going back to Vic and Anthony's. My cousin also got three different checks for her dinner. Vic and Anthony's need to turn up the lights so their employees can see what they are doing. They made too many mistakes with other people's money. Not cool.  Very unhappy customer.",

The service is impeccable and the food speaks for itself. None better! We like coming with a group and trying different things. From steaks to chops and chicken to seafood-you won't ever be disappointed. Excellent sourdough bread and butter as you wait for your appetizer/salad/soup. Try the beet salad. Yummmm! We had the special that consisted of an 8oz. Filet and lobster tail with assorted vegetables ($79) and added the potato puree. The steak was exactly medium rare, as ordered and that lobster was out of this world! We have NEVER been disappointed when we visit here. Must try the crab cake and if your budget allows- get the lobster that's market priced and you must order the 3 1/2lb lobster. Ours was $165, but was worth every penny!! It's so huge, they slice it for you. Bread pudding, creme brulee, cheesecake are all a fabulous ending. You'll be glad you ate here!!",

    "text": "My high expectations were met with disappointment. The food was just okay for me. The meal was rather forgettable, nothing really stood out enough for me me to say \"I'd order this again!\"  The dinner service got off on a very rough start when they refused to seat our party of 11. They refused to seat us because 1 out of 11 of us was running late. ONE person out of 11......does that even make any f'kng sense?  The 2 doctors in our party tried repeatedly to request to the servers and even the manager, but they refused and kept us waiting at the small narrow bar area for almost 45 mins. Some of us got tipsy while waiting for our tables, while most of us just got agitated for having to wait so long.   It would've been 35 min wait, but the manager seemed to be OCD or unsatisfied w/the table set-up so he made the staff move and rearrange our tables further down from the its original location. Tacking on additional wait time for us at the cramped bar.   As I said earlier, the food was alright. Nothing spectacular, nothing memorable.  CHICKEN PAIGE ($26.95):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=DFV2Zg8N6ZaECfizTAIddA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC...</a> Scallopined/thinly cut chicken breasts lightly breaded and pan-fried in a lemon butter sauce. The menu also listed capers and sundried tomatoes cooked into the sauce, but I found cooked down regular tomatoes. No biggie. The portion size was generous and it was tasty.   FRESH FISH A LA NAGE (halibut was the fish special that night, $36.95)  The halibut filet was stuffed w/jumbo lump crab meat and served w/baby vegetables.  I didn't get a chance to take a pic of it, but I was able to steal a couple fork-fulls.   The under-seasoned halibut was unevenly cooked, some parts were dry and overcooked.  I'm not so sure if the \"a la nage\" or poaching part was entirely True.  Perhaps the poaching liquid or \"nage\" was just used to dress the fish after it's been cooked.   JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKES (1 crab cake for $19.95):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=vMTQgbpbzaTeSUFUAhOp5A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC...</a>  Yes, you read that right. It's $19 for ONE crab cake.  The crab cake was topped off with additional crab meat and a chive buerre blanc.   For me, a good buerre blanc should be light and airy, yet rich and thick enough to coat whatever food it's drizzled on.   This sauce was darker and more orange, I've never seen any buerre blanc (means \"white butter\" in French cooking) that dark before. It looked very similar to the sundried tomato sauce that was in my Chicken Paige dish.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=DFV2Zg8N6ZaECfizTAIddA#DFV2Zg8N6ZaECfizTAIddA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC...</a>  BROILED PORTABELLO MUSHROOMS W/RED WINE VINAIGRETTE ($9.95): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=07F2D7XHPQxYjnyOYYg6zw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC...</a> Dressed w/basil oil, fresh diced tomatoes and \"fresh mozzarella.\"  The mozzarella had no flavor and was a bit on the dry side. Some cubes crumbled very easily, almost like feta cheese.   When I see \"fresh mozzarella\" on the menu, I'm expecting the cheese to have a higher moisture content, resulting in a more soft to semi-soft cheese. This was not the case.   RAW OYSTERS (6 for $14.95): Plump fresh oysters. 'Nuff said.  OYSTERS ROCKERFELLER (6 for $15.95): Everyone raves about this dish, so of course we had to get a couple orders for our large party. It was okay. I got chopped herbs, bread crumbs and butter. I wasn't wowed by this dish.   FRIED OYSTERS w/malt vinegar tartar sauce (6 for $11.95):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=NwbMJiBs__-RuwiMIjRLLA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC...</a> Out of the 3 oyster dishes, this was the one I was looking forward to. Like the raw oyster and oyster rockerfeller, these fried oysters were also plump and juicy.   The crust (although very greasy) had a nice crunch to it, but that's where the buck stops.  There's nothing more unappetizing than biting into a crunchy fried oyster, only to be disappointed when you find out that you're chewing on some RAW BATTER.  Perhaps they should go back to the basics and use deep-fryer thermometer? Just a thought.   FRESH SPINACH SALAD ($8.95): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=MWLoXcv3T_MXTLgqCp2Ubg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC...</a> This was a favorite amongst most of us (I only got input from our side of the long table, the other half of our large party didn't mention anything about it).   This spinach salad had a mixture of chopped bacon, eggs, kalamata olives, and artichokes. That's my kind of salad! Can't go wrong with crispy bacon! The citrus vinaigrette was the perfect addition to the salty bacon and kalamata olives. I enjoyed this dish very much.   Ironic that my favorite part of the entire meal was a damn salad.....especially when I don't even like veggies. That's actually the very section that I avoid like the plague when I dine out.",

After reading about every Vegas hotspot I found Vic and Anthony's. I perused the menu and realized there was no way I could afford a dinner here. Then after reading my trusty yelpers I saw a review that explained the distinguished menu.   The distinguished menu is posted on the website and must be printed prior to your arrival. It is only $50/person! It includes your choice of starter. We had the wedge salad and lobster bisque- ahhhhhmazing! Next is your entree, we both chose the 8oz filet which was unbelievable and I really couldn't choose words to explain how wonderful they really were. The meal comes with your choice of sides. Be sure to choose 2 different sides as they are more than enough to share. We chose the au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach. Delicious! After all this, yes, you get dessert included in the special! I had creme brulee and my husband had the croissant bread pudding. Again, ahhhhhmazing!   To seal the deal was our waiter. He was attentive and not overbearing. Excellent service and I highly recommend asking for Victor. Easy name to remember given the name of the restaurant!",

Now it is at least a yearly visit for me.  I always find an excuse to travel across the country because of this restaurant.   From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave you are treated to a wonderful dining experience. The ambiance is such that you can get dressed up and make it a formal dining night or make it a semi-casual evening filled with mouth-watering food.  The steaks are cooked well enough that sauce is not needed, but I love their peppercorn sauce so I always order it.  This time I ordered the creamed spinach as a side dish and it was all that you would think a creamy cheesy spinach dish should be. My husband ordered the 12 ounce filet and I ordered my usual prime ribeye. When the steaks came we didn't speak to each other until we devoured the steaks lol.   Oh the drinks there are also made to perfection! There is nothing bad I can write about this place other than I wish there was one in Miami. :-(  Until then, I make a point to visit at least once a year.",

I asked my friend who recommended if this is normal, and she said no, she's never had that issue with any crab cake from any restaurant. I've had crab cakes maybe 5x and never had that issue either. Each bite was crunchy like I was eating a SANDwich from the Little Rascals.  Not to mention it was $24 for one crab cake, smaller than a hockey puck.  I hate to leave negative reviews but this was just a terrible experience and a complete waste of my hard earned money.",

    "text": "I'm writing this from the perspective of a frugal tourist. If you are not price conscious add another half star.  Apparently they got rid of their old special - they used to have a promotion where if you printed out a coupon you could get a set menu (appetizer, steak to your taste, and  desert) for 75 + tip.  That being said, they're still a solid four stars. I really want to be clear they're not *bad* and if I was the kind of person who money was not an object for, I'd probably not leave the GN to eat elsewhere if I was already there to gamble or sleep, but for me I can only afford to pay for a fancy steak dinner once  a year.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend making a special trip from the strip to downtown just for this particular steak house if there's no coupon or you don't have points from their rewards program.  (I do however, recommend checking out the poker room - when I was first learning poker their limit game was a great way to learn the game without breaking the bank)  Also if you're less price conscious, such as planning a business dinner where an extra 20-30 per person isn't a big deal if you can get a group together during a busy convention, they may be a good choice they're less popular than some more trendy spots may be more able to accommodate your part on short notice. If you are having trouble finding a place a group of friends/coworkers can meet during a convention consider checking out here - there's more to Vegas than the strip ;)",

    "text": "For our anniversary every year we do it up right at a top notch steakhouse and celebrate.  Generally, we are home (in Denver, CO), and have our 5 star places we frequent, but this time we happened to be in Vegas doing a 10 year vow renewal and decided to have our steak with some Vegas glitz :) Enter, Vic & Anthony's which by all accounts and many recommendations was THE best steakhouse (and had a bonus of being in the hotel we were staying in, The Golden Nugget).   It will get to it. I thought our dinner was lovely, but not as great as I am used to elsewhere. Here is the thing, it is dark, like really dark in there.  Also, we were seated in between 2 huge tables with 6+ people at them.  It was loud!  So dark and loud, eh, not the greatest. Then we had our waiter introduce himself and get our drinks, only to be handed off at some point to another waiter (probably because of the large groups) who really mostly took care of us.  He didn't introduce himself and at several points could not hear us and would answer questions we didn't ask. Or assume we said things we didn't say. Did I mention it was loud?  Anyways, the food was mostly wonderful. The calamari was sauteed with peppers and onions and had a delicious flavor.  I ordered a filet and it was tender and perfectly cooked medium. I topped it with the Texas jalapeno bacon thing - which had a spicy flavor, but is sauteed in oil because when I decided to dump out the last bit it made the plate oily. We aren't seafood people and a lot of their stuff was seafood based, so we just added a side of salted fries, which were limp - definitely the worst part of the meal (and could easily be fixed by not serving them in a pail).   At the end of the meal they did wish a happy anniversary and gave us two bite size desserts (a chocolate torte and a cheesecake). It was nice and the food did seem high quality, but the vibe wasn't for me. I felt like the corporate accounts that surrounded us were far more taken care of than us (and when you drop a few hundred for dinner, I just expect a little more personalized service).   If you are going on the company dime, go for it. If you a want romantic and special meal, eh, know it might not be here. We are used to personalized attentive service the moment we walk in the door and it didn't happen here, but the food for the most port was top quality. It is Vegas, I guess!",

When my brother asked if they have a restroom he could use, instead of directing my brother where it is, the busser simply said \"no\". Indian woman. But I'm still not bothered.  So as we left and had some food to take home, we strolled to Fremont. Then I was like \"didnt we forget something, our food\". I didnt realize our food to take home was tied in a plastic bag. White plastic bag. The kind of bag you can get anywhere. Other restaurants will put it in a customized paper bag with their logo on it. Vic and Anthony's will give you a plastic bag.

The moment you enter the restaurant there is a tank full of lobsters and a display of raw meats you can choose from. The restaurant itself is very dimly lit, intimate, and decorated like an old school steakhouse (most places downtown are like this).   The menu had amazing options, full of seafood and steak. The appetizers were quite large as well as the sides which are served family style. My boyfriend and I had the surf and turf which was fantastic! The lobster bisque and lobster mac and cheese are a must try! The quality of their meats are just amazing. Each of us had different cuts (filet, ribeye, ny strip) and all were delicious.   The service was quick, but our server did a great job of explaining everything and he was continually checking to make sure we were happy.   This restaurant is upscale, finer dining so expect to pay around $120 per person for dinner. It is well worth it, however. Our dinner was fantastic!",

I usually can't finish even a small steak because I get sick of it quickly. This steak was cooked just as I asked, with perfect crust and texture all throughout the steak. I don't know much about good meat, but my tongue and stomach were truly at bliss. Shout out to the server who told me about Jameson cask mates! I recommend this place wholeheartedly!

We sat in the bar since we arrived a bit early to restaurant early and they were packed, so we thought we'd have a drink.   We did have a reservation in the dining room, but ended up staying and eating at the bar. Jose was one of our servers, I can't remember the other guys name.  But I will say the service was impeccable!!  They went above and beyond with everything and it was a very pleasant experience.  Their wine menu was excellent with lots of great choices from all over the world and descent prices. If your looking for a excellent Cab Sav for a good price try the Long Shadow Pirouette (2014). Yummy!!  I started with the lobster bisque soup and my husband had the Cesar salad.  Both were great..the soup was actually outstanding!!   I ordered the shrimp pasta dish and it was out of this world!!  And a pretty rich combination with the soup starter.  My husband ordered the petite filet and I had the shrimp scampi pasta..soooo good!!  I am not kidding this was melt in your mouth delicious!!  We ordered sides of broccoli, scallop potatoes and cream corn.  I loved the broccoli and scalloped potatoes but cream corn was on the sweet side for me.  The sides were very large portions and for us...we were filling up fast.  We may have had two bites of each side.  Of course we had to try the bread pudding and creme brulee...both were excellent and sharable sizes...we only had room in our bellies for 2 bites:(  All and all a great spot for a business dinner or date night dinner.  Prices were awesome, service A+ and in my humble opinion, better than any restaurant on the Vegas Strip.  I know because we have spent 3 times more $$ at other places and had lousy service and average food.",

It was maybe only 10 minutes until we were able to sit at the bar which had exceptional service.  Jose the bartender is the man! He was inviting and friendly to our group and gave us spectacular menu recommendations. He recommended having the pork belly and crab cake, which was enough for us to share after already eating here and there while hopping around Downtown Las Vegas. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and made a great surf and turf meal.   The dessert was definitely an Instagrammable moment. This liquid of the gods was poured over a chocolate sphere that melted which ended up revealing a chococlate-y banana-y cake. Not sure the name of it as this was another Jose recommendation that we rolled with. I was totally full at this point, but I couldn't stop myself from grabbing another spoonful.  The drinks were also very well made. From what I remembered, my group had a manhattan and I asked for some girly drink that ended up being the lavender lemontini and Jose nailed both of them. Both were delicious and we will definitely be back at Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse in the near future.",

This place lived up to its reputation! Vic & Anthony's is amongst the best steakhouses I have experienced! This restaurant is very beautiful, very elegant and classy! A True dining experience!  It is dark in there as tables are lit by candlelight! A romantic getaway, or, yet a beautiful ambiance amongst friends!  My friend found a very reasonably priced prix fix menu online! Talk about a score, comparable to a \"restaurant week\" menu! We started with our house and Caesar salads, all which were very delicious starters! The four of us ordered Filet Mignon! The Filet Mignons were very tender, juicy! Our steaks were complimented by a wide array of side dishes, such as the Au Gratin Potatoes, Onion Strings, Steamed Broccoli and Stuffed Baked Potato!   For dessert, we ordered the Creme Brulee, Chocolate Mousse Cake and Croissant Bread Pudding! All were to die for! Yummy.... :D   Our post dinner drinks included nice glasses of Port and Cognac! Our waiter was the bomb (sorry couldn't remember his name as we were drinking a lot! Hehe) but he was very energetic, entertaining and lively, which made our dining experience a memorable one! LOL  The ambiance, our dining experience, our waiter and of course our close group of friends who dined here made this a memorable night! We look forward to dining here again! This experience rates a 5-star review in my book, to go with the wonderful dishes and 5-star service by our waiter! If you are ever in downtown Las Vegas or at the Golden Nugget, be sure to check out Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse! :)",

We are nerds who always order the same things....but, that's why we come back, its comfy and easy and we always leave fat and happy.   Crab Cake - perfect for sharing. Wedge Salad - so yummy. Special delicious huge chunks of bleu cheese.  Bone-in Rib Eye - who doesn't love big fat steaks?! Asparagus - the roasted one with balsamic.  1 star off because they never get our table just right. We want to be anywhere that isn't on the main walkway or next to the kitchen door.   #landrysselect",

Best we have ever had! Our server Luciano was amazing! He had excellent recommendations right down to wine pairings! Filet surf et turf and strip with bone marrow was delicious and like no steak we have ever had! The Spiced Pear cocktail was a great introduction to the meal. The shrimp cocktail and roasted bacon were amazing! We also had wild mushrooms (wish I had a stomach as big as my eyes), wedge salad, and mac & cheese (good but not phenomenal like everything else). We finished with the best cheese cake (surprising to us) that we had ever had! Wonderful atmosphere, staff, and experience. Side note,  The golden nugget is a great hotel and pool to stay at. Only wish Las Vegas became smoke free!",

My fiance ordered a 16oz prime rib and I ordered the pork chops (medium-well). Interesting fact by the server: Trichinellosis or Trichinosis was last reported sometimes in the 1900s deeming it safe to order pork chops different forms of cooking styles other than well-done. With some sides of asparagus and Au gratin potatoes... yum.   Although we didn't go for the full three-course meal and headed straight to the entree, we did have complimentary bread to go with the drinks we ordered (Pinot Grigio + Old Fashion).   Upon being served our meal, I slightly mentioned that it was our 5th year anniversary as I was embarrassed to ask for a photo in such a dark setting (flash can be so distracting... sorry to the people around us). Our server, Victor, was extremely attentive and kind. He made our experience remarkable. Thank you Vic & Anthony for another memorable night! ",

They were extremely cheesy in a good way, and also very big. We've been told so many times \"it's big enough to share\"  only to be totally disappointed. These are! No worries though as they were so good we ate most of them and took the meager amount left home.   We had the creme brulee and chocolate mousse for dessert. Both were very good and the creme brulee in particular was large enough for two.   The bill was over $200 and I didn't bat an eye because everything was so good. That's what I expect in a high end steakhouse. Vic and Anthony's completely delivered in every aspect from food to service.",

    "text": "My taste buds are forever altered, after having experienced the deliciousness of the Vic & Anthony's experience.  The restaurant is located inside the Golden Nugget. My wife and I made reservations for 9:45. We are greeted by the hostess who was very friendly. The dining room is not very large, but it did not take away from the fact that it has a very intimate / romantic atmosphere. Perfect since the wife and I were there celebrating our 5th year wedding anniversary that night. The room is dim lit, with candles burning on every table.   As we are escorted to our table, every single waiter is gretting us with \"Good evening\", which was a very classy touch.  We are seated and served our bread basket. The bread alone was so fresh and warm. We start looking through the menu and I plan a strategy. My wife is set on the New York steak which is pretty big. I know for a fact she will not finish it. So I order the 8 oz filet mignon. That way I will eat my steak, and finish her left overs!   Our waiter finally comes around and addresse's me as Mr. \"my last name\" the entire evening which made me feel like a big shot. My wife's New York steak is at market price for $46.50. My filet mignon went for $38.50.  On the side we ordered the Au Gratin Potatoes.  Let me just say that my plan worked perfectly. My wife did not finish her steak, so I got to enjoy them both. I order my filet medium, and my wife requested her's medium well. The steak's literally melted like butter with every bite. Whatever seasoning they used was simply amazing which only enhanced the flavor,. By far the  best tasting steak I have ever had. I will consider it a crime for someone to come to Vegas, and n ot dine at Vic & Anthony's.  The Au Gratin Potatoes were incredible as well. They were baked with cheese on top.  The sides are portioned to share by the way. Very generous portions.  For dessert, we ordered the croissant bread pudding. You seriously do not know what you are missing if you dont try this piece of sweetness. According to our waiter,it won the dessert of the year award. I believe it. It was too good.  It is a pricey restaurant, but well worth every pennie!  We will no doubt be dining here again on our next Vegas trip..",

    "text": "Visited 06.26.15  OMG wow.  Wow wow wow.  First off, this place was amazing, the food was excellent, the service was superior to many other \"fine dining\" establishments and all in all it was a great experience.  The only tiny downside is how close the tables are to each other so it was a bit hard to talk but other than that everything was on point.  Hector was our server and he truly made the experience phenomenal.  His recommendation of the Peju wine made a good meal great and even though my friend and I sat there for 2 hours he never rushed us, checkin when it was appropriate, kept our wine glasses full and all in all gave top notch service.  You rock Hector and I would come back just to hang out with you again.  The food consisted of three courses of mouth watering goodness.  We both had the preset menu and it was worth every penny and then some.    Lobster Bisque - I seriously could have just had a big bowl of this and been completely happy.  It was creamy and smooth, rich but not too rich, a hint of tomato and nice sized pieces of lobster.  Creamed Spinach - ok confession.  I love, love, LOVE creamed spinach.  And when a place does it well like Vic and Anthony's does I love it even more.  Ugh just cannot say enough good things about this dish.  Filet Mignon - excellent cut, cooked just right.  Soft and flavorful.  Excellent.  I ordered mine medium while my friend ordered hers medium well and both came out perfectly cooked.  Chocolate Mousse - ok lets be honest.  By this time I was stuffed so it was hard to eat anything else but I did try it and it was creamy and fluffy and if I wasn't ridiculously fully I would have probably ate the whole thing.    So, all in all a great night of eating and drinking and seriously one of the best meals overall I've had in a long, long time.",

    "text": "The first time we dined at Vic & Anthony's was for our Anniversary on 4/19/16. The food, the service, everything was absolutely phenomenal. That is was brought us back for round two a little over a month later. The food again was absolutely delish. We both ordered the 8oz filet and a 1/2 pound side of crab, puree potatoes and asparagus. We also had the creme brulee for dessert which is a must!!! The second time around, the service was absolutely dreadful. Growing up in this town and seeing how things work, we more often then not get mistaken for \"children who probably won't tip well.\" It is ridiculous. Just because I'm young doesn't mean I'm going to tip like shit. Now that you have given me terrible service and only touched our table once since we got our food, that is what will give you a bad tip. We constantly needed refills. Our server at one time glanced at our table, saw my husband needed and coke, then proceeded to greet the 8-top that just sat down. His spiel took almost 10 min. Fortunately we both work in the industry so we know what good service and bad service is, but when you are paying $100 per person to eat, you think the service would be above the rest.   **One server does not make a restaurant terrible. It is just unfortunate that a great restaurant hires incompetent servers.",

During our stay in Vegas, my sweetie said she wanted to try this place she found on Yelp called Vic & Anthony's.  My face said \"sure!\" but I scoffed inside.  Why am I leaving our suite at Cosmopolitan, not to go downstairs to dine at STK, but to drive all the way to the business district of Vegas for...Vic & who?  My first impression was that this restaurant's decor was dated, sort of Sinatra old-school.  I scanned the room and was surprised it was full of people all seemingly in rapture with their meals.  Probably local Las Vegans whose desert-baked brains can't comprehend modern upscale dining.  I ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, no accoutrements.  Juicy.  Tender.  So good I sat up from my slouch.  I was enveloped by a wisp of humility as that savory hunk of steak yelled out to me:  IN!...YO!...FACE!  When my sweetie asked if my filet mignon was up to par with those from LA, I answered, \"It's not bad\".    Damn, I really got ripped-off at Cut.",

The reason I mention guest of the casino is because while I love an awesome lobster, this particular one is outside the range of what I'd pay for a single meal; it's I think around $120 to $130, and that's before you order drinks, apps, sides, etc. If Golden Nugget is picking up your bills though, oh mama, you better order this monster.  It's very close to a pound, post-cooked weight, so you could probably even split it if you wanted.  It's an unusual taste, kind of sweet, so completely different than what you'd get from a Maine lobster tail.  I had it twice on my last visit, saved half and turned it into breakfast the next day; simply fantastic.  As far as everything else goes; I've always been very pleased with the food and drinks here.  The place is very dimly lit but still has enough light to see some of the old Vegas memorabilia on the walls; lots of photos from days gone by.  The service has been excellent every time I've visited.  They, along with Golden Nugget, are also very accommodating to guests of the casino, so if you're a last minute kind of person, and they are full, ask your casino host to get you in and it will happen; love the service from them and Golden Nugget.  Their caprese salad is excellent; large fresh crisp tomatoes and big blocks of mozzarella with just the right amount of balsamic vinegar and basil.  Steaks; fresh and always cooked perfectly.  Their servers, and more importantly their cooks, understand how to cook a steak Pittsburgh style so don't hesitate to order it that way if that's how you like it.  Even the sides are excellent; cream corn, onion rings, etc.  There are a million steak houses in Vegas, and this is probably my number three option; good enough to go out of your way for.  Just as a point of reference, my #1 is N9NE at the Palms; their surf & turf is simply the best meal I've ever had, so it will be very hard for anywhere else to ever displace them.",

    "text": "Had another stellar meal here during a staycation at the Golden Nugget. Only the noise level and TVs in the non-separate bar stops this from being a 5* review. They are serving high end food, at big ticket prices, while food and service are top notch, it just takes away from the ambience to have patrons yelling at the NHL game during a meal, IMO. YMMV.   Our waiter started us off with cocktails and suggested the Shrimp & Crab Martini appetizer, it sounded chaotic: jumbo shrimp, crab claws and lump crab meat with kimchi slaw, plaintain chips to \"dip\" out of eponymous glass...but boy did we love it! Very unique, and a great kickoff to set the tone for the meal.   Forgoing wine for a second round, he had the filet mignon special served with truffle mashed potatoes and asparagus, savoring every bite. My twin lobster tails were perfectly executed, we shared a side of spinach which was simple and delicious. Before dinner, we (I!) decided to order the Artisan Cheese Board in lieu of dessert: it was magnificent, we battled over the accoutrements as much as the five excellent cheeses which were chosen by the Chef.   This was a superb meal, with 5* service throughout, Vic & Anthony's remains a favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, but for a quiet, romantic evening, not my first choice.   * great for group celebrations *  ** still have fantastic gynormous whole lobsters & the biggest tails (3# is not unusual ) I've seen in Las Vegas  **  *** my pics do not do the food justice, but I abhor flash photography in fine dining settings ***",

    "text": "Almost four stars, but I just couldn't pull the trigger for that.    Most importantly, the steaks are excellent!  Had the 8 ounce filet, medium, and it was cooked as requested, very good flavor, but not quite as tender as some other elite steakhouses in Las Vegas.   The sides were good, but not great.  The au gratin potatoes tasted good, but had way way too much cheese, and was also too greasy.  The onion strings were good, but nothing to write home about.   One side that did stand out was the lobster bisque.... very well balanced, and rich (that gets an A+)  The gimmicks didn't impress me, like the \"distinctive dining menu\" that had to be referenced on the website, as it wasn't included with the menu provided by the server.  Other reviews mentioned that the \"distinctive dining menu\" must be printed... I call BS on that.  When I go to a great steakhouse, I don't want to print special menus as part of some procedure before dinner!    When the server presents the bill, they also give a song and dance about some club to join to get special dining discounts.",

Whether it be a bizarre me at SLS or CarneYvino at Venetian,  This steak house is so far above the rest you can't even compare. It's almost in its own category. Chef Eric has his steak cooking method down to a T.  From the second we walked in the atmosphere; the server was so knowledgeable yet not pushy in the slightest way. The food from ...the crab cake to the Tomahawk, to the bone in filet, to the bone in ribeye, to that lobster tail was unbelievable.   I work at a steakhouse on the strip here in Vegas, but was beyond impressed tasting Chefs food. It was an unreal experience.   Crab cake- sorry but holy F@&k!!!!!!! So much crab. Big, thick, a light lemon bur blanc sauce. 5stars  Quail- enough to share for 6 ppl, the nice spice was perfect for the dish  Tar- tar make it as salty as you'd like, as it comes on a salt block.   48oz tomahawk Australian Wagu- speechless. Full of flavor. The best cut of beef I've ever had  15oz 180 dry aged Bone in filet- bucket list. Crossed off. Couldn't ask for something more worth trying.   Other guest got the bone in ribeye and the lobster tail. Both biggest steaks I've ever seen.   Dessert- biggest cheese cake ever, a chocolate cake that was as rich as some of the gamblers here in Vegas, and a bread pudding that would knock you off your feet.   To finish with the beat espresso Martini I've ever hat.   By far...  The best steakhouse in town.",

    "text": "Wow, 'nuff said!  What a marvelous dinner and equally, an experience!  As you can see from our reviews, we love eating at steakhouses and appreciate attention to detail, steak temperature, crust, cut and aging.   Vic & Anthony's delivers on all of our important criteria!  Simply said, they just deliver on all notes of a great steak.  Imagine sitting down with a great Manhattan cocktail and taking all the aromas in anticipation of what is to come.  We ordered calamar and it was the best I've ever imagined let alone eat.  I was a commercial squid fisherman and have had calamar all over the us and especially in Monterey, CA.  Just the appetizers are worth the trip.  The bone marrow is  silky, smooth and full of flavor and somehow the bread points were extra special as well.    I'm speechless as to how to review their steaks with adequate language because it was almost a spiritual experience.  With that said, the steak was perfectly marbled, cooked the right temperature and had a lovely crust.  I guess if you have not experienced a steak like this, trying to explain it is impossible.  There are a lot of steakhouses in Las Vegas but Vic & Anthony's, in the Golden Nugget, downtown is worth the Uber ride from the strip.    M-A-N-G-A!!!!! with all 5 exclamation points.",

I always order their Ginormous Lobster tail and my husband orders steak... then we share. The food and service is consistently 5 star plus. We ate there again on 8/21/19 and Jim was our waiter. Top notch is all I can say. My husband ordered the Vic's Old Fashioned for the first time after having read an article on the bartender here. He says it's the best cocktail he has ever had. So once again, Vic & Anthony's has exceeded our expectations.  I highly recommend this restaurant over any other in Las Vegas if you're wanting the best of the best.  Guys.. if you're really wanting to impress the girls, look no further. It's also one of the most romantic settings.",

The price was quite expensive but you certainly get what you pay for in this instance. HEAVEN!!!  We will definitely be back.",

We made reservations and we're quickly sat at a nice table. Very attentive waitstaff and our water glasses were never empty.   We ordered our food from their online-only \"Distinctive Dining\" menu which is a cheaper option that is only $50 per person for a 3 course meal.  If you have ever eaten here, you will know that this is an excellent deal!  We started the dinner out with the Lobster Bisque, which we always judge a good restaurant by.  This one did not disappoint!  Creamy and warm with chunks of lobster...  fantastic.  We also tried their Caesar salad which was good.  For main entrees we went with the filet and the shrimp scampi, both of which were amazing.  Buttery, garlicky shrimp and the steak was cooked to a perfect medium.  We paired these with mashed potatoes and a side of the lobster mac & cheese.  Out of this world and a must try for new diners!  Dessert came out and was a perfectly browned creme brulee.  We were so full at this point, but couldn't not finish this thing.  It was just so good.  Overall, fantastic evening with delicious food, drinks and attentive but not overbearing waiter service.  If you are looking for a fun, elegant old school dining experience, give Vic & Anthony's at the Golden Nugget a try!",

She frequented our table and was great wig helping pick out some of the best menu items.   We enjoyed a very large cheese plate that had several options of cheese and toppings. I also had the salmon stuffed crab cake. This option was MORE than enough for one to dine on, which was nice as the restaurant is quite pricey.   My meal came with a side of asparagus and potatoes. The fish was cooked just right and had a lot of flavor. The size of the fish was delightfully surprising.  It was a great portion size and the crab cake on top really set it off!  I would've LOVED to enjoy dessert but I would've probably fell over at the table. I'm really looking forward to trying this restaurant again!",

    "text": "Everything was above and beyond here! Our waiter, Matt, was very thoughtful and helpful. Our food, oh man, worth every penny.   My husband ordered the wagyu rib eye accompanied with potatoes au gratin. Holy wow! Upon delivery of his steak, he couldnt help but lean in and take in the amazing aroma. It cut like butter and melted in his mouth like a spoonful of Belgium chocolate. The potatoes au gratin were quite literally the most cheesiest, seasoned, blend of perfection to accompany his \"Man Dinner\". Let's face it, what guy isn't in love with a good steak and potato dinner.  He paired his meal with a fresh and crisp IPA \"top of the world\".  I am a crab lover. It's quite literally my favorite food. I had every intention of ordering the king crab, until Matt described the surf and turf special. An 8oz filet mignon with sage/garlic butter melted over the top, a 6 oz Australian lobster tail simply brushed with butter, seasoned haricots vert (green beans) and fingerling potatoes. My mind was effectively changed and I'm so glad it was! My steak was so tender and flavorful. My lobster, sweet and delightful, my green beans, cooked perfectly and the potatoes,  well, they were overshadowed by everything else, but still very tasty. Lol.   We decided on a dessert, it was our anniversary dinner, after all. We chose the \"in the globe\". Its basically a hollow sphere of chocolate hiding within itself a bananas foster gift from the gods. They finish it at the table by pouring a banana liquor sauce onto the globe which then melts it open to reveal the gift within. It's quite the little show, so have your camera ready!  Dinner for the 2 of us was $233. It was expensive, but it was definitely a whole experience that every one should treat themselves to at least once.   The ONLY thing I was disappointed by was that I had told them it was our anniversary at the time I made our reservation and the service hostess said she would make a note and let them know. However, nothing was ever said. I should have mentioned it again, but my husband isnt the guy that likes a spectacle to be made. I let it go, but regret it. I would have liked to have seen what they would have done as a \"special extra\".",

We sat at their bar and ordered some of their amazing appetizers. So we end up ordering the following:  Crab cake was recommended by our bar tender and it was really packed with real crab meat and the breading was so light that you can taste that they did not use some fillers inside. Its loaded with crab meat, yum!  My second favorite was their Pork Belly---I just love it.   Calamari was good but I'm not a fan of the sweet sauce. I'd rather have it plain with shishito peppers. Next time I'll ask them, no sauce.   I had a great time, the bartenders even if they are almost closing they keep interacting with us while finishing their side works.",

    "text": "This is a regular stop for us even though we never actually stay at the Golden Nugget.  I also realize that there are more fine dining steak and chop houses in Las Vegas than seemingly anywhere else on the planet.  I mean the choices are so infinite that just picking the right place is almost a joke.  So let me give you my best shot at why we enjoy this particular location...  1. The food--So we are never disappointed at the quality of the steaks, seafood and sides.  Steaks are always cooked perfectly and the seafood choices have always been prepared perfectly and if you have non steak eaters with you they will be happy.  I love the brussel sprouts and I am a semi expert in their preparation.  The lobster mac and cheese are worth the trip downtown and we also love the duck fat fries and all of the other vegetables (hungry now that I am typing this)  2. Service--great service makes all food that much better for me so I could give them a 6 instead of a 5 because we are always and I mean alway well taken care of.  More than one person keeps on eye on things and like all cool, older places the wait staff are always long time employees that know and care about your experience.    3.  I love getting off the strip and a trip downtown is always fun for a change of scenery and a bit of straight up crazy.  UBER is $7-15 from just about anywhere on the strip with no waiting so I don't even have to drive.    This place won't disappoint so do yourself a favor and try it out!",

Furthermore no GM came by to check in so I couldn't even comment on the servers dismissive attitude and let the make it right.   Ambiance is average, nothing too eye catching.  Drinks were perfect pours- I had a Gin and Tonic martini of some sort with a special tonic- it was amazing.   Food- All of the appetizers were yummy Calamari and the Oysters were some of the best I've ever had. The Mac n cheese never disappoints, along with the duck fat potatoes and Mac n cheese.   Service- our Server seemed annoyed though I have no clue why. He forgot to Add the Cajun to my steak even though I ordered it that way and didn't offer to fix it after I asked him if he forgot it which he said he did. I don't really like ribeye unless it's Cajun so I would have ordered something else if I knew he was going to forget. Disappointed for a $60 steak.   Our bill was about $700 for a party of 6 which is reasonable since we ate like kings and had1-2 cocktails each.",

Not coincidentally, Thanksgiving 2018 found us at the Golden Nugget with reservations at this steakhouse with no intention of ordering anything turkey related and, considering that steaks & cocktails have no known consumption limit (or so I've been told), we heeded the call for cattle.  We enjoyed pre-dinner cocktails and then our prime grade steaks of filet mignon on the bone, rib eye, plus a shared appetizer of brussel sprouts (with bacon). This was more than enough to satisfy our appetites, but not so much that we couldn't enjoy casino fun afterwards.  The restaurant is nice, very dark & romantic, and provides top quality food and service. Expect to pay good money, but if you charge it to your room bill, it almost feels like you got it comped.",

    "text": "In my opinion, this is one of the best steakhouses as well as restaurants in Las Vegas. When you walk in, you see the display of different types of steaks to your left. And when you enter the dining area, it feels like a 50s classy restaurant with grandeur, luxury and happiness. Then, the lighting, the waiters outfits and the decor feels like a 1930s atmosphere. So it's set up like the 50s but blends with 30s elements...so awesome. Now on to the food, the crab cake is definitely small but you won't be disappointed; the texture is perfect. The Colorado lamb chops is not the best I have had. I have had better like when the Alize was still open at the Palms. But still decent. But the lobster filet special was my favorite. The lobster is cut perfectly. When I eat the lobster there is no blandness (which tends to happen to large seafood pieces) but one long tail of heaven. As for the filet mignon, I had it medium rare, and every slice I made was the correct ratio of raw to cooked. There's just too many things I like this place including the great service. Check it out yourself to see it.",

Those looking for a cheap experience or fast meal, this isn't the place for you.  Linen napkins, Crystal water goblets, formal dining settings, uniformed staff, are all items you will experience.  Songs sung by the Rat Pack, plays softly in the background in a darkened room, helps to add to the ambience.  (Rat Pack was a group of singers from the 50's.  Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin & Sammy Davis Jr were the more well-known members.). The Filet Mignon was cooked to perfection with a side of Au Gratin mashed potatoes.  The Salmon with capers was flavorful and moist.  The 3 scoop Gelato was a wonderful finish to our meal.  I noticed they had a full bar and large selection of wines.  The service was exceptional with the servers & bus boys appearing without having to hunt for them.  It was an enjoyable dinner & we will be back.  Btw for fellow Yelpers who belong to the Landry Select Club, don't forget to show them your card before paying the bill.  For those who aren't members, it's a good $25 investment!",

    "text": "Fancy schmancy. I came here with a bunch of friends in order to celebrate a bachelor party (party of 11). They were very accommodating and gave us a private room in the rear of the restaurant. We started off with some appetizers, fresh oysters and calamari with sweet and spicy peppers. By far the freshest oysters I've ever had. Very good, and I'm not even a big oyster fan. The calamari was interesting, served on a bed of sweet/sour sauce with peppers. I'm accustomed to eating calamari with a marinara or garlic-lemon mayonnaise sauce but this was a nice change. Onto the steaks; we got:  On the bone prime ribeye. A solid steak that you can't go wrong with. Flavorful and juicy, mine could have actually used a bit more char on the outside; the inside was impeccable with just the right amount of warm red in the center.  On the bone Prime Porterhouse. I only had a bite from one of my friend's steak and it was impeccable. Perfect amount of char and red center.  Tomahawk chop, a 40 oz monstrosity of a steak. The outside was a bit more charred than we were expecting but the inside was still succulent. Really, you're only ordering this just to say that you ordered this.  Overall, 4 solid stars. The food was great, but nothing wow'd me to warrant a 5 star rating. It felt like your typical high end steakhouse, but nothing to really set it apart from other places. Located in the Golden Nugget Hotel, so valet. Or uber.",

    "text": "Our experience here was that of an average steak house, comparable to Ruth's Chris. Except Ruth's Chris has better calamari. Sorry.  Maybe it was the high expectations from the raving reviews, maybe people who reviewed have been to the Outback too many times, I don't know, but Vic & Anthony's, while good, didn't stand out at all.  Like a good steakhouse, they're going to give you a black napkin if you have black pants on. They're going to put it on your lap for you. They're going to expect you to use your forks and knives in the right order and take them away as the courses progress. The steaks are going to be about $30-$50 bucks. You're going to order sides to share. Your steak is going to be served on a hot plate and they're going to tell you to cut it in half to make sure it's served correctly. It's going to taste well seasoned and melt in your mouth.  This.... I can get anywhere. So is there anything else that makes me want to come here rather than any other steak house? No.  The only note of originality here is that the wedge salad is huge (too big, really). The Prime Ribeye is also A LOT OF MEAT.   The Au Gratin potatoes are covered in a Velveeta-like cheese that sticks to your mouth and sits like a rock in your stomach. Not in a good way.  They have a good wine list and I recommend the Cab/Syrah wine by the glass if you're leaning in that direction.  Still giving it four stars because there's nothing to really complain about... the food was good, the service was boring but standard... there's just nothing to rave about. For $150 bucks we were pretty well fed, but I'd rather have spent it somewhere else.",

    "text": "Service here is on point. Seriously. From the water and bread refills to the waiter inconspicuously asking one of the guys helping at the table to get an extra plate (what ARE they called?), these guys are on point.  The food didn't blow me away, but it was solid.   The sourdough bread that kept on coming out had a nice crunch with a soft interior and was served with a whipped butter.  Chopped salad was just a chopped salad - nothing special there.   When all our dishes came out, our server immediately asked us all to check the temperature of our meat to make sure it was ok. Mine was not, and he profusely apologized for it and took it back immediately to correct the temperature. Definitely have not seen this done before. (But then again, I haven't been to THAT many steak houses).   I had the veal chop which was good, and tasted like pork chop, but I kind of wish I just stuck with a regular steak to get that meaty taste. The bites of steak I did have from the other people in my party had a nice salt/pepper exterior with a nice crunch and was really flavorful.  As far as sides go, the mushrooms were good, but a bit too seasoned (marinating in something balsamic for too long?), asparagus was good, potato au gratin was exceptional, as well as the creamed corn.   Would recommend coming to this restaurant. It was also a nice surprise to check out the Golden Nugget. Who knew that it would look so fancy inside! I'm always on the strip, and this was my first venture to downtown Vegas",

My steak came out and one bite proved so extremely salty that my wife (who digs salt) could't eat it and recommended that I wipe off the seasoning from the 21-oz masterpiece before me. After summoning the waiter and letting him know that I really couldn't actually eat the awesome cut of New York goodness that had been placed before me he disappeared immediately and I enjoyed some of the entrees that had landed in the meantime. Our waiter was fantastic. Nice moustache. Great care for the patrons. He came back out with the maitre'd and a totally clean unseasoned and perfectly medium rare masterpiece of a NY. Probably pushing 3lb to be honest. I ordered more wine for the table and made sure the waiter was taken care of. Here is my guidance to the establishment: Almost everything was over seasoned that night. I don't know if that's typical. The vegetables, particularly the beet salad, were perfect. If you could arrange to have a restroom that was in your own space and not in the casino that would be helpful. I would eat there again in a heartbeat even though I had to send my steak back the first time around.",

Since the wife and I were staying in the nugget, we decided to keep it local and try Vic's.     I have nothing but positive things to say about the evening.  The food was near transcendent.  I opted for the bone in rib-eye,while the lady chose seafood.  The steak literally melted in my mouth, while the side of Au Gratin potatoes served as a welcome compliment to the meal.  The wife raved about her salmon as we also slowly enjoyed a recommended bottle of bubbly.    Service was beyond amazing and the atmosphere was beyond comfortable during the entire dining experience which is important for a Vegas fine dining rookie like myself.

However, the giant aquarium nearby (with a tube for bathers to slide thru among the sharks) makes for a pretty entertaining place to wait. And, in fairness, once we got seated, it didn't seem like there were empty tables.  Once we were seated the service could not have been better. Our waitress struck the right balance between friendly and intrusively friendly. There were always assistant wait staff to fill water glasses and take plates away. One never had to look for the waitress for help with some item. I liked that our waitress told us the specials and the prices. I don't like to ask what the price is but I do like to know. I was a little annoyed that some of the menu items were \"market price.\"  The complimentary hot bread was not really great; it usually isn't in Las Vegas.  I had the salmon which turned out to be the value meal as well as the allegedly heart healthy one. It was $29 and came on a bed of mashed potatoes, and with three big asparagus spears cooked just right, along with some diced tomatoes and capers.  My wife had the 16 ounce prime rib eye steak at $46 by itself. I had one bite and had to admit that it was delicious. It was rare with a charred surfaces. I avoid charred meat out a concern that it might be unhealthy, but it sure tasted good. She also got a monster $9 baked potato that was shared.   One of my sons had the $10 roasted beet salad as an appetizer which we passed around. It was impressively good. Another had the pepper crusted tuna which was a generous portion at $36.  I would have preferred slightly softer music.   It was a tough decision whether to give this a four or five star rating. I think you can expect consistently good service and food, albeit it pricey.",

    "text": "The bone-in ribeye had the best flavor and texture of steak I have ever had. Being a native Houstonian, I've had my share of steak! I ordered my ribeye medium rare (which at Vic & Anthony's is nice and pink) and it literally melted in my mouth. I hardly had to chew--it just melted! The steak cuts like a tender piece of meat, but when it hits your mouth is it truly similar to the texture of butter. Unbelievable. I never quite understood what people meant by comparing foods to butter, until I tasted Vic & Anthony's steaks. The meat isn't overly seasoned or overly salted---its a perfect balance (maybe just a dash of salt and pepper) with a quality cut of meat. When you taste a steak from Vic & Anthony's, you are tasting the meat in its best form--not covered up with a bunch of spices and seasonings. Simplicity at its finest!  Be careful though---once you eat there, you'll have risen the bar so high on good eats, that you may have a hard time tolerating food from other Las Vegas eateries. No matter where we went, nothing we ordered compared to the experience of our Vic & Anthony's meal.   The asparagus and the mushrooms were wonderful accompaniments. The asparagus was medium-sized, lightly seasoned and al dente. The mushrooms tasted like they were tossed in a wine sauce of some sort. Served sauteed and whole, these mushrooms were firm and absolutely delicious! A fun appetizer to order is the steak tartare. Delicate and whimsical, the steak tartare is served with a mildly spicy ground mustard, chips and an egg yolk in the center (which becomes like a rich sauce when you break it open). A slab of salt that resembled marble was used as a platter for this appetizer, which added some light salty flavor and lots of fun to this dish.   The decor inside Vic & Anthony's is dim, warm, soothing and elegant--as is the music playing in the background. Be sure to check out the photography on the walls, as they are all tributes to Las Vegas history. Beautiful restaurant, and excellent food. You are making a huge mistake if you miss out on Vic & Anthony's!",

Our steaks could have been cut with our forks; tender and well seasoned.   Their wine list is extensive and the entire experience was over the top.   We were even comp'd dessert for our anniversary.   The dinner, no alcohol, was $150+ tip. While pricey, very well worth it.",

Extremely flavorful and the crab cakes was majority crab.   The steak was cooked to a perfect med-rare and extremely flavorful. My wife doesn't like steaks but enjoyed it very much. Her fish was absolutely amazing as well. The skin was crispy and full of flavor while the salmon itself was very soft. I wasn't too crazy about the potatoes gratin cause it tasted like Kraft Cheese.  For dessert we ordered the croissant bread pudding and it was sooo good. Surprisingly it wasn't that sweet and we pretty much cleaned that out.  We will definitely come back here.",

Yes, you read it correctly, \"Orgasmic.\" If I had to describe his experience any further, my post would probably be flagged.   I, for one, am not about pass on such an experience, booked the reservation on Christmas eve when I knew we were going to be in  Vegas.   After dinning there, it was a bit of a let down.  Let me preface that the steaks were good: Just as good as any other $50 steak place. I mean, a steak house ruining steak, that's just blasphemous. However, it just was not the best I've ever had -- that's what she said.  (See what I did there. Following on the sexual theme. Ha ha.)  Service was attentive, and they displayed the steaks tartare on a cool salt slab; one you can buy for 45 bucks!   My husband agreed that it was not like Houston's. I guess the Texans just know how to cook their steaks. If I were ever in Houston, I would give this another try.",

    "text": "My wife, brother, cousin and I decided on this restaurant after the great reviews. We were planning on watching a show over at The Smith Center and wanted to eat somewhere within close proximity. I would not be dissappointed in our choice. First we were greated very warmly and seated right away. I would recommend making a reservation and you could easily do that on their website. The atmosphere was very warm with all the dark wood features. On to the service and dishes. The service was impeccable. My ice tea actually was filled with ice and I continued to get ice tea AND ice throughout the dinner! Perfect. Most of the time at other restaurants I get a glass with 5 cubes of ice that melt by the middle if the dinner and unless you ask for extra ice your not going to get it. It's the big things that count but all the little things count just as much. Also the wait staff was very friendly and welcoming. The dishes we had were the best I had in awhile. We had the calamari in which the caramelized onions were delicious! I had the seared tuna which I cannot even begin to describe. The dish was just amazing. The tuna melted in my mouth. Unbelievable. If you love sushi you will love this dish. My wife had the shrimp scampi which she loved. My brother had the prime rib eye which he stated was cooked to perfection and my cousin had the pork chops that were cooked just right. I have to say that previously we ate at the steakhouse inside the sunset station and I would most definitely have paid a little more to eat at Vic and Anthony's. Don't pass up the opportunity to eat here. I would probably compare the quality of food to when my wife and I ate at BOA Steakhouse about 3 years ago. Happy Dining!",

It's very pricey but not outrageously so considering where you are and what you expect to get.  Now onto the food. Which is what really matters when separating a steak house from a really great steakhouse.  We started out with the calamari with peppers. It was good, interesting flavor with a touch of heat. We also had the chips and strings which are exactly that. Homemade potato chips and onion string served with ketchup. Nothing special that would make me get it again.  The specials include a 27oz dry aged \"Cowboy\" ribeye steak for $149. Considering that the 16 oz ribeye was $48 we didn't bite. Dry aged steak is great but not at those prices and the big bone , the cowboy part, is nothing more than a gimmick adds nothing to the food.  The sides we ordered included the brussel sprouts, wild mushrooms, baked potato and mashed potatoes.  All tasty and overpriced but while in a \"premium\" steakhouse not unusual.  Now for the steak. I ordered the prime ribeye. Cooked exactly as I ordered it, so kudos to the cook. Unfortunately I've had a better piece of meat from Costco. It was not seasoned very well, if at all. The meat itself was tender but not what you would expect from a prime steak.    My wife had the lobster mac and cheese which she liked. The lobster tail is lightly breaded and fried. The cheese sauce was light and tasty. A good entree.  Overall not bad but there is certainly better places to spend your money for a premium steak.",

    "text": "Starting off this is a typical US Prime Beef cooked with a Salamander steakhouse, If you been to Ruth Chris or Mortons in other cities, you know the drill here.  This is probably one of the best nice dining spots in downtown.  Starting off, on a busy Friday night with no reservations we were seated in about 40 minutes, which isn't bad considering we had no reservations. Instead of going to the in house bar to wait, we went to the casino cocktail lounge around the the corner and watched the shark tank and sports updates until we were called by the hostess for our seats.  The venue is dark, classic steak house, it was busy, but it was also very private, as someone stated before, there are many restaurants which has a fishbowl effect with people gawking at you while dining, its not the case here. I've seen a few local celebrities here while dining. A good spot if you want to keep a low profile.  The service was top notch. Our drinks were refreshed regularly, the staff was friendly and the courses were served in a timely fashion.  Pricing is appropriate for a US prime steakhouse with market prices for beef and seafood. We never had any of the seafood so the review is focusing on the steak.  Started off with cocktails and the bread roll which was very nice, soft and warm with whipped butter and a crispy crust.  Followed that up with a Cesar salad and chili, the salad was ok, with a nice balance between tart and creamy. The chef special soup for that day was a prime beef chili which was horrible. They added sugar and what seamed to be off the shelf chili powder.. it wasn't much better than the stuff you get out of the can which is really unfortunate.  The main entrees were cooked properly, nice well marbled beef with our table having steaks cooked from rare to medium, it has the buttery flavor you often see with the Salamander prepared steaks.  The sides we had was Brussels sprouts, the potatoes au gratin, mash potatoes, asparagus and creamed spinach. All were excellent speaking from a standpoint that I hate brussel sprouts generally. The au gratin potatoes was loaded with cheese so expect a fair bit of grease.  We skipped dessert.   It's a nice option to have in downtown vegas, I'll be back again.",

    "text": "Steak so good make you wanna slap yo' momma! Lol no but seriously this place is FANTASTIC! Ate here for the mother's day dinner and I must say that they have some of the BEST customer service I've received from a steakhouse! I originally booked my reservation online on the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a> website because of the cool perks of dinning perks! Reservation was for 5:15 PM. We arrived a little early but no problem because we were seated promptly at 5:15! The ambiance in this place is remarkable we were sat upstairs in this more private seating area! What a plus that was because of the privacy and sharing the special Mother's Day occasion. Let's get to the food, oh but before I start let me tell you that the \"Mojito 23\" drink that they have on the special drink menu is terrible, if you are a regular mojito drinker like myself take my word for it, it's horrible. The main food course we ordered were mainly the Surf & Turf specials which originally came with an 8oz Filet Mignon however my brother and I upgraded our steaks to a 22OZ Bone-In-Ribeye which btw is TO DIE FOR. We added this blue cheese butter to the steak that made it mouthwatering! The lobsters that came with these orders were cooked to perfection and nice with the butter sauce. Sometimes places can over cook the lobster which makes it tough but this defiantly wasn't the case, they nailed this whole entree! The macaroni and cheese we ordered was horrible, put it like this we could have saved that $8.95 and went to Wal-mart and bought a box of Velveeta that would have been more worthwhile! Pass on that side dish FOR SURE! Over all other than the 2 minuses on the Mojito 23 and the macaroni and cheese I'll give this place a 4.5 stars! Will return for sure!",

    "text": "Located inside the Golden Nugget in Downtown Las Vegas, Vic & Anthony's is a place I'd been wanting to visit for a long time but never got around to it. Finally, while in town for meetings, I suggested it to a coworker and he agreed. So we met downtown and gave it a shot.    The atmosphere is upscale and upbeat yet relaxing. Dark cherry wood, low lighting, open spaces but with an air of privacy. There is also a bar with eight seats and I noticed there were always a couple open. There were two servers/bartenders back there which is one for every four seats. Not bad.  We were fortunate enough to get in without reservations, but I highly recommend making them. It was a Tuesday night for us so not too crowded but I'd never try walking in like that during the weekend. Unless maybe you want to dine at the bar.  I ordered the Prime Ribeye and added some Mac & Cheese. Both were absolute five star dishes. I can't say enough about them. Outstanding. One of the best steaks I've encountered on the earth thus far. The Mac & Cheese was amazing in it's own right, baked just right with the perfect combination of taste and texture. Not salty at all, like many restaurants make it.   The service was beyond courteous and professional. I'd give it six stars. Everyone there clearly wants you happy and wants you to come back. The staff combined with the pleasant atmosphere made us want to hang out a little longer than we usually would. So we did.   Of course, when I go out something a little odd has to happen to me. Tonight was no different. A guy at a nearby table ordered a side of broccoli and these two HUGE broccoli florets come out on a plate. He's shocked (and a little hammered) and starts walking around other tables with his plate begging people to take a slice of his broccoli. When he got to us, we politely declined and he was a little indignant and said: \"What's wrong with you people, don't nobody like broccoli?\"  Finding no takers, he sat back down at his table with the two trees still on his plate and went at it alone.   Dinner and a show.   This is a somewhat upscale place but I noticed a few patrons in shorts. I wouldn't recommend it because Vic's calls for better than that. I personally wouldn't wear them because, in this dark environment, I'm afraid my legs would glow in the dark and be the spectacle of the evening. Even more than that broccoli guy. No, I wore some dark jeans with some way cool dress shoes and a long-sleeved polo and fit in just fine.   This is a must visit if you're downtown and looking for the right place to dine. Don't wait years like I did to try Vic & Anthony's. It is a supreme steakhouse.",

The sommelier? Spot on. His knowledge? Impressive. 3 yrs ago we ordered just a bottle of wine, a baked potato (split), a bottle of 2006 J Davies cab (rare treat), perfect. Today we ordered the works.. Including an impeccable bottle of wine a cab from Lodi that tasted appropriately like a Zin (Lodi being renowned for such).. And no surprise the best parts of the dinner were the steak and the wine. As tempting as they sides sound- skip them.. You won't be disappointed.  Coodos to the very impressive and knowledgeable wait staff.. Professional over the top.",

    "text": "Special thanks to Chef Rodriguez for his gracious hosptality and most wonderful meal. @Vic_n_Anthonys steakhouse located in downtown #Vegas' newly renovated Gold tower at the @GoldenNuggetLV Hotel & Casino   We had a reservation for 7pm and were seated immediately. The dining room was very elegant with beautiful stained glass ceiling, formal settings with low mood lighting.   The waiter came out promptly introducing himself and welcoming us with a full description of the evenings menu and specials that were currently being offered. The evenings specials were the Lobster live from the tanks and Kobe steak heated to liking on a hot salt tablet prepared tableside VERY COOL!!   We ordered drinks a couple apps and a steak dinner and a couple desserts.   The apps came out quickly-a crab cake like NO other. light and crispy full of crab covered in crab with a sauce I'm not sophisticated enough to describe but the fact I DO NOT eat seafood and I licked the plate clean here says it ALL!! WOW!!   The other appetizer Maple Glazed Quail was alot like chicken drumettes but lighter tastier with a wonderful combination of greens+tomatoes with another indesribeable sauce:) YUM   What a way to get started!!! We could hardly wait to try the steak. 16oz prime strip cooked medium-rare:) and of course a baked potato loaded with butter&sour cream!! Thats me Mr Meat & Potatoes;)   BEST STEAK EVER!!! I have only been to a handful of places that even offer steaks costing more than $20 so I have limited experience here but this was by far and away the best steak I have EVER had. Melt in your mouth delicious!! Oh and the potato wasn't bad either lol :)   After this amazing meal -Chef Rodriguez came out to thank us for coming in and then we talked about his visits to some of the #Vegas restaurants he had visited during his stay concluding there's so much to discover and it's such a fun and tasty adventure.   To our surprise the Chef presented us dessert--Cheesecake with blueberries and sauce and croissant bread pudding w/ice cream and lots of lil extras that just took it over the TOP:)   The desserts were GREAT but after taking home the bread pudding and trying it the NEXT day it seemed even BETTER   What a wonderful dining experience-pleasant atmosphere, truly fantastic personal service, and the food was to die for. I would recommend it to EVERYONE and if you are on Death Row(Texas reference) and have to select your LAST MEAl-If you wanna feel that feeling like you've REALLY lived now-ORDER it from Vic & Anthony's!!",

    "text": "Vic & Anthony's has been our go to steak house for many years. Even before we moved to Vegas. However, our experience last Saturday night was somewhat disappointing and has left us wondering if things have changed. First, the good. As always the drinks and service were top notch. Our server Jay was on top of not only the menu but also the specials and recommendations for accompanying wines and desert options. The food on the other hand was another story. We've been here many times so we have a good idea of what to expect. Steaks, while cooked to order, came out an unappetizing grey on a barren plate. No exterior char whatsoever as in the past. The once reliable potatoes au gratin have morphed from very good into a disappointing way over salted stew of gooey oily cheese that had the consistency of Velveeta. The creamed spinach, while tasty, suffered from the same over salted treatment. Really unacceptable for dinners that can easily exceed $100 per person. We're hoping that what we experienced was an aberration and will probably be give V&As another chance but they need to be aware long term customers have a lot of choices in this market and need to feel that they're getting their moneys worth.",

    "text": "Me and my wife  went to the Vic and Anthony steakhouse in Texas and it was one the the best in the country for steak. Had a great experience.  We got dressed up and did the whole 9 yard. So for our anniversary  we travel to Vegas . We figured hey it's a little pricey but what the heck. Let's go for it and splurge.  We both got dressed nice. Her in a fine black cocktail dress. Myself in a sport blazer,pants and a headdress. Recently I have be wearing my hair long so it keeps it nice and neat, tied back and out of my face. We were staying at Bellagio and wore something very similar to Picasso for dinner the night before. Not a single problem there.  And was treated with the utmost respect and services.  Not at Vic and Anthony steakhouse Vegas. Don't worry we will get to the food very shortly. The hostess sat us down and asked me to remove my hat in the dining room.  I told her it's not a hat it's a headdress.  She walked away.  Than the waiter came to take our order and asked, \"Would the gentleman kindly remove your hat?\" I told him it was not a hat and this gentleman would like not to be asked again.  Than the manager came and as me to remove it. I told him that this headdress is culturally accept around the world and is also used by many religious group and can be very offensive if asked to be removed.  He looked at me like I drew the race card on him. I noticed how the whole senerio was making the evening unpleasant for my wife so I reluctant removed it. Than we noticed a older man in jeans and a cowboy had behinds us. To the right of us a group of people in shorts and t shirts.  You know the ones with the US flag on it. The food was  2nd rate. But the service was awful.  Never have I been made to feel so uncomfortable in a restaurant before. As we sat there I noticed one more thing. The only minority present was me.",

If you want a memorable wine experience, enlist the help of the sommelier. This wonderful French gentleman picked a lovely French Chablis and Bordeaux-like Napa blend for our meal. I described our tastes (oenophile sister to Merlot Mom) and he delivered selections that exceeded our taste buds.    I ordered from the Prix Fixe menu and was a fan of the Haricot Verts. Wonderful!! Filet was ordered medium-rare but was pretty rare... too rare for me. The waiter did warn us. Creme Brulee comes in a flat dish  vs. ramekin so you get more burnt sugar than flan. My sister had the Oysters Rockerfeller and it was tasty. I ordered the bacon appetizer and yes, it tasted like a sweet bacon dish. I was expecting more of a Pork Belly phenom.   There were 7 of us for a family reunion and the reservationist delivered what I asked... a quiet area so my hard-of-hearing dad could hear the conversations over the dinner din. Bravo and Thank you! Great experience.   CON: restrooms are in the casino -- quite a walk and not a direct route.",

    "text": "They have some nice big boody over here: I'm talking about lobster tail....  Around Freemont there are many advertisements for $12 to $15 steak meals; I passed on those cheap deals for this place. The taxi driver and two different store clerks said that this is the best restaurant on Freemont.  They were right.  What I liked: The damn Filet Mignon that I've had!  It was so tender - it was almost tender like fish (I always order rare).  It was perfectly paired with the Peppercorn Steak Sauce.  If they sold it in a bottle, I'd buy it. The service was very friendly. The environment was classy, laidback, and filled with jazz music. The prices are far more reasonable than the prices on the main Las Vegas strip!  (The filet was around $40 something)  What could have been better? The Oyster Rockefeller had large juicy oysters, but was overall OK: too much cheese and spinach for my taste.  The chopped salad was nice but not outstanding.  Other notes: I want to return and try the FREAKIN HUGE Australian Rock Lobster tails (they are on display).  It was the largest lobster tail that I've seen in person for sure.  BTW: The people who referred me to this restaurant just called it \"the restaurant at the Golden Nugget.\"    So definitely try the outstanding steak + peppercorn sauce and check out that lobster booty.",

The wine list was great and the service was awesome. The waiter went above and beyond for our party and brought out a dessert sampler that was amazing!

    "text": "I've eaten a lot of steak in this town, more than I should.  But what a delightful surprise this restaurant was.  Mother in law was in town a few weeks ago, and we were running late to the Gordie Brown show.  Originally we were going to try the steakhouse at the El Cortez, because I had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate, but we took so long showing her the strip we just didn't have time to go there before the show.  So we came here instead, because we could have a quick meal in the same casino.  We were seated right away, without reservations.  My mother in law and my husband had the fillet, and I had the ribeye.  They had a really nice surf and turf going on that night and I should have ordered that, but for some reason the ribeye was calling me, even though I mostly order fillet.  I guess I didn't want to copy everyone at the table.  We also ordered lobster bisque, caesar salad, and the potatoes gratin, spinach, and asparagus.  I have never seen my mother in law get excited about anything we have eaten, in Las Vegas or anywhere else.  Mostly when we go out to eat, she constantly complains about the expensive price of restaurants outside of Montana, and acts like she is mad we went out instead of cooking.  She did have a fit at first about eating here looking at the prices, but after tasting her food she loudly exclaimed \"oh my god, this is so good,\" and shut up about how much it costs.  But this is a woman who grew up on a farm mostly in poverty and worked for the government her entire career, raising my wonderful husband alone, so I cannot be mad at her attitude about it.  I try to take her occasionally to nice places because, well, she deserves it.  Every steakhouse in town I have eaten at always has something not executed correctly, or the quality of food isn't that great.  This literally was the most perfect steakhouse meal I have had.  The meat was so flavorful that my husband still dreams about it, and was executed with the right amount of char that we love at the perfect temperature.  Sides were so perfect and good they could not have been better.  Lobster bisque had lots of nice chunks of lobster in it.  I'm not sure why Carnevino and Cut and some of the other steakhouses are considered the best in town, but this really blew everything I have eaten away, including CraftSteak which was garbage compared to this meal.  Maybe I will try Carnevino and Cut next just to compare!",

    "text": "This meal was a HUGE disappointment. The Prime Ribeye was tough (Cooked medium). Really tough. I saw no sign of being well marbled, and it was like a steak off of an outdoor barbecue where the person buying the meat and cooking had no idea what they were doing. The side dishes of creamed corn, sauteed mushrooms, and duck fat potatoes were all mediocre at best. The creamed corn had no taste of 'creaminess', like I experienced of other 'fine dining' restaurants. Really. The corn had crunch to it, and the cream was mostly non-existent. The mushrooms were REALLY chewy. Mushrooms should not be mushy, but should definitely not be chewy. The duck fat potatoes were like home fries cooked with bacon fat. Not horrible, but something I'd expect from a breakfast house. I can't overstate the steak though. Tough, not tender, massive disappointment. This restaurant lives on it's reputation, like a lot of Vegas restaurants. I would not return to dine there. No chance.",

I really don't understand the hype.  I think a chain restaurant like Ruth Chris's or Capital Grille really is a lot better than this place.  I ordered the special which was a filet with a little lobster tail on top that was supposed to have a vanilla type cream on top of that with a little pile of sauteed wild mushrooms on the side and some asparagus.  All of this was sitting on a small puree of something or other.  Parmesan polenta maybe?  It took a while to get to the table and mine was completely tepid in temperature.  The whole plate - not just one item.  Here's the kicker.  They didn't reflame anything, they just put it in the microwave.  YUCK!  How can one tell this?  The color of the filet went from brown to gray.  What was I going to do at that point?  Send it all back and have them remake it all?  No.  We just won't go back, so big deal.  The flow of the restaurant is awful..  I get it, more table and chairs, more people = more money.  But for a place that has been around this long, shouldn't they know by now comfort for both servers and patrons really makes for happy faces everywhere in the restaurant?",

We had the ribeye. The best part of the meal was the salmon, which was very good. The seating is not appropriate for the prices charged. They are few \"private\" tables, and we shared a bench, with a large party (8 or so.) Not ideal for a special birthday dinner. One appetizer, one salad, and two entrees - no alcohol, and the bill was 160.00 - too much for the quality. There are too many other really nice restaurants in Vegas, to go back here. Sorry, I really hoped this was going to be a better review.",

I was in Vegas for the weekend (go figure) and one of my friends said he has heard rave reviews about Vic & Anthony's, however once I heard it was in Downtown Vegas at the Nugget I questioned how good would it be? Afterall I am not really a downtown Vegas type of guy but the other guys wanted to check it out so I went along. Decor is your typical dark wood and paneling steakhouse with lots of old photos on the walls, nothing too spectacular. The food on the other hand was very very good. everyone ordered a different cut of meat from a petite fillet to a huge bone-in rib eye, each with different preparation and temp from rare to medium well and everyone's food came out to their liking. Prices are not bad at all especially when copared to steakhouses on the strip. Now if you are on a budget this is a great place to eat some great food but don't forget to factor in a cab or limo ride fromt he strip to downtown. If you are staying downtown then for sure give it a shot.",

Two people in our party tried, for twenty minutes to get a second drink.  When the entrees (mostly steaks) were served, they looked like little brown islands in the middle of a huge white sea (large plates).  Part of a fine dining experience is eating with our eyes.  A little garnish, or smear of color on the plate would have enhanced its appearance. Five of the entrees came pretty close together, and the 6th was several minutes behind... NOT GOOD!  Several minutes later the potatoes, and other side dishes were served.  We were halfway through our entrees when the sides arrived. This is not the kind of service one expects at a $75-$100. a plate restaurant!  I have been at inexpensive casual restaurants that send the food out with several servers at the same time, so that the meal can be enjoyed as ordered.  Don't know if they were short handed on a Wednesday night, but that problem should not be extended to the customer!",

If you're staying on the Strip, it's a good 15-20 minute drive, but worth it. The service was great, not too pushy, around at just the right times, and our server (Mike) made great suggestions. It's expensive (for my budget), but I knew that going in, so it wasn't a shock to me. They were kind enough to split our salad and baked potato without even requesting them to do so. I had the filet and my husband had the strip. Both were cooked perfectly and the filet had a nice char on the outside, but was very tender on the inside. I would highly recommend for a date night, Birthday, or some other special celebration. I would return in my next Vegas trip!",

    "text": "God, what a terrible experience. It started when we arrived for our dinner reservation and there's no hostess/greeter in sight for over 10 mins. Finally the manager comes and seats us in between 2 squished tables when the entire restaurant is empty. I don't need to be secluded or anything but i certainly don't want to be squeezed in between 2 other tables when there's clearly room elsewhere. Some of the items on the menu are a hit or miss. They need to clearly state proper ingredients on the menu for certain dishes. For example we ordered the calamari thinking it's your basic calamari with marinara & aioli for dipping. However the calamari came out tossed in a sweet tangy sauce with a TON of onions. The sauce I don't mind too much but my boyfriend does not eat onions so it's definitely something they should've mentioned on the menu so that we could've asked for the dish without onions. We also ordered the Szechuan peppered tuna dish and it came out looking like sashimi. There was wasabi & ginger to pair with the tuna but no sauce/soy sauce. It was weird. Our waitress didn't ask if we were done with our appetizers, she just came and cleared our table when we clearly were not finished with some of the dishes. The manager was so rude and made us feel uncomfortable throughout our entire dinner. My boyfriend didn't like how they put butter on his plate and asked for a regular plate instead and after that request the manager literally stood next to our table and stared at us for a good 15mins. It was so uncomfortable. The server should've asked us our preference on the buttered plate. Then the manager walks over to the other side of the room and stares at us with his arms folded for the remainder of our dinner. We are locals, we both work in the industry & we use to recommend this place to our guests&clients all the time, we chose to dine here out of all the other steakhouses in town and it's unfortunate that we left with such a bad taste in our mouths. Definitely would not recommend.",

It may be one of the best things on the platter.  Another thing to look for, the website has a special for a meal for 2 for around $100.  A good deal for a date.",

We all started with salads or the crab cakes. Both choices were well preprepared and tasty. The table ordered a few 20oz lobster tails to share which were awesome. Everyone's steaks were cooked to order and very tender. The bottles of 2013 mica cab was an great recommendation and served at the perfect temperature. High recommend trying this place. Makes most of the restaurant that people fawn over on the strip seam subpar. Try this gem and truly enjoy your meal.",

Also, if it's undercooked they should give you a new cut. Unfortunately, they didn't satisfy either criteria. They first came back with a heated steak (which was still undercooked). They wanted to just cook it again, but then I explicitly told them we want a new cut they agreed. We had a party of 8 and that ruined the experience since everyone had to wait for me. They tried to make me feel better by giving us free fries....what the hell. We dropped 1k and you give us a free order of fries??? Very bad experience.",

That's not such a great idea if you're on a budget (like we were), but you'll quickly find out it's worth it, even if you are.  We were in a secluded room above the main dining area and had one server who was fantastic.  He had a lot of help, so the food was always hot and timely, but it was a feat nonetheless.  He was happy, knowledgeable, and on top of things.  He was also knowledgeable about Vegas and stuff to do, so he helped us with some useful ideas for what to do on Fremont St after dinner.   The food was the reason to come, though.  I ordered the Chicken Claire or Jaime (can't remember and it's not on the menu online), which was Chicken Scaloppine. Totally mind-blowing.  Best chicken I've ever had.  The guys sitting next to me with their filet and lobster were a little disappointed they didn't have what I was having.  The only problem was that there wasn't enough, after I shared it with half of the table.  The others said their dinner was really special, too.    We also had most of the sides (duck fat potatoes were the hit) and desserts (pass on the creme brulee and get the bread pudding), but the main courses were exceptional.  I'm sure there are a lot of amazing restaurants in Vegas, but this one was worth the price if you're looking for a quality steakhouse with great service.",

My fiance and I were seated on the middle level with views overlooking both the level below us and the level above us. Our server (I believe his name was Henry) was absolutely excellent! He took the time and didn't seem rushed or overwhelm when I asked for recommendations. He was genuine and it seems like all of the servers are great there!  We received this deal online which made our dinner a little cheaper, and we ordered calamari as an appetizer. It was unique and flavorful. We ordered the filet as our main along with a few side plates (fried onions, au Gratin potatoes) I ordered my filet medium well, and my fiance ordered his medium. They both came out perfect and juicy. It was amazing, however I was disappointed at the size of the side plate portions, specifically the fried onions, we could not even come close to finishing the side plates because the portions were large. Everything else was excellent and on point. We both ordered a creme brulee for dessert and it was to die for!    Thank you for this wonderful meal!",

The selection of apps and salads were wide-ranging.  Rockefeller oysters were the star for me as a Briny surprise under a gooey cheesy topping.  The crash cake was packed to the gills with lump crabmeat. Deliciously sweet and yielding meat.  For the main meal it was a delicious Tomahawk steak, prime rib And rock lobster  with sides of gratin, spinach, asparagus and onion rings.  The asparagus hit the spot as all the others were just what you would get elsewhere.    The place was small but they really deliver on exceptional service.  My wine glass was always full and they delivered the food on time.  As well they made a wonderful wedding cake for dessert.  Seriously delicious and moist!

    "text": "Pretty awesome traditional steakhouse! Nestled in the Golden Nugget downtown, V&A has that old-school feel, all dark wood and low light. It was a busy weeknight (the rodeo was in town), so while service wasn't super speedy, we were acknowledged quickly, and our server was very sweet and personable.   I had the Apple Mule, upon my server's recommendation, and it was quite tasty, a nice play on the Moscow Mule, with a green apple slice as garnish.   My business partner and I started with the calamari and crabcake as appetizers. The calamari was very good, lightly battered, tender, and piping hot. Initially, we thought there was no sauce, and requested a side of marinara. The server very nicely told us that she'd have to get it from another restaurant on property, and we told her never mind, that's ok, but she got it anyway! By that time, we'd discovered that there actually was sauce! Underneath the calamari, were sweet onions with a sweet and spicy sauce. It was great! I feel badly that she got the marinara anyway.   The crabcake... Wowzers!!! I think it was the best crabcake I've EVER tasted, and I'm a seafood fanatic. Light, barely any breading and filler, sweet, with a cream sauce.. It was amazing. I'm contemplating returning just to get another. I ate the entire thing, my partner didn't get a bite.   Now, to the meat! We both ordered the filet mignon. I ordered mine medium rare. At the first bite, I initially thought it was a little overdone, but by the third bite, it was perfect.  I think it just might not have been evenly cooked. Regardless, it was very good, and well seasoned.  We split an order of fries, and they were also tasty. Not too crisp, just enough on the outside and soft in the middle.   We didn't have enough room for dessert, so we called it an evening. The bill totaled around $150, which we thought was pretty fair.   Finally, I can check Vic & Anthony's off the list. Good showing!",

    "text": "Expected a lot as great reviews. What I got was average. Quite frankly, I will not likely be coming back because there are way better places in comparing the food that I had to other places. To start, we ordered a glass of Syrah, which was good. We both ordered the beet salad to start. It was grossly underwhelming and I do not know what kind of sauce was under it but it almost tasted similar to ranch. I would never consider ordering it again and it is one of my favorite salads at other steakhouse restaurants. I ordered the 8 ounce filet mignon medium and broccoli as a side. The filet mignon was cooked medium well, not medium, and it was closer to well. It was dry. The port wine reduction sauce that came with it, which I had to ask for, was delicious. The broccoli was very good as well. Still, the filet mignon was the main part of the show and it was a disappointment for me. I know many restaurants that just don't get this wrong so I was disappointed that this restaurant did not get it right. I did try the key lime pie for dessert and I might as well have gotten it at a regular store because there was nothing impressive about it. My friend ordered the chocolate mousse which was way too heavy, in her opinion, for a chocolate mousse, which should be light and airy. The ambience of the restaurant seems nice. The lighting is dark so there is plenty of privacy. The problem is that the service did not do very well. Initially it started nicely but toward halfway into the service and past it, it took time for the waiter to get to our table and we had to actually chase someone down 30 minutes after we were done eating just to get our bill. That was a big disappointment for us. Glad I tried it, won't be going back. Not a bad restaurant but very average which is expensive considering the prices.",

Filet was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The highlight was the crab cake appetizer.  Just perfection. Lobster bisque and scalloped potatoes were on the salty side. Also had the mac and cheese, 2 whole heads of broccoli, and caesar salad. Decent but rather unremarkable.  Croissant bread pudding was stacked high topped with caramel ice cream and the silky chocolate mousse deserts were a great ending. Really enjoyed the great service.",

The room is very comfortable, lots of wood and stained glass and two of us noticed that it was a nice change that we were able talk with out shouting even though the room was busy. Our waiter, Vic, was wonderful, very professional, and helped us thru a couple high maintenance food allergy food requests.  I started with a crab  cake - excellent, no noticeable filler, just good well seasoned crab. My friends liked their salads. I had one of the best veal chops ever, my friends had a steak and a lobster tail, both excellent, the steak cooked perfectly. The sides are  big enough to share. I thought the au gratin potatoes might have been a bit too cheesy, but still quite delicious. The wines by the glass seemed reasonable, for vegas, and the pinot noir I had was a good choice, our waiters recommendation, with the veal. The deserts were good, I had a flourless chocolate cake and it was one of the richest, best ever. We casually mentioned during the meal that all three of us were celebrating our birthdays and when the check came, the deserts had been comped. Yay! nice touch. Thanks guys.  I only have one complaint  - when our waiter delivered our steaks, he asked us to cut into the middle to check that they were cooked correctly. I HATE THAT!!!!  I expressed my hatred to that bullshit practice, perhaps a bit too enthusiastically, to our waiter. It's not voodoo, its a matter of temperature and if the \"cooks\" cant tell if the steaks are cooked to order, they shouldn't be in the kitchen or just use an instant read thermometer. In a dim room, cutting into the center is a crap shoot, you cant see well. and even if you can, I don't want  to. Hopefully he passed my message on to management.  All in all, it was an excellent dinner. Everything, food, service and ambience were great. I plan on returning soon.",

I have been to other steak house on the strip and they do no t compare in taste or price to what Vic and Anthony's has to offer. I always sit at the bar and the tenders are more than friendly and professional. I have asked for slight changes in my app and the kitchen will always accommodate, the filet always cooked to perfection. They serve a drink in a tumbler. Always good! Though someone in another review complained the key lime pie was too crusty, the key lime pie has a crust and the actual filling is the tartness it should be.",

    "text": "What can I say, this is my first 1* rating.   My girlfriend and I wanted a nice dinner in Las Vegas.  We reviewed yelp and Zagat reviews and chose this place.  The decor and ambiance are terrific, but that fell apart.  We were dressed for a 5 star meal, but not everyone in restaurant shared our wardrobe.  There was literally 5 or 6 tables were men were wearing ratty cargo shorts and tee shirts.  I saw a woman in yoga pants.  I was very disappointed to pay $50 for a steak and see someone that was barely dressed for Chipotle.    Our waiter, Jay, started out great, but fell apart later (details to follow).  We both ordered the same steak (NY Strip).   The price was $55 including the blue cheese topping.  Ala Carte, this is hefty, but I am willing to pay for quality.    My girlfriends steak was cooked well, tasted great, but was tough (very tough - we mentioned it to the manager but he did not seem concerned about it).  My steak I ordered rare.  It was medium well to well when it came out.  I cut it in half and called Jay over.  He agreed and cooked me a new one.  The steak part deux was not tough (like my girlfriends), cooked perfectly, BUT, I had asked me to put blackening seasoning on it.  I took a bite and had a Pierce Brosnan reaction in Ms. Doubtfire when his shrimp was too spicy.  They used Cajun Blackening.  This seasoning made the steak way to salty (and I like salt) and very spicy (and I like spicy).  I was not what I expected.  I informed Jay about the seasoning and he said he would investigate.  After that, we surmised Jay entered the witness protection program because we did not see him until the bill came.  This was strange, because we were discrete about our concerns.  When he did bring the bill I asked him about the seasoning and he said 'oh yeah' they ran out of regular blackening and used the Cajun instead.  True story.  I finished the steak.  When Jay did finally emerge from the shadows he inexplicably gave the check to my girlfriend (she quickly shuttle passed it to me so no damage was done to her wallet). The check included $0 off for our issues.  For newbie diners, this is NOT usual for well-dressed well-mannered diner where the kitchen screws the pooch. While I am piling on complaints, one more.  There is no restroom in the restaurant.  The restroom is literally half way across a crowded, smoky, dare I say dingy casino and that restroom, well let's just say it was not as clean as it could have been.  Again, for a high end dining place, I should not have to walk 4 minutes one way and get some free longshot horse advice from a guy in the next urinal smoking a cigar.  Not what I was expecting. Overall, maybe we got unlucky.  However, I would recommend avoiding this place for 2 reasons.  1. Do not support a fine dining restaurant that does not enforce a dress code and 2. Do not support a restaurant that cannot resolve a problem. Every casino hotel has a steakhouse, avoid this one AND the Circus Circus steakhouse.  Same problem there - no dress code, no problem resolution.",

We took my mother here for her birthday and, to the server's credit, he got us out right when we needed to be leaving for a show.  My mom and husband thought their steak and fish were very good.    The reasons for the lower starred review is that the bread and butter were nothing to write home about and the sides and salad were all mediocre/undercooked/or overpriced for what you got.  Specifically, we got the mushrooms, which were above-average, potatoes au gratin which were like a cheese soup with very little potatoes, and uncooked and underseasoned brussels sprouts.  My salad had watery tomatoes and a really bland dressing.  It was disappointing to have such crappy sides because 1) they were expensive and 2) they comprised all of my vegetarian meal.    Also, the waiter commented about three separate times about how much we must have liked our food or that we were hungry as he was clearing our plates  (rude).  Hey a**h*ole, if I'm paying about $4 per forkful, you had better believe we are eating all of it!!",

This was our first time here and I do have a few complaints as well as praises.  1) At first, when we arrived at the hotel, we were informed that we couldn't valet unless we were staying at the hotel, and that the garage sign said it was full. We drove around for about 10 minutes before asking again about the garage, and were then let in after telling the guy at the gate that we had reservations. When we got into the garage, it wasn't even close to full.  2) We called ahead and made reservations and then had to wait almost 30 minutes to be seated. There were people that just walked up before us, with no reservations and still got in before us. What's the point of making reservations?  3) The saving factor was that once we were in, the customer service was good and the food was excellent.   My wife and I had a whole lobster, which ran about $90 by itself. We had the crab cakes for the appetizer, which we shared with our friends. They ordered oysters that they shared with us.  For the main course, we both had blackened ribeye and a baked potato. We had other food that we tried as well, but when it was all said and done, we spent about $385 with tip. Our friends spent $140+ tip.  It was definitely worth it if you're looking for somewhere very nice to eat. We sat and talked for about 45 minutes after we finished the meal and they continued to serve us water and iced tea (what I had). Not once were we rushed.  If I didn't have the parking and reservation complaints above, they would have gotten 5 stars from me.",

But as the night was, I was in the company of 4 older people, all of who were not about to indulge in a steak with me and I was not about to order one of those bad boys myself.  But it looked SOOOO GOOD in the showcase.    I did have the tartar though, which they did up in small chunks, seasoned, and plated on a salt brick.  Very nice going down.  Between the 5 of us, we had seafood, seafood, and seafood.  I won't comment on the Alaskan King Crab legs because I think that they are all the same.  The AKC pasta though, was wonderfully light and fresh.  My dad had the special which was scallops, shrimp and swordfish over polenta with a baked potato on the side.  Perfectly done.  HUGE SIDES! I suggest sharing, especially if you order the mashed potatoes.     Salmon was also done well.    Nice ambiance - dark like a real classy restaurant, but like Hawaii, because it's Vegas, the dress code is not that strict.  I wore shorts. But in True Vegas fashion, there were large screen tvs through out the place that played sports non stop.  Service was great, quick and friendly.  I look forward to going back with a meat eater and killing one of those $90 porterhouses or $60 rib eyes.",

    "text": "We decided to stop into this gem of a steakhouse due being indecisive about where we wanted to eat. Little did we know it was an excellent decision. This restaurant has a ton of charm and the classy feel of an old school steakhouse restaurant. The wine selection is out of this world and the menu doesn't disappoint. My husband had the steak and lobster special and I had the stuffed salmon. Both entrees were like nothing I have ever had. Very unique and delicious! Our server (and I'm going to butcher her name, Ayko??) was fabulous. Gave us amazing drink and menu recommendations, and was at the top of her game with service. Best server we have ever had. And if you have room for desert, get the croissant bread pudding. YUM!!!",

Began with French onion soup, followed by lettuce wedge w/ Roquefort chunks, then small fillet Mignon (rare) for the entree, and ending with a desert of bread pudding to die for, (made with croissants).  --I don't usually rave about bread pudding, which you can find at any L.V. buffet, but this one was recommended to me by my server, and turned out to be incredible, (served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream).   The service was impeccable and the food was prepared flawlessly.  --One of the finest pieces of beef I've ever eaten.  I will return to Las Vegas in three weeks and Vic & Anthony's is a must.",

This is one of those spots that live up to the hype behind the reviews.  Our server was so amazing. The guy knew his stuff when it came to food and wine pairing.   A lot of yelpers talked about the lobster bisque so we had to try that. My wife said it was one of the best she ever had. The waiter even brought me a sample of the potato and cheese soup because I mentioned two my wife it sounded good. (ahh the little things) I threw down for some Kobe Beer and my lady got the Filet and Lobster (Dammnn girl *like Jaime Fox in Booty Call) Seriously her filet was so freaking good I had a little bit of food envy.   Vegas is known for getting you to stuff your belly for as cheap as possible. But Vic & Anthonys is a reason to avoid that $1.95 buffet that will call from some tums later on and spend some cash (hopefully winnings) on a great meal. Get in here and dont be afraid to order that after dinner shot of cognac, and I hate cognac but when in rome....CHEERS!!!",

Very traditional surroundings. My brother and a friend of mine loved their steaks and thought the filet mignon was one of the best they had had and cooked perfectly to their taste. The sides were good and the waiter was helpful and friendly. The only small negatives were that the restrooms were a trek through the casino which wasn't ideal and the red wine was rather too chilled. The air con was also a little fierce. We were too full for a pudding put the neighbouring table ordered what looked and they confirmed was a rather spectacular cheesecake. A lovely evening and would recommend if you are a steak lover.",

    "text": "Was sort of intrigued with the rating for the place even though it's in downtown LV. (Golden Nugget)  Typically highly rated places here don't really warrant their ratings IMO (Hugo's cellar, Second Street Grill)   I thought this place has either got to be really good or really overrated.  But since we were going to be pretty close to it around dinner, and we wanted some steak, I thought let's try it.  Got the Prime Ribeye (no bone) med rare.  Perfectly cooked, the meat had great texture throughout.  Seasoned just right as well, it was succulent and tasty.  Sometimes these prime or prime prime meats have chunks of fat in them; not this though, it was a nice and even. I even got the port peppercorn sauce on the side just in case but it wasn't really needed.  Parents had the Filet Mignon and Veal Chop.   I think my dad liked the chop since it disappeared pretty quickly.  Got the au gratin potatoes and the risotto (crab based) as sides.  The Au Gratin Potatoes had that nice deep cheddar flavor with a good crust as well.  I'm not a real 'crab' person but I appreciated how the risotto was so smooth with that good 'crabby' flavor.  Both sides were so tasty with a depth of flavor that seemed truffle oil-ish, but it wasn't overwhelming (so probably not?).  Even though we were full from that, we got the Caramel croissant bread pudding.  It comes with a scoop of ice cream and toffee chips in the sauce (see pict). Each bite was sweet and succulent.  Although price is usually a factor in my rating, this place's rating will be different.  The quality of each dish at this steakhouse matches the best steakhouse dinner I have ever had before (Mastros BH). Even being in downtown, it crushed other steaks I've had on the Strip (Craftsteak, Prime).  I haven't tried the very top steakhouses in LV but I know if I want some great steak in the future and I'm over here in downtown, I'll try to come back here again.",

Now it was time to get down to business. I was in the mood for a good cab and was poured a taste of their house...I must of had a certain look on my face because before I knew it Efrain brought me a new glass with a taste of Peju - Amazing choice. We ended up having three glasses and one of the best Manhattans in Las Vegas. For appetizers we had the Calamari which was amazing and the Bacon which was out of this world. If you only have room for one starter the Bacon should be your choice. I then had one of the best steaks I've ever had. An 8 oz filet cooked to perfection with a side of au gratin potatoes. My friend had the Chicken Paige which was an unbelievable dish too! We ended our meal with the bread pudding which sent us over the edge in a cloud nine way of course.

Although the pre-fixed menu is not offered on the menu when you enter the building it does share online if you bring the menu with you that they will offer/validate the price.    The menu included one of the following: 1.) Salad or Soup 2.) Filet Mignon/Salmon or Pasta 3.) Side dish of Au Potatoes, green beans or Creamy spinach. 4.) Dessert (I had the Creme Brule) but they also had the option of a Chocolate Cake (one other but I am not sure off hand what it was)  A few Co-Workers and I got all different dishes for our side and we were able to share them since they are more of a \"Family Style.\" All dishes were great but I would highly recommend the potatoes or creamy spinach.

Very classy place, very alert server, and one heck of a meal.  You absolutely must try the lobster bisque.  It is incredible!  Also, the oysters tasted very fresh.  Lastly, I had the lobster mac n' cheese.  It doesn't sound fancy, but it blew my mind.  They take 4oz of fresh lobster and mix it in with a super cheesy pasta dish.  They then fry an entire lobster tail and drop it on top.  It was insanely good!",

I like to play at the nugget so its pretty convenient. The mood is dark and old schoolish except for the flat screens over the bar..kinda odd..but i don't really mind it just don't ever remember seeing it before. The lobster tails are from fukushima nuclear plant....I have never seen them so big....serious 3 eye action there. All and all pretty solid..but not the best.",

    "text": "Take it from a local who has been everywhere - Vic and Anthony's is not only the best steakhouse in Vegas, It is one of the best restaurants in the whole city. Please do yourself a favor and just try this place. It is our new favorite! The prices on the strip are outrageous for what you get and quite a number don't deliver. This place is worth every penny for a special evening. My wife and I went recently to celebrate her birthday this year. The original Vic and Anthony's in Houston is consistently ranked as one of the best in the country. This is their second location, if I remember correctly, and it is every bit as good. Before I say anything about the food, let me just express how incredible the service was. From beginning to end, my wife said it was the best service she has ever experienced and she used to work in the food and service industry for years. They hire excellent people and they will take care of you. The restaurant is located in the best hotel off the strip, the Golden Nugget, and it has a beautifully focused menu. To start the lobster bisque was perfect and the crab cake - Best I have ever had. Furthermore, the drinks are excellent and well priced. The steaks are all cooked to perfection and are served all by themselves, with an optional sauce, topping or any of several sides you can order. The key here is that the steaks are of such high quality and seasoned so immaculately that they don't need anything. I am not a filet man, as like most chefs, I agree it has less flavor than other cuts. However, my surf and turf was sublime! My wife's new york was equally good. We finished with dessert wine and a killer red velvet cake. Everything will be so good you will have to share dishes just so everyone can try a few things.",

I was nervous, as a table of one (who wants a single-person table in their section?) but the waiter treated me with great respect and attention. The meal was great, cadenced almost perfectly, too. I used an Open Table dining rewards gift certificate to pay for part of my meal so that was probably annoying or alarming but I never saw that expressed on the waiter's face or heard it in his voice.  Sidenote: naturally I tipped extra as I have been a waiter for 15 years up until recently.   Enough about me -- great place to take your steak craving!",

    "text": "Vic & Anthony's has never been on my radar. In fact, when I think of steaks in Vegas I have many other places in my mental bookmarks, more flashy places like Bazaar come to mind. My point is, I am glad that my father in law took us here because otherwise I would not have come on my own.   It was my mother in law's birthday and as such she chose where we went to dinner. We (my husband and I) had just started an extremely limiting diet, but thankfully many menu items were \"compliant\" without (much) modification!  Obviously this is a steak house, but many of the non-steak options caught my attention. Organic lamb chops? Oh my God yes please. Seared ahi tuna? Sounds delicious but I can't have soy right now. Dry-aged Duroc pork chop? Seeing that I'm a big fan of aged meat (my husband is 19 years older than me after all-LOL) that is what I went with.   Aged pork (medium temp) was delicious, the dry aging really adds a whole new level of flavor, one which I've enjoyed many times with steaks..but never with pork. Thankfully my sister in law chose the lamb chops (rare temp) so I had the opportunity to sample some of that as well.. best of both worlds!  My husband got the ribeye which was also  very good. It was cooked to his temp specifications and was well seasoned. We had several sides, my favorites were the brussel sprouts and the duck fat potatoes (mmmmh, duck fat). They also pour a damn good cocktail here; I strayed a bit by drinking alcohol and ordered a Makers Mark old fashioned, which was great.",

    "text": "I was seeing a show at the Golden Nugget and I decided to try Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse for dinner.  I was taken upstairs and given the first table at the top of the stairs.  It gave me a good view down the steps of the people walking by the restaurant.  That area of the upstairs is somewhat narrow and I had my back to the room so I couldn't see more of it.  Very quickly, I was brought water and my order for iced tea was taken.  My server, Victor, came by and told me about the specials for the evening with prices--a nice touch that some restaurants don't do.  You have to ask them about the pricing.  I ordered lobster bisque for a starter, their 12 ounce filet, an order of sea salt fries (I was advised that this was small and manageable for one person, and then chocolate mousse for dessert.  I was brought warm bread and a plate with piper butter.  Nice presentation.  The lobster bisque  was finished with cognac and it had a fair amount of the cognac flavor in it.    I ordered my steak blue--Victor asked if I wanted it seared 1/3 inch on all sides and I said yes.  The steak was about 2 inches thick and the searing was just perfect for not cooking it too much.  The interior was very rare, exactly the way I like my steak.  The fries were good with a large amount of salt on them.  If you're watching your sodium intake, get something else.  When it came time for dessert, I asked for suggestions.  Victor recommended either the creme brulee or the chocolate mousse cake.  For the most part, I find creme brulee to be almost the same from one place to another so I opted for the chocolate mousse cake.  That was the correct choice.  It was creamy, chocolaty, and simply a great way to end the meal.  Service throughout was great!  My iced tea was replaced several times with no need to ask.  The only detriment was the group of five very loud men at the next table.  Because of the narrowness of the restaurant here, I heard the whole conversation including talk of Leonardo DiCaprio and other personalities from an insurance guy.  Go figure.  All this while using four letter words quite liberally.  This was something the restaurant can't control, but it was a drawback from the overall enjoyment of the meal.  Finally, you're paying close to Strip prices for a downtown steakhouse.  It is worth it because the filet was very, very good.",

It was my first time to downtown Vegas and I was expecting nothing but questionable but cheap buffets so this was a very nice upscale surprise.  I loved the atmosphere.  The darker quieter steakhouse that gives you the sense that Don Corleone is sitting in a corner.  And the only drinks you should have are either red wine or a dirty martini.   My kind of place!  The service was fine.  He was friendly and informative but I would have preferred a little more energy.       I ordered the 8oz filet and although it was good, I have to say I have had better at both Mastro's and N9NE.   The perfect medium was just not as tender as I had hoped.  The brussel sprouts were amazing!   Probably the best I have ever had.  However, the au gratin potatoes were strange.  I guess I'm just used to them in layers but they were potato chunks in a very yellow cheese sauce.  Almost tasted like velveeta.  I would have probably gotten something different.  All in all a positive experience and I'm glad I tried it, but would probably try other steakhouses before coming back.",

Over cooked on the outside, undercooked on the inside medium rare steak for $100 (something we absolutely never spend that much money on but were splurging for a special occasion). I should know, an Italian restaurant where the free bread isn't very good at all is going to be awful... Crab cake \"appetizer\" was so heavy & filling with so much buttery sauce we were feeling full & sick before we got the entree. Everything here is low quality & full of fat in the worst way. My chicken was over cooked & the oil was pooling in a way that made me sick & I honestly started to cry at how awful the meal was & how much my anniversary was ruined. Thankfully sending it back (which I absolutely never do as a Chef) resulting in just paying for the wine. The wine selection being the literal only thing that one star is good for.

Overall I feel that it's better than a 4 Star, but I can't give a quarter or half. For a upper quality steakhouse, the prices are pretty much in line with the others.   This year we had the roast quail in chipotle glaze and the crab cake. Both were exceptional. The crab cake might be the best I've ever had.  My wife had the salmon which she thought was ok, but could have had a bit more flavor. I had the bone in rib eye with the bourdelaise sauce and the sides of scalloped potatoes and mushrooms. The one thing about V & C is that they tend to undercook the steaks. This is the second year where I have had to send back the steak because it was rare rather than medium rare. If was better when they flashed it for a couple minutes, but the crust was a bit burnt after that.  The previous year they undercooked my wife's and they gave her the steak for free after they re-cooked it and it came out medium instead of medium rare. When they get the steaks right though, they are very good.  As for the sides...they are big enough for two people, maybe even three. The scallop potatoes are almost to rich. I love my cheese, but these potatoes are cheese bombs. Really hard to eat more than a few bites because the the richness. The mushrooms were very good. I've had the creamed spinach before and that was super rich as well.   Service is excellent. Love that they fill your water every few minutes. They are also understanding if something is not to your liking and very well may comp your for it.   I'd say give it a try for sure. Probably not the best steakhouse in Vegas, but one of the top ones for sure. We also like Binion's Steakhouse.",

    "text": "(Review based on 3.5 stars)  Located at The Golden Nugget in Downtown Las Vegas, directly across from the Chocolate Box and very close to the hotel lobby check in.  My husband and I arrived here for dinner on Christmas day while spending a little vacation getaway in Las Vegas. We arrived right on time for our 5:30 pm reservations (another couple had walked in and asked how long would the wait be since they did not have a reservation and the seating hostess told him it would be about 45 minutes).   After we were seated and greeted by our server (unfortunately I do not recall his name), we were given menus. We ended up ordering:  Sourdough Bread- This basket of complementary bread was pretty \"meh\". Although it was served warm, it did not have much of a taste. It is served with butter (with good reason). But since we were both feeling hungry, we ended up eating 1/2 of it.   Jump Lump Crab Cake, $21 prior to tax- Although this crab cake was a large size (and a fair amount to share for 2 as an appetizer), I wasn't really impressed with it. I thought the breading was not seasoned well. But the crab pieces itself was good. The butter sauce on this crab cake was good but the crab was good all by itself. I wouldn't say this is worth ordering again.  Roasted Salmon, $32 prior to tax- This salmon is served on a bed of potato puree (mashed potatoes) and a delicious lump of crab. This dish is also served with asparagus. I had requested for the asparagus to be steamed. According to our server, normally the asparagus is sauteed in butter. I thought this salmon was perfectly cooked. The sauce was wonderful and I liked the diced tomatoes on the salmon. However I didn't find the capers to really enhance the flavor of the salmon and rather overpowered the delicate flavors of the fish. The crab cake that was served was much better seasoned and better tasting than our appetizer. The portion of this entree is more than perfect for one person.   Prime Ribeye (16 oz), $47 prior to tax- My husband ordered this (since he is a big steak fan and we are in a steak house). We were both actually surprised that this prime ribeye entree was just meat and no side like my salmon. When we had dined at other steakhouses in the past, the steak entree always comes with some kind of vegetable and/ or starch. So this was a little disappointing. In general, the prime rib was cooked a bit more than my husband wanted (he ordered it medium rare). But the steak was still juicy. It would have been nice to have an accompaniment of sauces to be served with this steak (unfortunately that is not free).   Haricot Verts, $10 prior to tax- I requested to have these green beans steamed. Normally this would be served with a buttery sauce. I thought these green beans were cooked perfectly. It was nice to be able to taste the natural sweetness and tenderness of the vegetables.   -------------------------- (Total= $150 after tax and tip)  This was quite a special meal for us to celebrate Christmas. Our server in general was friendly. But was not quite as attentive, but that seems to be the norm for steak houses (so that isn't what caused me to deduct stars on this rating).   We were disappointed with my husband's entree not coming with a side dish, also disappointed that his steak was cooked a little more than he had requested. We were also disappointed with the bread they served (thank goodness it was free at least because we have been to a steakhouse that served bread for a $5 charge and it wasn't even good). Another thing that did annoy my husband was that there is no restroom inside this restaurant. And so you have to use the restaurant in the casino (a short walk, but you still have to leave the restaurant to use it). And lastly, the crab cake we ordered as an appetizer was not worth it. Overall. this place is worth a solid 3.5 stars.  The couple next to our table did order the bread pudding and it truly looked amazing but we were too full to make an order. If you do come here, I would recommend you consider making room for this dessert.   By the way, this restaurant will validate your parking ticket for 3 hours. (Parking is not free at the Golden Nugget unfortunately but with validation and for hotel guest only it is free).",

The small but lively bar is a pretty good spot to watch a game and devour some meat.",

    "text": "Pros and Cons to this place. We wanted to go to a vintage Vegas steakhouse and picked this one. The look is great..very dark, cool pictures.  Our server was great. Fantastic food too. However, given the prices,  I expected a more upscale place. Jackets for men are requested but not required per their website so I figured it would be a nice fine dining experience. But not even close. People in jeans and tshirts. One left his cowboy hat on (rodeo was in town). But the most annoying part was the larger table in the corner hootin and hollerin, forcing everyone in the place to yell to be heard. Meanwhile the manager and some servers were busy chatting up some couple, I assume friends or something, and didn't pay attention to anything else. Yeah, I know I sound old and crotchety but come on people. Have some class. So basically good food but you're not going to get that fine dining experience you might assume or be looking for. Maybe stick to the 'new' strip.",

    "text": "There's something special about steakhouse's located in Downtown Las Vegas. My husband and I came here for a romantic date night. We'd heard so much about the service and food and the restaurant lived up to the hype!   FOOD & DRINKS: We had the Bone Marrow w/ bruschetta, which is a phenomenal dish. However, it is heavy. I was only about to eat about half the bone marrow before I was ready to move on to something lighter. My two favorite dishes was the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake and Steak tartare, which was both the best I've ever had! I would come back to just eat both dishes all day. The crab cake was juicy, meaty and the sauce really made it a well-rounded appetizer. The steak tartare was unique and different. The rare steak went well with the chips and whole grain mustard. It's served on top of a Himalayan Salt Block too! The steak was tasty and cooked well.   SERVICE: Excellent service, but they did seat us near the entrance so it was a little noisy and we were hit a few times by the traffic coming in and out of the entrance.   AMBIANCE: Typical steakhouse that is dark and busy with a lot of fun conversations happening around us, which I absolutely love!  PRICE: Great value for what we received. The dishes were unique, the presentation was pretty and the service was great.   Overall, I give this place a 4 out of 5. I would definitely come back again. :-)   Happy DIning,   J Tran",

The asparagus were the size of small trees (not my preference). But here's where the 3 star review comes into play... the steak. I mean it's a steakhouse. A $50 steak should taste, well amazing. Unfortunately it didn't. I ordered the 16 oz prime ribeye. I've had better steaks at the Texas Roadhouse. Not only was it improperly seasoned (under seasoned) it was overly charred and fairly tough. Definitely not a $50 steak. More like a $12.99 steak at best. Hopefully I'm in the minority but my experience fell short of s 4.5 star rated steakhouse in Vegas.",

    "text": "I love, love, LOVE this restaurant! It's the second time we've been here (first time was last year), and so now it's kind-of a tradition for celebrating the completion of our annual Fantasy Football draft. Plus, this year we stayed at the Golden Nugget, so it was sooooo convenient not having to leave the hotel to get to a quality steak dinner.  Tip 1: Make reservations, if you can. Really helps, especially if you have a larger group (we had 7ppl).  Tip 2: If you're not already, become a member of Landry's Select Club, since Vic & Anthony's is part of that (along with Claimjumper and Chart House, among others). You score point and earn rewards, which is cool.  Tip 3: Check the Landry's website for deals, because they can worth a lot and just awesome. Case in point: 6 of the 7 of us used the \"Distinctive Dining Deal\" they were running...a 3-course meal for only $52. Seriously, only $52. First course was lobster bisque or caesar salad; second course was protein (8oz filet mignon, salmon, or shrimp scampi) and side (broccoli, onion strings, au grain potatoes, or cream corn), and dessert (creme brulee, chocolate mousse cake, or croissant bread pudding). And let me tell y'all, the portions were not scaled down...they were the full, real deal.  I started with the lobster bisque, which was flavorful and chock-full of lobster. Sooooo delicious. For the second round, I went with the shrimp scampi, which consisted of 6 large shrimp with lemon and a bit of bite from the seasoning. I picked the onion strings as my side, but between 6 of us ordering a huge side each, we all shared all four sides, and each was fantastic. Lastly, 4 of us had the chocolate mousse cake, and 2 had the croissant bread pudding. We were all so full from the amount of food we already had, none of us finished our dessert, but gave it the ol' college try.  Our server was great, and we had absolutely no issues with anything. Food came out in perfect order at the perfect temperature. The drinks were kept refilled at all times, and the bar orders came out quickly and flavorful (not watered down, decent size).  Give this great steakhouse a try, folks! I know we love it, and we'll be back :)",

He displayed a bit of attitude that I did not appreciate and felt he rushed us on our order on his return. Later through the night he apologized how  he handled situation.  I also asked how comp food vs tipping is handled. He replied I don't know, it seemed more like he did not care. I discussed this with Casino Host Winnie about the situation.

The seasoning is wonderful. Sides are served family style, so I recommend sharing. However, even knowing this, my husband and I always order two. We figure it will be awhile before we get here again. The asparagus is decadent. We tried it grilled this time. It had a lovely balsamic reduction, which was fantastic. The au gratin potatoes were also delicious.

    "text": "I wasn't impressed. In fact, I wish we would've followed my instinct to just go back to N9NE.   We started out with Caesar salads. They were good.  I ordered the Chefs Special; an 8 oz filet and lobster with pureed potatoes. Not sure they know how to. cook a steak medium well vice medium. I asked for my filet to be cooked medium well. It came out medium. Our server then proceeded to take the steak off my plate so that they could cook it to medium well. When it came back out it was significantly charred on the outside, and still medium on the inside - unbelievable.  The lobster was delicious. It was served atop a garlic butter sauce. This was the perfect accompaniment. The pureed potatoes were too salty to eat.  My mate ordered the ribeye. From my understanding it was just \"alright\".   We also ordered the scalloped potatoes. They were good but very rich.   The manager comped my filet and offered to have something else made for me, but I politely declined.   We thought we'd pay our bill and then hit the strip, but suddenly a ginormous piece of red velvet cake and two mini cakes aside it came to our table. We were informed that the cake was made in house. We were doubtful of this as it was ice cold and appeared to be store bought. It was okay nevertheless.  Will I return? No. There are too many far better steakhouses in Las Vegas.  5 stars for the service. 2.5 stars for the food. My total rating for Vic & Anthony's is 3 stars.",

Not only is it decorated fabulously vintage black and white pics of Vegas and old stars, but the dimmed lighting, leather seats and impeccably dressed wait staff provided for a classy and romantic evening.  The wait staff was the exceptional. Our waiter was friendly and professional, and never over bearing with his attention. The Crab cake was quite sizable and full of large lumps of crab. The rib eye steak was cooked perfectly to order, medium rare. And the salmon was moist and not overly cooked.",

I'm not sure what it was, but maybe $100 should have brought something a bit better. The butter was terrible and after making a request for some different kind, it wasn't much better. My wife chose not to continue to complain about it though despite management's offer to make it right. We didn't  see the point in waiting for another lobster tail when it would most likely taste the same. Once again the steak was amazing though and the service was very good as well. Perhaps, we will go back, but will definitely skip the lobster tail!",

I've had a few steaks on the menu, all of which were incredible, but my personal favourite is the veal chop. It is so mouth wateringly delicious and getting sweat on my brow typing about it.

Service - fantastic and very helpful and knowledgeable their wine list was extensive so this helped narrow the choices to type and profile we were looking for   2.  Food - best Filet I have ever had.  So tender almost felt I could of just cut it with my fork.  There was a special that night filet and Lobster tail which was also fantastic.   We also split a wedge and an order of oysters Rockefeller both were on point the wedge used Roquefort dressing and it was phenomenal   Been to many great steakhouses around the country Vic and Anthony's is among the best experiences I have had",

    "text": "There are some experiences in life you have to live at least once, and dinner at Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse is definitely one of them.   I've had the privilege of coming here for a third time; two previously with my fave uncle, and this time with my husband, my cousin, and her husband. We sat at a table tucked in a balcony area, where our server, Ben, gave us superb service as he provided us with dinner specials, suggestions for drink pairings, a little bit of history, and entertaining jokes throughout our evening.   The four of us shared a bottle of Pinot Noir that Ben recommended. We followed this delicious and smooth wine with individual cocktails, I had the Spiced Pear Martini, which might not have been the best choice to pair with my filet and lobster tail, but it hit a great spot my taste buds were desiring.   We shared a calamari appetizer that was mixed with shishito peppers. The plate was just right for the four of us, especially since two of us aren't big fans of this particular seafood.   For our second course, we chose different salads. I enjoyed the heirloom tomato penzanella, which seemed to be a variation of caprese. It was rich, light, and scrumptious. Around the rest of the table were Caesar salaf and Spinach salad.   The main course consisted of two specials of 8oz filet and I think 12oz lobster tails with fingerling potatoes and sauteed mushrooms (yellowfoot, bluefoot...and one other that I can't recall at the moment, mostly because I have them to my man to enjoy since he is the only fun-guy I like! lol). The other two plates were filled with porter house ribeyes that my cousin and my husband savored until they couldn't eat anymore. Yes, leftover meat taken back to the room and chewed up for breakfast.   Our additional sides were au gratin potatoes, roasted Brussels sprouts, asparagus, and in house made creamed corn. We covered the table with our feast, everything set in a wonderful presentation, flavored amazingly, and eaten with great delight.   Ben paid attention when we mentioned we were there to celebrate my cousin and her husband's wedding anniversary, and he generously brought out a creme brulee with a candle. It was just the right amount of sweet for four spoons that filled us to our limit.   It was a fabulous evening of food, conversation, service and overall memory making that the four of us will get to share and enjoy the rest of our days.",

    "text": "If you've ever eaten at an upscale restaurant on the strip, you probably have had the experience of feeling like you're in a fishbowl with everyone staring at you & judging how you're dressed. I know I have.   What I really liked about dining at Vic & Anthonys, apart from the food (which was fabulous, more on this in a minute) was that I didn't get that \"fishbowl feeling.\"  Not once. And the service was just as good as any of the five-star dining experiences on the strip. There were waiters, bussers, and servers filling your cup at every turn, never intrusive, always on the ball. I was impressed.   The ambiance is old-school Vegas steakhouse, with old black & white photographs of celebrities gracing the walls, dark wood, wrought iron details, and lighting which made it cozy but not so dark that you couldnt read your menu (dont you hate that?)  We ordered the lobster bisque with cognac - some of the best bisque Ive ever had - and the quail for an appetizer. Id never tried quail before, it was tender, juicy, and the skin was crisped perfectly. My mouth is watering now just thinking about it!  I ordered the stuffed salmon in an attempt to eat (somewhat) healthfully. Salmon can be iffy, but I figured this place got a 4.5 stars, its bound to be good. I was mot disappointed. Wow, was it good! Lots of capers, just the right amount of sauce, i savored every bite. Surprisingly, the mashed potatoes were some of the best Ive ever had at a restaurant. My hubby was sneaking bites of them off my plate!  He ordered the special, a snapper dish that he also enjoyed immensely.   Then we shared the vanilla bean creme brulee, which was big enough for two and also some of the best creme brulee ive ever had.   Thats three items that were the top of the list for me, EVER. Id say that makes this place a 5+ stars.   A few side notes: there seemed to be a lot of men dining here with other men. I think the ambiance made them feel more comfortable (back to the goldfish bowl thing again).  Also, it WAS pricey. Most of the entrees were in the $40- $50 range. A few were lower, like the chicken and salmon. The alcohol was pricey too, the low end was $15 per glass. You're not going to get away with less than $100 for two. More like $200. But well worth it for a special occasion.   Hubby said he'd love to make this his go-to place for special occasions. I wholeheartedly agree.  Kudos to the Golden Nugget. I really enjoyed dining here and will certainly do so again.",

It was only due booking a hotel for a last minute trade show that we found ourselves at this hotel and had no other choice for dinner as all other reservations in the city were completely filled. But I am happy to say Vic and Anthony's became the shining, mouth-watering, reputation boosting, savior of my entire stay.  I've had Morton's, Mastro's, and Ruth Chris, and honestly on more than one of my visits to these places, I've had to send my steak back due to it being overcooked or undercooked, and once received the most horrid service.  The 21oz bone in rib eye was nothing less than DIVINE. And standing at 5'1\" 105 lbs, I ate every single last bite of it, down to scraping off the bone.   Every single bite was so tender, juicy, and full of flavor and as consistent as it could be throughout. I've found in other rib eyes, the outer rim of the steak was always much more well done than the center. Our waiter was so helpful and suggested that we order the steak rare, since the plate is very hot and it will continue to cook at the table. I am so thankful we did this as my steak was a consistent medium rare throughout the entire meal.   We shared a crabcake for an appetizer, and all I have to say is you MUST get this. I was worried about it being too heavy before our entrees but there is very little breading, so it was more crab than cake, which worked wonderfully.  We were a party of 3 and ordered a side of broccoli (which comes out in 3 GIANT florets, simply cooked) and a side of the duck fat potatoes. The duck fat potatoes were fingerling potatoes soaked in a confit, and i simply must order anything and everything with the word \"confit\". However, these were a bit underwhelming. Definitely delicious but they actually just tasted like breakfast potatoes. Which felt out of place with everything else we were eating.  We also ordered a side of bearnaise and peppercorn sauce for our steaks. I ended up not using either as I thought the steak was perfectly delicious on its own.  I guess I'll be coming back to the Golden Nugget after all.",

    "text": "This is my second time to Vic & Anthonys and i was really impressed with both the service and the food on my first visit a couple of years ago but a couple of things on this visit was not quite up there at the \"Vic & Anthony Standard\". I started with the Tuna tartare with citrus vinaigrette and chips. The tuna was really fresh and high quality and with the classic company of avocado and the crispy chips it was a great start. My company had the scallops with appleslaw/bacon and a tabascovinaigrette. This was even better then mine and the combination of perfectly seared scallops and the appleslaw together with the spicyness of the tabascovinaigrette was awesome!   For a maincourse i took the medium file that was juicy and good pared with a peppercorn sauce that was ok but nothing special. Me and my company shared a side of mashed potatoes and this was the big dissapointment. I prefer my mash silky smooth like for example at the Boa Steakhouse in L.A or the now closed Dakota Steakhouse but this mash was full of lumps and the potatoes had its skin left. I know that some people think lumpy mash has this good old home feeling but that aside the mash lacked any flavor. So this was a real downside.   I rounded of the dinner with a classic creme brulee with berrys wich was good but nothing i will remember. My companys chocolate cake was a step up and she was really happy with it.   If the steaks and vibe of the place is worth a 4 there something more then the bad mash wich brings the points down. The service was not close to the service i remembered from my first visit. Our waiter made us feel rushed and felt a bit annoyed by the fact that we wanted to eat the appetizer before deciding on our main dishes. Whats the problem?   So for us the appetizers wich should not be missed gets 4,5 , the steaks gets 4, the sides and the service gets 2. All and all a solid 3 pointer. Would go back but hopefully get a better waiter. And skip the mash and try the gratin or potatoes lyonaise instead.",

I had a wedge salad, crab cake and lobster bisque. Holy cow, it was amazing. We had an awesome server, and the place is so classy and nice.   I've spent the last year dreaming about that crab cake, btw. UGH. The next time I come to Vegas I promise you the first thing I do will be getting one of those crab cakes!",

    "text": "This place is seriously amazing. 5+++ stars with a silver lining that shines.  I made reservations here for a pre-birthday dinner after seeing some of the reviews on yelp & taking in different factors (price, food variety, wine list.) Seriously did not disappoint & the food lived up to the hype. Quite possibly one of the top 2 most delicious filet mignons I've ever had in my life - and I have had my fair share, it's usually my go-to.   Reservations were for 4, and I decided to have their prix-fix which included lobster bisque, filet mignon, creamed spinach & creme brulee all for $50. The filet alone was worth $50 and everything else was delicious too... I actually gave my meat an applause & saluted the last piece before I ate it. If a vegetarian would have tried it, I'm sure they would have been happy that the animal turned into a fine mouthwatering morsel. Life changing it was.  Other food at the table included an oyster platter, where the oysters were very big but our oyster expert friend was amazed at how good they were for being so big (I don't eat them.) A wedge salad that looked big & satisfying, a large cheese & meat plate that our friends mostly wrapped up to eat later. My dinner date had some chocolate cake souffle thing and I - who doesn't care a whole lot for chocolate - would really like to eat it again.   If you love wine - they have an amazing wine list as well. I only had a Malbec & a sparkling wine but I could have moved into their wine cellar.   Ambiance was great, staff was pleasant & attentive, the only thing I could possibly think of that I didn't like was the restrooms were out in the casino. But I'll gladly walk 10 times for the food here, especially with great service at a decent price.  Everyone in our group loved it & will definitely be going back!",

We even got to meet the Chef to tell him how great the meal was.  Wedge salad was beautiful and delicious, but the star of the show was the lobster tail.  It was more than enough for two of us to share and was cooked absolutely perfectly.  I don't remember having better lobster anywhere.  We also loved the au gratin potatoes-rich, cheesy, and delicious.  The old school vibe brought me back to what I imagine it was like in the old days of Vegas.  Very relaxing.  Vic and Anthony's knocked it out of the park!  Fantastic experience from beginning to end.  We will definitely return on our next trip.",

I've been to other steak houses that were hit or miss, but not here!  Best damn crab cake outside of the North East. True lumpy crab meat, not all shredded up and mixed with fillers.  Great oysters rockefeller.  Insane scallops and grits with tobacco vinaigrette!  An australian lobster tail that probably can feed 3.  And how do you add to the creaminess of ice cream? By adding foie gras! So they did. It sounds crazy, but very good! We walked out of here 5 pounds heavier, with smiles on our faces.",

    "text": "I think after reading the reviews from everyone we had really really high expectations and few were met. This place is good but nothing to run home and tell my mom about.   Pros: Server was kind, food was served quickly, steak was cooked as we asked, proportions were large, drinks were strong, dessert was comped because we were celebrating our anniversary, water glasses were always promptly refilled  Cons: We were NEVER addressed by our last names although we had a reservation, tons of people were wearing shorts and flip flops, we were never offered bottled water (automatically served tap), not the best steak we've ever had :(  For appetizers we ordered the crab cake, one large cake with a butter sauce that is richer than Bill Gates and the oysters Rockefeller, good but was just an oyster with spinach, bread crumbs and cheese. Entrees were both steak, better than most places but nowhere near the best. For sides we had the au gratin potatoes which needed more potatoes for all the cheese and creamed spinach which was a bowl of the same stuff on top of our oysters Rockefeller. Dessert was pretty darn good though. Croissant bread pudding was the highlight of our meal.  Bottom line is that the place is good but not great, I say check out the band in the lounge area....they are awesome!!! Prime in the Bellagio and Anthonys in The M Resort are still my top two steaks in Vegas!",

The salad was great, my husbands ribeye was very tender but my filet mignon was way too dry, and lacked flavor. The asparagus lacked flavor as well.

I had the bone in filet, which was very tender, I'd guess 14oz as advertised but really tasteless. After two bites and a conversation with our waiter, I was compelled to order a sauce to add some taste.  It helped but I was charged the three bucks for the sauce -which I thought odd under the circumstances. Additionally this steak was $67.00!  Now I try to never let the price of a meal affect my opinion but I must admit it may have this time.  Steak gets a shaky C.  As a a side we had the chips and strings and they were OK but pale in comparison to The Palms version. (B-).  The hostess greeting was OK, if a bit lackluster but we found it odd that a couple who checked in right behind us without a reservation were seated ahead of us (we had reservations). Give her a C.  Our waiter was competent but offered little help in menu discussion, showed no personality and seemed to be doing little other than going through the motions. Another C.  Landry's and The Golden Nugget need much more from this place if they want to compete with the strip.  Our meal at Andiamo (at the D) was far superior in every way.",

I wanted a vermouth - they didn't have the very specific one I was looking for but they gave me a short pour of a really perfect replacement on the house. My partner and I both ordered steak, he started with the roasted bacon and I ordered the bisque.   The bacon was just absolutely sublime, but the portion was far too large. It was a full 8oz of bacon, people. In two rashers. They were enormous. But the fat rendered perfectly, and they really were delicious. The bisque was standard steakhouse lobster bisque - good, but nothing lifechanging, which is fine.  My steak was cooked perfectly, but there just was something...not great about it. It was a bit chewy, and required a bearnaise. Last year when I was in Vegas I went to Cut and had the steak I compare all steaks to, and this one didn't meet that standard.   We ordered coffees, and split. I didn't see the bill.  The place was convenient (right in the hotel!), the service was phenomenal, and the food was about what I'd expect. Not a bad choice, and probably the best choice on Fremont street (unless you're in the mood for chicken in which case go to Chart House).",

Scallops cooked perfectly, the potatoes au gratin were the best I've ever had! All that being said the steaks were still the star!! We were too full for dessert but finished with a 100 proof Irish whiskey the bartenders recommended that perfectly finished off the experience! With full bellies and hot cheeks we hit the floors to gamble.  Definitely a recommend!!",

Delicious ribeye cooked medium rare along with a side of potatoes and asparagus, both sides are big enough to share. Thanks to Shawn for picking out our wine and servers Luciano and John who both took great care of us on separate nights. Next time I'm in town I'll make sure to come back!",

    "text": "Wife and I ate here the first day we got to Vegas.  After a 6 hour flight and time spend getting to the hotel we were looking for a nice quiet dinner.  We were not disappointed.  We both thought it wouldn't be too busy on a Tuesday evening, but we were wrong.  It was about an hour to hour and a half wait, but that is on us, since we didn't make reservations.  They did take my cell phone # and would call when our table was ready.  We headed out to the casino.   I got a call after about an hour and we headed back to the restaurant.  The atmosphere is dark, quite, very nice.  We received bread and water almost immediately after we were seated.  Our waiter came over and went through the specials and menu.  We ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad for an appetizer.  I ordered the special which was a filet with three shrimp in scampi sauce, garlic mashed potatoes,and sauteed fresh vegetables.  My wife opted for the ribeye with baked potato.  We received our appetizer quickly and it had been split onto two plates which was nice.  Our steaks arrived shortly after we finished the appetizer.  Our waiter asked us to cut into them to check that they were done to our liking and they were.  The filet was melt in your mouth tender.  The veggies were a little under cooked, but I like them al dente.  The mashed potatoes had way too much garlic for my taste and I really like garlic.  My wifes steak had that nice intense beef flavor and was cooked perfectly.  The skin on her baked potato was a little tough, but inside was light and fluffy.  The service was awesome and we had a truly pleasant dining experience and were able to de-stress after traveling.",

It was dimly lit, great pictures on the wall, inside the Golden Nugget and just the perfect MAN CAVE.  Big goblets of wine, very attentive staff and the food was excellent.    I suggest the bone-in rib-eye...you will not be disappointed. Typing about it now makes me want to go back.  The sides are huge and enough to share so - if you have a table of four - each of you get different sides so you can try something else.  The onion straws, the sauteed mushrooms, the potatoes...all excellent!  I love this place and would go back in a heartbeat and would tell everyone to check it out!   It's totally worth it!  Plus...you're in Vegas, c'mon! Live a little!!!",

    "text": "Once again, yelpers did not disappoint!  Based on the reviews, I ordered the bone-in rib-eye, which my partner and I shared.    It was juice and flavorful and even though it was pink and bleeding just a little (which would ordinarily gross us both out), we thoroughly enjoyed it.   We very nearly went back the next night to have the identical steak but couldn't justify being in Vegas and not trying another glam restaurant.  (We headed to the Eiffel Tower restaurant instead.)  We also ordered the steakhouse fries and the green beans, both of which were not stellar.   I was also not impressed with the creme brulee -- not warm enough and just didn't have the kind of flavorful zing to justify all those calories.   We're not big wine drinkers and relied on the waiter to suggest something.  He suggested a $20 glass which we passed up so he brought us a taste of the Shiraz instead.  I could swear that the full pour he brought was not the wine we tasted.  In fact, it tasted damn near close to two-buck chuck shiraz.    However the steak was the saving grace.  If I went back, I would have ordered different side dishes and not relied on the waiter for the wine (or get a cocktail instead), but that steak justifies the 4 stars.",

She wasn't stuffy or snobby like some of the waiters at the tables near us.  We ordered;  fresh water oysters  wedge salad with blue cheese crumbles  2 bone in rib-eyes  au gratin potatoes  asparagus  shiner bock  tea   The oysters were surprisingly good. We'd never tried freshwater before. The wedge salad was basically a half head of lettuce. I wasn't expecting it to be that big. The crumbled blue cheese was really good. The steaks were as big as my head. They were cooked to order, juicy, and delicious. The au gratin potatoes were all right. It tasted like they just melted Velveeta cheese over the top. And the asparagus were cooked just right.  Was it expensive? Yes ($200; tip included).  Was it worth it? Definitely!  I mean, it's not like you do this everyday. And, you're on vacation. So splurge!",

    "text": "Absolutely incredible steak and a great meal overall. The Golden Nugget had a ad in the room that you can take the restaurant where you get an appetizer (I got the Wedge Salad), main course (8oz  filet mignon and mash potatoes for me) and a desert (Went with the chocolate cake) for less than $50, a great deal. It was one of the best steaks I've ever eaten, no joke.   The side that you get is more than enough for two people, so my wife and I ordered two different sides, she got the creamed spinach, both were excellent. The service of course is top notch. I didn't eat much of the desert, not only because I was really full from the meal, but the chocolate cake was really too rich for me. However, I loved the steak so much, I could have cared less about the cake!  It is pricey of course, but if you're staying on Fremont and want to go all out for one a great meal, this is a good spot to do it!",

One of the men at the table never partakes of dessert and he ate almost half of it  !!!  You have to try it.  It is definitely 5 stars.  Yum.  Yum.

I had the filet mignon 8 oz which was cooked to perfection and a side of the Brussels sprouts which was great. When the food came to our table (of 4), it was all extremely hot which makes you feel like it just came out of the kitchen and straight to your table, none of this waiting under a heat lamp for service. One of my friends happened to look online and find a great 3 course alternate menu for a significantly cheaper price than if you ordered it all separately.  It was presented to us by the server from her billfold when we inquired about it, leading us to believe it is a unadvertised special. It must be asked for. A few small complaints, which are actually pretty minor, the wine list is veeeeeery long. Almost overwhelmingly long, it took us forever just to decide on a wine to enjoy with dinner. Also, you must physically leave the restaurant and walk through the casino to find a bathroom.  However our server was great and the staff was fantastic. Plates cleared within seconds of finishing. Enjoy!",

The setting is really romantic and we were upstairs in a private area with only a few other tables.  The lobster bisque is truly the best I have ever had with chunks of Maine lobster. The portobello mushroom app was large with large chunks of tomato, mozzarella & basil.  I had the chilean seabass a la nage at it was buttery and amazing.  My fiance had a 4 1/2 lobster ($140) (the waiter recommended we share but it was his birthday) and he couldn't even eat half of it but it was cooked perfectly! I had creme brulee served in a wide, narrow dish so there was a lot of crust and it was pretty good and they brought the birthday boy a beautiful (complimentary) croissant bread pudding that was pretty great!  This place is high end so it isn't cheap but I thought it was worth the money!  Victor was a truly gracious waiter and glasses never were empty and he anticipated everything. The only thing I didn't love was the hot tea; it was bitter but I just assume the water was too hot so it didn't steep properly.  Definitely will be back.  For a great deal, go to their website for the \"distinctive\" dinner...four courses for $50!  I had it and was so full I couldn't move!",
